AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a genetically 
      heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders generally caused by single 
      nucleotide variants (SNVs) or indels in coding regions or by repeat expansions in 
      coding and noncoding regions of SCA genes. Copy number variants (CNVs) have now 
      also been reported for 3 genes-ITPR1, FGF14, and SPTBN2-but not all SCA genes 
      have been screened for CNVs as the underlying cause of the disease in patients. 
      In this study, we aim to assess the prevalence of CNVs encompassing 36 known SCA 
      genes. METHODS: A cohort of patients with cerebellar ataxia who were referred to 
      the University Medical Center Groningen for SCA genetic diagnostics was selected 
      for this study. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was 
      performed using the Infinium Global Screening Array. Following data processing, 
      genotyping data were uploaded into NxClinical software to perform CNV analysis 
      per patient and to visualize identified CNVs in 36 genes with allocated SCA 
      symbols. The clinical relevance of detected CNVs was determined using evidence 
      from studies based on PubMed literature searches for similar CNVs and phenotypic 
      features. RESULTS: Of the 338 patients with cerebellar ataxia, we identified 
      putative clinically relevant CNV deletions in 3 patients: an identical deletion 
      encompassing ITPR1 in 2 patients, who turned out to be related, and a deletion 
      involving PPP2R2B in another patient. Although the CNV deletion in ITPR1 was 
      clearly the underlying cause of SCA15 in the 2 related patients, the clinical 
      significance of the deletion in PPP2R2B remained unknown. DISCUSSION: We showed 
      that CNVs detectable with the limited resolution of SNP array are a very rare 
      cause of SCA. Nevertheless, we suggest adding CNV analysis alongside SNV analysis 
      to SCA gene diagnostics using next-generation sequencing approaches, at least for 
      ITPR1, to improve the genetic diagnostics for patients.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a genetic degeneration disease of the 
      nervous system with ataxia as the main clinical manifestation, and the most 
      frequent subtype of SCA3 is known to be caused by CAG repeat expansions of more 
      than 55 units in ATXN3. In this study, we used peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
      (PBMCs) from a volunteer with 14/63 CAG repeats in ATXN3 to generate induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which will be a good model for studying SCA3.

TI  - Prevalence of repeat expansions causing autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      ataxias in Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan.
LID - 10.1038/s10038-023-01200-x [doi]
AB  - In Japan, approximately 30% of spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) is hereditary, 
      and more than 90% of hereditary SCD is autosomal dominant SCD (AD-SCD). We have 
      previously reported the types of AD-SCD in Hokkaido, twice. In this study, we 
      investigated the status of AD-SCD mainly due to repeat expansions, covering the 
      period since the last report. We performed genetic analysis for 312 patients with 
      a clinical diagnosis of SCD, except for multiple system atrophy at medical 
      institutions in Hokkaido between January 2007 and December 2020. The median age 
      at the time of analysis was 58 (1-86) years. Pathogenic variants causing AD-SCD 
      due to repeat expansion were found in 61.5% (192 cases). Spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) 6 was the most common type in 25.3% (79 cases), followed by Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD)/SCA3 in 13.8% (43), SCA1 in 6.4% (20), SCA2 in 5.1% (16), SCA31 in 
      4.8% (15), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy in 4.8% (15), SCA7 in 0.6% (2), 
      and SCA8 in 0.6% (2). SCA17, 27B, 36, and 37 were not found. Compared to previous 
      reports, this study found a higher prevalence of SCA6 and a lower prevalence of 
      MJD/SCA3. An increasing number of cases identified by genetic testing, including 
      cases with no apparent family history, accurately revealed the distribution of 
      disease types in Hokkaido.

LID - 2397
AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction has been described in many neurodegenerative disorders; 
      however, there is less information regarding mitochondrial deficits in 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), a polyglutamine (polyQ) disorder caused by CAG 
      repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. In the present study, we characterized the 
      changes in mitochondrial function and biogenesis markers in two MJD models, 
      CMVMJD135 (MJD135) transgenic mice at a fully established phenotype stage and 
      tetracycline-regulated PC6-3 Q108 cell line expressing mutant ataxin-3 (mATXN3). 
      We detected mATXN3 in the mitochondrial fractions of PC6-3 Q108 cells, suggesting 
      the interaction of expanded ATXN3 with the organelle. Interestingly, in both the 
      cerebella of the MJD135 mouse model and in PC6-3 Q108 cells, we found decreased 
      mitochondrial respiration, ATP production and mitochondrial membrane potential, 
      strongly suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction in MJD. Also, in PC6-3 Q108 cells, 
      an additional enhanced glycolytic flux was observed. Supporting the functional 
      deficits observed in MJD mitochondria, MJD135 mouse cerebellum and PC6-3 Q108 
      cells showed reduced cytochrome c mRNA and protein levels. Overall, our findings 
      show compromised mitochondrial function associated with decreased cytochrome c 
      levels in both cell and animal models of MJD.

AB  - Expansions of repeat DNA tracts cause >70 diseases, and ongoing expansions in 
      brains exacerbate disease. During expansion mutations, single-stranded DNAs 
      (ssDNAs) form slipped-DNAs. We find the ssDNA-binding complexes canonical 
      replication protein A (RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3) and Alternative-RPA (RPA1, RPA3, and 
      primate-specific RPA4) are upregulated in Huntington disease and spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 1 (SCA1) patient brains. Protein interactomes of RPA and Alt-RPA 
      reveal unique and shared partners, including modifiers of CAG instability and 
      disease presentation. RPA enhances in vitro melting, FAN1 excision, and repair of 
      slipped-CAGs and protects against CAG expansions in human cells. RPA 
      overexpression in SCA1 mouse brains ablates expansions, coincident with decreased 
      ATXN1 aggregation, reduced brain DNA damage, improved neuron morphology, and 
      rescued motor phenotypes. In contrast, Alt-RPA inhibits melting, FAN1 excision, 
      and repair of slipped-CAGs and promotes CAG expansions. These findings suggest a 
      functional interplay between the two RPAs where Alt-RPA may antagonistically 
      offset RPA's suppression of disease-associated repeat expansions, which may 
      extend to other DNA processes.

TI  - Development of an isogenic human cell trio that models polyglutamine disease.
PG  - 179-189
LID - 10.1266/ggs.22-00030 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are rare autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative 
      diseases associated with the expansion of glutamine-encoding triplet repeats in 
      certain genes. To investigate the functional influence of repeat expansion on 
      disease mechanisms, we applied a biallelic genome-engineering platform that we 
      recently established, called Universal Knock-in System or UKiS, to develop a 
      human cell trio, a set of three isogenic cell lines that are homozygous for two 
      different numbers of repeats (first and second lines) or heterozygous for the two 
      repeat numbers (third line). As an example of a polyQ disease, we chose 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). In a pseudodiploid human cell line, both 
      alleles of the glutamine-encoding triplet repeat in the SCA2-causing gene, ataxin 
      2 or ATXN2, were first knocked in with a donor sequence encoding both thymidine 
      kinase and either puromycin or blasticidin resistance proteins under dual drug 
      selection. The knocked-in donor alleles were then substituted with a payload 
      having either 22 or 76 triplet repeats in ATXN2 by ganciclovir negative 
      selection. The two-step substitution and subsequent SNP typing and genomic 
      sequencing confirmed that the SCA2-modeling isogenic cell trio was obtained: 
      three clones of 22-repeat homozygotes, two clones of 22/76-repeat heterozygotes 
      and two clones of 76-repeat homozygotes. Finally, RT-PCR and immunoblotting using 
      the obtained clones showed that, consistent with previous observations, glutamine 
      tract expansion reduced transcriptional and translational expression of ATXN2. 
      The cell clones with homozygous long-repeat alleles, which are rarely obtained 
      from patients with SCA2, showed more drastic reduction of ATXN2 expression than 
      the heterozygous clones. This study thus demonstrates the potential of UKiS, 
      which is a beneficial platform for the efficient development of cell models not 
      only for polyQ diseases but also for any other genetic diseases, which may 
      accelerate our deeper understanding of disease mechanisms and cell-based 
      screening for therapeutic drugs.

TI  - Repeat expansions in NOP56 are a cause of spinocerebellar ataxia Type 36 in the 
      British population.
PG  - fcad244
LID - 10.1093/braincomms/fcad244 [doi]
LID - fcad244
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias form a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia. Their 
      prevalence varies among populations and ethnicities. Spinocerebellar ataxia 36 is 
      caused by a GGCCTG repeat expansion in the first intron of the NOP56 gene and is 
      characterized by late-onset ataxia, sensorineural hearing loss and upper and 
      lower motor neuron signs, including tongue fasciculations. Spinocerebellar ataxia 
      36 has been described mainly in East Asian and Western European patients and was 
      thought to be absent in the British population. Leveraging novel bioinformatic 
      tools to detect repeat expansions from whole-genome sequencing, we analyse the 
      NOP56 repeat in 1257 British patients with hereditary ataxia and in 7506 
      unrelated controls. We identify pathogenic repeat expansions in five families 
      (seven patients), representing the first cohort of White British descent patients 
      with spinocerebellar ataxia 36. Employing in silico approaches using whole-genome 
      sequencing data, we found an 87 kb shared haplotype in among the affected 
      individuals from five families around the NOP56 repeat region, although this 
      block was also shared between several controls, suggesting that the repeat arises 
      on a permissive haplotype. Clinically, the patients presented with slowly 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia with a low rate of hearing loss and variable rates 
      of motor neuron impairment. Our findings show that the NOP56 expansion causes 
      ataxia in the British population and that spinocerebellar ataxia 36 can be 
      suspected in patients with a late-onset, slowly progressive ataxia, even without 
      the findings of hearing loss and tongue fasciculation.

TI  - Widespread alternative splicing dysregulation occurs presymptomatically in CAG 
      expansion spinocerebellar ataxias.

AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative diseases, several of which are caused by CAG expansion 
      mutations (SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 12) and more broadly belong to the large family 
      of over 40 microsatellite expansion diseases. While dysregulation of alternative 
      splicing is a well-defined driver of disease pathogenesis across several 
      microsatellite diseases, the contribution of alternative splicing in CAG 
      expansion SCAs is poorly understood. Furthermore, despite extensive studies on 
      differential gene expression there remains a gap in our understanding of 
      presymptomatic transcriptomic drivers of disease. We sought to address these 
      knowledge gaps through a comprehensive study of 29 publicly available 
      RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) datasets. We identified that dysregulation of 
      alternative splicing is widespread across CAG expansion mouse models of SCAs 1, 3 
      and 7. These changes were detected presymptomatically, persisted throughout 
      disease progression, were repeat length dependent, and were present in brain 
      regions implicated in SCA pathogenesis including the cerebellum, pons, and 
      medulla. Across disease progression, changes in alternative splicing occurred in 
      genes that function in pathways and processes known to be impaired in SCAs, such 
      as ion channels, synaptic signalling, transcriptional regulation, and the 
      cytoskeleton. We validated several key alternative splicing events with known 
      functional consequences, including Trpc3 exon 9 and Kcnma1 exon 23b, in the 
      Atxn1154Q/2Q mouse model. Finally, we demonstrated that alternative splicing 
      dysregulation is responsive to therapeutic intervention in CAG expansion SCAs 
      with Atxn1 targeting antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) rescuing key splicing 
      events. Taken together, these data demonstrate that widespread presymptomatic 
      dysregulation of alternative splicing in CAG expansion SCAs may contribute to 
      disease onset, early neuronal dysfunction and may represent novel biomarkers 
      across this devastating group of neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - Frequency and phenotypic spectrum of spinocerebellar ataxia 27B and other genetic

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dominantly inherited GAA repeat expansions in the 
      fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) gene have recently been shown to cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 27B (SCA27B). We aimed to study the frequency and 
      phenotype of SCA27B in a cohort of patients with unsolved late-onset cerebellar 
      ataxia (LOCA). We also assessed the frequency of SCA27B relative to other 
      genetically defined LOCAs. METHODS: We recruited a consecutive series of 107 
      patients with LOCA, of whom 64 remained genetically undiagnosed. We screened 
      these 64 patients for the FGF14 GAA repeat expansion. We next analysed the 
      frequency of SCA27B relative to other genetically defined forms of LOCA in the 
      cohort of 107 patients. RESULTS: Eighteen of 64 patients (28%) carried an FGF14 
      (GAA)(>/=250) expansion. The median (range) age at onset was 62.5 (39-72) years. 
      The most common clinical features included gait ataxia (100%) and mild cerebellar 
      dysarthria (67%). In addition, episodic symptoms and downbeat nystagmus were 
      present in 39% (7/18) and 37% (6/16) of patients, respectively. SCA27B was the 
      most common cause of LOCA in our cohort (17%, 18/107). Among patients with 
      genetically defined LOCA, SCA27B was the main cause of pure ataxia, RFC1-related 
      disease of ataxia with neuropathy, and SPG7 of ataxia with spasticity. 
      CONCLUSION: We showed that SCA27B is the most common cause of LOCA in our cohort. 
      Our results support the use of FGF14 GAA repeat expansion screening as a 
      first-tier genetic test in patients with LOCA.

AB  - With complicated conditions and a large number of potentially causative genes, 
      the diagnosis of a patient with complex inherited peripheral neuropathies (IPNs) 
      is challenging. To provide an overview of the genetic and clinical features of 39 
      families with complex IPNs from central south China and to optimize the molecular 
      diagnosis approach to this group of heterogeneous diseases, a total of 39 index 
      patients from unrelated families were enrolled, and detailed clinical data were 
      collected. TTR Sanger sequencing, hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) gene panel, 
      and dynamic mutation detection in spinocerebellar ataxia (SCAs) were performed 
      according to the respective additional clinical features. Whole-exome sequencing 
      (WES) was used in patients with negative or unclear results. Dynamic mutation 
      detection in NOTCH2NLC and RCF1 was applied as a supplement to WES. As a result, 
      an overall molecular diagnosis rate of 89.7% was achieved. All 21 patients with 
      predominant autonomic dysfunction and multiple organ system involvement carried 
      pathogenic variants in TTR, among which nine had c.349G > T (p.A97S) hotspot 
      variants. Five out of 7 patients (71.4%) with muscle involvement harbored 
      biallelic pathogenic variants in GNE. Five out of 6 patients (83.3%) with 
      spasticity reached definite genetic causes in SACS, KIF5A, BSCL2, and KIAA0196, 
      respectively. NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions were identified in all three cases 
      accompanied by chronic coughing and in one patient accompanied by cognitive 
      impairment. The pathogenic variants, p.F284S and p.G111R in GNE, and p.K4326E in 
      SACS, were first reported. In conclusion, transthyretin amyloidosis with 
      polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN), GNE myopathy, and neuronal intranuclear inclusion 
      disease (NIID) were the most common genotypes in this cohort of complex IPNs. 
      NOTCH2NLC dynamic mutation testing should be added to the molecular diagnostic 
      workflow. We expanded the genetic and related clinical spectrum of GNE myopathy 
      and ARSACS by reporting novel variants.

TI  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia 36 is a Frequent Cause of Hereditary Ataxia in Eastern 
      Spain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36) is caused by 
      hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the NOP56 gene. OBJECTIVES: To assess 
      frequency, clinical and genetic features of SCA36 in Eastern Spain. METHODS: 
      NOP56 expansion was tested in a cohort of undiagnosed cerebellar ataxia families 
      (n = 84). Clinical characterization and haplotype studies were performed. 
      RESULTS: SCA36 was identified in 37 individuals from 16 unrelated families. It 
      represented 5.4% of hereditary ataxia patients. The majority were originally from 
      the same region and displayed a shared haplotype. Mean age at onset was 
      52.5 years. Non-ataxic features included: hypoacusis (67.9%), pyramidal signs 
      (46.4%), lingual fasciculations/atrophy (25%), dystonia (17.8%), and parkinsonism 
      with evidence of dopaminergic denervation (10.7%). CONCLUSIONS: SCA36 is a 
      frequent cause of hereditary ataxia in Eastern Spain, and is associated with a 
      strong founder effect. SCA36 analysis should be considered prior to other 
      studies, especially in AD presentations. Parkinsonism reported here broadens 
      SCA36 clinical spectrum.

AB  - Dominantly inherited GAA repeat expansions in FGF14 are a common cause of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (GAA-FGF14 ataxia; spinocerebellar ataxia 27B). Molecular 
      confirmation of FGF14 GAA repeat expansions has thus far mostly relied on 
      long-read sequencing, a technology that is not yet widely available in clinical 
      laboratories. We developed and validated a strategy to detect FGF14 GAA repeat 
      expansions using long-range PCR, bidirectional repeat-primed PCRs, and Sanger 
      sequencing. We compared this strategy to targeted nanopore sequencing in a cohort 
      of 22 French Canadian patients and next validated it in a cohort of 53 French 
      index patients with unsolved ataxia. Method comparison showed that capillary 
      electrophoresis of long-range PCR amplification products significantly 
      underestimated expansion sizes compared to nanopore sequencing (slope, 0.87 [95% 
      CI, 0.81 to 0.93]; intercept, 14.58 [95% CI, - 2.48 to 31.12]) and gel 
      electrophoresis (slope, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.78 to 0.97]; intercept, 21.34 [95% CI, 
      - 27.66 to 40.22]). The latter techniques yielded similar size estimates. 
      Following calibration with internal controls, expansion size estimates were 
      similar between capillary electrophoresis and nanopore sequencing (slope: 0.98 
      [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.04]; intercept: 10.62 [95% CI, - 7.49 to 27.71]), and gel 
      electrophoresis (slope: 0.94 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.09]; intercept: 18.81 [95% CI, 
      - 41.93 to 39.15]). Diagnosis was accurately confirmed for all 22 French Canadian 
      patients using this strategy. We also identified 9 French patients (9/53; 17%) 
      and 2 of their relatives who carried an FGF14 (GAA)(>/=250) expansion. This novel 
      strategy reliably detected and sized FGF14 GAA expansions, and compared favorably 
      to long-read sequencing.

AB  - Although the best-known spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are triplet repeat 
      diseases, many SCAs are not caused by repeat expansions. The rarity of individual 
      non-expansion SCAs, however, has made it difficult to discern genotype-phenotype 
      correlations. We therefore screened individuals who had been found to bear 
      variants in a non-expansion SCA-associated gene through genetic testing, and 
      after we eliminated genetic groups that had fewer than 30 subjects, there were 
      756 subjects bearing single-nucleotide variants or deletions in one of seven 
      genes: CACNA1A (239 subjects), PRKCG (175), AFG3L2 (101), ITPR1 (91), STUB1 (77), 
      SPTBN2 (39), or KCNC3 (34). We compared age at onset, disease features, and 
      progression by gene and variant. There were no features that reliably 
      distinguished one of these SCAs from another, and several genes-CACNA1A, ITPR1, 
      SPTBN2, and KCNC3-were associated with both adult-onset and infantile-onset forms 
      of disease, which also differed in presentation. Nevertheless, progression was 
      overall very slow, and STUB1-associated disease was the fastest. Several variants 
      in CACNA1A showed particularly wide ranges in age at onset: one variant produced 
      anything from infantile developmental delay to ataxia onset at 64 years of age 
      within the same family. For CACNA1A, ITPR1, and SPTBN2, the type of variant and 
      charge change on the protein greatly affected the phenotype, defying 
      pathogenicity prediction algorithms. Even with next-generation sequencing, 
      accurate diagnosis requires dialogue between the clinician and the geneticist.

PG  - 310-313
LID - 10.5603/PJNNS.a2023.0037 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We present the first two Polish families diagnosed with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) and draw attention to cardiac involvement as 
      a new potential manifestation of this disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two 
      well-documented kindreds are presented. RESULTS: The proband from Family 1 
      presented aged 54 years with vision worsening followed by progressive imbalance. 
      Brain MRI demonstrated cerebellar atrophy. Genetic testing confirmed CAG repeat 
      expansion (42/10) in ATXN7 gene. The proband from Family 2 developed imbalance at 
      age 20, followed by progressive deterioration of vision. Brain MRI revealed 
      cerebellar atrophy. Additionally, she developed chronic congestive heart failure 
      and, at age 38, had cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20% and 
      significant mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Genetic analysis found abnormal 
      CAG expansion in the ATXN7 (46/10). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Vision 
      loss due to pigmentary retinal degeneration is the distinguishing feature of SCA7 
      and often the initial manifestation. Although SCA7 is one of the most common SCAs 
      in Sweden, it has never been reported in neighbouring Poland. Until now, cardiac 
      abnormalities have only been described in infantile-onset SCA7 with large CAG 
      repeats. The observed cardiac involvement in Family 2 may be coincidental, albeit 
      a new possible manifestation of SCA7 cannot be excluded.

TI  - GAA-FGF14 ataxia (SCA27B): phenotypic profile, natural history progression and 
      4-aminopyridine treatment response.
PG  - 4144-4157
LID - 10.1093/brain/awad157 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia due to an autosomal dominant intronic GAA repeat expansion in FGF14 
      [GAA-FGF14 ataxia, spinocerebellar ataxia 27B (SCA27B)] has recently been 
      identified as one of the most common genetic late-onset ataxias. We here aimed to 
      characterize its phenotypic profile, natural history progression, and 
      4-aminopyridine (4-AP) treatment response. We conducted a multi-modal cohort 
      study of 50 GAA-FGF14 patients, comprising in-depth phenotyping, cross-sectional 
      and longitudinal progression data (up to 7 years), MRI findings, serum 
      neurofilament light (sNfL) levels, neuropathology, and 4-AP treatment response 
      data, including a series of n-of-1 treatment studies. GAA-FGF14 ataxia 
      consistently presented as late-onset [60.0 years (53.5-68.5), median 
      (interquartile range)] pancerebellar syndrome, partly combined with afferent 
      sensory deficits (55%) and dysautonomia (28%). Dysautonomia increased with 
      duration while cognitive impairment remained infrequent, even in advanced stages. 
      Cross-sectional and longitudinal assessments consistently indicated mild 
      progression of ataxia [0.29 Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) 
      points/year], not exceeding a moderate disease severity even in advanced stages 
      (maximum SARA score: 18 points). Functional impairment increased relatively 
      slowly (unilateral mobility aids after 8 years in 50% of patients). Corresponding 
      to slow progression and low extra-cerebellar involvement, sNfL was not increased 
      relative to controls. Concurrent second diseases (including progressive 
      supranuclear palsy neuropathology) represented major individual aggravators of 
      disease severity, constituting important caveats for planning future GAA-FGF14 
      trials. A treatment response to 4-AP with relevance for everyday living was 
      reported by 86% of treated patients. A series of three prospective n-of-1 
      treatment experiences with on/off design showed marked reduction in daily 
      symptomatic time and symptom severity on 4-AP. Our study characterizes the 
      phenotypic profile, natural history progression, and 4-AP treatment response of 
      GAA-FGF14 ataxia. It paves the way towards large-scale natural history studies 
      and 4-AP treatment trials in this newly discovered, possibly most frequent, and 
      treatable late-onset ataxia.

TI  - CAG Repeat Expansion in THAP11 Is Associated with a Novel Spinocerebellar Ataxia.
PG  - 1282-1293
LID - 10.1002/mds.29412 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: More than 50 loci are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), 
      and the most frequent subtypes share nucleotide repeats expansion, especially CAG 
      expansion. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to confirm a novel SCA 
      subtype caused by CAG expansion. METHODS: We performed long-read whole-genome 
      sequencing combined with linkage analysis in a five-generation Chinese family, 
      and the finding was validated in another pedigree. The three-dimensional 
      structure and function of THAP11 mutant protein were predicted. Polyglutamine 
      (polyQ) toxicity of THAP11 gene with CAG expansion was assessed in skin 
      fibroblasts of patients, human embryonic kidney 293 and Neuro-2a cells. RESULTS: 
      We identified THAP11 as the novel causative SCA gene with CAG repeats ranging 
      from 45 to 100 in patients with ataxia and from 20 to 38 in healthy control 
      subjects. Among the patients, the number of CAA interruptions within CAG repeats 
      was decreased to 3 (up to 5-6 in controls), whereas the number of 3' pure CAG 
      repeats was up to 32 to 87 (4-16 in controls), suggesting that the toxicity of 
      polyQ protein was length dependent on the pure CAG repeats. Intracellular 
      aggregates were observed in cultured skin fibroblasts from patients. THAP11 polyQ 
      protein was more intensely distributed in the cytoplasm of cultured skin 
      fibroblasts from patients, which was replicated with in vitro cultured neuro-2a 
      transfected with 54 or 100 CAG repeats. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a 
      novel SCA subtype caused by intragenic CAG repeat expansion in THAP11 with 
      intracellular aggregation of THAP11 polyQ protein. Our findings extended the 
      spectrum of polyQ diseases and offered a new perspective in understanding 
      polyQ-mediated toxic aggregation. (c) 2023 The Authors. Movement Disorders

AB  - Pathogenic short tandem repeat (STR) expansions cause over 20 neurodegenerative 
      diseases. To determine the contribution of STRs in sporadic amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), we used ExpansionHunter, 
      REviewer, and polymerase chain reaction validation to assess 21 neurodegenerative 
      disease-associated STRs in whole-genome sequencing data from 608 patients with 
      sporadic ALS, 68 patients with sporadic FTD, and 4703 matched controls. We also 
      propose a data-derived outlier detection method for defining allele thresholds in 
      rare STRs. Excluding C9orf72 repeat expansions, 17.6% of clinically diagnosed ALS 
      and FTD cases had at least one expanded STR allele reported to be pathogenic or 
      intermediate for another neurodegenerative disease. We identified and validated 
      162 disease-relevant STR expansions in C9orf72 (ALS/FTD), ATXN1 [spinal 
      cerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1)], ATXN2 (SCA2), ATXN8 (SCA8), TBP (SCA17), HTT 
      (Huntington's disease), DMPK [myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)], CNBP (DM2), and 
      FMR1 (fragile-X disorders). Our findings suggest clinical and pathological 
      pleiotropy of neurodegenerative disease genes and highlight their importance in 
      ALS and FTD.

AB  - Introduction: Spinocerebellar ataxias 36 (SCA36) is the neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by the GGCCTG Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in NOP56, which is too long 
      to sequence using short-read sequencing. Single molecule real time (SMRT) 
      sequencing can sequence across disease-causing repeat expansion. We report the 
      first long-read sequencing data across the expansion region in SCA36. Methods: We 
      collected and described the clinical manifestations and imaging features of Han 
      Chinese pedigree with three generations of SCA36. Also, we focused on structural 
      variation analysis for intron 1 of the NOP56 gene by SMRT sequencing in the 
      assembled genome. Results: The main clinical features of this pedigree are 
      late-onset ataxia symptoms, with a presymptomatic presence of affective and sleep 
      disorders. In addition, the results of SMRT sequencing showed the specific repeat 
      expansion region and demonstrated that the region was not composed of single 
      GGCCTG hexanucleotides and there were random interruptions. Discussion: We 
      extended the phenotypic spectrum of SCA36. We applied SMRT sequencing to reveal

AB  - In recent years, a large group of familial epilepsies and hereditary ataxias have 
      emerged, caused by an extraordinary type of a novel pentanucleotide repeat 
      expansion that has arisen in a preexisting nonpathogenic repeat tract. 
      Remarkably, these insertions have occurred in noncoding regions of genes 
      expressed in the cerebellum, but with highly diverse functions. These conditions, 
      clinically very heterogeneous, may remain underdiagnosed in patients with 
      atypical phenotypes and age at onset. They share, however, many genetic and 
      phenotypic features, and discovery or detection of their pathogenic 
      pentanucleotide repeats for diagnostic purposes can be achieved using recent 
      bioinformatic methods. Here, we focus on the latest advances regarding the 
      peculiar group of pentanucleotide repeat-related disorders beyond epilepsies.

TI  - TR-FRET-Based Immunoassay to Measure Ataxin-2 as a Target Engagement Marker in 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2.
PG  - 3553-3567
LID - 10.1007/s12035-023-03294-y [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative disease, which belongs to the trinucleotide repeat disease 
      group with a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the ATXN2 gene resulting in an 
      ataxin-2 protein with an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ)-stretch. The disease is 
      late manifesting leading to early death. Today, therapeutic interventions to cure 
      the disease or even to decelerate disease progression are not available yet. 
      Furthermore, primary readout parameter for disease progression and therapeutic 
      intervention studies are limited. Thus, there is an urgent need for quantifiable 
      molecular biomarkers such as ataxin-2 becoming even more important due to 
      numerous potential protein-lowering therapeutic intervention strategies. The aim 
      of this study was to establish a sensitive technique to measure the amount of 
      soluble polyQ-expanded ataxin-2 in human biofluids to evaluate ataxin-2 protein 
      levels as prognostic and/or therapeutic biomarker in SCA2. Time-resolved 
      fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) was used to establish a polyQ-expanded 
      ataxin-2-specific immunoassay. Two different ataxin-2 antibodies and two 
      different polyQ-binding antibodies were validated in three different 
      concentrations and tested in cellular and animal tissue as well as in human cell 
      lines, comparing different buffer conditions to evaluate the best assay 
      conditions. We established a TR-FRET-based immunoassay for soluble polyQ-expanded 
      ataxin-2 and validated measurements in human cell lines including iPSC-derived 
      cortical neurons. Additionally, our immunoassay was sensitive enough to monitor 
      small ataxin-2 expression changes by siRNA or starvation treatment. We 
      successfully established the first sensitive ataxin-2 immunoassay to measure 
      specifically soluble polyQ-expanded ataxin-2 in human biomaterials.

TI  - Neuropathology of spinocerebellar ataxia type 8: Common features and unique 
      tauopathy.
PG  - 351-361
LID - 10.1111/neup.12894 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a neurodegenerative condition that 
      presents with several neurological symptoms, such as cerebellar ataxia, 
      parkinsonism, and cognitive impairment. It is caused by a CTA/CTG repeat 
      expansion on chromosome 13q21 (ataxin 8 opposite strand [ATXN8OS]). However, the 
      pathological significance of this expansion remains unclear. Moreover, abnormal 
      CTA/CTG repeat expansions in ATXN8OS have also been reported in other 
      neurodegenerative diseases, including progressive supranuclear palsy. In this 
      study, we analyzed all available autopsy cases in Japan to investigate common 
      pathological features and profiles of tau pathology in each case. Severe neuronal 
      loss in the substantia nigra and prominent loss of Purkinje cells, atrophy of the 
      molecular layer, and proliferation of Bergmann glia in the cerebellum were common 
      features. Regarding tauopathy, one case presented with progressive supranuclear 
      palsy-like 4-repeat tauopathy in addition to mild Alzheimer-type 3- and 4-repeat 
      tauopathy. Another case showed 3- and 4-repeat tauopathy accentuated in the 
      brainstem. The other two cases lacked tauopathy after extensive 
      immunohistochemical studies. The present study confirmed common pathological 
      features of SCA8 as degeneration of the substantia nigra in addition to the 
      cerebellum. Our study also confirmed unique tauopathy in two of four cases, 
      indicating the necessity to further collect autopsy cases.

AB  - CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions cause several neurodegenerative diseases, 
      including Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia. RNAs with expanded CAG 
      repeats contribute to disease in two unusual ways. First, these repeat-containing 
      RNAs may agglomerate in the nucleus as foci that sequester several RNA-binding 
      proteins. Second, these RNAs may undergo aberrant repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) 
      translation in multiple frames and produce aggregation-prone proteins. The 
      relationship between RAN translation and RNA foci, and their relative 
      contributions to cellular dysfunction, are unclear. Here, we show that CAG 
      repeat-containing RNAs that undergo RAN translation first accumulate at nuclear 
      foci and, over time, are exported to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, these RNAs 
      are initially dispersed but, upon RAN translation, aggregate with the RAN 
      translation products. These RNA-RAN protein agglomerates sequester various 
      RNA-binding proteins and are associated with the disruption of nucleocytoplasmic 
      transport and cell death. In contrast, RNA accumulation at nuclear foci alone 
      does not produce discernable defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport or cell 
      viability. Inhibition of RAN translation prevents cytoplasmic RNA aggregation and 
      alleviates cell toxicity. Our findings demonstrate that RAN translation-induced 
      RNA-protein aggregation correlates with the key pathological hallmarks observed 
      in disease and suggest that cytoplasmic RNA aggregation may be an 
      underappreciated phenomenon in CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxias (CAs) represent a group of autosomal dominant and recessive 
      neurodegenerative disorders affecting cerebellum with or without spinal cord. 
      Overall, CAs have preponderance for tandem nucleotide repeat expansions as an 
      etiological factor (10 TREs explain nearly 30-40% of ataxia cohort globally). The 
      experience of 10 years of common genetic ataxia subtypes for  approximately 5600 patients' 
      referrals (Pan-India) received at a single center is shared herein. Frequencies 
      (in %, n) of SCA types and FRDA in the sample cohort are observed as follows: 
      SCA12 (8.6%, 490); SCA2 (8.5%, 482); SCA1 (4.8%, 272); SCA3 (2%, 113); SCA7 
      (0.5%, 28); SCA6 (0.1%, 05); SCA17 (0.1%, 05), and FRDA (2.2%, 127). A 
      significant amount of variability in TRE lengths at each locus is observed, we 
      noted presence of biallelic expansion, co-occurrence of SCA-subtypes, and the 
      presence of premutable normal alleles. The frequency of mutated GAA-FRDA allele 
      in healthy controls is 1/158 (0.63%), thus an expected FRDA prevalence of 1:100 
      000 persons. The data of this study are relevant not only for clinical decision 
      making but also for guidance in direction of genetic investigations, 
      transancestral comparison of genotypes, and lastly provide insight for policy 
      decision for the consideration of SCAs under rare disease category.

AB  - Usually, molecular diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia is based on a step-by-step 
      approach with targeted sizing of four repeat expansions accounting for most 
      dominant cases, then targeted sequencing of other genes. Nowadays, genome 
      sequencing allows detection of most pathogenic variants in a single step. The 
      ExpansionHunter tool can detect expansions in short-read genome sequencing data. 
      Recent studies have shown that ExpansionHunter can also be used to identify 
      repeat expansions in exome sequencing data. We tested ExpansionHunter on 
      spinocerebellar ataxia exomes in a research context as a second-line analysis, 
      after exclusion of main CAG repeat expansions in half of the probands. First, we 
      confirmed the detection of expansions in seven known expansion carriers and then, 
      after targeted analysis of ATXN1, 2, 3 and 7, CACNA1A, TBP, ATN1, NOP56, AR and 
      HTT in 498 exomes, we found 22 additional pathogenic expansions. Comparison with 
      capillary migration sizing in 247 individuals and confirmation of all expanded 
      alleles detected by ExpansionHunter demonstrated that for these loci, sensitivity 
      and specificity reached 100%. ExpansionHunter detected but underestimated the 
      repeat size for larger expansions, and the normal alleles distribution at each 
      locus should be taken into account to detect expansions. Exome combined with 
      ExpansionHunter is reliable to detect repeat expansions in selected loci as 
      first-line analysis in spinocerebellar ataxia.

TI  - Solution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Structures of ATTTT and ATTTC Pentanucleotide 
      Repeats Associated with SCA37 and FAMEs.
PG  - 289-299
LID - 10.1021/acschemneuro.2c00593 [doi]
AB  - Expansions of ATTTT and ATTTC pentanucleotide repeats in the human genome are 
      recently found to be associated with at least seven neurodegenerative diseases, 
      including spinocerebellar ataxia type 37 (SCA37) and familial adult myoclonic 
      epilepsy (FAME) types 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. The formation of non-B DNA structures 
      during some biological processes is thought as a causative factor for repeat 
      expansions. Yet, the structural basis for these pyrimidine-rich ATTTT and ATTTC 
      repeat expansions remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the solution 
      structures of ATTTT and ATTTC repeats using nuclear magnetic resonance 
      spectroscopy. Here, we reveal that ATTTT and ATTTC repeats can form a highly 
      compact minidumbbell structure at the 5'-end using their first two repeats. The 
      high-resolution structure of two ATTTT repeats was determined, showing a regular 
      TTTTA pentaloop and a quasi TTTT/A pentaloop. Furthermore, the minidumbbell 
      structure could escape from proofreading by the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase 
      I when it was located at five or more base pairs away from the priming site, 
      leading to a small-scale repeat expansion. Results of this work improve our 
      understanding of ATTTT and ATTTC repeat expansions in SCA37 and FAMEs, and 
      provide high-resolution structural information for rational drug design.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic efficacy of clinical 
      exome-targeted sequencing (CES) and spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36) screening 
      in a real-life cohort of patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) from Eastern Spain. 
      METHODS: A total of 130 unrelated patients with CA, negative for common 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, 
      SCA17, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA], and Friedreich ataxia), were 
      studied with CES. Bioinformatic and genotype-phenotype analyses were performed to 
      assess the pathogenicity of the variants encountered. Copy number variants were 
      analyzed when appropriate. In undiagnosed dominant and sporadic cases, repeat 
      primed PCR was used to screen for the presence of a repeat expansion in the NOP56 
      gene. RESULTS: CES identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 50 
      families (39%), including 23 novel variants. Overall, there was a high genetic 
      heterogeneity, and the most frequent genetic diagnosis was SPG7 (n = 15), 
      followed by SETX (n = 6), CACNA1A (n = 5), POLR3A (n = 4), and SYNE1 (n = 3). In 
      addition, 17 families displayed likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants in 14 
      different genes: KCND3 (n = 2), KIF1C (n = 2), CYP27A1A (n = 2), AFG3L2 (n = 1), 
      ANO10 (n = 1), CAPN1 (n = 1), CWF19L1 (n = 1), ITPR1 (n = 1), KCNA1 (n = 1), OPA1 
      (n = 1), PNPLA6 (n = 1), SPG11 (n = 1), SPTBN2 (n = 1), and TPP1 (n = 1). 
      Twenty-two novel variants were characterized. SCA36 was diagnosed in 11 families, 
      all with autosomal dominant (AD) presentation. SCA36 screening increased the 
      total diagnostic rate to 47% (n = 61/130). Ultimately, undiagnosed patients 
      showed delayed age at onset (p < 0.05) and were more frequently sporadic. 
      DISCUSSION: Our study provides insight into the genetic landscape of CA in 
      Eastern Spain. Although CES was an effective approach to capture genetic 
      heterogeneity, most patients remained undiagnosed. SCA36 was found to be a 
      relatively frequent form and, therefore, should be tested prior to CES in 
      familial AD presentations in particular geographical regions.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17-digenic TBP/STUB1 disease: neuropathologic 
      features of an autopsied patient.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 17-digenic TBP/STUB1 disease (SCA17-DI) has 
      been recently segregated from SCA17, caused by digenic inheritance of two gene 
      mutations - intermediate polyglutamine-encoding CAG/CAA repeat expansions (polyQ) 
      in TBP (TBP(41 - 49)) and STUB1 heterozygosity - the former being associated with 
      SCA17, and the latter with SCA48 and SCAR16 (autosomal recessive). In SCA17, most 
      patients carry intermediate TBP(41 - 49) alleles but show incomplete penetrance, 
      and the missing heritability can be explained by a new entity whereby 
      TBP(41 - 49) requires the STUB1 variant to be symptomatic. The STUB1 gene encodes 
      the chaperone-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase (CHIP) involved in 
      ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal control of protein homeostasis. However, reports 
      of the neuropathology are limited and role of STUB1 mutations in SCA17-DI remain 
      unknown. Here we report the clinicopathologic features of identical twin 
      siblings, one of whom was autopsied and was found to carry an intermediate allele 
      (41 and 38 CAG/CAA repeats) in TBP and a heterozygous missense mutation in STUB1 
      (p.P243L). These patients developed autosomal recessive Huntington's disease-like 
      symptoms. Brain MRI showed diffuse atrophy of the cerebellum and T2WI revealed 
      hyperintense lesions in the basal ganglia and periventricular deep white matter. 
      The brain histopathology of the patient shared features characteristic of SCA17, 
      such as degeneration of the cerebellar cortex and caudate nucleus, and presence 
      of 1C2-positive neurons. Here we show that mutant CHIP fails to generate the 
      polyubiquitin chain due to disrupted folding of the entire U box domain, thereby 
      affecting the E3 activity of CHIP. When encountering patients with cerebellar 
      ataxia, especially those with Huntington's disease-like symptoms, genetic testing 
      for STUB1 as well as TBP should be conducted for diagnosis of SCA17-DI, even in 
      cases of sporadic or autosomal recessive inheritance.

AB  - PURPOSE: CAG/CAA repeat expansions in TBP(>49) are responsible for 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 17 (SCA17). We previously detected 
      cosegregation of STUB1 variants causing SCA48 with intermediate alleles of TBP in 
      2 families. This cosegregation questions the existence of SCA48 as a monogenic 
      disease. METHODS: We systematically sequenced TBP repeats in 34 probands of 
      dominant ataxia families with STUB1 variants. In addition, we searched for 
      pathogenic STUB1 variants in probands with expanded alleles of TBP(>49) (n = 2) 
      or intermediate alleles of TBP(>/=40) (n = 47). RESULTS: STUB1 variants were found 
      in half of the TBP(40-49) cohort. Mirroring this finding, TBP(40-49) alleles were 
      detected in 40% of STUB1 probands. The longer the TBP repeat length, the more 
      likely the occurrence of cognitive impairment (P = .0129) and the faster the 
      disease progression until death (P = .0003). Importantly, 13 STUB1 probands 
      presenting with the full SCA48 clinical phenotype had normal TBP(37-39) alleles, 
      excluding digenic inheritance as the sole mode. CONCLUSION: We show that 
      intermediate TBP(40-49) alleles act as disease modifiers of SCA48 rather than a 
      STUB1/TBP digenic model. This distinction from what has been proposed before has 
      crucial consequences for genetic counseling in SCA48.

AB  - While astrocyte heterogeneity is an important feature of the healthy brain, less 
      is understood about spatiotemporal heterogeneity of astrocytes in brain disease. 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene Ataxin1 (ATXN1). We characterized 
      astrocytes across disease progression in the four clinically relevant brain 
      regions, cerebellum, brainstem, hippocampus, and motor cortex, of Atxn1(154Q/2Q) 
      mice, a knock-in mouse model of SCA1. We found brain region-specific changes in 
      astrocyte density and GFAP expression and area, early in the disease and prior to 
      neuronal loss. Expression of astrocytic core homeostatic genes was also altered 
      in a brain region-specific manner and correlated with neuronal activity, 
      indicating that astrocytes may compensate or exacerbate neuronal dysfunction. 
      Late in disease, expression of astrocytic homeostatic genes was reduced in all 
      four brain regions, indicating loss of astrocyte functions. We observed no 
      obvious correlation between spatiotemporal changes in microglia and 
      spatiotemporal astrocyte alterations, indicating a complex orchestration of glial 
      phenotypes in disease. These results support spatiotemporal diversity of glial 
      phenotypes as an important feature of the brain disease that may contribute to 
      SCA1 pathogenesis in a brain region and disease stage-specific manner.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by progressive motor and nonmotor deficits concomitant with 
      degenerative pathophysiological changes within the cerebellum. The cerebellum is 
      topographically organized into cerebello-cerebral circuits that create distinct 
      functional networks regulating movement, cognition, and affect. SCA3-associated 
      motor and nonmotor symptoms are possibly related not only to intracerebellar 
      changes but also to disruption of the connectivity within these 
      cerebello-cerebral circuits. However, to date, no comprehensive investigation of 
      cerebello-cerebral connectivity in SCA3 has been conducted. The present study 
      aimed to identify cerebello-cerebral functional connectivity alterations and 
      associations with downstream clinical phenotypes and upstream topographic markers 
      of cerebellar neurodegeneration in patients with SCA3. This study included 45 
      patients with SCA3 and 49 healthy controls. Voxel-based morphometry and 
      resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed to 
      characterize the cerebellar atrophy and to examine the cerebello-cerebral 
      functional connectivity patterns. Structural MRI confirmed widespread gray matter 
      atrophy in the motor and cognitive cerebellum of patients with SCA3. We found 
      reduced functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortical 
      networks, including the somatomotor, frontoparietal, and default networks; 
      however, increased connectivity was observed between the cerebellum and the 
      dorsal attention network. These abnormal patterns correlated with the CAG repeat 
      expansion and deficits in global cognition. Our results indicate the contribution 
      of cerebello-cerebral networks to the motor and cognitive impairments in patients 
      with SCA3 and reveal that such alterations occur in association with cerebellar 
      atrophy. These findings add important insights into our understanding of the role 
      of the cerebellum in SCA3.

LID - 10.1093/brain/awac377 [doi]
AB  - Instability of simple DNA repeats has been known as a common cause of hereditary 
      ataxias for over 20 years. Routine genetic diagnostics of these phenotypically 
      similar diseases still rely on an iterative workflow for quantification of repeat 
      units by PCR-based methods of limited precision. We established and validated 
      clinical nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing, an amplification-free method for 
      simultaneous analysis of 10 repeat loci associated with clinically overlapping 
      hereditary ataxias. The method combines target enrichment by CRISPR-Cas9, Oxford 
      Nanopore long-read sequencing and a bioinformatics pipeline using the tools 
      STRique and Megalodon for parallel detection of length, sequence, methylation and 
      composition of the repeat loci. Clinical nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing 
      allowed for the precise and parallel analysis of 10 repeat loci associated with 
      adult-onset ataxia and revealed additional parameter such as FMR1 promotor 
      methylation and repeat sequence required for diagnosis at the same time. Using 
      clinical nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing we analysed 100 clinical samples of 
      undiagnosed ataxia patients and identified causative repeat expansions in 28 
      patients. Parallel repeat analysis enabled a molecular diagnosis of ataxias 
      independent of preconceptions on the basis of clinical presentation. Biallelic 
      expansions within RFC1 were identified as the most frequent cause of ataxia. We 
      characterized the RFC1 repeat composition of all patients and identified a novel 
      repeat motif, AGGGG. Our results highlight the power of clinical nanopore 
      Cas9-targeted sequencing as a readily expandable workflow for the in-depth 
      analysis and diagnosis of phenotypically overlapping repeat expansion disorders.

TI  - Moyamoya associated with Turner syndrome in a patient with type 2 spinocerebellar 
      ataxia-Occam's razor or Hickam's dictum: a case report.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Turner syndrome (TS) is a rare condition associated with a completely 
      or partially missing X chromosome that affects 1 in 2500 girls. TS increases the 
      risk of autoimmune diseases, including Graves' disease (GD). Moyamoya disease is 
      a rare cerebral arteriopathy of unknown etiology characterized by progressive 
      bilateral stenosis of the internal carotid artery and its branches. Both TS and 
      GD have been associated with Moyamoya. Type 2 spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA2) is an 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia caused by a CAG repeat expansion in ATXN2. 
      We present the first case of Moyamoya syndrome in a patient with a previous 
      diagnosis of TS and GD who tested positive for SCA2 and had imaging findings 
      compatible with an overlap of SCA2 and Moyamoya. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old 
      woman presented with mild gait imbalance for 2 years. Her family history was 
      positive for type 2 spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA2). She had been diagnosed with 
      Turner Syndrome (45,X) and Graves disease three years before. Brain MRI revealed 
      bilateral frontal and parietal cystic encephalomalacia in watershed zones, 
      atrophy of pons, middle cerebellar peduncles and cerebellum. MR angiography 
      showed progressive stenosis of both internal carotid arteries with 
      lenticulostriate collaterals, suggestive of Moya-Moya disease. Molecular analysis 
      confirmed the diagnosis of SCA2. CONCLUSIONS: With increased availability of 
      tools for genetic diagnosis, physicians need to be aware of the possibility of a 
      single patient presenting two or more rare diseases. This report underscores the 
      modern dilemmas created by increasingly accurate imaging techniques and available 
      and extensive genetic testing.

TI  - Familial Cerebellar Ataxia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/Frontotemporal 
      Dementia with DAB1 and C9ORF72 Repeat Expansions: An 18-Year Study.
PG  - 2427-2439
LID - 10.1002/mds.29221 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coding and noncoding repeat expansions are an important cause of 
      neurodegenerative diseases. OBJECTIVE: This study determined the clinical and 
      genetic features of a large German family that has been followed for almost 2 
      decades with an autosomal dominantly inherited spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) and 
      independent co-occurrence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD). METHODS: We carried out clinical examinations and 
      telephone interviews, reviewed medical records, and performed magnetic resonance 
      imaging and positron emission tomography scans of all available family members. 
      Comprehensive genetic investigations included linkage analysis, short-read genome 
      sequencing, long-read sequencing, repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction, and 
      Southern blotting. RESULTS: The family comprises 118 members across seven 
      generations, 30 of whom were definitely and five possibly affected. In this 
      family, two different pathogenic mutations were found, a heterozygous repeat 
      expansion in C9ORF72 in four patients with ALS/FTD and a heterozygous repeat 
      expansion in DAB1 in at least nine patients with SCA, leading to a diagnosis of 
      DAB1-related ataxia (ATX-DAB1; SCA37). One patient was affected by ALS and SCA 
      and carried both repeat expansions. The repeat in DAB1 had the same configuration 
      but was larger than those previously described ([ATTTT]( approximately 75) [ATTTC]( approximately 40-100) 
      [ATTTT]( approximately 415) ). Clinical features in patients with SCA included spinocerebellar 
      symptoms, sometimes accompanied by additional ophthalmoplegia, vertical 
      nystagmus, tremor, sensory deficits, and dystonia. After several decades, some of 
      these patients suffered from cognitive decline and one from additional 
      nonprogressive lower motor neuron affection. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate genetic 
      and clinical findings during an 18-year period in a unique family carrying two 
      different pathogenic repeat expansions, providing novel insights into their 
      genotypic and phenotypic spectrums. (c) 2022 The Authors. Movement Disorders

TI  - Huntington's disease age at motor onset is modified by the tandem hexamer repeat 
      in TCERG1.
PG  - 53
LID - 10.1038/s41525-022-00317-w [doi]
LID - 53
AB  - Huntington's disease is caused by an expanded CAG tract in HTT. The length of the 
      CAG tract accounts for over half the variance in age at onset of disease, and is 
      influenced by other genetic factors, mostly implicating the DNA maintenance 
      machinery. We examined a single nucleotide variant, rs79727797, on chromosome 5 
      in the TCERG1 gene, previously reported to be associated with Huntington's 
      disease and a quasi-tandem repeat (QTR) hexamer in exon 4 of TCERG1 with a 
      central pure repeat. We developed a method for calling perfect and imperfect 
      repeats from exome-sequencing data, and tested association between the QTR in 
      TCERG1 and residual age at motor onset (after correcting for the effects of CAG 
      length in the HTT gene) in 610 individuals with Huntington's disease via 
      regression analysis. We found a significant association between age at onset and 
      the sum of the repeat lengths from both alleles of the QTR (p = 2.1 x 10(-9)), 
      with each added repeat hexamer reducing age at onset by one year (95% confidence 
      interval [0.7, 1.4]). This association explained that previously observed with 
      rs79727797. The association with age at onset in the genome-wide association 
      study is due to a QTR hexamer in TCERG1, translated to a glutamine/alanine tract 
      in the protein. We could not distinguish whether this was due to cis-effects of 
      the hexamer repeat on gene expression or of the encoded glutamine/alanine tract 
      in the protein. These results motivate further study of the mechanisms by which 
      TCERG1 modifies onset of HD.

TI  - The S-Factor, a New Measure of Disease Severity in Spinocerebellar Ataxia: 
      Findings and Implications.
PG  - 790-809
LID - 10.1007/s12311-022-01424-1 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are progressive neurodegenerative disorders, but 
      there is no metric that predicts disease severity over time. We hypothesized that 
      by developing a new metric, the Severity Factor (S-Factor) using immutable 
      disease parameters, it would be possible to capture disease severity independent 
      of clinical rating scales. Extracting data from the CRC-SCA and READISCA natural 
      history studies, we calculated the S-Factor for 438 participants with symptomatic 
      SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6, as follows: ((length of CAG repeat expansion - maximum 
      normal repeat length) /maximum normal repeat length) x (current age - age at 
      disease onset) x 10). Within each SCA type, the S-Factor at the first Scale for 
      the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) visit (baseline) was correlated 
      against scores on SARA and other motor and cognitive assessments. In 281 
      participants with longitudinal data, the slope of the S-Factor over time was 
      correlated against slopes of scores on SARA and other motor rating scales. At 
      baseline, the S-Factor showed moderate-to-strong correlations with SARA and other 
      motor rating scales at the group level, but not with cognitive performance. 
      Longitudinally the S-Factor slope showed no consistent association with the slope 
      of performance on motor scales. Approximately 30% of SARA slopes reflected a 
      trend of non-progression in motor symptoms. The S-Factor is an 
      observer-independent metric of disease burden in SCAs. It may be useful at the 
      group level to compare cohorts at baseline in clinical studies. Derivation and 
      examination of the S-factor highlighted challenges in the use of clinical rating 
      scales in this population.

AB  - The most common autosomal dominant ataxia worldwide, spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3 (SCA3) is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. Here we report the generation 
      of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line UM134-1, the first SCA3 disease-specific 
      hESC line to be added to the NIH hESC registry. UM134-1 pluripotency was 
      confirmed by immunocytochemistry and PCR for pluripotency markers and by the 
      ability to form three germ layers in vitro. The established hESC line provides a 
      useful new human cell model to study the pathogenesis of SCA3.

AB  - Defects in ataxin-3 proteins and CAG repeat expansions in its coding gene ATXN3 
      cause Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3) or Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) 
      polyglutamine neurodegenerative disease. The mutant proteins aggregate as 
      inclusion bodies in cells and compete with wild-type ataxin-3, which leads to 
      neuronal dysfunction or death and impairs Beclin1-mediated autophagy. It has been 
      reported that Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can reliably treat several 
      neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we used a Transcription Factor EB (TFEB) 
      nuclear translocation-mediated MSCs co-culture approach to reconstitute autophagy 
      and lysosomal biogenesis, and reduce SCA3-like behaviors in induced pluripotent 
      stem cells (iPSCs)-derived neuron cells models. Our iPSCs model showed enhanced 
      expression of autophagy proteins, attenuated the expression and toxic effects of 
      mutant ataxin-3 on neurons, and alleviated the effects of ataxin-3 on autophagy. 
      Therefore, MSCs are associated with autophagy-inducing therapy and compared to 
      animal models, our MSCs co-culture could be used as a novel and potential 
      therapeutic approach to study SCA3 disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, including spinocerebellar ataxias and 
      Huntington's disease, are progressive neurodegenerative disorders caused by CAG 
      triplet-repeat expansion in the coding regions of disease-associated genes. In 
      this study, we found that neurotoxic small CAG (sCAG) RNA species, microscopic 
      Ataxin-2 CAG RNA foci, and protein aggregates exist as independent entities in 
      cells. Synaptic defects and neurite outgrowth abnormalities were observed in 
      mutant Ataxin-2-expressing mouse primary cortical neurons. We examined the 
      suppression effects of the CAG RNA-binding peptide beta-structured inhibitor for 
      neurodegenerative diseases (BIND) in mutant Ataxin-2-expressing mouse primary 
      cortical neurons and found that both impaired synaptic phenotypes and neurite 
      outgrowth defects were rescued. We further demonstrated that BIND rescued cell 
      death through inhibiting sCAG RNA production, Ataxin-2 CAG RNA foci formation, 
      and mutant Ataxin-2 protein translation. Interestingly, when the expanded CAG 
      repeats in the mutant Ataxin-2 transcript was interrupted with the alternative 
      glutamine codon CAA, BIND's inhibitory effect on mutant protein aggregation was 
      lost. We previously demonstrated that BIND interacts physically and directly with 
      expanded CAG RNA sequences. Our data provide evidence that the BIND peptide 
      associates with transcribed mutant CAG RNA to inhibit the formation of toxic 
      species, including sCAG RNA, RNA foci, and polyQ protein translation and 
      aggregation.

AB  - CAG repeat expansions in the ATXN2 (ataxin-2) gene can cause the autosomal 
      dominant disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) as well as increase the 
      risk of ALS. Abnormal molecular, motor, and neurophysiological phenotypes in SCA2 
      mouse models are normalized by lowering ATXN2 transcription, and reduction of 
      nonmutant Atxn2 expression has been shown to increase the life span of mice 
      overexpressing the TDP-43 (transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa) ALS 
      protein, demonstrating the potential benefits of targeting ATXN2 transcription in 
      humans. Here, we describe a quantitative high-throughput screen to identify 
      compounds that lower ATXN2 transcription. We screened 428,759 compounds in a 
      multiplexed assay using an ATXN2-luciferase reporter in human embryonic kidney 
      293 (HEK-293) cells and identified a diverse set of compounds capable of lowering 
      ATXN2 transcription. We observed dose-dependent reductions of endogenous ATXN2 in 
      HEK-293 cells treated with procillaridin 
      A, 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), and heat shock 
      protein 990 (HSP990), known inhibitors of HSP90 and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPases. 
      Furthermore, HEK-293 cells expressing polyglutamine-expanded ATXN2-Q58 treated 
      with 17-DMAG had minimally detectable ATXN2, as well as normalized markers of 
      autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress, including STAU1 (Staufen 1), 
      molecular target of rapamycin, p62, LC3-II (microtubule-associated protein 
      1A/1B-light chain 3II), CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein), and phospho-eIF2alpha 
      (eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha). Finally, bacterial artificial chromosome 
      ATXN2-Q22 mice treated with 17-DMAG or HSP990 exhibited highly reduced ATXN2 
      protein abundance in the cerebellum. Taken together, our study demonstrates 
      inhibition of HSP90 or Na(+)/K(+)-ATPases as potentially effective therapeutic 
      strategies for treating SCA2 and ALS.

      SCAs.
PG  - 1310-1315
LID - 10.1002/acn3.51613 [doi]
AB  - CAG repeat-expansion spinocerebellar ataxias (CAG-SCAs) are genetically defined 
      multisystemic degenerative diseases, resulting in motor symptoms including 
      dysarthria with a substantial impact on daily living. Whilst speech therapy is 
      widely recommended in ataxia, very limited evidence exists for its use. We 
      evaluated the efficacy of a home-delivered, ataxia-tailored biofeedback-driven 
      speech therapy in CAG-SCA in 16 individuals with SCA1, 2, 3, or 6. Treatment was 
      delivered intensively over 20 days. Efficacy was evaluated by blinded ratings of 
      intelligibility (primary) and acoustic measures (secondary) leveraging an 
      intra-individual control design. Intelligibility improved post-treatment 
      (Z = -3.18, p = 0.004) whilst remaining stable prior to treatment (Z = 0.53, 
      p = 1.00).

PG  - 670-674
LID - 10.3233/SHTI220162 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder 
      triggered by abnormal CAG repeat expansion at locus 5q32. MRI recognises 
      dissimilarities in affected areas of SCA12 patients and healthy subjects. But 
      manual diagnosis is time-consuming and prone to subjective errors. This has 
      motivated us in developing a systematic and authentic decision model for 
      computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of SCA12. Four different feature extraction 
      techniques are examined in this research work, such as First Order Statistics, 
      GLRLM, GLCM, and GLGCM, to obtain distinguishable characteristics for 
      differentiating SCA12 patients from healthy subjects. The model's performance is 
      measured using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and F1-score with leave-one-out 
      cross-validation scheme. Our experimental results show that features based on the 
      GLRLM can distinguish SCA12 from healthy subjects with a maximum classification 
      accuracy of 85% among all the different function extraction techniques used.

TI  - Calpains as novel players in the molecular pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 17.
PG  - 262
LID - 10.1007/s00018-022-04274-6 [doi]
LID - 262
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
      polyglutamine-encoding trinucleotide repeat expansion in the gene of 
      transcription factor TATA box-binding protein (TBP). While its underlying 
      pathomechanism is elusive, polyglutamine-expanded TBP fragments of unknown origin 
      mediate the mutant protein's toxicity. Calcium-dependent calpain proteases are 
      protagonists in neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we demonstrate that calpains 
      cleave TBP, and emerging C-terminal fragments mislocalize to the cytoplasm. SCA17 
      cell and rat models exhibited calpain overactivation, leading to excessive 
      fragmentation and depletion of neuronal proteins in vivo. Transcriptome analysis 
      of SCA17 cells revealed synaptogenesis and calcium signaling perturbations, 
      indicating the potential cause of elevated calpain activity. Pharmacological or 
      genetic calpain inhibition reduced TBP cleavage and aggregation, consequently 
      improving cell viability. Our work underlines the general significance of 
      calpains and their activating pathways in neurodegenerative disorders and 
      presents these proteases as novel players in the molecular pathogenesis of SCA17.

AB  - CAG-expanded ATXN7 has been previously defined in the pathogenesis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a polyglutamine expansion autosomal 
      dominant cerebellar ataxia. Pathology in SCA7 occurs as a result of a CAG triplet 
      repeat expansion in excess of 37 in the first exon of ATXN7, which encodes 
      ataxin-7. SCA7 presents clinically with spinocerebellar ataxia and cone-rod 
      dystrophy. Here, we present a novel spinocerebellar ataxia variant occurring in a 
      patient with mutations in both ATXN7 and TOP1MT, which encodes mitochondrial 
      topoisomerase I (top1mt). Using machine-guided, unbiased microscopy image 
      analysis, we demonstrate alterations in ataxin-7 subcellular localization, and 
      through high-fidelity measurements of cellular respiration, bioenergetic defects 
      in association with top1mt mutations. We identify ataxin-7 Q35P and top1mt R111W 
      as deleterious mutations, potentially contributing to disease states. We 
      recapitulate our mutations through Drosophila genetic models. Our work provides 
      important insight into the cellular biology of ataxin-7 and top1mt and offers 
      insight into the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia applicable to multiple 
      subtypes of the illness. Moreover, our study demonstrates an effective pipeline 
      for the characterization of previously unreported genetic variants at the level 
      of cell biology.

AB  - RNA toxicity contributes to diseases caused by anomalous nucleotide repeat 
      expansions. Recent work demonstrated RNA-based toxicity from repeat-associated, 
      non-AUG-initiated translation (RAN translation). RAN translation occurs around 
      long nucleotide repeats that form hairpin loops, allowing for translation 
      initiation in the absence of a start codon that results in potentially toxic, 
      poly-amino acid repeat-containing proteins. Discovered in Spinocerebellar Ataxia 
      Type (SCA) 8, RAN translation has been documented in several repeat-expansion 
      diseases, including in the CAG repeat-dependent polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders. 
      The ATXN3 gene, which causes SCA3, also known as Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD), 
      contains a CAG repeat that is expanded in disease. ATXN3 mRNA possesses features 
      linked to RAN translation. In this paper, we examined the potential contribution 
      of RAN translation to SCA3/MJD in Drosophila by using isogenic lines that contain 
      homomeric or interrupted CAG repeats. We did not observe unconventional 
      translation in fly neurons or glia. However, our investigations indicate 
      differential toxicity from ATXN3 protein-encoding mRNA that contains pure versus 
      interrupted CAG repeats. Additional work suggests that this difference may be due 
      in part to toxicity from homomeric CAG mRNA. We conclude that Drosophila is not 
      suitable to model RAN translation for SCA3/MJD, but offers clues into the 
      potential pathogenesis stemming from CAG repeat-containing mRNA in this disorder.

AB  - Repeat expansion diseases are a large group of human genetic disorders caused by 
      expansion of a specific short tandem repeat tract. Expansion in somatic cells 
      affects age of onset and disease severity in some of these disorders. However, 
      alleles in DNA derived from blood, a commonly used source of DNA, usually show 
      much less expansion than disease-relevant cells in the central nervous system in 
      both humans and mouse models. Here we examined the extent of expansion in 
      different DNA sources from mouse models of the fragile X-related disorders, 
      Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 and spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 2. We found that DNA isolated from stool is a much better indicator of 
      somatic expansion than DNA from blood. As stool is a sensitive and noninvasive 
      source of DNA, it can be useful for studies of factors affecting the risk of 
      expansion, or the monitoring of treatments aimed at reducing expansion in 
      preclinical trials, as it would allow expansions to be examined longitudinally in 
      the same animal and allow significant changes in expansion to be observed much 
      earlier than is possible with other DNA sources.

AB  - The age at onset of motor symptoms in Huntington's disease (HD) is driven by HTT 
      CAG repeat length but modified by other genes. In this study, we used exome 
      sequencing of 683 patients with HD with extremes of onset or phenotype relative 
      to CAG length to identify rare variants associated with clinical effect. We 
      discovered damaging coding variants in candidate modifier genes identified in 
      previous genome-wide association studies associated with altered HD onset or 
      severity. Variants in FAN1 clustered in its DNA-binding and nuclease domains and 
      were associated predominantly with earlier-onset HD. Nuclease activities of 
      purified variants in vitro correlated with residual age at motor onset of HD. 
      Mutating endogenous FAN1 to a nuclease-inactive form in an induced pluripotent 
      stem cell model of HD led to rates of CAG expansion similar to those observed 
      with complete FAN1 knockout. Together, these data implicate FAN1 nuclease 
      activity in slowing somatic repeat expansion and hence onset of HD.

TI  - Single-Tube Screen for Rapid Detection of Repeat Expansions in Seven Common 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxias.
PG  - 794-802
LID - 10.1093/clinchem/hvac011 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The autosomal dominantly inherited and genetically heterogeneous 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) exhibit highly similar clinical presentations. 
      Many are caused by repeat expansions, of which at least 8 involve CAG repeats. 
      Repeat expansion detection is the only method to confirm disease status in 
      symptomatic individuals. We present a novel strategy to simultaneously screen for 
      the presence of CAG repeat expansion in the genes responsible for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 
      6, 7, 12, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy using a simplified single-tube 
      assay. METHODS: The method employs differentially labeled locus-specific primers 
      and a common triplet-primed primer. Amplified products from each locus are 
      distinguished by a combination of the product size and the fluorophore tag. The 
      upper size limit of the normal allele range was used as the cutoff for 
      distinguishing normal from potentially affected samples, with repeat expansion 
      detected by presence of electrophoretic peaks extending beyond the cutoff. 
      RESULTS: Blinded evaluation of the assay on 60 genotype-known DNA samples 
      correctly detected repeat expansion in the expected SCA repeat locus for all 31 
      DNA samples. CONCLUSIONS: In principle, this strategy can be applied to the 
      simultaneous screening of any group of disease genes sharing the same repetitive 
      units and/or their reverse complement.

      disorders in the UK: a retrospective diagnostic accuracy and prospective clinical 
      validation study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansion disorders affect about 1 in 3000 individuals and are 
      clinically heterogeneous diseases caused by expansions of short tandem DNA 
      repeats. Genetic testing is often locus-specific, resulting in underdiagnosis of 
      people who have atypical clinical presentations, especially in paediatric 
      patients without a previous positive family history. Whole genome sequencing is 
      increasingly used as a first-line test for other rare genetic disorders, and we 
      aimed to assess its performance in the diagnosis of patients with neurological 
      repeat expansion disorders. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic 
      accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect the most common repeat expansion 
      loci associated with neurological outcomes (AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, 
      C9orf72, CACNA1A, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, and TBP) using samples obtained within 
      the National Health Service in England from patients who were suspected of having 
      neurological disorders; previous PCR test results were used as the reference 
      standard. The clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat 
      expansions was prospectively examined in previously genetically tested and 
      undiagnosed patients recruited in 2013-17 to the 100 000 Genomes Project in the 
      UK, who were suspected of having a genetic neurological disorder (familial or 
      early-onset forms of ataxia, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, dementia, motor 
      neuron disease, parkinsonian movement disorders, intellectual disability, or 
      neuromuscular disorders). If a repeat expansion call was made using whole genome 
      sequencing, PCR was used to confirm the result. FINDINGS: The diagnostic accuracy 
      of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat expansions was evaluated against 793 
      PCR tests previously performed within the NHS from 404 patients. Whole genome 
      sequencing correctly classified 215 of 221 expanded alleles and 1316 of 1321 
      non-expanded alleles, showing 97.3% sensitivity (95% CI 94.2-99.0) and 99.6% 
      specificity (99.1-99.9) across the 13 disease-associated loci when compared with 
      PCR test results. In samples from 11 631 patients in the 100 000 Genomes Project, 
      whole genome sequencing identified 81 repeat expansions, which were also tested 
      by PCR: 68 were confirmed as repeat expansions in the full pathogenic range, 11 
      were non-pathogenic intermediate expansions or premutations, and two were 
      non-expanded repeats (16% false discovery rate). INTERPRETATION: In our study, 
      whole genome sequencing for the detection of repeat expansions showed high 
      sensitivity and specificity, and it led to identification of neurological repeat 
      expansion disorders in previously undiagnosed patients. These findings support 
      implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical laboratories for diagnosis 
      of patients who have a neurological presentation consistent with a repeat 
      expansion disorder. FUNDING: Medical Research Council, Department of Health and

AB  - Expansion of d(GGCCTG)(n) hexanucleotide repeats in the NOP56 gene is the genetic 
      cause of spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36) which is an inheritable 
      neurodegenerative disease. Non-B DNA is known to be the structural intermediate 
      causing repeat expansions. Yet, the structure and mechanism of genetic 
      instability of d(GGCCTG)(n) repeats remain elusive. In this work, we investigated 
      the solution structures of sequences containing two to eight GGCCTG repeats using 
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. They were found to form diverse 
      secondary structures, including hairpin, duplex and G-quadruplex (G4). 
      Intriguingly, the hairpin structure was present in all the investigated 
      sequences. The NMR solution structure of the hairpin formed by d(GGCCTG)(2) was 
      determined, disclosing an unprecedented CCTGGG hexanucleotide loop in which the 
      first and sixth loop residues formed a Watson-Crick loop-closing base pair, the 
      second and third loop residues stacked in the major groove, whereas the fourth 
      and fifth loop residues formed a G.G mismatch. Apart from the hairpin, 
      antiparallel G4 and palindromic duplex structures were found to form in 
      d(GGCCTG)(2) and d(GGCCTG)(3)(-)(8), respectively. Results of this work provide 
      new insights into the genetic instability of d(GGCCTG)(n) repeats and 
      structure-based drug design for SCA36.

TI  - Genetic Distribution of Five Spinocerebellar Ataxia Microsatellite Loci in 
      Mexican Native American Populations and Its Impact on Contemporary Mestizo 
      Populations.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) conform a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders with autosomal dominant inheritance. Five of the most frequent SCAs are 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the exons of specific genes. The SCAs 
      incidence and the distribution of polymorphic CAG alleles vary among populations 
      and ethnicities. Thus, characterization of the genetic architecture of ethnically 
      diverse populations, which have undergone recent admixture and demographic 
      events, could facilitate the identification of genetic risk factors. Owing to the 
      great ethnic diversity of the Mexican population, this study aimed to analyze the 
      allele frequencies of five SCA microsatellite loci (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and 
      SCA7) in eleven Mexican Native American (MNA) populations. Data from the 
      literature were used to compare the allelic distribution of SCA loci with 
      worldwide populations. The SCA loci allelic frequencies evidenced a certain 
      genetic homogeneity in the MNA populations, except for Mayans, who exhibited 
      distinctive genetic profiles. Neither pathological nor large normal alleles were 
      found in MNA populations, except for the SCA2 pre-mutated allele in the Zapotec 
      population. Collectively, our findings demonstrated the contribution of the MNA 
      ancestry in shaping the genetic structure of contemporary Mexican Mestizo 
      populations. Our results also suggest that Native American ancestry has no impact 
      on the origin of SCAs in the Mexican population. Instead, the acquisition of 
      pathological SCA alleles could be associated with European migration.

      Pathogenesis.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia Type 3 (SCA3), the most common dominantly inherited 
      ataxia, is a polyglutamine neurodegenerative disease for which there is no 
      disease-modifying therapy. The polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the 
      ATXN3 gene results in expression of a mutant form of the ATXN3 protein, a 
      deubiquitinase that causes selective neurodegeneration despite being widely 
      expressed. The mechanisms driving neurodegeneration in SCA3 are unclear. Research 
      to date, however, has focused almost exclusively on neurons. Here, using equal 
      male and female age-matched transgenic mice expressing full-length human mutant 
      ATXN3, we identified early and robust transcriptional changes in selectively 
      vulnerable brain regions that implicate oligodendrocytes in disease pathogenesis. 
      We mapped transcriptional changes across early, mid, and late stages of disease 
      in two selectively vulnerable brain regions: the cerebellum and brainstem. The 
      most significant disease-associated module through weighted gene coexpression 
      network analysis revealed dysfunction in SCA3 oligodendrocyte maturation. These 
      results reflect a toxic gain-of-function mechanism, as ATXN3 KO mice do not 
      exhibit any impairments in oligodendrocyte maturation. Genetic crosses to 
      reporter mice revealed a marked reduction in mature oligodendrocytes in 
      SCA3-disease vulnerable brain regions, and ultrastructural microscopy confirmed 
      abnormalities in axonal myelination. Further study of isolated oligodendrocyte 
      precursor cells from SCA3 mice established that this impairment in 
      oligodendrocyte maturation is a cell-autonomous process. We conclude that SCA3 is 
      not simply a disease of neurons, and the search for therapeutic strategies and 
      disease biomarkers will need to account for non-neuronal involvement in SCA3 
      pathogenesis.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Despite advances in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      Type 3 (SCA3) disease understanding, much remains unknown about how the disease 
      gene causes brain dysfunction ultimately leading to cell death. We completed a 
      longitudinal transcriptomic analysis of vulnerable brain regions in SCA3 mice to 
      define the earliest and most robust changes across disease progression. Through 
      gene network analyses followed up with biochemical and histologic studies in SCA3 
      mice, we provide evidence for severe dysfunction in oligodendrocyte maturation 
      early in SCA3 pathogenesis. Our results advance understanding of SCA3 disease 
      mechanisms, identify additional routes for therapeutic intervention, and may 
      provide broader insight into polyglutamine diseases beyond SCA3.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to unravel the genetic factors underlying missing 
      heritability in spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) caused by 
      polyglutamine-encoding CAG/CAA repeat expansions in the TBP gene. Alleles with 
      >49 CAG/CAA repeats are fully penetrant. Most patients, however, carry 
      intermediate TBP(41-49) alleles that show incomplete penetrance. METHODS: Using 
      next-generation sequencing approaches, we investigated 40 SCA17/TBP(41-54) index 
      patients, their affected (n = 55) and unaffected (n = 51) relatives, and a cohort 
      of patients with ataxia (n = 292). RESULTS: All except 1 (30/31) of the index 
      cases with TBP(41-46) alleles carried a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the 
      STUB1 gene associated with spinocerebellar ataxias SCAR16 (autosomal recessive) 
      and SCA48 (autosomal dominant). No STUB1 variant was found in patients carrying 
      TBP(47-54) alleles. TBP(41-46) expansions and STUB1 variants cosegregate in all 
      affected family members, whereas the presence of either TBP(41-46) expansions or 
      STUB1 variants individually was never associated with the disease. CONCLUSION: 
      Our data reveal an unexpected genetic interaction between STUB1 and TBP in the 
      pathogenesis of SCA17 and raise questions on the existence of SCA48 as a 
      monogenic disease with crucial implications for diagnosis and counseling. They 
      provide a convincing explanation for the incomplete penetrance of intermediate 
      TBP alleles and demonstrate a dual inheritance pattern for SCA17, which is a 
      monogenic dominant disorder for TBP(>/=47) alleles and a digenic TBP/STUB1 disease 
      (SCA17-DI) for intermediate expansions.

AB  - Ongoing inchworm-like CAG and CGG repeat expansions in brains, arising by 
      aberrant processing of slipped DNAs, may drive Huntington's disease, fragile X 
      syndrome, and autism. FAN1 nuclease modifies hyper-expansion rates by unknown 
      means. We show that FAN1, through iterative cycles, binds, dimerizes, and cleaves 
      slipped DNAs, yielding striking exo-nuclease pauses along slip-outs: 
      5'-C downward arrowA downward arrowGC downward arrowA downward arrowG-3' and 5'-C downward arrowT downward arrowG downward arrowC downward arrowT downward arrowG-3'. CAG excision is slower than CTG and 
      requires intra-strand A.A and T.T mismatches. Fully paired hairpins arrested 
      excision, whereas disease-delaying CAA interruptions further slowed excision. 
      Endo-nucleolytic cleavage is insensitive to slip-outs. Rare FAN1 variants are 
      found in individuals with autism with CGG/CCG expansions, and CGG/CCG slip-outs 
      show exo-nuclease pauses. The slip-out-specific ligand, 
      naphthyridine-azaquinolone, which induces contractions of expanded repeats 
      in vivo, requires FAN1 for its effect, and protects slip-outs from FAN1 exo-, but 
      not endo-, nucleolytic digestion. FAN1's inchworm pausing of slip-out excision 
      rates is well suited to modify inchworm expansion rates, which modify disease 
      onset and progression.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant hereditary 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion of a CAG-repeat in the ataxin-7 
      (ATXN7) gene, usually characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia and retinal 
      dystrophy. We report the case of a 45-year-old woman presenting with a 
      rapid-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) phenotype associated with a 
      39-CAG-repeat expansion in ATXN7. This patient had neither ataxia nor retinal 
      dystrophy, but she had an oculomotor cerebellar syndrome and a family history 
      suggestive of SCA7. In SCA7, shorter expansions may be associated with less 
      severe and incomplete clinical phenotypes, which could explain the patient's 
      phenotype. Unknown genetic and environmental factors may also influence the 
      patient's phenotype. We suggest that a pathological expansion in ATXN7 should be 
      considered in cases of ALS-like phenotype, particularly when associated with 
      oculomotor abnormalities or a family history of ataxia or blindness.

TI  - A Novel SCA3 Knock-in Mouse Model Mimics the Human SCA3 Disease Phenotype

      Especially in Oligodendrocytes.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is the most common autosomal dominant inherited 
      ataxia worldwide, caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the Ataxin-3 gene resulting 
      in a polyglutamine (polyQ)-expansion in the corresponding protein. The disease is 
      characterized by neuropathological, phenotypical, and specific transcriptional 
      changes in affected brain regions. So far, there is no mouse model available 
      representing all the different aspects of the disease, yet highly needed for a 
      better understanding of the disease pathomechanisms. Here, we characterized a 
      novel Ataxin-3 knock-in mouse model, expressing a heterozygous or homozygous 
      expansion of 304 CAACAGs in the murine Ataxin-3 locus using biochemical, 
      behavioral, and transcriptomic approaches. We compared neuropathological, and 
      behavioral features of the new knock-in model with the in SCA3 research mostly 
      used YAC84Q mouse model. Further, we compared transcriptional changes found in 
      cerebellar samples of the SCA3 knock-in mice and post-mortem human SCA3 patients. 
      The novel knock-in mouse is characterized by the expression of a polyQ-expansion 
      in the murine Ataxin-3 protein, leading to aggregate formation, especially in 
      brain regions known to be vulnerable in SCA3 patients, and impairment of Purkinje 
      cells. Along these neuropathological changes, the mice showed a reduction in body 
      weight accompanied by gait and balance instability. Transcriptomic analysis of 
      cerebellar tissue revealed age-dependent differential expression, enriched for 
      genes attributed to myelinating oligodendrocytes. Comparing these changes with 
      those found in cerebellar tissue of SCA3 patients, we discovered an overlap of 
      differentially expressed genes pointing towards similar gene expression

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most common autosomal 
      dominant spinocerebellar ataxia worldwide. Almost all patients with SCA3 exhibit 
      nystagmus and/or saccades impairment. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence of 
      nystagmus as an early neurological manifestation, before ataxia, in some patients 
      with SCA3 in the first six months of the disease. METHODS: We evaluated a series 
      of 155 patients with clinically and molecularly proven SCA3 between 2013 and 
      2020. Data regarding sex, age, age at onset, disease duration, CAG repeat 
      expansion length, first symptom, presence of ataxia, scores on SARA and ICARS 
      scales, and presence and characteristics of nystagmus were collected. RESULTS: We 
      identified seven patients with symptomatic SCA3 who presented with isolated 
      nystagmus. In these seven individuals the age at onset ranged from 24 to 57 
      years, and disease duration from four to six months. CONCLUSIONS: Our study 
      showed that nystagmus may be the first neurological sign in SCA3. This clinical 
      observation reinforces the idea that the neurodegenerative process in SCA3 
      patients may start in vestibular system connections or in flocculonodular lobe. 
      This study adds relevant information about pre-symptomatic features in SCA3 that 
      may work as basis for a better understanding of brain degeneration and for future 
      therapeutic clinical trials.

      Spinocerebellar Ataxia.
PG  - 401-404
LID - 10.1002/mds.28835 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a progressive, autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder typically associated with CAG repeat expansions. 
      OBJECTIVE: We assessed the pathogenicity of the novel, heterozygous missense 
      variant p.Cys256Phe (C256F) in the pore-forming alpha1-subunit of the Cav2.1 Ca(2+) 
      channel found in a 63-year-old woman with SCA with no CAG repeat expansion. 
      METHODS: We examined the effect of the C256F variant on channel function using 
      whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in transfected tsA-201 cells. RESULTS: The 
      maximum Ca(2+) current density was significantly reduced in the mutant compared 
      to wild-type, which could not be explained by lower expression levels of mutant 
      Cav2.1 alpha1- protein. Together with a significant increase in current inactivation, 
      this is consistent with a loss of channel function. Molecular modeling predicted 
      disruption of a conserved disulfide bond through the C256F variant. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our results support the pathogenicity of the C256F variant for the SCA phenotype 
      and provide further insight into Cav2.1 structure and function.

TI  - Detection Methods and Status of CAT Interruption of ATXN1 in Korean Patients With 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1.
PG  - 274-277
LID - 10.3343/alm.2022.42.2.274 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by 
      abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin 1 gene (ATXN1). The presence of CAT 
      interruption(s) is important for diagnosing SCA1 in patients with 39-44 repeat 
      alleles, as only uninterrupted alleles are considered abnormal. Determining the 
      CAT interruption status might also be important for patients with >44 repeats, as 
      the length of the longest uninterrupted CAG repeat stretch has been correlated 
      with age at SCA1 onset. We detected CAT interruption(s) in the archived samples 
      of Korean SCA1 patients using a traditional restriction enzyme method and 
      validated the usefulness of a fluorescence-based tethering PCR procedure. Among 
      the 2,312 alleles analyzed from 1,156 patients, we found 17 expanded alleles with 
      >/=39 repeats, 71% of which harbored 39-44 repeats. Restriction enzyme method of 
      six samples (four with 39-44 repeats and two with >44 repeats) revealed that none 
      of the expanded alleles had CAT interruption(s). Tethering PCR showed the 
      characteristic electropherogram pattern expected without CAT interruption(s). 
      Along with the enzyme restriction method, tethering PCR can be applied to 
      determine the number of allele repeats and provide information on CAT 
      interruption(s) in clinical laboratories.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of hereditary ataxia in Finland.
PG  - 382

LID - 382
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetics of cerebellar ataxia is complex. Hundreds of causative 
      genes have been identified, but only a few cause more than single cases. The 
      spectrum of ataxia-causing genes differs considerably between populations. The 
      aim of the study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of ataxia in the 
      Finnish population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients in hospital database were 
      reviewed for the diagnosis of unspecified ataxia. Acquired ataxias and nongenetic 
      ataxias such as those related to infection, trauma or stroke were excluded. Sixty 
      patients with sporadic ataxia with unknown etiology and 36 patients with familial 
      ataxia of unknown etiology were recruited in the study. Repeat expansions in the 
      SCA genes (ATXN1, 2, 3, 7, 8/OS, CACNA1A, TBP), FXN, and RFC1 were determined. 
      Point mutations in POLG, SPG7 and in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were investigated. 
      In addition, DNA from 8 patients was exome sequenced. RESULTS: A genetic cause of 
      ataxia was found in 33 patients (34.4%). Seven patients had a dominantly 
      inherited repeat expansion in ATXN8/OS. Ten patients had mitochondrial ataxia 
      resulting from mutations in nuclear mitochondrial genes POLG or RARS2, or from a 
      point mutation m.8561C > G or a single deletion in mtDNA. Interestingly, five 
      patients were biallelic for the recently identified pathogenic repeat expansion 
      in RFC1. All the five patients presented with the phenotype of cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia (CANVAS). Moreover, screening of 54 patients 
      with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy revealed four additional patients with 
      biallelic repeat expansion in RFC1, but none of them had cerebellar symptoms. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Expansion in ATXN8/OS results in the majority of dominant ataxias in 
      Finland, while mutations in RFC1 and POLG are the most common cause of recessive 
      ataxias. Our results suggest that analysis of RFC1 should be included in the 
      routine diagnostics of idiopathic ataxia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth polyneuropathy.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease) is a 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by inheritance of a CAG repeat expansion within 
      the ATXN3 gene, resulting in polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion within the 
      ataxin-3 protein. In this study, we have identified protein aggregates in both 
      neuronal-like (SHSY5Y) cells and transgenic zebrafish expressing human ataxin-3 
      with expanded polyQ. We have adapted a previously reported flow cytometry 
      methodology named flow cytometric analysis of inclusions and trafficking, 
      allowing rapid quantification of detergent insoluble forms of ataxin-3 fused to a 
      GFP in SHSY5Y cells and cells dissociated from the zebrafish larvae. Flow 
      cytometric analysis revealed an increased number of detergent-insoluble ataxin-3 
      particles per nuclei in cells and in zebrafish expressing polyQ-expanded ataxin-3 
      compared to those expressing wild-type human ataxin-3. Treatment with compounds 
      known to modulate autophagic activity altered the number of detergent-insoluble 
      ataxin-3 particles in cells and zebrafish expressing mutant human ataxin-3. We 
      conclude that flow cytometry can be harnessed to rapidly count ataxin-3 
      aggregates, both in vitro and in vivo, and can be used to compare potential 
      therapies targeting protein aggregates. This article has an associated First 
      Person interview with the first author of the paper.

      Ataxia Type 3 in Peripheral Blood.

LID - 10.1002/mds.28749 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is a rare neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin-3 gene. Although no curative 
      therapy is yet available, preclinical gene-silencing approaches to reduce 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) toxicity demonstrate promising results. In view of upcoming 
      clinical trials, quantitative and easily accessible molecular markers are of 
      critical importance as pharmacodynamic and particularly as target engagement 
      markers. OBJECTIVE: We aimed at developing an ultrasensitive immunoassay to 
      measure specifically polyQ-expanded ataxin-3 in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid 
      (CSF). METHODS: Using the novel single molecule counting ataxin-3 immunoassay, we 
      analyzed cross-sectional and longitudinal patient biomaterials. RESULTS: 
      Statistical analyses revealed a correlation with clinical parameters and a 
      stability of polyQ-expanded ataxin-3 during conversion from the pre-ataxic to the 
      ataxic phases. CONCLUSIONS: The novel immunoassay is able to quantify 
      polyQ-expanded ataxin-3 in plasma and CSF, whereas ataxin-3 levels in plasma 
      correlate with disease severity. Longitudinal analyses demonstrated a high 
      stability of polyQ-expanded ataxin-3 over a short period. (c) 2021 The Authors.

LID - 10.1002/mds.28729 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in Ataxin-2 (ATXN2) gene. The mutant ATXN2 
      protein with a polyglutamine tract is known to be toxic and contributes to the 
      SCA2 pathogenesis. OBJECTIVE: Here, we tested the hypothesis that the mutant 
      ATXN2 transcript with an expanded CAG repeat (expATXN2) is also toxic and 
      contributes to SCA2 pathogenesis. METHODS: The toxic effect of expATXN2 
      transcripts on SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells and primary mouse cortical neurons was 
      evaluated by caspase 3/7 activity and nuclear condensation assay, respectively. 
      RNA immunoprecipitation assay was performed to identify RNA binding proteins 
      (RBPs) that bind to expATXN2 RNA. Quantitative PCR was used to examine if 
      ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing is disrupted in SCA2 and Huntington's disease 
      (HD) human brain tissue. RESULTS: expATXN2 RNA induces neuronal cell death, and 
      aberrantly interacts with RBPs involved in RNA metabolism. One of the RBPs, 
      transducin beta-like protein 3 (TBL3), involved in rRNA processing, binds to both 
      expATXN2 and expanded huntingtin (expHTT) RNA in vitro. rRNA processing is 
      disrupted in both SCA2 and HD human brain tissue. CONCLUSION: These findings 
      provide the first evidence of a contributory role of expATXN2 transcripts in SCA2 
      pathogenesis, and further support the role of expHTT transcripts in HD 
      pathogenesis. The disruption of rRNA processing, mediated by aberrant interaction 
      of RBPs with expATXN2 and expHTT transcripts, suggest a point of convergence in 
      the pathogeneses of repeat expansion diseases with potential therapeutic 
      implications. (c) 2021 The Authors. Movement Disorders published by Wiley

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hereditary ataxias demonstrate a high degree of clinical and 
      genetic heterogeneity. Understanding the genetic etiology of hereditary ataxias 
      is crucial for genetic counseling and clinical management. METHODS: The clinical 
      and genetic data of patients with familial or sporadic ataxias who referred to 
      our tertiary medical center were retrospectively analyzed. Probands in this study 
      underwent SCA repeat expansion panel firstly to screen for repeat expansion SCAs; 
      those with negative results had NGS-targeted panels or WES testing to detect 
      conventional mutations. RESULTS: A total of 223 patients were enrolled from 206 
      families. 5 kinds of coexisting SCA repeat expansions were observed (SCA3/SCA17, 
      SCA3/SCA8, SCA2/SCA8, SCA3/SCA12 and SCA8/SCA12) in 12 patients from 8 families, 
      among which SCA2/SCA8, SCA8/SCA12 and SCA3/SCA12 were reported for the first 
      time. The coexistence of expanded SCA3 with SCA17 alleles was the most common in 
      our study. NGS identified pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 12 ataxia 
      causative genes in 13 probands. Spastic paraplegia ataxia was the most common 
      diagnosis. Six novel mutations were detected in five ataxia-related genes. 
      CONCLUSION: Coexistence may not specific to a certain SCA subtype and the 
      frequency might have been underestimated before. SCA repeat expansion panel 
      should be considered in patients with overlapping SCA features. In addition, our 
      study broadened the conventional mutation spectrum in ataxia-related genes. These 
      results facilitate a better understanding of the genetic basis for hereditary 
      ataxias.

TI  - Cervical Spinal Cord Degeneration in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 7.
PG  - 1735-1739
LID - 10.3174/ajnr.A7202 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by a cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat 
      expansion. Clinically, spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 is characterized by 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal signs, and macular degeneration. In vivo 
      MR imaging studies have shown extensive gray matter degeneration in the 
      cerebellum and, to a lesser extent, in a range of cortical cerebral areas. The 
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the disease in the spinal 
      cord and its relationship with the patient's impairment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Using a semiautomated procedure applied to MR imaging data, we analyzed spinal 
      cord area and eccentricity in a cohort of 48 patients with spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 7 and compared them with matched healthy controls. The motor impairment in 
      the patient group was evaluated using the Scale for Assessment and Rating of 
      Ataxia. RESULTS: Our analysis showed a significantly smaller cord area (t = 9.04, 
      P < .001, d = 1.31) and greater eccentricity (t = -2.25, P =. 02, d = 0.32) in 
      the patient group. Similarly, smaller cord area was significantly correlated with 
      a greater Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia score (r = -0.44, P = .001). 
      A multiple regression model showed that the spinal cord area was strongly 
      associated with longer CAG repetition expansions (P = .002) and greater disease 
      duration (P = .020). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that cervical spinal cord 
      changes are progressive and clinically relevant features of spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 7, and future investigation of these measures as candidate biomarkers 
      is warranted.

TI  - Variants in Genes of Calpain System as Modifiers of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 
      Phenotype.
PG  - 1906-1913
LID - 10.1007/s12031-021-01877-9 [doi]
AB  - Calpain-mediated proteolysis has been proposed to modulate the pathogenesis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), a 
      disorder due to a CAG repeat expansion (CAGexp) at ATXN3. We aimed to investigate 
      if single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at calpain gene CAPN2 and at 
      calpastatin gene CAST modulate the age at onset (AO) and disease progression in 
      SCA3/MJD. A total of 287 SCA3/MJD symptomatic subjects (151 families) were 
      included. AO was analyzed and controlled by the CAG repeat length of expanded 
      allele and family. Candidate polymorphisms were chosen based on the literature 
      and on a priori criteria. The CAG repeat length and SNPs were genotyped according 
      to standard methods. AO of carriers of AA and AG + GG(rs1559085) genotypes in 
      CAST and with the median value of 75 repeats at the expanded allele were 34.23 
      (33.07-35.38) and 36.42 years (34.50-38.34), respectively (p = 0.049, mixed model 
      treating the expanded CAG repeat size as fixed effect and family as random 
      effect). Carriers of haplotype C(rs27852)/G(rs1559085) had mean AO of 37.23 
      (12.76) and 33.42 years (12.20) (p = 0.047, Student's t test). Our data suggest 
      an association between allele G(rs1559085) and haplotype C(rs27852)/G(rs1559085) 
      at CAST and variations in the AO of SCA3/MJD subjects, independent from the 
      effects of the CAGexp and family. The present results support the potential role 
      of calpain cleavage pathway over modulation of SCA3/MJD phenotype.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
      heterozygous CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin 3 gene (ATXN3). However, patients 
      with homozygous SCA3 carrying expanded CAG repeats in both alleles of ATXN3 are 
      extremely rare. Herein, we present a case of a 50-year-old female who had 
      homozygous SCA3 with expansion of 62/62 repeats. Segregation analysis of the 
      patient's family showed both a contraction pattern of CAG repeat length and 
      stable transmission. The present case demonstrated an earlier onset and more 
      severe clinical phenotype than that seen in heterozygous individuals, suggesting 
      that the gene dosage enhances disease severity.

AB  - CAG repeat expansion is the genetic cause of nine incurable polyglutamine (polyQ) 
      diseases with neurodegenerative features. Silencing repeat RNA holds great 
      therapeutic value. Here, we developed a repeat-based RNA-cleaving DNAzyme that 
      catalyzes the destruction of expanded CAG repeat RNA of six polyQ diseases with 
      high potency. DNAzyme preferentially cleaved the expanded allele in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) cells. While cleavage was 
      non-allele-specific for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) cells, treatment of 
      DNAzyme leads to improved cell viability without affecting mitochondrial 
      metabolism or p62-dependent aggresome formation. DNAzyme appears to be stable in 
      mouse brain for at least 1 month, and an intermediate dosage of DNAzyme in a SCA3 
      mouse model leads to a significant reduction of high molecular weight ATXN3 
      proteins. Our data suggest that DNAzyme is an effective RNA silencing molecule 
      for potential treatment of multiple polyQ diseases.

TI  - Respiratory dysfunction in a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 7.
LID - 10.1242/dmm.048893 [doi]
LID - dmm048893
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of the ataxin-7 
      gene. Infantile-onset SCA7 patients display extremely large repeat expansions 
      (>200 CAGs) and exhibit progressive ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia and retinal 
      degeneration. Severe hypotonia, aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure 
      often contribute to death in affected infants. To better understand the features 
      of respiratory and upper airway dysfunction in SCA7, we examined breathing and 
      putative phrenic and hypoglossal neuropathology in a knock-in mouse model of 
      early-onset SCA7 carrying an expanded allele with 266 CAG repeats. Whole-body 
      plethysmography was used to measure awake spontaneously breathing SCA7-266Q 
      knock-in mice at baseline in normoxia and during a hypercapnic/hypoxic 
      respiratory challenge at 4 and 8 weeks, before and after the onset of disease. 
      Postmortem studies included quantification of putative phrenic and hypoglossal 
      motor neurons and microglia, and analysis of ataxin-7 aggregation at end stage. 
      SCA7-266Q mice had profound breathing deficits during a respiratory challenge, 
      exhibiting reduced respiratory output and a greater percentage of time in apnea. 
      Histologically, putative phrenic and hypoglossal motor neurons of SCA7 mice 
      exhibited a reduction in number accompanied by increased microglial activation, 
      indicating neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, intranuclear 
      ataxin-7 accumulation was observed in cells neighboring putative phrenic and 
      hypoglossal motor neurons in SCA7 mice. These findings reveal the importance of 
      phrenic and hypoglossal motor neuron pathology associated with respiratory 
      failure and upper airway dysfunction, which are observed in infantile-onset SCA7 
      patients and likely contribute to their early death.

AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA) is a heterogeneous adult-onset disorder with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance pattern mainly caused by triplet repeat 
      expansions. Clinical diagnosis of SCA is based on phenotypic features followed by 
      confirmation through molecular diagnosis. To identify status of repeat range in 
      Indian SCA cases and provide extended family screening, we enrolled 70 clinical 
      SCA suspects. For molecular diagnosis, multiplex PCR (M-PCR) was used for common 
      Indian SCA subtypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12 and 17. TP-PCR was further used in 
      SCA2, 7 and 10 to identify larger expansions. Eighteen out of 70 SCA suspects 
      (25%) were found to be positive for various SCA subtypes- (5 SCA1 (28%), 6 SAC2 
      (34%), 2 SCA3 (12%), 3 SCA7 (16%) and one each for SCA6 (1%) and SCA17 (1%) 
      subtypes). Genetic counselling and extended family screening were offered to all 
      positive cases and yielded additional nine cases. We have established M-PCR and 
      TP-PCR to detect the CAG repeat expansion in SCA suspects. This method can 
      confirm SCA subtypes in a reliable, rapid and cost-effective way. Genetic 
      characterization of SCA-related genes has great clinical relevance, as it could 
      provide additional information and guidance to clinicians and family members 
      regarding prognosis.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by CAG repeat expansion of the ATXN3 gene encoding ataxin-3 protein and is 
      mainly manifested by motor symptoms such as ataxia and non-motor symptoms such as 
      cognitive dysfunction. In this study, we obtained skin fibroblasts from a SCA3 
      patient and successfully constructed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using 
      the reprogramming plasmids expressing OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, LIN28, and L-MYC. The 
      generated iPSC line had a stable karyotype, expressed pluripotency markers, and 
      could differentiate into all three germ layers in vitro. In addition, the iPSC 
      line may be a useful model for identifying SCA3-related pathological mechanisms.

TI  - Toxicity of pathogenic ataxin-2 in Drosophila shows dependence on a pure CAG 
      repeat sequence.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 is a polyglutamine (polyQ) disease associated with 
      an expanded polyQ domain within the protein product of the ATXN2 gene. 
      Interestingly, polyQ repeat expansions in ATXN2 are also associated with 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and parkinsonism depending upon the length of 
      the polyQ repeat expansion. The sequence encoding the polyQ repeat also varies 
      with disease presentation: a pure CAG repeat is associated with SCA2, whereas the 
      CAG repeat in ALS and parkinsonism is typically interrupted with the glutamine 
      encoding CAA codon. Here, we asked if the purity of the CAG sequence encoding the 
      polyQ repeat in ATXN2 could impact the toxicity of the ataxin-2 protein in vivo 
      in Drosophila. We found that ataxin-2 encoded by a pure CAG repeat conferred 
      toxicity in the retina and nervous system, whereas ataxin-2 encoded by a 
      CAA-interrupted repeat or CAA-only repeat failed to confer toxicity, despite 
      expression of the protein at similar levels. Furthermore, the CAG-encoded 
      ataxin-2 protein aggregated in the fly eye, while ataxin-2 encoded by either a 
      CAA/G or CAA repeat remained diffuse. The toxicity of the CAG-encoded ataxin-2 
      protein was also sensitive to the translation factor eIF4H, a known modifier of 
      the toxic GGGGCC repeat in flies. These data indicate that ataxin-2 encoded by a 
      pure CAG versus interrupted CAA/G polyQ repeat domain is associated with 
      differential toxicity, indicating that mechanisms associated with the purity of 
      the sequence of the polyQ domain contribute to disease.

PG  - 4866-4873

AB  - Adult-onset ataxias are a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of 
      movement disorders. In addition to nuclear gene mutations, sequence changes have 
      also been described in the mitochondrial genome. Here, we present findings of 
      mutation analysis of the mitochondrial gene MT-ATP6. We analyzed 94 patients with 
      adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), including 34 sporadic cases. In all 
      patients, common sequence changes found in SCAs such as repeat expansions and 
      point mutations had been excluded previously. We found pathogenic MT-ATP variants 
      in five of these patients (5.32%), two of whom were sporadic. Four of the five 
      mutations have not previously been described in ataxias. All but one of these 
      mutations affect transmembrane helices of subunit-alpha of ATP synthase. Two 
      mutations (p.G16S, and p.P18S) disrupt transmembrane helix 1 (TMH1), one mutation 
      (p.G167D) affects TMH5, and another one (p.L217P) TMH6. The fifth mutation 
      (p.T96A) describes an amino acid change in close proximity to transmembrane helix 
      3 (TMH3). The level of heteroplasmy was either complete or very high ranging from 
      87 to 99%. The high prevalence of pathogenic MT-ATP6 variants suggests that 
      analysis of this gene should be included in the routine workup of both hereditary 
      and sporadic ataxias.

TI  - Midbrain atrophy related to parkinsonism in a non-coding repeat expansion

      dopaminergic dysfunction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 (SCA31) is caused by non-coding 
      pentanucleotide repeat expansions in the BEAN1 gene. Clinically, SCA31 is 
      characterized by late adult-onset, pure cerebellar ataxia. To explore the 
      association between parkinsonism and SCA31, five patients with SCA31 with 
      concomitant nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction (NSDD) development, including 
      three cases of L-DOPA responsive parkinsonism, were analyzed. METHODS: To assess 
      regional brain atrophy, cross-sectional and longitudinal imaging analyses were 
      retrospectively performed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) planimetry. The 
      midbrain-to-pons (M/P) area ratio and cerebellar area were measured on 
      midsagittal T1-weighted MRI in five patients with SCA31 with concomitant NSDD 
      (NSDD(+)), 14 patients with SCA31 without NSDD (NSDD(-)), 32 patients with 
      Parkinson's disease (PD), and 15 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy 
      (PSP). Longitudinal changes in the M/P area ratio were assessed by serial MRI of 
      NSDD(+) (n = 5) and NSDD(-) (n = 9). RESULTS: The clinical characteristics 
      assessed in the five patients with NSDD were as follows: the mean age at NSDD 
      onset (72.0 +/- 10.8 years), prominence of bradykinesia/akinesia (5/5), rigidity 
      (4/5), tremor (2/5), dysautonomia (0/5), vertical gaze limitation (1/5), and 
      abnormalities on (123)I-ioflupane dopamine transporter scintigraphy (3/3) and 
      3-Tesla neuromelanin MRI (4/4). A clear reduction in the midbrain area and the 
      M/P area ratio was observed in the NSDD(+) group (p < 0.05) while there was no 
      significant difference in disease duration or in the pons area among the NSDD(+), 
      NSDD(-), and PD groups. There was also a significant difference in the midbrain 
      and pons area between NSDD(+) and PSP (p < 0.05). Thus, mild but significant 
      midbrain atrophy was observed in NSDD(+). A faster rate of decline in the 
      midbrain area and the M/P area ratio was evident in NSDD(+) (p < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: The clinical characteristics of the five patients with SCA31 with 
      concomitant NSDD, together with the topographical pattern of atrophy, were 
      inconsistent with PD, PSP, and multiple system atrophy, suggesting that SCA31 may 
      manifest NSDD in association with the pathomechanisms underlying SCA31.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36) is a noncoding repeat expansion disorder 
      caused by an expanded GGCCTG hexanucleotide repeat (HNR) in the first intron of 
      the nucleolar protein 56 (NOP56) gene. Another disease-causing HNR expansion 
      derived from C9orf72-linked GGGGCC repeats that form G-quadruplexes (GQs) affects 
      genetic stability, RNA splicing, and mRNA localization within neurites. The 
      porphyrin derivative TMPyP4 was shown to ameliorate RNA toxicity caused by GGGGCC 
      HNR expansion by binding and distorting RNA GQ structures. SCA36 GGCCTG HNRs can 
      potentially form RNA GQs; therefore, we investigated whether several porphyrin 
      derivatives could reduce RNA toxicity in SCA36 cell models. Among these, sodium 
      copper chlorophyllin and hemin chloride, which have already been used in clinical 
      practice, reduced SCA36 GGCCTG expansion-mediated cytotoxicity and improved cell 
      viability. These data suggest that porphyrins are potential therapeutic 
      candidates against SCA36 pathogenesis.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the ATXN7 gene. Patients with this 
      disease suffer from a degeneration of their cerebellar Purkinje neurons and 
      retinal photoreceptors that result in a progressive ataxia and loss of vision. As 
      with many neurodegenerative diseases, studies of pathogenesis have been hindered 
      by a lack of disease-relevant models. To this end, we have generated induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a cohort of SCA7 patients in South Africa. 
      First, we differentiated the SCA7 affected iPSCs into neurons which showed 
      evidence of a transcriptional phenotype affecting components of STAGA (ATXN7 and 
      KAT2A) and the heat shock protein pathway (DNAJA1 and HSP70). We then performed 
      electrophysiology on the SCA7 iPSC-derived neurons and found that these cells 
      show features of functional aberrations. Lastly, we were able to differentiate 
      the SCA7 iPSCs into retinal photoreceptors that also showed similar 
      transcriptional aberrations to the SCA7 neurons. Our findings give technical 
      insights on how iPSC-derived neurons and photoreceptors can be derived from SCA7 
      patients and demonstrate that these cells express molecular and 
      electrophysiological differences that may be indicative of impaired neuronal 
      health. We hope that these findings will contribute towards the ongoing efforts 
      to establish the cell-derived models of neurodegenerative diseases that are 
      needed to develop patient-specific treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We intended to clarify the phenotypic and molecular diversities of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) in Japan. METHODS: DNA was extracted from 
      the peripheral blood of 436 patients, including 126 patients with chronic 
      neuropathy, 108 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and 202 with cerebellar 
      ataxia. We then PCR-amplified and sequenced the ATXN2 gene. The biopsied sural 
      nerves of mutation-positive patients were subjected to light-microscopic and 
      electron-microscopic analyses. Transfection analyses were performed using a 
      Schwann cell line, IMS32. RESULTS: We found PCR-amplified products potentially 
      corresponding to expanded CAG repeats in four patients. Two patients in the 
      chronic neuropathy group had a full repeat expansion or an intermediate expansion 
      (39 or 32 repeats), without limb ataxia. The sural nerve biopsy findings of the 
      two patients included axonal neuropathy and mixed neuropathy (axonal changes with 
      demyelination). Schwann cells harbored either cytoplasmic or nuclear inclusions 
      on electron microscopic examination. Both patients recently exhibited pyramidal 
      signs. In the third patient in the cerebellar ataxia group, we identified a novel 
      21-base duplication mutation near 22 CAG repeats (c.432_452dup). The transfection 
      study revealed that the 21-base-duplication mutant Ataxin-2 proteins aggregated 
      in IMS32 and rendered cells susceptible to oxidative stress, similar to a 
      CAG-expanded mutant. The fourth patient, with 41 repeats, had ataxia and 
      spasticity. The two patients with cerebellar ataxia also had peripheral 
      neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with expanded CAG repeats can exhibit a 
      neuropathy-dominant phenotype not described previously. The novel 
      21-base-duplication mutant seems to share the aggregation properties of 
      polyglutamine-expanded mutants.

TI  - The Complex Genetic Landscape of Hereditary Ataxias in Turkey and Implications in 
      Clinical Practice.
PG  - 1676-1688
LID - 10.1002/mds.28518 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetic and epidemiological features of hereditary ataxias have 
      been reported in several populations; however, Turkey is still unexplored. Due to 
      high consanguinity, recessive ataxias are more common in Turkey than in Western 
      European populations. OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevalence and genetic structure 
      of hereditary ataxias in the Turkish population. METHODS: Our cohort consisted of 
      1296 index cases and 324 affected family members. Polymerase chain reaction 
      followed by Sanger sequencing or fragment analysis were performed to screen for 
      the trinucleotide repeat expansions in families with a dominant inheritance 
      pattern, as well as in sporadic cases. The expansion in the frataxin (FXN) gene 
      was tested in all autosomal recessive cases and in sporadic cases with a 
      compatible phenotype. Whole-exome sequencing was applied to 251 probands, 
      selected based on the family history, age of onset, and phenotype. RESULTS: 
      Mutations in known ataxia genes were identified in 30% of 1296 probands. 
      Friedreich's ataxia was found to be the most common recessive ataxia in Turkey, 
      followed by autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay. 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia types 2 and 1 were the most common dominant ataxias. 
      Whole-exome sequencing was performed in 251 probands with an approximate 
      diagnostic yield of 50%. Forty-eight novel variants were found in a plethora of 
      genes, suggesting a high heterogeneity. Variants of unknown significance were 
      discussed in light of clinical data. CONCLUSION: With the large sample size 
      recruited across the country, we consider that our results provide an accurate 
      picture of the frequency of hereditary ataxias in Turkey. (c) 2021 International

TI  - Body Mass Index Is Significantly Associated With Disease Severity in 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2 Patients.
PG  - 1372-1380
LID - 10.1002/mds.28498 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 is a progressive neurodegenerative 
      disorder due to an unstable expansion of a CAG repeat in the ATXN2 gene. Although 
      weight loss has been associated with disease progression in several 
      neurodegenerative conditions, it has been barely assessed in patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test 
      whether body mass index is altered in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      with varying expansion sizes from early to late disease stages. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional case-control study was performed, which included 222 clinically 
      and molecularly diagnosed patients and 214 sex- and age-matched healthy 
      individuals. ATXN2 genotypes and sex were considered as risk factors. Clinical 
      outcomes included the body mass index, age at onset, disease duration, Scale for 
      the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia score, disease stage, dysphagia, and 
      progression rate. Multiple linear regression models were generated. RESULTS: Body 
      mass index was significantly decreased in male patients, but not in female 
      patients, relative to control subjects. In addition to sex, body mass index was 
      significantly associated with age at onset and progression rate. Conversely, body 
      mass index, along with repeat length in ATXN2 expanded alleles and disease 
      duration, was associated with Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia 
      score. In addition, body mass index, along with the age at onset and the repeat 
      length in ATXN2 normal and expanded alleles, has a significant influence on 
      progression rate. CONCLUSIONS: Body mass index might be a useful biomarker of 
      disease severity, particularly in male patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      2 in the context of nutritional interventions or clinical trials assessing the 
      efficacy of promising new drugs. (c) 2021 International Parkinson and Movement

      atrophy.
PG  - 117-125

AB  - PURPOSE: Investigate single nucleotide variants and short tandem repeats in 39 
      genes related to spinocerebellar ataxia in clinical and pathologically defined 
      cohorts of multiple system atrophy. METHODS: Exome sequencing was conducted in 28 
      clinical multiple system atrophy patients to identify single nucleotide variants 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes. Novel variants were validated in two 
      independent disease cohorts: 86 clinically diagnosed multiple system atrophy 
      patients and 166 pathological multiple system atrophy cases. Expanded repeat 
      alleles in spinocerebellar ataxia genes were evaluated in 36 clinically diagnosed 
      multiple system atrophy patients, and CAG/CAA repeats in TATA-Box Binding Protein 
      (TBP, causative of SCA17) were screened in 216 clinical and pathological multiple 
      system atrophy patients and 346 controls. RESULTS: No known pathogenic 
      spinocerebellar ataxia single nucleotide variants or pathogenic range expanded 
      repeat alleles of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, AXTN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, 
      and TBP were detected in any clinical multiple system atrophy patients. However, 
      four novel variants were identified in four spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes 
      across three multiple system atrophy patients. Additionally, four multiple system 
      atrophy patients (1.6%) and one control (0.3%) carried an intermediate length 41 
      TBP CAG/CAA repeat allele (OR = 4.11, P = 0.21). There was a significant 
      association between the occurrence of a repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) and an increased risk of multiple system atrophy (OR = 1.64, P = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: Occurrence of TBP CAG/CAA repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) is significantly associated with increased multiple system atrophy risk. 
      This discovery warrants further investigation and supports a possible genetic 
      overlap of multiple system atrophy with SCA17.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Short tandem repeat (STR), or "microsatellite", is a tract of DNA in 
      which a specific motif (typically < 10 base pairs) is repeated multiple times. 
      STRs are abundant throughout the human genome, and specific repeat expansions may 
      be associated with human diseases. Long-read sequencing coupled with 
      bioinformatics tools enables the estimation of repeat counts for STRs. However, 
      with the exception of a few well-known disease-relevant STRs, normal ranges of 
      repeat counts for most STRs in human populations are not well known, preventing 
      the prioritization of STRs that may be associated with human diseases. RESULTS: 
      In this study, we extend a computational tool RepeatHMM to infer normal ranges of 
      432,604 STRs using 21 long-read sequencing datasets on human genomes, and build a 
      genomic-scale database called RepeatHMM-DB with normal repeat ranges for these 
      STRs. Evaluation on 13 well-known repeats show that the inferred repeat ranges 
      provide good estimation to repeat ranges reported in literature from 
      population-scale studies. This database, together with a repeat expansion 
      estimation tool such as RepeatHMM, enables genomic-scale scanning of repeat 
      regions in newly sequenced genomes to identify disease-relevant repeat 
      expansions. As a case study of using RepeatHMM-DB, we evaluate the CAG repeats of 
      ATXN3 for 20 patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) and 5 unaffected 
      individuals, and correctly classify each individual. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, 
      RepeatHMM-DB can facilitate prioritization and identification of disease-relevant 
      STRs from whole-genome long-read sequencing data on patients with undiagnosed 
      diseases. RepeatHMM-DB is incorporated into RepeatHMM and is available at 
      https://github.com/WGLab/RepeatHMM .

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 
      share a common molecular basis: both are associated with CAG-repeat expansion of 
      ATXN2 and TDP-43-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions. To date, the two 
      disorders are viewed as clinically distinct with ALS resulting from 30-33 
      CAG-repeats and SCA2 from >34 CAG-repeats. We describe a 67-year old with a 32 
      CAG-repeat expansion of ATXN2 who presented with simultaneous symptoms of ALS and 
      SCA2. Our case demonstrates that the clinical dichotomy between SCA2 and 
      ATXN2-ALS is false. We suggest instead that CAG-repeat expansion length 
      determines the timing of SCA2 clinical symptoms relative to onset of ALS; 
      consistent with this age of onset of SCA2 but not ATXN2-ALS, is dependent upon 
      expansion length. Review of the literature and our local cohort provides evidence 
      for occurrence of ALS in late stage SCA2, which may be under-recognised by 
      clinicians who think of the two diseases as distinct.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene encoding the ataxin-3 protein. 
      Despite extensive research the exact pathogenic mechanisms of SCA3 are still not 
      understood in depth. In the present study, to gain insight into the toxicity 
      induced by the expanded CAG repeats in SCA3, we comprehensively investigated 
      repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation in various cellular models expressing 
      translated or non-canonically translated ATXN3 sequences with an increasing 
      number of CAG repeats. We demonstrate that two SCA3 RAN proteins, polyglutamine 
      (polyQ) and polyalanine (polyA), are found only in the case of CAG repeats of 
      pathogenic length. Despite having distinct cellular localization, RAN polyQ and 
      RAN polyA proteins are very often coexpressed in the same cell, impairing nuclear 
      integrity and inducing apoptosis. We provide for the first time mechanistic 
      insights into SCA3 RAN translation indicating that ATXN3 sequences surrounding 
      the repeat region have an impact on SCA3 RAN translation initiation and 
      efficiency. We revealed that RAN translation of polyQ proteins starts at 
      non-cognate codons upstream of the CAG repeats, whereas RAN polyA proteins are 
      likely translated within repeats. Furthermore, integrated stress response 
      activation enhances SCA3 RAN translation. Our findings suggest that the ATXN3 
      sequence context plays an important role in triggering SCA3 RAN translation and 
      that SCA3 RAN proteins may cause cellular toxicity.

TI  - Toward allele-specific targeting therapy and pharmacodynamic marker for 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the 
      ataxin-3 gene (ATXN3), is characterized by neuronal polyglutamine (polyQ) ATXN3 
      protein aggregates. Although there is no cure for SCA3, gene-silencing approaches 
      to reduce toxic polyQ ATXN3 showed promise in preclinical models. However, a 
      major limitation in translating putative treatments for this rare disease to the 
      clinic is the lack of pharmacodynamic markers for use in clinical trials. Here, 
      we developed an immunoassay that readily detects polyQ ATXN3 proteins in human 
      biological fluids and discriminates patients with SCA3 from healthy controls and 
      individuals with other ataxias. We show that polyQ ATXN3 serves as a marker of 
      target engagement in human fibroblasts, which may bode well for its use in 
      clinical trials. Last, we identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism that 
      strongly associates with the expanded allele, thus providing an exciting drug 
      target to abrogate detrimental events initiated by mutant ATXN3. Gene-silencing 
      strategies for several repeat diseases are well under way, and our results are 
      expected to improve clinical trial preparedness for SCA3 therapies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), 
      the expanded cytosine adenine guanine (CAG) repeat in ATXN3 is the causal 
      mutation, and its length is the main factor in determining the age at onset (AO) 
      of clinical symptoms. However, the contribution of the expanded CAG repeat length 
      to the rate of disease progression after onset has remained a matter of debate, 
      even though an understanding of this factor is crucial for experimental data on 
      disease modifiers and their translation to clinical trials and their design. 
      METHODS: Eighty-two Dutch patients with SCA3/MJD were evaluated annually for 
      15 years using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). Using 
      linear growth curve models, ICARS progression rates were calculated and tested 
      for their relation to the length of the CAG repeat expansion and to the residual 
      age at onset (RAO): The difference between the observed AO and the AO predicted 
      on the basis of the CAG repeat length. RESULTS: On average, ICARS scores 
      increased 2.57 points/year of disease. The length of the CAG repeat was 
      positively correlated with a more rapid ICARS progression, explaining 30% of the 
      differences between patients. Combining both the length of the CAG repeat and RAO 
      as comodifiers explained up to 47% of the interpatient variation in ICARS 
      progression. INTERPRETATION: Our data imply that the length of the expanded CAG 
      repeat in ATXN3 is a major determinant of clinical decline, which suggests that 
      CAG-dependent molecular mechanisms similar to those responsible for disease onset 
      also contribute to the rate of disease progression in SCA3/MJD. ANN NEUROL

AB  - Establishing a molecular diagnosis in patients with progressive ataxia is often 
      challenging due to significant genetic and clinical heterogeneity and requires a 
      methodical approach with expert clinical evaluation and investigations. We 
      describe the 5-year experience of the National Ataxia Clinic (NAC), Ireland. All 
      adults with ataxia attending the NAC between 2014 and 2019 were evaluated. All 
      individuals underwent detailed clinical assessment and investigations including, 
      where appropriate, genetic testing using next-generation sequencing. For all 
      patients, acquired causes were ruled out. A total of 254 patients from 196 
      families were assessed; with growth of the clinic cohort by 82% from 133 to 242 
      over the 5-year period. The underlying genetic cause was identified in 128/196 
      probands (65.3%). The detection rate for repeat expansion disorder gene testing 
      was 47.7% (82/172) and using NGS gene panel, a genetic diagnosis was obtained in 
      30/84 (35.7%). Whole exome sequencing identified the molecular diagnosis in 4/20 
      (20%), and whole genome sequencing provided genetic diagnosis in 1/5 (20%). The 
      commonest diagnosis was Friedreich's ataxia (68/128, 53.1%). SPG7-associated 
      ataxia was the second most common diagnosis (21/128, 16.4%), followed by 
      ANO10-associated spastic ataxia, ataxia telangiectasia (AT), and other rarer 
      phenotypes. Our results highlight that careful clinical phenotyping in a 
      dedicated ataxia clinic is crucial for appropriate genetic testing in selected 
      patients in a timely manner. Advanced genetic testing has significantly improved 
      the diagnostic yield in patients with suspected genetic ataxia and should be 
      considered in all individuals with negative repeat expansion testing.

TI  - Patterns of CAG repeat instability in the central nervous system and periphery in 
      Huntington's disease and in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.
PG  - 2551-2567
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddaa139 [doi]
AB  - The expanded HTT CAG repeat causing Huntington's disease (HD) exhibits somatic 
      expansion proposed to drive the rate of disease onset by eliciting a pathological 
      process that ultimately claims vulnerable cells. To gain insight into somatic 
      expansion in humans, we performed comprehensive quantitative analyses of CAG 
      expansion in ~50 central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral postmortem tissues 
      from seven adult-onset and one juvenile-onset HD individual. We also assessed 
      ATXN1 CAG repeat expansion in brain regions of an individual with a 
      neurologically and pathologically distinct repeat expansion disorder, 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). Our findings reveal similar profiles of 
      tissue instability in all HD individuals, which, notably, were also apparent in 
      the SCA1 individual. CAG expansion was observed in all tissues, but to different 
      degrees, with multiple cortical regions and neostriatum tending to have the 
      greatest instability in the CNS, and liver in the periphery. These patterns 
      indicate different propensities for CAG expansion contributed by disease 
      locus-independent trans-factors and demonstrate that expansion per se is not 
      sufficient to cause cell type or disease-specific pathology. Rather, pathology 
      may reflect distinct toxic processes triggered by different repeat lengths across 
      cell types and diseases. We also find that the HTT CAG length-dependent expansion 
      propensity of an individual is reflected in all tissues and in cerebrospinal 
      fluid. Our data indicate that peripheral cells may be a useful source to measure 
      CAG expansion in biomarker assays for therapeutic efforts, prompting efforts to 
      dissect underlying mechanisms of expansion that may differ between the brain and 
      periphery.

AB  - Background: Short tandem repeats are an important source of genetic variation. 
      They are highly mutable and repeat expansions are associated dozens of human 
      disorders, such as Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxias. Technical 
      advantages in sequencing technology have made it possible to analyse these 
      repeats at large scale; however, accurate genotyping is still a challenging task. 
      We compared four different short tandem repeats genotyping tools on whole exome 
      sequencing data to determine their genotyping performance and limits, which will 
      aid other researchers in choosing a suitable tool and parameters for analysis. 
      Methods: The analysis was performed on the Simons Simplex Collection dataset, 
      where we used a novel method of evaluation with accuracy determined by the rate 
      of homozygous calls on the X chromosome of male samples. In total we analysed 433 
      samples and around a million genotypes for evaluating tools on whole exome 
      sequencing data. Results: We determined a relatively good performance of all 
      tools when genotyping repeats of 3-6 bp in length, which could be improved with 
      coverage and quality score filtering. However, genotyping homopolymers was 
      challenging for all tools and a high error rate was present across different 
      thresholds of coverage and quality scores. Interestingly, dinucleotide repeats 
      displayed a high error rate as well, which was found to be mainly caused by the 
      AC/TG repeats. Overall, LobSTR was able to make the most calls and was also the 
      fastest tool, while RepeatSeq and HipSTR exhibited the lowest heterozygous error 
      rate at low coverage. Conclusions: All tools have different strengths and 
      weaknesses and the choice may depend on the application. In this analysis we 
      demonstrated the effect of using different filtering parameters and offered 
      recommendations based on the trade-off between the best accuracy of genotyping 
      and the highest number of calls.

AB  - A recent genome-wide association study of Huntington disease (HD) implicated 
      genes involved in DNA maintenance processes as modifiers of onset, including 
      multiple genome-wide significant signals in a chr15 region containing the DNA 
      repair gene Fanconi-Associated Nuclease 1 (FAN1). Here, we have carried out 
      detailed genetic, molecular, and cellular investigation of the modifiers at this 
      locus. We find that missense changes within or near the DNA-binding domain 
      (p.Arg507His and p.Arg377Trp) reduce FAN1's DNA-binding activity and its capacity 
      to rescue mitomycin C-induced cytotoxicity, accounting for two infrequent 
      onset-hastening modifier signals. We also idenified a third onset-hastening 
      modifier signal whose mechanism of action remains uncertain but does not involve 
      an amino acid change in FAN1. We present additional evidence that a frequent 
      onset-delaying modifier signal does not alter FAN1 coding sequence but is 
      associated with increased FAN1 mRNA expression in the cerebral cortex. Consistent 
      with these findings and other cellular overexpression and/or suppression studies, 
      knockout of FAN1 increased CAG repeat expansion in HD-induced pluripotent stem 
      cells. Together, these studies support the process of somatic CAG repeat 
      expansion as a therapeutic target in HD, and they clearly indicate that multiple 
      genetic variations act by different means through FAN1 to influence HD onset in a 
      manner that is largely additive, except in the rare circumstance that two 
      onset-hastening alleles are present. Thus, an individual's particular combination 
      of FAN1 haplotypes may influence their suitability for HD clinical trials, 
      particularly if the therapeutic agent aims to reduce CAG repeat instability.

AB  - SAFB1 is a DNA and RNA binding protein that is highly expressed in the cerebellum 
      and hippocampus and is involved in the processing of coding and non-coding RNAs, 
      splicing and dendritic function. We analyzed SAFB1 expression in the post-mortem 
      brain tissue of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), Huntington's disease (HD), Multiple 
      sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease patients and controls. In SCA cases, the 
      expression of SAFB1 in the nucleus was increased and there was abnormal and 
      extensive expression in the cytoplasm where it co-localized with the markers of 
      Purkinje cell injury. Significantly, no SAFB1 expression was found in the 
      cerebellar neurons of the dentate nucleus in control or MS patients; however, in 
      SCA patients, SAFB1 expression was increased significantly in both the nucleus 
      and cytoplasm of dentate neurons. In HD, we found that SAFB1 expression was 
      increased in the nucleus and cytoplasm of striatal neurons; however, there was no 
      SAFB1 staining in the striatal neurons of controls. In PD substantia nigra, we 
      did not see any changes in neuronal SAFB1 expression. iCLIP analysis found that 
      SAFB1 crosslink sites within ATXN1 RNA were adjacent to the start and within the 
      glutamine repeat sequence. Further investigation found increased binding of SAFB1 
      to pathogenic ATXN1-85Q mRNA. These novel data strongly suggest SAFB1 contributes 
      to the etiology of SCA and Huntington's chorea and that it may be a pathological 
      marker of polyglutamine repeat expansion diseases.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a progressive genetic disorder caused 
      by ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat expansions in intron 9 of the ATXN10 gene. ATTCT 
      repeats have been reported to form unwound secondary structures which are likely 
      linked to large-scale repeat expansions. In this study, we performed 
      high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic investigations on DNA 
      sequences containing two to five ATTCT repeats. Strikingly, we found the first 
      two repeats of all these sequences well folded into highly compact minidumbbell 
      (MDB) structures. The 3D solution structure of the sequence containing two ATTCT 
      repeats was successfully determined, revealing the MDB comprises a regular TTCTA 
      and a quasi TTCT/A pentaloops with extensive stabilizing loop-loop interactions. 
      We further carried out in vitro primer extension assays to examine if the MDB 
      formed in the primer could escape from the proofreading function of DNA 
      polymerase. Results showed that when the MDB was formed at 5-bp or farther away 
      from the priming site, it was able to escape from the proofreading by Klenow 
      fragment of DNA polymerase I and thus retained in the primer. The intriguing 
      structural findings bring about new insights into the origin of genetic 
      instability in SCA10.

TI  - Rapid Diagnosis of Spinocerebellar Ataxia 36 in a Three-Generation Family Using 
      Short-Read Whole-Genome Sequencing Data.
PG  - 1675-1679

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias are often caused by expansions of short 
      tandem repeats. Recent methodological advances have made repeat expansion (RE) 
      detection with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) feasible. OBJECTIVES: The objective 
      of this study was to determine the genetic basis of ataxia in a multigenerational 
      Australian pedigree with autosomal-dominant inheritance. METHODS AND RESULTS: WGS 
      was performed on 3 affected relatives. The sequence data were screened for known 
      pathogenic REs using 2 RE detection tools: exSTRa and ExpansionHunter. This 
      screen provided a clear and rapid diagnosis (<5 days from receiving the 
      sequencing data) of spinocerebellar ataxia 36, a rare form of ataxia caused by an 
      intronic GGCCTG RE in NOP56. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of rare ataxias caused by 
      REs is highly feasible and cost-effective with WGS. We propose that WGS could 
      potentially be implemented as the frontline, cost-effective methodology for the

AB  - GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansions (HREs) in C9orf72 cause amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and lead to the 
      production of aggregating dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) via repeat associated 
      non-AUG (RAN) translation. Here, we show the similar intronic GGCCTG HREs that 
      causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36) is also translated into DPRs, 
      including poly(GP) and poly(PR). We demonstrate that poly(GP) is more abundant in 
      SCA36 compared to c9ALS/FTD patient tissue due to canonical AUG-mediated 
      translation from intron-retained GGCCTG repeat RNAs. However, the frequency of 
      the antisense RAN translation product poly(PR) is comparable between c9ALS/FTD 
      and SCA36 patient samples. Interestingly, in SCA36 patient tissue, poly(GP) 
      exists as a soluble species, and no TDP-43 pathology is present. We show that 
      aggregate-prone chimeric DPR (cDPR) species underlie the divergent DPR pathology 
      between c9ALS/FTD and SCA36. These findings reveal key differences in 
      translation, solubility, and protein aggregation of DPRs between c9ALS/FTD and 
      SCA36.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic familiar causes of oro-facial dyskinesia are usually 
      restricted to Huntington's disease, whereas other causes are often missed or 
      underestimated. Here, we report the case of late-onset oro-facial dyskinesia in 
      an elderly patient with a genetic diagnosis of Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 2 
      (SCA2). CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old man complained of progressive balance 
      difficulty since the age of 60 years, associated with involuntary movements of 
      the mouth and tongue over the last 3 months. No exposure to anti-dopaminergic 
      agents, other neuroleptics, antidepressants, or other drugs was reported. Family 
      history was positive for SCA2 (brother and the son of the brother). At rest, 
      involuntary movements of the mouth and tongue were noted; they appeared partially 
      suppressible and became more evident during stress and voluntary movements. 
      Cognitive examination revealed frontal-executive dysfunction, memory impairment, 
      and attention deficit. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed signs of 
      posterior periventricular chronic cerebrovascular disease and a marked 
      ponto-cerebellar atrophy, as confirmed by volumetric MRI analysis. A dopamine 
      transporter imaging scan demonstrated a bilaterally reduced putamen and caudate 
      nucleus uptake. Ataxin-2 (ATXN2) gene analysis revealed a 36 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansion, confirming the diagnosis of 
      SCA2. CONCLUSIONS: SCA2 should be considered among the possible causes of 
      adult-onset oro-facial dyskinesia, especially when the family history suggests an 
      inherited cerebellar disorder. Additional clinical features, including 
      parkinsonism and motor neuron disease, may represent relevant cues for an early 
      diagnosis and adequate management.

PG  - 1658-1672

AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) gene ATXN2 has a prominent role in the 
      pathogenesis and treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In addition to 
      cerebellar ataxia, motor neuron disease is often seen in SCA2, and ATXN2 CAG 
      repeat expansions in the long normal range increase ALS risk. Also, lowering 
      ATXN2 expression in TDP-43 ALS mice prolongs their survival. Here we investigated 
      the ATXN2 relationship with motor neuron dysfunction in vivo by comparing spinal 
      cord (SC) transcriptomes reported from TDP-43 and SOD1 ALS mice and ALS patients 
      with those from SCA2 mice. SC transcriptomes were determined using an SCA2 
      bacterial artificial chromosome mouse model expressing polyglutamine expanded 
      ATXN2. SCA2 cerebellar transcriptomes were also determined, and we also 
      investigated the modification of gene expression following treatment of SCA2 mice 
      with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) lowering ATXN2 expression. Differentially 
      expressed genes (DEGs) defined three interconnected pathways (innate immunity, 
      fatty acid biosynthesis and cholesterol biosynthesis) in separate modules 
      identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Other key pathways 
      included the complement system and lysosome/phagosome pathways. Of all DEGs in 
      SC, 12.6% were also dysregulated in the cerebellum. Treatment of mice with an 
      ATXN2 ASO also modified innate immunity, the complement system and 
      lysosome/phagosome pathways. This study provides new insights into the underlying 
      molecular basis of SCA2 SC phenotypes and demonstrates annotated pathways shared 
      with TDP-43 and SOD1 ALS mice and ALS patients. It also emphasizes the importance 
      of ATXN2 in motor neuron degeneration and confirms ATXN2 as a therapeutic target.

TI  - Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome in Costa da Morte Ataxia (SCA36).
PG  - 501-509
LID - 10.1007/s12311-020-01110-0 [doi]
AB  - SCA36 is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) affecting many 
      families from Costa da Morte, a northwestern region of Spain. It is caused by an 
      intronic GGCCTG repeat expansion in NOP56. In order to characterize the cognitive 
      and affective manifestations of this cerebellar disease, a group of 30 SCA36 
      mutation carriers (11 preataxic and 19 ataxic patients) were assessed with a 
      comprehensive battery of standardized tests. Phonological verbal fluency - but 
      not semantic fluency - was already mildly impaired in preataxic subjects. In 
      ataxic patients, both phonological and semantic fluencies were significantly 
      below normal. Depression, while more frequent and prominent in ataxic patients, 
      was also often present in the preataxic stage. This is the first systematic study 
      supporting the presence of a mild cerebellar cognitive and affective syndrome in 
      SCA36. Routine evaluation of cognitive and emotional spheres in SCA36 patients as 
      well as asymptomatic mutation carriers should allow early detection and timely 
      therapeutic intervention.

AB  - CAG-repeat expansions in at least eight different genes cause neurodegeneration. 
      The length of the extended polyglutamine stretches in the corresponding proteins 
      is proportionally related to their aggregation propensity. Although these 
      proteins are ubiquitously expressed, they predominantly cause toxicity to 
      neurons. To understand this neuronal hypersensitivity, we generated induced 
      pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and 
      Huntington's disease patients. iPSC generation and neuronal differentiation are 
      unaffected by polyglutamine proteins and show no spontaneous aggregate formation. 
      However, upon glutamate treatment, aggregates form in neurons but not in 
      patient-derived neural progenitors. During differentiation, the chaperone network 
      is drastically rewired, including loss of expression of the anti-amyloidogenic 
      chaperone DNAJB6. Upregulation of DNAJB6 in neurons antagonizes glutamate-induced 
      aggregation, while knockdown of DNAJB6 in progenitors results in spontaneous 
      polyglutamine aggregation. Loss of DNAJB6 expression upon differentiation is 
      confirmed in vivo, explaining why stem cells are intrinsically protected against 
      amyloidogenesis and protein aggregates are dominantly present in neurons.

TI  - Deficiency in classical nonhomologous end-joining-mediated repair of transcribed 
      genes is linked to SCA3 pathogenesis.
PG  - 8154-8165
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1917280117 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by CAG (encoding glutamine) repeat expansion in the Ataxin-3 
      (ATXN3) gene. We have shown previously that ATXN3-depleted or pathogenic 
      ATXN3-expressing cells abrogate polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP) 
      activity. Here, we report that ATXN3 associates with RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) 
      and the classical nonhomologous end-joining (C-NHEJ) proteins, including PNKP, 
      along with nascent RNAs under physiological conditions. Notably, ATXN3 depletion 
      significantly decreased global transcription, repair of transcribed genes, and 
      error-free double-strand break repair of a 3'-phosphate-containing terminally 
      gapped, linearized reporter plasmid. The missing sequence at the terminal break 
      site was restored in the recircularized plasmid in control cells by using the 
      endogenous homologous transcript as a template, indicating ATXN3's role in 
      PNKP-mediated error-free C-NHEJ. Furthermore, brain extracts from SCA3 patients 
      and mice show significantly lower PNKP activity, elevated p53BP1 level, more 
      abundant strand-breaks in the transcribed genes, and degradation of RNAP II 
      relative to controls. A similar RNAP II degradation is also evident in mutant 
      ATXN3-expressing Drosophila larval brains and eyes. Importantly, SCA3 phenotype 
      in Drosophila was completely amenable to PNKP complementation. Hence, salvaging 
      PNKP's activity can be a promising therapeutic strategy for SCA3.

AB  - Large expansions of microsatellite DNA cause several neurological diseases. In 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10), the repeat interruptions change disease 
      phenotype; an (ATTCC)n or a (ATCCT)n/(ATCCC)n interruption within the (ATTCT)n 
      repeat is associated with the robust phenotype of ataxia and epilepsy while 
      mostly pure (ATTCT)n may have reduced penetrance. Large repeat expansions of 
      SCA10, and many other microsatellite expansions, can exceed 10,000 base pairs 
      (bp) in size. Conventional next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are 
      ineffective in determining internal sequence contents or size of these expanded 
      repeats. Using repeat primed PCR (RP-PCR) in conjunction with a high-sensitivity 
      pulsed-field capillary electrophoresis fragment analyzer (FEMTO-Pulse, Agilent, 
      Santa Clara, CA) (RP-FEMTO hereafter), we successfully determined sequence 
      content of large expansion repeats in genomic DNA of SCA10 patients and 
      transformed yeast artificial chromosomes containing SCA10 repeats. This RP-FEMTO 
      is a simple and economical methodology which could complement emerging NGS for 
      very long sequence reads such as Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) and nanopore 
      sequencing technologies.

      Type 7.
LID - 10.3390/biom10030390 [doi]
LID - 390
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a neurodegenerative disease characterized 
      by cerebellar ataxia and retinal degeneration, is caused by an abnormal CAG 
      repeat expansion in the ATXN7 gene coding region. The onset and severity of SCA7 
      are highly variable between patients, thus identification of sensitive biomarkers 
      that accurately diagnose the disease and monitoring its progression are needed. 
      With the aim of identified SCA7-specific metabolites with clinical relevance, we 
      report for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, a metabolomics profiling 
      of circulating acylcarnitines and amino acids in SCA7 patients. We identified 21 
      metabolites with altered levels in SCA7 patients and determined two different 
      sets of metabolites with diagnostic power. The first signature of metabolites 
      (Valine, Leucine, and Tyrosine) has the ability to discriminate between SCA7 
      patients and healthy controls, while the second one (Methionine, 
      3-hydroxytetradecanoyl-carnitine, and 3-hydroxyoctadecanoyl-carnitine) possess 
      the capability to differentiate between early-onset and adult-onset patients, as 
      shown by the multivariate model and ROC analyses. Furthermore, enrichment 
      analyses of metabolic pathways suggest alterations in mitochondrial function, 
      energy metabolism, and fatty acid beta-oxidation in SCA7 patients. In summary, 
      circulating SCA7-specific metabolites identified in this study could serve as 
      effective predictors of SCA7 progression in the clinics, as they are sampled in 
      accessible biofluid and assessed by a relatively simple biochemical assay.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is a great deal of heterogeneity, both phenotypically and 
      genotypically among the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA). Their 
      prevalence also varies in different populations. Trinucleotide repeat expansions 
      (CTG/CAG) have been shown predominantly to cause a number of ADCAs. AIM: The 
      present study describes the frequency of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) and the 
      CAG repeat sizes among the different regions of India. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: 
      Molecular data from our central reference laboratory were retrospectively 
      analyzed for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, 17 and DRPLA. Correlation between age at 
      diagnosis and the CAG repeats of the expanded and the normal alleles were tested 
      with the Spearman correlation test. RESULTS: The presence of SCAs vary according 
      to geographical regions and ethnicities; SCA 12 was detected with the highest 
      frequency (229/901), but was restricted to a specific ethnic population, followed 
      by SCA 2 with a positivity of 12% (101/845). SCA 3 previously known as 
      Machado-Joseph Disease had a prevalence of 4.05% (32/789), whereas SCA 1 was 
      diagnosed in 30/773 (3.88%). No positivity was seen for SCA 10 from the 103 
      samples tested and for SCA 17 from the 131 samples tested either as a part of an 
      extended panel or stand-alone. CONCLUSION: In this report, we are able to expand 
      the portrait of SCAs in India by presenting the largest ever molecular data from 
      a central reference laboratory.

TI  - Live births following preimplantation genetic testing for dynamic mutation 
      diseases by karyomapping: a report of three cases.
PG  - 539-548
LID - 10.1007/s10815-020-01718-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic defects (PGT-M) is a 
      beneficial strategy for the patients suffering from a Mendelian disease, which 
      could protect their offspring from inheriting the disease. The purpose of this 
      study is to report the effectiveness of PGT-M based on karyomapping for three 
      cases of dynamic mutation diseases with trinucleotide repeat expansion. METHODS: 
      PGT-M was carried out on three couples, whose family members were diagnosed with 
      Huntington's disease or spinocerebellar ataxias 2 or 12. The whole genome 
      amplification was obtained using the multiple displacement amplification (MDA) 
      method. Then, karyomapping was performed to detect the allele that is carrying 
      the trinucleotide repeat expansion using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
      linkage analyses, and the copy number variations (CNVs) of the embryos were also 
      identified. Prenatal diagnosis was performed to validate the accuracy of PGT-M. 
      RESULTS: PGT-M was successfully performed on the three couples, and they accepted 
      the transfers of euploid blastocysts without the relevant pathogenic allele. The 
      clinical pregnancies were acquired and the prenatal diagnosis of the three 
      families confirmed the effectiveness of karyomapping. The three born babies were 
      healthy and free of the pathogenic alleles HTT, ATXN2, or PPP2R2B corresponding 
      to Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxias 2 or 12, respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: This study shows that karyomapping is a highly powerful and efficient 
      approach for dynamic mutation detection in preimplantation embryos. In this work, 
      we first report the birth of healthy babies that are free of the pathogenic gene 
      for dynamic mutation diseases in patients receiving PGT-M by karyomapping.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1-2-17 
      (SCA1-2-17) are adult-onset autosomal dominant diseases, caused by triplet repeat 
      expansions in the HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, and TBP genes. Alleles with a repeat number 
      just below the pathological threshold are associated with reduced penetrance and 
      meiotic instability and are defined as intermediate alleles (IAs). OBJECTIVES: We 
      aimed to determine the frequencies of IAs in healthy Italian subjects and to 
      compare the proportion of the IAs with the prevalence of the respective diseases. 
      METHODS: We analyzed the triplet repeat size in HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, and TBP genes 
      in the DNA samples from 729 consecutive adult healthy Italian subjects. RESULTS: 
      IAs associated with reduced penetrance were found in ATXN2 gene (1 subject, 0.1%) 
      and TBP gene (0.82%). IAs at risk for meiotic instability were found in HTT 
      (5.3%) and ATXN2 genes (2.7%). In ATXN1, we found a low percentage of IAs (0.4%). 
      Alleles lacking the common CAT interruption within the CAG sequence were also 
      rare (0.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The high frequencies of IAs in HTT and ATXN2 genes 
      suggest a correlation with the prevalence of the diseases in our population and 
      support the hypothesis that IAs could represent a reservoir of new pathological 
      expansions. On the opposite, ATXN1-IA were very rare in respect to the prevalence 
      of SCA1 in our country, and TBP- IA were more frequent than expected, suggesting 
      that other mechanisms could influence the occurrence of novel pathological 
      expansions.

AB  - Genetic testing for neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) is highly challenging 
      because of genetic heterogeneity and overlapping manifestations. Targeted-gene 
      panels (TGPs), coupled with next-generation sequencing (NGS), can facilitate the 
      profiling of a large repertoire of ND-related genes. Due to the technical 
      limitations inherent in NGS and TGPs, short tandem repeat (STR) variations are 
      often ignored. However, STR expansions are known to cause such NDs as 
      Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxias type 3 (SCA3). Here, we studied 
      the clinical utility of a custom-made TGP that targets 199 NDs and 311 
      ND-associated genes on 118 undiagnosed patients. At least one known or likely 
      pathogenic variation was found in 54 patients; 27 patients demonstrated clinical 
      profiles that matched the variants; and 16 patients whose original diagnosis were 
      refined. A high concordance of variant calling were observed when comparing the 
      results from TGP and whole-exome sequencing of four patients. Our in-house STR 
      detection algorithm has reached a specificity of 0.88 and a sensitivity of 0.82 
      in our SCA3 cohort. This study also uncovered a trove of novel and recurrent 
      variants that may enrich the repertoire of ND-related genetic markers. We propose 
      that a combined comprehensive TGPs-bioinformatics pipeline can improve the 
      clinical diagnosis of NDs.

      spinocerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 363-369
LID - 10.1038/s10038-019-0717-y [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a genetically heterogeneous disease characterized 
      by cerebellar ataxia. Many causative genes have been identified to date, the most 
      common etiology being the abnormal expansion of repeat sequences, and the 
      mutation of ion channel genes also play an important role in the development of 
      SCA. Some of them encode calcium and potassium channels. However, due to limited 
      reports about potassium genes in SCA, we screened 192 Japanese individuals with 
      dominantly inherited SCA who had no abnormal repeat expansions of causative genes 
      for potassium channel mutations (KCNC3 for SCA13 and KCND3 for SCA19/SCA22) by 
      target sequencing. As a result, two variants were identified from two patients: 
      c.1973G>A, p.R658Q and c.1018G>A, p.V340M for KCNC3, and no pathogenic variant 
      was identified for KCND3. The newly identified p.V340M exists in the 
      extracellular domain, and p.R658Q exists in the intracellular domain on the 
      C-terminal side, although most of the reported KCNC3 mutations are present at the 
      transmembrane site. Adult-onset and slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia are the 
      main clinical features of SCA13 and SCA19 caused by potassium channel mutations, 
      which was similar in our cases. SCA13 caused by KCNC3 mutations may present with 
      deep sensory loss and cognitive impairment in addition to cerebellar ataxia. In 
      this study, mild deep sensory loss was observed in one case. SCA caused by 
      potassium channel gene mutations is extremely rare, and more cases should be 
      accumulated in the future to elucidate its pathogenesis due to channel 
      dysfunction.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), a rare polyglutamine neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin-2 gene, exhibits common 
      cellular phenotypes with other neurodegenerative disorders, including oxidative 
      stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we show that SCA2 patient cells 
      exhibit higher levels of caspase-8- and caspase-9-mediated apoptotic activation 
      than control cells, cellular phenotypes that we find to be exacerbated by 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibition of autophagy. We also suggest that 
      oligomerization of mutant ataxin-2 protein is likely to be the cause of the 
      observed cellular phenotypes by causing inhibition of autophagy and by inducing 
      ROS generation. Finally, we show that removal of ataxin-2 oligomers, either by 
      increasing autophagic clearance or by oligomer dissolution, appears to alleviate 
      the cellular phenotypes. Our results suggest that oligomerized ataxin-2 and 
      oxidative stress affect autophagic clearance in SCA2 cells, contributing to the 
      pathophysiology, and that activation of autophagy or clearance of oligomers may 
      prove to be effective therapeutic strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      due to a CAG-repeat expansion. This work is intended to identify modifiers of the 
      clinical phenotype in SCA2, following up on recent genome-wide association 
      analyses that demonstrated the prominent role of DNA-damage repair and 
      methylation for the severity and progression of polyglutamine diseases. In 
      particular, we assessed the impact of MTHFR as rate-limiting enzyme in DNA 
      methylation pathways, which modulates cerebellar neurotransmission and motor 
      neuron atrophy. METHODS: A sample of 166 Cuban SCA2 patients and of 130 healthy 
      subjects from the same geographical and ethnic background was selected. The ATXN2 
      CAG repeat length was determined by PCR followed by polyacrylamide gel 
      electrophoresis. Two amino acid substitutions known to decrease the enzyme 
      activity of MTHFR, encoded by C677T and A1298C polymorphisms, were assessed by 
      PCR/RFLP. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed for C677T or A1298C 
      alleles or genotype frequencies between cases and controls, confirming that 
      disease risk in SCA2 does not depend on MTHFR activity. However, MTHFR A1298C 
      genotypes showed a significant association with saccade latency. CONCLUSIONS: 
      \MTHFR A1298C polymorphism is associated with saccade latency in SCA2 patients, 
      but not with disease risk, age at onset or maximal saccade velocity. These 
      results provide evidence that folate-mediated one...carbon metabolism might be 
      important in the physiopathology of SCA2.

AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 3 (SCA3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease) is a 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion encoding an 
      abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the disease protein, ataxin-3 
      (ATXN3). No preventive treatment is yet available for SCA3. Because SCA3 is 
      likely caused by a toxic gain of ATXN3 function, a rational therapeutic strategy 
      is to reduce mutant ATXN3 levels by targeting pathways that control its 
      production or stability. Here, we sought to identify genes that modulate ATXN3 
      levels as potential therapeutic targets in this fatal disorder. We screened a 
      collection of siRNAs targeting 2742 druggable human genes using a cell-based 
      assay based on luminescence readout of polyQ-expanded ATXN3. From 317 candidate 
      genes identified in the primary screen, 100 genes were selected for validation. 
      Among the 33 genes confirmed in secondary assays, 15 were validated in an 
      independent cell model as modulators of pathogenic ATXN3 protein levels. Ten of 
      these genes were then assessed in a Drosophila model of SCA3, and one was 
      confirmed as a key modulator of physiological ATXN3 abundance in SCA3 neuronal 
      progenitor cells. Among the 15 genes shown to modulate ATXN3 in mammalian cells, 
      orthologs of CHD4, FBXL3, HR and MC3R regulate mutant ATXN3-mediated toxicity in 
      fly eyes. Further mechanistic studies of one of these genes, FBXL3, encoding a 
      F-box protein that is a component of the SKP1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase 
      complex, showed that it reduces levels of normal and pathogenic ATXN3 in SCA3 
      neuronal progenitor cells, primarily via a SCF complex-dependent manner. 
      Bioinformatic analysis of the 15 genes revealed a potential molecular network 
      with connections to tumor necrosis factor-alpha/nuclear factor-kappa B (TNF/NF-kB) 
      and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathways. Overall, we 
      identified 15 druggable genes with diverse functions to be suppressors or 
      enhancers of pathogenic ATXN3 abundance. Among identified pathways highlighted by 
      this screen, the FBXL3/SCF axis represents a novel molecular pathway that 
      regulates physiological levels of ATXN3 protein.

TI  - Cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome preceding ataxia associated with complex 
      extrapyramidal features in a Turkish SCA48 family.
PG  - 51-58
LID - 10.1007/s10048-019-00595-0 [doi]
AB  - SCA48 is a novel spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) originally and recently 
      characterized by prominent cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome (CCAS) and 
      late-onset ataxia caused by mutations on the STUB1 gene. Here, we report the 
      first SCA48 case from Turkey with novel clinical features and diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI) findings, used for the first time to evaluate a SCA48 patient. A 
      65-year-old female patient with slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, cognitive 
      impairment, behavioral changes, and a vertical family history was evaluated. 
      Following the exclusion of repeat expansion ataxias, whole exome sequencing (WES) 
      was performed. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including DTI, and 
      single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were used to study the 
      primarily affected tracts and regions. WES revealed the previously reported 
      heterozygous truncating mutation in ubiquitin ligase domain of STUB1 
      (ENST00000219548:c.823_824delCT, ENSP00000219548:p.L275Dfs*16) leading to a 
      frameshift. Patient's cognitive status was compatible with CCAS. Novel clinical 
      features different from the original report include later onset chorea, dystonia, 
      general slowness of movements, apraxia, and palilalia, some of which have been 
      recently reported in two families with different STUB1 mutations. CCAS is a 
      prominent and often early feature of SCA48 which may be followed years after the 
      onset of the disease by other complex neurological signs and symptoms. DTI may be 
      helpful for demonstrating the cerebello-frontal tracts, involved in 
      CCAS-associated SCA48, the differential diagnosis of which may be challenging 
      especially in its early years.

      variation underlying intellectual disability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since different types of genetic variants, from single nucleotide 
      variants (SNVs) to large chromosomal rearrangements, underlie intellectual 
      disability, we evaluated the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) rather than 
      chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) as a first-line genetic diagnostic test. 
      METHODS: We analyzed three cohorts with short-read WGS: (i) a retrospective 
      cohort with validated copy number variants (CNVs) (cohort 1, n = 68), (ii) 
      individuals referred for monogenic multi-gene panels (cohort 2, n = 156), and 
      (iii) 100 prospective, consecutive cases referred to our center for CMA (cohort 
      3). Bioinformatic tools developed include FindSV, SVDB, Rhocall, Rhoviz, and 
      vcf2cytosure. RESULTS: First, we validated our structural variant (SV)-calling 
      pipeline on cohort 1, consisting of three trisomies and 79 deletions and 
      duplications with a median size of 850 kb (min 500 bp, max 155 Mb). All variants 
      were detected. Second, we utilized the same pipeline in cohort 2 and analyzed 
      with monogenic WGS panels, increasing the diagnostic yield to 8%. Next, cohort 3 
      was analyzed by both CMA and WGS. The WGS data was processed for large (> 10 kb) 
      SVs genome-wide and for exonic SVs and SNVs in a panel of 887 genes linked to 
      intellectual disability as well as genes matched to patient-specific Human 
      Phenotype Ontology (HPO) phenotypes. This yielded a total of 25 pathogenic 
      variants (SNVs or SVs), of which 12 were detected by CMA as well. We also applied 
      short tandem repeat (STR) expansion detection and discovered one pathologic 
      expansion in ATXN7. Finally, a case of Prader-Willi syndrome with uniparental 
      disomy (UPD) was validated in the WGS data. Important positional information was 
      obtained in all cohorts. Remarkably, 7% of the analyzed cases harbored complex 
      structural variants, as exemplified by a ring chromosome and two duplications 
      found to be an insertional translocation and part of a cryptic unbalanced 
      translocation, respectively. CONCLUSION: The overall diagnostic rate of 27% was 
      more than doubled compared to clinical microarray (12%). Using WGS, we detected a 
      wide range of SVs with high accuracy. Since the WGS data also allowed for 
      analysis of SNVs, UPD, and STRs, it represents a powerful comprehensive genetic 
      test in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting.

TI  - A diagnostic ceiling for exome sequencing in cerebellar ataxia and related 
      neurological disorders.
PG  - 487-501
LID - 10.1002/humu.23946 [doi]
AB  - Genetic ataxias are associated with mutations in hundreds of genes with high 
      phenotypic overlap complicating the clinical diagnosis. Whole-exome sequencing 
      (WES) has increased the overall diagnostic rate considerably. However, the upper 
      limit of this method remains ill-defined, hindering efforts to address the 
      remaining diagnostic gap. To further assess the role of rare coding variation in 
      ataxic disorders, we reanalyzed our previously published exome cohort of 76 
      predominantly adult and sporadic-onset patients, expanded the total number of 
      cases to 260, and introduced analyses for copy number variation and repeat 
      expansion in a representative subset. For new cases (n = 184), our resulting 
      clinically relevant detection rate remained stable at 47% with 24% classified as 
      pathogenic. Reanalysis of the previously sequenced 76 patients modestly improved 
      the pathogenic rate by 7%. For the combined cohort (n = 260), the total observed 
      clinical detection rate was 52% with 25% classified as pathogenic. Published 
      studies of similar neurological phenotypes report comparable rates. This 
      consistency across multiple cohorts suggests that, despite continued technical 
      and analytical advancements, an approximately 50% diagnostic rate marks a 
      relative ceiling for current WES-based methods and a more comprehensive 
      genome-wide assessment is needed to identify the missing causative genetic 
      etiologies for cerebellar ataxia and related neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion within the ATXN3/MJD1 gene. The 
      expanded CAG repeats encode a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract at the C-terminus of 
      the ATXN3 protein. ATXN3 containing expanded polyQ forms aggregates, leading to 
      subsequent cellular dysfunctions including an impaired ubiquitin-proteasome 
      system (UPS). To investigate the pathogenesis of SCA3 and develop potential 
      therapeutic strategies, we established induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines 
      from SCA3 patients (SCA3-iPSC). Neurons derived from SCA3-iPSCs formed aggregates 
      that are positive to the polyQ marker 1C2. Treatment with the proteasome 
      inhibitor, MG132, on SCA3-iPSC-derived neurons downregulated proteasome activity, 
      increased production of radical oxygen species (ROS), and upregulated the cleaved 
      caspase 3 level and caspase 3 activity. This increased susceptibility to the 
      proteasome inhibitor can be rescued by a Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) extract 
      NH037 (from Pueraria lobata) and its constituent daidzein via upregulating 
      proteasome activity and reducing protein ubiquitination, oxidative stress, 
      cleaved caspase 3 level, and caspase 3 activity. Our results successfully 
      recapitulate the key phenotypes of the neurons derived from SCA3 patients, as 
      well as indicate the potential of NH037 and daidzein in the treatment for SCA3 
      patients.

AB  - Different interrupted repeat expansions have been found in several trinucleotide 
      repeat (TNR) diseases such as fragile X syndrome (FXS), spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs), and myotonic dystrophies (DMs). Their origins and roles remain poorly 
      understood, especially in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). We present here the 
      triplet repeat primed polymerase chain reaction (TP-PCR) and restriction 
      enzyme-digested PCR to detect and identify interrupted triplet repeat alleles in 
      DM1. TP-PCR consists of a PCR amplification using a fluoresceinated (FAM) primer 
      flanking the repeat region and a primer pair in CTG.CAG repeats. A detailed 
      analysis of interrupted triplet repeat tracts is essential to fully understand 
      the role of interruptions in the pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms observed 
      in TNR diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dystonia is a relatively common feature of spinocerebellar ataxia 3 
      (SCA3). Childhood onset of SCA3 is rare and typically associated with either 
      relatively large, or homozygous, CAG repeat expansions. CASE REPORT: We describe 
      a 10-year-old girl with SCA3, who presented with tongue dystonia in addition to 
      limb dystonia and gait ataxia due to a heterozygous expansion of 84 repeats in 
      ATXN3. DISCUSSION: Diagnosis of the SCAs can be challenging, and even more so in 
      children. Tongue dystonia has not previously been documented in SCA3.

AB  - Although the heritability of cognitive function in old age is substantial, 
      genome-wide association studies have had limited success in elucidating its 
      genetic basis, leaving a considerable amount of "missing heritability." Aside 
      from single nucleotide polymorphisms, genome-wide association studies are unable 
      to assess other large sources of genetic variation, such as tandem repeat 
      polymorphisms. Therefore, here, we studied the association of 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat variations in polyglutamine 
      disease-associated genes (PDAGs) with cognitive function in older adults. In a 
      large cohort consisting of 5786 participants, we found that the CAG repeat number 
      in 3 PDAGs (TBP, HTT, and AR) were significantly associated with the decline in 
      cognitive function, which together accounted for 0.49% of the variation. 
      Furthermore, in an magnetic resonance imaging substudy, we found that CAG repeat 
      polymorphisms in 4 PDAGs (ATXN2, CACNA1A, ATXN7, and AR) were associated with 
      different imaging characteristics, including brain stem, putamen, globus 
      pallidus, thalamus, and amygdala volumes. Our findings indicate that tandem 
      repeat polymorphisms are associated with cognitive function in older adults and 
      highlight the importance of PDAGs in elucidating its missing heritability.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a hereditary 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by repeat expansions in the ATXN10 gene. 
      Patients present with cerebellar ataxia frequently accompanied by seizures. Even 
      though loss of cerebellar Purkinje neurons has been described, its brain 
      degeneration pattern is unknown. Our aim was to characterize the gray and white 
      matter degeneration patterns in SCA10 patients and the association with clinical 
      features. METHODS: We enrolled 18 patients with molecular diagnosis of SCA10 and 
      18 healthy individuals matched for age and sex. All participants underwent brain 
      MRI including high-resolution anatomical and diffusion images. Whole-brain 
      Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) and Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) were 
      performed to identify white and grey matter degeneration respectively. A second 
      analysis in the cerebellum identified the unbiased pattern of degeneration. Motor 
      impairment was assessed using the SARA Scale. RESULTS: TBSS analysis in the 
      patient group revealed white matter atrophy exclusively in the cerebellum. VBM 
      analysis showed extensive grey matter degeneration in the cerebellum, brainstem, 
      thalamus, and putamen. Significant associations between cerebellar degeneration 
      and SARA scores were found. Additionally, degeneration in thalamic GM and WM in 
      the cerebellar lobule VI were significantly associated with the presence of 
      seizures. CONCLUSION: The results show that besides cerebellum and brainstem, 
      brain degeneration in SCA10 includes predominantly the putamen and thalamus; 
      involvement of the latter is strongly associated with seizures. Analysis of the 
      unbiased degeneration pattern in the cerebellum suggests lobules VIIIb, IX, and X 
      as the primary cerebellar targets of the disease, which expands to the anterior 
      lobe in later stages.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a fatal, late-onset neurodegenerative 
      disorder characterized by selective neuropathology in the brainstem, cerebellum, 
      spinal cord, and substantia nigra. Here we report the first NIH-approved human 
      embryonic stem cell (hESC) line derived from an embryo harboring the SCA3 
      mutation. Referred to as SCA3-hESC, this line is heterozygous for the mutant 
      polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. We observed 
      relevant molecular hallmarks of the human disease at all differentiation stages 
      from stem cells to cortical neurons, including robust ATXN3 aggregation and 
      altered expression of key components of the protein quality control machinery. In 
      addition, SCA3-hESCs exhibit nuclear accumulation of mutant ATXN3 and form 
      p62-positive aggresomes. Finally, antisense oligonucleotide-mediated reduction of 
      ATXN3 markedly suppressed aggresome formation. The SCA3-hESC line offers a unique 
      and highly relevant human disease model that holds strong potential to advance 
      understanding of SCA3 disease mechanisms and facilitate the evaluation of 
      candidate therapies for SCA3.

TI  - ATXN10 Microsatellite Distribution in a Peruvian Amerindian Population.
PG  - 841-848
LID - 10.1007/s12311-019-01057-x [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a repeat expansion disease occurring 
      mostly in Latin America, suggesting that the mutation spread with the peopling of 
      the Americas, or that Amerindian populations, have a higher ATXN10 mutability. 
      High frequency of large normal alleles is associated with prevalence and relative 
      frequency of other repeat expansion diseases. To test whether the allele 
      distribution of the SCA10-causing ATXN10 microsatellite in an Amerindian Peruvian 
      population differs from that of other populations. The ATXN10 allele distribution 
      in a Quechua Peruvian population from Puno, Peru, is similar to that of Finland. 
      Mean allele size and mode were also similar to those of Mexico, Japan, and white 
      Europeans. ATXN10 allele distribution in a healthy Amerindian population from 
      Peru does not differ from that of other populations.

TI  - Noncoding CGG repeat expansions in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease, 
      oculopharyngodistal myopathy and an overlapping disease.
PG  - 1222-1232
LID - 10.1038/s41588-019-0458-z [doi]
AB  - Noncoding repeat expansions cause various neuromuscular diseases, including 
      myotonic dystrophies, fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome, some spinocerebellar 
      ataxias, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and benign adult familial myoclonic 
      epilepsies. Inspired by the striking similarities in the clinical and 
      neuroimaging findings between neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) and 
      fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome caused by noncoding CGG repeat expansions in 
      FMR1, we directly searched for repeat expansion mutations and identified 
      noncoding CGG repeat expansions in NBPF19 (NOTCH2NLC) as the causative mutations 
      for NIID. Further prompted by the similarities in the clinical and neuroimaging 
      findings with NIID, we identified similar noncoding CGG repeat expansions in two 
      other diseases: oculopharyngeal myopathy with leukoencephalopathy and 
      oculopharyngodistal myopathy, in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 and LRP12, respectively. 
      These findings expand our knowledge of the clinical spectra of diseases caused by 
      expansions of the same repeat motif, and further highlight how directly searching 
      for expanded repeats can help identify mutations underlying diseases.

AB  - The most commonly inherited dominant ataxia, Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 
      (SCA3), is caused by a CAG repeat expansion that encodes an abnormally long 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat in the disease protein ataxin-3, a deubiquitinase. 
      Two major full-length isoforms of ataxin-3 exist, both of which contain the same 
      N-terminal portion and polyQ repeat, but differ in their C-termini; one (denoted 
      here as isoform 1) contains a motif that binds ataxin-3's substrate, ubiquitin, 
      whereas the other (denoted here as isoform 2) has a hydrophobic tail. Most SCA3 
      studies have focused on isoform 1, the predominant version in mammalian brain, 
      yet both isoforms are present in brain and a better understanding of their 
      relative pathogenicity in vivo is needed. We took advantage of the fruit fly, 
      Drosophila melanogaster to model SCA3 and to examine the toxicity of each 
      ataxin-3 isoform. Our assays reveal isoform 1 to be markedly more toxic than 
      isoform 2 in all fly tissues. Reduced toxicity from isoform 2 is due to much 
      lower protein levels as a result of its expedited degradation. Additional studies 
      indicate that isoform 1 is more aggregation-prone than isoform 2 and that the 
      C-terminus of isoform 2 is critical for its enhanced proteasomal degradation. 
      According to our results, although both full-length, pathogenic ataxin-3 isoforms 
      are toxic, isoform 1 is likely the primary contributor to SCA3 due to its 
      presence at higher levels. Isoform 2, as a result of rapid degradation that is 
      dictated by its tail, is unlikely to be a key player in this disease. Our 
      findings provide new insight into the biology of this ataxia and the cellular 
      processing of the underlying disease protein.

TI  - Treadmill training increases the motor activity and neuron survival of the 
      cerebellum in a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1 (SCA1) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder 
      that is characterized by worsening of disordered coordination, ataxia of the 
      trunk, and other neurological symptoms. Physical activity improves both mobility 
      and the daily living activities of patients with SCA. Intervention with daily 
      regular treadmill exercise may slow the deterioration of cerebellar neurons in 
      SCA1. Therefore, the signal changes and performance of cerebellar neurons after 
      exercise in SCA1 was investigated in this study. We employed a transgenic mouse 
      model of SCA1, generated by amplifying the cytosine-adenine-guanine trinucleotide 
      repeat expansions, and the mice underwent 1 month of moderate daily treadmill 
      exercise for 1 hour. The rotarod test revealed that the motor function of the 
      SCA1 mice that underwent training was superior to that of the control SCA1 mice, 
      which did not undergo training. Moreover, the cerebellar pathology revealed 
      preserved Purkinje neurons stained by carbindin with an increase of the neuronal 
      Per Arnt Sim domain protein 4, a key regulation in the structural and functional 
      plasticity of neurons, in the excised SCA1 mice relative to the controls. The 
      mechanism was related to an increase of phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, 
      a downstream target of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, but not to 
      autophagy activation. This study determined that regular treadmill exercise may 
      play a crucial role in the viable support of cerebellar neurons in SCA1.

TI  - Macular degeneration as a common cause of visual loss in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 1 (SCA1) patients.
PG  - 49-53
LID - 10.1080/13816810.2019.1571614 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) caused by pathogenic CAG repeat 
      expansion in the ATXN1 is characterized by loss of vision with little fundus 
      abnormalities in some patients. Recently, macular degeneration has been reported 
      to account for the visual symptoms in sporadic cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five 
      consecutive patients diagnosed as SCA1 with supporting genetical evidence were 
      newly referred to ophthalmology department from neurology unit. They underwent 
      ocular examination to assess visual acuity and the structural integrity of the 
      macula using optical coherent tomography (OCT). Full-field and multifocal 
      electroretinogram (ERG) were recorded in some patients. Genetic testing was done 
      by a polymerase chain reaction-based method. RESULTS: Fundus examinations 
      revealed normal optic disc and macula appearance. However, four out of five 
      patients had foveal thinning by OCT. This included three patients who showed 
      reduced visual acuity. Among the three, multifocal ERG was performed in two, 
      which showed reduced amplitudes in the localized foveal area. Full-field ERG 
      showed normal responses in all five patients assessed. Only one patient had 
      normal visual function and normal macular structure. CONCLUSIONS: Macular 
      degeneration with subtle funduscopic alterations, sometimes mimicking occult 
      macular dystrophy, is an important cause of visual loss in SCA1 patients, which 
      could be reliably detected with OCT and multifocal ERGs.

TI  - Wide Profiling of Circulating MicroRNAs in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 7.
PG  - 6106-6120
LID - 10.1007/s12035-019-1480-y [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a neurodegenerative disease characterized 
      by cerebellar ataxia and retinal degeneration, is caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the ATXN7 gene coding region. Disease onset and progression are 
      highly variable between patients, thus identification of specific/sensitive 
      biomarkers that can improve the monitoring of disease progression is an immediate 
      need. Because altered expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) has been shown 
      in various neurological diseases, they could be useful biomarkers for SCA7. In 
      this study, we showed, to our knowledge for the first time, the expression 
      profile of circulating miRNAs in SCA7. Using the TaqMan profiling low density 
      array (TLDA), we found 71 differentially expressed miRNAs in the plasma of SCA7 
      patients, compared with healthy controls. The reliability of TLDA data was 
      validated independently by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in an 
      independent cohort of patients and controls. We identified four validated miRNAs 
      that possesses the diagnostic value to discriminate between healthy controls and 
      patients (hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-let7e-5p, hsa-miR-18a-5p, and hsa-miR-30b-5p). The 
      target genes of these four miRNAs were significantly enriched in cellular 
      processes that are relevant to central nervous system function, including 
      Fas-mediated cell-death, heparansulfate biosynthesis, and 
      soluble-N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor activating protein receptor pathways. 
      Finally, we identify a signature of four miRNAs associated with disease severity 
      that discriminate between early onset and adult onset, highlighting their 
      potential utility to surveillance disease progression. In summary, circulating 
      miRNAs might provide accessible biomarkers for disease stage and progression and 
      help to identify novel cellular processes involved in SCA7.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a retinal-cerebellar degenerative 
      disorder caused by CAG-polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansions in the ataxin-7 
      gene. As many SCA7 clinical phenotypes occur in mitochondrial disorders, and 
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy of patients revealed altered energy metabolism, 
      we considered a role for mitochondrial dysfunction. Studies of SCA7 mice 
      uncovered marked impairments in oxygen consumption and respiratory exchange. When 
      we examined cerebellar Purkinje cells in mice, we observed mitochondrial network 
      abnormalities, with enlarged mitochondria upon ultrastructural analysis. We 
      developed stem cell models from patients and created stem cell knockout rescue 
      systems, documenting mitochondrial morphology defects, impaired oxidative 
      metabolism, and reduced expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) 
      production enzymes in SCA7 models. We observed NAD(+) reductions in mitochondria 
      of SCA7 patient NPCs using ratiometric fluorescent sensors and documented 
      alterations in tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism in patients. Our results indicate 
      that mitochondrial dysfunction, stemming from decreased NAD(+), is a defining 
      feature of SCA7.

TI  - FipoQ/FBXO33, a Cullin-1-based ubiquitin ligase complex component modulates 
      ubiquitination and solubility of polyglutamine disease protein.
PG  - 781-798

AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases describe a group of progressive neurodegenerative 
      disorders caused by the CAG triplet repeat expansion in the coding region of the 
      disease genes. To date, nine such diseases, including spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3 (SCA3), have been reported. The formation of SDS-insoluble protein aggregates 
      in neurons causes cellular dysfunctions, such as impairment of the 
      ubiquitin-proteasome system, and contributes to polyQ pathologies. Recently, the 
      E3 ubiquitin ligases, which govern substrate specificity of the 
      ubiquitin-proteasome system, have been implicated in polyQ pathogenesis. The 
      Cullin (Cul) proteins are major components of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases 
      (CRLs) complexes that are evolutionarily conserved in the Drosophila genome. In 
      this study, we examined the effect of individual Culs on SCA3 pathogenesis and 
      found that the knockdown of Cul1 expression enhances SCA3-induced 
      neurodegeneration and reduces the solubility of expanded SCA3-polyQ proteins. The 
      F-box proteins are substrate receptors of Cul1-based CRL. We further performed a 
      genetic modifier screen of the 19 Drosophila F-box genes and identified F-box 
      involved in polyQ pathogenesis (FipoQ) as a genetic modifier of SCA3 degeneration 
      that modulates the ubiquitination and solubility of expanded SCA3-polyQ proteins. 
      In the human SK-N-MC cell model, we identified that F-box only protein 33 
      (FBXO33) exerts similar functions as FipoQ in modulating the ubiquitination and 
      solubility of expanded SCA3-polyQ proteins. Taken together, our study 
      demonstrates that Cul1-based CRL and its associated F-box protein, FipoQ/FBXO33, 
      modify SCA3 protein toxicity. These findings will lead to a better understanding 
      of the disease mechanism of SCA3 and provide insights for developing treatments 
      against SCA3. Cover Image for this issue: doi: 10.1111/jnc.14510.

TI  - Autosomal Dominant Gene Negative Frontotemporal Dementia-Think of SCA17.
PG  - 654-658
LID - 10.1007/s12311-018-0998-2 [doi]
AB  - SCA 17 is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder caused by TBP gene CAG/CAA repeat 
      expansion. Ataxia and dementia are common. The presence of frontal dysfunction at 
      outset of the disease may mimic frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Parkinsonism, 
      chorea, dystonia, and pyramidal signs may occur. We report an Irish family with 
      autosomal dominant partially penetrant frontal dementia with cerebellar atrophy 
      due to SCA17 and present detailed neuropsychological assessment for the first 
      time. A 44-year-old doctor presented with 18-month history of behavioral 
      problems. She slowed down, became apathetic, and unable to multitask. She became 
      more irritable and short tempered, and her work performance deteriorated. Brain 
      MRI showed cerebellar atrophy and cerebellar hypometabolism was noted on FDG-PET. 
      A sister developed personality changes at age 45 with apathy, and had problems 
      with memory and social skills; another sister at age 39 became dysarthric and 
      unsteady. A brother at age 52 demonstrated emotional lability, and became 
      dysarthric, unsteady, and slowed down. Their mother aged 73 had an abnormal 
      antalgic gait due to arthritis; their father was jocular and disinhibited. MAPT 
      testing detected an exon 9 c.726C>T variant in the proband. Subsequent testing in 
      nine siblings and both parents failed to show co-segregation with disease. SCA17 
      testing revealed a TBP gene 43 repeat expansion that co-segregated in all 
      affected siblings and in the mother whose gait problems were initially attributed 
      to arthritis. In over 80% of cases of FTD with clear autosomal dominant 
      inheritance, causative gene defects involve MAPT, GRN, or C9orf72 mutations. A 
      minority involves VCP, FUS, and CHMP2B. As evident from our case, SCA17 testing 
      should also be considered, especially if cerebellar atrophy if found on imaging. 
      Segregation analysis is crucial. MAPT variant (c.726C>T exon 9) detected in the 
      family was deemed a polymorphism.

AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominant disease 
      characterized by progressive degeneration of the cerebellum, brain stem, and 
      spinal cord. SCA2 is caused by spontaneous misfolding and aggregate formation 
      from abnormal CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the coding region of the 
      ATXN2 gene. Here we describe the generation of two distinct iPSC lines from 
      patients with SCA2.

AB  - A hexanucleotide GGCCTG repeat expansion in intron 1 of the nucleolar protein 56 
      gene causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36), which is a relatively pure 
      cerebellar ataxia with progressive motor neuron involvement. In this study SCA36 
      cell models were generated by introducing expanded GGCCTG/CAGGCC repeats into 
      cultured Neuro2A cells. Sense (GGCCUG)(exp) but not antisense (CAGGCC)(exp) RNA 
      foci were detected in the cells, consistent with observations in autopsied brains 
      of patients with SCA36. Glycine-proline dipeptide repeat (DPR) formation due to 
      repeat-associated non-ATG translation rarely occurred in cells expressing 
      expanded GGCCTG repeats; in contrast, cells harboring expanded c9orf72 
      GGGGCC/GGCCCC repeats robustly expressed DPR proteins. There are currently no 
      effective treatments for microsatellite repeat expansion diseases including 
      SCA36. In order to identify potentially useful therapies, we screened five 
      candidate chemical compounds for their ability to diminish the toxicity of 
      expanded SCA36 repeats and evaluated whether small interfering RNA-mediated 
      silencing of Supt4a/Supt5, the murine ortholog of the yeast transcriptional 
      elongation factor Spt4/Spt5, has therapeutic potential based on RNA foci 
      quantification and cytotoxicity assays. Supt4a knockdown and erythromycin 
      treatment suppressed the formation of (GGCCUG)(exp) RNA foci and DPR protein 
      formation via regulation of (GGCCUG)(exp) mRNA, thereby ameliorating the 
      cytotoxicity in SCA36 cell models. These data provide a basis for developing 
      effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of SCA36 and other repeat 
      expansion disorders.

AB  - DNA methylation has been reported as an important regulator of genomic structure 
      stability, including large tandem repeats. To test the modulation effect of 
      variants in DNA methylation-related genes on distribution of expanded (CAG)(n) 
      alleles and age at onset (AO) of patients with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), we 
      conducted an association analysis on 23 selected SNPs in these genes in 613 
      patients with MJD and 581 controls. There were significant differences in the 
      distribution of rs12957023 between patients and controls (OR = 1.296, p = 0.007 
      and OR = 1.206, p = 0.008, for genotype and alleles, respectively). The 
      distribution of (CAG)(n) size was also different between patients carrying a CC 
      and the other genotypes (TT and TC, p = 0.011 for expanded (CAG)(n) and p = 0.012 
      for normal size alleles), indicating that DNA methylation might modulate the 
      (CAG)(n) instability. We found also that rs13420827 in DNMT3A and rs7354779 in 
      DNMT3L contribute to AO of MJD (p = 0.019 and p = 0.008, respectively). In 
      conclusion, our data provide the first evidence that SNPs in DNA 
      methylation-related genes may contribute to (CAG)(n) instability and modulate the 
      AO of this disease.

TI  - Antisense oligonucleotides targeting mutant Ataxin-7 restore visual function in a 
      mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 7.
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.aap8677 [doi]
LID - eaap8677
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder characterized by cerebellar and retinal degeneration, and is caused by a 
      CAG-polyglutamine repeat expansion in the ATAXIN-7 gene. Patients with SCA7 
      develop progressive cone-rod dystrophy, typically resulting in blindness. 
      Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are single-stranded chemically modified nucleic 
      acids designed to mediate the destruction, prevent the translation, or modify the 
      processing of targeted RNAs. Here, we evaluated ASOs as treatments for SCA7 
      retinal degeneration in representative mouse models of the disease after 
      injection into the vitreous humor of the eye. Using Ataxin-7 aggregation, visual 
      function, retinal histopathology, gene expression, and epigenetic dysregulation 
      as outcome measures, we found that ASO-mediated Ataxin-7 knockdown yielded 
      improvements in treated SCA7 mice. In SCA7 mice with retinal disease, 
      intravitreal injection of Ataxin-7 ASOs also improved visual function despite 
      initiating treatment after symptom onset. Using color fundus photography and 
      autofluorescence imaging, we also determined the nature of retinal degeneration 
      in human SCA7 patients. We observed variable disease severity and cataloged 
      rapidly progressive retinal degeneration. Given the accessibility of neural 
      retina, availability of objective, quantitative readouts for monitoring 
      therapeutic response, and the rapid disease progression in SCA7, ASOs targeting 
      ATAXIN-7 might represent a viable treatment for SCA7 retinal degeneration.

AB  - Intermediate-length ATXN2 CAG repeats are a risk factor for amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS). Here we report on a female patient with heterozygous repeat 
      expansion mutation in the CACNA1A gene presenting with a pure ALS syndrome while 
      her father, who also carries that CACNA1A mutation, suffers from a classical 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 6. Hypothesizing that CACNA1A CAG repeat expansions 
      could be a monogenic cause for familial ALS (fALS), we analyzed the CAG repeat 
      lengths in CACNA1A in a large cohort of genetically unexplained patients with 
      fALS. Our results indicate that CAG repeat expansion mutations in CACNA1A are not 
      a frequent monogenic cause of fALS but could phenotypically present as ALS in 
      rare instances.

AB  - A unique consanguineous family with 2 genomic instability disorders, Fanconi 
      anemia and ataxia telangiectasia, revealed exceptional combinations of null 
      mutations in the FANCA and ATM genes. Two siblings with Fanconi anemia had novel

      adjoined to upstream 65 nucleotide direct tandem repeats and deletion hotspot 
      motifs in the FANCA gene. The sibling with ataxia telangiectasia revealed a 
      homozygous p.Arg2993Stop (c.8977C>T) null mutation in the ATM gene. All patients 
      were also heterozygous for the opposite mutations without any additional clinical 
      or laboratory manifestations. Double heterozygote parents did not present any 
      clinical symptoms suggestive of the 2 disorders.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in ATXN1, characterized by progressive cerebellar and 
      extracerebellar symptoms. MRI-based studies in SCA1 focused in the cerebellum and 
      connections, but there are few data about supratentorial/spinal damage and its 
      clinical relevance. We have thus designed this multimodal MRI study to uncover 
      the structural signature of SCA1. To accomplish that, a group of 33 patients and 
      33 age-and gender-matched healthy controls underwent MRI on a 3T scanner. All 
      patients underwent a comprehensive neurological and neuropsychological 
      evaluation. We correlated the structural findings with the clinical features of 
      the disease. In addition, we evaluated the disease progression looking at 
      differences in SCA1 subgroups defined by disease duration. Ataxia and pyramidal 
      signs were the main symptoms. Neuropsychological evaluation disclosed cognitive 
      impairment in 53% with predominant frontotemporal dysfunction. Gray matter 
      analysis unfolded cortical thinning of primary and associative motor areas with 
      more restricted impairment of deep structures. Deep gray matter atrophy was 
      associated with motor handicap and poor cognition skills. White matter integrity 
      loss was diffuse in the brainstem but restricted in supratentorial structures. 
      Cerebellar cortical thinning was found in multiple areas and correlated not only 
      with motor disability but also with verbal fluency. Spinal cord atrophy 
      correlated with motor handicap. Comparison of MRI findings in disease 
      duration-defined subgroups identified a peculiar pattern of progressive 
      degeneration.

      correlations with cortical volumes.

AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 7 (SCA7) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansion. It is clinically characterized 
      by ataxia and visual loss. To date, little is known about SCA7 cognitive 
      impairments and its relationship with grey matter volume (GMV) changes. The aim 
      of this study was to explore SCA7 patients' performance in specific components of 
      auditory-verbal neuropsychological tests and to correlate their scores with 
      genetic mutation, severity of ataxia and GMV. We assessed verbal memory and 
      verbal fluency proficiencies in 31 genetically confirmed SCA7 patients, and 
      compared their results with 32 healthy matched volunteers; we also correlated CAG 
      repeats and severity of motor symptoms with performance in the auditory-verbal 
      tests. SCA7 patients exhibited deficiencies in several components of these 
      cognitive tasks, which were independent of motor impairments and showed no 
      relation to CAG repeats. Based on Resonance Images performed in 27 patients we 
      found association between ataxia severity and GMV in "sensoriomotor" cerebellum, 
      as well as correlations of impaired verbal memory and semantic fluency scores 
      with GMV in association cortices, including the right parahippocampal gyrus. To 
      our knowledge, this is the first report of deficits in the organization of 
      semantic information and in the evocation of verbal material, as well as greater 
      susceptibility to proactive interference in SCA7 patients. These findings bring 
      novel information about specific cognitive abilities in SCA7 patients, 
      particularly verbal memory and fluency, and their relation with GMV variations in 
      circumscribed brain regions, including association cortices known to have 
      functional relationships with the cerebellum.

TI  - The long non-coding RNA NEAT1 is elevated in polyglutamine repeat expansion 
      diseases and protects from disease gene-dependent toxicities.
PG  - 4303-4314
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddy331 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat diseases are a class of neurodegenerative disorders 
      caused by CAG-repeat expansion. There are diverse cellular mechanisms behind the 
      pathogenesis of polyQ disorders, including transcriptional dysregulation. 
      Interestingly, we find that levels of the long isoform of nuclear paraspeckle 
      assembly transcript 1 (Neat1L) are elevated in the brains of mouse models of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 7 and Huntington's disease (HD). Neat1L was 
      also elevated in differentiated striatal neurons derived from HD knock-in mice 
      and in HD patient brains. The elevation was mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) dependent, 
      as knockdown of mHTT in vitro and in vivo restored Neat1L to normal levels. In 
      additional studies, we found that Neat1L is repressed by methyl CpG binding 
      protein 2 (MeCP2) by RNA-protein interaction but not by occupancy of MeCP2 at its 
      promoter. We also found that NEAT1L overexpression protects from mHTT-induced 
      cytotoxicity, while reducing it enhanced mHTT-dependent toxicity. Gene set 
      enrichment analysis of previously published RNA sequencing data from mouse 
      embryonic fibroblasts and cells derived from HD patients shows that loss of 
      NEAT1L impairs multiple cellular functions, including pathways involved in cell 
      proliferation and development. Intriguingly, the genes dysregulated in HD human 
      brain samples overlap with pathways affected by a reduction in NEAT1, confirming 
      the correlation of NEAT1L and HD-induced perturbations. Cumulatively, the role of 
      NEAT1L in polyQ disease model systems and human tissues suggests that it may play 
      a protective role in CAG-repeat expansion diseases.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type-12 (SCA12) is a neurological disorder caused due to 
      triplet (CAG) repeat expansion in 5' UTR of PPP2R2B. It is one of the most 
      prominent SCA-subtype in Indian population and till date no patient specific 
      models have been described. Human-induced-pluripotent-stem cell (HiPSC) based 
      disease modelling has become the next generation tool for studying various human 
      pathologies. In the present study we established three SCA12 patient specific 
      iPSC lines. All the generated lines have shown pluripotency markers, normal 
      karyotype, in-vitro three germ layers differentiation potential, vector 
      clearance, SCA12 mutation, parental genomic identity and contamination free 
      culture.

TI  - Age at onset prediction in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 changes according to 
      population of origin.
PG  - 113-120
LID - 10.1111/ene.13779 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease 
      (SCA3/MJD), the length of CAG repeat expansions in ATXN3 shows an inverse 
      correlation with age at onset (AO). Recently, a formula for predicting AO based 
      on CAG expansion was developed for European carriers. We tested this formula in 
      SCA3/MJD carriers from distinct origins and developed population-specific models 
      to predict AO. METHODS: This was a parametric survival modelling study. RESULTS: 
      The European formula (EF) was tested in 739 independent SCA3/MJD carriers from 
      South Brazil, Taiwan and the Portuguese Azorean islands, and it largely 
      underestimated AO in South Brazilian and Taiwanese test cohorts. This finding 
      challenged the universal use of the EF, leading us to develop and validate 
      population-specific models for AO prediction. Using validation cohorts, we showed 
      that Brazilian and Taiwanese formulas largely outperformed the EF in a 
      population-specific manner. Inversely, the EF was more accurate at predicting AO 
      among Portuguese Azorean patients. Hence, specific prediction models were 
      required for each SCA3/MJD ethnic group. CONCLUSIONS: Our data strongly support 
      the existence of as yet unknown factors that modulate AO in SCA3/MJD in a 
      population-dependent manner, independent of CAG expansion length. The generated 
      models are made available to the scientific community as they can be useful for 
      future studies on SCA3/MJD carriers from distinct geographical origins.

AB  - Genetic testing strategies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels and 
      whole genome sequencing (WGS) can be applied to the hereditary cerebellar ataxias 
      (HCAs), but their exact role in the diagnostic pathway is unclear. We aim to 
      determine the yield from genetic testing strategies and the genetic and 
      phenotypic spectrum of HCA in Australia by analysing real-world data. We 
      performed a retrospective review on 87 HCA cases referred to the Neurogenetics 
      Clinic at the Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, Australia. Probands underwent 
      triplet repeat expansion testing; those that tested negative had NGS-targeted 
      panels and WGS testing when available. In our sample, 58.6% were male (51/87), 
      with an average age at onset of 37.1 years. Individuals with sequencing variants 
      had a prolonged duration of illness compared to those with a triplet repeat 
      expansion. The detection rate in probands for routine repeat expansion panels was 
      13.8% (11/80). NGS-targeted panels yielded a further 11 individuals (11/32, 
      34.4%), with WGS yielding 1 more diagnosis (1/3, 33.3%). NGS panels and WGS 
      improved the overall diagnostic rate to 28.8% (23/80) in 14 known HCA loci. The 
      genetic findings included novel variants in ANO10, CACNA1A, PRKCG and SPG7. Our 
      findings highlight the genetic heterogeneity of HCAs and support the use of NGS 
      approaches for individuals who were negative on repeat expansion testing. In 
      comparison to repeat disorders, individuals with sequencing variants may have a 
      prolonged duration of illness, consistent with slower progression of disease.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To study the long-term evolution of patient-reported outcome 
      measures (PROMs) in the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), we analyzed 
      8 years follow-up data of the EUROSCA Natural History Study, a cohort study of 
      526 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6. METHODS: To assess the functional 
      capacity in daily living, we used the functional assessment (part IV) of the 
      Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS-IV), for health-related quality 
      of life the visual analogue scale of the EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire 
      (EQ-5D VAS), and for depressive symptoms the Patient Health Questionnaire 
      (PHQ-9). Severity of ataxia was assessed using the Scale for the Assessment and 
      Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and neurological symptoms other than ataxia with the 
      Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS). RESULTS: UHDRS-IV [SCA1: - 1.35 (0.12); 
      SCA2: - 1.15 (0.11); SCA3: - 1.16 (0.11); SCA6: - 0.99 (0.12)] and EQ-5D [SCA1: 
      - 2.88 (0.72); SCA2: - 1.97 (0.49); SCA3: - 2.06 (0.55); SCA6: - 1.03 (0.57)] 
      decreased linearly, whereas PHQ-9 increased [SCA1: 0.15 (0.04); SCA2: 0.09 
      (0.03); SCA3: 0.06 (0.04); SCA6: 0.07 (0.04)] during the observational period. 
      Standard response means (SRMs) of UHDRS-IV (0.473-0.707) and EQ-5D VAS 
      (0.053-0.184) were lower than that of SARA (0.404-0.979). In SCA1, higher SARA 
      scores [- 0.0288 (0.01), p = 0.0251], longer repeat expansions [- 0.0622 (0.02), 
      p = 0.0002] and the presence of cognitive impairment at baseline [- 0.5381 
      (0.25), p = 0.0365] were associated with faster UHDRS-IV decline. In SCA3, higher 
      INAS counts were associated with a faster UHDRS-IV decline [- 0.05 (0.02), 
      p = 0.0212]. In SCA1, PHQ-9 progression was faster in patients with cognitive 
      impairment [0.14 (0.07); p = 0.0396]. CONCLUSIONS: In the common SCAs, PROMs give 
      complementary information to the information provided by neurological scales. 
      This underlines the importance of PROMs as additional outcome measures in future 
      interventional trials.

AB  - A skin biopsy of a patient with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3, also known 
      as Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)) caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      in the ATXN3 gene, was used to generate an induced pluripotent stem cell line, 
      HIHCNi002-A (iPSC-SCA3). Skin fibroblasts were reprogrammed using episomal 
      plasmids carrying hOCT4, hSOX2, hKLF4, hL-MYC, and hLIN28. The iPSC-SCA3 line 
      exhibits chromosomal stability with conservation of the ATXN3 repeat expansion, 
      expresses pluripotency markers and differentiates into endo-, meso-, and 
      ectodermal cells in vitro.

TI  - Olfactory Function in SCA10.
PG  - 85-90
LID - 10.1007/s12311-018-0954-1 [doi]
AB  - Although the main clinical manifestations of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) 
      result from damage of the cerebellum, other systems may also be involved. 
      Olfactory deficits have been reported in other types of ataxias, especially in 
      SCA3; however, there are no studies on olfactory deficits in SCA type 10 (SCA10). 
      To analyze olfactory function of SCA10 patients compared with that of SCA3, 
      Parkinson's, and healthy controls. Olfactory identification was tested in three 
      groups of 30 patients (SCA10, SCA3, and Parkinson's disease (PD)) and 44 healthy 
      controls using the Sniffin' Sticks (SS16) test. Mean SS16 score was 11.9 +/- 2.9 
      for the SCA10 group, 12.3 +/- 1.9 for the SCA3 group, 6.6 +/- 2.8 for the PD group, 
      and 12.1 +/- 2.0 for the control group. Mean SS16 score for the SCA10 group was not 
      significantly different from the scores for the SCA3 and control groups but was 
      significantly higher than the score for the PD group (p < 0.001) when adjusted 
      for age, gender, and history of smoking. There was no association between SS16 
      scores and disease duration in the SCA10 or SCA3 groups or number of repeat 
      expansions. SS16 and Mini Mental State Examination scores were correlated in the 
      three groups: SCA10 group (r = 0.59, p = 0.001), SCA3 group (r = 0.50, 
      p = 0.005), and control group (r = 0.40, p = 0.007). We found no significant 
      olfactory deficits in SCA10 in this large series.

TI  - A study of Huntington disease-like syndromes in black South African patients 
      reveals a single SCA2 mutation and a unique distribution of normal alleles across 
      five repeat loci.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, characterised 
      by a triad of movement disorder, emotional and behavioural disturbances and 
      cognitive impairment. The underlying cause is an expanded CAG repeat in the 
      huntingtin gene. For a small proportion of patients presenting with HD-like 
      symptoms, the mutation in this gene is not identified and they are said to have a 
      HD "phenocopy". South Africa has the highest number of recorded cases of an 
      African-specific phenocopy, Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2), caused by a repeat 
      expansion in the junctophilin-3 gene. However, a significant proportion of black 
      patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of HD still test negative for HD and 
      HDL2. This study thus aimed to investigate five other loci associated with HD 
      phenocopy syndromes - ATN1, ATXN2, ATXN7, TBP and C9orf72. In a sample of 
      patients in whom HD and HDL2 had been excluded, a single expansion was identified 
      in the ATXN2 gene, confirming a diagnosis of Spinocerebellar ataxia 2. The 
      results indicate that common repeat expansion disorders do not contribute 
      significantly to the HD-like phenotype in black South African patients. 
      Importantly, allele sizing reveals unique distributions of normal repeat lengths 
      across the associated loci in the African population studied.

TI  - Homozygote of spinocerebellar Ataxia type 3 correlating with severe phenotype 
      based on analyses of clinical features.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most common subtype of 
      SCAs worldwide. SCA3 homozygote is defined as expanded CAG repeats in both 
      alleles that might exhibit severe phenotype due to gene dosage effect. However, a 
      study on the systematic comparison of clinical phenotypes between homozygotes and 
      heterozygotes to indicate these verity of phenotypes of homozygotes is still 
      lacking. METHODS: A total of 14 SCA3 homozygotes (3 Chinese participants and 11 
      participants from various ethnicity in different published studies) and 143 
      Chinese heterozygotes of SCA3 were recruited for this study. The 95% confidence 
      intervals (CIs) of age at onset and disease severity expected from heterozygous 
      patients were analyzed to detect the phenotypic differences between homozygotes 
      and heterozygotes. RESULTS: Almost all the homozygotes (13 of 14) were found to 
      present a significant earlier age at onset compared with heterozygotes, because 
      age at onset of most homozygotes was lower than the 95% CIs of age at onset of 
      heterozygotes. Also, the clinical severity in most of the homozygotes (3 of 4) 
      with identified clinical phenotypes was higher than the 95% CIs of severity in 
      heterozygotes, indicating more severe clinical phenotypes in SCA3 homozygotes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The homozygosity for SCA3 could lead to an earlier age of onset and 
      putative severe clinical features. The findings of the present study suggested an 
      influence of gene dosage on SCA3 phenotypes.

PG  - 1618-1624
LID - 10.1007/s00415-018-8893-9 [doi]
AB  - Blood biomarkers in degenerative ataxias are still largely missing. Here, we 
      aimed to provide piloting proof-of-concept that serum Neurofilament light (NfL) 
      could offer a promising peripheral blood biomarker in degenerative ataxias. 
      Specifically, as a marker of neuronal damage, NfL might (1) help to differentiate 
      multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type (MSA-C) from sporadic adult-onset 
      ataxia (SAOA), and (2) show increases in repeat-expansion spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs) which might be amenable to treatment in the future. To explore these two 
      hypotheses, we measured serum NfL levels by single-molecule array (Simoa) 
      technique in 115 subjects, comprising patients with MSA-C (n = 25), SAOA 
      (n = 25), the most frequent repeat-expansion SCAs (SCA 1, 2, 3 and 6) (n = 20), 
      and age-matched controls (n = 45). Compared to controls, NfL was significantly 
      increased in MSA-C, with levels significantly higher than in SAOA (AUC = 0.74 
      (0.59-0.89), mean and 95% confidence interval, p = .004). NfL was also 
      significantly increased in SCA patients as compared to controls (AUC = 0.91 
      (0.81-1.00), p < .001), including NfL increases in SCA1 and SCA3. These findings 
      provide first proof-of-concept that NfL might provide a promising peripheral 
      biomarker in degenerative ataxias, e.g. supporting the differentiation of MSA-C 
      from SAOA, and indicating neuronal damage in repeat-expansion SCAs.

TI  - Genetic testing for clinically suspected spinocerebellar ataxias: report from a 
      tertiary referral centre in India.
PG  - 219-224
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      syndromes, characterized by a wide range of muscular weakness and motor deficits, 
      caused due to cerebellar degeneration. The prevalence of the syndromes of SCA 
      varies across the world and is known to be linked to the instability of 
      trinucleotide repeats within the high-end normal alleles, along with susceptible 
      haplotype. We estimated sizes of the CAG or GAA repeat expansions at the SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA12 and frataxin loci among 864 referrals of subjects to genetic 
      counselling and testing (GCAT) clinic, National Institute of Mental Health and 
      Neurosciences, Bengaluru, India, with suspected SCA. The most frequent mutations 
      detected were SCA1 (n = 100 (11.6%)) and SCA2 (n = 98 (11.3%)) followed by SCA3 
      (n = 40 (4.6%)), FRDA (n = 20 (2.3%)) and SCA12 (n = 8 (0.9%)).

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 8 of the ATXN1 gene. We generated 
      induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from a SCA1 patient and his non-affected 
      sister by using non-integrating Sendai Viruses (SeV). The resulting hiPSCs are 
      SeVfree, express pluripotency markers, display a normal karyotype, retain the 
      mutation (length of the CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN1 gene) and are able to 
      differentiate into the three germ layers in vitro.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7, associated with a (CAG)(n) 
      repeat expansion in coding sequences, are the most prevalent autosomal dominant 
      ataxias worldwide (approximately 60% of the cases). In addition, the phenotype of 
      SCA2 expansions has been now extended to Parkinson disease and amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis. Their diagnosis is currently based on a PCR to identify small 
      expanded alleles, followed by a second-level test whenever a false normal 
      homozygous or a CAT interruption in SCA1 needs to be verified. Next-generation 
      sequencing still does not allow efficient detection of these repeats. Here, we 
      show the efficacy of a novel, rapid, and cost-effective method to identify and 
      size pathogenic expansions in SCA1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 and recognize large alleles or 
      interruptions without a second-level test. Twenty-five healthy controls and 33 
      expansion carriers were analyzed: alleles migrated consistently in different PCRs 
      and capillary runs, and homozygous individuals were always distinguishable from 
      heterozygous carriers of both common and large (>100 repeats) pathogenic CAG 
      expansions. Repeat number could be calculated counting the number of peaks, 
      except for the largest SCA2 and SCA7 alleles. Interruptions in SCA1 were always 
      visible. Overall, our method allows a simpler, cost-effective, and sensibly 
      faster SCA diagnostic protocol compared with the standard technique and to the 
      still unadapted next-generation sequencing.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the region of the ATXN3 gene. The 
      main feature of SCA3 is progressive ataxia, which affects balance, gait, and 
      speech. Urine cells (UCs) of a SCA3 patient were successfully translated to 
      induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by using the Sendai virus delivery system. 
      ZZUi004-A cell line may provide a robust platform for further study of SCA3 
      pathogenesis as well as drug testing and gene therapy research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) subtypes are often caused by expansions 
      in non-coding regions of genes like SCA8, SCA10, SCA12 and SCA36. Other ataxias 
      are known to be associated with repeat expansions such as fragile X-associated 
      tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) or expansions in the C9orf72 gene. When no 
      mutation has been identified in the aforementioned genes next-generation 
      sequencing (NGS)-based diagnostics may also be applied. In order to define an 
      optimal diagnostic strategy, more information about the frequency and phenotypic 
      characteristics of rare repeat expansion disorders associated with ataxia should 
      be at hand. METHODS: We analyzed a consecutive cohort of 440 German unrelated 
      patients with symptoms of cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria and other unspecific 
      symptoms who were referred to our center for SCA diagnostics. They showed alleles 
      in the normal range for the most common SCA subtypes SCA1-3, SCA6, SCA7 and 
      SCA17. These patients were screened for expansions causing SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA36 and FXTAS as well as for the pathogenic hexanucleotide repeat in the 
      C9orf72 gene. RESULTS: Expanded repeats for SCA10, SCA12 or SCA36 were not 
      identified in the analyzed patients. Five patients showed expanded SCA8 CTA/CTG 
      alleles with 92-129 repeats. One 51-year-old male with unclear dementia symptoms 
      was diagnosed with a large GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72. The analysis of 
      the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) revealed one patient with a 
      premutation (>50 CGG repeats) and seven patients with alleles in the grey zone 
      (41 to 54 CGG repeats). CONCLUSIONS: Altogether five patients showed 92 or more 
      SCA8 CTA/CTG combined repeats. Our results support the assumption that smaller 
      FMR1 gene expansions could be associated with the risk of developing neurological 
      signs. The results do not support genetic testing for C9orf72 expansion in ataxia 
      patients.

AB  - Cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansions in the coding regions of nine 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) genes (HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATN1, AR, 
      and TBP) are the cause of several neurodegenerative diseases including 
      Huntington's disease (HD), six different spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. The 
      expanded CAG repeat length in the causative gene is negatively related to the 
      age-at-onset (AAO) of clinical symptoms. In addition to the expanded CAG repeat 
      length in the causative gene, the normal CAG repeats in the other polyQ genes can 
      affect the AAO, suggesting functional interactions between the polyQ genes. 
      However, there is no detailed assessment of the relationships among polyQ genes 
      in pathologically relevant brain regions. We used gene co-expression analysis to 
      study the functional relationships among polyQ genes in different brain regions 
      using the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), a spatial map of gene expression in the 
      healthy brain. We constructed co-expression networks for seven anatomical brain 
      structures, as well as a region showing a specific pattern of atrophy in HD 
      patients detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. In this 
      HD-associated region, we found that ATN1 and ATXN2 were co-expressed and shared 
      co-expression partners which were enriched for DNA repair genes. We observed a 
      similar co-expression pattern in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and striatum in 
      which this relation was most pronounced. Given that the co-expression patterns 
      for these anatomical structures were similar to those for the HD-associated 
      region, our results suggest that their disruption is likely involved in HD 
      pathology. Moreover, ATN1 and ATXN2 also shared many co-expressed genes with HTT, 
      the causative gene of HD, across the brain. Although this triangular relationship 
      among these three polyQ genes may also be dysregulated in other polyQ diseases, 
      stronger co-expression patterns between ATN1 and ATXN2 observed in the 
      HD-associated region, especially in the striatum, may be more specific to HD.

AB  - Progressive cerebellar ataxias are well-known hereditary neurological disorders. 
      Among them, spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is inherited as an autosomal 
      dominant trait and is ascribed to the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      within the ATXN7 gene. An anticipation phenomenon can occur during paternal 
      transmission and sometimes is responsible for a severe infantile form. The 
      specificity of SCA7 is the retinal involvement with retinitis pigmentosa and cone 
      rod dystrophy. We describe a familial form with two siblings who died of a severe 
      infantile form. Diagnosis was made in their father, who had a recent history of 
      macular atrophy and presented with gait disturbance thereafter. Retrospectively, 
      substantial triplet repeat expansion was confirmed in the two affected infants. 
      These infantile forms are rare and difficult to diagnose in the absence of 
      suggestive family symptoms.

LID - 492
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postural tremor can sometimes occur in spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs). However, the prevalence and clinical characteristics of postural tremor 
      in SCAs are poorly understood, and whether SCA patients with postural tremor have 
      different ataxia progression is not known. METHODS: We studied postural tremor in 
      315 patients with SCA1, 2, 3, and 6 recruited from the Clinical Research 
      Consortium for Spinocerebellar Ataxias (CRC-SCA), which consists of 12 
      participating centers in the United States, and we evaluated ataxia progression 
      in these patients from January 2010 to August 2012. RESULTS: Among 315 SCA 
      patients, postural tremor was most common in SCA2 patients (SCA1, 5.8%; SCA2, 
      27.5%; SCA3, 12.4%; SCA6, 16.9%; p = 0.007). SCA3 patients with postural tremor 
      had longer CAG repeat expansions than SCA3 patients without postural tremor 
      (73.67 +/- 3.12 vs. 70.42 +/- 3.96, p = 0.003). Interestingly, SCA1 and SCA6 patients 
      with postural tremor had a slower rate of ataxia progression (SCA1, beta = -0.91, p 
      < 0.001; SCA6, beta = -1.28, p = 0.025), while SCA2 patients with postural tremor 
      had a faster rate of ataxia progression (beta = 1.54, p = 0.034). We also found that 
      the presence of postural tremor in SCA2 patients could be influenced by repeat 
      expansions of ATXN1 (beta = -1.53, p = 0.037) and ATXN3 (beta = 0.57, p = 0.018), 
      whereas postural tremor in SCA3 was associated with repeat lengths in TBP (beta = 
      0.63, p = 0.041) and PPP2R2B (beta = -0.40, p = 0.032). DISCUSSION: Postural tremor 
      could be a clinical feature of SCAs, and the presence of postural tremor could be 
      associated with different rates of ataxia progression. Genetic interactions 
      between ataxia genes might influence the brain circuitry and thus affect the 
      clinical presentation of postural tremor.

AB  - Polyglutamine disorders are neurodegenerative diseases that share a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the coding region, resulting in aggregated proteins that can be only 
      degraded through aggrephagy. We measured the expression of autophagy genes in 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 20 patients with Huntington's disease (HD), 
      20 with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), and 20 healthy individuals. HD 
      patients showed increased expression of MAP1LC3B (+ 43%; p = 0.048), SQSTM1 
      (+ 49%; p = 0.002), and WDFY3 (+ 89%; p < 0.001). SCA2 patients had increased 
      expression of WDFY3 (+ 69%; p < 0.001). We show that peripheral markers of 
      autophagy are elevated in polyQ diseases, and this is particularly evident in HD.

TI  - Bicistronic CACNA1A Gene Expression in Neurons Derived from Spinocerebellar 
      Ataxia Type 6 Patient-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.
PG  - 1612-1625
LID - 10.1089/scd.2017.0085 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder that is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the CACNA1A 
      gene. As one of the few bicistronic genes discovered in the human genome, CACNA1A 
      encodes not only the alpha1A subunit of the P/Q type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel 
      Ca(V)2.1 but also the alpha1ACT protein, a 75 kDa transcription factor sharing the 
      sequence of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of the alpha1A subunit. Isoforms of both 
      proteins contain the polyglutamine (polyQ) domain that is expanded in SCA6 
      patients. Although certain SCA6 phenotypes appear to be specific for Purkinje 
      neurons, other pathogenic effects of the SCA6 polyQ mutation can affect a broad 
      spectrum of central nervous system (CNS) neuronal subtypes. We investigated the 
      expression and function of CACNA1A gene products in human neurons derived from 
      induced pluripotent stem cells from two SCA6 patients. Expression levels of 
      CACNA1A encoding alpha1A subunit were similar between SCA6 and control neurons, and 
      no differences were found in the subcellular distribution of Ca(V)2.1 channel 
      protein. The alpha1ACT immunoreactivity was detected in the majority of cell nuclei 
      of SCA6 and control neurons. Although no SCA6 genotype-dependent differences in 
      Ca(V)2.1 channel function were observed, they were found in the expression levels 
      of the alpha1ACT target gene Granulin (GRN) and in glutamate-induced cell 
      vulnerability.

TI  - Comparison of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 mouse models identifies early 
      gain-of-function, cell-autonomous transcriptional changes in oligodendrocytes.
PG  - 3362-3374
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddx224 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. This expansion 
      leads to misfolding and aggregation of mutant ataxin-3 (ATXN3) and degeneration 
      of select brain regions. A key unanswered question in SCA3 and other 
      polyglutamine diseases is the extent to which neurodegeneration is mediated 
      through gain-of-function versus loss-of-function. To address this question in 
      SCA3, we performed transcriptional profiling on the brainstem, a highly 
      vulnerable brain region in SCA3, in a series of mouse models with varying degrees 
      of ATXN3 expression and aggregation. We include two SCA3 knock-in mouse models: 
      our previously published model that erroneously harbors a tandem duplicate of the 
      CAG repeat-containing exon, and a corrected model, introduced here. Both models 
      exhibit dose-dependent neuronal accumulation and aggregation of mutant ATXN3, but 
      do not exhibit a behavioral phenotype. We identified a molecular signature that 
      correlates with ATXN3 neuronal aggregation yet is primarily linked to 
      oligodendrocytes, highlighting early white matter dysfunction in SCA3. Two 
      robustly elevated oligodendrocyte transcripts, Acy3 and Tnfrsf13c, were confirmed 
      as elevated at the protein level in SCA3 human disease brainstem. To determine if 
      mutant ATXN3 acts on oligodendrocytes cell-autonomously, we manipulated the 
      repeat expansion in the variant SCA3 knock-in mouse by cell-type specific 
      Cre/LoxP recombination. Changes in oligodendrocyte transcripts are driven 
      cell-autonomously and occur independent of neuronal ATXN3 aggregation. Our 
      findings support a primary toxic gain of function mechanism and highlight a 
      previously unrecognized role for oligodendrocyte dysfunction in SCA3 disease 
      pathogenesis.

TI  - Synergistic Toxicity of Polyglutamine-Expanded TATA-Binding Protein in Glia and 
      Neuronal Cells: Therapeutic Implications for Spinocerebellar Ataxia 17.
PG  - 9101-9115
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0111-17.2017 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 17 (SCA17) is caused by polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat 
      expansion in the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and is among a family of 
      neurodegenerative diseases in which polyQ expansion leads to preferential 
      neuronal loss in the brain. Although previous studies have demonstrated that 
      expression of polyQ-expanded proteins in glial cells can cause neuronal injury 
      via noncell-autonomous mechanisms, these studies investigated animal models that 
      overexpress transgenic mutant proteins. Since glial cells are particularly 
      reactive to overexpressed mutant proteins, it is important to investigate the in 
      vivo role of glial dysfunction in neurodegeneration when mutant polyQ proteins 
      are endogenously expressed. In the current study, we generated two conditional 
      TBP-105Q knock-in mouse models that specifically express mutant TBP at the 
      endogenous level in neurons or in astrocytes. We found that mutant TBP expression 
      in neuronal cells or astrocytes alone only caused mild neurodegeneration, whereas 
      severe neuronal toxicity requires the expression of mutant TBP in both neuronal 
      and glial cells. Coculture of neurons and astrocytes further validated that 
      mutant TBP in astrocytes promoted neuronal injury. We identified activated 
      inflammatory signaling pathways in mutant TBP-expressing astrocytes, and blocking 
      nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling in astrocytes ameliorated neurodegeneration. 
      Our results indicate that the synergistic toxicity of mutant TBP in neuronal and 
      glial cells plays a critical role in SCA17 pathogenesis and that targeting glial 
      inflammation could be a potential therapeutic approach for SCA17 
      treatment.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Mutant TBP with polyglutamine expansion 
      preferentially affects neuronal viability in SCA17 patients. Whether glia, the 
      cells that support and protect neurons, contribute to neurodegeneration in SCA17 
      remains mostly unexplored. In this study, we provide both in vivo and in vitro 
      evidence arguing that endogenous expression of mutant TBP in neurons and glia 
      synergistically impacts neuronal survival. Hyperactivated inflammatory signaling 
      pathways, particularly the NF-kappaB pathway, underlie glia-mediated neurotoxicity. 
      Moreover, blocking NF-kappaB activity with small chemical inhibitors alleviated such 
      neurotoxicity. Our study establishes glial dysfunction as an important component 
      of SCA17 pathogenesis and suggests targeting glial inflammation as a potential 
      therapeutic approach for SCA17 treatment.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by slowly progressive cerebellar dysfunction. Currently, 42 SCA 
      types are known, some of which are caused by CAG repeat expansions, but others 
      are caused by point mutations or deletions. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 
      (SCA14) is caused by missense mutations or deletions in the PRKCG gene, coding 
      for protein kinase C gamma (PKCgamma). It is still not well understood how these 
      mutations eventually cause Purkinje cell dysfunction and death. Because PKCgamma is a 
      well characterized signaling protein highly expressed in Purkinje cells SCA14 
      offers the chance to better understand the pathogenesis of Purkinje cell 
      dysfunction and death. Altered biological activity of PKCgamma would be the simplest 
      explanation for the disease phenotype. There are indeed indications that the 
      enzymatic activity of mutated PKCgamma proteins could be changed. Many mutations 
      found in SCA14 families are located in the regulatory C1B and C1A domain, while a 
      few mutations are also found in the C2 and in the catalytic C3 and C4 domains. 
      For many of these mutations an increased enzymatic activity could be demonstrated 
      in cell-based assays, but it remains unclear whether there is indeed an altered 
      biological activity of the mutated PKCgamma proteins within living Purkinje cells. In 
      this study we used the dendritic morphology of developing Purkinje cells to 
      detect increased biological activity of PKCgamma after expression of different 
      mutated PKCgamma proteins. Our results indicate that two out of three known mutations 
      in the catalytic domain of PKCgamma did indeed show increased biological activity. On 
      the other hand, none of the five tested mutations located in the regulatory C1 or 
      the C2 domain showed an increased biological activity. Our findings indicate that 
      SCA14 mutations located in different domains of the PRKCG gene cause SCA14 by 
      different mechanisms and that an increased constitutive activity of PKCgamma may be 
      one, but cannot be the only mechanism to cause disease in SCA14.

TI  - A Pentanucleotide ATTTC Repeat Insertion in the Non-coding Region of DAB1, 
      Mapping to SCA37, Causes Spinocerebellar Ataxia.

AB  - Advances in human genetics in recent years have largely been driven by 
      next-generation sequencing (NGS); however, the discovery of disease-related gene 
      mutations has been biased toward the exome because the large and very repetitive 
      regions that characterize the non-coding genome remain difficult to reach by that 
      technology. For autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), 28 genes have 
      been identified, but only five SCAs originate from non-coding mutations. Over 
      half of SCA-affected families, however, remain without a genetic diagnosis. We 
      used genome-wide linkage analysis, NGS, and repeat analysis to identify an 
      (ATTTC)(n) insertion in a polymorphic ATTTT repeat in DAB1 in chromosomal region 
      1p32.2 as the cause of autosomal-dominant SCA; this region has been previously 
      linked to SCA37. The non-pathogenic and pathogenic alleles have the 
      configurations [(ATTTT)(7-400)] and [(ATTTT)(60-79)(ATTTC)(31-75)(ATTTT)(58-90)], 
      respectively. (ATTTC)(n) insertions are present on a distinct haplotype and show 
      an inverse correlation between size and age of onset. In the DAB1-oriented 
      strand, (ATTTC)(n) is located in 5' UTR introns of cerebellar-specific 
      transcripts arising mostly during human fetal brain development from the usage of 
      alternative promoters, but it is maintained in the adult cerebellum. 
      Overexpression of the transfected (ATTTC)(58) insertion, but not (ATTTT)(n), 
      leads to abnormal nuclear RNA accumulation. Zebrafish embryos injected with RNA 
      of the (AUUUC)(58) insertion, but not (AUUUU)(n), showed lethal developmental 
      malformations. Together, these results establish an unstable repeat insertion in 
      DAB1 as a cause of cerebellar degeneration; on the basis of the genetic and 
      phenotypic evidence, we propose this mutation as the molecular basis for SCA37.

TI  - A Complete Association of an intronic SNP rs6798742 with Origin of 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 7-CAG Expansion Loci in the Indian and Mexican 
      Population.
PG  - 197-204
LID - 10.1111/ahg.12200 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a rare neurogenetic disorder caused by 
      highly unstable CAG repeat expansion mutation in coding region of SCA7. We aimed 
      to understand the effect of diverse ATXN7 cis-element in correlation with CAG 
      expansion mutation of SCA7. We initially performed an analysis to identify the 
      haplotype background of CAG expanded alleles using eight bi-allelic single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) flanking an ATXN7-CAG expansion in 32 individuals 
      from nine unrelated Indian SCA7 families and 88 healthy controls. Subsequent 
      validation of the findings was performed in 89 ATXN7-CAG mutation carriers and in 
      119 unrelated healthy controls of Mexican ancestry. The haplotype analyses showed 
      a shared haplotype background and C allele of SNP rs6798742 (approximately 6 kb 
      from the 3'-end of CAG repeats) is in complete association with expanded, 
      premutation, intermediate, and the majority of large normal (>/=12) CAG allele. The 
      C allele (ancestral/chimp allele) association was validated in SCA7 subjects and 
      healthy controls from Mexico, suggesting its substantial association with CAG 
      expanded and expansion-prone chromosomes. Analysis of rs6798742 and other 
      neighboring functional SNPs within 6 kb in experimental datasets (Encyclopedia of 
      DNA Elements; ENCODE) shows functional marks that could affect transcription as 
      well as histone methylation. An allelic association of the CAG region to an 
      intronic SNP in two different ethnic and geographical populations suggests a -cis 
      factor-dependent mechanism in ATXN7 CAG-region expansion.

TI  - The replicative lifespan-extending deletion of SGF73 results in altered ribosomal 
      gene expression in yeast.
PG  - 785-796
LID - 10.1111/acel.12611 [doi]
AB  - Sgf73, a core component of SAGA, is the yeast orthologue of ataxin-7, which 
      undergoes CAG-polyglutamine repeat expansion leading to the human 
      neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7). Deletion of SGF73 
      dramatically extends replicative lifespan (RLS) in yeast. To further define the 
      basis for Sgf73-mediated RLS extension, we performed ChIP-Seq, identified 388 
      unique genomic regions occupied by Sgf73, and noted enrichment in promoters of 
      ribosomal protein (RP)-encoding genes. Of 388 Sgf73 binding sites, 33 correspond 
      to 5' regions of genes implicated in RLS extension, including 20 genes encoding 
      RPs. Furthermore, half of Sgf73-occupied, RLS-linked RP genes displayed 
      significantly reduced expression in sgf73Delta mutants, and double null strains 
      lacking SGF73 and a Sgf73-regulated, RLS-linked RP gene exhibited no further 
      increase in replicative lifespan. We also found that sgf73Delta mutants display 
      altered acetylation of Ifh1, an important regulator of RP gene transcription. 
      These findings implicate altered ribosomal protein expression in sgf73Delta yeast RLS 
      and highlight altered acetylation as a pathway of relevance for SCA7 
      neurodegeneration.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN2 gene. The repeat resides in 
      an encoded region of the gene resulting in polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion which 
      has been assumed to result in gain of function, predominantly, for the ATXN2 
      protein. We evaluated temporal cerebellar expression profiles by RNA sequencing 
      of ATXN2Q127 mice versus wild-type (WT) littermates. ATXN2Q127 mice are 
      characterized by a progressive motor phenotype onset, and have progressive 
      cerebellar molecular and neurophysiological (Purkinje cell firing frequency) 
      phenotypes. Our analysis revealed previously uncharacterized early and 
      progressive abnormal patterning of cerebellar gene expression. Weighted Gene 
      Coexpression Network Analysis revealed four gene modules that were significantly 
      correlated with disease status, composed primarily of genes associated with 
      GTPase signaling, calcium signaling and cell death. Of these genes, few 
      overlapped with differentially expressed cerebellar genes that we identified in 
      Atxn2-/- knockout mice versus WT littermates, suggesting that loss-of-function is 
      not a significant component of disease pathology. We conclude that SCA2 is a 
      disease characterized by gain of function for ATXN2.

TI  - A panel study on patients with dominant cerebellar ataxia highlights the 
      frequency of channelopathies.
PG  - 1579-1594
LID - 10.1093/brain/awx081 [doi]
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias have a marked heterogeneous genetic 
      background, with mutations in 34 genes identified so far. This large amount of 
      implicated genes accounts for heterogeneous clinical presentations, making 
      genotype-phenotype correlations a major challenge in the field. While 
      polyglutamine ataxias, linked to CAG repeat expansions in genes such as ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, CACNA1A and TBP, have been extensively characterized in 
      large cohorts, there is a need for comprehensive assessment of frequency and 
      phenotype of more 'conventional' ataxias. After exclusion of CAG/polyglutamine 
      expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia genes in 412 index cases with dominantly 
      inherited cerebellar ataxias, we aimed to establish the relative frequencies of 
      mutations in other genes, with an approach combining panel sequencing and TaqMan(R) 
      polymerase chain reaction assay. We found relevant genetic variants in 59 
      patients (14.3%). The most frequently mutated were channel genes [CACNA1A (n = 
      16), KCND3 (n = 4), KCNC3 (n = 2) and KCNA1 (n = 2)]. Deletions in ITPR1 (n = 11) 
      were followed by biallelic variants in SPG7 (n = 9). Variants in AFG3L2 (n = 7) 
      came next in frequency, and variants were rarely found in STBN2 (n = 2), ELOVL5, 
      FGF14, STUB1 and TTBK2 (n = 1 each). Interestingly, possible risk factor variants 
      were detected in SPG7 and POLG. Clinical comparisons showed that ataxias due to 
      channelopathies had a significantly earlier age at onset with an average of 24.6 
      years, versus 40.9 years for polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias and 
      37.8 years for SPG7-related forms (P = 0.001). In contrast, disease duration was 
      significantly longer in the former (20.5 years versus 9.3 and 13.7, P=0.001), 
      though for similar functional stages, indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. Of interest, intellectual deficiency was more frequent in channel 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, while cognitive impairment in adulthood was similar 
      among the three groups. Similar differences were found among a single gene group, 
      comparing 23 patients with CACNA1A expansions (spinocerebellar ataxia 6) to 22 
      patients with CACNA1A point mutations, which had lower average age at onset (25.2 
      versus 47.3 years) with longer disease duration (18.7 versus 10.9), but lower 
      severity indexes (0.39 versus 0.44), indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. In conclusion, we identified relevant genetic variations in up to 15% of 
      cases after exclusion of polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias, and 
      confirmed CACNA1A and SPG7 as major ataxia genes. We could delineate firm 
      genotype-phenotype correlations that are important for genetic counselling and of 
      possible prognostic value.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10), an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia 
      disorder, is caused by a non-coding ATTCT microsatellite repeat expansion in the 
      ataxin 10 gene. In a subset of SCA10 families, the 5'-end of the repeat expansion 
      contains a complex sequence of penta- and heptanucleotide interruption motifs 
      which is followed by a pure tract of tandem ATCCT repeats of unknown length at 
      its 3'-end. Intriguingly, expansions that carry these interruption motifs 
      correlate with an epileptic seizure phenotype and are unstable despite the theory 
      that interruptions are expected to stabilize expanded repeats. To examine the 
      apparent contradiction of unstable, interruption-positive SCA10 expansion alleles 
      and to determine whether the instability originates outside of the interrupted 
      region, we sequenced approximately 1 kb of the 5'-end of SCA10 expansions using 
      the ATCCT-PCR product in individuals across multiple generations from four SCA10 
      families. We found that the greatest instability within this region occurred in 
      paternal transmissions of the allele in stretches of pure ATTCT motifs while the 
      intervening interrupted sequences were stable. Overall, the ATCCT interruption 
      changes by only one to three repeat units and therefore cannot account for the 
      instability across the length of the disease allele. We conclude that the AT-rich 
      interruptions locally stabilize the SCA10 expansion at the 5'-end but do not 
      completely abolish instability across the entire span of the expansion. In 
      addition, analysis of the interruption alleles across these families support a 
      parsimonious single origin of the mutation with a shared distant ancestor.

TI  - Spinal Cord Damage in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1.
PG  - 792-796
LID - 10.1007/s12311-017-0854-9 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by 
      a CAG repeat expansion, characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia and 
      pyramidal signs. Non-motor and extracerebellar symptoms may occur. MRI-based 
      studies in SCA1 focused in the cerebellum and connections, but there are no data 
      about cord damage in the disease and its clinical relevance. To evaluate in vivo 
      spinal cord damage in SCA1, a group of 31 patients with SCA1 and 31 age- and 
      gender-matched healthy controls underwent MRI on a 3T scanner. We used 
      T1-weighted 3D images to estimate the cervical spinal cord area (CA) and 
      eccentricity (CE) at three C2/C3 levels based on a semi-automatic image 
      segmentation protocol. The scale for assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA) was 
      used to quantify disease severity. The groups were significantly different 
      regarding CA (47.26 +/- 7.4 vs. 68.8 +/- 5.7 mm2, p < 0.001) and CE values 
      (0.803 +/- 0.044 vs. 0.774 +/- 0.043, p < 0.05). Furthermore, in the patient group, 
      CA presented significant correlation with SARA scores (R = -0.633, p < 0.001) and 
      CAGn expansion (R = -0.658, p < 0.001). CE was not associated with SARA scores 
      (p = 0.431). In the multiple variable regression, CA was strongly associated with 
      disease duration (coefficient -0.360, p < 0.05) and CAGn expansion (coefficient 
      -1.124, p < 0.001). SCA1 is characterized by cervical cord atrophy and 
      anteroposterior flattening. Morphometric analyses of the spinal cord MRI might be 
      a useful biomarker in the disease.

AB  - Microsatellite expansion disorders are pathologically characterized by RNA foci 
      formation and repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. However, their 
      underlying pathomechanisms and regulation of RAN translation remain unknown. We 
      report that expression of expanded UGGAA (UGGAA(exp)) repeats, responsible for 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 (SCA31) in Drosophila, causes neurodegeneration 
      accompanied by accumulation of UGGAA(exp) RNA foci and translation of 
      repeat-associated pentapeptide repeat (PPR) proteins, consistent with 
      observations in SCA31 patient brains. We revealed that motor-neuron disease 
      (MND)-linked RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), TDP-43, FUS, and hnRNPA2B1, bind to and 
      induce structural alteration of UGGAA(exp). These RBPs suppress 
      UGGAA(exp)-mediated toxicity in Drosophila by functioning as RNA chaperones for 
      proper UGGAA(exp) folding and regulation of PPR translation. Furthermore, 
      nontoxic short UGGAA repeat RNA suppressed mutated RBP aggregation and toxicity 
      in MND Drosophila models. Thus, functional crosstalk of the RNA/RBP network 
      regulates their own quality and balance, suggesting convergence of 
      pathomechanisms in microsatellite expansion disorders and RBP proteinopathies.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused 
      by a CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin-2 gene. We show increased oxidative 
      stress, abnormalities in the antioxidant system, changes in complexes involved in 
      oxidative phosphorylation and changes in mitochondrial morphology in SCA2 patient 
      fibroblasts compared to controls, and we show that treatment with CoQ10 can 
      partially reverse these changes. Together, our results suggest that oxidative 
      stress and mitochondrial dysfunction may be contributory factors to the 
      pathophysiology of SCA2 and that therapeutic strategies involving manipulation of 
      the antioxidant system could prove to be of clinical benefit.

TI  - Analysis of a fully penetrant spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 Brazilian family.
PG  - 541-545
LID - 10.1111/ane.12744 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a progressive neurological disorder 
      caused by the expanded repeat CTA/CTG of two overlapping genes, ATXN8OS and 
      ATXN8, expressed bidirectionally. Normal alleles have 15-50 repeats, and 
      pathogenic alleles range from 71 to 1300 repeats. The disorder is relatively 
      rare, accounting for about 2%-5% of the autosomal dominant forms of hereditary 
      ataxia worldwide. However, the prevalence of disease-causing ATXN8OS/ATXN8 
      expansions is higher than the disease because of the reduced penetrance of the 
      expanded allele. The aim of this study was to describe the first fully penetrant 
      SCA8 family showing mixed Brazilian African and Amerindian origin. Eight members 
      of this family were evaluated-the mother and seven offspring-through a complete 
      neurological examination conducted at the Neurogenetics Clinic, HCFMRP-USP in 
      Brazil. The number of CTA/CTG repeats was obtained after polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) and fragment analysis. The haplotype analysis was conducted using 
      a microsatellite marker, D13S1296, and four single nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs), rs1831189, rs8002227, rs11841483, and rs72284461, all spanning a 70.1 Mb 
      region on chromosome 13q21.3. The molecular analysis showed that the expansions 
      ranged from 104 to 109 CTA/CTG repeats in the six affected individuals and were 
      absent in two asymptomatic daughters (aged 53 and 40 years). Three SNPs 
      cosegregate with the expanded alleles, confirming the connection between 
      expansion and disease in this family. As the SCA8 diagnosis demands careful 
      interpretation, we suggest the use of linkage analysis to observe segregation of 
      the mutation, making more accurate its genotyping.

TI  - Interaction of the polyglutamine protein ataxin-3 with Rad23 regulates toxicity 
      in Drosophila models of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3.
PG  - 1419-1431
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddx039 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the deubiquitinase ataxin-3 causes 
      neurodegeneration in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3), one of nine inherited, 
      incurable diseases caused by similar mutations. Ataxin-3's degradation is 
      inhibited by its binding to the proteasome shuttle Rad23 through 
      ubiquitin-binding site 2 (UbS2). Disrupting this interaction decreases levels of 
      ataxin-3. Since reducing levels of polyQ proteins can decrease their toxicity, we 
      tested whether genetically modulating the ataxin-3-Rad23 interaction regulates 
      its toxicity in Drosophila. We found that exogenous Rad23 increases the toxicity 
      of pathogenic ataxin-3, coincident with increased levels of the disease protein. 
      Conversely, reducing Rad23 levels alleviates toxicity in this SCA3 model. 
      Unexpectedly, pathogenic ataxin-3 with a mutated Rad23-binding site at UbS2, 
      despite being present at markedly lower levels, proved to be more pathogenic than 
      a disease-causing counterpart with intact UbS2. Additional studies established 
      that the increased toxicity upon mutating UbS2 stems from disrupting the 
      autoprotective role that pathogenic ataxin-3 has against itself, which depends on 
      the co-chaperone, DnaJ-1. Our data reveal a previously unrecognized balance 
      between pathogenic and potentially therapeutic properties of the ataxin-3-Rad23 
      interaction; they highlight this interaction as critical for the toxicity of the 
      SCA3 protein, and emphasize the importance of considering protein context when 
      pursuing suppressive avenues.

TI  - Diagnosis of Spinocerebellar Ataxias Caused by Trinucleotide Repeat Expansions.
PG  - 9.30.1-9.30.22
LID - 10.1002/cphg.30 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of disorders that are both clinically 
      and genetically heterogeneous. They usually demonstrate onset in adulthood, but 
      some forms may have juvenile or infantile onset. There are many different types 
      of SCA, demonstrating different modes of inheritance and types of mutation. The 
      most common forms are due to dominantly inherited expansions in trinucleotide 
      repeat sequences located within the coding region of the relevant genes, and 
      these are readily identifiable by molecular genetic testing. In general, it is 
      possible to test for these disorders using PCR-based assays, amplifying across 
      the trinucleotide repeat regions and sizing the PCR products to determine the 
      number of repeats. Larger expansions are generally associated with a more severe 
      presentation of the disorder, and alternative methods may be necessary to detect 
      these alleles. This protocol describes methods for detecting normal and expanded 
      triplet repeat alleles in the most common SCA genes. (c) 2017 by John Wiley & Sons,

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 is a neurodegenerative disorder caused 
      by a CAG repeat expansion in ATXN2 gene. There is high clinical variability among 
      affected patients suggesting the occurring of modifier genes influencing the 
      clinical phenotype. OBJECTIVE: The objective is to assess the association of 
      GSTO1 rs4925 and GSTO2 rs2297235 SNPs on the clinical phenotype in SCA2 patients. 
      METHODS: A case-control study was performed in a sample of 120 SCA2 Cuban 
      patients and 100 healthy subjects. Age at onset, 60 degrees  Maximal Saccade Velocity and 
      SARA score were used as clinical markers. GSTO1 rs4925 and GSTO2 rs2297235 SNPs 
      were determined by PCR/RFLP. RESULTS: Distribution of the GSTO1 alleles and 
      genotypes was nearly equal between the control group and SCA2 patients. GSTO1 
      genotypes were not associated to clinical markers in SCA2 patients. Distribution 
      of the GSTO2 "G" allele and "AG" genotype differed significantly between SCA2 
      patients and controls. Symptomatic SCA2 individuals had a 2.29-fold higher chance 
      of carrying at least one "G" allele at GSTO2 rs2297235 than controls (OR=2.29, 
      95% CI: 1.29-4.04). GSTO2 genotypes were significantly associated to age at onset 
      (p=0.037) but not to 60 degrees  Maximal Saccade Velocity or SARA score in SCA2 patients. 
      CONCLUSION: The GSTO1 rs4925 polymorphism is not associated to SCA2. Meanwhile, 
      the GSTO2 rs2297235 "AG" genotype is associated to SCA2 but failed to show any 
      association with clinical markers, with the exception of a potential association 
      with the age at disease onset.

TI  - Mutant CAG Repeats Effectively Targeted by RNA Interference in SCA7 Cells.
LID - 10.3390/genes7120132 [doi]
LID - 132
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a human neurodegenerative polyglutamine 
      (polyQ) disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the open reading frame of the 
      ATXN7 gene. The allele-selective silencing of mutant transcripts using a 
      repeat-targeting strategy has previously been used for several polyQ diseases. 
      Herein, we demonstrate that the selective targeting of a repeat tract in a mutant 
      ATXN7 transcript by RNA interference is a feasible approach and results in an 
      efficient decrease of mutant ataxin-7 protein in patient-derived cells. 
      Oligonucleotides (ONs) containing specific base substitutions cause the 
      downregulation of the ATXN7 mutant allele together with the upregulation of its 
      normal allele. The A2 ON shows high allele selectivity at a broad range of 
      concentrations and also restores UCHL1 expression, which is downregulated in 
      SCA7.

TI  - Clinical behaviour of spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 and intermediate length 
      abnormal CAG repeats in PPP2R2B.
PG  - 27-36

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by CAG repeat expansion in the PPP2R2B gene. Previously, the causal length 
      of CAG repeats ascribed to SCA12 was more than 51; however, a few reports have 
      also described unusual occurrence of CAG repeat length 36-51 repeats among 
      patients of different geographical population, with atypical clinical 
      association. From our systematic search for SCA12 in a genetic screening 
      programme, we have identified a large number of SCA12 cases. In this study, we 
      specifically describe the clinical behaviour of 18 patients who harbour CAG 
      repeats in the range of 43-50 and compare their clinical behaviour with patients 
      carrying typical pathogenic threshold length of 51 CAG repeats. Unsurprisingly, 
      we observed that the clinical characteristics were similar to those of typical 
      SCA12 phenotype, with large variability in the age at onset. Radiologically, we 
      observed a variable degree of cerebro-cerebellar degeneration along with white 
      matter changes that do not correlate with the disease severity. We define a new 
      pathogenic threshold of CAG-43 to be pathogenic for SCA12 diagnosis and also 
      describe the clinical profiles of two biallelic CAG expansion carriers. We also 
      propose that SCA12 might not be that restricted in terms of occurrence in other 
      geographical or ethnic populations, as it was previously presumed to be.

TI  - The Initial Symptom and Motor Progression in Spinocerebellar Ataxias.
PG  - 615-622

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine whether the initial symptom associates with 
      motor progression in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). SCAs are clinically 
      heterogeneous and the initial presentation may represent different subtypes of 
      SCA with different motor progression. We studied 317 participants with SCAs1, 2, 
      3, and 6 from the Clinical Research Consortium for SCAs (CRC-SCA) and repeatedly 
      measured the severity of ataxia for 2 years. SCA patients were divided into 
      gait-onset and non-gait-onset (speech, vision, and hand dexterity) groups based 
      on the initial presentation. In addition to demographic comparison, we employed 
      regression models to study ataxia progression in these two groups after adjusting 
      for age, sex, and pathological CAG repeats. The majority of SCA patients had gait 
      abnormality as an initial presentation. The pathological CAG repeat expansions 
      were similar between the gait-onset and non-gait-onset groups. In SCA1, 
      gait-onset group progressed slower than non-gait-onset group, while gait-onset 
      SCA6 group progressed faster than their counterpart. In addition, the disease 
      presented 9 years later for SCA2 gait-onset group than non-gait-onset group. 
      Initial symptoms of SCA3 did not influence age of onset or disease progression. 
      The initial symptom in each SCA has a different influence on age of onset and 
      motor progression. Therefore, gait and non-gait-onset groups of SCAs might 
      represent different subtypes of the diseases.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease characterized by loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. SCA6 is caused 
      by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in CACNA1A, which encodes Cav2.1, alpha1A 
      subunit of P/Q-type calcium channel. However, the pathogenic mechanism and 
      effective therapeutic treatments are still unknown. Here, we have succeeded in 
      generating differentiated Purkinje cells that carry patient genes by combining 
      disease-specific iPSCs and self-organizing culture technologies. Patient-derived 
      Purkinje cells exhibit increased levels of full-length Cav2.1 protein but 
      decreased levels of its C-terminal fragment and downregulation of the 
      transcriptional targets TAF1 and BTG1. We further demonstrate that SCA6 Purkinje 
      cells exhibit thyroid hormone depletion-dependent degeneration, which can be 
      suppressed by two compounds, thyroid releasing hormone and Riluzole. Thus, we 
      have constructed an in vitro disease model recapitulating both ontogenesis and 
      pathogenesis. This model may be useful for pathogenic investigation and drug 
      screening.

AB  - The neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is caused by a 
      CAG-repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. In this study, induced pluripotent stem 
      cell (iPSC) lines were established from two SCA3 patients. Dermal fibroblasts 
      were reprogrammed using an integration-free method and the resulting SCA3 iPSCs 
      were differentiated into neurons. These neuronal lines harbored the disease 
      causing mutation, expressed comparable levels of several neuronal markers and 
      responded to the neurotransmitters, glutamate/glycine, GABA and acetylcholine. 
      Additionally, all neuronal cultures formed networks displaying synchronized 
      spontaneous calcium oscillations within 28days of maturation, and expressed the 
      mature neuronal markers NeuN and Synapsin 1 implying a relatively advanced state 
      of maturity, although not comparable to that of the adult human brain. 
      Interestingly, we were not able to recapitulate the glutamate-induced ataxin-3 
      aggregation shown in a previously published iPSC-derived SCA3 model. In 
      conclusion, we have generated a panel of SCA3 patient iPSCs and a robust protocol 
      to derive neurons of relatively advanced maturity, which could potentially be 
      valuable for the study of SCA3 disease mechanisms.

AB  - Expansion of CAG repeats, which code for the disease-causing polyglutamine 
      protein, is a common feature in polyglutamine diseases. RNA-mediated mechanisms 
      that contribute to neuropathology in polyglutamine diseases are important. 
      RNA-toxicity describes a phenomenon by which the mutant CAG repeat RNA recruits 
      RNA-binding proteins, thereby leading to aberrant function. For example the MID1 
      protein binds to mutant huntingtin (HTT) RNA, which is linked to Huntington's 
      disease (HD), at its CAG repeat region and induces protein synthesis of mutant 
      protein. But is this mechanism specific to HD or is it a common mechanism in CAG 
      repeat expansion disorders? To answer this question, we have analyzed the 
      interaction between MID1 and three other CAG repeat mRNAs, Ataxin2 (ATXN2), 
      Ataxin3 (ATXN3), and Ataxin7 (ATXN7), that all differ in the sequence flanking 
      the CAG repeat. We show that ATXN2, ATXN3, and ATXN7 bind to MID1 in a CAG repeat 
      length-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that functionally, in line with 
      what we have previously observed for HTT, the binding of MID1 to ATXN2, ATXN3, 
      and ATXN7 mRNA induces protein synthesis in a repeat length-dependent manner. Our 
      data suggest that regulation of protein translation by the MID1 complex is a 
      common mechanism for CAG repeat containing mRNAs.

LID - 35200
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 (SCA3) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      polyglutamine repeat expansion in the ataxin-3 protein. Cleavage of mutant 
      ataxin-3 by proteolytic enzymes yields ataxin-3 fragments containing the 
      polyglutamine stretch. These shorter ataxin-3 fragments are thought to be 
      involved in SCA3 pathogenesis due to their increased cellular toxicity and their 
      involvement in formation of the characteristic neuronal aggregates. As a strategy 
      to prevent formation of toxic cleavage fragments, we investigated an antisense 
      oligonucleotide-mediated modification of the ataxin-3 pre-mRNA through exon 
      skipping of exon 8 and 9, resulting in the removal of a central 88 amino acid 
      region of the ataxin-3 protein. This removed protein region contains several 
      predicted cleavage sites and two ubiquitin-interacting motifs. In contrast to 
      unmodified mutant ataxin-3, the internally truncated ataxin-3 protein did not 
      give rise to potentially toxic cleavage fragments when incubated with caspases. 
      In vitro experiments did not show cellular toxicity of the modified ataxin-3 
      protein. However, the modified protein was incapable of binding poly-ubiquitin 
      chains, which may interfere with its normal deubiquitinating function. Low exon 
      skipping efficiencies combined with reduction in important ataxin-3 protein 
      functions suggest that skipping of exon 8 and 9 is not a viable therapeutic 
      option for SCA3.

TI  - RETINAL MANIFESTATIONS OF SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA TYPE 7 IN TWO CONSECUTIVE 
      GENERATIONS.
PG  - S86-S89

AB  - PURPOSE: To report a diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia Type 7 (SCA-7) first 
      diagnosed in the daughter followed by the father, with proven genetic testing and 
      display of progressive anticipation of disease penetrance. METHODS: A 5-year-old 
      African American female admitted for failure to thrive underwent full ocular 
      examination and fundus photography, with genetic confirmation of SCA-7. The 
      father carried a previous diagnosis of possible solar retinopathy; however, with 
      further genetic testing, he was also found to have SCA-7. RESULTS: The patient 
      was admitted for failure to thrive with suspicion of ataxia neurodegenerative 
      disorder. Visual acuity was hand motion. Fundus examination showed retinal 
      pigment epithelium pigmentary changes in the macula and peripheral retina. 
      Further genetic workup revealed 96 CAG repeat expansion compared with a normal of 
      <20 repeats. Ocular examination of patient's father displayed a milder form of 
      retinopathy with genetic testing showing 47 CAG repeat expansion. Diagnosis of 
      SCA-7 was made displaying genetic anticipation. CONCLUSION: Spinocerebellar 
      ataxia Type 7 is a disease of expanded CAG repeats showing genetic anticipation. 
      Patients display progressive cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria dysphagia, slow 
      saccadic eye movements, and cone photoreceptor loss leading to progressive vision 
      loss. CAG repeat length tends to expand with transmission resulting in dramatic 
      symptoms in offspring sometimes resulting in diagnosis before parents' diagnosis. 
      Awareness of this condition may help in earlier diagnosis and unnecessary testing 
      resulting in more effective counseling for the patient and their family.

TI  - Clinical features and genetic diagnosis of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia 3.
PG  - 3731-4
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2016.5707 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a rare inherited autosomal dominant 
      progressive neurological disorder, which results from a CAG...repeat expansion in 
      the gene encoding the deubiquitinating enzyme, ataxin...3. At present, no effective 
      treatment is available for this fatal disorder; however, certain studies have 
      suggested that reducing the levels of mutant ataxin...3 protein may reverse or halt 
      the progression of disease in patients with SCA3. In the present study, clinical 
      examinations were performed on a patient with SCA3 who exhibited disease features 
      including coughing, expectoration and was bedridden with mobility limitation. CAG 
      repetitions at SCA...associated genes were detected in the patient's family by 
      performing standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and triple...repeat primed PCR. 
      The numbers of CAG...repeats within the two alleles of the gene of interest in the 
      patient were 15 and 78. Notably, the patient's brother, who harbored 
      76 CAG...repeats in one allele of the gene of interest, did not exhibit severe 
      disease symptoms. These results suggest that the number of CAG...repeats is a 
      critical for determination of SCA3 disease severity and time of onset. In 
      addition, the de fi ned phenotypic characteristics of the patient in the present 
      study provide useful insight for more accurate clinical diagnosis and genotyping 
      of future patients.

TI  - ATXN2-AS, a gene antisense to ATXN2, is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 2 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
PG  - 600-15
LID - 10.1002/ana.24761 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene ataxin-2 (ATXN2). ATXN2 
      intermediate-length CAG expansions were identified as a risk factor for 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The ATXN2 CAG repeat is translated into 
      polyglutamine, and SCA2 pathogenesis has been thought to derive from ATXN2 
      protein containing an expanded polyglutamine tract. However, recent evidence of 
      bidirectional transcription at multiple CAG/CTG disease loci has led us to test 
      whether additional mechanisms of pathogenesis may contribute to SCA2. METHODS: In 
      this work, using human postmortem tissue, various cell models, and animal models, 
      we provide the first evidence that an antisense transcript at the SCA2 locus 
      contributes to SCA2 pathogenesis. RESULTS: We demonstrate the expression of a 
      transcript, containing the repeat as a CUG tract, derived from a gene (ATXN2-AS) 
      directly antisense to ATXN2. ATXN2-AS transcripts with normal and expanded CUG 
      repeats are expressed in human postmortem SCA2 brains, human SCA2 fibroblasts, 
      induced SCA2 pluripotent stem cells, SCA2 neural stem cells, and lymphoblastoid 
      lines containing an expanded ATXN2 allele associated with ALS. ATXN2-AS 
      transcripts with a CUG repeat expansion are toxic in an SCA2 cell model and form 
      RNA foci in SCA2 cerebellar Purkinje cells. Finally, we detected missplicing of 
      amyloid beta precursor protein and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 in SCA2 
      brains, consistent with findings in other diseases characterized by RNA-mediated 
      pathogenesis. INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that ATXN2-AS has a role in 
      SCA2 and possibly ALS pathogenesis, and may therefore provide a novel therapeutic 
      target for these diseases. Ann Neurol 2016;80:600-615.

TI  - An miRNA-mediated therapy for SCA6 blocks IRES-driven translation of the CACNA1A 
      second cistron.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease characterized by slowly progressive ataxia and Purkinje cell 
      degeneration. SCA6 is caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion within a second 
      CACNA1A gene product, alpha1ACT. alpha1ACT expression is under the control of an internal 
      ribosomal entry site (IRES) present within the CACNA1A coding region. Whereas 
      SCA6 allele knock-in mice show indistinguishable phenotypes from wild-type 
      littermates, expression of SCA6-associated alpha1ACT (alpha1ACTSCA6) driven by a Purkinje 
      cell-specific promoter in mice produces slowly progressive ataxia and cerebellar 
      atrophy. We developed an early-onset SCA6 mouse model using an adeno-associated 
      virus (AAV)-based gene delivery system to ectopically express CACNA1A IRES-driven 
      alpha1ACTSCA6 to test the potential of CACNA1A IRES-targeting therapies. Mice 
      expressing AAV9-mediated CACNA1A IRES-driven alpha1ACTSCA6 exhibited early-onset 
      ataxia, motor deficits, and Purkinje cell degeneration. We identified miR-3191-5p 
      as a microRNA (miRNA) that targeted CACNA1A IRES and preferentially inhibited the 
      CACNA1A IRES-driven translation of alpha1ACT in an Argonaute 4 (Ago4)-dependent 
      manner. We found that eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), eIF4AII and eIF4GII, 
      interacted with the CACNA1A IRES to enhance alpha1ACT translation. Ago4-bound 
      miR-3191-5p blocked the interaction of eIF4AII and eIF4GII with the CACNA1A IRES, 
      attenuating IRES-driven alpha1ACT translation. Furthermore, AAV9-mediated delivery of 
      miR-3191-5p protected mice from the ataxia, motor deficits, and Purkinje cell 
      degeneration caused by CACNA1A IRES-driven alpha1ACTSCA6 We have established proof of 
      principle that viral delivery of an miRNA can rescue a disease phenotype through 
      modulation of cellular IRES activity in a mouse model.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The natural history of clinical symptoms in the spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCA)s has been well characterised. However there is little longitudinal 
      data comparing cognitive changes in the most common SCA subtypes over time. The 
      present study provides a preliminary longitudinal characterisation of the 
      clinical and cognitive profiles in patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7, 
      with the aim of elucidating the role of the cerebellum in cognition. METHODS: 13 
      patients with different SCAs all caused by CAG repeat expansion (SCA1, n = 2; 
      SCA2, n = 2; SCA3, n = 2; SCA6, n = 4; and SCA7, n = 3) completed a comprehensive 
      battery of cognitive and mood assessments at two time points, a mean of 
      7.35 years apart. All patients were evaluated clinically using the Scale for the 
      Rating and Assessment of Ataxia (SARA) and the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs 
      (INAS). Patients underwent structural MRI imaging at follow-up. RESULTS: Clinical 
      scale scores increased in all patients over time, most prominently in the SCA1 
      (SARA) and SCA3 (INAS) groups. New impairments on neuropsychological tests were 
      most commonly observed with executive functions, speed, attention, visual memory 
      and Theory of Mind. Results suggest possible differences in cognitive decline in 
      SCA subtypes, with the most rapid cognitive decline observed in the SCA1 
      patients, and the least in the SCA6 patients, congruent with observed patterns of 
      motor deterioration. Minimal changes in mood were observed, and MRI measures of 
      atrophy did not correlate with cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: As well as 
      increasing physical impairment, cognitive decline over time appears to be a 
      distinct aspect of the SCA phenotype, in keeping with the cerebellar 
      cognitive-affective syndrome. Our data suggest a trend of cognitive decline that 
      is different for each SCA subtype, and for the majority is related to the 
      severity of cerebellar motor impairment.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type-7 (SCA7) is a cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat 
      polyglutamine disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of the 
      cerebellum, brainstem, spinal cord, and retina. Clinical features include 
      progressive ataxia, visual loss, pyramidal weakness, sensory impairment, and 
      dementia. Among the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, SCA7 is relatively 
      common in Scandinavia and South Africa but rare worldwide and is not previously 
      reported in Nigeria. In this study, we describe a family in Katsina State, 
      Northwest Nigeria, with nine individuals across three generations affected by the 
      SCA7 phenotype. Analysis of DNA from proband and two affected relatives revealed 
      39 CAG repeat expansions in one allele of ataxin-7 in each.

      clinical trials.
PG  - 570-8
LID - 10.1002/mds.26532 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Saccadic eye movement abnormalities are common in patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, but it is unclear how these alterations progress 
      over time. The aim of this study was to assess the progression of saccade 
      involvement in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 patients, identify its main 
      determinants, and evaluate its usefulness as outcome measures in clinical trials. 
      METHODS: A prospective 5-year follow-up study was performed with 30 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 patients and their matched healthy controls, who 
      were evaluated a total of four times by clinical and electrooculographical 
      assessments of horizontal saccades and by the scoring of ataxia. RESULTS: 
      Patients showed significant decreases in saccade peak velocity and saccade 
      accuracy as well as increases of saccadic latency during the follow-up period. 
      Annual progression rates were significantly higher in patients compared to 
      controls. Faster progression rates of saccade slowing were associated with higher 
      trinucleotide cytosine-adenine-guanine repeat expansions. Sample-size estimates 
      for two-arm trials would require 19 patients per group to detect a 50% reduction 
      in disease progression using saccade peak velocity as outcome variable, but 44 
      and 124 patients using saccade latency and accuracy, respectively (power, 80%; 
      alpha = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Electrooculographical measures of saccade changes are 
      useful for the objective quantification of disease course in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 2. The progression rate of saccade slowing is influenced by the 
      expansion size, providing novel insight into the cumulative polyglutamine 
      neurotoxicity, and supporting the usefulness of saccade peak velocity as a 
      sensitive biomarker during the natural history of the disease, and as suitable 
      outcome measure for therapeutic trials.

AB  - Expansion of a GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in the gene C9ORF72 is a common 
      pathogenic mutation in families with autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia 
      (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In order to understand whether 
      pathogenic GGGGCC expansions of C9ORF72 are associated with spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) in mainland China, we performed an experiment to determine the 
      prevalence of pathogenic hexanucleotide expansions of C9ORF72 in a large cohort 
      of Chinese Han patients with SCA. 411 sporadic patients with SCA and 314 healthy 
      controls were screened for pathogenic hexanucleotide expansions of C9ORF72 
      utilizing a repeat primed polymerase chain reaction assay. However, no 
      pathological repeat expansion of C9ORF72 was detected in either patients or 
      controls. We therefore conclude that an expansion in C9ORF72 may not play a 
      significant role in SCA in our cohort. However, more studies are needed to draw 
      conclusions for the general population.

TI  - Rapid Onset of Motor Deficits in a Mouse Model of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 6 
      Precedes Late Cerebellar Degeneration.

LID - ENEURO.0094-15.2015
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is an autosomal-dominant cerebellar ataxia 
      that has been associated with loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Disease onset is 
      typically at midlife, although it can vary widely from late teens to old age in 
      SCA6 patients. Our study focused on an SCA6 knock-in mouse model with a 
      hyper-expanded (84X) CAG repeat expansion that displays midlife-onset motor 
      deficits at  approximately 7 months old, reminiscent of midlife-onset symptoms in SCA6 
      patients, although a detailed phenotypic analysis of these mice has not yet been 
      reported. Here, we characterize the onset of motor deficits in SCA6(84Q) mice 
      using a battery of behavioral assays to test for impairments in motor 
      coordination, balance, and gait. We found that these mice performed normally on 
      these assays up to and including at 6 months, but motor impairment was detected 
      at 7 months with all motor coordination assays used, suggesting that motor 
      deficits emerge rapidly during a narrow age window in SCA6(84Q) mice. In contrast 
      to what is seen in SCA6 patients, the decrease in motor coordination was observed 
      without alterations in gait. No loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells or striatal 
      neurons were observed at 7 months, the age at which motor deficits were first 
      detected, but significant Purkinje cell loss was observed in 2-year-old SCA6(84Q) 
      mice, arguing that Purkinje cell death does not significantly contribute to the 
      early stages of SCA6.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 28: a novel AFG3L2 mutation in a German family with young 
      onset, slow progression and saccadic slowing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 28 (SCA28) is related to mutations of the 
      ATPase family gene 3-like 2 gene (AFG3L2). To date, 13 private missense mutations 
      have been identified in families of French, Italian, and German ancestry, but 
      overall, the disorder seems to be rare in Europe. Here, we report a kindred of 
      German ancestry with four affected family members presenting with slowly 
      progressive ataxia, mild pyramidal tract signs and slow saccades. METHODS: After 
      excluding repeat expansions in the genes for SCA1-3, 6-8, 10, 12, and 17, Sanger 
      sequencing of the coding regions of TTBK2 (SCA11), KCNC3 (SCA13), PRKCG (SCA14), 
      FGF14 (SCA27) and AFG3L2 (SCA28) was performed. The 17 coding exons of AFG3L2 
      with flanking intronic sequences were amplified by PCR and sequenced on both 
      strands. RESULTS: Sequencing detected a novel potential missense mutation 
      (p.Y689N) in the C-terminal proteolytic domain, the mutational hotspot of AFG3L2. 
      The online programme "PolyPhen-2" classifies this amino acid exchange as probably 
      damaging (score 0.990). Similarly to most of the published SCA28 mutations, the 
      novel mutation is located within exon 16. Mutations in exon 16 alter the 
      proteolytic activity of the protease AFG3L2 that is highly expressed in Purkinje 
      cells. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic testing should be considered in dominant ataxia with 
      pyramidal tract signs and saccadic slowing.

TI  - Genetic and clinical analysis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 in Mainland 
      China.
PG  - 141-8
LID - 10.1111/cge.12706 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36) is a new SCA subtype recently reported in 
      Japanese and Spanish pedigrees. To assess the frequency and clinical 
      characteristics of SCA36 in patients from Mainland China, we combined the 
      repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction method and Southern blot analysis to 
      detect the GGCCTG hexanucleotide repeats of NOP56 in 364 probands with SCA, 126 
      probands with hereditary spastic paraplegia and 99 probands with amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis (ALS). Systematic and targeted clinical evaluations and 
      investigations were conducted in the SCA36 patients. As a result, eight autosomal 
      dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (ADCA) pedigrees (a total of 13 patients) and one 
      sporadic SCA (S-SCA) patient were identified as SCA36 in the SCA cohort, 
      accounting for approximately 1.60% of the cases in the ADCA group and 0.32% of 
      those in the S-SCA group in Mainland China. The characteristics include late 
      onset and slow progression accompanied by acoustic impairments and 'possible' ALS 
      phenotype in patients from Mainland China.

AB  - RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a widely used technique for 
      detecting transcripts in fixed cells and tissues. Many variants of RNA FISH have 
      been proposed to increase signal strength, resolution and target specificity. The 
      current variants of this technique facilitate the detection of the subcellular 
      localization of transcripts at a single molecule level. Among the applications of 
      RNA FISH are studies on nuclear RNA foci in diseases resulting from the expansion 
      of tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide repeats present in different single 
      genes. The partial or complete retention of mutant transcripts forming RNA 
      aggregates within the nucleoplasm has been shown in multiple cellular disease 
      models and in the tissues of patients affected with these atypical mutations. 
      Relevant diseases include, among others, myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) with CUG 
      repeats, Huntington's disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) with 
      CAG repeats, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) with CGG 
      repeats, myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) with CCUG repeats, amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD) with GGGGCC repeats and 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 32 (SCA32) with GGCCUG. In this article, we summarize 
      the results obtained with FISH to examine RNA nuclear inclusions. We provide a 
      detailed protocol for detecting RNAs containing expanded CAG and CUG repeats in 
      different cellular models, including fibroblasts, lymphoblasts, induced 
      pluripotent stem cells and murine and human neuronal progenitors. We also present 
      the results of the first single-molecule FISH application in a cellular model of 
      polyglutamine disease.

AB  - A major pathological hallmark in several neurodegenerative disorders, like 
      polyglutamine disorders (polyQ), including Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), is the 
      formation of protein aggregates. MJD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the 
      ATXN3 gene, resulting in an abnormal protein, which is prone to misfolding and 
      forms cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates within neurons, ultimately inducing 
      neurodegeneration. Treatment of proteinopathies with drugs that up-regulate 
      autophagy has shown promising results in models of polyQ diseases. Temsirolimus 
      (CCI-779) inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (m-TOR), while lithium 
      chloride (LiCl) acts by inhibiting inositol monophosphatase, both being able to 
      induce autophagy. We have previously shown that chronic treatment with LiCl (10.4 
      mg/kg) had limited effects in a transgenic MJD mouse model. Also, others have 
      shown that CCI-779 had mild positive effects in a different mouse model of the 
      disease. It has been suggested that the combination of mTOR-dependent and 
      -independent autophagy inducers could be a more effective therapeutic approach. 
      To further explore this avenue toward therapy, we treated CMVMJD135 transgenic 
      mice with a conjugation of CCI-779 and LiCl, both at concentrations known to 
      induce autophagy and not to be toxic. Surprisingly, this combined treatment 
      proved to be deleterious to both wild-type (wt) and transgenic animals, failing 
      to rescue their neurological symptoms and actually exerting neurotoxic effects. 
      These results highlight the possible dangers of manipulating autophagy in the 
      nervous system and suggest that a better understanding of the potential 
      disruption in the autophagy pathway in MJD is required before successful 
      long-term autophagy modulating therapies can be developed.

TI  - MULTIMODAL IMAGING OF A FAMILY WITH SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA TYPE 7 DEMONSTRATING 
      PHENOTYPIC VARIATION AND PROGRESSION OF RETINAL DEGENERATION.
PG  - 267-72

AB  - PURPOSE: To report the variability and progression of clinical presentation in 
      three family members with spinocerebellar ataxia Type 7 including early 
      recognizable features on retinal imaging and magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS: 
      Retrospective case series. RESULTS: The proband, Patient 1 (mother) presented at 
      age 26 with light perception vision. Initial examination was significant for 
      optic disc pallor, vascular attenuation, and central macular atrophy. Two years 
      later, her vision declined to no light perception, and fundus examination 
      demonstrated marked progression of macular atrophy and peripheral bone spicule 
      formation. Seven years after the onset of vision loss, neurologic examination 
      demonstrated ataxia, dysarthria, and slowed saccades. Genetic testing of ATXN7 
      identified heterozygous 61-CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion confirming the 
      diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia Type 7. Patient 2 (son) presented at age 11 
      with visual acuity of 20/300 bilaterally and decreased color vision. Funduscopic 
      examination was notable for disc pallor, vascular attenuation, and peripheral 
      pigmentary changes. Electroretinography demonstrated diminished rod and cone 
      function, and Goldmann visual field testing revealed paracentral scotoma. Patient 
      3 (daughter) presented at age 14 with visual acuity of 20/50 bilaterally and 
      minimal funduscopic changes. The only significant ophthalmic finding was retinal 
      thinning with atrophy of the outer nuclear layer and subfoveal ellipsoid zone on 
      optical coherence tomography. Early cerebellar volume loss was also noted on 
      magnetic resonance imaging. CONCLUSION: The clinical presentation of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia Type 7 can vary widely even within the same family. In 
      individuals with vision loss and normal fundus examination, careful evaluation of 
      optical coherence tomography and brain magnetic resonance imaging facilitates 
      early diagnosis and genetic testing.

TI  - Limited Effect of Chronic Valproic Acid Treatment in a Mouse Model of 
      Machado-Joseph Disease.

AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease, caused by 
      a CAG repeat expansion within the coding region of ATXN3 gene, and which 
      currently lacks effective treatment. In this work we tested the therapeutic 
      efficacy of chronic treatment with valproic acid (VPA) (200mg/kg), a compound 
      with known neuroprotection activity, and previously shown to be effective in 
      cell, fly and nematode models of MJD. We show that chronic VPA treatment in the 
      CMVMJD135 mouse model had limited effects in the motor deficits of these mice, 
      seen mostly at late stages in the motor swimming, beam walk, rotarod and 
      spontaneous locomotor activity tests, and did not modify the ATXN3 inclusion load 
      and astrogliosis in affected brain regions. However, VPA chronic treatment was 
      able to increase GRP78 protein levels at 30 weeks of age, one of its known 
      neuroprotective effects, confirming target engagement. In spite of limited 
      results, the use of another dosage of VPA or of VPA in a combined therapy with 
      molecules targeting other pathways, cannot be excluded as potential strategies 
      for MJD therapeutics.

AB  - Despite the intense debate around the repeat instability reported on the large 
      group of neurological disorders caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions, little 
      is known about the mutation process underlying alleles in the normal range, 
      diseases range, large normal alleles (LNAs). In this study, we assessed the CAG 
      repeats at SCA17 in 188 clinical SCA patients and 100 individuals without any 
      neurological signs. This highly polymorphic population displayed high variability 
      in the CAG repeats and ranged from 19-38 CAG repeats in patients with mode of 20 
      and 19-32 CAG repeats in controls with mode of 24. The triplet repeat expansion 
      was not detected in any of the 188 patients, as per the reference pathogenic 
      range (>43 repeats); however, 2.7% of the patients had >33 CAG repeats with a 
      clinical phenotype close to what is expected of SCA 17 patients. The findings of 
      this study implicate a more sophisticated interpretation of SCA17 gene and raise 
      the question about the diagnostic thresh hold between normal and expanded repeats 
      in our population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias are dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      diseases. As potential treatments for these diseases are being developed, precise 
      knowledge of their natural history is needed. We aimed to study the long-term 
      disease progression of the most common spinocerebellar ataxias: SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, 
      and SCA6. Furthermore, we aimed to establish the order and occurrence of 
      non-ataxia symptoms, and identify predictors of disease progression. METHODS: In 
      this longitudinal cohort study (EUROSCA), we enrolled men and women with positive 
      genetic testing for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 and with progressive, otherwise 
      unexplained ataxia who were aged 18 years or older from 17 ataxia referral 
      centres in ten European countries. Patients were seen every year for 3 years, and 
      at irregular intervals thereafter. The primary outcome was the scale for the 
      assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA), and the inventory of non-ataxia signs 
      (INAS). We used linear mixed models to analyse progression. To account for 
      dropouts, we applied a pattern-mixture model. This study is registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02440763. FINDINGS: Between July 1, 2005, and Aug 
      31, 2006, 526 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 were enrolled. We analysed 
      data for 462 patients with at least one follow-up visit. Median observation time 
      was 49 months (IQR 35-72). SARA progression data were best fitted with a linear 
      model in all genotypes. Annual SARA score increase was 2.11 (SE 0.12) in patients 
      with SCA1, 1.49 (0.07) in patients with SCA2, 1.56 (0.08) in patients with SCA3, 
      and 0.80 (0.09) in patients with SCA6. The increase of the number of non-ataxia 
      signs reached a plateau in SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3. In patients with SCA6, the 
      number of non-ataxia symptoms increased linearly, but more slowly than in 
      patients with SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 (p<0.0001). Factors that were associated with 
      faster progression of the SARA score were short duration of follow-up (p=0.0179), 
      older age at inclusion (0.04 [SE 0.02] per additional year; p=0.0476), and longer 
      repeat expansions (0.06 [SE 0.02] per additional repeat unit; p=0.0128) in SCA1, 
      short duration of follow-up (p<0.0001), lower age at onset (-0.02 [SE 0.01] per 
      additional year; p=0.0014), and lower baseline SARA score (-0.02 [SE 0.01] per 
      additional SARA point; p=0.0083) in SCA2, and lower baseline SARA score (-0.03 
      [SE 0.01] per additional SARA point; p=0.0195) in SCA6. In SCA3, we did not 
      identify factors that affected progression of the SARA score. INTERPRETATION: Our 
      study provides quantitative data on the progression of the most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxias based on a follow-up period that exceeds those of 
      previous studies. Our data could prove useful for sample size calculation and 
      patient stratification in interventional trials. FUNDING: EU FP6 (EUROSCA),

AB  - BACKGROUND: About 50 % of Thai patients with adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) was Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6. The author 
      investigated further on less common SCAs in the patients without any known 
      mutations. METHODS: DNA samples of 82 index patients who were genetically 
      excluded MJD, SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) were examined. Analysis of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, SCA17 and SCA19 genes were 
      comprehensively performed. Normal range of trinucleotide repeat expansion sizes 
      of TATA-box-binding protein gene (TBP) were also determined in 374 control 
      subjects. RESULTS: Eight patients carried >/=42 CAG/CAA repeat allele in the TBP 
      consistent with SCA17. The pathological repeat alleles ranged from 42 to 57 
      repeats. All patients had significant degree of cognitive dysfunction. Other 
      non-ataxic phenotypes comprised of parkinsonism, chorea, dystonia and myoclonus. 
      A sporadic patient carried a heterozygous 41-repeat allele developed chronic 
      progressive cerebellar degeneration commenced at the age of 28 years. Whilst, 2 % 
      of the control subjects (8/374) carried the 41-repeat allele. Five of the 
      carriers were re-examined, and revealed that four of them had parkinsonism and/or 
      cognitive impairment without cerebellar signs. Analysis of other types of SCAs 
      was all negative. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA17 and SCA19 in Thais. SCA17 appears to be an important cause of ataxia in 
      Thailand. Although, the pathological cut-off point of the TBP repeat allele 
      remains unclear, the finding suggests that the 41-repeat may be a pathological 
      allele resulting late-onset or mild phenotype. Apart from ataxia, cognitive 
      impairment and parkinsonism may be clinical presentations in these carriers.

TI  - No parkinsonism in SCA2 and SCA3 despite severe neurodegeneration of the 
      dopaminergic substantia nigra.
PG  - 3316-26
LID - 10.1093/brain/awv255 [doi]
AB  - See Klockgether (doi:10.1093/awv253) for a scientific commentary on this 
      article.The spinocerebellar ataxias types 2 (SCA2) and 3 (SCA3) are autosomal 
      dominantly inherited cerebellar ataxias which are caused by CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat expansions in the coding regions of the disease-specific genes. Although 
      previous post-mortem studies repeatedly revealed a consistent neurodegeneration 
      of the dopaminergic substantia nigra in patients with SCA2 and with SCA3, 
      parkinsonian motor features evolve only rarely. As the pathophysiological 
      mechanism how SCA2 and SCA3 patients do not exhibit parkinsonism is still 
      enigmatic, we performed a positron emission tomography and a post-mortem study of 
      two independent cohorts of SCA2 and SCA3 patients with and without parkinsonian 
      features. Positron emission tomography revealed a significant reduction of 
      dopamine transporter levels in the striatum as well as largely unaffected 
      postsynaptic striatal D2 receptors. In spite of this remarkable pathology in the 
      motor mesostriatal pathway, only 4 of 19 SCA2 and SCA3 patients suffered from 
      parkinsonism. The post-mortem investigation revealed, in addition to an extensive 
      neuronal loss in the dopaminergic substantia nigra of all patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia, a consistent affection of the thalamic ventral anterior 
      and ventral lateral nuclei, the pallidum and the cholinergic pedunculopontine 
      nucleus. With the exception of a single patient with SCA3 who suffered from 
      parkinsonian motor features during his lifetime, the subthalamic nucleus 
      underwent severe neuronal loss, which was clearly more severe in its motor 
      territory than in its limbic or associative territories. Our observation that 
      lesions of the motor territory of the subthalamic nucleus were consistently 
      associated with the prevention of parkinsonism in our SCA2 and SCA3 patients 
      matches the clinical experience that selective targeting of the motor territory 
      of the subthalamic nucleus by focal lesions or deep brain stimulation can 
      ameliorate parkinsonian motor features and is likely to counteract the 
      manifestation of parkinsonism in SCA2 and SCA3 despite a severe neurodegeneration 
      of the dopaminergic substantia nigra.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: SCA12 is a progressive autosomal-dominant disorder, caused by a 
      CAG/CTG repeat expansion in PPP2R2B on chromosome 5q32, and characterized by 
      tremor, gait ataxia, hyperreflexia, dysmetria, abnormal eye movements, anxiety, 
      depression, and sometimes cognitive impairment. Neuroimaging has demonstrated 
      cerebellar and cortical atrophy. We now present the neuropathology of the first 
      autopsied SCA12 brain and utilize cell models to characterize potential 
      mechanisms of SCA12 neurodegeneration. METHODS: A fixed SCA12 brain was examined 
      using gross, microscopic, and immunohistochemical methods. The effect of the 
      repeat expansion on PPP2R2B Bbeta1 expression was examined in multiple cell types by 
      transient transfection of constructs containing the PPP2R2B Bbeta1 promoter region 
      attached to a luciferase reporter. The neurotoxic effect of PPP2R2B 
      overexpression was examined in transfected rat primary neurons. RESULTS: 
      Neuropathological investigation revealed enlarged ventricles, marked cerebral 
      cortical atrophy and Purkinje cell loss, less-prominent cerebellar and pontine 
      atrophy, and neuronal intranuclear ubiquitin-positive inclusions, consistent with 
      Marinesco bodies, which did not stain for long polyglutamine tracts, 
      alpha-synuclein, tau, or transactive response DNA-binding protein 43. Reporter 
      assays demonstrated that the region of PPP2R2B containing the repeat functions as 
      a promoter, and that promoter activity increases with longer repeat length and is 
      dependent on cell type, repeat sequence, and sequence flanking the repeat. 
      Overexpression of PPP2R2B in primary cortical neurons disrupted normal 
      morphology. CONCLUSIONS: SCA12 involves extensive, but selective, 
      neurodegeneration distinct from Alzheimer's disease, synucleinopathies, 
      tauopathies, and glutamine expansion diseases. SCA12 neuropathology may arise 
      from the neurotoxic effect of repeat-expansion-induced overexpression of PPP2R2B.

TI  - SMRT Sequencing of Long Tandem Nucleotide Repeats in SCA10 Reveals Unique Insight

AB  - A large, non-coding ATTCT repeat expansion causes the neurodegenerative disorder, 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10). In a subset of SCA10 patients, 
      interruption motifs are present at the 5' end of the expansion and strongly 
      correlate with epileptic seizures. Thus, interruption motifs are a predictor of 
      the epileptic phenotype and are hypothesized to act as a phenotypic modifier in 
      SCA10. Yet, the exact internal sequence structure of SCA10 expansions remains 
      unknown due to limitations in current technologies for sequencing across long 
      extended tracts of tandem nucleotide repeats. We used the third generation 
      sequencing technology, Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing, to obtain 
      full-length contiguous expansion sequences, ranging from 2.5 to 4.4 kb in length, 
      from three SCA10 patients with different clinical presentations. We obtained 
      sequence spanning the entire length of the expansion and identified the structure 
      of known and novel interruption motifs within the SCA10 expansion. The exact 
      interruption patterns in expanded SCA10 alleles will allow us to further 
      investigate the potential contributions of these interrupting sequences to the 
      pathogenic modification leading to the epilepsy phenotype in SCA10. Our results 
      also demonstrate that SMRT sequencing is useful for deciphering long tandem 
      repeats that pose as "gaps" in the human genome sequence.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also called Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), 
      is one of the most common SCAs worldwide and caused by a CAG repeat expansion 
      located in ATXN3 gene. Based on the CAG repeat numbers, alleles of ATXN3 can be 
      divided into normal alleles (ANs), intermediate alleles (AIs) and expanded 
      alleles (AEs). It was controversial whether the frequency of large normal alleles 
      (large ANs) is related to the prevalence of SCA3 or not. And there were huge 
      chaos in the comprehension of the specific numbers of the range of CAG repeats 
      which is fundamental for genetic analysis of SCA3. To illustrate these issues, we 
      made a novel CAG repeat ladder to detect CAG repeats of ATXN3 in 1003 unrelated 
      Chinese normal individuals and studied haplotypes defined by three single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) closed to ATXN3. We found that the number of CAG 
      repeats ranged from 13 to 49, among them, 14 was the most common number. Positive 
      skew, the highest frequency of large ANs and 4 AIs which had never been reported 
      before were found. Also, AEs and large ANs shared the same haplotypes defined by 
      the SNPs. Based on these data and other related studies, we presumed that de novo 
      mutations of ATXN3 emerging from large ANs are at least one survival mechanisms 
      of mutational ATXN3 and we can redefine the range of CAG repeats as: ANs</=44, 45 
      </=AIs </=49 and AEs>/=50.

AB  - In humans, neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease (HD) and many 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) have been found to be associated with CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion. An important RNA-mediated mechanism that causes 
      these diseases involves the binding of the splicing regulator protein MBNL1 
      (Muscleblind-like 1 protein) to expanded r(CAG) repeats. Moreover, mutant 
      huntingtin protein translated from expanded r(CAG) also yields toxic effects. To 
      discern the role of mutant RNA in these diseases, it is essential to gather 
      information about its structure. Detailed insight into the different structures 
      and conformations adopted by these mutant transcripts is vital for developing 
      therapeutics targeting them. Here, we report the crystal structure of an RNA 
      model with a r(CAG) motif, which is complemented by an NMR-based solution 
      structure obtained from restrained Molecular Dynamics (rMD) simulation studies. 
      Crystal structure data of the RNA model resolved at 2.3 A reveals non-canonical 
      pairing of adenine in 5 -CAG/3 -GAC motif samples in different syn and anti 
      conformations. The overall RNA structure has helical parameters intermediate to 
      the A- and B-forms of nucleic acids due to the global widening of major grooves 
      and base-pair preferences near internal AA loops. The comprehension of structural 
      behaviour by studying the spectral features and the dynamics also supports the 
      flexible nature of the r(CAG) motif.

AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders are a heterogeneous group of chronic progressive 
      diseases and have pathological mechanisms in common. A certain causative gene 
      identified for a particular disease may be found to play roles in more than one 
      neurodegenerative disorder. We analyzed the GGGGCC repeat expansions of C9orf72 
      gene in patients with SCA3/MJD from mainland China to determine whether the 
      C9orf72 gene plays a role in the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD. In our study, there 
      were no pathogenic repeats (>30 repeats) detected in either the patients or 
      controls. SCA3/MJD patients with intermediate/intermediate or short/intermediate 
      genotype (short: <7 repeats; intermediate: 7-30 repeats) of the GGGGCC repeats 
      had an earlier onset compared with those with short/short genotype. The presence 
      of the intermediate allele of the GGGGCC repeats in the patients decreased the 
      age at onset by nearly 3 years. Our study firstly demonstrate that the 
      development of SCA3/MJD may involve some physiological functions of the C9orf72 
      gene and provide new evidence to the hypothesis that a specific mutation 
      identified in one of the neurodegenerative disorders may be a modulator in this 
      class of diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association of repeat expansion size in 10 common 
      degenerative hereditary ataxia genes with essential tremor. These genes were 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 
      (CACNA1A), SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), 
      SCA-17 (TBP) and dentatorubral-pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA) (ATN1). METHODS: 
      Genetic analysis of repeat size in 10 degenerative hereditary ataxia loci was 
      performed in 323 essential tremor patients and 299 controls enrolled at Columbia 
      University. To test for differences in the allele distribution between patients 
      and controls, a CLUMP analysis was performed. RESULTS: None of the essential 
      tremor patients had a repeat expansion in the intermediate or pathogenic range. 
      Significant differences in the distribution of repeats in the 'normal' range for 
      SCA2 and SCA8 (both p </= 0.02) were observed between essential tremor patients and 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      SCA loci are not associated with essential tremor.

TI  - Crystallographic and Computational Analyses of AUUCU Repeating RNA That Causes 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 10 (SCA10).
PG  - 3851-9
LID - 10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00551 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is caused by a pentanucleotide repeat 
      expansion of r(AUUCU) within intron 9 of the ATXN10 pre-mRNA. The RNA causes 
      disease by a gain-of-function mechanism in which it inactivates proteins involved 
      in RNA biogenesis. Spectroscopic studies showed that r(AUUCU) repeats form a 
      hairpin structure; however, there were no high-resolution structural models prior 
      to this work. Herein, we report the first crystal structure of model r(AUUCU) 
      repeats refined to 2.8 A and analysis of the structure via molecular dynamics 
      simulations. The r(AUUCU) tracts adopt an overall A-form geometry in which 3 x 3 
      nucleotide (5')UCU(3')/(3')UCU(5') internal loops are closed by AU pairs. Helical 
      parameters of the refined structure as well as the corresponding electron density 
      map on the crystallographic model reflect dynamic features of the internal loop. 
      The computational analyses captured dynamic motion of the loop closing pairs, 
      which can form single-stranded conformations with relatively low energies. 
      Overall, the results presented here suggest the possibility for r(AUUCU) repeats 
      to form metastable A-from structures, which can rearrange into single-stranded 
      conformations and attract proteins such as heterogeneous nuclear 
      ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K). The information presented here may aid in the 
      rational design of therapeutics targeting this RNA.

TI  - Transfer of genetic therapy across human populations: molecular targets for 
      increasing patient coverage in repeat expansion diseases.
PG  - 271-6
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2015.94 [doi]
AB  - Allele-specific gene therapy aims to silence expression of mutant alleles through 
      targeting of disease-linked single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, SNP 
      linkage to disease varies between populations, making such molecular therapies 
      applicable only to a subset of patients. Moreover, not all SNPs have the 
      molecular features necessary for potent gene silencing. Here we provide knowledge 
      to allow the maximisation of patient coverage by building a comprehensive 
      understanding of SNPs ranked according to their predicted suitability toward 
      allele-specific silencing in 14 repeat expansion diseases: amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, 
      myotonic dystrophy 1, myotonic dystrophy 2, Huntington's disease and several 
      spinocerebellar ataxias. Our systematic analysis of DNA sequence variation shows 
      that most annotated SNPs are not suitable for potent allele-specific silencing 
      across populations because of suboptimal sequence features and low variability 
      (>97% in HD). We suggest maximising patient coverage by selecting SNPs with high 
      heterozygosity across populations, and preferentially targeting SNPs that lead to 
      purine:purine mismatches in wild-type alleles to obtain potent allele-specific 
      silencing. We therefore provide fundamental knowledge on strategies for 
      optimising patient coverage of therapeutics for microsatellite expansion 
      disorders by linking analysis of population genetic variation to the selection of 
      molecular targets.

TI  - Clinical Scales Predict Significant Videofluoroscopic Dysphagia in Machado Joseph 
      Disease Patients.
PG  - 260-266
LID - 10.1002/mdc3.12173 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although aspiration is one of the main causes of death in SCA, such 
      as SCA3/Machado Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), clinical studies on dysphagia are 
      lacking for these diseases. The aims of this study were to characterize dysphagia 
      in SCA3/MJD through videofluoroscopy (VF) of swallowing, correlate VF with 
      disease severity criteria and weight loss, and determine the clinical criteria 
      cutoffs for performing VF in the clinical routine, in order to detect aspiration. 
      METHODS: A cross-sectional study on 34 SCA3/MJD patients was performed. Clinical 
      and molecular data, as well as body mass index (BMI), were obtained. Neurological 
      scales, such as the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), and the 
      Swallowing Quality of Life (SWAL-QOL) questionnaire were applied. The VF scores, 
      Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale (DOSS) and penetration/aspiration scale 
      (PAS), were obtained: Moderate-to-severe scores were grouped as "significant 
      dysphagia." RESULTS: Overall, 31 of 34 individuals showed abnormal scores at VF. 
      SARA, BMI, and the domain "eating duration" of SWAL-QOL correlated with VF: Their 
      relation to significant dysphagia (DOSS <4 points or PAS >3) was evaluated 
      through receiver operating characteristic curves. A sensitivity of 100% was 
      equivalent to a cutoff of 15 points on SARA score, 23.72 kg/m(2) on BMI, and 60% 
      on eating duration-SWAL-QOL (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Significant dysphagia was not 
      related to age at onset, disease duration, or CAG repeat expansion, but with SARA 
      scores, lower BMI, and the domain eating duration of SWAL-QOL. As a guideline for 
      preventing aspiration, we suggest that SARA scores greater than 15 or eating 
      duration-SWAL-QOL lower than 60% should urge VF studies in SCA3/MJD.

AB  - A 50-year-old Japanese man showed slowly progressive gait disturbance and 
      dysarthria. Neurological examination 5 years after onset revealed slow eye 
      movement with nystagmus as well as limb and truncal ataxia. Magnetic resonance 
      imaging showed atrophy of the cerebellum and brainstem. Because genetic 
      examination revealed CAG repeat expansion of the ataxin-1 gene, the patient was 
      diagnosed with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1. Ten years after onset, he showed 
      psychiatric symptoms with cognitive impairment, and antipsychotic drugs were 
      administered. As psychiatric symptoms gradually worsened, particularly with 
      regard to resisting nursing care and shouting, the doses of the drugs were 
      increased. Although the clinicopathologic findings were generally identical to 
      previously reported spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 cases with the exception of the 
      conspicuous psychiatric symptoms, there are two notable immunohistochemical 
      findings. Firstly, numerous anti-expanded polyglutamine antibody-immunopositive 
      neuronal inclusions were extensively observed, including in the cerebral cortex 
      and limbic system, but not in the Purkinje cells. Secondly, anti-fused in sarcoma 
      antibody-immunopositive intranuclear inclusions were extensively observed. We 
      posit that the anti-expanded polyglutamine antibody-immunopositive neuronal 
      inclusions and possibly the anti-fused in sarcoma antibody-immunopositive 
      inclusions, particularly those in the neocortex and limbic system, may correspond 
      to the psychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment that were observed in the 
      patient.

TI  - SCA2 predictive testing in Cuba: challenging concepts and protocol evolution.
PG  - 265-73
LID - 10.1007/s12687-015-0226-4 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN2 gene. Cuba has the highest prevalence (6.57 
      cases/10(5) inhabitants) of SCA2 in the world. The existence of 753 affected 
      individuals and 7173 relatives at risk prompted the development in 2001 of the 
      first predictive testing program in the country. The medical records of over 1193 
      individuals, who requested the test within a 13-year period, were analyzed 
      retrospectively. The presymptomatic and the prenatal tests had uptake rates of 
      43.4 and 23.9 %, respectively. Several ethical challenges resulted from this 
      program. These include the following: (1) withdrawal due to the initial 
      protocol's length; (2) the request to participate by 16 at-risk adolescents; (3) 
      the decision made by ten out of 33 couples with a test-positive fetus to carry 
      the pregnancy to term, leading to de facto predictive testing of minors; (4) the 
      elevated frequency of the ATXN2 gene large normal alleles (>/=23 to 31 repeats) in 
      the reference population. These issues have led to major changes in the 
      guidelines of the predictive testing protocol: (1) the protocol length was 
      shortened; (2) the inclusion criteria were expanded to reach at-risk adolescents 
      with an interest in prenatal diagnosis; (3) interdisciplinary follow-up was 
      offered to families in which test-positive fetuses were not aborted; (4) prenatal 
      testing was made available to carriers of large normal alleles with >/=27 CAG 
      repeats. The profiles of the participants were similar to those reported for 
      other predictive testing programs for conditions like Huntington disease and 
      familial adenomatous polyposis. The genetic counseling practices at the community 
      level, the ample health education provided to the at-risk population, together 
      with multidisciplinary and specialized attention to the affected families, are 
      lessons from the Cuban experience that can be relevant for other international 
      teams conducting predictive testing for other late-onset neurodegenerative 
      disorders.

AB  - Conformational polymorphism of DNA is a major causative factor behind several 
      incurable trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders that arise from overexpansion 
      of trinucleotide repeats located in coding/non-coding regions of specific genes. 
      Hairpin DNA structures that are formed due to overexpansion of CAG repeat lead to 
      Huntington's disorder and spinocerebellar ataxias. Nonetheless, DNA hairpin stem 
      structure that generally embraces B-form with canonical base pairs is poorly 
      understood in the context of periodic noncanonical A...A mismatch as found in CAG 
      repeat overexpansion. Molecular dynamics simulations on DNA hairpin stems 
      containing A...A mismatches in a CAG repeat overexpansion show that A...A dictates 
      local Z-form irrespective of starting glycosyl conformation, in sharp contrast to 
      canonical DNA duplex. Transition from B-to-Z is due to the mechanistic effect 
      that originates from its pronounced nonisostericity with flanking canonical base 
      pairs facilitated by base extrusion, backbone and/or base flipping. Based on 
      these structural insights we envisage that such an unusual DNA structure of the 
      CAG hairpin stem may have a role in disease pathogenesis. As this is the first 
      study that delineates the influence of a single A...A mismatch in reversing DNA 
      helicity, it would further have an impact on understanding DNA mismatch repair.

TI  - Trehalose attenuates the gait ataxia and gliosis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      17 mice.
PG  - 800-10
LID - 10.1007/s11064-015-1530-4 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is caused by CAG/CAA repeat expansion on 
      the gene encoding a general transcription factor, TATA-box-binding protein (TBP). 
      The CAG repeat expansion leads to the reduced solubility of polyglutamine TBP and 
      induces aggregate formation. The TBP aggregation, mostly present in the cell 
      nuclei, is distinct from that in most other neurodegenerative diseases, in which 
      the aggregation is formed in cytosol or extracellular compartments. Trehalose is 
      a disaccharide issued by the Food and Drug Administration with a Generally 
      Recognized As Safe status. Lines of evidence suggest trehalose could prevent 
      protein aggregate formation in several neurodegenerative diseases, including 
      Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. In this 
      study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of trehalose on SCA17 using 
      cerebellar primary and organotypic culture systems and a mouse model. Our results 
      showed that TBP nuclear aggregation was significantly decreased in both the 
      primary and slice cultures. Trehalose (4 %) was further supplied in the drinking 
      water of SCA17 transgenic mice. We found both the gait behavior in the footprint 
      analysis and motor coordination in the rotarod task were significantly improved 
      in the trehalose-treated SCA17 mice. The cerebellar weight was increased and the 
      astrocyte gliosis was reduced in SCA17 mice after trehalose treatment. These data 
      suggest that trehalose could be a potential nontoxic treatment for SCA17.

AB  - The expansion of simple sequence CAG*CTG repeats is associated with a number of 
      inherited disorders including Huntington disease (HD), myotonic dystrophy type 1 
      and several of the spinocerebellar ataxias. Inherited disease-associated alleles 
      usually exceed 40 repeats and may be in excess of 1,000 repeats in some 
      disorders. Inherited allele length is inversely proportional to age at onset, and 
      frequent germline expansions account for the striking anticipation observed in 
      affected families. Expanded disease associated alleles are also somatically 
      unstable via a pathway that is age dependent and tissue specific, and also 
      appears to be expansion biased. Somatic expansions are thought to contribute 
      toward both tissue specificity and disease progression. Here we have examined the 
      somatic mutational dynamics in brain and peripheral tissues from an allelic 
      series of R6/2 HD transgenic mice inheriting from 52 to >700 CAG repeats. We 
      found age-dependent, tissue-specific somatic instability, with particularly large 
      expansions observed in the striatum and cortex. We also found a positive increase 
      in somatic instability with increasing allele length. Surprisingly, however, the 
      degree of somatic variation did not increase in a linear fashion, but leveled off 
      with increasing allele length. Most unexpectedly, the almost exclusive bias 
      toward the accumulation of expansions observed in mice inheriting smaller alleles 
      was lost, and a high frequency of large somatic contractions was observed in mice 
      inheriting very large alleles (>500 repeats). These data highlight the 
      bidirectional nature of CAG*CTG repeat instability and the subtle balance that 
      exists between expansion and contraction in vivo. Defining the dynamics and 
      tissue specificity of expansion and contraction is important for understanding 
      the role of genetic instability in pathophysiology and in particular the 
      development of novel therapies based on suppressing expansions and/or promoting 
      contractions.

TI  - The role of the mammalian DNA end-processing enzyme polynucleotide kinase 
      3'-phosphatase in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 pathogenesis.

AB  - DNA strand-breaks (SBs) with non-ligatable ends are generated by ionizing 
      radiation, oxidative stress, various chemotherapeutic agents, and also as base 
      excision repair (BER) intermediates. Several neurological diseases have already 
      been identified as being due to a deficiency in DNA end-processing activities. 
      Two common dirty ends, 3'-P and 5'-OH, are processed by mammalian polynucleotide 
      kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP), a bifunctional enzyme with 3'-phosphatase and 
      5'-kinase activities. We have made the unexpected observation that PNKP stably 
      associates with Ataxin-3 (ATXN3), a polyglutamine repeat-containing protein 
      mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph 
      Disease (MJD). This disease is one of the most common dominantly inherited 
      ataxias worldwide; the defect in SCA3 is due to CAG repeat expansion (from the 
      normal 14-41 to 55-82 repeats) in the ATXN3 coding region. However, how the 
      expanded form gains its toxic function is still not clearly understood. Here we 
      report that purified wild-type (WT) ATXN3 stimulates, and by contrast the mutant 
      form specifically inhibits, PNKP's 3' phosphatase activity in vitro. 
      ATXN3-deficient cells also show decreased PNKP activity. Furthermore, transgenic 
      mice conditionally expressing the pathological form of human ATXN3 also showed 
      decreased 3'-phosphatase activity of PNKP, mostly in the deep cerebellar nuclei, 
      one of the most affected regions in MJD patients' brain. Finally, long amplicon 
      quantitative PCR analysis of human MJD patients' brain samples showed a 
      significant accumulation of DNA strand breaks. Our results thus indicate that the 
      accumulation of DNA strand breaks due to functional deficiency of PNKP is 
      etiologically linked to the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD.

AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a group of neurodegenerative disorders 
      characterized by heterogeneous clinical presentation. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      7 (SCA7) is caused by an abnormal CAG repeat expansion and includes cerebellar 
      signs associated with visual loss and ophthalmoplegia. Marked anticipation and 
      dynamic mutation is observed in SCA7. Moreover, phenotype variability and very 
      early onset of symptoms may occur. In this article, a large series of Brazilian 
      patients with different SCA subtypes was evaluated, and we compared the age of 
      onset of SCA7 with other SCA. From the 26 patients with SCA7, 4 manifested their 
      symptoms before 10-year-old. Also, occasionally the parents may have the onset of 
      symptoms after their children. In conclusion, our study highlights the genetic 
      anticipation phenomenon that occurs in SCA7 families. Patients with very early 
      onset ataxia in the context of a remarkable family history, must be considered 
      and tested for SCA7.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an incurable, dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative disease of the cerebellum caused by a polyglutamine-repeat 
      expansion in the protein ataxin-1 (ATXN1). While analysis of human autopsy 
      material indicates significant glial pathology in SCA1, previous research has 
      focused on characterizing neuronal dysfunction. In this study, we characterized 
      astrocytic and microglial response in SCA1 using a comprehensive array of mouse 
      models. We have discovered that astrocytes and microglia are activated very early 
      in SCA1 pathogenesis even when mutant ATXN1 expression was limited to Purkinje 
      neurons. Glial activation occurred in the absence of neuronal death, suggesting 
      that glial activation results from signals emanating from dysfunctional neurons. 
      Finally, in all different models examined glial activation closely correlated 
      with disease progression, supporting the development of glial-based biomarkers to 
      follow disease progression.

TI  - A 7.5-Mb duplication at chromosome 11q21-11q22.3 is associated with a novel

AB  - BACKGROUND: The autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias are most commonly 
      caused by nucleotide repeat expansions followed by base-pair changes in 
      functionally important genes. Structural variation has recently been shown to 
      underlie spinocerebellar ataxia types 15 and 20. METHODS: We applied 
      single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping to determine whether structural 
      variation causes spinocerebellar ataxia in a family from France. RESULTS: We 
      identified an approximately 7.5-megabasepair duplication on chromosome 
      11q21-11q22.3 that segregates with disease. This duplication contains an 
      estimated 44 genes. Duplications at this locus were not found in control 
      individuals. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a new spastic ataxia syndrome caused 
      by a genomic duplication, which we have denoted as spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      39. Finding additional families with this phenotype will be important to identify 
      the genetic lesion underlying disease.

AB  - Trinucleotide repeat disorders (TRDs) are a set of genetic disorders caused by 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in certain genes that exceed the normal, stable 
      threshold, which varies from gene to gene. A dynamic mutation in a healthy gene 
      may increase the repeat count and result in a defective gene. At present there 
      are 14 pathogenic trinucleotide repeat disorders that are known to affect humans. 
      The occurrence of these "triplet repeat diseases" within populations ranges from 
      fairly common (Fragile X syndrome and Myotonic dystrophy type 1) to rare 
      (Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy). In the present study we report a detailed 
      scenario of TRDs in India mostly in respect to the 9 most common disorders 
      namely; Fragile X syndrome, Myotonic dystrophy type 1, Spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (type 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7), Friedreich Ataxia and Huntington Disease.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: We report the first case to date of maternally transmitted infantile 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), in which a tract of (CAG)45 expands to 
      lengths as large as (CAG)92-250. OBSERVATIONS: A 38-year-old woman with classic 
      SCA7 (and a son, who died at age 3 years) had pronounced cerebellar atrophy and a 
      renal biopsy specimen that showed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with 
      abnormal podocytes containing cytoplasmic inclusions. Polymerase chain reaction 
      amplification across the SCA7 repeat tract assessed expansion levels in tissues 
      of the affected son. High levels of somatic CAG instability were observed in 
      blood, kidney, and skeletal muscle. This transmitted expansion is considerably 
      larger than previously reported maternal transmission expansions of 5 to 10 
      gained repeats. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We document the first intertissue CAG 
      instability reported to date in patients with SCA7, similar to SCA7 mouse models. 
      Infantile SCA7, which is often paternally transmitted, can rarely arise by 
      maternal transmission, which has implications for diagnosis and counseling among 
      families of patients with SCA7.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 exists in diverse populations and can be caused by 
      a short hexanucleotide GGCCTG repeat expansion.
PG  - 986-95
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2014-309153 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36) is an autosomal-dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a large (>650) hexanucleotide GGCCTG repeat 
      expansion in the first intron of the NOP56 gene. The aim of this study is to 
      clarify the prevalence, clinical and genetic features of SCA36. METHODS: The 
      expansion was tested in 676 unrelated SCA index cases and 727 controls from 
      France, Germany and Japan. Clinical and neuropathological features were 
      investigated in available family members. RESULTS: Normal alleles ranged between 
      5 and 14 hexanucleotide repeats. Expansions were detected in 12 families in 
      France (prevalence: 1.9% of all French SCAs) including one family each with 
      Spanish, Portuguese or Chinese ancestry, in five families in Japan (1.5% of all 
      Japanese SCAs), but were absent in German patients. All the 17 SCA36 families 
      shared one common haplotype for a 7.5 kb pairs region flanking the expansion. 
      While 27 individuals had typically long expansions, three affected individuals 
      harboured small hexanucleotide expansions of 25, 30 and 31 hexanucleotide 
      repeat-units, demonstrating that such a small expansion could cause the disease. 
      All patients showed slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia frequently accompanied 
      by hearing and cognitive impairments, tremor, ptosis and reduced vibration sense, 
      with the age at onset ranging between 39 and 65 years, and clinical features were 
      indistinguishable between individuals with short and typically long expansions. 
      Neuropathology in a presymptomatic case disclosed that Purkinje cells and 
      hypoglossal neurons are affected. CONCLUSIONS: SCA36 is rare with a worldwide 
      distribution. It can be caused by a short GGCCTG expansion and associates various 
      extracerebellar symptoms.

AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that are related 
      to at least 36 different genetic loci; they are clinically characterized by 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia and are frequently accompanied by other 
      neurological and non-neurological manifestations. The relative frequency of SCA 
      varies greatly among different regions, presumably because of a founder effect or 
      local ethnicities. Between July 1998 and May 2012, we investigated 320 Brazilian 
      patients with an SCA phenotype who belonged to 150 unrelated families with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and 23 sporadic patients from 13 Brazilian 
      states. A total of 265 patients (82.8%) belonging to 131 unrelated families 
      (87.3%) were found to have a definite mutation, and SCA3 accounted for most of 
      the familial cases (70.7%), followed by SCA7 (6%), SCA1 (5.3%), SCA2 (2.7%), SCA6 
      (1.3%), SCA8 (0.7%) and SCA10 (0.7%). In the Ribeirao Preto mesoregion, which is 
      located in the northeast part of Sao Paulo State, the prevalence of SCA3 was 
      approximately 5 per 100,000 inhabitants, which is the highest prevalence found in 
      Brazil. No mutation was found in the SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA genes, and all the 
      sporadic cases remained without a molecular diagnosis. This study further 
      characterizes the spectrum of SCA mutations found in Brazilian patients, which 
      suggests the existence of regional differences and demonstrates the expansion of 
      the SCA8 locus in Brazilian families.

AB  - Trinucleotide repeats can be highly unstable, mutating far more frequently than 
      point mutations. Repeats typically mutate by addition or loss of units of the 
      repeat. CAG repeat expansions in humans trigger neurological diseases that 
      include myotonic dystrophy, Huntington disease, and several spinocerebellar 
      ataxias. In human cells, diverse mechanisms promote CAG repeat instability, and 
      in mice, the mechanisms of instability are varied and tissue-dependent. 
      Dissection of mechanistic complexity and discovery of potential therapeutics 
      necessitates quantitative and scalable screens for repeat mutation. We describe a 
      GFP-based assay for screening modifiers of CAG repeat instability in human cells. 
      The assay exploits an engineered intronic CAG repeat tract that interferes with 
      expression of an inducible GFP minigene. Like the phenotypes of many 
      trinucleotide repeat disorders, we find that GFP function is impaired by repeat 
      expansion, in a length-dependent manner. The intensity of fluorescence varies 
      inversely with repeat length, allowing estimates of repeat tract changes in live 
      cells. We validate the assay using transcription through the repeat and 
      engineered CAG-specific nucleases, which have previously been reported to induce 
      CAG repeat instability. The assay is relatively fast and should be adaptable to 
      large-scale screens of chemical and shRNA libraries.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia in the Italian Spinone dog is associated with an intronic 
      GAA repeat expansion in ITPR1.
PG  - 108-17

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia in the Italian Spinone dog breed is characterised by a 
      progressive gait abnormality that manifests from approximately 4 months of age. 
      The disorder shows an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and affected 
      individuals are usually euthanized by one year of age on welfare grounds due to 
      an inability to ambulate. Using a homozygosity mapping technique with six cases 
      and six controls, we mapped the disease locus to chromosome 20 of the canine 
      genome. Linkage analysis across an extended pedigree confirmed the association, 
      with microsatellite C20.374 achieving a maximal LOD score of 4.41. All five genes 
      within the disease-associated interval were exon resequenced, although no exonic 
      candidate mutations were identified. A targeted resequencing approach was 
      therefore adopted to sequence the entire disease-associated interval. Analysis of 
      the sequencing data revealed a GAA repeat expansion in intron 35 of ITPR1, which 
      was homozygous in all cases and heterozygous in obligate carriers. Partial 
      impairment of cerebellar ITPR1 expression in affected dogs was demonstrated by 
      immunohistochemistry. Given the association of ITPR1 mutations with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 15 (also designated SCA16) in humans and that 
      an intronic GAA repeat expansion has been shown to cause Friedreich ataxia, the 
      repeat expansion is an excellent candidate for the cause of spinocerebellar 
      ataxia in the Italian Spinone. This finding represents the first naturally 
      occurring pathogenic intronic GAA repeat expansion in a non-human species and a 
      novel mechanism for ITPR1 associated spinocerebellar ataxia.

TI  - Genetic characterization of Spinocerebellar ataxia 1 in a South Indian cohort.
PG  - 114

LID - 114
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a late onset autosomal 
      dominant cerebellar ataxia, caused by CAG triplet repeat expansion in the ATXN1 
      gene. The frequency of SCA1 occurrence is more in Southern India than in other 
      regions as observed from hospital-based studies. However there are no reports on 
      variability of CAG repeat expansion, phenotype-genotype association and founder 
      mutations in a homogenous population from India. METHODS: Genomic DNA isolated 
      from buccal mouthwash of the individuals in the cohort was used for PCR-based 
      diagnosis of SCA1. Subsequently SNP's found within the ATXN1 loci were identified 
      by Taqman allelic discrimination assays. Significance testing of the 
      genotype-phenotype associations was calculated by Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test with 
      post-hoc Dunnett's test and Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: By 
      genetic analysis of an affected population in Southern India we identified 21 
      pre-symptomatic individuals including four that were well past the average age of 
      disease onset of 44 years, 16 symptomatic and 63 normal individuals. All 
      pre-symptomatic cases harbor "pure" expansions of greater than 40 CAGs. 
      Genotyping to test for the presence of two previously identified SNPs showed a 
      founder effect of the same repeat carrying allele as in the general Indian 
      population. We show that SCA1 disease onset is significantly delayed when 
      transmission of the disease is maternal. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of early 
      disease onset in individuals with a paternally inherited allele could serve as 
      valuable information for clinicians towards early detection of SCA1 in patients 
      with affected fathers. Identification of older pre-symptomatic individuals (n = 
      4) in our cohort among individuals with a shared genetic and environmental 
      background, suggests that second site genetic or epigenetic modifiers might 
      significantly affect SCA1 disease progression. Moreover, such undetected SCA1 
      cases could underscore the true prevalence of SCA1 in India.

TI  - A knockin mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 exhibits prominent 
      aggregate pathology and aberrant splicing of the disease gene transcript.
PG  - 1211-24
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddu532 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine diseases, including spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), are 
      caused by CAG repeat expansions that encode abnormally long glutamine repeats in 
      the respective disease proteins. While the mechanisms underlying 
      neurodegeneration remain uncertain, evidence supports a proteotoxic role for the 
      mutant protein dictated in part by the specific genetic and protein context. To 
      further define pathogenic mechanisms in SCA3, we generated a mouse model in which 
      a CAG expansion of 82 repeats was inserted into the murine locus by homologous 
      recombination. SCA3 knockin mice exhibit region-specific aggregate pathology 
      marked by intranuclear accumulation of the mutant Atxn3 protein, abundant nuclear 
      inclusions and, in select brain regions, extranuclear aggregates localized to 
      neuritic processes. Knockin mice also display altered splicing of the disease 
      gene, promoting expression of an alternative isoform in which the intron 
      immediately downstream of the CAG repeat is retained. In an independent mouse 
      model expressing the full human ATXN3 disease gene, expression of this 
      alternatively spliced transcript is also enhanced. These results, together with 
      recent findings in other polyglutamine diseases, suggest that CAG repeat 
      expansions can promote aberrant splicing to produce potentially more 
      aggregate-prone isoforms of the disease proteins. This report of a SCA3 knockin 
      mouse expands the repertoire of existing models of SCA3, and underscores the 
      potential contribution of alternative splicing to disease pathogenesis in SCA3 
      and other polyglutamine disorders.

TI  - Cross-talking noncoding RNAs contribute to cell-specific neurodegeneration in 
      SCA7.
PG  - 955-961
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2902 [doi]
AB  - What causes the tissue-specific pathology of diseases resulting from mutations in 
      housekeeping genes? Specifically, in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG-repeat expansion in ATXN7 (which 
      encodes an essential component of the mammalian transcription coactivation 
      complex, STAGA), the factors underlying the characteristic progressive cerebellar 
      and retinal degeneration in patients were unknown. We found that STAGA is 
      required for the transcription initiation of miR-124, which in turn mediates the 
      post-transcriptional cross-talk between lnc-SCA7, a conserved long noncoding RNA, 
      and ATXN7 mRNA. In SCA7, mutations in ATXN7 disrupt these regulatory interactions 
      and result in a neuron-specific increase in ATXN7 expression. Strikingly, in mice 
      this increase is most prominent in the SCA7 disease-relevant tissues, namely the 
      retina and cerebellum. Our results illustrate how noncoding RNA-mediated feedback 
      regulation of a ubiquitously expressed housekeeping gene may contribute to 
      specific neurodegeneration.

TI  - Role of dynamic and mitochondrial mutations in neurodegenerative diseases with

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia is a growing group of hereditary neurodegenerative 
      diseases for which >/=30 different genetic loci have been identified. In this 
      study, we assessed the repeats at eight spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) loci in 188 
      clinical SCA patients and 100 individuals without any neurological signs. Results 
      from the present study were able to identify 16/188 (8.5%) clinical ataxia 
      patients with repeat expansions in the pathological range of SCA genes, with the 
      majority having expansion at the SCA1, 2, and 3 loci. The present study further 
      evaluated two mitochondrial mutations associated with ataxia, i.e., T8993G and 
      A8344G. Six patients were identified with A8344G mutation and none had the 
      mutation in ATPase 6 gene; however, G8994A variation was found in three cases. 
      Overall, three cases had triplet repeat expansions as well as mitochondrial (mt) 
      mutations, which indicates potential association of triplet repeat expansions and 
      mitochondrial mutations. Both the molecular analysis of several SCA loci and two 
      relevant mt mutations indicated that the majority of ataxia cases were still 
      undiagnosed; hence, the following hypotheses were proposed and tested based on 
      available data: (i) lower repeats than normal range and (ii) large normal alleles 
      (LNAs) at multiple loci may be an alternative basis for disease pathogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are autosomal-dominant 
      neurodegenerative diseases that are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. 
      SCAs are characterized by a range of neurological symptoms. SCA12 is an 
      autosomal-dominant (AD) ataxia caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation in a 
      presumed promoter region of the gene PPP2R2B in a non-coding region on chromosome 
      5q32. This study sought to determine changes in different positions in a single 
      Uyghur SCA12 pedigree by measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and 
      fractional anisotropy (FA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single Uyghur pedigree was 
      collected and was confirmed to possess SCA12 by genetic diagnosis, among which 13 
      cases were patients and 54 cases were "healthy" individuals. Five patients were 
      presymptomatic and 15 individuals selected as a control group were examination in 
      the same time. DTI was performed on a 1.5T scanner, with b=1000 s/mm2 and 15 
      directions. ADC and FA were measured by regions of interest positioned in the 
      corticospinal tract at the level of the pons (pons), superior peduncle (SCP), 
      middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), cerebellar cortex (CeC), cerebral cortex (CC), 
      and cerebellar vermis (CV) white matter. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the 
      ADC was significantly elevated in the CeC, SCP, CC, and CV regions in SCA12 
      patients. The FA significantly decreased in the CC region in SCA12 patients and 
      the CC and CV regions in SCA12 presymptomatic patients. The course of the 
      disease, SARA score, and ADC values in CV showed highly positive correlations. 
      CONCLUSIONS: SCA12 pedigree patients exhibited microstructural damage in the 
      brain white matter. The damage in white matter fiber may first occur in the CC 
      and CV regions in SCA12 presymptomatic patients. The ADC values in the CV region 
      could reflect disease severity in SCA12 patients.

TI  - Decreased expression of glutamate transporter GLAST in Bergmann glia is 
      associated with the loss of Purkinje neurons in the spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      1.
PG  - 8-11
LID - 10.1007/s12311-014-0605-0 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease of the cerebellum caused by a polyglutamine-repeat expansion in the 
      protein ATXN1. We have previously demonstrated that astrocytic activation occurs 
      early in pathogenesis, correlates with disease progression, and can occur when 
      mutant ATXN1 expression is limited to Purkinje neurons. We now show that 
      expression of glutamate and aspartate transporter, GLAST, is decreased in 
      cerebellar astrocytes in a mouse model of SCA1. This decrease occurs in non-cell 
      autonomous manner late in disease and correlates well with the loss of Purkinje 
      neurons. Astrogliosis or decreased neuronal activity does not correlate with 
      diminished GLAST expression. In addition, Bergmann glia remain capable of 
      transcriptional upregulation of GLAST in response to improvement in Purkinje 
      neurons supporting the notion of active neuron-glia crosstalk in disease.

AB  - CAG expansion within the exon 1 of ataxin-2 (ATXN2) gene responsible for 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-2 (SCA2) has been reported to cause pure parkinsonism and 
      other neurodegenerative disorders. However, it remains unclear whether CAG 
      expansion is the only cause for SCA2 and its clinical alternatives, and whether 
      extra mutations exist to modify the phenotypic diversity. To address this, we 
      have conducted fine genetic mapping and exome sequencing for a large Chinese SCA2 
      pedigree predominantly manifesting parkinsonism (called SCA2-P). In addition, we 
      compared the CAG expansions between the SCA2-P and 16 SCA2 families presenting as 
      pure ataxia (SCA2-A). As a result, CAG repeat expansions, ranging from 37 to 40 
      copies, were detected among 10 affected and 8 nonsymptomatic members of the 
      SCA2-P family. The CAG repeats in the diseased alleles were interrupted by CAA in 
      the 3'-end. In contrast, CAG expansion ranging from 36 to 54 without CAA 
      interruption was detected in all probands of the SCA2-A families. Genetic mapping 
      located the SCA2-P pedigree on 12q24.21, which spans the ATXN2 gene. Exome 
      sequencing for 3 patients and 1 normal member revealed no extra mutations in this 
      family. In addition, by genotyping single-nucleotide polymorphisms around SCA2 
      locus, we have excluded the existence of haplotypes predisposing different 
      patterns of CAG expansion. These results demonstrate that the ATXN2 CAG expansion 
      is the sole causative mutation responsible for SCA2-P, and that genetic modifiers 
      may not be the major cause of the phenotypic diversity of SCA2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a clinically 
      heterogeneous disorder characterized predominantly by tremor, followed by late 
      onset gait ataxia, autonomic dysfunction and/or cognitive impairment. We aimed to 
      screen FMR1-CGG repeats in our cohort of progressive late-onset cerebellar 
      ataxia/tremor cohort to characterize the occurrence of FXTAS in India. METHODS: 
      We have screened FMR1-CGG repeats in 109 patients and 173 healthy control 
      subjects. Our cohort comprised: a)group of patients with predominant cerebellar 
      ataxia and/or tremor. b.)suspected cases of MSA and c.)patients who presented 
      SCA12-like neurological manifestations (late onset predominant tremor and/or 
      ataxia). All the cases were ruled out for known triplet-repeat-expansion (TRE) 
      SCA mutations. RESULTS: We have found three FMR1-premutation carriers among the 
      cases. Two of them (with CGG-96 and CGG-102) were under evaluation for their 
      SCA12-like manifestations and another (CGG-78) had progressive gait ataxia. 
      Overall the frequency of FXTAS in our cohort was found to be 3.3% among cases of 
      late onset cerebellar-ataxia/tremor; however, incidences were higher among cases 
      with SCA12-like syndrome (9%, 2/23). CONCLUSION: Finding FXTAS in patients with 
      SCA12-like manifestation suggests that TRE in the 5'UTR of the gene is the common 
      cue connecting two disorders with common phenotype of tremor/ataxia. This 
      knowledge might shed light upon their sharing of molecular neuropathology.

TI  - Modifiers of (CAG)(n) instability in Machado-Joseph disease (MJD/SCA3) 
      transmissions: an association study with DNA replication, repair and 
      recombination genes.
PG  - 1311-8
LID - 10.1007/s00439-014-1467-8 [doi]
AB  - Twelve neurological disorders are caused by gene-specific CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions that are highly unstable upon transmission to offspring. This 
      intergenerational repeat instability is clinically relevant since disease onset, 
      progression and severity are associated with repeat size. Studies of model 
      organisms revealed the involvement of some DNA replication and repair genes in 
      the process of repeat instability, however, little is known about their role in 
      patients. Here, we used an association study to search for genetic modifiers of 
      (CAG)n instability in 137 parent-child transmissions in Machado-Joseph disease 
      (MJD/SCA3). With the hypothesis that variants in genes involved in DNA 
      replication, repair or recombination might alter the MJD CAG instability 
      patterns, we screened 768 SNPs from 93 of these genes. We found a variant in 
      ERCC6 (rs2228528) associated with an expansion bias of MJD alleles. When using a 
      gene-gene interaction model, the allele combination G-A (rs4140804-rs2972388) of 
      RPA3-CDK7 is also associated with MJD instability in a direction-dependent 
      manner. Interestingly, the transcription-coupled repair factor ERCC6 (aka CSB), 
      the single-strand binding protein RPA, and the CDK7 kinase part of the TFIIH 
      transcription repair complex, have all been linked to transcription-coupled 
      repair. This is the first study performed in patient samples to implicate 
      specific modifiers of CAG instability in humans. In summary, we found variants in 
      three transcription-coupled repair genes associated with the MJD mutation that 
      points to distinct mechanisms of (CAG)n instability.

TI  - Characteristic RNA foci of the abnormal hexanucleotide GGCCUG repeat expansion in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (Asidan).
PG  - 1377-86
LID - 10.1111/ene.12491 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36), also called 
      Asidan, is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder identified as a 
      hexanucleotide GGCCTG repeat expansion in the first intron 1 of the NOP56 gene. 
      In the present study, for the first time an autopsy sample from an Asidan patient 
      was examined and cytoplasmic inclusions and (GGCCUG)n repeat RNA foci were 
      detected. METHODS: Hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemical staining, 
      as well as fluorescence in situ hybridization were used to investigate the 
      cytoplasmic inclusions of ubiquitin and p62 and the (GGCCUG)n repeat RNA foci. 
      RESULTS: The present study showed both ubiquitin- and p62-positive inclusions in 
      the cytoplasm of the inferior olivary nucleus of the Asidan patient, (GGCCUG)n 
      RNA foci in neuronal nuclei of the cerebrum, cerebellum, inferior olive, spinal 
      cord and temporal muscle, and three types of RNA foci, i.e. single small, 
      multiple small and giant. Of interest is that the giant RNA foci, nearly 10 mum in 
      diameter, that were detected in Purkinje cells, spinal motor neurons and most 
      frequently in the inferior olivary nucleus, may be responsible for pivotal 
      clinical symptoms of Asidan. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first report 
      to show neuronal cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and giant RNA foci in an Asidan 
      patient. The relationships between the giant RNA foci and neurodegeneration have 
      yet to be studied.

TI  - Modulation of the age at onset in spinocerebellar ataxia by CAG tracts in various 
      genes.
PG  - 2444-55
LID - 10.1093/brain/awu174 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine-coding (CAG)n repeat expansions in seven different genes cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxias. Although the size of the expansion is negatively 
      correlated with age at onset, it accounts for only 50-70% of its variability. To 
      find other factors involved in this variability, we performed a regression 
      analysis in 1255 affected individuals with identified expansions (spinocerebellar 
      ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7), recruited through the European Consortium on 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxias, to determine whether age at onset is influenced by the 
      size of the normal allele in eight causal (CAG)n-containing genes (ATXN1-3, 6-7, 
      17, ATN1 and HTT). We confirmed the negative effect of the expanded allele and 
      detected threshold effects reflected by a quadratic association between age at 
      onset and CAG size in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 3 and 6. We also evidenced 
      an interaction between the expanded and normal alleles in trans in individuals 
      with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 6 and 7. Except for individuals with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, age at onset was also influenced by other 
      (CAG)n-containing genes: ATXN7 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2; ATXN2, ATN1 and 
      HTT in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3; ATXN1 and ATXN3 in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 6; and ATXN3 and TBP in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7. This suggests that 
      there are biological relationships among these genes. The results were partially 
      replicated in four independent populations representing 460 Caucasians and 216 
      Asian samples; the differences are possibly explained by ethnic or geographical 
      differences. As the variability in age at onset is not completely explained by 
      the effects of the causative and modifier sister genes, other genetic or 
      environmental factors must also play a role in these diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA)--SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and 
      SCA6--are caused by (CAG)n repeat expansion. While the number of repeats of the 
      coding (CAG)n expansions is correlated with the age at onset, there are no 
      appropriate models that include both affected and preclinical carriers allowing 
      for the prediction of age at onset. METHODS: We combined data from two major 
      European cohorts of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6 mutation carriers: 1187 affected 
      individuals from the EUROSCA registry and 123 preclinical individuals from the 
      RISCA cohort. For each SCA genotype, a regression model was fitted using a 
      log-normal distribution for age at onset with the repeat length of the alleles as 
      covariates. From these models, we calculated expected age at onset from birth and 
      conditionally that this age is greater than the current age. RESULTS: For SCA2 
      and SCA3 genotypes, the expanded allele was a significant predictor of age at 
      onset (-0.105+/-0.005 and -0.056+/-0.003) while for SCA1 and SCA6 genotypes both the 
      size of the expanded and normal alleles were significant (expanded: -0.049+/-0.002 
      and -0.090+/-0.009, respectively; normal: +0.013+/-0.005 and -0.029+/-0.010, 
      respectively). According to the model, we indicated the median values (90% 
      critical region) and the expectancy (SD) of the predicted age at onset for each 
      SCA genotype according to the CAG repeat size and current age. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      estimations can be valuable in clinical and research. However, results need to be 
      confirmed in other independent cohorts and in future longitudinal studies.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative and incurable 
      hereditary disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation on ATXN2 gene. The 
      identification of reliable biochemical markers of disease severity is of 
      paramount significance for the development and assessment of clinical trials. In 
      order to evaluate the potential use of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity 
      as a biomarker for SCA2, a case-control study in 38 affected, presymptomatic 
      individuals or healthy controls was conducted. An enlarged sample of 121 affected 
      individuals was set to assess the impact of GST activity on SCA2 clinical 
      expression. There was a significant increase in GST activity in affected 
      individuals relative to controls, although sensibility and specificity were not 
      high. GST activity was not significantly influenced by sex, age, disease duration 
      or CAG repeat size and did not significantly influence disease severity markers. 
      These findings show a disruption of in vivo GST activity in SCA2, suggesting a 
      role for oxidative stress in the neurodegenerative process.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17 and 
      dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy, as well as Huntington disease, are a group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders caused by a CAG triplet-repeat expansion encoding a 
      long polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the respective mutant proteins. The 
      cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregate formation, a pathological hallmark of polyQ 
      diseases, is probably the initial process triggering the subsequent pathological 
      events. Compromised oxidative stress defense capacity and mitochondrial 
      dysfunction have emerged as contributing factors to the pathogenesis of polyQ 
      diseases. The roots of licorice (Glycyrrhiza species) have long been used as an 
      herbal medicine. In this study, we demonstrate the aggregate-inhibitory effect of 
      Glycyrrhiza inflata herb extract and its constituents licochalcone A and ammonium 
      glycyrrhizinate (AMGZ) in both 293 and SH-SY5Y ATXN3/Q75 cells, SCA3 cell models. 
      The reporter assay showed that G. inflata herb extract, licochalcone A, and AMGZ 
      could enhance the promoter activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
      gamma, coactivator 1alpha (PPARGC1A), a known regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and 
      antioxidative response genes. G. inflata extract, licochalcone A, and AMGZ 
      upregulated PPARGC1A expression and its downstream target genes, SOD2 and CYCS, 
      in the 293 ATXN3/Q75 cell model. The expression of nuclear factor erythroid 
      2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2), the principal transcription factor that binds to 
      antioxidant-responsive elements (AREs) to promote ARE-dependent gene expression 
      when the cells respond to oxidative stress, and its downstream genes, HMOX1, 
      NQO1, GCLC, and GSTP1, was also increased by G. inflata herb extract, 
      licochalcone A, and AMGZ. Knockdown of PPARGC1A increased aggregates in ATXN3/Q75 
      cells and also attenuated the aggregate-inhibiting effect of the tested 
      compounds. G. inflata extract and its constituents significantly elevated 
      GSH/GSSG ratio and reduced reactive oxidative species in ATXN3/Q75 cells. The 
      study results suggest that the tested agents activate PPARGC1A activity and 
      NFE2L2-ARE signaling to increase mitochondrial biogenesis, decrease oxidative 
      stress, and reduce aggregate formation in SCA3 cellular models.

TI  - Allele-specific silencing of mutant Ataxin-7 in SCA7 patient-derived fibroblasts.
PG  - 1369-75
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2014.39 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders are inherited neurodegenerative conditions 
      defined by a common pathogenic CAG repeat expansion leading to a toxic 
      gain-of-function of the mutant protein. Consequences of this toxicity include 
      activation of heat-shock proteins (HSPs), impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome 
      pathway and transcriptional dysregulation. Several studies in animal models have 
      shown that reducing levels of toxic protein using small RNAs would be an ideal 
      therapeutic approach for such disorders, including spinocerebellar ataxia-7 
      (SCA7). However, testing such RNA interference (RNAi) effectors in genetically 
      appropriate patient cell lines with a disease-relevant phenotype has yet to be 
      explored. Here, we have used primary adult dermal fibroblasts from SCA7 patients 
      and controls to assess the endogenous allele-specific silencing of ataxin-7 by 
      two distinct siRNAs. We further identified altered expression of two 
      disease-relevant transcripts in SCA7 patient cells: a twofold increase in levels 
      of the HSP DNAJA1 and a twofold decrease in levels of the de-ubiquitinating 
      enzyme, UCHL1. After siRNA treatment, the expression of both genes was restored 
      towards normal levels. To our knowledge, this is the first time that 
      allele-specific silencing of mutant ataxin-7, targeting a common SNP, has been 
      demonstrated in patient cells. These findings highlight the advantage of an 
      allele-specific RNAi-based therapeutic approach, and indicate the value of 
      primary patient-derived cells as useful models for mechanistic studies and for 
      measuring efficacy of RNAi effectors on a patient-to-patient basis in the polyQ 
      diseases.

TI  - The histone deacetylase HDAC3 is essential for Purkinje cell function, 
      potentially complicating the use of HDAC inhibitors in SCA1.
PG  - 3733-45
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddu081 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a pathogenic glutamine repeat expansion in the protein ataxin-1 
      (ATXN1). One likely mechanism mediating pathogenesis is excessive transcriptional 
      repression induced by the expanded ATXN-1. Because ATXN1 binds HDAC3, a Class I 
      histone deacetylase (HDAC) that we have found to be required for ATXN1-induced 
      transcriptional repression, we tested whether genetically depleting HDAC3 
      improves the phenotype of the SCA1 knock-in mouse (SCA1(154Q/2Q)), the most 
      physiologically relevant model of SCA1. Given that HDAC3 null mice are embryonic 
      lethal, we used for our analyses a combination of HDAC3 haploinsufficient and 
      Purkinje cell (PC)-specific HDAC3 null mice. Although deleting a single allele of 
      HDAC3 in the context of SCA1 was insufficient to improve cerebellar and cognitive 
      deficits of the disease, a complete loss of PC HDAC3 was highly deleterious both 
      behaviorally, with mice showing early onset ataxia, and pathologically, with 
      progressive histologic evidence of degeneration. Inhibition of HDAC3 may yet have 
      a role in SCA1 therapy, but our study provides cautionary evidence that this 
      approach could produce untoward effects. Indeed, the neurotoxic consequences of 
      HDAC3 depletion could prove relevant, wherever pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC3 
      is being contemplated, in disorders ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) and familial 
      hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1) are allelic disorders of the gene CACNA1A 
      encoding the P/Q subunit of a voltage gated calcium channel. While SCA6 is 
      related to repeat expansions affecting the C-terminal part of the protein, EA2 
      and FHM phenotypes are usually associated with nonsense and missense mutations 
      leading to impaired channel properties. In three unrelated families with dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia, symptoms cosegregated with CACNA1A missense mutations of 
      evolutionary highly conserved amino acids (exchanges p.E668K, p.R583Q and 
      p.D302N). To evaluate pathogenic effects, in silico, protein modeling analyses 
      were performed which indicate structural alterations of the novel mutation 
      p.E668K within the homologous domain 2 affecting CACNA1A protein function. The 
      phenotype is characterised by a very slowly progressive ataxia, while ataxic 
      episodes or migraine are uncommon. These findings enlarge the phenotypic spectrum 
      of CACNA1A mutations.

TI  - Downregulation of proteins involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response 
      and Nrf2-ARE signaling in lymphoblastoid cells of spinocerebellar ataxia type 17.
PG  - 601-10
LID - 10.1007/s00702-013-1157-z [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is caused by CAG repeat expansion in the 
      TATA-box binding protein gene. Studies of several polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion 
      diseases have suggested that the expanded polyQ proteins misfold and induce 
      oxidative stress to contribute to cell death. Substantial deficits in peripheral 
      tissues including lymphocytes have been shown and these peripheral abnormalities 
      could also be found in neurons possessing polyQ disease proteins. In this study, 
      we used a lymphoblastoid cell model to investigate the functional implication of 
      SCA17 expanded alleles and assess the potential therapeutic strategies that may 
      ameliorate the effects of expanded polyQ. Proteomics studies of patient/control 
      pairs including two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and 
      immunoblotting were conducted. A total of 8 proteins with reduced expression 
      changes greater than 1.3-fold were identified, including previously reported 
      HSPA5 and HSPA8. Among 6 proteins further semi-quantified by immunoblotting and 
      real-time PCR, the reduced expression of HYOU1, PDIA3, P4HB, NQO1 and HMOX1 was 
      confirmed. Treatment with resveratrol and genipin up-regulated NQO1 and HMOX1 
      expression and reduced oxidative stress in patients' lymphoblastoid cells. The 
      results illustrate downregulation of proteins involved in the endoplasmic 
      reticulum stress response (HYOU1, HSPA5, PDIA3, and P4HB) and Nrf2-ARE signaling 
      (NQO1 and HMOX1) in SCA17 lymphoblastoid cells. Compounds increasing 
      anti-oxidative activity such as resveratrol and genipin may serve as a potential 
      therapeutic strategy for SCA17.

TI  - Repeat interruptions in spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 expansions are strongly 
      associated with epileptic seizures.
PG  - 59-64
LID - 10.1007/s10048-013-0385-6 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10), an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder, is the result of a non-coding, pentanucleotide repeat expansion within 
      intron 9 of the Ataxin 10 gene. SCA10 patients present with pure cerebellar 
      ataxia; yet, some families also have a high incidence of epilepsy. SCA10 
      expansions containing penta- and heptanucleotide interruption motifs, termed 
      "ATCCT interruptions," experience large contractions during germline 
      transmission, particularly in paternal lineages. At the same time, these alleles 
      confer an earlier age at onset which contradicts traditional rules of genetic 
      anticipation in repeat expansions. Previously, ATCCT interruptions have been 
      associated with a higher prevalence of epileptic seizures in one Mexican-American 
      SCA10 family. In a large cohort of SCA10 families, we analyzed whether ATCCT 
      interruptions confer a greater risk for developing seizures in these families. 
      Notably, we find that the presence of repeat interruptions within the SCA10 
      expansion confers a 6.3-fold increase in the risk of an SCA10 patient developing 
      epilepsy (6.2-fold when considering patients of Mexican ancestry only) and a 
      13.7-fold increase in having a positive family history of epilepsy (10.5-fold 
      when considering patients of Mexican ancestry only). We conclude that the 
      presence of repeat interruptions in SCA10 repeat expansion indicates a 
      significant risk for the epilepsy phenotype and should be considered during 
      genetic counseling.

AB  - Limited data exist on the spectrum of heredoataxias in Greece, including the 
      prevalence and phenotype of Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) and the prevalence and 
      subtypes of dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). We analyzed clinically and 
      investigated genetically for FRDA and triplet-repeat expansion SCAs a consecutive 
      series of 186 patients with suspected heredoataxia referred to Athens over 18 
      years. For prevalence estimates we included patients with molecular diagnosis 
      from Cyprus that were absent from the Athens cohort. The minimum prevalence of 
      FRDA was ~0.9/100,000, with clusters of high prevalence in Aegean islands. FRDA 
      was diagnosed in 73 probands. The genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of FRDA was 
      similar to other populations, with one patient compound heterozygote for a known 
      point mutation in FXN (Asn146Lys). Undiagnosed recessive ataxias included 
      FRDA-like and spastic ataxias. The minimum prevalence of dominant SCAs was 
      ~0.7/100,000. SCA1 (4), SCA7 (4), SCA2, SCA6, and SCA17 (1 each) probands were 
      identified. A molecular diagnosis was reached in 31% of dominant cases. 
      Undiagnosed dominant patients included a majority of type III autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxias. FRDA is the commonest heredoataxia in the Greek population 
      with prevalence towards the lower end of other European populations. Dominant 
      SCAs are almost as prevalent. SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and SCA17 patients complete 
      the spectrum of cases with a specific molecular diagnosis.

PG  - 1302-4
AB  - IMPORTANCE: A family with coexistence of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 and 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is described. OBSERVATIONS: Intermediate or 
      full CAG repeat expansions of ATXN2 are associated with ALS. However, no 
      coexistence of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 and ALS in a family has been 
      reported in the literature.We describe a 47-year-old woman with an 11-year 
      history of ataxia and her paternal uncle with ALS who were evaluated at Columbia 
      University Medical Center since July 2006. Both our patient with ataxia and her 
      uncle with ALS have full pathological CAG repeat expansions of ATXN2. CONCLUSIONS 
      AND RELEVANCE: The diverse clinical phenotypes of ATXN2 CAG expansions and their 
      coexistence in a single family are highlighted. A clinician should consider the 
      diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 when encountering a patient with 
      ataxia and a family history of ALS.

TI  - Origin of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 gene mutation in Mexican population.
PG  - 902-5
LID - 10.1007/s12311-013-0505-8 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia associated with macular 
      degeneration that leads, in the majority of patients, to loss of autonomy and 
      blindness. The cause of the disease has been identified as (CAG) n repeat 
      expansion in the coding sequence of the ATXN7 gene on chromosome 3p21.1. SCA7 is 
      one of the least common genetically verified autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxias found worldwide; however, we previously identified the Mexican population 
      showing high prevalence of SCA7, suggesting the occurrence of a common founder 
      effect. In this study, haplotype analysis using four SCA7 gene-linked markers 
      revealed that all 72 SCA7 carriers studied share a common haplotype, A-254-82-98, 
      for the intragenic marker 3145G/A and centromeric markers D3S1287, D3S1228, and 
      D3S3635, respectively. This multiloci combination is uncommon in healthy 
      relatives and Mexican general population, suggesting that a single ancestral 
      mutation is responsible for all SCA7 cases in this population. Furthermore, 
      genotyping using 17 short tandem repeat markers from the non-recombining region 
      of the Y chromosome and further phylogenetic relationship analysis revealed that 
      Mexican patients possess the Western European ancestry, which might trace the 
      SCA7 ancestral mutation to that world region.

PG  - 173-92
LID - 10.1007/978-1-62703-438-8_13 [doi]
AB  - Expansion of repeat sequences beyond a pathogenic threshold is the cause of a 
      series of dominantly inherited neurodegenerative diseases that includes 
      Huntington's disease, several spinocerebellar ataxias, and myotonic dystrophy 
      types 1 and 2. Expansion of repeat sequences occurring in coding regions of 
      various genes frequently produces an expanded polyglutamine tract that is thought 
      to result in a toxic protein. However, in a number of diseases that present with 
      similar clinical symptoms, the expansions occur in untranslated regions of the 
      gene that cannot encode toxic peptide products. As expanded repeat-containing RNA 
      is common to both translated and untranslated repeat expansion diseases, this 
      repeat RNA is hypothesized as a potential common toxic agent.We have established 
      Drosophila models for expanded repeat diseases in order to investigate the role 
      of multiple candidate toxic agents and the potential molecular pathways that lead 
      to pathogenesis. In this chapter we describe methods to identify candidate 
      pathogenic pathways and their constituent steps. This includes establishing novel 
      phenotypes using Drosophila and developing methods for using this system to 
      screen for possible modifiers of pathology. Additionally, we describe a method 
      for quantifying progressive neurodegeneration using a motor functional assay as 
      well as small RNA profiling techniques, which are useful in identifying RNA 
      intermediates of pathogenesis that can then be used to validate potential 
      pathogenic pathways in humans.

      the TATA-binding protein (TBP) has shown age related motor deficit using a 
      classic motor test, yet concomitant weight increase might be a confounding factor 
      for this measurement. In this study we used an automated home cage system to test 
      several motor readouts for this same model to confirm pathological behavior 
      results and evaluate benefits of automated home cage in behavior phenotyping. Our 
      results confirm motor deficits in the Tbp/Q71 mice and present previously 
      unrecognized behavioral characteristics obtained from the automated home cage, 
      indicating its use for high-throughput screening and testing, e.g. of therapeutic 
      compounds.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the 
      ataxin-3 protein, resulting in gain of toxic function of the mutant protein. The 
      expanded glutamine stretch in the protein is the result of a CAG triplet repeat 
      expansion in the penultimate exon of the ATXN3 gene. Several gene silencing 
      approaches to reduce mutant ataxin-3 toxicity in this disease aim to lower 
      ataxin-3 protein levels, but since this protein is involved in deubiquitination 
      and proteasomal protein degradation, its long-term silencing might not be 
      desirable. Here, we propose a novel protein modification approach to reduce 
      mutant ataxin-3 toxicity by removing the toxic polyglutamine repeat from the 
      ataxin-3 protein through antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping while 
      maintaining important wild type functions of the protein. In vitro studies showed 
      that exon skipping did not negatively impact the ubiquitin binding capacity of 
      ataxin-3. Our in vivo studies showed no toxic properties of the novel truncated 
      ataxin-3 protein. These results suggest that exon skipping may be a novel 
      therapeutic approach to reduce polyglutamine-induced toxicity in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 3.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder with 
      unclear etiology. Recently, intermediate CAG repeat expansions in ATXN2, the gene 
      responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), have been identified as a 
      possible genetic risk factor for ALS. In this study, we analyzed the ATXN2 CAG 
      repeat length in Chinese patients with ALS to evaluate the relationship between 
      the genotype and phenotype. We studied 1,067 patients with ALS and 506 controls 
      from mainland China (excluding Tibet). We collected clinical data and analyzed 
      fluorescent PCR products to assess ATXN2 CAG repeat length in all of the samples. 
      We observed that intermediate CAG repeat expansions in ATXN2 (CAG repeat length 
      >30) were associated with ALS (p = 0.004). There was no significant difference in 
      clinical characteristics between the groups with and without intermediate CAG 
      repeat expansions in ATXN2. Our data indicate that, for ALS patients from 
      mainland China, intermediate CAG repeat expansions in ATXN2 increase the risk of 
      ALS but have no effect on disease phenotype.

TI  - Abnormal RNA structures (RNA foci) containing a penta-nucleotide repeat (UGGAA)n

      pathogenesis.
PG  - 600-11

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 (SCA31) is an autosomal-dominant cerebellar ataxia 
      showing a Purkinje cell (PC)-predominant neurodegeneration in humans. The 
      mutation is a complex penta-nucleotide repeat containing (TGGAA)n , (TAGAA)n , 
      (TAAAA)n and (TAGAATAAAA)n inserted in an intron shared by two different genes 
      BEAN1 and TK2 located in the long arm of the human chromosome 16. Previous 
      studies have shown that (TGGAA)n is the critical component of SCA31 pathogenesis 
      while the three other repeats, also present in normal Japanese, are not 
      essential. Importantly, it has been shown that BEAN1 and TK2 are transcribed in 
      mutually opposite directions in the human brain. Furthermore, abnormal RNA 
      structures called "RNA foci" are observed by a probe against (UAGAAUAAAA)n in 
      SCA31 patients' PC nuclei, indicating that the BEAN1-direction mutant transcript 
      appears instrumental for the pathogenesis. However, it is not known whether the 
      critical repeat (TGGAA)n contributes to the formation of RNA foci, neither do we 
      understand how the RNA foci formation is relevant to the pathogenesis. To address 
      these issues, we investigated two SCA31 cerebella by fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization using a probe against (UGGAA)n . We also asked whether the mutant 
      BEAN1-transcript containing (UGGAA)n exerts toxicity compared to the other three 
      repeats in cultured cells. Histopathologically, we confirm that the PC is the 
      main target of SCA31 pathogenesis. We find that the RNA foci containing (UGGAA)n 
      are indeed observed in PC nuclei of both SCA31 patients, whereas similar foci 
      were not observed in control individuals. In both transiently and stably 
      expressed cultured cell models, we also find that the mutation transcribed in the 
      BEAN1-direction yields more toxicity than control transcripts and forms RNA foci 
      detected with probes against (UGGAA)n and (UAGAAUAAAA)n . Taking these findings 
      together, we conclude that the RNA foci containing BEAN1-direction transcript 
      (UGGAA)n are associated with PC degeneration in SCA31.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias are a group of rare and heterogeneous autosomal dominant 
      disorders characterized by progressive ataxia and other features. Spinocerebellar 
      ataxia 17 (SCA17) is one of the 32 subtypes described to date and is secondary to 
      CAG/CAA repeat expansion in the gene coding for the TATA-box binding protein 
      (TBP). SCA17 is clinically heterogeneous and typically presents with slowly 
      evolving ataxia, dysarthria, dementia, depression, and other movement disorders 
      such as chorea. More than 41 CAG/CAA repeats are considered diagnostic of SCA17, 
      with more than 49 being associated with full penetrance. We report one patient 
      presenting with isolated rapidly evolving ataxia who was found to have 44 CAG/CAA 
      repeats in the TBP gene. This suggests that, while SCA17 typically slowly 
      progresses over years, its repertoire of presentations should be expanded to 
      include rapidly progressive isolated ataxia resembling paraneoplastic disorders 
      or prion disease.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) also known as Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD), 
      is one of nine polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases caused by a CAG-trinucelotide 
      repeat expansion within the coding sequence of the ATXN3 gene. There are no 
      disease-modifying treatments for polyQ diseases. Recent studies suggest that an 
      imbalance in histone acetylation may be a key process leading to transcriptional 
      dysregulation in polyQ diseases. Because of this possible imbalance, the 
      application of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors may be feasible for the 
      treatment of polyQ diseases. To further explore the therapeutic potential of HDAC 
      inhibitors, we constructed two independent preclinical trials with valproic acid 
      (VPA), a promising therapeutic HDAC inhibitor, in both Drosophila and cell SCA3 
      models. We demonstrated that prolonged use of VPA at specific dose partly 
      prevented eye depigmentation, alleviated climbing disability, and extended the 
      average lifespan of SCA3/MJD transgenic Drosophila. We found that VPA could both 
      increase the acetylation levels of histone H3 and histone H4 and reduce the early 
      apoptotic rate of cells without inhibiting the aggregation of mutant ataxin-3 
      proteins in MJDtr-Q68- expressing cells. These results collectively support the 
      premise that VPA is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of SCA3 and 
      other polyQ diseases.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by polyglutamine repeat expansions in Ataxin-1. Recent evidence 
      supports a role for microRNAs (miRNAs) deregulation in SCA1 pathogenesis. 
      However, the extent to which miRNAs may modulate the onset, progression or 
      severity of SCA1 remains largely unknown. In this study, we used a mouse model of 
      SCA1 to determine if miRNAs are misregulated in pre- and post-symptomatic SCA1 
      cerebellum. We found a significant alteration in the steady-state levels of 
      numerous miRNAs prior to and following phenotypic onset. In addition, we provide 
      evidence that increased miR-150 levels in SCA1 Purkinje neurons may modulate 
      disease pathogenesis by targeting the expression of Rgs8 and Vegfa.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. CAG (cytosine-adenine-guanine) trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 
      causative genes have been identified as the cause of different SCA. In this 
      study, we simultaneously genotyped SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 applying a 
      fluorescent multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay. We analyzed 10 families 
      with SCA (64 patients) from five different communities of Veracruz, a Mexican 
      southeastern state, and identified 55 patients for SCA7 and 9 for SCA2, but none 
      for SCA1, SCA3, or SCA6. To our knowledge, this sample represents one of the 
      largest series of SCA7 cases reported worldwide. Genotyping of 300 healthy 
      individuals from Mexican population and compiled data from different ethnicities 
      showed discordant results concerning the hypothesis that SCA disease alleles 
      arise by expansion of large normal alleles.

TI  - Reduction of mutant ataxin-7 expression restores motor function and prevents 
      cerebellar synaptic reorganization in a conditional mouse model of SCA7.
PG  - 890-903
LID - 10.1093/hmg/dds495 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CAG - polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the ataxin-7 
      gene. In polyQ disorders, synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration may develop 
      prior to symptom onset. However, conditional expression studies of polyQ disease 
      models demonstrate that suppression of gene expression can yield complete 
      reversal of established behavioral abnormalities. To determine if SCA7 
      neurological and neurodegenerative phenotypes are reversible, we crossed 
      PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q BAC transgenic mice with a tamoxifen-inducible Cre 
      recombinase transgenic line, CAGGS-Cre-ER. PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q BAC;CAGGS-Cre-ER 
      bigenic mice were treated with a single dose of tamoxifen 1 month after the onset 
      of detectable ataxia, which resulted in ~50% reduction of polyQ-ataxin-7 
      expression. Tamoxifen treatment halted or reversed SCA7 motor symptoms, reduced 
      ataxin-7 aggregation in Purkinje cells (PCs), and prevented loss of climbing 
      fiber (CF)-PC synapses in comparison to vehicle-treated bigenic animals and 
      tamoxifen-treated PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q BAC single transgenic mice. Despite this 
      phenotype rescue, reduced ataxin-7 expression did not result in full recovery of 
      cerebellar molecular layer thickness or prevent Bergmann glia degeneration. These 
      results demonstrate that suppression of mutant gene expression by only 50% in a 
      polyQ disease model can have a significant impact on disease phenotypes, even 
      when initiated after the onset of detectable behavioral deficits. The findings 
      reported here are consistent with the emerging view that therapies aimed at 
      reducing neurotoxic gene expression hold the potential to halt or reverse disease 
      progression in afflicted patients, even after the onset of neurological 
      disability.

AB  - We present a unique thirty-nine year old woman with both Huntington's disease 
      (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10). She has 48 CAG repeats in the HD 
      gene and 2511 ATTCT repeats in the ATX10 gene. Although both conditions are 
      repeat expansion diseases they are thought to have quite different pathogenic 
      mechanisms. The symptomatic age of onset in this patient (mid30s) is within the 
      expected range for her repeat expansion sizes for each condition, but we discuss 
      the evidence that the two conditions may interact to produce a more severe 
      cognitive phenotype than would be expected for either of the conditions 
      independently. The subject has Amerindian background on the maternal side from 
      Colombia, South America, thus adding a 5th country expressing SCA10, all with 
      Amerindian ancestry.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7: report of a new Italian family.
PG  - 2953-5
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by degeneration of the cerebellum, brainstem and retina. We herein 
      describe a family from southern Italy whose proband was a 49-year-old man 
      presenting with ataxia with progressive gait disturbances, clumsiness and visual 
      impairment. A molecular analysis identified 38 cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) 
      repeat expansions within the SCA7 gene. Our study confirms the marked 
      anticipation previously observed in SCA7 and extends the small number of patients 
      studied thus far. In this family, the disease is most likely caused by a de novo 
      expansion of a premutated intermediate allele carried by one parent.

PG  - 626-9
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2012.231 [doi]
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a genetically and clinically heterogeneous 
      group of diseases, characterized by dominant inheritance, progressive cerebellar 
      ataxia and diverse extracerebellar symptoms. A subgroup of the ataxias is caused 
      by unstable CAG-repeat expansions in their respective genes leading to pathogenic 
      expansions of polyglutamine stretches in the encoded proteins. In general, 
      unstable CAG repeats have an uninterrupted CAG repeat, whereas stable CAG repeats 
      are either short or interrupted by CAA codons, which - like CAG codons - code for 
      glutamine. Here we report on an infantile SCA2 patient who, due to germ-line CAG 
      repeat instability in her father, inherited an extremely expanded CAG repeat in 
      the SCA2 locus. Surprisingly, the expanded allele of the father was an 
      interrupted CAG repeat sequence. Furthermore, analyses of single spermatozoa 
      showed a high frequency of paternal germ-line repeat sequence instability of the 
      expanded SCA2 locus.

AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) encompass a heterogeneous group of 
      rare diseases that affect the cerebellum and its connections. The most common 
      forms have been associated with dynamic mutations while some rarer forms with 
      conventional mutations. Studies in different populations revealed differences in 
      their relative frequencies both within and between the studied populations, 
      showing that the frequencies are depended on ethnic and geographical factors. 
      Previous investigation of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in the Cypriot population, revealed no 
      pathogenic expansion in the Cypriot SCA patients. We hereby present our recent 
      investigation of the SCA10 pentanucleotide repeat expansion. Forty-two 
      ascertained Cypriot sporadic ataxia patients, the index case from 1 ADCA and 14 
      ARCA families and a cohort of normal population individuals were included in the 
      study. All our patients have normal range ATXN10 gene ATTCT repeat numbers 
      (10-19). In the normal population group, repeat lengths ranged from 11 to 20 with 
      the 14 repeats allele being the most frequent. Therefore, all currently 
      established dynamic repeat SCA mutations are absent from the Cypriot population, 
      indicating distinct genetic causes.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 is a neurodegenerative polyglutamine disease 
      characterized by ataxia and retinal degeneration. The longitudinal course is 
      unknown, and relationships between repeat expansion, clinical manifestations, and 
      neuropathology remain uncertain. We followed 16 affected individuals of a 
      61-member kindred over 27 years with electroretinograms, neurological 
      examinations including the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale, neuroimaging in five, and 
      autopsy in four cases. We identified four stages of the illness: Stage 0, 
      gene-positive but phenotypically silent; Stage 1, no symptoms, but hyperreflexia 
      and/or abnormal electroretinograms; Stage 2, symptoms and signs progress 
      modestly; and Stage 3, rapid clinical progression. CAG repeat length correlated 
      inversely with age of onset of visual or motor signs (r = -0.74, p = 0.002). 
      Stage 3 rate of progression did not differ between cases (p = 0.18). 
      Electroretinograms correlated with Brief Ataxia Rating Scale score and were a 
      biomarker of disease onset and progression. All symptomatic patients developed 
      gait ataxia, extremity dysmetria, dysarthria, dysrhythmia, and oculomotor 
      abnormalities. Funduscopy revealed pale optic discs and pigmentary disturbances. 
      Visual acuity declined to blindness in those with longer CAG expansions. 
      Hyperreflexia was present from Stage 1 onwards. Restless legs syndrome and 
      sensory impairment were common. Neuropathological hallmarks were neuronal loss in 
      cerebellar cortex, deep cerebellar nuclei, inferior olive, and anterior horns of 
      the spinal cord, and axonal loss in spinocerebellar tracts, dorsal nerve roots, 
      and posterior columns. Retinal pathology included photoreceptor degeneration and 
      disruption of retinal pigment epithelium. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 evolves 
      through four clinical stages; neuropathological findings underlie the clinical 
      presentation; electroretinograms are a potential biomarker of disease 
      progression.

TI  - Severe and rapidly progressing cognitive phenotype in a SCA17-family with only 
      marginally expanded CAG/CAA repeats in the TATA-box binding protein gene: a case 
      report.
PG  - 73
LID - 10.1186/1471-2377-12-73 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) confine a group 
      of rare and heterogeneous disorders, which present with progressive ataxia and 
      numerous other features e.g. peripheral neuropathy, macular degeneration and 
      cognitive impairment, and a subset of these disorders is caused by CAG-repeat 
      expansions in their respective genes. The diagnosing of the SCAs is often 
      difficult due to the phenotypic overlap among several of the subtypes and with 
      other neurodegenerative disorders e.g. Huntington's disease. CASE PRESENTATION: 
      We report a family in which the proband had rapidly progressing cognitive decline 
      and only subtle cerebellar symptoms from age 42. Sequencing of the TATA-box 
      binding protein gene revealed a modest elongation of the CAG/CAA-repeat of only 
      two repeats above the non-pathogenic threshold of 41, confirming a diagnosis of 
      SCA17. Normally, repeats within this range show reduced penetrance and result in 
      a milder disease course with slower progression and later age of onset. Thus, 
      this case presented with an unusual phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The current case 
      highlights the diagnostic challenge of neurodegenerative disorders and the need 
      for a thorough clinical and paraclinical examination of patients presenting with 
      rapid cognitive decline to make a precise diagnosis on which further genetic 
      counseling and initiation of treatment modalities can be based.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease that results from a pathogenic glutamine-repeat expansion in the protein 
      ataxin-1 (ATXN1). Although the functions of ATXN1 are still largely unknown, 
      there is evidence to suggest that ATXN1 plays a role in regulating gene 
      expression, the earliest process known to go awry in SCA1 mouse models. In this 
      study, we show that ATXN1 reduces histone acetylation, a post-translational 
      modification of histones associated with enhanced transcription, and represses 
      histone acetyl transferase-mediated transcription. In addition, we find that 
      depleting the Leucine-rich Acidic Nuclear Protein (LANP)-an ATXN1 binding 
      inhibitor of histone acetylation-reverses aspects of SCA1 neuritic pathology.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias: an example of the challenges associated with genetic 
      databases for dynamic mutations.
PG  - 1359-65
LID - 10.1002/humu.22156 [doi]
AB  - Locus-specific databases are an important source of information for diagnostic 
      laboratories and a valued means of improving quality of genetic testing. Although 
      increasingly frequent, databases for oligonucleotide repeat expansions are still 
      scarce, due to factors that make them different and the building of databases 
      much more difficult. Definition of what constitutes "the repeat" to measure is 
      not a simple matter and correct sizing is not always straightforward. Reference 
      ranges and penetrance classes are not easy to establish. Acceptable margins of 
      error depend on the disease and allele-size distribution, and vary according to 
      size range and pathogenic significance. Inter- and intralaboratorial variance is 
      well documented and allele distribution may vary among populations. The 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, used only as an example of those difficulties, are also 
      a highly heterogeneous group, which includes loci with both pathogenic repeat 
      expansions and point mutations or insertions/deletions. They display a variable, 
      but often overlapping phenotype, where genotype-phenotype correlation is 
      difficult or nonexistent. Standard (Human Genome Variation Society) nomenclature 
      is not appropriate for oligonucleotide repeats, as established at harmonization 
      among all EMQN (European Molecular Genetics Network) external quality assessment 
      (EQA) schemes for "repeat disorders." Curation of such databases is a difficult 
      task, but one that needs to be addressed adequately and without much delay.

TI  - Clinical features of SCA36: a novel spinocerebellar ataxia with motor neuron

PG  - 333-41
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0b013e318260436f [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the phenotype of spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 
      (SCA36), a novel dominant disorder (nicknamed "Asidan") caused by a 
      hexanucleotide GGCCTG repeat expansion in intron 1 of the NOP56 gene. METHODS: We 
      investigated the clinical, genetic, and neuropathologic characteristics of 18 
      patients with SCA36. We performed histologic evaluation of a muscle biopsy 
      specimen from 1 patient with SCA36, and neuropathologic evaluation of an 
      autopsied brain from another patient with SCA36. RESULTS: The (GGCCTG)n expansion 
      was found in 18 ataxic patients from 9 families. The age at onset of ataxia was 
      53.1 +/- 3.4 years, with the most frequent symptoms being truncal ataxia (100% of 
      patients), ataxic dysarthria (100%), limb ataxia (93%), and hyperreflexia (79%). 
      Tongue fasciculation and subsequent atrophy were found in 71% of cases, 
      particularly in those of long duration. Skeletal muscle fasciculation and atrophy 
      of the limbs and trunk were found in 57% of cases. Lower motor involvement was 
      confirmed by EMG and muscle biopsy. The neuropathologic study revealed 
      significant cerebellar Purkinje cell degeneration with obvious loss of lower 
      motor neurons. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that NOP56 was localized to 
      the nuclei of various neurons. Cytoplasmic or intranuclear inclusion staining of 
      NOP56, TDP-43, and ataxin-2 was not observed in the remaining neurons. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of the unique clinical features of 
      SCA36, a relatively pure cerebellar ataxia with progressive motor neuron 
      involvement. Thus, SCA36 is a disease that stands at the crossroads of SCA and 
      motor neuron disease.

      for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.
PG  - 74-82

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias are autosomal dominant diseases, associated in some types 
      with a CAG repeat expansion, and characterised by a progressive loss of motor 
      function. Currently, as there is no cure for most ataxias, treatment 
      predominantly involves physical therapy. Various symptomatic drug treatments have 
      been tried; however, published clinical studies have provided inconsistent 
      results, likely due to small sample sizes, mixed patient populations and 
      insensitive or subjective assessment scales. SCA1(154Q) transgenic mice display 
      motor function impairments and ultimately a reduced number of cerebellar Purkinje 
      neurons-characteristics comparable to most forms of sporadic and hereditary 
      ataxias. We monitored motor function in SCA1(154Q) mice from 5 to 20 weeks of age 
      and assessed the efficacy of four potential cerebellar modulatory drugs in 
      attenuating deficits in rotor-rod performance. The drugs riluzole, amantadine, 
      zolpidem and buspirone were selected based on their different mechanisms of 
      action and their Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/Australian Therapeutic Goods 
      Administration approval for other indications. SCA1(154Q) and C57/Bl6 wild-type 
      mice were administered with four ascending acute doses of each drug, over 2 days. 
      Following each dose, mice were assesed for motor function on the accelerating 
      rotor-rod. None of the four drugs attenuated motor deficts in SCA1(154Q) mice at 
      any dose; at FDA equivalent and higher dose administration of zolpidem and 
      buspirone led to sedation in both strains. Our results suggest that the 
      aforementioned drugs are likely to be ineffective for symptomatic treatment of 
      SCA1 and most other ataxic patients and emphasise the need for comphrehensive 
      drug studies prior to clinical use.

      patients with cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 178-80
LID - 10.1016/j.jns.2012.03.019 [doi]
AB  - The relative frequency of different autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, 
      commonly referred to as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), varies considerably among 
      populations of different ethnic origin. No data exist at present on the frequency 
      of different SCAs in the Greek population. In the present study we investigated 
      the presence of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in a cohort of 83 Greek patients with slowly 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia. Twenty patients came from autosomal dominant (AD) 
      pedigrees, seven displayed recessive or unclear inheritance and 56 were sporadic. 
      We found four patients with pathological SCA expansions, all from AD pedigrees. 
      Two patients had SCA1, one SCA2 and one SCA7 (10.0, 5.0 and 5.0% of the AD group, 
      respectively). The clinical features of these patients were within the expected 
      spectrum. In total, a pathological expansion was detected in 20% of patients from 
      AD pedigrees. Interestingly, no cases of SCA3 or SCA6 were detected in the AD 
      group. No expansions were found in other familial cases or in sporadic patients. 
      Overall, no cases of SCA3, SCA6, SCA12, SCA17 or DRPLA were identified in the 
      Greek population. In conclusion, SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 are present in Greek 
      patients with AD cerebellar ataxia in frequencies similar to those observed in 
      other populations. SCA3 and SCA6 appear however to be rare in Greece. The genetic 
      cause for the majority of AD ataxias remains to be identified.

TI  - 'Costa da Morte' ataxia is spinocerebellar ataxia 36: clinical and genetic 
      characterization.
PG  - 1423-35
LID - 10.1093/brain/aws069 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 36 has been recently described in Japanese families as a 
      new type of spinocerebellar ataxia with motor neuron signs. It is caused by a 
      GGCCTG repeat expansion in intron 1 of NOP56. Family interview and document 
      research allowed us to reconstruct two extensive, multigenerational kindreds 
      stemming from the same village (Costa da Morte in Galicia, Spain), in the 17th 
      century. We found the presence of the spinocerebellar ataxia 36 mutation 
      co-segregating with disease in these families in whom we had previously 
      identified an ~0.8 Mb linkage region to chromosome 20 p. Subsequent screening 
      revealed the NOP56 expansion in eight additional Galician ataxia kindreds. While 
      normal alleles contain 5-14 hexanucleotide repeats, expanded alleles range from 
      ~650 to 2500 repeats, within a shared haplotype. Further expansion of repeat size 
      was frequent, especially upon paternal transmission, while instances of allele 
      contraction were observed in maternal transmissions. We found a total of 63 
      individuals carrying the mutation, 44 of whom were confirmed to be clinically 
      affected; over 400 people are at risk. We describe here the detailed clinical 
      picture, consisting of a late-onset, slowly progressive cerebellar syndrome with 
      variable eye movement abnormalities and sensorineural hearing loss. There were 
      signs of denervation in the tongue, as well as mild pyramidal signs, but 
      otherwise no signs of classical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Magnetic resonance 
      imaging findings were consistent with the clinical course, showing atrophy of the 
      cerebellar vermis in initial stages, later evolving to a pattern of 
      olivo-ponto-cerebellar atrophy. We estimated the origin of the founder mutation 
      in Galicia to have occurred ~1275 years ago. Out of 160 Galician families with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia, 10 (6.3%) were found to have spinocerebellar ataxia 36, 
      while 15 (9.4%) showed other of the routinely tested dominant spinocerebellar 
      ataxia types. Spinocerebellar ataxia 36 is thus, so far, the most frequent 
      dominant spinocerebellar ataxia in this region, which may have implications for 
      American countries associated with traditional Spanish emigration.

TI  - An evaluation of oligonucleotide-based therapeutic strategies for polyQ diseases.
PG  - 6
LID - 10.1186/1471-2199-13-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: RNA interference (RNAi) and antisense strategies provide experimental 
      therapeutic agents for numerous diseases, including polyglutamine (polyQ) 
      disorders caused by CAG repeat expansion. We compared the potential of different 
      oligonucleotide-based strategies for silencing the genes responsible for several 
      polyQ diseases, including Huntington's disease and two spinocerebellar ataxias, 
      type 1 and type 3. The strategies included nonallele-selective gene silencing, 
      gene replacement, allele-selective SNP targeting and CAG repeat targeting. 
      RESULTS: Using the patient-derived cell culture models of polyQ diseases, we 
      tested various siRNAs, and antisense reagents and assessed their silencing 
      efficiency and allele selectivity. We showed considerable allele discrimination 
      by several SNP targeting siRNAs based on a weak G-G or G-U pairing with normal 
      allele and strong G-C pairing with mutant allele at the site of RISC-induced 
      cleavage. Among the CAG repeat targeting reagents the strongest allele 
      discrimination is achieved by miRNA-like functioning reagents that bind to their 
      targets and inhibit their translation without substantial target cleavage. Also, 
      morpholino analog performs well in mutant and normal allele discrimination but 
      its efficient delivery to cells at low effective concentration still remains a 
      challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Using three cellular models of polyQ diseases and the 
      same experimental setup we directly compared the performance of different 
      oligonucleotide-based treatment strategies that are currently under development. 
      Based on the results obtained by us and others we discussed the advantages and 
      drawbacks of these strategies considering them from several different 
      perspectives. The strategy aimed at nonallele-selective inhibiting of causative 
      gene expression by targeting specific sequence of the implicated gene is the 
      easiest to implement but relevant benefits are still uncertain. The gene 
      replacement strategy that combines the nonallele-selective gene silencing with 
      the expression of the exogenous normal allele is a logical extension of the 
      former and it deserves to be explored further. Both allele-selective RNAi 
      approaches challenge cellular RNA interference machinery to show its ability to 
      discriminate between similar sequences differing in either single base 
      substitutions or repeated sequence length. Although both approaches perform well 
      in allele discrimination most of our efforts are focused on repeat targeting due 
      to its potentially higher universality.

TI  - Mutational origin of Machado-Joseph disease in the Australian Aboriginal 
      communities of Groote Eylandt and Yirrkala.
PG  - 746-51
LID - 10.1001/archneurol.2011.2504 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the presence of Machado-Joseph disease (MJD, also 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 [SCA3]) among Australian aborigines was caused by a 
      new mutational event or by the introduction of expanded alleles from other 
      populations. DESIGN: We sequenced a region of 4 kilobases (kb), encompassing the 
      CAG repeat within the ATXN3 gene, in 2 affected Australian aboriginal families 
      and compared them with the Joseph and Machado lineages described before. 
      Full-extended haplotypes (including also more distant single-nucleotide 
      polymorphisms and flanking short tandem repeats) were assessed by segregation and 
      allele-specific amplification. A phylogenetic tree was inferred from genetic 
      distances, and age of the Australasian Joseph-derived lineage was estimated. 
      SETTING: The aboriginal communities of Groote Eylandt and Yirrkala, in the 
      Northern Territories, Australia (local ethics institutional permission was 
      granted, and both community and individual informed consent was obtained). 
      SUBJECTS: A convenience sample of 19 patients and unaffected relatives, from 2 
      Australian aboriginal families affected with MJD; 40 families with MJD of 
      multiethnic origins and 50 unrelated Asian control subjects. RESULTS: The 2 
      aboriginal families shared the same full haplotype, including 20 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms:TTGATCGAGC-(CAG)(Exp)-CACCCAGCGC, that is, the 
      Joseph lineage with a G variant in rs56268847.Among 33 families with the Joseph 
      lineage, this derived haplotype was found only in 5 of 16 Taiwanese, all 3 
      Indian,and 1 of 3 Japanese families analyzed. CONCLUSION: A related-extended MJD 
      haplotype shared by Australian aborigines and some Asian families (a 
      Joseph-derived lineage) suggests a common ancestor for all, dating back more than 
      7000 years.

TI  - Prevalence of inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate receptor type 1 gene deletion, the 
      mutation for spinocerebellar ataxia type 15, in Japan screened by gene dosage.
PG  - 202-6
LID - 10.1038/jhg.2012.5 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 15 (SCA15) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder clinically characterized by late-onset, slowly progressive pure 
      cerebellar ataxia. This disease is caused by a heterozygous deletion of the 
      inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate receptor type 1 (ITPR1) gene, suggesting that 
      haploinsufficiency of the receptor function is the plausible disease mechanism. 
      To clarify the prevalence of SCA15 in Japan, we designed four sets of probes and 
      primers in different regions of ITPR1 and performed TaqMan PCR assay to search 
      for gene deletions in 226 index SCA patients excluded for repeat expansion 
      disorders. Deletion was found in only one patient, in whom gait ataxia started at 
      51 years of age and progressed to show cerebellar ataxia. This study demonstrates 
      a simple but efficient method for screening ITPR1 deletion. We also conclude that 
      ITPR1 gene deletions are much rare in Japan than in Europe, comprising only 0.3% 
      in all SCAs in Japan.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 cerebellar disease requires the coordinated action 
      of mutant ataxin-7 in neurons and glia, and displays non-cell-autonomous bergmann 
      glia degeneration.
PG  - 16269-78
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4000-11.2011 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a dominantly inherited disorder 
      characterized by cerebellum and brainstem neurodegeneration. SCA7 is caused by a 
      CAG/polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the ataxin-7 gene. We previously 
      reported that directed expression of polyQ-ataxin-7 in Bergmann glia (BG) in 
      transgenic mice leads to ataxia and non-cell-autonomous Purkinje cell (PC) 
      degeneration. To further define the cellular basis of SCA7, we derived a 
      conditional inactivation mouse model by inserting a loxP-flanked ataxin-7 cDNA 
      with 92 repeats into the translational start site of the murine prion protein 
      (PrP) gene in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). The PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q 
      BAC mice developed neurological disease, and exhibited cerebellar degeneration 
      and BG process loss. To inactivate polyQ-ataxin-7 expression in specific 
      cerebellar cell types, we crossed PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q BAC mice with Gfa2-Cre 
      transgenic mice (to direct Cre to BG) or Pcp2-Cre transgenic mice (which yields 
      Cre in PCs and inferior olive). Excision of ataxin-7 from BG partially rescued 
      the behavioral phenotype, but did not prevent BG process loss or molecular layer 
      thinning, while excision of ataxin-7 from PCs and inferior olive provided 
      significantly greater rescue and prevented both pathological changes, revealing a 
      non-cell-autonomous basis for BG pathology. When we prevented expression of 
      mutant ataxin-7 in BG, PCs, and inferior olive by deriving 
      Gfa2-Cre;Pcp2-Cre;PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q BAC triple transgenic mice, we noted a 
      dramatic improvement in SCA7 disease phenotypes. These findings indicate that 
      SCA7 disease pathogenesis involves a convergence of alterations in a variety of 
      different cell types to fully recapitulate the cerebellar degeneration.

TI  - Detection of large expansions in SCA8 using a fluorescent repeat-primed PCR 
      assay.
PG  - 63-6
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia. It is caused by 
      bidirectional expression of (CUG)n expansion in the ATXN80S/ATXN8 gene and (CAG)n 
      expansion transcripts in ATXN8. The diagnosis of SCA8 must be confirmed by the 
      presence of a (CTG)n trinucleotide repeat expansion in the ATXN8OS gene. On the 
      other hand, there are many human genetic diseases that are caused by expansion of 
      short tandem repeats. Since Werner et al proposed a repeat-primed fluorescent PCR 
      to detect large CTG-repeats in myotonic dystrophy, Friedreich ataxia, SCA2, SCA7, 
      SCA10 and SCA12 have been reported. In this study, we applied a fluorescent PCR 
      method for detection of expanded repeats in the ATXN8OS/ATXN8 gene. Although this 
      test cannot give a precise estimate of the size of the expansion, it proved 
      useful for confirming the presence of expansions in SCA8.

TI  - Parkinsonian phenotype in Machado-Joseph disease (MJD/SCA3): a two-case report.
PG  - 131
LID - 10.1186/1471-2377-11-131 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), or spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 
      (SCA3), is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder of late onset, which 
      is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of the ATXN3 gene. This 
      disease presents clinical heterogeneity, which cannot be completely explained by 
      the size of the repeat tract. MJD presents extrapyramidal motor signs, namely 
      parkinsonism, more frequently than the other subtypes of autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxias. Although parkinsonism seems to segregate within MJD families, 
      only a few MJD patients develop parkinsonian features and, therefore, the 
      clinical and genetic aspects of these rare presentations remain poorly 
      investigated. The main goal of this work was to describe two MJD patients 
      displaying the parkinsonian triad (tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity), namely on 
      what concerns genetic variation in Parkinson's disease (PD) associated loci 
      (PARK2, LRRK2, PINK1, DJ-1, SNCA, MAPT, APOE, and mtDNA tRNA(Gln) T4336C). CASE 
      PRESENTATION: Patient 1 is a 40 year-old female (onset at 30 years of age), 
      initially with a pure parkinsonian phenotype (similar to the phenotype previously 
      reported for her mother). Patient 2 is a 38 year-old male (onset at 33 years of 
      age), presenting an ataxic phenotype with parkinsonian features (not seen either 
      in other affected siblings or in his father). Both patients presented an expanded 
      ATXN3 allele with 72 CAG repeats. No PD mutations were found in the analyzed 
      loci. However, allelic variants previously associated with PD were observed in 
      DJ-1 and APOE genes, for both patients. CONCLUSIONS: The present report adds 
      clinical and genetic information on this particular and rare MJD presentation, 
      and raises the hypothesis that DJ-1 and APOE polymorphisms may confer 
      susceptibility to the parkinsonian phenotype in MJD.

AB  - To date there are 9 known diseases caused by an expanded polyglutamine repeat, 
      with the most prevalent being Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease is a 
      progressive autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder for which currently no 
      therapy is available. It is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene, 
      which results in an expansion of a glutamine stretch at the N-terminal end of the 
      huntingtin protein. This polyglutamine expansion plays a central role in the 
      disease and results in the accumulation of cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates. 
      Here, we make use of modified 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate (CUG)n triplet-repeat 
      antisense oligonucleotides to effectively reduce mutant huntingtin transcript and 
      protein levels in patient-derived Huntington's disease fibroblasts and 
      lymphoblasts. The most effective antisense oligonucleotide, (CUG)(7), also 
      reduced mutant ataxin-1 and ataxin-3 mRNA levels in spinocerebellar ataxia 1 and 
      3, respectively, and atrophin-1 in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy patient 
      derived fibroblasts. This antisense oligonucleotide is not only a promising 
      therapeutic tool to reduce mutant huntingtin levels in Huntington's disease but 
      our results in spinocerebellar ataxia and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      cells suggest that this could also be applicable to other polyglutamine expansion 
      disorders as well.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansions in the ataxin-7 gene. Ataxin-7 is a component 
      of two different transcription coactivator complexes, and recent work indicates 
      that disease protein normal function is altered in polyglutamine 
      neurodegeneration. Given this, we studied how ataxin-7 gene expression is 
      regulated. The ataxin-7 repeat and translation start site are flanked by binding 
      sites for CTCF, a highly conserved multifunctional transcription regulator. When 
      we analyzed this region, we discovered an adjacent alternative promoter and a 
      convergently transcribed antisense noncoding RNA, SCAANT1. To understand how CTCF 
      regulates ataxin-7 gene expression, we introduced ataxin-7 mini-genes into mice, 
      and found that CTCF is required for SCAANT1 expression. Loss of SCAANT1 
      derepressed ataxin-7 sense transcription in a cis-dependent fashion and was 
      accompanied by chromatin remodeling. Discovery of this pathway underscores the 
      importance of altered epigenetic regulation for disease pathology at repeat loci 
      exhibiting bidirectional transcription.

TI  - Expansion of intronic GGCCTG hexanucleotide repeat in NOP56 causes SCA36, a type 
      of spinocerebellar ataxia accompanied by motor neuron involvement.
PG  - 121-30
LID - 10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.05.015 [doi]
AB  - Autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we performed genetic analysis of a 
      unique form of SCA (SCA36) that is accompanied by motor neuron involvement. 
      Genome-wide linkage analysis and subsequent fine mapping for three unrelated 
      Japanese families in a cohort of SCA cases, in whom molecular diagnosis had never 
      been performed, mapped the disease locus to the region of a 1.8 Mb stretch (LOD 
      score of 4.60) on 20p13 (D20S906-D20S193) harboring 37 genes with definitive open 
      reading frames. We sequenced 33 of these and observed a large expansion of an 
      intronic GGCCTG hexanucleotide repeat in NOP56 and an unregistered missense 
      variant (Phe265Leu) in C20orf194, but we found no mutations in PDYN and TGM6. The 
      expansion showed complete segregation with the SCA phenotype in family studies, 
      whereas Phe265Leu in C20orf194 did not. Screening of the expansions in the SCA 
      cohort cases revealed four additional occurrences, but none were revealed in the 
      cohort of 27 Alzheimer disease cases, 154 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases, or 
      300 controls. In total, nine unrelated cases were found in 251 cohort SCA 
      patients (3.6%). A founder haplotype was confirmed in these cases. RNA foci 
      formation was detected in lymphoblastoid cells from affected subjects by 
      fluorescence in situ hybridization. Double staining and gel-shift assay showed 
      that (GGCCUG)n binds the RNA-binding protein SRSF2 but that (CUG)(6) does not. In 
      addition, transcription of MIR1292, a neighboring miRNA, was significantly 
      decreased in lymphoblastoid cells of SCA patients. Our finding suggests that 
      SCA36 is caused by hexanucleotide repeat expansions through RNA gain of function.

TI  - Brain stem and cerebellum volumetric analysis of Machado Joseph disease patients.
PG  - 292-6
LID - S0004-282X2011000300005 [pii]
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease, or spinocerebellar ataxia type 3(MJD/SCA3), is the most 
      frequent late onset spinocerebellar ataxia and results from a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the ataxin-3 gene. Previous studies have found correlation between 
      atrophy of cerebellum and brainstem with age and CAG repeats, although no such 
      correlation has been found with disease duration and clinical manifestations. In 
      this study we test the hypothesis that atrophy of cerebellum and brainstem in 
      MJD/SCA3 is related to clinical severity, disease duration and CAG repeat length 
      as well as to other variables such as age and ICARS (International Cooperative 
      Ataxia Rating Scale). Whole brain high resolution MRI and volumetric measurement 
      with cranial volume normalization were obtained from 15 MJD/SCA3 patients and 15 
      normal, age and sex-matchedcontrols. We applied ICARS and compared the score with 
      volumes and CAG number, disease duration and age. We found significant 
      correlation of both brain stem and cerebellar atrophy with CAG repeat length, 
      age, disease duration and degree of disability. The Spearman rank correlation was 
      stronger with volumetric reduction of the cerebellum than with brain stem. Our 
      data allow us to conclude that volumetric analysis might reveal progressive 
      degeneration after disease onset, which in turn is linked to both age and number 
      of CAG repeat expansions in SCA 3.

      lateral sclerosis.
PG  - 2062-5
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0b013e31821f4447 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Given the recent finding of an association between intermediate-length 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) expansions in ataxin 2 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (ALS), we sought to determine whether expansions in other polyQ disease genes 
      were associated with ALS. METHODS: We assessed the polyQ lengths of ataxin 1, 
      ataxin 3, ataxin 6, ataxin 7, TBP, atrophin 1, and huntingtin in several hundred 
      patients with sporadic ALS and healthy controls. RESULTS: Other than ataxin 2, we 
      did not identify a significant association with the other polyQ genes and ALS. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the effects of ataxin 2 polyQ expansions on 
      ALS risk are likely to be rooted in the biology of ataxin 2 or ataxin 2-specific 
      interactions, rather than the presence of an expanded polyQ repeat per se. These 
      findings have important consequences for understanding the role of ataxin 2 in 
      ALS pathogenesis and provide a framework for future mechanistic studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      of motor neurons that results in progressive muscle weakness and limits survival 
      to 2-5 years after disease onset. Intermediate CAG repeat expansions in ataxin 2 
      (ATXN2), the causative gene of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), have been 
      implicated in sporadic ALS. We studied ATXN2 in a large cohort of patients with 
      sporadic and familial ALS. METHODS: We determined ATXN2 CAG repeat size in 1,948 
      sporadic and familial ALS cases and 2,002 controls from Belgium and the 
      Netherlands. RESULTS: In controls, the maximal ATXN2 repeat size was 31. In 
      sporadic ALS, a significant amount of longer repeat sizes (>/= 32, range 32-39) 
      were encountered (in 0.5% or 10/1,845 ALS cases, vs 0% in controls, p = 0.0006). 
      Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that a cutoff of >/= 29 appeared 
      optimal to discriminate ALS from control (p = 0.036, odds ratio [OR] 1.92, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 1.04-3.64). A meta-analysis with the previously 
      published results from the United States showed that the association between a 
      repeat length of >/= 29 and ALS became stronger (p < 0.0001, OR 2.93, 95% CI 
      1.73-4.98). In unexplained familial ALS, we found an intermediate repeat 
      expansion of 31 and a homozygous repeat expansion of 33 each in 1.1% of families. 
      The phenotype of patients with ALS with expanded repeat sizes ranged from rapidly 
      progressive typical ALS to slowly progressive ALS with reduced sensory nerve 
      action potentials. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal a novel genetic overlap between 
      ALS and SCA2.

TI  - SCA15 due to large ITPR1 deletions in a cohort of 333 white families with 
      dominant ataxia.
PG  - 637-43
LID - 10.1001/archneurol.2011.81 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deletions in ITPR1, coding for the inositol-triphosphate receptor 
      type 1, have been recently identified in spinocerebellar ataxia type 15 (SCA15). 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and the phenotypical spectrum of SCA15. 
      DESIGN: Taqman polymerase chain reaction (258 index cases) or single-nucleotide 
      polymorphism genome-wide genotyping (75 index cases). SETTING: A collaboration 
      between the Centre de Recherche de l'Institut de Cerveau et de la Moelle Epiniere 
      of the Salpetriere Hospital (Paris, France) and the Molecular Genetics Unit of 
      the National Institute of Aging (Bethesda, Maryland). Patients  Index cases of 
      333 families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia negative for CAG repeat 
      expansions in coding exons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection of ITPR1 copy number 
      alterations. RESULTS: A deletion of ITPR1 was found in 6 of 333 families (1.8%), 
      corresponding to 13 patients with SCA15. Age at onset ranged from 18 to 66 years 
      (mean [SD] age, 35 [16] years). The symptom at onset was cerebellar gait ataxia, 
      except in 1 patient with isolated upper limb tremor. Although families were 
      tested irrespective of their phenotype, patients with SCA15 had a homogeneous 
      phenotype and were characterized by a slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia. 
      However, pyramidal signs (2 patients) and mild cognitive problems (2 patients) 
      were occasionally present. Radiologic findings showed global or predominant 
      vermian cerebellar atrophy in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this series, ITPR1 
      deletions were rare and accounted for approximately 1% of all autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxias. The SCA15 phenotype mostly consists of a slowly progressive 
      isolated cerebellar ataxia with variable age at onset; an additional pyramidal 
      syndrome and problems in executive functions may be present.

TI  - ATXN-2 CAG repeat expansions are interrupted in ALS patients.
PG  - 575-80
LID - 10.1007/s00439-011-1000-2 [doi]
AB  - It has recently been suggested that short expansions of CAG repeat in the gene 
      ATXN-2 causing SCA2 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 2) are associated with an 
      increased risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the populations of the 
      USA and northern Europe. In this study, we investigated the role of ATXN-2 in 
      Italian patients clinically diagnosed with ALS and characterized the molecular 
      structure of ATXN-2 expansions. We assessed the size of the CAG repeat in ATXN-2 
      exon 1 in 232 Italian ALS patients and 395 matched controls. ATXN-2 expanded 
      alleles containing > 30 repeats have been observed in seven sporadic ALS patients 
      (3.0%), while being absent in the controls (p = 0.00089). Four out of the seven 
      patients had an ATXN-2 allele in the intermediate-fully pathological range: one 
      with 32 repeats, 2 with 33 repeats and 1 with 37 repeats, accounting for 1.7% of 
      the ALS cohort. Sequencing of expanded (> 32) alleles showed that they were all 
      interrupted with at least one CAA triplet. ATXN-2 alleles with the same length 
      and structure have been reported in SCA2 patients with parkinsonism or in 
      familial and sporadic Parkinson. Conversely, the phenotype of the present 
      patients was typically ALS with no signs or symptoms of ataxia or parkinsonism. 
      In conclusion, the findings of ATXN-2 expansions in pure ALS cases suggest that 
      ALS may be a third phenotype (alongside ataxia/parkinsonism and pure Parkinson) 
      associated with ATXN-2 interrupted alleles.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 15: diagnostic assessment, frequency, and phenotypic 
      features.
PG  - 407-12
LID - 10.1136/jmg.2010.087023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To guide time- and cost-efficient analyses of the increasing number 
      of autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxia genes (SCAs), more information about 
      frequency distributions, phenotypic characteristics and optimal diagnostic 
      strategies is warranted. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and phenotypic 
      spectrum of SCA15 and to confirm multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification 
      (MLPA) as a robust and efficient strategy for routine molecular diagnosis. 
      METHODS: Fifty-six German SCA families negative for common repeat expansions were 
      screened for ITPR1 deletions by MLPA. Samples with conspicuous MLPA data were 
      additionally assessed by high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array 
      to confirm MLPA results and further determine the size of deletions. The 
      phenotype of patients harbouring ITPR1 deletions was characterised by 
      standardised clinical, electrophysiological and imaging assessment. RESULTS: 
      SCA15 accounted for 8.9% (5/56) of SCA families negative for common SCA repeat 
      expansions. All deletions detected by MLPA were confirmed by SNP array. One of 
      the ITPR1 deletions preserved exons 1 and 2 in the 5' prime UTR of the ITPR1 
      gene. All patients with SCA15 (n=10) presented with slowly progressive cerebellar 
      ataxia and vermal cerebellar atrophy, while clinical and electrophysiological 
      signs of extracerebellar affection were mild and more variable. CONCLUSIONS: 
      SCA15 is the most common non-trinucleotide repeat SCA in Central Europe. 
      Screening for ITPR1 deletions should be considered in patients with slowly 
      progressive SCA, vermal cerebellar atrophy and prominent tremor after excluding 
      common SCA repeat expansions. Promoter and exon 2 of ITPR1 may be preserved from 
      the deletion in some cases of SCA15.

TI  - Quantification of circulating plasma DNA in Friedreich's ataxia and

PG  - 389-94

AB  - DNA triplet repeat expansion-associated ataxias, Friedreich's ataxia, and 
      different types of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are progressive multisystem 
      neurodegenerative disorders. The diagnosis of this wide group of inherited 
      ataxias is essentially based on clinical findings. Cell-free circulating DNA in 
      plasma has been considered as a powerful tool in clinical diagnosis and prognosis 
      of several human diseases. In the present study, clinically suspected patients 
      were assessed on the International Co-operative Ataxia Rating Scale and further 
      confirmed by molecular analysis of DNA triplet repeats. Quantification of plasma 
      DNA using a highly sensitive and DNA-specific PicoGreen fluorescent assay was 
      done. We found significantly high levels (p < 0.001) of plasma DNA of 
      167 +/- 43 ng/mL in Friedreich's ataxia patients (n = 15), 148 +/- 29 ng/mL in SCA2 
      patients (n = 10), and 137 +/- 29 ng/mL in SCA12 patients (n = 25), whereas those 
      of healthy controls (n = 20) was only 59 +/- 15 ng/mL. Therefore, we were able to 
      distinguish between ataxia patients and healthy controls using plasma DNA. 
      Although the precise mechanism by which plasma DNA enters into circulation is not 
      known, significantly higher concentrations of plasma DNA appears to be due to 
      neuronal and muscular degeneration in these patients. Identification of genes in 
      plasma DNA, which are overexpressed or novel, can be a promising tool for the 
      prognosis of these diseases.

TI  - DNA tandem repeat instability in the Escherichia coli chromosome is stimulated by 
      mismatch repair at an adjacent CAG.CTG trinucleotide repeat.
PG  - 22582-6
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1012906108 [doi]
AB  - Approximately half the human genome is composed of repetitive DNA sequences 
      classified into microsatellites, minisatellites, tandem repeats, and dispersed 
      repeats. These repetitive sequences have coevolved within the genome but little 
      is known about their potential interactions. Trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) are a 
      subclass of microsatellites that are implicated in human disease. Expansion of 
      CAG.CTG TNRs is responsible for Huntington disease, myotonic dystrophy, and a 
      number of spinocerebellar ataxias. In yeast DNA double-strand break (DSB) 
      formation has been proposed to be associated with instability and chromosome 
      fragility at these sites and replication fork reversal (RFR) to be involved 
      either in promoting or in preventing instability. However, the molecular basis 
      for chromosome fragility of repetitive DNA remains poorly understood. Here we 
      show that a CAG.CTG TNR array stimulates instability at a 275-bp tandem repeat 
      located 6.3 kb away on the Escherichia coli chromosome. Remarkably, this 
      stimulation is independent of both DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR) and RFR 
      but is dependent on a functional mismatch repair (MMR) system. Our results 
      provide a demonstration, in a simple model system, that MMR at one type of 
      repetitive DNA has the potential to influence the stability of another. 
      Furthermore, the mechanism of this stimulation places a limit on the universality 
      of DSBR or RFR models of instability and chromosome fragility at CAG.CTG TNR 
      sequences. Instead, our data suggest that explanations of chromosome fragility 
      should encompass the possibility of chromosome gaps formed during MMR.

TI  - Gray and white matter alterations in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7: an in vivo 
      DTI and VBM study.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.12.014 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by cerebellar ataxia and visual loss. It is caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the gene encoding the ataxin 7 protein. Visual loss is due to a 
      progressive atrophy of photoreceptor cells that results in macular degeneration 
      in more advanced stages. Initial semiautomatic measures in magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) studies on the brain stem have shown a diminished volume mainly in 
      the cerebellum and pons, while T2 images have shown hyperintensities in 
      transverse fibers at the pons. Neuropathological research, however, has shown 
      more widespread brain damage including loss of myelinated fibers. In this study 
      we decided to take advantage of recent MRI methodological advances to further 
      explore the gray and white matter changes that occur in SCA7 patients. We studied 
      nine genetically confirmed SCA7 patients and their matched controls using voxel 
      based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics. As expected, we found 
      significant bilateral gray matter volume reductions (p<0.05, corrected for 
      multiple comparisons) in patients' cerebellar cortex. However, we also found 
      significant bilateral gray matter reductions in pre and postcentral gyrus, 
      inferior and medial frontal, parietal inferior, parahippocampal and occipital 
      cortices. The analysis also showed a decrement in fractional anisotropy (p<0.05, 
      corrected) of SCA7 patients in the cerebellum's white matter, brainstem, 
      cerebellar and cerebral peduncles, midbrain, anterior and posterior internal 
      capsule, external/extreme capsule, corpus callosum, corona radiata, optical 
      radiations, and the occipital, temporal and frontal lobe's white matter. These 
      results confirm previous evidence of widespread damage beyond the cerebellum and 
      the pons in SCA7 patients. They also confirmed previous results that had been 
      only detectable through neuropathological analyses and, more importantly, 
      identified new regions affected by the disease that previous methods could not 
      detect. These new results could help explain the symptom's spectrum that affects 
      these patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To map the disease locus and to identify a gene mutation in a 
      Japanese family with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia. DESIGN: A genome-wide 
      linkage analysis was performed using the Affymetrix genome-wide human 
      single-nucleotide polymorphism array containing 909 622 single-nucleotide 
      polymorphisms. Direct nucleotide sequencing of a candidate gene was performed. 
      SETTING: Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine and Tokyo University 
      Graduate School of Medicine. Patients  Four affected and 6 healthy individuals in 
      a family with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia. RESULTS: One locus on 
      chromosome 5q had a multipoint logarithm of odds score of 2.408, the theoretical 
      maximum. This locus was flanked by markers rs681591 and rs32582 and includes 
      PPP2R2B (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory subunit B, beta isoform), the 
      causative gene of autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia 12 (SCA12). However, 
      unlike SCA12, no CAG repeat expansions in the promoter region and no nucleotide 
      substitution or insertion-deletion mutations in the exons of the PPP2R2B gene 
      were found. CONCLUSION: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia mapping to 
      5q31-q33.1 has no CAG repeat expansion or other mutations of the PPP2R2B gene.

AB  - In polyglutamine disorders, the length of the expanded CAG repeat shows a strong 
      inverse correlation with the age at disease onset, yet up to 50% of the variation 
      in age of onset is determined by other additional factors. Here, we investigated 
      whether variations in the expression of heat shock proteins (HSP) are related to 
      differences in the age of onset in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)3. 
      Hereto, we analysed the protein expression levels of HSPA1A (HSP70), HSPA8 
      (HSC70), DNAJB (HSP40) and HSPB1 (HSP27) in fibroblasts from patients and healthy 
      controls. HSPB1 levels were significantly upregulated in fibroblasts from 
      patients with SCA3, but without relation to age of onset. Exclusively for 
      expression of DNAJB family members, a correlation was found with the age of onset 
      independent of the length of the CAG repeat expansion. This indicates that DNAJB 
      members might be contributors to the variation in age of onset and underlines the 
      possible use of DNAJB proteins as therapeutic targets.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (SCA11) is an uncommon cause of dominant ataxia 
      among French and German kindreds.
PG  - 1229-32
LID - 10.1136/jnnp.2009.202150 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: At least 28 loci have been linked to autosomal dominant 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (ADCA). Causative genes have been cloned for 10 nucleotide 
      repeat expansions (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17 and 31) and six genes with 
      classical mutations (SCA5, 13, 14, 15/16, 27 and 28). Recently, a large British 
      pedigree linked to SCA11 has been reported to carry a mutation in the TTBK2 gene. 
      In order to assess the prevalence and phenotypic spectrum of SCA11, the authors 
      screened 148 index patients of predominantly German (n=69) and French (n=79) 
      descent with ADCA tested negative for a panel of SCA mutations (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 
      and 17), for mutations in TTBK2. METHODS: In the German ADCA cohort, the complete 
      coding sequence of the TTBK2 gene was PCR-amplified and screened for mutations by 
      high-resolution-melting (HRM) analysis. In the French cohort, exons known to 
      carry mutations were directly sequenced. For both cohorts, the gene-dosage 
      alterations were assessed using a customised multiplex ligation probe 
      amplification (MLPA) assay. RESULTS: In two of 148 ADCA families--one German and 
      one French--the authors identified a potentially disease-causing SCA11 mutation. 
      Interestingly, both carried an identical two-basepair deletion (c.1306_1307delGA, 
      p.D435fs448X in exon 12) leading to a premature stop codon. Gene-dosage 
      alterations were not detected in the TTBK2 gene. Clinically, the SCA11 patients 
      had phenotypic characteristics as described before presenting with slowly 
      progressive almost pure cerebellar ataxia with normal life expectancy. 
      CONCLUSION: SCA11 presented as ADCA III according to Harding's classification and 
      is a rare cause of spinocerebellar ataxia in Caucasians accounting for less than 
      1% of dominant ataxias in central Europe.

PG  - 1577-82
LID - 10.1002/mds.22857 [doi]
AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinically and 
      genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders. We investigated 
      an SCA family from Serbia of Roma ethnic origin; four affected and nine 
      unaffected family members underwent a detailed neurological examination. The 
      presenting symptom in all patients was gait unsteadiness in early adulthood. 
      Additional features included pyramidal signs, depression, and cognitive 
      impairment. The condition follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. 
      After excluding repeat expansions in nine known SCA genes, a genome-wide linkage 
      analysis with 412 microsatellite markers localized the putative disease gene to a 
      40.7 cM (42.5 Mb) region on chromosome 15q between markers D15S1006 and D15S116. 
      The maximum model-based multipoint LOD score was 1.75. This region is only 4.3 Mb 
      away from the SCA11 (TTBK2) gene. Accordingly, mutations in TTBK2 were not found, 
      suggesting a second SCA gene on chromosome 15q as cause of this novel form of 
      SCA. In addition, we excluded alterations in two candidate genes in the linked 
      region, namely expansion of a polyglutamine-coding CAG repeat in ARID3B and 
      mutations in SEMA6D.

TI  - Involvement of Onuf's nucleus in Machado-Joseph disease: a morphometric and 
      immunohistochemical study.
PG  - 439-48
LID - 10.1007/s00401-010-0699-5 [doi]
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in the MJD1 gene, in which lower urinary 
      tract dysfunction is known to be the most commonly encountered autonomic failure. 
      However, it remains unclear whether Onuf's nucleus (ON), which plays major roles 
      in the micturition reflex and voluntary continence, degenerates during the 
      disease process. In the present study, we conducted a morphometric and 
      immunohistochemical study of ON, together with the lateral nuclear group (LNG) of 
      the sacral anterior horns, in seven patients with MJD. When compared with 
      controls, the number of lower motor neurons in both ON and LNG was significantly 
      smaller in the MJD patients, the former being inversely correlated with the size 
      of the expanded CAG repeats. Notably, MJD patients with a large CAG-repeat 
      expansion showed an ON-predominant pattern of neuronal loss, while in the 
      remaining patients, ON and LNG were affected to a similar degree, or rather an 
      LNG-predominant pattern of neuronal loss was evident. Moreover, when adjusted for 
      age, the degree of neuronal loss in both ON and LNG was significantly correlated 
      with the extent of expansion of the CAG repeats. In MJD, the remaining lower 
      motor neurons in ON often exhibited ataxin-3- or 1C2-immunoreactive (ir) neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusions, while no pTDP-43-ir neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions were 
      present in these neurons. In conclusion, the present findings strongly suggest 
      that neuronal loss in ON, the degree of which is highly influenced by the extent 
      of expansion of CAG repeats, is a consistent feature in MJD.

AB  - Small heat-shock proteins (sHsps) are molecular chaperones that play an important 
      protective role against cellular protein misfolding by interacting with partially 
      unfolded proteins on their off-folding pathway, preventing their aggregation. 
      Polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion leads to the formation of fibrillar 
      protein aggregates and neuronal cell death in nine diseases, including Huntington 
      disease and the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). There is evidence that sHsps have 
      a role in suppression of polyQ-induced neurodegeneration; for example, the sHsp 
      alphaB-crystallin (alphaB-c) has been identified as a suppressor of SCA3 toxicity 
      in a Drosophila model. However, the molecular mechanism for this suppression is 
      unknown. In this study we tested the ability of alphaB-c to suppress the 
      aggregation of a polyQ protein. We found that alphaB-c does not inhibit the 
      formation of SDS-insoluble polyQ fibrils. We further tested the effect of 
      alphaB-c on the aggregation of ataxin-3, a polyQ protein that aggregates via a 
      two-stage aggregation mechanism. The first stage involves association of the 
      N-terminal Josephin domain followed by polyQ-mediated interactions and the 
      formation of SDS-resistant mature fibrils. Our data show that alphaB-c potently 
      inhibits the first stage of ataxin-3 aggregation; however, the second 
      polyQ-dependent stage can still proceed. By using NMR spectroscopy, we have 
      determined that alphaB-c interacts with an extensive region on the surface of the 
      Josephin domain. These data provide an example of a domain/region flanking an 
      amyloidogenic sequence that has a critical role in modulating aggregation of a 
      polypeptide and plays a role in the interaction with molecular chaperones to 
      prevent this aggregation.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 is an untreatable CAG repeat expansion disorder whose 
      natural history is not completely understood. Our aims were to describe the 
      progression of neurological manifestations in a long-term cohort of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 3, and to verify if CAG expanded repeat, gender, and age 
      at onset were associated with the rate of progression. Patients entered the study 
      between 1998 and 2005 and were seen until 2007. On each visit, the validated 
      NESSCA scale, an inventory of 18 neurological manifestations, was applied. Scores 
      observed in each year of disease duration produced a Growth Curve, which was 
      analyzed through the random coefficients model. Scores obtained in some 
      individual items were described through multi-state Markov models. One hundred 
      fifty-six patients (78 families) were recruited; 28 were lost, and 23 died. Mean 
      (sd) ages at onset and at baseline were 32.8 (10.6) and 40.7 (12.8) years; median 
      (range) expanded CAGn was 74 (67-85). Three hundred fifteen NESSCA evaluations 
      were performed, comprising disease durations from zero to 34 years. The 105 
      patients who completed the study were seen over 5 (sd = 2.4) years at intervals 
      of 2.5 (sd = 1.5) years. The trajectory of NESSCA obtained for the overall group 
      increased by 1.26 points per year. This slope increased by 0.15 points per each 
      additional CAG in the expanded repeat (p < 0.0002) and decreased by 0.03 points 
      per each additional year of age at onset (p = 0.005). NESSCA worsened steadily, 
      producing linear trajectories, which were faster among patients with longer 
      expanded repeats (>74) and with lower ages at onset (<34 years).

TI  - High frequency of Machado-Joseph disease identified in southeastern Chinese 
      kindreds with spinocerebellar ataxia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), caused by a CAG repeat expansion 
      located in exon10 of the ATXN3 gene, is now regarded as one of the most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) in the world. The relative frequency of MJD among 
      SCA has previously been estimated at about 50% in the Chinese population and has 
      been reported to be related to the frequency of large normal alleles in some 
      populations. Taq polymerase has been used for PCR in nearly all studies reported 
      previously. METHODS: Normal and expanded alleles of ATXN3 were detected via PCR 
      using LA Taq DNA polymerase (better for GC-rich sequences) and denaturing 
      polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 150 normal individuals and 138 unrelated 
      probands from autosomal dominant SCA families. To compare reaction efficiency, 12 
      MJD patients' expanded alleles were amplified with La Taq and Taq polymerase 
      respectively in the same amplifying systems and reaction conditions. RESULTS: 
      Normal alleles ranged from 12 to 42 CAG repeats. The most common allele contained 
      14 repeats with a frequency of 23.3%, which corroborates previous reports. The 
      frequency of large normal alleles (>27 repeats) was 0.28, which was very high 
      relative to previous reports. The frequency of MJD in SCA patients was 72.5%, 
      which was significantly higher than those in previous reports about the Chinese 
      and other Asian populations. This frequency was one of the highest reported 
      worldwide, with only Portuguese and Brazilian populations exhibiting higher 
      proportions. All 12 expanded alleles were amplified in PCR with La Taq 
      polymerase, whereas only 2 expanded alleles were amplified with Taq polymerase. 
      CONCLUSION: We have first reported the highest relative frequency of MJD in Asia, 
      and we attribute this high frequency to a more efficient PCR using LA Taq 
      polymerase and hypothesized that large ANs may act as a reservoir for expanded 
      alleles in the Southeastern Chinese population.

AB  - We report on a Chinese family with three members who have CAG repeat expansion in 
      the ataxin-3, two members present with expanded trinucleotide repeat in both the 
      ataxin-3 and tata-binding protein (TBP) and an individual who carries expanded 
      CAG/CAA repeat in the TBP. Only the patients who carry an allele with expansion 
      in the ataxin-3 gene presented with clinical symptoms. This interesting family 
      presents a unique mutation state. We will continue to track this family in the 
      future, which may help us further elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 3 and 17. The study also provides us a novel 
      conception that mutations from two pathogenetic genes may coexist in one patient 
      and SCA-affected patients with intermediate allele need to be further excluded 
      for other SCA subtypes.

AB  - The diagnosis and incidence of spinocerebelar ataxias (SCA) is sometimes 
      difficult to analyze due the overlap of phenotypes subtypes and are disorders of 
      mutations caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion. To investigate the 
      incidence of the SCA in Southern Brazil, we analyzed the trinucleotide repeats 
      (CAG)n at the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7 loci to identify allele size ranges 
      and frequencies. We examined blood sample from 154 asymptomatic blood donors and 
      115 individuals with progressive ataxias. PCR products were submitted to 
      capillary electrophoresis. In the blood donors, the ranges of the five loci were: 
      SCA1, 19 to 36 (CAG)n; SCA2, 6 to 28 (CAG)n; SCA3, 12 to 34 (CAG)n; SCA6, 2 to 13 
      (CAG)n; and SCA7, 2 to 10 (CAG)n. No deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
      were detected. In the ataxia group, we found (CAG)n above the range of the 
      asymptomatic blood donors in SCA3 (21.74%) followed by SCA2 (5.22%), SCA7 
      (2.61%), SCA6 (0.87%), and no cases of SCA1. The remaining 80 cases (69.56%) have 
      different diagnoses from the type here studied. These data defined the alleles 
      and their frequencies, as well as demonstrated their stability in the population 
      not affected. The molecular diagnosis test confirmed the clinical diagnosis in 
      28/45 cases and classified another 7/70 from the clinical unclassified ataxias 
      group.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathy (PN) has long been recognized in Machado-Joseph disease 
      (MJD), but its natural history is an unsettled issue. Therefore, we prospectively 
      assessed 40 with MJD for 13 months with nerve conduction (NC) studies and the 
      revised total neuropathy score (TNSr) to study the progression of PN. There was 
      no significant change in the TNSr score over the follow-up period. In contrast, 
      the average sural sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude decreased 
      significantly over the same interval from a mean of 13.2 muV to 9.8 muV (P < 
      0.001). There was an inverse correlation between the change in the sural SNAP 
      amplitude and the length of the CAG triplet repeat expansion (r = 0.574, P < 
      0.001). The reduction in the mean sural SNAP amplitude also correlated with 
      progression of ataxia. This indicates that PN progresses faster in individuals 
      with larger (CAG)(n) expansions, and nerve conduction studies may be useful to 
      study disease progression in MJD.

AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disease characterized by gait and limb ataxia. This disease is 
      caused by the expansion of a (CAG)(n) located in the ATXN2, that encodes a 
      polyglutamine tract of more than 34 repeats. Lately, alleles with 32-33 CAGs have 
      been associated to late-onset disease cases. Repeat interruptions by CAA triplets 
      are common in normal alleles, while expanded alleles usually contain a pure 
      repeat tract. To investigate the mutational origin and the instability associated 
      to the ATXN2 repeat, we performed an extensive haplotype study and sequencing of 
      the CAG/CAA repeat, in a cohort of families of different geographic origins and 
      phenotypes. Our results showed (1) CAA interruptions also in expanded ATXN2 
      alleles; (2) that pathological CAA interrupted alleles shared an ancestral 
      haplotype with pure expanded alleles; and (3) higher genetic diversity in 
      European SCA2 families, suggesting an older European ancestry of SCA2. In 
      conclusion, we found instability towards expansion in interrupted ATXN2 alleles 
      and a shared ancestral ATXN2 haplotype for pure and interrupted expanded alleles; 
      this finding has strong implications in mutation diagnosis and counseling. Our 
      results indicate that interrupted alleles, below the pathological threshold, may 
      be a reservoir of mutable alleles, prone to expansion in subsequent generations, 
      leading to full disease mutation.

TI  - Alu-mediated acquisition of unstable ATTCT pentanucleotide repeats in the human 
      ATXN10 gene.
PG  - 2573-9
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msp172 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 is caused by ATTCT repeat expansion in the ATXN10 
      gene in humans. We studied the evolutionary history of the human genome to 
      determine the time and mechanism of the acquisition of unstable ATTCT repeats in 
      the genome. We found that long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) was inserted into 
      ATXN10 intron 9; Alu was then inserted in the middle of LINE-1; and endogenous 
      retrovilcus K was lastly retrotransposed in the middle of Alu. The ATTCT repeat 
      was located on the boundary between the 3'-end of the Alu element and the direct 
      repeat arising from LINE-1. We determined nucleotide sequences of the orthologous 
      region of 50 individuals representing 33 primate species and compared them with 
      the human sequence. The analysis revealed that the ATTCT repeat is present only 
      in human and apes. Old World monkeys also possess pentanucleotide repeats, but 
      their motifs are TGTCT and GGTCT. New World monkeys and prosimians are not 
      informative because they lack the corresponding region in ATXN10 intron 9. Our 
      studies dictate two parsimonious scenarios of evolution. First, a TTTCT motif 
      arose from a TTTTT motif at the junction of Alu and LINE-1, which was followed by 
      introduction of A to make an ATTCT motif in hominoids. Second, an ATTCT motif was 
      directly generated from an ancestral ATTTT motif in the common ancestor of 
      catarrhines. We also demonstrate that orangutan uniquely introduced G to make a 
      GTTCT motif and later C to make a GTTCC motif, where newly introduced nucleotides 
      are underlined. Our studies reveal that nucleotide substitutions in a poly(A) 
      tail of the Alu element and the following amplification of pentanucleotides 
      occurred in the lineages of Old World monkeys and hominoids and that unstable 
      ATTCT pentanucleotide repeats originated in the common ancestor of hominoids. 
      These findings also highlight a new aspect of the role of retrotransposons in 
      human disease and evolution, which might be useful in investigating the mystery 
      of human uniqueness.

      clinic.
PG  - 121-4
LID - 10.1016/j.jns.2009.06.027 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is an 
      autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by cerebellar ataxia 
      associated with varying phenotypic variability. It was reported that a few of 
      SCA3/MJD patients showed marked spastic paraplegia with or without cerebellar 
      ataxia, which was partially first diagnosed as hereditary spastic paraplegia 
      (HSP) and considered to be a new subtype (subtype V). But the data in China is 
      still absent. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mutation frequency and clinical 
      features of subtype V of SCA3/MJD in Chinese patients with HSP. METHODS: Mutation 
      detection of MJD1 gene was carried out in 46 AD-HSP families and 58 sporadic 
      cases. RESULTS: Expanded CAG repeats that ranged from 64 to 81 of MJD1 gene were 
      found in six probands from 46 AD-HSP families (13%, 6/46). No abnormal repeat 
      expansion was found in sporadic cases (0/58). The initial symptoms of six SCA3 
      cases were all spasticity in the lower limbs, and nystagmus, dysphagia and 
      dysarthria that occurred with disease progression seemed more frequent than HSP. 
      CONCLUSION: Subtype V of SCA3/MJD is not rare in China, but it is hard to 
      distinguish between HSP and SCA3/MJD only by clinical manifestation and MRI, and 
      MJD1 gene should be detected routinely in the patients diagnosed as HSP in 
      clinic.

TI  - Huntington's disease-like and ataxia syndromes: identification of a family with a 
      de novo SCA17/TBP mutation.
PG  - 12-5
LID - 10.1016/j.parkreldis.2009.06.006 [doi]
AB  - The autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias, commonly referred to as SCAs, are 
      clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders. 
      Twenty-eight genetic subtypes have been identified, of which 7 are caused by 
      expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat that encodes a polyglutamine tract in the 
      respective proteins. SCA17 is caused by a CAG/CAA repeat expansion in the TATA 
      box-binding protein-gene (TBP). In some cases the clinical phenotype of SCA17 
      overlaps that of Huntington's disease (HD), hence the use of the term 
      Huntington's disease-like. We screened 89 patients with a Huntington's 
      disease-like phenotype without the HD-gene mutation and 178 patients with 
      genetically unclassified cerebellar ataxia for the mutation in TBP. A 33-year old 
      woman presenting with an HD like phenotype with a de novo 54 CAG/CAA repeat 
      expansion was identified. Her normal allele included 38 repeats. The patient's 
      mother and father both carried normal range repeats, 38/38 and 33/39 
      respectively. Analysis of the repeat structures revealed that the expansion had 
      occurred upon expansion of the longer paternal allele. We conclude that, however 
      rare, SCA17 must be considered as a cause of Huntington's disease-like phenotypes 
      and ataxia syndromes, also in isolated cases.

AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) with autosomal dominant inheritance are a 
      clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurological disorders with 
      overlapping as well as highly variable phenotypes primarily affecting the 
      cerebellum. To date, 28 different loci have been identified. Nine SCAs are caused 
      by repeat expansions; for 14 only the chromosomal localisation is known. 
      Recently, two frameshift mutations in the tau tubulin kinase 2 gene (TTBK2) were 
      reported to cause SCA11. To evaluate the frequency of mutations in the TTBK2 
      gene, we performed molecular genetic analyses in 49 unrelated familial cases with 
      ataxia. Sequencing all coding exons revealed, amongst others, two novel missense 
      exchanges at evolutionarily conserved amino acid positions. Although being unique 
      in 98 alleles of ataxia patients, a disease causing effect can be excluded with 
      high probability for both variations. This result demonstrates the challenges in 
      diagnostic testing for SCA11.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The association between cerebellar ataxia and hypogonadism is seen 
      rarely and is not well recognized. Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is an autosomal 
      dominantly inherited, progressive ataxia disorder, and SCA type 2 (SCA2) 
      characteristically presents with a highly variable phenotype with multisystemic 
      involvement. Although the clinical spectrum of SCA2 is broad, hypogonadism has 
      not been reported as an accompanying symptom. AIM: To report a case study that 
      describes hypergonadotropic hypogonadism as a non-neurological manifestation of 
      cerebellar ataxia in a patient with a hereditary trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      disorder, SCA2. METHODS: Case report of a man admitted to an academic medical 
      center. RESULTS: A 45-year-old man with a history of azoospermia in work-up for 
      infertility was admitted for evaluation of a left-side hand tremor, instability 
      on walking and impaired balance. Upon physical examination, the patient had a 
      micropenis about 3 cm in length and had decreased testicular size (12 cc each) on 
      orchidometry, but normal secondary sexual characteristics and average stature. 
      Laboratory tests showed the presence of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. A brain 
      magnetic resonance imaging scan showed marked atrophy involving both the 
      cerebellum and pons. Genetic analysis for hereditary ataxia demonstrated the 
      presence of a 37 CAG triplet expansion in the mutated allele (genotype 22/37) in 
      the SCA2 gene, confirming the diagnosis of SCA2. CONCLUSION: The present study 
      suggests that a common genetic implication may be shared between these neurologic 
      and non-neurologic signs, and there may be various associations between these 
      heterogeneous manifestations. The clinical spectrum of the SCA2 should be 
      widened, and further data collection is needed to elucidate the relationship 
      among the clinical manifestations.

TI  - SCA-LSVD: a repeat-oriented locus-specific variation database for genotype to 
      phenotype correlations in spinocerebellar ataxias.

AB  - Repeat expansion has been implicated in 10 out of 17 candidate genes identified 
      for autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs)-commonly referred as 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Though genetically distinct, the SCAs share a 
      large number of features that confound their clinical classification. In 
      addition, there is a difference in the prevalence and phenotypic expression of 
      ataxias between different ethnic groups. We have created a new SCA-locus-specific 
      variation database (LSVD) that aims to catalog and integrate information on SCAs 
      associated with trinucleotide repeat expansion (SCA1, SCA 2, SCA 3, SCA 6, SCA 7, 
      SCA 8, SCA 12, SCA 17, Friedreich's ataxia [FRDA], and 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA]) from all over the world. The 
      database has been developed using the Leiden Open (source) Variation Database 
      (LOVD) software (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands). The 
      database houses detailed information on clinical features, such as age and 
      symptom at onset, mode of inheritance, and genotype information, pertaining to 
      the SCA patients from more than 400 families across India. All the compiled 
      genotype data conforms to the HGVS Nomenclature guidelines. This would be a very 
      useful starting point for understanding the molecular correlates of phenotypes in 
      ataxia-a multilocus disease in which related molecular mechanisms converge to 
      overlapping phenotypes.

TI  - SCA8 repeat expansion: large CTA/CTG repeat alleles in neurological disorders and 
      functional implications.
PG  - 437-44
LID - 10.1007/s00439-009-0641-x [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) involves bidirectional expression of CUG 
      (ATXN8OS) and CAG (ATXN8) expansion transcripts. The pathogenesis of SCA8 is 
      complex and the spectrum of clinical presentations is broad. In the present 
      study, we assessed the SCA8 repeat size ranges in Taiwanese Parkinson's disease, 
      Alzheimer's disease and atypical parkinsonism and investigated the genetic 
      variation modulating ATXN8 expression. Thirteen large SCA8 alleles and a novel 
      ATXN8 -62 G/A promoter SNP were found. There is a significant difference in the 
      proportion of the individuals carrying SCA8 larger alleles in atypical 
      parkinsonism (P = 0.044) as compared to that in the control subjects. In 
      lymphoblastoid cells carrying SCA8 large alleles, treatment of MG-132 or 
      staurosporine significantly increases the cell death or caspase 3 activity. 
      Although expressed at low steady-state, ATXN8 expression level is significantly 
      higher (P = 0.012) in cells with SCA8 large alleles than that of the control 
      cells. The ATXN8 transcriptional activity was significantly higher in the 
      luciferase reporter construct containing the -62G allele than that containing the 
      -62A allele in both neuroblastoma and embryonic kidney cells. Therefore, our 
      preliminary results suggest that ATXN8 gene -62 G/A polymorphism may be 
      functional in modulating ATXN8 expression.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a physically devastating, genetically inherited 
      disorder characterized by abnormal brain function that results in the progressive 
      loss of the ability to coordinate movements. There are many types of SCAs as 
      there are various gene mutations that can cause this disease. SCA types 1-3, 
      6-10, 12, and 17 result from a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the DNA-coding 
      sequence. Intriguingly, recent work has demonstrated that increased trinucleotde 
      expansions in the SCA7 gene result in defect in the function of the SAGA histone 
      acetyltransferase complex. The SCA7 gene encodes a subunit of the SAGA complex. 
      This subunit is conserved in yeast as the SGF73 gene. We demonstrate that Sgf73 
      is required to recruit the histone deubiquitination module into both SAGA and the 
      related SliK(SALSA) complex, and to maintain levels of histone ubiquitination, 
      which is necessary for regulation of transcription at a number of genes.

TI  - Vertigo and vestibular abnormalities in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 78-82
LID - 10.1007/s00415-009-0068-2 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a calcium channelopathy due to a 
      pathological CAG repeat expansion in CACNL1A4. Patients frequently describe 
      paroxysmal vertigo early in the disease course, but it is not clear whether this 
      is central or labyrinthine in origin. To address this issue we studied 21 SCA6 
      patients. Symptoms of vertigo were defined using a structured questionnaire. 
      Signs were recorded during a standardised bed-side vestibular examination that 
      included systematic positional testing with Frenzel goggles.Brief, recurrent 
      attacks of vertigo occurred in 13 patients, usually preceding the onset of 
      ataxia. Nystagmus was observed behind Frenzel goggles in 14 patients, and was 
      induced either during positional testing, or head shaking in 20 patients. Only 
      one patient had findings typical of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). 
      Combined downbeat and horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus ("side-pocket") was the 
      most common form, occurring most commonly in supine and head-hanging positions, 
      and following horizontal head-shaking. Nystagmus beating away from the ground 
      (apogeotropic) occurred in 9 patients as they lay on their side.In conclusion, 
      vertigo and abnormalities on bedside vestibular examination are common in SCA6, 
      with forms of nystagmus typical of cerebellar, rather than labyrinthine, disease. 
      These findings demonstrate phenotypic overlap between SCA6 and episodic ataxia 
      type 2, which are both due to mutations in CACNL1A4.

      ataxias.
PG  - 16-22
LID - 10.1159/000170885 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) comprise a heterogeneous group of 
      severe late-onset neurodegenerative diseases that are promoted by the expansion 
      of a tandem-arrayed DNA sequence that modifies the primary structure of the 
      protein. METHODS: Genomic DNA of 20 patients affected with SCAs was extracted 
      from peripheral blood and screened for deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). 
      Sequencing of tRNA(Leu), tRNA(Lys), cytochrome oxidase II, ATPase 6/8 and NADH 
      dehydrogenase I (NDI) genes belonging to mtDNA from patients with SCAs was also 
      carried out to detect the presence of variations. RESULTS: We identified 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeat expansions in 20 patients. 
      Seven of these patients had at least one nucleotide change in mtDNA. In such 
      cases, 5 nucleotide variations resulted in amino acid changes with two novel 
      variations T8256G and G9010A. CONCLUSION: SCA patients showed high levels of 
      mtDNA variations in lymphocytes. It can be proposed that the SCA gene proteins 
      (Ataxins) are involved in the complicated intracellular mechanisms that affect 
      cellular organelles and their components, such as the mitochondrial genome. The 
      instability of CAG repeats in polyglutamine diseases such as SCAs and 
      Huntington's disease might be a causative factor in mtDNA variation or possible 
      damage.

TI  - Two young sisters with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 showing different clinical 
      progression of disease.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the ataxin-2 gene. Gain-of-toxic effects caused by expanded 
      polyglutamine tracts are important for the disease pathogenesis and there is an 
      inverse relationship between the number of CAG repeats and the age of onset and 
      clinical severity. Previously, we reported an extended Turkish family with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 with several affected members in three generations. 
      Two sisters in this generation showed an earlier age of onset (5 and 7 years, 
      respectively) than their father (30 years). In this paper, we present a further 
      interesting finding regarding the disease onset and manifestation in the two 
      sisters. Interestingly, the age of onset was delayed and the clinical severity of 
      the disease was milder in the child who had more CAG repeats (84 vs. 70). This 
      finding suggests that there are other factors contributing to the age of onset 
      and clinical severity in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 other than the increased 
      CAG repeat.

TI  - CTCF cis-regulates trinucleotide repeat instability in an epigenetic manner: a 
      novel basis for mutational hot spot determination.

LID - e1000257
AB  - At least 25 inherited disorders in humans result from microsatellite repeat 
      expansion. Dramatic variation in repeat instability occurs at different disease 
      loci and between different tissues; however, cis-elements and trans-factors 
      regulating the instability process remain undefined. Genomic fragments from the 
      human spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) locus, containing a highly unstable 
      CAG tract, were previously introduced into mice to localize cis-acting 
      "instability elements," and revealed that genomic context is required for repeat 
      instability. The critical instability-inducing region contained binding sites for 
      CTCF -- a regulatory factor implicated in genomic imprinting, chromatin 
      remodeling, and DNA conformation change. To evaluate the role of CTCF in repeat 
      instability, we derived transgenic mice carrying SCA7 genomic fragments with CTCF 
      binding-site mutations. We found that CTCF binding-site mutation promotes triplet 
      repeat instability both in the germ line and in somatic tissues, and that CpG 
      methylation of CTCF binding sites can further destabilize triplet repeat 
      expansions. As CTCF binding sites are associated with a number of highly unstable 
      repeat loci, our findings suggest a novel basis for demarcation and regulation of 
      mutational hot spots and implicate CTCF in the modulation of genetic repeat 
      instability.

TI  - A-overhang-dependent repeat expansion determination (ADRED).
PG  - 577-80
LID - 10.2144/000112948 [doi]
AB  - In this study we present a quick and easy method for counting trinucleotide 
      repeats by de-oxyadenosine overhang (A-overhang)-dependent repeat expansion 
      determination (ADRED). During standard Taq DNA polymerase-based sequencing 
      reactions, the unterminated sequencing products of short PCR fragments are tagged 
      with a 3'-end A-overhang that is visible as an intense peak in an 
      electropherogram; this allows for easy and precise determination of the fragment 
      length and thus the extent of repeat expansions. ADRED has clear advantages over 
      existing methods, because repeat numbers of both normal and pathogenic (expanded) 
      alleles can be analyzed without using labeled primers or labeled DNA standards. 
      Because ADRED includes a sequencing step, disease-relevant polymorphisms (e.g., 
      CAA interruptions in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2) can simultaneously be 
      detected.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA 8) is an autosomal dominant 
      disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia with additional features, such as 
      upper motor neuron signs, urinary incontinence and dysphagia. From a clinical 
      standpoint, SCA 8 and the cerebellar form of multiple system atrophy (MSA-C) 
      share several common features. METHODS: We studied the presence of expanded SCA 8 
      alleles in 10 sporadic patients with probable MSA-C. RESULTS: We found 1 patient 
      with a heterozygous CTA/CTG repeat expansion in the pathological range. 
      Clinically this subject presented no features that differed from the other 
      subjects carrying smaller repeat sizes. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the 
      association of SCA 8 repeat expansions with sporadic, atypical and heterogeneous 
      phenotypes is debatable and should be interpreted with caution. Our personal 
      conclusion is that testing in such patients may become a source of diagnostic 
      confusion.

TI  - The spinocerebellar ataxia 12 gene product and protein phosphatase 2A regulatory 
      subunit Bbeta2 antagonizes neuronal survival by promoting mitochondrial fission.
PG  - 36241-8
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M800989200 [doi]
AB  - The neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia 12 (SCA12) is caused by CAG 
      repeat expansion in the non-coding region of the PPP2R2B gene. PPP2R2B encodes 
      Bbeta1 and Bbeta2, alternatively spliced and neuron-specific regulatory subunits 
      of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzyme. We show here that in PC12 cells 
      and hippocampal neurons, cell stressors induced a rapid translocation of 
      PP2A/Bbeta2 to mitochondria to promote apoptosis. Conversely, silencing of 
      PP2A/Bbeta2 protected hippocampal neurons against free radical-mediated, 
      excitotoxic, and ischemic insults. Evidence is accumulating that the 
      mitochondrial fission/fusion equilibrium is an important determinant of cell 
      survival. Accordingly, we found that Bbeta2 expression induces mitochondrial 
      fragmentation, whereas Bbeta2 silencing or inhibition resulted in mitochondrial 
      elongation. Based on epistasis experiments involving Bcl2 and core components of 
      the mitochondrial fission machinery (Fis1 and dynamin-related protein 1), 
      mitochondrial fragmentation occurs upstream of apoptosis and is both necessary 
      and sufficient for hippocampal neuron death. Our data provide the first example 
      of a proapoptotic phosphatase that predisposes to neuronal death by promoting 
      mitochondrial division and point to a possible imbalance of the mitochondrial 
      morphogenetic equilibrium in the pathogenesis of SCA12.

AB  - This is a case report of a patient with confirmed myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 6. The coexistence of two trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions in this family illustrates the importance of continued and vigilant 
      diagnostic inquiry when a patient with a confirmed genetic abnormality has an 
      atypical presentation. The coincidence of two trinucleotide repeat expansions in 
      this patient may suggest an underlying error in DNA metabolism.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 knockin mice develop a progressive neuronal 
      dysfunction with age-dependent accumulation of mutant CaV2.1 channels.
PG  - 11987-92
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0804350105 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      CAG repeat expansions within the voltage-gated calcium (Ca(V)) 2.1 channel gene. 
      It remains controversial whether the mutation exerts neurotoxicity by changing 
      the function of Ca(V)2.1 channel or through a gain-of-function mechanism 
      associated with accumulation of the expanded polyglutamine protein. We generated 
      three strains of knockin (KI) mice carrying normal, expanded, or hyperexpanded 
      CAG repeat tracts in the Cacna1a locus. The mice expressing hyperexpanded 
      polyglutamine (Sca6(84Q)) developed progressive motor impairment and aggregation 
      of mutant Ca(V)2.1 channels. Electrophysiological analysis of cerebellar Purkinje 
      cells revealed similar Ca(2+) channel current density among the three KI models. 
      Neither voltage sensitivity of activation nor inactivation was altered in the 
      Sca6(84Q) neurons, suggesting that expanded CAG repeat per se does not affect the 
      intrinsic electrophysiological properties of the channels. The pathogenesis of 
      SCA6 is apparently linked to an age-dependent process accompanied by accumulation 
      of mutant Ca(V)2.1 channels.

TI  - Bidirectional expression of the SCA8 expansion mutation: one mutation, two genes.
PG  - 150-8
LID - 10.1007/s12311-008-0010-7 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a dominantly inherited, slowly 
      progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CTG.CAG repeat expansion 
      located on chromosome 13q21. The expansion mutation was isolated directly from 
      the DNA of a single patient using RAPID cloning and subsequently shown to 
      co-segregate with disease in additional ataxia families including a 
      seven-generation kindred (the MN-A family). The size-dependent penetrance of the 
      repeat found in the large MN-A kindred makes it appear as though some parts of 
      the family have a dominant disorder while other parts of this same family have 
      recessive or sporadic forms of ataxia. While the linkage and size-dependent 
      penetrance of the SCA8 CTG.CAG expansion in the MN-A family argue that the SCA8 
      expansion causes ataxia, the reduced penetrance in other SCA8 families and the 
      discovery of expansions in the general population have led to a controversy 
      surrounding whether or not the SCA8 expansion is pathogenic. A recently reported 
      mouse model in which SCA8 BAC-expansion but not BAC-control lines develop a 
      progressive neurological phenotype now demonstrates the pathogenicity of the 
      (CTG.CAG)(n) expansion. These mice show a loss of cerebellar GABAergic inhibition 
      and, similar to human patients, have 1C2-positive intranuclear inclusions in 
      Purkinje cells and other neurons. Additional studies demonstrate that the SCA8 
      expansion is expressed in both directions (CUG and CAG) and that a novel gene 
      expressed in the CAG direction encodes a pure polyglutamine expansion protein 
      (ataxin 8, ATXN8). Moreover, the expression of non-coding (CUG)(n) expansion 
      transcripts (ataxin 8 opposite strand, ATXN8OS) and the discovery of intranuclear 
      polyglutamine inclusions suggest SCA8 pathogenesis may involve toxic 
      gain-of-function mechanisms at both the protein and RNA levels. Our data, 
      combined with the recently reported antisense transcripts spanning the DM1 repeat 
      expansion in the CAG direction and the growing number of reports of antisense 
      transcripts expressed throughout the mammalian genome, raises the possibility 
      that bidirectional expression across pathogenic microsatellite expansions may 
      occur in other expansion disorders, and that potential pathogenic effects of 
      mutations expressed from both strands should be considered.

PG  - 101-5

AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of autosomal 
      dominantly inherited progressive ataxia diseases. Up to now, almost 30 different 
      gene loci have been found. In 14 of them, the underlying mutations have been 
      identified. The more common SCAs, SCA1, 2, 3 and 6 are due to translated CAG 
      repeat expansions that code for an elongated polyglutamine tract within the 
      respective proteins. These diseases belong to a larger group of polyglutamine 
      disorders that also includes Huntington's disease. Epidemiological studies 
      conducted in different European regions found prevalence rates of SCAs ranging 
      from 0.9 to 3.0:100,000. In all SCAs, ataxia is the prominent symptom. However, 
      the majority have a complex phenotype in which ataxia is accompanied by varying 
      non-ataxia symptoms. In all ataxia patients with proven or suspected autosomal 
      dominant mode of inheritance, the available molecular genetic tests for SCA 
      mutations should be performed. Depending on the geographical origin of the 
      family, these tests will lead to positive diagnostic results in at least half of 
      the families.

TI  - Muscle excitability abnormalities in Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 525-9
LID - 10.1001/archneur.65.4.525 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the frequency of and to characterize muscle excitability 
      abnormalities in Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). DESIGN: Machado-Joseph disease is 
      a common autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia caused by an unstable CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion. Muscle cramps and fasciculations are frequent and 
      sometimes disabling manifestations. However, their frequency and 
      pathophysiological mechanisms remain largely unknown. Symptomatic patients with 
      MJD (hereinafter MJD patients) with molecular confirmation were assessed 
      prospectively. A standard questionnaire addressing clinical features of muscle 
      cramps and fasciculations was used. The Cramps Disability Scale was used to 
      quantify cramps-related disability. Patients underwent neurophysiological testing 
      with routine techniques. F waves of the right median nerves were obtained, and 
      persistence indexes were calculated. Four muscles (deltoid, first dorsal 
      interossei, tibialis anterior, and vastus lateralis) were examined by needle 
      electromyography. A semiquantitative scale (from 0 [no activity] to 4 [continuous 
      activity]) was used to determine the frequency of rest fasciculations in each 
      muscle. RESULTS: Fifty MJD patients (29 men) were included in the study. Their 
      mean age at examination was 46.3 years, their mean age at onset of the disease 
      was 35 years, and the mean duration of disease was 11.2 years. Abnormal CAG(n) 
      varied from 59 to 75 repeats. Forty-one patients presented with muscle cramps; in 
      10, this was their first symptom. The frequency of cramps varied between 1 and 90 
      episodes a week. For 15 patients, cramps were the chief complaint, frequently 
      disturbing sleep or work (Cramps Disability Scale score, 2 or 3). Lower limbs 
      were affected in 37 individuals, but unusual regions, such as the face and 
      abdominal muscles, were also involved. Fasciculations were found in 25 
      individuals; in 8 patients, they included facial muscles. However, fasciculations 
      were not a significant complaint for any of these patients. The clinical and 
      neurophysiological profile of MJD patients with and without cramps was not 
      significantly different. However, MJD patients with fasciculations had more 
      severe damage to their peripheral nerves. CONCLUSIONS: Muscle excitability 
      abnormalities were found in 41 MJD patients (82%), and they were the presenting 
      complaint in 10 (20%). They are related to altered excitability of peripheral 
      motor axons, but mechanisms underlying cramps and fasciculations are possibly 
      distinct in MJD patients.

TI  - Striatal and nigral pathology in a lentiviral rat model of Machado-Joseph 
      disease.
PG  - 2071-83
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddn106 [doi]
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is a fatal, dominant neurodegenerative disorder. MJD 
      results from polyglutamine repeat expansion in the MJD-1 gene, conferring a toxic 
      gain of function to the ataxin-3 protein. In this study, we aimed at 
      overexpressing ataxin-3 in the rat brain using lentiviral vectors (LV), to 
      generate an in vivo MJD genetic model and, to study the disorder in defined brain 
      regions: substantia nigra, an area affected in MJD, cortex and striatum, regions 
      not previously reported to be affected in MJD. LV encoding mutant or wild-type 
      human ataxin-3 was injected in the brain of adult rats and the animals were 
      tested for behavioral deficits and neuropathological abnormalities. Striatal 
      pathology was confirmed in transgenic mice and human tissue. In substantia nigra, 
      unilateral overexpression of mutant ataxin-3 led to: apomorphine-induced turning 
      behavior; formation of ubiquitinated ataxin-3 aggregates; alpha-synuclein 
      immunoreactivity; and loss of dopaminergic markers (TH and VMAT2). No 
      neuropathological changes were observed upon wild-type ataxin-3 overexpression. 
      Mutant ataxin-3 expression in striatum and cortex, resulted in accumulation of 
      misfolded ataxin-3, and within striatum, loss of neuronal markers. Striatal 
      pathology was confirmed by observation in MJD transgenic mice of ataxin-3 
      aggregates and substantial reduction of DARPP-32 immunoreactivity and, in human 
      striata, by ataxin-3 inclusions, immunoreactive for ubiquitin and 
      alpha-synuclein. This study demonstrates the use of LV encoding mutant ataxin-3 
      to produce a model of MJD and brings evidence of striatal pathology, suggesting 
      that this region may contribute to dystonia and chorea observed in some MJD 
      patients and may represent a target for therapies.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) in an Egyptian family presenting with 
      polyphagia and marked CAG expansion in infancy.
PG  - 413-9

AB  - We describe an Egyptian family having SCA2 affecting three generations with 
      marked molecular and clinical anticipation observed in the index case. Our 
      proband was a male child starting as early as 2 years old with progressive 
      extrapyramidal manifestations, slow eye movements and cognitive impairment. A 
      history of nonspecific mild developmental delay was recorded. The patient lost 
      all cognitive functions, had persistent dystonic posture, trophic changes, 
      vasomotor instability, dysphagia and died at the age of 7 years. The age at 
      presentation among other affected family members varied between 11 and 45 years 
      old across three generations. The early common neurological symptoms were 
      choreoathetotic movements, myoclonic jerk, gait difficulty, expressionless face 
      and emotional liability. Later, overt ataxia, incoordination, dysarthria, mild 
      dementia and slow eye saccades predominated. Brisk tendon reflexes were detected 
      in three cases. Peripheral nerve affection was a late manifestation. 
      Interestingly, polyphagia and obesity were striking manifestations in the middle 
      stage of the disease; an observation that might support a previously suggested 
      relation between the ataxin-2 gene and body weight. The proband showed an 
      amplified allele with marked CAG expansion in the form of a smear sized 69-75 
      repeats resulted from maternal transmission. To our knowledge, our index case is 
      the second report in the literature presenting with infantile onset SCA2 and 
      intermediate repeat expansion. This family expands the phenotypic spectrum of 
      early onset SCA2 and points out the importance of considering SCA2 gene analysis 
      in children with progressive neurological impairment and abnormal movements with 
      or without polyphagia.

TI  - Pathogenic expansions of the SCA6 locus are associated with a common CACNA1A 
      haplotype across the globe: founder effect or predisposing chromosome?
PG  - 841-7
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2008.20 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a common cause of dominantly inherited 
      ataxia due to an expansion of the CAG repeat in the CACNA1A gene. Affected 
      individuals from the same population share a common haplotype, raising the 
      possibility that most SCA6 cases have descended from a small number of common 
      founders across the globe. To test this hypothesis, we carried out haplotype 
      analysis on SCA6 families from Europe, South America and the Far East, including 
      an established de novo SCA6 expansion. A core CACNA1A disease haplotype was found 
      in affected individuals across the globe. This was also present in the unaffected 
      father of the de novo case, suggesting that the shared chromosome predisposes to 
      the CAG repeat expansion at the SCA6 locus. The SCA6 expansion lies within a CpG 
      island, which could act as a cis-acting element predisposing to repeat expansion 
      as for other CAG/CTG repeat diseases. Polymorphic variation in this region may 
      explain the high-risk haplotype found in SCA6 families.

PG  - 201-7
LID - 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2007.10.020 [doi]
AB  - The sequencing procedure has been used to determine the size of the CAG repeat 
      expansion for the diagnosis of genetic disorders. Likewise, standard polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) and gel electrophoresis techniques are applied for screening 
      large number of patients. The trinucleotide repeats (TNR) region amplification by 
      means of the PCR procedure was initially performed using 32-P end-labelled 
      primers and currently carried out with fluorescently end-labelled primers. The 
      goal to obtain reliable TNR quantification assays, at low cost and short assay 
      times, represents a challenge for the molecular diagnosis aimed at massive 
      screening of affected populations. In the current work, we obtained preliminary 
      results of a new methodology for the detection and size estimation of CAG 
      expanded alleles. The assay was based on an indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent 
      assay (ELISA) for quantifying the amount of labelled cytidines in DNA molecules. 
      The label, 6-(p-bromobenzamido)caproyl radical, was introduced by the 
      transamination and acylation reactions. A group of model sequences containing 
      different numbers of CAG repeats, as well as the ATXN3 (ataxin 3) gene (from 
      subjects suffering type 3 spinocerebellar ataxia SCA3) were used for assay 
      standardization. The assay is simple, inexpensive, and easy to perform and 
      differentiates distinct degrees of CAG expansions.

TI  - Dnmt1 deficiency promotes CAG repeat expansion in the mouse germline.
PG  - 1306-17
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddn019 [doi]
AB  - Expanded CAG repeat tracts are the cause of at least a dozen neurodegenerative 
      disorders. In humans, long CAG repeats tend to expand during transmissions from 
      parent to offspring, leading to an earlier age of disease onset and more severe 
      symptoms in subsequent generations. Here, we show that the maintenance DNA 
      methyltransferase Dnmt1, which preserves the patterns of CpG methylation, plays a 
      key role in CAG repeat instability in human cells and in the male and female 
      mouse germlines. SiRNA knockdown of Dnmt1 in human cells destabilized CAG triplet 
      repeats, and Dnmt1 deficiency in mice promoted intergenerational expansion of CAG 
      repeats at the murine spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (Sca1) locus. Importantly, 
      Dnmt1(+/-) SCA1 mice, unlike their Dnmt1(+/+) SCA1 counterparts, closely 
      reproduced the intergenerational instability patterns observed in human SCA1 
      patients. In addition, we found aberrant DNA and histone methylation at sites 
      within the CpG island that abuts the expanded repeat tract in Dnmt1-deficient 
      mice. These studies suggest that local chromatin structure may play a role in 
      triplet repeat instability. These results are consistent with normal epigenetic 
      changes during germline development contributing to intergenerational instability 
      of CAG repeats in mice and in humans.

TI  - Molecular analysis of CAG repeats at five different spinocerebellar ataxia loci: 
      correlation and alternative explanations for disease pathogenesis.
PG  - 338-42
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are caused by expansion of (CAG)n triplet repeats. 
      These repeats occur as polymorphic forms in general population; however, beyond a 
      threshold size they become pathogenic. The sizes and distributions of repeats at 
      the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA7 and DRPLA loci were assessed by molecular analysis of 
      124 unrelated ataxia patients and 44 controls, and the association of larger 
      normal (LN) alleles with disease prevalence was evaluated. Triplet repeat 
      expansions in the disease range were detected in 8% (10/124) of the cases, with 
      the majority having expansion at the SCA1 locus. Normal allele ranges in the 
      cohort studied were similar to the Caucasian and North Indian populations but 
      differed from the Korean and Japanese populations at various loci. The percentage 
      of individuals with LN alleles at the SCA1 and SCA2 loci was higher than reported 
      in Indians, Japanese and Caucasians. LN alleles showed a good correlation with 
      the incidence of SCA1, indicating that SCA1 is the most prevalent ataxia in our 
      population. The majority of cases with clinical symptoms of SCA could not be 
      diagnosed by established CAG repeat criteria, suggesting that there may be an 
      alternative basis for disease pathogenesis: (i) Repeats lower than the normal 
      range may also result in abnormal phenotypes (ii) LN alleles at different loci in 
      the same individual may contribute to symptoms (iii) Exogenous factors may play a 
      role in triggering disease symptoms in individuals with LN alleles (iv) Triplet 
      repeats may reach the disease range in the brain but not in the blood.

TI  - Impact of the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene premutation on 
      neuropsychiatric functioning in adult males without fragile X-associated 
      Tremor/Ataxia syndrome: a controlled study.
PG  - 859-72
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.30685 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X Syndrome is the most common heritable form of mental retardation caused 
      by silencing of the FMR1 gene, which arises from intergenerational trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion leading to full mutation. An intermediary carrier condition, 
      known as the premutation, is characterized by expansion up to 200 repeats without 
      concomitant gene silencing. This prevalent allelic variant was initially thought 
      to be free of phenotypic effects. However, recent reports have identified a 
      degenerative disease, Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) in 
      older men as well as premature ovarian failure in women. Previously reports are 
      inconsistent regarding the neuropsychiatric phenotype associated with premutation 
      due to small sample sizes, ascertainment bias, lack of adequate control groups, 
      administration of measures with poor psychometric properties, and the confounding 
      effects of FXTAS. We addressed these problems by conducting a controlled study of 
      male carriers (n = 40) of the premutation without manifest symptoms of FXTAS, 
      comparing their responses on specific, reliable, and valid measures of 
      neuropsychiatric functioning to those of individuals with shared family 
      environment (n = 22) and non-carrier comparison males (n = 43). Multivariate 
      analyses revealed that the premutation confers significant risk for working 
      memory difficulties, an associated feature of Attention-Deficit Disorder. 
      Furthermore, both the family controls and men with premutation exhibited higher

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 in Scotland: frequency, neurological, 
      neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric findings.
PG  - 41-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to: (i) establish whether the 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA 8) expansion is associated with ataxia in 
      Scotland; (ii) test the hypothesis that SCA 8 is associated with 
      neuropsychological impairment; and (iii) review neuroradiological findings in SCA 
      8. METHODS: The methods included: (i) measurement of SCA 8 expansion frequencies 
      in ataxic patients and healthy controls; (ii) comprehensive neuropsychological 
      assessment of patients with SCA 8 and matched controls, neuropsychiatric 
      interview; and (iii) comparison of patient and matched control magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) scans. RESULTS: (i) 10/694 (1.4%) unrelated individuals with ataxia 
      had combined CTA/CTG repeat expansions >100 compared to 1/1190 (0.08%) healthy 
      controls (P < 0.0005); (ii) neuropsychological assessment revealed a dysexecutive 
      syndrome among SCA 8 patients, not readily explained by motor or mood 
      disturbance; neuropsychiatric symptoms occurred commonly; (iii) cerebellar 
      atrophy was the only salient MRI abnormality in the patient group. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The SCA 8 expansion is associated with ataxia in Scotland. The disorder is 
      associated with a dysexecutive syndrome.

TI  - Prolonged cortical silent period but normal sensorimotor plasticity in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 6.
PG  - 378-85
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 6 (SCA6) is a hereditary disease characterized by a 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the CACNA1A gene and late-onset bilateral 
      cerebellar atrophy. It is unclear if there is significant pathology outside of 
      the cerebellum. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation to assess sensorimotor 
      cortical circuits and cortical plasticity in 8 SCA6 patients and 8 age-matched 
      controls. Behavioral performance was assessed using a rhythmic tapping task. 
      Neurophysiological measures of SCA6 patients showed a prolonged cortical silent 
      period (CSP) but normal MEP recruitment curve, short-latency afferent inhibition, 
      long-latency afferent inhibition and ipsilateral silent period. 
      Paired-associative stimulation induction also increased motor-evoked potentials 
      normally. SCA6 patients had greater variability with cued rhythmic tapping than 
      normals and deteriorated when the cue was removed; in comparison, normal subjects 
      had similar variability between cued and uncued rhythmic tapping. Analysis using 
      a Wing-Kristofferson timing model indicated that both clock variance and motor 
      delay variance were abnormal. Conclusion. In SCA6, the circuits for sensorimotor 
      integration and the mechanisms for LTP-like plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex 
      are unimpaired. A prolonged CSP in SCA6 just like in other cerebellar atrophies 
      would suggest that this neurophysiological change typifies cerebellar 
      dysfunction.

TI  - Chronic pain in Machado-Joseph disease: a frequent and disabling symptom.
PG  - 1767-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is one of the most common forms of 
      neurodegenerative ataxia characterized by remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity. 
      Although patients frequently report pain, systematic evaluation of this clinical 
      feature is lacking. OBJECTIVES: To compare the frequency of chronic pain among 
      patients with genetically confirmed MJD, an age- and sex-matched healthy control 
      group, and a disease control group of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (ALS). METHODS: We included 70 patients with MJD, 20 patients with ALS, and 70 
      control subjects from 2 clinical centers. All individuals underwent assessment 
      with a standardized pain questionnaire. In addition, we used a visual analog 
      scale to quantify pain intensity. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients with MJD (47%), 
      3 patients with ALS (15%), and 6 controls (9%) reported chronic pain. Lower back 
      pain preceded ataxia in 6 patients with MJD. Twenty-nine patients with MJD had 
      daily pain, which was continuous in 23. The mean visual analog scale score was 
      6.1 in patients with MJD. Pain was musculoskeletal in 26 patients with MJD, 
      dystonic in 2, neuropathic in 2, and mixed in 3. Typically, pain was lumbar (n = 
      17) or in the lower limbs (n = 15). We did not find significant differences 
      regarding duration of disease, sex, or severity of ataxia among patients with MJD 
      with and without chronic pain. Expanded (CAG)(n) tandem repeats were longer in 
      patients with MJD who experienced chronic pain (67.3 vs 65.2; P = .04). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In our series, pain was significantly more frequent in patients with 
      MJD than in controls. Chronic pain was a frequent and often disabling complaint 
      among patients with MJD. The lower back was the most frequently reported location 
      of pain in patients with MJD.

TI  - Instability of expanded CAG/CAA repeats in spinocerebellar ataxia type 17.
PG  - 215-22
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansions are dynamic mutations causing many neurological 
      disorders, and their instability is influenced by multiple factors. Repeat 
      configuration seems particularly important, and pure repeats are thought to be 
      more unstable than interrupted repeats. But direct evidence is still lacking. 
      Here, we presented strong support for this hypothesis from our studies on 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17). SCA17 is a typical polyglutamine disease 
      caused by CAG repeat expansion in TBP (TATA binding protein), and is unique in 
      that the pure expanded polyglutamine tract is coded by either a simple 
      configuration with long stretches of pure CAGs or a complex configuration 
      containing CAA interruptions. By small pool PCR (SP-PCR) analysis of blood DNA 
      from SCA17 patients of distinct racial backgrounds, we quantitatively assessed 
      the instability of these two types of expanded alleles coding similar length of 
      polyglutamine expansion. Mutation frequency in patients harboring pure CAG 
      repeats is 2-3 folds of those with CAA interruptions. Interestingly, the pure CAG 
      repeats showed both expansion and deletion while the interrupted repeats 
      exhibited mostly deletion at a significantly lower frequency. These data strongly 
      suggest that repeat configuration is a critical determinant for instability, and 
      CAA interruptions might serve as a limiting element for further expansion of CAG 
      repeats in SCA17 locus, suggesting a molecular basis for lack of anticipation in 
      SCA17 families with interrupted CAG expansion.

TI  - Case control analysis of repeat expansion size in ataxia.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurological diseases. The expansion of unstable microsatellite 
      repeats has been identified as the underlying pathogenic cause of 10 subtypes of 
      autosomal dominant SCAs. The aetiology of sporadic SCA is unknown. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effect of large normal repeats in patients 
      presenting with sporadic or familial ataxia compared to a control population. The 
      size of the expansion was determined using a fluorescent PCR approach in 10 
      common SCA genes: SCA-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 (CACNA1A), 
      SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), SCA-17 (TBP) 
      and DRPLA (ATN1), in 165 ataxia patients and 307 controls of Welsh origin. There 
      was no difference between cases and controls in the distribution of the large 
      normal alleles, or in the distribution of the combined CAG repeats. The normal 
      allele distribution in the Welsh population was largely similar to that of other 
      Caucasian populations. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of large normal 
      repeats on the susceptibility to develop ataxia.

TI  - Cis-acting factors promoting the CAG intergenerational instability in 
      Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 439-46
AB  - In repeat expansion disorders, the size of pathological alleles is the most 
      relevant factor accounting for the disease severity and age-at-onset, emphasizing 
      the clinical significance of their underlying intergenerational instability. In 
      one of these diseases, Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), the sex of transmitting 
      progenitor and the C(987)GG/G(987)GG polymorphism are the best studied factors 
      acting on intergenerational instability of expanded alleles. Here, we assessed 
      the influence of other cis and inter-allelic acting factors, at the ATXN3 locus, 
      through the analysis of MJD lineages, flanking STR-based haplotypes, the initial 
      repeat size and parental age. A total of 100 transmissions of the expanded MJD 
      allele were analyzed according to the sex of the transmitting parent. We have 
      shown that independent origin mutations (identified by intragenic SNP-based 
      haplotypes) behave differently, as the status of instability (contraction, no 
      change or further expansion) is concerned. Indeed, 72% of expansions were 
      associated to the worldwide spread TTACAC lineage, whereas the GTGGCA displayed 
      75% of all contractions observed. The analysis of flanking recombinant haplotypes 
      did not suggest any further distant cis elements acting up- or downstream the 
      ATXN3 locus. Considering the increased amplitude of expansions seen in older 
      transmitting fathers, a repair-based mechanism may be suggested for the meiotic 
      instability at this locus; furthermore, the lack of correlation between the 
      initial repeat size and degree of instability did not support a replication-based 
      mechanism. In summary, our findings point to different mechanisms of instability 
      underlying male and female meioses, as well as contraction and expansion 
      processes in MJD.

TI  - Asian origin for the worldwide-spread mutational event in Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 1502-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Machado-Joseph disease is the most frequent dominant ataxia 
      worldwide. Despite its frequency and presence in many populations, only 2 founder 
      mutations have been suggested to explain its current geographic distribution. 
      OBJECTIVES: To trace back in history the main mutational events in Machado-Joseph 
      disease, we aimed to assess ancestral haplotypes and population backgrounds, to 
      date the mutations, and to trace the routes and time of introduction of the 
      founder haplotypes in different populations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      We studied 264 families with Machado-Joseph disease from 20 different 
      populations. Six intragenic single-nucleotide polymorphisms were used to 
      determine ancestral mutational events; 4 flanking short tandem repeats were used 
      to construct extended haplotypes and measure accumulation of genetic diversity 
      over time within each lineage. RESULTS: The worldwide-spread lineage, TTACAC, had 
      its highest diversity in the Japanese population, where we identified the 
      ancestral short tandem repeat-based haplotype. Accumulated variability suggested 
      a postneolithic mutation, about 5774 +/- 1116 years old, with more recent 
      introductions in North America, Germany, France, Portugal, and Brazil. As to the 
      second mutational event, in the GTGGCA lineage, only 7 families (of 71 families) 
      did not have Portuguese ancestry, although gene diversity was again smaller in 
      Portuguese families (0.44) than in non-Portuguese families (0.93). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The worldwide-spread mutation may have first occurred in Asia and later been 
      diffused throughout Europe, with a founder effect accounting for its high 
      prevalence in Portugal; the other Machado-Joseph disease lineage is more recent, 
      about 1416 +/- 434 years old, and its dispersion may be explained mainly by 
      recent Portuguese emigration.

TI  - Genetic analysis of SCA 2 and 3 repeat expansions in essential tremor and 
      atypical Parkinsonism.
PG  - 1971-4
AB  - Anecdotal reports suggest that patients with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA 2) 
      patients can present with postural tremor with ataxia. We determined the 
      prevalence of SCA2 and SCA3 mutations in a cohort of ET and atypical Parkinsonism 
      patients. A total of 277 subjects comprising of 177 ET and 100 atypical 
      Parkinsonism were examined. We identified one positive case of SCA3 among those 
      who were diagnosed with ET, yielding a prevalence of 0.5%, but a zero prevalence 
      among our atypical Parkinsonism patients. No study subjects carried an abnormal 
      SCA2 repeat expansion. Our study highlights that SCA3 can present initially with 
      ET symptoms, expanding the spectrum of genetic diseases that can be associated 
      with ET-like phenotype. Routine screening for SCA2 and SCA3 in ET and atypical 
      Parkinsonism patients may not be cost effective. However, in the long-term 
      follow-up of patients who present with an ET phenotype, clinicians should be 
      vigilant for other neurological signs, which may be point to an alternate 
      diagnosis.

TI  - Mitochondrial complex I gene variant associated with early age at onset in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2.
PG  - 1042-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: A common mitochondrial complex I gene polymorphism (10398G) is 
      reported to be inversely associated with the risk of Parkinson disease. We 
      hypothesized that this variant might have a protective effect on the central 
      nervous system and therefore might delay the onset of symptoms in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 2 (SCA2). OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of the 10398G 
      polymorphism with age at onset in Cuban patients with SCA2. DESIGN: Genetic 
      association study. SETTING: Holguin, Cuba. PATIENTS: Forty-six Cuban patients 
      with SCA2. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence or absence of the 10398G polymorphism 
      was determined in 46 Cuban patients with SCA2 and early or late onset of 
      symptoms, defined as at least 2 SDs lower than or higher than the mean age at 
      onset for patients with a similarly sized triplet repeat expansion. RESULTS: The 
      polymorphism was present in 11 of 27 Cuban patients with SCA2 and early onset 
      (41%) vs 2 of 19 with late onset (11%) (Fisher exact test; P = .04). CONCLUSION: 
      Contrary to our prediction of a later onset of SCA2 in patients with the 10398G 
      polymorphism, we find that this variant is associated with an earlier age at 
      onset in Cuban patients with SCA2.

TI  - CAG-encoded polyglutamine length polymorphism in the human genome.
PG  - 126
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expansion of polyglutamine-encoding CAG trinucleotide repeats has 
      been identified as the pathogenic mutation in nine different genes associated 
      with neurodegenerative disorders. The majority of individuals clinically 
      diagnosed with spinocerebellar ataxia do not have mutations within known disease 
      genes, and it is likely that additional ataxias or Huntington disease-like 
      disorders will be found to be caused by this common mutational mechanism. We set 
      out to determine the length distributions of CAG-polyglutamine tracts for the 
      entire human genome in a set of healthy individuals in order to characterize the 
      nature of polyglutamine repeat length variation across the human genome, to 
      establish the background against which pathogenic repeat expansions can be 
      detected, and to prioritize candidate genes for repeat expansion disorders. 
      RESULTS: We found that repeats, including those in known disease genes, have 
      unique distributions of glutamine tract lengths, as measured by fragment analysis 
      of PCR-amplified repeat regions. This emphasizes the need to characterize each 
      distribution and avoid making generalizations between loci. The best predictors 
      of known disease genes were occurrence of a long CAG-tract uninterrupted by CAA 
      codons in their reference genome sequence, and high glutamine tract length 
      variance in the normal population. We used these parameters to identify eight 
      priority candidate genes for polyglutamine expansion disorders. Twelve 
      CAG-polyglutamine repeats were invariant and these can likely be excluded as 
      candidates. We outline some confusion in the literature about this type of data, 
      difficulties in comparing such data between publications, and its application to 
      studies of disease prevalence in different populations. Analysis of Gene 
      Ontology-based functions of CAG-polyglutamine-containing genes provided a visual 
      framework for interpretation of these genes' functions. All nine known disease 
      genes were involved in DNA-dependent regulation of transcription or in 
      neurogenesis, as were all of the well-characterized priority candidate genes. 
      CONCLUSION: This publication makes freely available the normal distributions of 
      CAG-polyglutamine repeats in the human genome. Using these background 
      distributions, against which pathogenic expansions can be identified, we have 
      begun screening for mutations in individuals clinically diagnosed with novel 
      forms of spinocerebellar ataxia or Huntington disease-like disorders who do not 
      have identified mutations within the known disease-associated genes.

TI  - Multiplex families with multiple system atrophy.
PG  - 545-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) has been considered a sporadic disease, 
      without patterns of inheritance. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of 
      4 multiplex families with MSA, including clinical genetic aspects. DESIGN: 
      Clinical and genetic study. SETTING: Four departments of neurology in Japan. 
      Patients Eight patients in 4 families with parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and 
      autonomic failure with age at onset ranging from 58 to 72 years. Two siblings in 
      each family were affected with these conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical 
      evaluation was performed according to criteria by Gilman et al. Trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the responsible genes for the spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 
      series and for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) was evaluated by 
      polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequence analysis of coding regions in the 
      alpha-synuclein gene was performed. RESULTS: Consanguineous marriage was observed 
      in 1 of 4 families. Among 8 patients, 1 had definite MSA, 5 had probable MSA, and 
      2 had possible MSA. The most frequent phenotype was MSA with predominant 
      parkinsonism, observed in 5 patients. Six patients showed pontine atrophy with 
      cross sign or slitlike signal change at the posterolateral putaminal margin or 
      both on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Possibilities of hereditary ataxias, 
      including SCA1 (ataxin 1, ATXN1), SCA2 (ATXN2), Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3 
      (ATXN1), SCA6 (ATXN1), SCA7 (ATXN7), SCA12 (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory 
      subunit B, beta isoform; PP2R2B), SCA17 (TATA box binding protein, TBP) and DRPLA 
      (atrophin 1; ATN1), were excluded, and no mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene 
      were found. CONCLUSIONS: Findings in these multiplex families suggest the 
      presence of familial MSA with autosomal recessive inheritance and a genetic 
      predisposition to MSA. Molecular genetic approaches focusing on familial MSA are 
      expected to provide clues to the pathogenesis of MSA.

TI  - Impairment of executive cognitive functioning in males with fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome.
PG  - 645-50
AB  - The fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a recently identified 
      phenotype associated with trinucleotide repeat expansions in the premutation 
      range of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. In addition to 
      progressive gait ataxia, action tremor, peripheral neuropathy, and parkinsonism, 
      FXTAS involves impaired cognition. Our preliminary research suggests that 
      executive cognitive functioning (ECF) is especially affected. In this study, a 
      brief neuropsychological exam was administered to 33 men with FXTAS and 27 
      healthy controls. Compared with controls, individuals with FXTAS showed 
      statistically significant impairments on measures from the Wechsler Adult 
      Intelligence Scale, third edition (WAIS-III; verbal IQ, performance [nonverbal] 
      IQ, verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, and processing speed). FXTAS 
      subjects scored significantly lower on three of four measures of ECF and on two 
      tests of information processing speed. The results provide evidence that FXTAS 
      involves impairment of general intellectual functioning, with marked impairment 
      of executive cognitive abilities. The pattern of cognitive performance is 
      somewhat similar to that observed in the frontal variant of frontotemporal 
      dementia and several of the spinocerebellar ataxias, but differs from the 
      deficits observed in dementia of the Alzheimer type.

TI  - Repeat expansion in spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 alleles of the TATA-box 
      binding protein gene: an evolutionary approach.
PG  - 81-7
AB  - The variability and mutational changes of the CAG microsatellite in the TATA-box 
      binding protein gene (TBP) were studied. We sequenced the microsatellite of the 
      TBP gene of 25 unrelated individuals from northern Germany (10 SCA17 patients and 
      15 unaffected control individuals). In addition, the microsatellites were 
      sequenced from individuals of 10 northern German families with at least one 
      family member affected by SCA17. To study also the evolutionary history of this 
      CAG/CAA microsatellite in nonhuman primates, the homologous regions were analysed 
      from Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus, P. abellii, Hylobates lar, 
      Nomascus leucogenys, Symphalangus syndactylus, Macaca mulatta, Papio hamadryas, 
      Colobus polykomos and Callithrix jacchus. Three major conclusions were drawn: (i) 
      Patterns of synonymous CAA interruptions in the microsatellite are characteristic 
      and likely to result from selection for stabilizing the repetitive region; (ii) 
      Interspecific comparisons indicate that SCA17 is likely to be a human trait. The 
      most common allele in humans (37 repeats) is close to the threshold value upon 
      which neurodegenerative changes can occur and may act as a repository for 
      expanded, pathogenic alleles; (iii) The cassette-like structure of five out of 17 
      expanded alleles can be attributed to unequal crossing over. This can explain the 
      rare and sporadic de novo generation of SCA17 alleles.

TI  - Cambodian founder effect for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (Machado-Joseph 
      disease).
PG  - 110-3
AB  - Four families from the same region of Cambodia immigrated to the Pacific 
      Northwest of the United States. All four families have been discovered to have 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA 3; Machado-Joseph disease) with a similar 
      clinical phenotype. CAG repeat expansions in the ATXN3 gene range from 72 to 77. 
      Mean age of onset has varied from 19 to 44 years and mean age at death of 4 
      individuals has been 60 years. The prevalence of the various subtypes of SCA 
      varies worldwide from country to country. Neurologists should be alert to the 
      possibility of SCA 3 in Cambodian patients with unexplained cerebellar ataxia.

TI  - Targeted deletion of a single Sca8 ataxia locus allele in mice causes abnormal 
      gait, progressive loss of motor coordination, and Purkinje cell dendritic 
      deficits.
PG  - 9975-82
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) patients typically have a slowly 
      progressive, adult-onset ataxia. SCA8 is dominantly inherited and is caused by 
      large CTG repeat expansions in the untranslated antisense RNA of the Kelch-like 1 
      gene (KLHL1), but the molecular mechanism through which this expansion leads to 
      disease is still unknown. To more fully characterize the underlying molecular 
      mechanisms involved in SCA8, we developed a mouse model in which Klhl1 is deleted 
      in either all tissues or is deleted specifically in Purkinje cells only. We found 
      that mice that are either homozygous or heterozygous for the Klhl1 deletion have 
      significant gait abnormalities at an early age and develop a significant loss of 
      motor coordination by 24 weeks of age. This loss progresses more rapidly in 
      homozygous knock-outs. Mice with Klhl1 specifically deleted in only Purkinje 
      cells had a loss of motor coordination that was almost identical to the 
      total-tissue deletion mice. Finally, we found significant Purkinje cell dendritic 
      deficits, as measured by the thickness of the molecular layer, in all mice in 
      which Klhl1 was deleted (both total and Purkinje cell-specific deletions) and an 
      intermediate reduction in molecular layer thickness in mice with reduced levels 
      of Klhl1 expression (heterozygous deletions). The results from this mouse model 
      show that even a partial loss of Klhl1 function leads to degeneration of Purkinje 
      cell function and indicates that loss of KLHL1 activity is likely to play a 
      significant part in the underlying pathophysiology of SCA8.

TI  - The role of ataxin 10 in the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 10.
PG  - 607-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal dominant 
      disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia and seizures. SCA10 is caused by an 
      expansion of an ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat in intron 9 of the ataxin 10 
      (ATXN10) gene encoding an approximately 55-kd protein of unknown function. 
      However, how this mutation leads to SCA10 is unknown. METHODS: In an effort to 
      understand the pathogenic mechanism of SCA10, the authors conducted a series of 
      experiments to address the effect of repeat expansion on the transcription and 
      RNA processing of the ATXN10 gene. In addition, we generated Sca10 (mouse ataxin 
      10 homolog)-null mice and addressed the role of Sca10 gene dosage on the 
      cerebellum. RESULTS: Mutant ATXN10 allele is transcribed at the normal level, and 
      the pre-mRNA containing an expanded repeat is processed normally in 
      patient-derived cells. Sca10-null mice exhibited embryonic lethality. 
      Heterozygous mutants were overtly normal and did not develop SCA10 phenotype 
      CONCLUSION: A simple gain of function or loss of function of ATXN10 is unlikely 
      to be the major pathogenic mechanism contributing to the spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 10 phenotype.

TI  - A novel trinucleotide repeat expansion at chromosome 3q26.2 identified by a 
      CAG/CTG repeat expansion detection array.
PG  - 193-200
AB  - CAG/CTG repeat expansions cause at least 12 different neurological disorders, and 
      additional disorders of this type probably exist. Using the repeat expansion 
      detection (RED) assay, we identified an expanded CAG/CTG repeat in a 50-year-old 
      woman with an autosomal dominant syndrome with prominent progressive sensory 
      neuropathy. The expansion could not be accounted for by any of the CAG/CTG 
      repeats known to undergo expansion. To identify the locus of the expansion, we 
      created a PCR array to assess the repeat length of all repeats of eight or more 
      CAG or CTG triplets in the human genome. The expansion was localized to a repeat 
      contained in an intron of a Genscan-predicted gene, 185 nt downstream of a 
      predicted exon that is conserved through mouse. The closest experimentally 
      verified gene in the region (TNIK, encoding a serine/threonine kinase) occurs 
      approximately 63 Kb downstream from the repeat. The length of the expansion in 
      the proband is 98 triplets. This repeat is not expanded in the proband's cousin 
      (the only other affected family member for whom DNA is currently available) and 
      no expansions were detected in a set of 230 patients with movement disorders of 
      unknown cause. An expanded allele containing 58 triplets was detected in a single 
      control individual, and no other expansions were detected in a set of 255 
      controls. The normal repeat length ranges from 5 to 30 triplets, with 8 triplets 
      the most common allele. Our results suggest that this new repeat expansion is 
      probably not the direct cause of the phenotype in the proband. Whether the repeat 
      contributes to the patient's phenotype, or is associated with another phenotype, 
      remains to be determined.

TI  - A multistep mutation mechanism drives the evolution of the CAG repeat at MJD/SCA3 
      locus.
PG  - 932-40
AB  - Despite the intense debate around the repeat instability reported on the large 
      group of neurological disorders caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions, little 
      is known about the mutation process underlying alleles in the normal range that, 
      ultimately, expand to pathological size. In this study, we assessed the mutation 
      mechanisms by which wild-type Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) alleles have been 
      generated throughout human evolution. Haplotypes including the CAG repeat, six 
      intragenic SNPs and four flanking microsatellites were analysed in 431 normal 
      chromosomes of European, Asian and African origin. A bimodal CAG repeat length 
      frequency distribution was found in the four most frequent wild-type lineages 
      (H1-GCGGCA; H2-GTGGCA; H3-TTAGAC and H4-TTACAC). Based on flanking microsatellite 
      haplotypes, the variance calculated by analysis of molecular variance between 
      modal (CAG)n alleles was little or null in lineages H1, H2 and H4, as were the 
      pairwise differences. Moreover, genetic distances among all the alleles from each 
      lineage did not reflect the allele sizes differences, as expected if a stepwise 
      mutation model was the main process of evolution. On the contrary, when exposed 
      in maximum parsimonious phylogenetic trees, a large number of mutation steps 
      separated same-size alleles, whereas several microsatellite haplotypes were 
      shared by modal CAGs. In conclusion, our results suggest that the main mutation 
      mechanism occurring in the evolution of the polymorphic CAG region at MJD/SCA3 
      locus is a multistep one, either by gene conversion or DNA slippage; repeats with 
      14, 21, 23 and 27 CAGs are the main alleles involved in this process.

TI  - Both normal and polyglutamine- expanded ataxin-7 are components of TFTC-type GCN5 
      histone acetyltransferase- containing complexes.
PG  - 155-63
AB  - SCA7 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 7) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the SCA7 gene that leads to elongation of a polyglutamine 
      tract in ataxin-7, a protein of unknown function. Sgf73, a putative yeast 
      orthologue of ataxin-7, has been identified as a new component of the yeast SAGA 
      (Spt/Ada/Gcn5 acetyltransferase) multisubunit complex, a co-activator required 
      for the transcription of a subset of RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. We show 
      here that ataxin-7 is an integral component of mammalian SAGA-like complexes, 
      i.e. the TFTC [TBP (TATA-binding protein)-free TAF (TBP-associated factor) 
      complex] and the STAGA (SPT3/TAF9/GCN5 acetyltransferase) complex. In agreement 
      with this, immunoprecipitation of ataxin-7 retained a histone acetyltransferase 
      activity characteristic of TFTC-like complexes. Moreover, polyglutamine expansion 
      in ataxin-7 did not affect its incorporation into TFTCs/STAGA complexes purified 
      from cells from a SCA7 patient. We demonstrate here that ataxin-7 is the human 
      orthologue of a the yeast SAGA Sgf73 subunit, and is a bona fide subunit of human 
      TFTC-like transcriptional complexes.

TI  - Large pathogenic expansions in the SCA2 and SCA7 genes can be detected by 
      fluorescent repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction assay.
PG  - 128-32
AB  - Large expansions in the SCA2 and SCA7 genes (>100 CAG repeats) have been 
      associated with juvenile and infantile forms of cerebellar ataxias that cannot be 
      detected using standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Here, we describe a 
      successful application of the fluorescent short tandem repeat-primed PCR method 
      for accurate identification of these expanded repeats. The test is robust, 
      reliable, and inexpensive and can be used to screen large series of patients, 
      although it cannot give a precise evaluation of the size of the expansion. This 
      test may be of practical value in prenatal diagnoses offered to affected or 
      pre-symptomatic at-risk parents, in which a very large expansion inherited from 
      one of the parents can be missed in the fetus by standard PCR.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7): first report of a systematic 
      neuropathological study of the brain of a patient with a very short expanded 
      CAG-repeat.
PG  - 287-95
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) represents a very rare and severe autosomal 
      dominantly inherited cerebellar ataxia (ADCA). It belongs to the group of 
      CAG-repeat or polyglutamine diseases with its underlying molecular genetical 
      defect on chromosome 3p12-p21.1. Here, we performed a systematic study of the 
      neuropathology on unconventional thick serial sections of the first available 
      brain tissue of a genetically confirmed late-onset SCA7 patient with a very short 
      CAG-repeat expansion. Along with myelin pallor of a variety of central nervous 
      fiber tracts, we observed i) neurodegeneration in select areas of the cerebral 
      cortex, and ii) widespread nerve cell loss in the cerebellum, thalamus, nuclei of 
      the basal ganglia, and brainstem. In addition, upon immunocytochemical analysis 
      using the anti-polyglutamine antibody 1C2, immunopositive neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusions bodies (NI) were observed in all cerebellar regions, in all parts of 
      the cerebral cortex, and in telencephalic and brainstem nuclei, irrespective of 
      whether they underwent neurodegeneration. These novel findings provide 
      explanations for a variety of clinical symptoms and paraclinical findings of both 
      our and other SCA7 patients. Finally, our immunocytochemical analysis confirms 
      previous studies which described the presence of NI in obviously degenerated 
      brain and retinal regions as well as in apparently well-preserved brain regions 
      and retina of SCA7 patients.

TI  - Interruptions in the expanded ATTCT repeat of spinocerebellar ataxia type 10: 
      repeat purity as a disease modifier?
PG  - 125-9
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is one of numerous genetic disorders that 
      result from simple repeat expansions. SCA10 is caused by expansion of an intronic 
      ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat tract. It is clinically characterized by progressive 
      ataxia, seizures, and anticipation, which can vary within and between families. 
      We report two SCA10 families showing distinct frequencies of seizures and 
      correlations of repeat length with age at onset. One family displayed 
      uninterrupted ATTCT expansions, whereas the other showed multiple interruptions 
      of the repeat by nonconsensus repeat units, which differed both in the length 
      and/or sequence of the repeat unit. Disease-causing microsatellite expansions 
      have been assumed to be composed of uninterrupted pure repeats. Our findings for 
      SCA10 challenge this convention and suggest that the purity of the expanded 
      repeat element may be a disease modifier.

TI  - Ataxin-7 can export from the nucleus via a conserved exportin-dependent signal.
PG  - 2730-9
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused 
      by a CAG DNA triplet repeat expansion leading to an expanded polyglutamine tract 
      in the ataxin-7 protein. Ataxin-7 appears to be a transcription factor and a 
      component of the STAGA transcription coactivator complex. Here, using live cell 
      imaging and inverted fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we demonstrate 
      that ataxin-7 has the ability to export from the nucleus via the CRM-1/exportin 
      pathway and that ataxin-7 contains a classic leucine-type nuclear export signal 
      (NES). We have precisely defined the location of this NES in ataxin-7 and found 
      it to be fully conserved in all vertebrate species. Polyglutamine expansion was 
      seen to reduce the nuclear export rate of mutant ataxin-7 relative to wild-type 
      ataxin-7. Subtle point mutation of the NES in polyglutamine expanded ataxin-7 
      increased toxicity in primary cerebellar neurons in a polyglutamine 
      length-dependent manner in the context of full-length ataxin-7. Our results add 
      ataxin-7 to a growing list of polyglutamine disease proteins that are capable of 
      nuclear shuttling, and we define an activity of ataxin-7 in the STAGA complex of 
      trafficking between the nucleus and cytoplasm.

TI  - Meiotic CAG repeat instability in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6: maternally 
      transmitted elongation in a presumed sporadic case.
PG  - 95-8
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is an autosomal dominantly inherited 
      disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. The 
      molecular background for the disorder is a CAG repeat expansion in the CACNA1A 
      gene located on chromosome 19. The size of SCA6 expanded alleles is usually 
      stable, and variation in repeat size over successive generations is rare. We 
      report a Danish family with one case of SCA6 resembling a sporadic case of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia. Analysis of the CACNA1A gene showed meiotic CAG repeat 
      instability in the transmission from a 70-year-old woman with no subjective 
      symptoms to her symptomatic son. The CAG repeat size expanded from 22 repeats in 
      the mother to 23 repeats in the proband. This case demonstrates maternal repeat 
      instability and clinical anticipation in a family with SCA6.

TI  - ATM gene founder haplotypes and associated mutations in Polish families with 
      ataxia-telangiectasia.
PG  - 657-64
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an early onset autosomal recessive ataxia 
      associated with characteristic chromosomal aberrations, cell cycle checkpoint 
      defects, cancer susceptibility, and sensitivity to ionizing radiation. We 
      utilized the protein truncation test (PTT), and single strand conformation 
      polymorphism (SSCP) on cDNA, as well as denaturing high performance liquid 
      chromatography (dHPLC) on genomic DNA (gDNA) to screen for mutations in 24 Polish 
      A-T families. Twenty-six distinct Short Tandem Repeat (STR) haplotypes were 
      identified. Three founder mutations accounted for 58% of the alleles. 
      Three-quarters of the families had at least one recurring (shared) mutation, 
      which was somewhat surprising given the low frequency of consanguinity in Poland. 
      STR haplotyping greatly improved the efficiency of mutation detection. We 
      identified 44 of the expected 48 mutations (92%): sixty-nine percent were 
      nonsense mutations, 23% caused aberrant splicing, and 5% were missense mutations. 
      Four mutations have not been previously described. Two of the Polish mutations 
      have been observed previously in Amish and Mennonite A-T patients; this is 
      compatible with historical records. Shared mutations shared the same Single 
      Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) and STR haplotypes, indicating common ancestries. 
      The Mennonite mutation, 5932 G>T, is common in Russian A-T families, and the STR 
      haplovariants are the same in both Poland and Russia. Attempts to correlate 
      phenotypes with genotypes were inconclusive due to the limited numbers of 
      patients with identical mutations.

TI  - SCA28, a novel form of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia on chromosome 
      18p11.22-q11.2.
PG  - 235-42
AB  - We describe a four-generation Italian family with a novel form of juvenile-onset, 
      slowly progressive, autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia. Eleven affected family 
      members have been evaluated. The mean age at onset was 19.5 years with no 
      evidence of anticipation. The first symptoms were invariably unbalanced standing 
      and mild gait incoordination. Gaze-evoked nystagmus was prominent at onset, while 
      patients with longer disease duration developed slow saccades, ophthalmoparesis 
      and, often, ptosis. Deep tendon reflexes in lower limbs were increased in 80% of 
      the cases. Genetic analysis excluded the presence of pathological repeat 
      expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1-3, 6-8, 10, 12 and 17, and 
      DRPLA genes. Linkage exclusion tests showed no evidence of association with other 
      known SCA loci. A genome-wide screen analysis identified linkage with chromosome 
      18 markers. A maximum two-point limit of determination score of 4.20 was found 
      for marker D18S53. Haplotype analysis refined a critical region of 7.9 Mb between 
      markers D18S1418 and D18S1104. This new SCA locus on 18p11.22-q11.2 has been 
      designated SCA28. Candidate genes within the critical interval are currently 
      screened for mutations.

TI  - Towards a structural understanding of the fibrillization pathway in 
      Machado-Joseph's disease: trapping early oligomers of non-expanded ataxin-3.
PG  - 642-54
AB  - Machado-Joseph's disease is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion that 
      is translated into an abnormally long polyglutamine tract in the protein 
      ataxin-3. Except for the polyglutamine region, proteins associated with 
      polyglutamine diseases are unrelated, and for all of these diseases aggregates 
      containing these proteins are the major components of the nuclear proteinaceous 
      deposits found in the brain. Aggregates of the expanded proteins display 
      amyloid-like morphological and biophysical properties. Human ataxin-3 containing 
      a non-pathological number of glutamine residues (14Q), as well as its 
      Caenorhabditis elegans (1Q) orthologue, showed a high tendency towards 
      self-interaction and aggregation, under near-physiological conditions. In order 
      to understand the discrete steps in the assembly process leading to ataxin-3 
      oligomerization, we have separated chromatographically high molecular mass 
      oligomers as well as medium mass multimers of non-expanded ataxin-3. We show 
      that: (a) oligomerization occurs independently of the poly(Q)-repeat and it is 
      accompanied by an increase in beta-structure; and (b) the first intermediate in 
      the oligomerization pathway is a Josephin domain-mediated dimer of ataxin-3. 
      Furthermore, non-expanded ataxin-3 oligomers are recognized by a specific 
      antibody that targets a conformational epitope present in soluble cytotoxic 
      species found in the fibrillization pathway of expanded polyglutamine proteins 
      and other amyloid-forming proteins. Imaging of the oligomeric forms of the 
      non-pathological protein using electron microscopy reveals globular particles, as 
      well as short chains of such particles that likely mimic the initial stages in 
      the fibrillogenesis pathway occurring in the polyglutamine-expanded protein. 
      Thus, they constitute potential targets for therapeutic approaches in 
      Machado-Joseph's disease, as well as valuable diagnostic markers in disease 
      settings.

TI  - New mutations in protein kinase Cgamma associated with spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 14.
PG  - 720-9
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a heterogeneous group of 
      neurological disorders. Point mutations in the gene encoding protein kinase 
      Cgamma (PRKCG) are responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia 14 (SCA14). We screened 
      for mutations in the PRKCG gene, in a large series of 284 ADCA index cases, 
      mostly French (n=204) and German (n=48), in whom CAG repeat expansions in the 
      known SCA genes were previously excluded. Six mutations were found that 
      segregated with the disease and were not detected on 560 control chromosomes, 
      including F643L (exon 18), already reported in another French kindred. Five new 
      missense mutations were identified in exons 4 (C114Y/G123R/G123E), 10 (G360S) and 
      18 (V692G). All but one (V692G) were located in highly conserved regions of the 
      regulatory or catalytic domains of the protein. All six SCA14 families were 
      French and there was no evidence of reduced penetrance. The phenotype consisted 
      in a very slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia with a mean age at onset of 
      33.5+/-14.2 years (range 15 to 60 years), occasionally associated with executive 
      dysfunction, myoclonus, myorythmia, tremor or decreased vibration sense. SCA14 
      represented only 1.5% (7/454) of French ADCA families but none of the German 
      families. It should, however, be considered in patients with slowly progressive 
      ADCA, particularly when myoclonus and cognitive impairment are present.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2: polyQ repeat variation in the CACNA1A calcium 
      channel modifies age of onset.
PG  - 2297-303
AB  - Nine neurodegenerative diseases, collectively referred to as polyglutamine 
      (polyQ) diseases, are caused by expansion of a coding CAG DNA trinucleotide 
      repeat. PolyQ diseases show a strong inverse correlation between CAG repeat 
      length and age of disease onset (AO). Despite this, individuals with identical 
      repeat expansion alleles can have highly variable disease onset indicating that 
      other factors also influence AO. We examined AO in 148 individuals in 57 sibships 
      from the SCA2 founder population in Cuba. The mutant CAG repeat allele explained 
      57% of AO variance. To estimate heritability of the residual variance after 
      correction for SCA2 repeat length, we applied variance component analysis and 
      determined the coefficient of intraclass correlation. We found that 55% of the 
      residual AO variance was familial. To test candidate modifier alleles in this 
      population, we selected 64 unrelated individuals from a set of 394 individuals 
      who were highly discordant for AO after correction for SCA2 CAG repeat length. We 
      hypothesized that long normal alleles in the other 8 polyQ disease genes were 
      associated with premature disease onset in SCA2. Of the 8 genes tested, only long 
      normal CAG repeats in the CACNA1A gene were associated with disease onset earlier 
      than expected based on SCA2 CAG repeat size using non-parametric tests for 
      alleles (P < 0.04) and genotypes (P < 0.023) after correction for multiple 
      comparisons. CACNA1A variation explained 5.8% of the residual variation in AO. 
      The CACNA1A calcium channel subunit represents an excellent candidate as a 
      modifier of disease in SCA2. It is highly expressed in Purkinje cells (PCs) and 
      is essential for the generation of the P/Q current and the complex spike in PCs. 
      In contrast to other polyQ proteins, which are nuclear, the CACNA1A and SCA2 
      proteins are both cytoplasmic. Furthermore, small pathologic expansions of the 
      polyQ domain in the CACNA1A protein lead to PC degeneration in SCA6. Future 
      studies are needed to determine whether the modifier effect of CACNA1A relates to 
      neuronal dysfunction or cell death of Purkinje neurons.

TI  - The AUUCU repeats responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 form unusual RNA 
      hairpins.
PG  - 29340-5
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by 
      expansion of a pentameric repeat tract (ATTCT.AGAAT)(n) in intron 9 of the gene 
      that encodes ataxin-10. We have analyzed duplex DNA containing the repeat, the 
      individual DNA strands, and the RNA that would be generated by transcription of 
      the repeat. Circular dichroism and UV absorbance measurements suggest that the 
      previously reported tendency of the repeat to unpair when supercoiled is probably 
      related simply to GC content rather than reflecting any unusual property of the 
      duplex. DNA containing d(ATTCT)9 forms a folded structure at relatively low 
      temperatures, whereas the antisense strand, d(AGAAT)9, does not form a structure 
      even at 0 degrees C. In contrast r(AUUCU)9 forms a folded structure under 
      physiologically reasonable conditions. S1 nuclease analysis reveals a single 
      region of hypersensitivity in the middle of the repeat tract, whereas V1 
      digestion is consistent with a hydrogen bonded or well stacked structure. CD 
      spectroscopy shows that the structure is unimolecular and hydrogen bonded and has 
      a significant amount of A-form helix. NMR spectroscopy demonstrates that these 
      hydrogen bonds comprise an equal number of A.U and U.U base pairs. Our data thus 
      suggest that the repeat forms an unusual RNA hairpin. Thus the ability to form an 
      RNA hairpin seems to be a common property of those Repeat Expansion Diseases that 
      are not recessively inherited and are caused by repeats that are transcribed but 
      not translated.

TI  - Degeneration of the inferior olive in spinocerebellar ataxia 6 may depend on 
      disease duration: report of two autopsy cases and statistical analysis of autopsy 
      cases reported to date.
PG  - 125-35
AB  - This report concerns a clinicopathological study of two autopsied patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 6 (SCA6), and a statistical analysis between neuronal loss 
      of the inferior olive and disease duration of 15 SCA6 autopsy cases reported to 
      date, including the two cases reported in this study. Cases 1 and 2 came from 
      independent Japanese families. Case 1 developed gait disturbance at age 35 years 
      and died at age 78 years; she had a CAG-repeat expansion of the SCA6 gene 
      (25/13). Case 2 presented with gait disturbance at age 68 years and died at age 
      78 years; he had an expanded CAG-repeat of the SCA6 gene (22/13). 
      Neuropathological examination of both cases disclosed not only neuronal loss of 
      the Purkinje cells and inferior olive, but also some unnoticed features, 
      including cactus-like expansion of the dendrite of Purkinje cells and relative 
      preservation of Golgi cells in the granular layer of the cerebellum. Exploratory 
      statistical analysis between 11 SCA6 autopsy cases with neuronal loss in the 
      inferior olive (average disease duration: 27 years) and four SCA6 autopsy cases 
      without neuronal loss in the olive (average disease duration: 14.5 years) was 
      investigated by Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival and log-rank test, 
      retrospectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival revealed an obvious 
      difference between the two groups. Survival of 10 years after the disease onset 
      was 90.9% in the former 11 SCA6 autopsy cases, but was 50% in the latter four 
      SCA6 autopsy cases. Furthermore, a log-rank test on the two groups disclosed a 
      significant difference (P=0.0450). We postulate that the neuronal loss of the 
      inferior olive in SCA6 may depend on disease duration.

TI  - ATM haplotypes and associated mutations in Iranian patients with 
      ataxia-telangiectasia: recurring homozygosity without a founder haplotype.
PG  - 101-6
AB  - Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by 
      mutations in the ATM gene. The ATM gene spans more than 150 kb at chromosomal 
      region 11q23.1 and encodes a product of 3,056 amino acids. The ATM protein is a 
      serine/threonine protein kinase and is involved in oxidative stress, cell cycle 
      control, and DNA repair. We analyzed the 11q22-23 haplotypes and associated 
      mutations of 16 Iranian families. We utilized standardized short tandem repeat 
      (STR) haplotypes to enhance mutation identification. In addition to the STR 
      markers, single-nucleotide polymorphism haplotypes were determined, using three 
      critical polymorphisms. The entire gene was screened sequentially by protein 
      truncation testing, single-strand conformation polymorphism, and denaturing 
      high-performance liquid chromatography to identify the disease-causing mutations. 
      Of the expected 32 mutations, 25 (78%) were identified. All but two mutations led 
      to a truncated or null form of the ATM protein (nonsense, splice site, or 
      frameshift). Twelve mutations were identified for 15 haplotypes. Five mutations 
      were novel. Mutations were located throughout the entire gene, with no 
      clustering. Despite the absence of an Iranian founder mutation, three-fourths of 
      the families were homozygous, suggesting that many undetected ATM mutations still 
      exist in Iran. This study establishes a database for Iranian A-T families, and 
      extends the global spectrum of ATM mutations.

PG  - 1258-60
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 14 (SCA14) is associated with missense mutations in the 
      protein kinase C gamma gene (PRKCG), rather than a nucleotide repeat expansion. 
      In this large-scale study of PRKCG in patients with ataxia, two new missense 
      mutations, an in-frame deletion, and a possible splice site mutation were found 
      and can now be added to the four previously described missense mutations. The 
      genotype/phenotype correlations in these families are described.

      type 7 locus: evidence from an Indian family.
PG  - 155-157
LID - 10.1007/s10038-005-0233-0 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia 
      caused by CAG repeat expansion. We found expansion at SCA7 locus in only two out 
      of 235 Indian families clinically diagnosed for ataxia. In one of the families, a 
      de novo mutation was observed wherein a paternal allele in intermediate range of 
      31 CAG repeats expanded to 59 in the offspring leading to the disease. No 
      expanded alleles were observed in the sperm of the transmitting parent by small 
      pool PCR. This suggests that de novo expansion by a pre-zygotic event is unlikely 
      and could be post-zygotic. SCA7 expanded alleles from the two families were 
      present on different genetic backgrounds, indicating multiple origins of the 
      mutation.

TI  - A SCA7 CAG/CTG repeat expansion is stable in Drosophila melanogaster despite 
      modulation of genomic context and gene dosage.
PG  - 35-41
AB  - CAG and CTG repeat expansions are the cause of at least a dozen inherited 
      neurological disorders. In these so-called "dynamic mutation" diseases, the 
      expanded repeats display dramatic genetic instability, changing in size when 
      transmitted through the germline and within somatic tissues. As the molecular 
      basis of the repeat instability process remains poorly understood, modeling of 
      repeat instability in model organisms has provided some insights into potentially 
      involved factors, implicating especially replication and repair pathways. Studies 
      in mice have also shown that the genomic context of the repeat sequence is 
      required for CAG/CTG repeat instability in the case of spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 7 (SCA7), one of the most unstable of all CAG/CTG repeat disease loci. While 
      most studies of repeat instability have taken a candidate gene approach, unbiased 
      screens for factors involved in trinucleotide repeat instability have been 
      lacking. We therefore attempted to use Drosophila melanogaster to model expanded 
      CAG repeat instability by creating transgenic flies carrying trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions, deriving flies with SCA7 CAG90 repeats in cDNA and genomic context. 
      We found that SCA7 CAG90 repeats are stable in Drosophila, regardless of context. 
      To screen for genes whose reduced function might destabilize expanded CAG repeat 
      tracts in Drosophila, we crossed the SCA7 CAG90 repeat flies with various 
      deficiency stocks, including lines lacking genes encoding the orthologues of flap 
      endonuclease-1, PCNA, and MutS. In all cases, perfect repeat stability was 
      preserved, suggesting that Drosophila may not be a suitable system for 
      determining the molecular basis of SCA7 CAG repeat instability.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat analysis of spinocerebellar ataxia patients in Oman.
PG  - 61-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the profile of cytosine/adenine/guanine (CAG) repeat 
      expansion in Omani spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) patients. METHODS: Ten SCA 
      patients attending the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital Neurologic clinics, 
      Al-Khoud, Oman in the 3 years starting from January 2000 were recruited for this 
      study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples and CAG repeat 
      expansion analysis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing, 
      when required. RESULTS: The CAG triplet repeats leading to polyglutamine 
      expansion and neurodegeneration are seen in spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 
      and 17. By using primers for SCA 1, 2, 3 and 7, we found the repeats were in the 
      normal range and triplet repeats do not seem to be a common cause for ataxia in 
      Oman. CONCLUSION: Spinocerebellar ataxia in Oman has the normal range of CAG 
      repeats for the commonly found SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA7.

TI  - Clinical phenotype of Brazilian families with spinocerebellar ataxia 10.
PG  - 1509-12
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal dominant ataxia caused by 
      an ATTCT repeat expansion in an intron of the SCA10 gene. SCA10 has been reported 
      only in Mexican families, in which the disease showed a combination of cerebellar 
      ataxia and epilepsy. The authors report 28 SCA10 patients from five new Brazilian 
      families. All 28 patients showed cerebellar ataxia without epilepsy, suggesting 
      that the phenotypic expression of the SCA10 mutation differs between Brazilian 
      and Mexican families.

TI  - Can ataxin-2 be down-regulated by allele-specific de novo DNA methylation in SCA2 
      patients?
PG  - 1018-23
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion within the coding region of the ataxin-2 gene. Affected individuals 
      typically have between 34 and 57 CAG repeats. Signs of the disorder generally 
      begin in adulthood and include progressive ataxia, dysarthria, tremor, 
      hyporeflexia, and slow saccades. As with other trinucleotide repeat disorders, 
      SCA2 exhibits an inverse correlation between the size of the CAG repeat and the 
      age at onset of clinically detectable disease, with neonatal cases of SCA2 being 
      reported in individuals harboring over 200 CAG repeats. However, a wide range of 
      age at onset is typically observed, especially in individuals with < 40 CAG 
      repeats. CAG repeat number alone explains approximately 25-80% of the 
      variability. In this paper, we hypothesize that the level of mutant ataxin-2 
      protein in affected cells contributes to these differences. One of the mechanisms 
      that might influence this protein levels is de novo DNA methylation, which would 
      specifically target the allele with the expanded CAG repeat leading to 
      transcriptional silencing. Consequently, the symptoms of SCA2 would occur later 
      in the patient's life history. Our postulations, as well as those previously 
      reported to account for the phenotype of SCA2, are discussed.

TI  - Full-length expanded ataxin-3 enhances mitochondrial-mediated cell death and 
      decreases Bcl-2 expression in human neuroblastoma cells.
PG  - 1274-82
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      degeneration characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations. An 
      unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in MJD gene on long arm of chromosome 
      14 has been identified as the pathologic mutation of MJD and apoptosis was 
      previously shown to be responsible for the neuronal cell death of the disease. In 
      this study, we utilized human neuronal SK-N-SH cells stably transfected with 
      HA-tagged full-length MJD with 78 polyglutamine repeats to examine the effects of 
      polyglutamine expansion on neuronal cell survival in the early stage of disease. 
      Various pro-apoptotic agents were used to assess the tolerance of the mutant 
      cells and to compare the differences between cells with and without mutant 
      ataxin-3. Concentration- and time-dependent experiments showed that the increase 
      in staurosporine-induced cell death was more pronounced and accelerated in cells 
      containing expanded ataxin-3 via MTS assays. Interestingly, under basal 
      conditions, Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses showed a significant 
      decrease of Bcl-2 protein expression and an increase of cytochrome c in cells 
      containing expanded ataxin-3 when compared with those of the parental cells. The 
      same reduction of Bcl-2 was further confirmed in fibroblast cells with mutant 
      ataxin-3. In addition, exogenous expression of Bcl-2 desensitized SK-N-SH-MJD78 
      cells to poly-Q toxicity. These results indicated that mitochondrial-mediated 
      cell death plays a role in the pathogenesis of MJD. In our cellular model, 
      full-length expanded ataxin-3 that leads to neurodegenerative disorders 
      significantly impaired the expression of Bcl-2 protein, which may be, at least in 
      part, responsible for the weak tolerance to polyglutamine toxicity at the early 
      stage of disease and ultimately resulted in an increase of stress-induced cell 
      death upon apoptotic stress.

TI  - Mutation analysis in the fibroblast growth factor 14 gene: frameshift mutation 
      and polymorphisms in patients with inherited ataxias.
PG  - 118-20
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) with autosomal dominant inheritance are a 
      group of neurodegenerative disorders with overlapping as well as highly variable 
      phenotypes. Genetically, at least 25 different loci have been identified. Seven 
      SCAs are caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions, for 13 the chromosomal 
      localization is known solely. Recently, a missense mutation in the fibroblast 
      growth factor 14 gene (FGF14) has been reported in a Dutch family with a new 
      dominantly inherited form of SCA. To evaluate the frequency of mutations in the 
      FGF14 gene, we performed molecular genetic analyses for the five exons in 208 
      nonrelated familial ataxia cases and 208 control samples. In one patient, we 
      detected a novel single base pair deletion in exon 4 (c.487delA) creating a 
      frameshift mutation. In addition, we found DNA polymorphisms in exon 1a, 4, and 
      5, an amino-acid exchange at position 124, as well as a single-nucleotide 
      polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region of exon 5.

TI  - Genome-wide demethylation destabilizes CTG.CAG trinucleotide repeats in mammalian 
      cells.
PG  - 2979-89
AB  - Many neurological diseases, including myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease 
      and several spinocerebellar ataxias, result from intergenerational increases in 
      the length of a CTG.CAG repeat tract. Although the basis for intergenerational 
      repeat expansion is unclear, repeat tracts are especially unstable during 
      germline development and production of gametes. Mammalian development is 
      characterized by waves of genome-wide demethylation and remethylation. To test 
      whether changes in methylation status might contribute to trinucleotide repeat 
      instability, we examined the effects of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors on 
      trinucleotide repeat stability in mammalian cells. Using a selectable genetic 
      system for detection of repeat contractions in CHO cells, we showed that the rate 
      of contractions increased >1000-fold upon treatment with the DNA 
      methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR). The link between DNA 
      demethylation and repeat instability was strengthened by similar results obtained 
      with hydralazine treatment, which inhibits expression of DNA methyltransferase. 
      In human cells from myotonic dystrophy patients, treatment with 5-aza-CdR 
      strongly destabilized repeat tracts in the DMPK gene, with a clear bias toward 
      expansion. The bias toward expansion events and changes in repeat length that 
      occur in jumps, rather than by accumulation of small changes, are reminiscent of 
      the intergenerational repeat instability observed in human patients. The dramatic 
      destabilizing effect of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors supports the hypothesis 
      that changes in methylation patterns during epigenetic reprogramming may trigger 
      the intergenerational repeat expansions that lead to disease.

TI  - SMARCA2 and THAP11: potential candidates for polyglutamine disorders as evidenced 
      from polymorphism and protein-folding simulation studies.
PG  - 596-602

AB  - CAG repeat expansion is the cause of an ever-increasing list of neurodegenerative 
      disorders, especially hereditary ataxias. However, genes responsible for 10-50% 
      of the clinically diagnosed ataxias are still unidentified in different 
      populations. Traditional linkage and repeat expansion-detection based methods 
      complemented with human genome sequence and expression information can now 
      accelerate the pace of identification of putative disease candidates. We have 
      analyzed two CAG repeat containing loci, human SMARCA2 and THAP11, which are 
      expressed in the brain as putative candidates for SCAs, using computational as 
      well as polymorphism scanning approaches. Both loci exhibited features 
      characteristic of genes associated with repeat disorders. These loci are 
      polymorphic with respect to size and interruption pattern in the Indian 
      population. Furthermore, computational analysis of glutamine-stretch embedded 
      domains in the respective proteins predicted these regions to be "natively 
      unfolded" beyond a threshold of 40 glutamines. Comparative genome analysis 
      suggested a stabilizing influence of CAA interspersions in repeat tract in THAP11 
      but not in SMARCA2. Although repeat expansion could not be detected within these 
      genes in unidentified ataxia patients reported in India, we suggest that these 
      loci be screened in other populations, as there is a wide heterogeneity in the 
      prevalence of these disorders in different populations.

TI  - Behavioral disorder, dementia, ataxia, and rigidity in a large family with TATA 
      box-binding protein mutation.
PG  - 1314-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 is an autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the TATA box-binding protein gene. 
      Ataxia is typically the first sign whereas behavioral symptoms occur later. 
      OBJECTIVE: To characterize the unusual phenotypic expression of a large 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 kindred. DESIGN: Clinical, neuropathological, and 
      molecular genetic characterization of a 4-generation family with 16 affected 
      patients. RESULTS: Behavioral symptoms and frontal impairment dominated the early 
      stages preceding ataxia, rigidity, and dystonic movements. Neuropathological 
      examination showed cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar atrophy. Purkinje cell 
      loss and gliosis, pseudohypertrophic degeneration of the inferior olive, marked 
      neuronal loss and gliosis in the caudate nucleus, and in the medial thalamic 
      nuclei were salient features together with neuronal intranuclear inclusions 
      stained with anti-TATA box-binding protein and antipolyglutamine antibodies. The 
      disease was caused by a stable 52 CAG repeat expansion of the TATA box-binding 
      protein gene, although there was apparent variability in the age of onset. 
      CONCLUSION: The characteristics of this family broaden the clinical picture of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 17: initial presenile dementia with behavioral 
      symptoms should be added to ataxia, rigidity, and dystonic movements, which are 
      more commonly encountered.

TI  - Mutation in the catalytic domain of protein kinase C gamma and extension of the 
      phenotype associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 14.
PG  - 1242-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias comprise a clinically, 
      neuropathologically, and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. The vast majority of cases are caused by trinucleotide or 
      pentanucleotide repeat expansions in 9 different genes. Spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 14 (SCA14) is a relatively pure form of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia 
      mapped to chromosome 19q and caused by missense mutations in the gene encoding 
      protein kinase C gamma (PRKCG), which are all located in the regulatory domain. 
      OBJECTIVES: To identify new SCA14 families and to describe the associated 
      phenotype. METHODS: We describe a new SCA14 family of French ancestry with 14 
      patients and 4 probably affected individuals. Linkage to the SCA14 locus was 
      evaluated according to standard procedures using 5 markers covering the SCA14 
      candidate interval. All 18 exons of the PRKCG gene and splice junctions were 
      screened with direct sequencing in the index patient. RESULTS: Linkage to the 
      SCA14 locus was established with lod scores greater than 3 in the interval 
      between DNA segments D19S571 and D19S926. Direct sequencing of the PRKCG gene 
      revealed a T-to-C transition in exon 18 responsible for a novel missense 
      mutation, F643L, which mapped to a highly conserved amino acid of the catalytic 
      domain of protein kinase C gamma. The mutation showed complete segregation with 
      the disease phenotype, was present in all affected and probably affected 
      individuals, and was not observed on 410 control chromosomes from healthy white 
      subjects. Age at onset, assessed in 14 affected individuals, was broader than in 
      previous reports and ranged from childhood to age 60 years. All affected patients 
      had slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia frequently associated with brisk 
      reflexes. Cognitive impairment was also a striking feature in this family and has 
      not been reported previously. Interestingly, there was no axial myoclonus as 
      reported in a Japanese SCA14 family, but electrophysiological recordings in a 
      single patient showed diffuse myoclonus in the arms and legs. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      have identified a new SCA14 family with the first mutation (F643L) located in the 
      catalytic domain of the enzyme. The wide range of ages at onset, the presence of 
      myoclonus in the limbs, and the presence of cognitive impairment extend the 
      phenotype associated with this genetic entity.

TI  - Patterns of CAG repeat interruptions in SCA1 and SCA2 genes in relation to repeat 
      instability.
PG  - 236-47
AB  - About 3% of the human genome is composed of simple sequence repeats and many of 
      these sequences occur within genes. These repeats are often polymorphic in a 
      normal population and their expansion in specific genes leads to a number of 
      hereditary neurological diseases. Normal variants of disease-related genes 
      contain either pure or interrupted repeats, and the postulated function of the 
      interruptions is to prevent repeat expansions. Their structural role in the 
      repeat tracts of genes and transcripts awaits detailed characterization. In this 
      study, we have determined the SCA1 and SCA2 genotypes in a Polish population and 
      found significant differences in allele spectra and frequencies from those 
      reported for other populations. They are discussed in relation to the repeat 
      expansion mechanism and disease incidence. We postulate that the dynamic mutation 
      of the genes SCA1 (also ATX1 or ataxin 1) and SCA2 (also ATX2 or ataxin 2) may 
      begin from the expansion of long pure repeat tracts without the prior loss of 
      interruptions. A simple way of cost-effective allelotyping of CAG repeat regions 
      in the SCA1 and SCA2genes is also shown. The reliable SSCP/duplex analysis 
      presented here may be the method of choice for the systematic searching of genes 
      for known and novel interrupted repeats.

TI  - SCA db: spinocerebellar ataxia candidate gene database.
PG  - 2656-61
AB  - The positional candidate gene approach accelerates the discovery of genes 
      involved in disease. However, the properties of such disease genes are very 
      diverse and the sample size of known disease genes is too small and does not 
      warrant success by the use of a machine-learning approach. A user-defined scoring 
      system may thus help to determine the priority of candidate genes. 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a good model to test this approach because most 
      SCA subtypes are caused by an expansion of short tandem repeats (STRs). The SCA 
      db is a candidate gene database for SCA, which collected 3185 genes for 17 types 
      of SCA. Those SCA subtypes that have known disease genes can be used as positive 
      controls to optimize the parameters. The users may browse the candidate genes of 
      a given SCA subtype by using the default parameters. The known disease genes were 
      found to be the top three candidates using the default parameters. Alternatively, 
      the users may score the candidate genes by changing the weight or the scores on 
      the basis of their own working hypothesis. AVAILABILITY: This database is

TI  - Ataxin-10, the spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 neurodegenerative disorder protein, 
      is essential for survival of cerebellar neurons.
PG  - 35542-50
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 10, an autosomal dominant disease characterized 
      by cerebellar ataxia, is caused by a novel pentanucleotide (ATTCT) repeat 
      expansion in the SCA10 gene. Although clinical features of the disease are well 
      characterized, nothing is known so far about the affected SCA10 gene product, 
      ataxin-10 (Atx-10). We have cloned the rat SCA10 gene and expressed the 
      corresponding protein in HEK293 cells. Atx-10 has an apparent molecular mass of 
      approximately 55 kDa and belongs to the family of armadillo repeat proteins. In 
      solution, it tends to form homotrimeric complexes, which associate via a 
      tip-to-tip contact with the concave sides of the molecules facing each other. 
      Atx-10 immunostaining of mouse and human brain sections revealed a predominantly 
      cytoplasmic and perinuclear localization with a clear restriction to 
      olivocerebellar regions. Knock down of SCA10 in primary neuronal cells by small 
      interfering RNAs resulted in an increased apoptosis of cerebellar neurons, 
      arguing for a loss-of-function phenotype in SCA10 patients.

TI  - No association of the SCA1 (CAG)31 allele with Huntington's disease, myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1 and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.
PG  - 61-3
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansions are the underlying mutation in several 
      neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders including at least eight 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA). The molecular mechanisms of repeat expansion are 
      as yet insufficiently understood. Recently, an association of the SCA1 (CAG)31 
      repeat allele with Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy type 1 was 
      described. These findings implicate a possible role of the SCA1 (CAG)31 allele in 
      other triplet diseases. We analyzed the SCA1 CAG repeat length in a large sample 
      of Huntington's disease (n=182), myotonic dystrophy type 1 (n=64) and SCA3 (n=31) 
      patients. In none of these groups was a significant association with the 31 
      repeat allele found. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that this allele 
      is involved in the etiology of trinucleotide expansion.

TI  - Molecular genetics of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia: mutation analysis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia genes and CAG/CTG repeat expansion detection in 225 
      Italian families.
PG  - 727-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, at present 
      associated with 22 loci (spinocerebellar ataxia [SCA] 1-SCA8, SCA10-SCA19, SCA21, 
      SCA22, fibroblast growth factor 14 [FGF14]-SCA, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy [DRPLA]). The relevant gene has been identified in 12 cases (SCA1-3, 
      SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, FGF14, and DRPLA), and in all but the recently identified 
      SCA14, SCA17, PRKCG and FGF14 genes, the defect consists of the expansion of a 
      short nucleotide repeat. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relative prevalence of 
      SCA1-3, SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, and SCA17 gene expansions in Italian families with 
      hereditary ataxia, specifically to verify the occurrence of SCA10, SCA12, and 
      SCA17 in Italy; and to analyze samples from probands with negative test results 
      at the initial screening by means of the repeat expansion detection technique to 
      identify CAG/CTG expansions in novel loci.Patients Two hundred twenty-five 
      unrelated Italian index cases with hereditary ataxia, most (n = 183) of whom 
      presented with a clear dominantly transmitted trait. RESULTS: We found that SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene mutations accounted for most cases (21% and 24%, respectively). We 
      found SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, and SCA17 to be very rare (approximately 1% each), 
      and no case of SCA10 or SCA12 was identified. Half of the index cases (113/225) 
      were negative for expansions in the known SCA genes. Repeat expansion detection 
      analysis performed on 111 of these cases showed a CAG/CTG repeat expansion of at 
      least 50 triplets in 22 (20%). Twenty-one of 22 expansions could be attributed to 
      length variation at 2 polymorphic loci (expanded repeat domain CAG/CTG 1 [ERDA1] 
      or CTG repeat on chromosome 18q21.1 [CTG18.1]). In 1 patient, the expansion was 
      assigned to the DRPLA gene. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of SCA1-3 and SCA6-7 
      gene mutations is peculiar in Italy. We found a relatively high frequency of SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene expansions; SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 mutations were rare, compared with 
      other European countries. No SCA10 or SCA12 and only a few SCA8 (2/225) and SCA17 
      (2/225) families were detected. In patients negative for defects in known SCA 
      genes, repeat expansion detection data strongly suggest that, at least in our 
      population, CAG/CTG expansions in novel genes should be considered an unlikely 
      cause of the SCA phenotype.

TI  - Caspase-mediated proteolysis of the polyglutamine disease protein ataxin-3.
PG  - 908-18
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3, also known as Machado-Joseph Disease, is one of 
      many inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by polyglutamine-encoding CAG 
      repeat expansions in otherwise unrelated disease genes. Polyglutamine disorders 
      are characterized by disease protein misfolding and aggregation; often within the 
      nuclei of affected neurons. Although the precise mechanism of 
      polyglutamine-mediated cell death remains elusive, evidence suggests that 
      proteolysis of polyglutamine disease proteins by caspases contributes to 
      pathogenesis. Using cellular models we now show that the endogenous 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 disease protein, ataxin-3, is proteolyzed in 
      apoptotic paradigms, resulting in the loss of full-length ataxin-3 and the 
      corresponding appearance of an approximately 28-kDa fragment containing the 
      glutamine repeat. Broad-spectrum caspase inhibitors block ataxin-3 proteolysis 
      and studies suggest that caspase-1 is a primary mediator of cleavage. 
      Site-directed mutagenesis experiments eliminating three, six or nine potential 
      caspase cleavage sites in the protein suggest redundancy in the site(s) at which 
      cleavage can occur, as previously described for other disease proteins; but also 
      map a major cleavage event to a cluster of aspartate residues within the 
      ubiquitin-binding domain of ataxin-3 near the polyglutamine tract. Finally, 
      caspase-mediated cleavage of expanded ataxin-3 resulted in increased ataxin-3 
      aggregation, suggesting a potential role for caspase-mediated proteolysis in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 pathogenesis.

TI  - Ataxin-7 is a subunit of GCN5 histone acetyltransferase-containing complexes.
PG  - 1257-65
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the SCA7 gene leading to elongation of a polyglutamine 
      tract in ataxin-7, a protein of unknown function. A putative ataxin-7 yeast 
      orthologue (SGF73) has been identified recently as a new component of the SAGA 
      (Spt/Ada/Gcn5 acetylase) multisubunit complex, a coactivator required for 
      transcription of a subset of RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. We show here that 
      ataxin-7 is an integral component of the mammalian SAGA-like complexes, the 
      TATA-binding protein-free TAF-containing complex (TFTC) and the SPT3/TAF9/GCN5 
      acetyltransferase complex (STAGA). In agreement, immunoprecipitation of ataxin-7 
      retained a histone acetyltransferase activity, characteristic for TFTC-like 
      complexes. We further identified a minimal domain in ataxin-7 that is required 
      for interaction with TFTC/STAGA subunits and is conserved highly through 
      evolution, allowing the identification of a SCA7 gene family. We showed that this 
      domain contains a conserved Cys(3)His motif that binds zinc, forming a new 
      zinc-binding domain. Finally, polyglutamine expansion in ataxin-7 did not affect 
      its incorporation into TFTC/STAGA complexes purified from SCA7 patient cells. We 
      demonstrate here that ataxin-7 is the human orthologue of the yeast SAGA SGF73 
      subunit and is a bona fide subunit of the human TFTC-like transcriptional 
      complexes.

TI  - Detection of large pathogenic expansions in FRDA1, SCA10, and SCA12 genes using a 
      simple fluorescent repeat-primed PCR assay.
PG  - 96-100
AB  - At least 18 human genetic diseases are caused by expansion of short tandem 
      repeats. Here we describe a successful application of a fluorescent PCR method 
      for the detection of expanded repeats in FRDA1, SCA10, and SCA12 genes. Although 
      this test cannot give a precise estimate of the size of the expansion, it is 
      robust, reliable, and inexpensive, and can be used to screen large series of 
      patients. It proved useful for confirming the presence of large expansions in the 
      Friedreich ataxia gene following an ambiguous result of long-range PCR, as well 
      as rapid pre-screening for large repeat expansions associated with Friedreich 
      ataxia and SCA10 and the shorter repeat expansions associated with SCA12.

TI  - Analysis of trinucleotide repeats in different SCA loci in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      patients and in normal population of Taiwan.
PG  - 355-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) patients referred to our research 
      center, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD (Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, SCA8 and SCA12 
      loci were assessed for expansion of trinucleotide repeats. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      A total of 211 ADCA patients, including 202 patients with dominantly inherited 
      ataxia from 81 Taiwanese families and nine patients with sporadic ataxia, were 
      included in this study and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. 
      The amplified products of all loci were analyzed on both 3% agarose gels and 6% 
      denaturing urea-polyacrylamide gels. PCR-based Southern blots were also applied 
      for the detection of SCA7 locus. RESULTS: The SCA1 mutation was detected in six 
      affected individuals from one family (1.2%) with expanded alleles of 50-53 CAG 
      repeats. Fourteen individuals from nine families (11%) had a CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while affected SCA2 alleles have 34-49 CAG 
      repeats. The SCA3/MJD CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in 60 affected 
      individuals from 26 families (32%) was expanded to 71-85 CAG repeats. As for the 
      SCA7 locus, there were two affected individuals from one family (1.2%) possessed 
      41 and 100 CAG repeats, respectively. However, we did not detect expansion in the 
      SCA6, SCA8 and SCA12 loci in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The SCA3/MJD CAG expansion 
      was the most frequent mutation among the SCA patients. The relative prevalence of 
      SCA3/MJD in Taiwan was higher than that of SCA2, SCA1 and SCA7.

TI  - Haplotype study in Dutch SCA3 and SCA6 families: evidence for common founder 
      mutations.
PG  - 441-6
AB  - This pilot study was initiated to show the existence of founder effects in the 
      Dutch autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) population. The ADCAs comprise 
      a clinically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders and the estimated 
      prevalence in the Netherlands is approximately 3:100 000 individuals. Here, we 
      focused on the SCA3 and SCA6 genes because mutations in these genes occur most 
      frequently in the Netherlands. We were able to determine a common origin of the 
      CAG repeat expansions in the majority of Dutch SCA3 and SCA6 families. Haplotype 
      analysis and linkage disequilibrium studies with polymorphic markers revealed 
      shared haplotypes surrounding the SCA3 and SCA6 genes. These results strongly 
      suggest that ADCA families can be traced back to common ancestors in particular 
      parts of the Netherlands.

TI  - Dominantly inherited ataxia and dysphonia with dentate calcification: 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 20.
PG  - 1172-81
AB  - We describe a pedigree of Anglo-Celtic origin with a phenotypically unique form 
      of dominantly inherited spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) in 14 personally examined 
      affected members. A remarkable observation is dentate nucleus calcification, 
      producing a low signal on MRI sequences. Unusually for an SCA, dysarthria is 
      typically the initial manifestation. Mild pyramidal signs and hypermetric 
      saccades are noted in some. Its distinguishing clinical features, each present in 
      a majority of affected persons, are palatal tremor, and a form of dysphonia 
      resembling spasmodic dysphonia. Repeat expansion detection failed to identify 
      either CAG/CTG or ATTCT/AGAAT repeat expansions segregating with the disease in 
      this family. The testable SCA mutations have been excluded. On linkage analysis, 
      the locus maps to chromosome 11, which rules out all the remaining mapped SCAs 
      except for SCA5. While locus homogeneity with SCA5 is not formally excluded, we 
      consider it rather unlikely on phenotypic grounds, and propose that this 
      condition may represent an addition to the group of neurogenetic disorders 
      subsumed under the rubric SCA. The International Nomenclature Committee has made 
      a provisional assignment of 'SCA20', although firm designation will have to await 
      a definite molecular distinction from SCA5.

TI  - The spinocerebellar ataxia 8 noncoding RNA causes neurodegeneration and 
      associates with staufen in Drosophila.
PG  - 302-8
AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia 8 (SCA8) appears unique among triplet repeat 
      expansion-induced neurodegenerative diseases because the predicted gene product 
      is a noncoding RNA. Little is currently known about the normal function of SCA8 
      in neuronal survival or how repeat expansion contributes to neurodegeneration. To 
      investigate the molecular context in which SCA8 operates, we have expressed the 
      human SCA8 noncoding RNA in Drosophila. SCA8 induces late-onset, progressive 
      neurodegeneration in the Drosophila retina. Using this neurodegenerative 
      phenotype as a sensitized background for a genetic modifier screen, we have 
      identified mutations in four genes: staufen, muscle-blind, split ends, and 
      CG3249. All four encode neuronally expressed RNA binding proteins conserved in 
      Drosophila and humans. Although expression of both wild-type and repeat-expanded 
      SCA8 induce neurodegeneration, the strength of interaction with certain modifiers 
      differs between the two SCA8 backgrounds, suggesting that CUG expansions alter 
      associations with specific RNA binding proteins. Our demonstration that SCA8 can 
      recruit Staufen and that the interaction domain maps to the portion of the SCA8 
      RNA that undergoes repeat expansion in the human disease suggests a specific 
      mechanism for SCA8 function and disease. Genetic modifiers identified in our 
      SCA8-based screens may provide candidates for designing therapeutic interventions 
      to treat this disease.

TI  - Possible reduced penetrance of expansion of 44 to 47 CAG/CAA repeats in the 
      TATA-binding protein gene in spinocerebellar ataxia type 17.
PG  - 209-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is an autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia caused by expansion of CAG/CAA trinucleotide repeats in the 
      TATA-binding protein (TBP) gene. Because the number of triplets in patients with 
      SCA17 in previous studies ranged from 43 to 63, the normal number of 
      trinucleotide units has been considered to be 42 or less. However, some healthy 
      subjects in SCA17 pedigrees carry alleles with the same number of expanded 
      repeats as patients with SCA17. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the minimum number of 
      CAG/CAA repeats in the TBP gene that causes SCA17. DESIGN: We amplified the 
      region of the TBP gene containing the CAG/CAA repeat by means of polymerase chain 
      reaction and performed fragment and sequence analyses. PATIENTS: The subjects 
      included 734 patients with SCA (480 patients with sporadic SCA and 254 patients 
      with familial SCA) without CAG repeat expansions at the SCA1, SCA2, 
      Machado-Joseph disease, SCA6, SCA7, or dentatorubral-pallidolluysian atrophy 
      loci, with 162 healthy subjects, 216 patients with Parkinson disease, and 195 
      with Alzheimer disease as control subjects. RESULTS: Eight patients with SCA 
      possessed an allele with more than 43 CAG/CAA repeats. Among the non-SCA groups, 
      alleles with 43 to 45 repeats were seen in 3 healthy subjects and 2 with 
      Parkinson disease. In 1 SCA pedigree, a patient with possible SCA17 and her 
      healthy sister had alleles with 45 repeats. A 34-year-old man carrying alleles 
      with 47 and 44 repeats (47/44) had developed progressive cerebellar ataxia and 
      myoclonus at 25 years of age, and he exhibited dementia and pyramidal signs. He 
      was the only affected person in his pedigree, although his father and mother 
      carried alleles with mildly expanded repeats (44/36 and 47/36, respectively). In 
      another pedigree, 1 patient carried a 43-repeat allele, whereas another patient 
      had 2 normal alleles, indicating that the 43-repeat allele may not be pathologic 
      in this family. CONCLUSIONS: We estimate that 44 CAG/CAA repeats is the minimum 
      number required to cause SCA17. However, the existence of unaffected subjects 
      with mildly expanded triplets suggests that the TBP gene mutation may not 
      penetrate fully. Homozygosity of alleles with mildly expanded triplet repeats in 
      the TBP gene might contribute to the pathologic phenotype.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia: SCA2 is the most frequent mutation in 
      eastern India.
PG  - 448-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) has been reported as the 
      commonest dominant hereditary ataxia in India. However, India is an ethnically 
      and religiously diverse population. Previous studies have not clearly indicated 
      exact ethnic and religious origins, and must therefore be interpreted with 
      caution. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of different 
      SCA mutations in a relatively homogeneous population from eastern India. METHODS: 
      We identified 28 families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia from eastern 
      India. Each underwent full clinical evaluation and were analysed for the presence 
      of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, and SCA17 mutations. In addition, 
      haplotype analysis was carried out in seven of the 16 families with SCA2. 
      RESULTS: Seven patients from four (14%) families were positive for an expansion 
      in SCA1 and 26 patients from 16 (57%) families were positive for an expansion in 
      SCA2. No mutations were detected in the remaining eight families (29%). Most of 
      the SCA1 and SCA2 families were Hindu from the state of Bihar. Five out of 26 
      SCA2 patients in this study did not have slow saccades. In addition, four of 
      seven SCA1 patients had slow saccades. We found an association between the SCA2 
      CAG repeat expansion and the 285 base pair (bp) allele of microsatellite marker 
      D12S1672, and also data supportive of the association between the expansion and 
      the 225 bp allele of D12S1333, which has been previously described. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We conclude that (1) although slow ocular saccades are highly suggestive of SCA2, 
      that they are not universal, nor are they exclusive to this disorder and (2) SCA2 
      is likely to be the commonest dominant ataxia in eastern India, with further 
      evidence for a founder effect.

TI  - Analysis of CAG repeat expansions in restless legs syndrome.
PG  - 1055-7
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: A relatively high prevalence of restless legs syndrome symptoms 
      has been recently reported in a substantial proportion of patients affected with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. Our aim was to investigate whether there is a 
      common genetic etiology between restless legs syndrome and spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 3. DESIGN: Systematic differences in the number of spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 3 trinucleotide repeat were investigated by means of an association study. 
      The relationship between the size of the expanded alleles and several clinical 
      features was also considered. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 125 extensively 
      characterized restless legs syndrome patients compared with 188 healthy controls 
      matched for ethnic background. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: No 
      CAG repeat expansions in the pathologic or intermediate range were detected in 
      any of the examined subjects, including patients and controls. A similar allelic 
      distribution was observed in both groups (Mann-Whitney U test = 78406; P = 0.99). 
      Moreover, stratification analyses of the patients' samples according to different 
      clinical and polysomnographic variables disclosed no significant differences. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results do not provide evidence toward an involvement of large 
      CAG trinucleotide expansions at the spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 locus in 
      idiopathic restless legs syndrome.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia with sensory neuropathy (SCA25) maps to chromosome 2p.
PG  - 97-104
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias constitute one of the most clinically, 
      neuropathologically, and genetically heterogeneous groups of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. Approximately 50 to 80% of the families carry mutations in genes known 
      to be implicated in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Numerous loci (SCAn) also 
      have been mapped, often in single families, but the responsible genes have not 
      yet been identified. This suggests further genetic heterogeneity. We have 
      ascertained 18 subjects from a large French family in which cerebellar ataxia and 
      prominent sensory neuropathy segregated as a dominant trait. Intrafamilial 
      variability was high regarding age at onset (17 months to 39 years), severity, 
      and the clinical picture that ranged from pure sensory neuropathy with little 
      cerebellar involvement to a Friedreich's ataxia-like phenotype. After excluding 
      known genes/loci responsible for SCA and hereditary sensory neuropathies, we 
      detected linkage with chromosome 2p markers in a genomewide screen. We designated 
      this new locus SCA25 after testing of 16 additional markers. Maximum two-point 
      logarithm of odds scores of 3.15 and 3.10 were obtained at D2S2378 and D2S2734, 
      respectively. Haplotype analysis defined a critical 12.6cM region of 15Mb between 
      D2S2174 and D2S2736. No linkage to this locus was found in four other families. 
      This interval contains several genes that could be responsible for the disease. 
      One of these genes, CRIPT, encodes a postsynaptic protein, but no mutations were 
      found by direct sequencing, excluding its responsibility in the disease. CAG 
      repeat expansions often are involved in SCA pathogenesis, but no pathological 
      expansions were found at the protein or at the DNA level using the 1C2 antibody 
      and the repeat expansion detection method, respectively. The gene responsible for 
      SCA25 remains to be identified.

AB  - We report on a family with ataxia type 6 (SCA6) showing peculiar oculomotor 
      symptoms. The proband presented with periodic alternating nystagmus (PAN), and 
      her 2 brothers had rebound nystagmus and gaze-evoked nystagmus. They carried the 
      identical mutation (the number of expanded CAG repeat, 24) in the CACNA1A gene. 
      The intrafamilial variability of oculomotor symptoms may be ascribed to factors 
      other than CAG repeat expansion size in SCA6.

TI  - Clinical features and neuropathology of autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA17).
PG  - 367-75
AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders clinically characterized by late-onset ataxia and 
      variable other manifestations. Genetically and clinically, SCA is highly 
      heterogeneous. Recently, CAG repeat expansions in the gene encoding TATA-binding 
      protein (TBP) have been found in a new form of SCA, which has been designated 
      SCA17. To estimate the frequency of SCA17 among white SCA patients and to define 
      the phenotypic variability, we determined the frequency of SCA17 in a large 
      sample of 1,318 SCA patients. In total, 15 patients in four autosomal dominant 
      SCA families had CAG/CAA repeat expansions in the TBP gene ranging from 45 to 54 
      repeats. The clinical features of our SCA17 patients differ from other SCA types 
      by manifesting with psychiatric abnormalities and dementia. The neuropathology of 
      SCA17 can be classified as a "pure cerebellar" or "cerebello-olivary" form of 
      ataxia. However, intranuclear neuronal inclusion bodies with immunoreactivity to 
      anti-TBP and antipolyglutamine were much more widely distributed throughout the 
      brain gray matter than in other SCAs. Based on clinical and genetic data, we 
      conclude that SCA17 is rare among white SCA patients. SCA17 should be considered 
      in sporadic and familial cases of ataxia with accompanying psychiatric symptoms 
      and dementia.

TI  - Prenatal diagnosis of Machado-Joseph disease/Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 in 
      Taiwan: early detection of expanded ataxin-3.
PG  - 195-200
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3) is a rare 
      autosomal dominative disorder in which one of the neurodegenerative disorders is 
      caused by a translated CAG repeat expansion. Here, we present the first prenatal 
      diagnosis of MJD in Taiwan in a woman whose husband was known to carry an 
      unstable CAG repeat expansion in the MJD gene. After evaluating the couples' 
      motivation and psychological tolerance, amniocentesis was performed at gestation 
      of 13 weeks. The diagnosis was made using a simple nonradioactive polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) for rapid detection of the presence of an expanded MJD 
      allele. Meanwhile, using radioactive PCR, we identified the presence of an 
      unusual shortness of CAG expansion in the MJD gene with 74 repeats in the fetus 
      compared with 78 repeats in the father. After termination of the pregnancy, 
      Western blot analysis further confirmed the presence of normal and mutant 
      ataxin-3 in the fetal tissue. In summary, we have performed the first prenatal 
      diagnosis of MJD in Taiwan, and described our experience with an at-risk male 
      requesting counseling, carrier testing, and prenatal diagnosis for Machado-Joseph 
      disease. Early detection of both normal and expanded ataxin-3 in fetal tissues 
      was first demonstrated in the present study.

TI  - SCA17 caused by homozygous repeat expansion in TBP due to partial isodisomy 6.
PG  - 629-32
AB  - An expanded polyglutamine domain in the TATA-binding protein (TBP) has been 
      described in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) characterized 
      by cerebellar ataxia associated with dementia. TBP is a general transcription 
      initiation factor that regulates the expression of most eukaryotic genes 
      transcribed by RNA polymerase II. SCA17, as an autosomal dominantly inherited 
      progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is caused by heterozygous expansion of a 
      CAG repeat coding for glutamine. Alleles with 27 to a maximum of 44 glutamine 
      residues were found as the normal range, whereas expansions above 45 repeat units 
      were considered pathological. Here, we present a patient with a very severe 
      phenotype with a late onset but rapidly progressing ataxia associated with 
      dementia and homozygous 47 glutamine residues caused by an apparent partial 
      isodisomy 6. This extraordinary case has important implications for the insights 
      of TBP and SCA17. The expanded polyglutamine domain in both TBP copies is not 
      correlated with embryonic death indicating that the normal function of the 
      protein is not disrupted by this kind of mutation but may account for the 
      dementia seen in this patient.

TI  - Independent mutational events are rare in the ATM gene: haplotype prescreening 
      enhances mutation detection rate.
PG  - 43-50
AB  - Mutations in the ATM gene are responsible for the autosomal recessive disorder 
      ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). Many different mutations have been identified using 
      various techniques, with detection efficiencies ranging from 57 to 85%. In this 
      study, we employed short tandem repeat (STR) haplotypes to enhance mutation 
      identification in 55 unrelated A-T families of Iberian origin (20 Spanish, 17 
      Brazilian, and 18 Hispanic-American); we were able to identify 95% of the 
      expected mutations. Allelic sizes were standardized based on a reference sample 
      (CEPH 1347-2). Subsequent mutation screening was performed by PTT, SSCP, and 
      DHPLC, and abnormal regions were sequenced. Many STR haplotypes were found within 
      each population and six haplotypes were observed across several of these 
      populations. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) haplotypes further suggested 
      that most of these common mutations are ancestrally related, and not hot spots. 
      However, two mutations (8977C>T and 8264_8268delATAAG) may indeed be recurring 
      mutational events. Common haplotypes were present in 13 of 20 Spanish A-T 
      families (65%), in 11 of 17 Brazilian A-T families (65%), and, in contrast, in 
      only eight of 18 Hispanic-American families (44%). Three mutations were 
      identified that would be missed by conventional screening strategies. In all, 62 
      different mutations (28 not previously reported) were identified and their 
      associated haplotypes defined, thereby establishing a new database for Iberian 
      A-T families, and extending the spectrum of worldwide ATM mutations.

TI  - Frequency analysis and clinical characterization of spinocerebellar ataxia types 
      1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 in Korean patients.
PG  - 858-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: By genetic analysis, the CAG repeat expansion has been established in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. Despite the genetic 
      differentiation of SCA, the characterization of the phenotypes of various SCAs 
      has been challenging for better clinical diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the 
      frequencies and the clinical manifestations of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 
      in Korean patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed genetic analysis in 253 
      unrelated Korean patients with progressive cerebellar ataxia. We compared the 
      frequencies, inheritance patterns, and various clinical manifestations of 
      patients with genetically confirmed SCA. RESULTS: Among the 52 patients with 
      expanded CAG repeat, the most frequent SCA type was SCA2, followed by SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA1, and SCA7. Nine patients (17%) had a negative family history of ataxia, 
      mostly in SCA6. There were characteristic clinical features such as hypotonia and 
      optic atrophy for SCA1; hyporeflexia for SCA2; nystagmus, bulging eye, and 
      dystonia for SCA3; and macular degeneration for SCA7. Interestingly, 4 patients 
      (1 with SCA2, 1 with SCA3, and 2 with SCA6) were misdiagnosed as having 
      multiple-system atrophy because of the absence of family history and the presence 
      of parkinsonism and urinary incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a 
      detailed analysis of the clinical characteristics of the genetically defined 
      CAG-repeat SCAs in Korean patients. Although phenotypes were heterogeneous, some 
      clinical features may be helpful for clinical diagnosis. However, genetic studies 
      for SCA are needed despite uncertain family history or the presence of atypical 
      clinical features causing misdiagnosis as atypical parkinsonism.

TI  - Refinement of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 4 locus in a large German family 
      and exclusion of CAG repeat expansions in this region.
PG  - 668-71
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 4 (SCA4) is an autosomal dominant disorder mapped to 
      chromosome 16q22.1 in a large Utah kindred. The clinical phenotype is 
      characterized by cerebellar ataxia with sensory neuropathy. We describe a 
      five-generation family from northern Germany with similar clinical findings 
      linked to the same locus. Haplotype analyses refined the gene locus to a 3.69 cM 
      interval between D16S3019 and D16S512. Analysis of nine CAG/CTG tracts in this 
      region revealed no evidence for a repeat expansion.

TI  - Interaction of Akt-phosphorylated ataxin-1 with 14-3-3 mediates neurodegeneration 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.
PG  - 457-68
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is one of several neurological disorders 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion. In SCA1, this expansion produces an abnormally 
      long polyglutamine tract in the protein ataxin-1. Mutant polyglutamine proteins 
      accumulate in neurons, inducing neurodegeneration, but the mechanism underlying 
      this accumulation has been unclear. We have discovered that the 14-3-3 protein, a 
      multifunctional regulatory molecule, mediates the neurotoxicity of ataxin-1 by 
      binding to and stabilizing ataxin-1, thereby slowing its normal degradation. The 
      association of ataxin-1 with 14-3-3 is regulated by Akt phosphorylation, and in a 
      Drosophila model of SCA1, both 14-3-3 and Akt modulate neurodegeneration. Our 
      finding that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling and 14-3-3 cooperate to 
      modulate the neurotoxicity of ataxin-1 provides insight into SCA1 pathogenesis 
      and identifies potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Proteolytic cleavage and cellular toxicity of the human alpha1A calcium channel 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 74-8
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by 
      small CAG repeat expansion in the alpha1A calcium channel gene. We found that the 
      human alpha1A calcium channel protein expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T 
      cells produces a 75 kDa C-terminal fragment. This fragment is more toxic to cells 
      than the full-length alpha1A calcium channel, regardless of polyglutamine tract 
      length. In cells stably transfected with plasmids of full-length alpha1A calcium 
      channel cDNAs, the C-terminal fragment protein is present in the mutant 
      transformant but not in the wild-type one, indicative that this C-terminal 
      fragment with the expanded polyglutamine tract is more resistant to proteolysis 
      than that with the normal sized polyglutamine tract. We speculate that the toxic 
      C-terminal fragment, in which resistance to proteolysis is rendered by the 
      expanded polyglutamine, has a key role in the pathological mechanism of SCA6.

TI  - Missense mutations in the regulatory domain of PKC gamma: a new mechanism for 
      dominant nonepisodic cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 839-49
AB  - We report a nonepisodic autosomal dominant (AD) spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) not 
      caused by a nucleotide repeat expansion that is, to our knowledge, the first such 
      SCA. The AD SCAs currently comprise a group of > or =16 genetically distinct 
      neurodegenerative conditions, all characterized by progressive incoordination of 
      gait and limbs and by speech and eye-movement disturbances. Six of the nine SCAs 
      for which the genes are known result from CAG expansions that encode 
      polyglutamine tracts. Noncoding CAG, CTG, and ATTCT expansions are responsible 
      for three other SCAs. Approximately 30% of families with SCA do not have linkage 
      to the known loci. We recently mapped the locus for an AD SCA in a family (AT08) 
      to chromosome 19q13.4-qter. A particularly compelling candidate gene, PRKCG, 
      encodes protein kinase C gamma (PKC gamma), a member of a family of 
      serine/threonine kinases. The entire coding region of PRKCG was sequenced in an 
      affected member of family AT08 and in a group of 39 unrelated patients with 
      ataxia not attributable to trinucleotide expansions. Three different 
      nonconservative missense mutations in highly conserved residues in C1, the 
      cysteine-rich region of the protein, were found in family AT08, another familial 
      case, and a sporadic case. The mutations cosegregated with disease in both 
      families. Structural modeling predicts that two of these amino acid substitutions 
      would severely abrogate the zinc-binding or phorbol ester-binding capabilities of 
      the protein. Immunohistochemical studies on cerebellar tissue from an affected 
      member of family AT08 demonstrated reduced staining for both PKC gamma and ataxin 
      1 in Purkinje cells, whereas staining for calbindin was preserved. These results 
      strongly support a new mechanism for neuronal cell dysfunction and death in 
      hereditary ataxias and suggest that there may be a common pathway for PKC 
      gamma-related and polyglutamine-related neurodegeneration.

TI  - SCA8 repeat expansion: large CTA/CTG repeat alleles are more common in ataxic 
      patients, including those with SCA6.
PG  - 704-9
AB  - We analyzed the SCA8 CTA/CTG repeat in a large group of Japanese subjects. The 
      frequency of large alleles (85-399 CTA/CTG repeats) was 1.9% in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA), 0.4% in Parkinson disease, 0.3% in Alzheimer disease, and 0% in a 
      healthy control group; the frequency was significantly higher in the group with 
      SCA than in the control group. Homozygotes for large alleles were observed only 
      in the group with SCA. In five patients with SCA from two families, a large SCA8 
      CTA/CTG repeat and a large SCA6 CAG repeat coexisted. Age at onset was correlated 
      with SCA8 repeats rather than SCA6 repeats in these five patients. In one of 
      these families, at least one patient showed only a large SCA8 CTA/CTG repeat 
      allele, with no large SCA6 CAG repeat allele. We speculate that the presence of a 
      large SCA8 CTA/CTG repeat allele influences the function of channels such as 
      alpha(1A)-voltage-dependent calcium channel through changing or aberrant 
      splicing, resulting in the development of cerebellar ataxia, especially in 
      homozygous patients.

TI  - Genomic context drives SCA7 CAG repeat instability, while expressed SCA7 cDNAs 
      are intergenerationally and somatically stable in transgenic mice.
PG  - 41-50
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin-7 gene. In humans, SCA7 is 
      characterized by marked anticipation due to intergenerational repeat instability 
      with a bias toward expansion, and is thus regarded as the most unstable of the 
      polyglutamine diseases. To study the molecular basis of CAG/CTG repeat 
      instability and its pathological significance, we generated lines of transgenic 
      mice carrying either a SCA7 cDNA construct or a 13.5 kb SCA7 genomic fragment 
      with 92 CAG repeats. While the cDNA transgenic mice showed little 
      intergenerational repeat instability, the genomic fragment transgenic mice 
      displayed marked intergenerational instability with an obvious expansion bias. We 
      then went on to generate additional lines of genomic fragment transgenic mice, 
      and observed that deletion of the 3' genomic region significantly stabilized 
      intergenerational transmission of the SCA7 CAG92 repeat. These results suggest 
      that cis-information present on the genomic fragment is driving the instability 
      process. As the SCA7 genomic fragment contains a large number of 
      replication-associated motifs, the presence of such sequence elements may make 
      the SCA7 CAG repeat region more susceptible to instability. Small-pool and 
      standard PCR analysis of tissues from genomic fragment mice revealed large repeat 
      expansions in their brains and livers, but no such changes were found in any 
      tissues from cDNA transgenic mice that have been shown to undergo 
      neurodegeneration. As large somatic repeat expansions are absent from the brains 
      of SCA7 cDNA mice, our results indicate that neurodegeneration can occur without 
      marked somatic mosaicism, at least in these mice.

TI  - SCA8 in the Spanish population including one homozygous patient.
PG  - 404-9
AB  - Controversial data have been reported about SCA8 since its description in 1999. 
      The most accepted hypothesis is that CTG expansions within the CTA/CTG combined 
      repeat expansion in the SCA8 locus causes SCA8. It is inherited as a dominant 
      trait with reduced penetrance. The present study, reports the first data 
      regarding SCA8 in the Spanish population and the clinical findings in patients 
      carrying expanded alleles, including one homozygous patient. Two hundred and 
      forty-six individuals from the Spanish population, including controls (149) and 
      ataxic patients (97), were studied. DNA was extracted from blood samples using 
      standard methods. Amplification of the CTA/CTG 3'untranslated region was achieved 
      by PCR using primers SCA8-F3 and SCA8-R4 and conditions described previously. 
      Neurological reevaluation was done in individuals carrying the expanded allele. 
      We detected five unrelated expanded alleles corresponding to three affected 
      patients (one of them homozygous) and one healthy individual. SCA8 represents 4% 
      of the total dominant spinocerebellar ataxias studied in our group (Spanish 
      population) (three index patients out of 75 dominant ataxic independent nucleus). 
      The patient that resulted homozygous for the expansion is a 25-year-old man with 
      a clinical picture of progressive ataxia and dysarthria that began at the age of 
      12. On neurological examination, he showed ataxia, slight dysarthria and 
      nystagmus to the extreme lateral gaze. A cranial MRI showed global atrophy of 
      cerebellum but the brainstem was spared. Family history showed the presence of 
      ataxia in his grandfather and father. His mother is healthy at the age of 52 and 
      a molecular study of SCA8 reveals one allele that could be considered as 
      premutated. She has no ataxia antecedents in her family. Our results provide 
      additional information about the SCA8 expansion, within the Spanish population. 
      These results are in agreement with the hypothesis of the CTG expansion in the 
      SCA8 locus being responsible for the SCA8 ataxia showing reduced penetrance. 
      Besides homozygous status, advancing age at onset (as previously described for 
      other SCAs) supports this idea.

TI  - Genetic and clinical analysis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 repeat expansion 
      in Yugoslavia.
PG  - 321-4
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a slowly progressive ataxia causally 
      associated with untranslated CTG repeat expansion on chromosome 13q21. However, 
      the role of the CTG repeat in SCA8 pathology is not yet well understood. 
      Therefore, we studied the length of the SCA8 CTA/CTG expansions (combined 
      repeats, CRs) in 115 patients with ataxia, 64 unrelated individuals with 
      non-triplet neuromuscular diseases, 70 unrelated patients with schizophrenia, and 
      125 healthy controls. Only one patient with apparently sporadic ataxia was 
      identified with an expansion of 100 CRs. He had inherited the expansion from his 
      asymptomatic father (140 CRs) and transmitted the mutation to his son (92 CRs). 
      Paternal transmission in this family produced contractions of 40 and 8 CRs, 
      respectively. None of the subjects from other studied groups had an expansion at 
      the SCA8 locus. In the control group the number of CRs at the SCA8 locus ranged 
      from 14 to 34. Our findings support the notion that allelic variants of the 
      expansion mutation at the SCA8 locus can predispose to ataxia.

TI  - Clinical features and ATTCT repeat expansion in spinocerebellar ataxia type 10.
PG  - 1285-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10, an autosomal dominant disease 
      characterized by ataxia and seizures, is caused by a large expansion of an 
      unstable ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the phenotypic 
      expression of spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 and to examine the 
      genotype-phenotype correlations in 2 large families. DESIGN: Clinical 
      characterization and genotype-phenotype correlation. SETTING: Studies at 2 
      medical schools with private practice referral. PATIENTS: Twenty-two affected 
      individuals from 2 large Mexican American pedigrees. RESULTS: Of the 22 
      individuals, ataxia was the initial symptom in 21; seizure disorders developed in 
      11, mostly within several years following the onset of ataxia. The seizure 
      frequency was different in the 2 families: 3 (25%) of 12 had seizures in family 
      1, and 8 (80%) of 10 had seizures in family 2 (P =.01). A brain magnetic 
      resonance imaging or computed tomographic scan showed cerebellar atrophy in all 
      patients examined. An electroencephalogram demonstrated epileptiform discharges 
      in 4 of 8 patients studied. Although anticipation was apparent in both families, 
      only family 1 showed a strong inverse correlation between age of onset and repeat 
      number (r(2) = 0.79, P =.001). In family 1, 8 transmissions, of which 7 were 
      paternal, resulted in an average gain of 1940 repeats. In contrast, despite 
      anticipation, 2 affected male subjects transmitted their expanded alleles to 8 
      progenies, with an average loss of 755 repeats, in family 2. CONCLUSIONS: Seizure 
      is an integral part of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 phenotype, with 
      documented morbidity and mortality. Family-dependent factors may alter the 
      frequency of the seizure phenotype and the pattern of intergenerational repeat 
      size changes, making the genotype-phenotype correlation complex.

AB  - To obtain novel candidate genes for autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia and 
      other neurodegenerative disorders in which gene mutations remain unidentified, we 
      screened a human fetal brain cDNA library using (CAG)(10) repeat probes. Sixteen 
      cDNAs were isolated and mapped to chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 13, 15, 16, 22, and 
      X. Although we failed to detect abnormal CAG repeat expansion within these genes 
      in Japanese patients with inherited neurodegenerative diseases, these genes 
      remain potential candidate genes for neurodegenerative diseases that feature 
      anticipation.

TI  - Changes of cortical excitability of human motor cortex in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 2. A study with paired transcranial magnetic stimulation.
PG  - 87-92
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate motor cortex excitability in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). Cortical silent period (CSP), motor 
      thresholds, and intracortical inhibition and facilitation by paired transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) were investigated in 18 SCA2 patients and in 20 
      controls. The mean CSP duration and motor threshold after TMS were significantly 
      increased in the patient group. Intracortical inhibition by paired TMS at short 
      interstimulus intervals (ISIs) showed no significant differences between patients 
      and controls; at longer ISIs, the expected facilitation of test responses, 
      observed in control subjects, resulted significantly less marked in SCA2 patients 
      at all the tested intervals. Our findings extend previous findings on cerebellar 
      dysfunctions of varying aetiologies by investigating intracortical excitability 
      in SCA2. In addition, this study demonstrates that the cortical excitability 
      involvement found in SCA2 is independent on the cytosine-adenine-guanine repeat 
      expansion. The neurophysiological alterations seen in our patients relate to the 
      worsening of general clinical condition. Thus, we might speculate that changes of 
      motor cortex excitability in SCA2 represent a slow neurodegenerative process 
      characterized by gradual loss of cerebellar neurons leading to an increasing 
      disturbance of the balance between inhibitory and excitatory circuits in the 
      motor system.

TI  - A simple method for the detection of neurologic disorders associated with CAG 
      repeat expansion using PCR-microtiter plate hybridization.
PG  - 215-23
AB  - A new screening method was developed for the detection of CAG expanded alleles in 
      patients with hereditary ataxia using polymerase chain reaction-based microtiter 
      plate hybridization (PCR-MPH). The system can be applied to detect pathologic 
      alleles by hybridization with the immobilized (CAG)48 repeat probe derived from 
      the unrelated gene 'ERDA1' except for the CAG repeats. We examined 10 individuals 
      with SCA3, 10 with Huntington disease and 30 normal controls (31 controls for 
      SCA3) using this method. The results showed that a clear discrimination was 
      possible in all cases. We suggest that this system be made available for mass 
      screening of patients with hereditary ataxia disorders. This report is the first 
      to demonstrate that a PCR-MPH system can be successfully applied to DNA size 
      differentiation in addition to base pair mismatches. Also, our design of the 
      probe is unique in that the probe motif stem from the unrelated gene sequence and 
      not from the synthetic oligonucleotides.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias in the Netherlands: prevalence and age at onset variance 
      analysis.
PG  - 702-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: International prevalence estimates of autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxias (ADCA) vary from 0.3 to 2.0 per 100,000. The prevalence of ADCA in the 
      Netherlands is unknown. Fifteen genetic loci have been identified (SCA-1-8, 
      SCA-10-14, SCA-16, and SCA-17) and nine of the corresponding genes have been 
      cloned. In SCA-1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA-12 and SCA-17 the mutation has been 
      shown to be an expanded CAG repeat. Previously, the length of the CAG repeat was 
      found to account for 50 to 80% of variance in age at onset. Because of 
      heterogeneity in encoded proteins, different pathophysiologic mechanisms leading 
      to neurodegeneration could be involved. The relationship between CAG repeat 
      length and age at onset would then differ accordingly. METHOD: Based on the 
      results of SCA mutation analysis in the three DNA diagnostic laboratories that 
      serve the entire Dutch population, the authors surveyed the number of families 
      and affected individuals per SCA gene, as well as individual repeat length and 
      age at onset. Regression analysis was applied to study the relationship between 
      CAG repeat length and age at onset per SCA gene. The slopes of the different 
      regression curves were compared. RESULTS: On November 1, 2000, mutations were 
      found in 145 ADCA families and 391 affected individuals were identified. The 
      authors extrapolated a minimal prevalence of 3.0 per 100,000 (range 2.8 to 
      3.8/100,000). SCA3 was the most frequent mutation. CAG repeat length contributed 
      to 52 to 76% of age at onset variance. Regression curve slopes for SCA-1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, and SCA7 did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated minimal 
      prevalence of ADCA in the Netherlands is 3.0 per 100,000 inhabitants. Except for 
      SCA6, the relationship between age at onset and CAG repeat expansion does not 
      differ significantly between SCA-1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA7 patient groups in our 
      population, indicating that these SCA subtypes share similar mechanisms of 
      polyglutamine-induced neurotoxicity, despite heterogeneity in gene products.

TI  - Spastic paraplegia, ataxia, mental retardation (SPAR): a novel genetic disorder.
PG  - 411-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a kindred with a dominantly inherited neurologic disorder 
      manifested either as uncomplicated spastic paraplegia or ataxia, spastic 
      paraplegia, and mental retardation. METHODS: Neurologic examinations and 
      molecular genetic analysis (exclusion of known SCA and HSP genes and loci; and 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion detection [RED]) were performed in six affected 
      and four unaffected subjects in this family. MRI, electromyography (EMG), and 
      nerve conduction studies were performed in three affected subjects. RESULTS: The 
      phenotype of this dominantly inherited syndrome varied in succeeding generations. 
      Pure spastic paraplegia was present in the earliest generation; subsequent 
      generations had ataxia and mental retardation. MRI showed marked atrophy of the 
      spinal cord in all patients and cerebellar atrophy in those with ataxia. 
      Laboratory analysis showed that the disorder was not caused by mutations in genes 
      that cause SCA-1, SCA-2, SCA-3, SCA-6, SCA-7, SCA-8, and SCA-12; not linked to 
      other known loci for autosomal dominant ataxia (SCA-4, SCA-5, SCA-10, SCA-11, 
      SCA-13, SCA-14, and SCA-16); and not linked to known loci for autosomal dominant 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (SPG-3, SPG-4, SPG-6, SPG-8, SPG-9, SPG-10, 
      SPG-12, and SPG-13) or autosomal recessive HSP SPG-7. Analysis of 
      intergenerational differences in age at onset of symptoms suggests genetic 
      anticipation. Using RED, the authors did not detect expanded CAG, CCT, TGG, or 
      CGT repeats that segregate with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The authors describe an 
      unusual, dominantly inherited neurologic disorder in which the phenotype (pure 
      spastic paraplegia or spastic ataxia with variable mental retardation) differed 
      in subsequent generations. The molecular explanation for apparent genetic 
      anticipation does not appear to involve trinucleotide repeat expansion.

TI  - Is the 31 CAG repeat allele of the spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) gene locus 
      non-specifically associated with trinucleotide expansion diseases?
PG  - 201-5
AB  - A number of human hereditary neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders are 
      caused by the expansion of trinucleotide repeats within certain genes. The 
      molecular mechanisms that underlie these expansions are not yet known. We have 
      analyzed six trinucleotide repeat-containing loci [spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, 
      SCA3, SCA8), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), Huntington chorea (HD) 
      and fragile X syndrome (FRAXA)] in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients (n = 
      52). As controls, we analyzed two groups of subjects: healthy control subjects (n 
      =133), and a group of patients with non-triplet neuromuscular diseases (n = 68) 
      caused by point mutations, deletions or duplications (spinal muscular atrophy, 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 1A, hereditary neuropathy with liability to 
      pressure palsies, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy). Allele frequency 
      distributions for all tested loci were similar in these three groups with the 
      exception of the SCA1 locus. In DM1 patients, the SCA1 allele with 31 CAG repeats 
      account for 40.4% of all chromosomes tested, which is significantly higher than 
      in two other groups (11.3% in healthy controls and 6.6% in the group of 
      non-triplet diseased patients; P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). This is 
      consistent with our previous findings in HD patients. The absence of this 
      association in non-triplet diseases as well as in healthy controls could indicate 
      a possible role of this SCA1 allele with 31 repeats in triplet diseases. Here we 
      discuss a possible role of the SCA1 region in pathological trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions.

TI  - Molecular analysis of Spinocerebellar ataxias in Koreans: frequencies and 
      reference ranges of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7.
PG  - 336-41
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. CAG repeat expansions in the causative genes have been identified as 
      the basic cause of several types of SCAs, and have been used for the diagnoses 
      and classifications of patients with ataxia. In order to assess the frequency and 
      CAG repeat size ranges of SCAs, and to establish an effective strategy for 
      molecular diagnosis, we performed a molecular analysis of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      and SCA7 in 76 patients. These patients were as follows: 32 with dominant 
      inheritance, 39 sporadic cases, and 5 with unknown family histories. The normal 
      and affected CAG repeat size ranges were established at five SCA loci in Koreans, 
      which was consistent with previous reports. The total prevalence of the five 
      types of SCAs was 39.5% in the 76 patients with ataxia, regardless of their 
      family history. It was 75.0% in the 32 families with a dominant inheritance. The 
      most frequent type was SCA3 (15.8%), followed by SCA2 (14.5%). Both types 
      combined formed 76.7% of the 30 patients with CAG expansions. SCA1, SCA6, and 
      SCA7 were less frequent, affecting 3.9%, 2.6%, and 2.6% of the cases, 
      respectively. This mutation spectrum is quite different from a previous report 
      concerning Koreans, but is similar to the distributions that are seen in several 
      ethnic populations worldwide. For a correct and effective diagnosis of SCAs, we 
      suggest that a molecular diagnosis be undertaken, even in patients without a 
      family history, as well as those with a family history. A stepwise approach is 
      also recommended. Patients with ataxia should be tested for SCA2 and SCA3. 
      Individuals testing negative should be tested for SCA1, SCA6, and SCA7.

TI  - Ophthalmological findings in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 are not 
      correlated with neurological anticipation.
PG  - 722-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Optic atrophy, attenuation of the oscillatory potentials (OPs) of the 
      electroretinogram (ERG), and enlargement of corneal endothelial cells, have been 
      reported in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). These patients 
      have a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the SCA1 gene and show neurological 
      anticipation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the 
      ophthalmological findings are correlated with the neurological disorders, and 
      whether ophthalmological anticipation is present in patients with SCA1. METHODS: 
      The visual acuity, ERGs, and corneal endothelial cell density were examined in 14 
      patients whose DNA analysis revealed an expanded trinucleotide repeat in an 
      allele of the SCA1 gene. The results of the tests were compared with the 
      trinucleotide repeat number and the duration of the neuronal disease. RESULTS: 
      The neurological disorders in the patients showed anticipation. The negative 
      correlation between the trinucleotide repeat number and the neurological disorder 
      was statistically significant (P<0.0001). However, the correlations between 
      trinucleotide repeat number and visual acuity, amplitude of OPs, and corneal 
      endothelial cell density were not significant. Statistically significant 
      correlations were found between the duration of the neuronal disease and the 
      visual acuity, OPs, and corneal endothelial cell density (P<0.0001, P=0.0004, and 
      P<0.0001, respectively). The ophthalmological disorders were prominent in 
      patients who had neuronal disease for more than 10 years. CONCLUSION: Unlike the 
      neurological findings, the ophthalmological disorders in patients with SCA1 were 
      not correlated with the trinucleotide repeat number of the SCA1 gene. The 
      ophthalmological findings were most highly correlated with the duration of the 
      neuronal disease.

TI  - Clinical and genetic analysis of hereditary and sporadic ataxia in central Italy.
PG  - 363-6
AB  - We have clinically and genetically evaluated 24 affected patients belonging to 22 
      Italian Friedreich ataxia (FA) families, 52 patients from 32 kindreds with proven 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA), 9 patients belonging to 5 families 
      with autosomal recessive hereditary ataxia (ARCA) and 103 sporadic cases, 89 of 
      which affected by idiopathic late onset cerebellar ataxia (ILOCA). 
      Genotype-phenotype correlation analyses in FA patients have evidenced an inverse 
      relationship between GAA repeat expansion length and age of onset, disease 
      duration, and presence of cardiomyopathy. Among autosomal dominant types, 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) genotype has been found in 31% of our ADCA 
      families, resulting the most frequent form of ataxia. Phenotypic analysis of the 
      various SCA subtypes evidenced a marked heterogeneity of symptoms with a 
      substantial overlap between different syndromes.

TI  - Increased expression of alpha 1A Ca2+ channel currents arising from expanded 
      trinucleotide repeats in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 9185-93
AB  - The expansion of polyglutamine tracts encoded by CAG trinucleotide repeats is a 
      common mutational mechanism in inherited neurodegenerative diseases. 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), an autosomal dominant, progressive disease, 
      arises from trinucleotide repeat expansions present in the coding region of 
      CACNA1A (chromosome 19p13). This gene encodes alpha(1A), the principal subunit of 
      P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels, which are abundant in the CNS, particularly in 
      cerebellar Purkinje and granule neurons. We assayed ion channel function by 
      introduction of human alpha(1A) cDNAs in human embryonic kidney 293 cells that 
      stably coexpressed beta(1) and alpha(2)delta subunits. Immunocytochemical 
      analysis showed a rise in intracellular and surface expression of alpha(1A) 
      protein when CAG repeat lengths reached or exceeded the pathogenic range for 
      SCA6. This gain at the protein level was not a consequence of changes in RNA 
      stability, as indicated by Northern blot analysis. The electrophysiological 
      behavior of alpha(1A) subunits containing expanded (EXP) numbers of CAG repeats 
      (23, 27, and 72) was compared against that of wild-type subunits (WT) (4 and 11 
      repeats) using standard whole-cell patch-clamp recording conditions. The EXP 
      alpha(1A) subunits yielded functional ion channels that supported inward Ca(2+) 
      channel currents, with a sharp increase in P/Q Ca(2+) channel current density 
      relative to WT. Our results showed that Ca(2+) channels from SCA6 patients 
      display near-normal biophysical properties but increased current density 
      attributable to elevated protein expression at the cell surface.

TI  - Genetic and clinical analysis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 repeat expansion 
      in Italy.
PG  - 1856-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are clinically heterogeneous 
      disorders caused by triplet repeat expansions in the sequence of specific disease 
      genes. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8), originally described in a family 
      characterized by pure cerebellar ataxia with slow disease progression, presents 
      with expansion of combined CTA/CTG repeats. OBJECTIVE: To perform SCA8 repeat 
      expansion analysis in a heterogeneous group of ataxic patients, to determine the 
      prevalence of this mutation in our patients and establish the frequency of 
      expanded CTA/CTG repeats in a large group of control subjects. PATIENTS: One 
      hundred sixty-seven patients affected by sporadic, autosomal dominant and 
      recessive hereditary ataxia were clinically examined and analyzed for SCA8 
      expansion. We further studied 161 control subjects and 125 patients with 
      psychiatric disorders. RESULTS: We found abnormally expanded CTA/CTG repeats in 5 
      ataxic patients, 3 of them characterized by pure cerebellar ataxia. One patient 
      had vitamin E deficiency and 1 patient with a sporadic case was affected by 
      gluten ataxia. No evidence of expanded alleles was found in healthy control 
      subjects and in patients with psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Our data 
      support the evidence that CTG expansions may be linked to SCA8, since the 
      pathogenic expansions have been found only among patients with genetically 
      unidentified forms of hereditary and sporadic ataxia. Patients carrying expanded 
      alleles present peculiar phenotypic features, thus suggesting that unknown 
      additional factors could probably predispose to the disease.

TI  - Clinical and molecular correlations in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6: a study of 
      24 Dutch families.
PG  - 1839-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs), or spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCAs), are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders. Mild 
      CAG repeat expansions in the alpha(1A) voltage-dependent calcium channel gene are 
      associated with SCA type 6 (SCA6). OBJECTIVE: To obtain further insight into the 
      contribution of SCA6 mutations to the phenotypic variability in Dutch patients 
      with ataxia. DESIGN: Survey and case series. SETTING: Hospitalized care, referral 
      center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The SCA6 locus was analyzed for CAG repeat 
      expansions in a referred sample of 220 Dutch families with progressive cerebellar 
      ataxia. Clinical characteristics of patients with SCA6 were investigated and 
      correlated with molecular findings. RESULTS: The diagnosis SCA6 was confirmed in 
      24 families comprising 30 familial and 4 sporadic cases. Mean +/- SD age at onset 
      was 50.1 +/- 11.1 years. Expanded CAG repeats with sizes 22, 23, and 25 were 
      found. These sizes correlated inversely with age at onset. No intergenerational 
      changes in CAG repeat size were detected. Despite this, 2 families showed 
      clinical anticipation. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first detailed 
      description of Dutch patients with SCA6. Clinical analysis identifies SCA6 as a 
      late-onset ataxia in which eye movement abnormalities are prominent and 
      consistent early manifestations. No single clinical sign can be considered 
      specific for SCA6. Some patients have ataxia combined with episodic headaches or 
      nausea, suggesting an overlap among SCA6, eposidic ataxia type 2, and familial 
      hemiplegic migraine. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 accounts for approximately 11% 
      of all Dutch families with ADCA. Analysis of SCA6 contributes further to the 
      genetic classification of patients with ADCA, including patients without a clear 
      family history of the disease.

TI  - SCA8 repeat expansions in ataxia: a controversial association.
PG  - 1310-2
AB  - The observation of large SCA8 alleles in healthy control subjects and nonataxic 
      patients, together with a lack of segregation of the expanded repeat with ataxia 
      in several families, has raised questions about the pathogenic role of the SCA8 
      expansion. The authors found allele sizes within the proposed pathogenic range in 
      three patients with ataxia of unknown etiology, in two individuals from pedigrees 
      with either SCA2 or Friedreich's ataxia, and in two patients with Alzheimer's 
      disease. Sizing of SCA8 alleles should not be a routine diagnostic test until its 
      etiologic role is clarified and the pathogenic threshold is determined.

TI  - Polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-7 antagonizes CRX function and induces cone-rod 
      dystrophy in a mouse model of SCA7.
PG  - 913-27
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by 
      a CAG repeat expansion. To determine the mechanism of neurotoxicity, we produced 
      transgenic mice and observed a cone-rod dystrophy. Nuclear inclusions were 
      present, suggesting that the disease pathway involves the nucleus. When yeast 
      two-hybrid assays indicated that cone-rod homeobox protein (CRX) interacts with 
      ataxin-7, we performed further studies to assess this interaction. We found that 
      ataxin-7 and CRX colocalize and coimmunoprecipitate. We observed that 
      polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-7 can dramatically suppress CRX transactivation. In 
      SCA7 transgenic mice, electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated reduced CRX 
      binding activity, while RT-PCR analysis detected reductions in CRX-regulated 
      genes. Our results suggest that CRX transcription interference accounts for the 
      retinal degeneration in SCA7 and thus may provide an explanation for how 
      cell-type specificity is achieved in this polyglutamine repeat disease.

TI  - Single cell analysis of CAG repeat in brains of dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA).
PG  - 87-93
AB  - Somatic mosaicism of an expanded repeat is present in tissues of patients with 
      triplet repeat diseases. Of the spinocerebellar ataxias associated with triplet 
      repeat expansion, the most prominent heterogeneity of the expanded repeat is seen 
      in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The common feature of this 
      somatic mosaicism is the difference in the repeat numbers found in the cerebellum 
      as compared to other tissues. The expanded allele in the cerebellum shows a 
      smaller degree of expansion. We previously showed by microdissection analysis 
      that the expanded allele in the granular layer in DRPLA cerebellum has less 
      expansion than expanded alleles in the molecular layer and white matter. Whether 
      this feature of lesser expansion in granule cells is common to other types of 
      neurons is yet to be clarified. We used a newly developed excimer laser 
      microdissection system to analyze somatic mosaicism in the brains of two 
      patients, one with early- and another with late-onset DRPLA, and used single cell 
      PCR to observe the cell-to-cell differences in repeat numbers. In the late onset 
      patient, repeat expansion was more prominent in Purkinje cells than in granule 
      cells, but less than that in the glial cells. In the early onset patient, repeat 
      expansion in Purkinje cells was greater than in granule cells but did not differ 
      from that in glial cells. These findings suggest that there is a difference in 
      repeat expansion among neuronal subgroups and that the number of cell division 
      cycles is not the only determinant of somatic mosaicism.

TI  - Inflammatory genes are upregulated in expanded ataxin-3-expressing cell lines and 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 brains.
PG  - 5389-96
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a polyglutamine disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the coding region of a gene encoding ataxin-3. To study 
      putative alterations of gene expression induced by expanded ataxin-3, we 
      performed PCR-based cDNA subtractive hybridization in a cell culture model of 
      SCA3. In rat mesencephalic CSM14.1 cells stably expressing expanded ataxin-3, we 
      found a significant upregulation of mRNAs encoding the endopeptidase matrix 
      metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), the transmembrane protein amyloid precursor protein, 
      the interleukin-1 receptor-related Fos-inducible transcript, and the cytokine 
      stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF1alpha). Immunohistochemical studies of 
      the corresponding or associated proteins in human SCA3 brain tissue confirmed 
      these findings, showing increased expression of MMP-2 and amyloid beta-protein 
      (Abeta) in pontine neurons containing nuclear inclusions. In addition, 
      extracellular Abeta-immunoreactive deposits were detected in human SCA3 pons. 
      Furthermore, pontine neurons of SCA3 brains strongly expressed the 
      antiinflammatory interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, the proinflammatory cytokine 
      interleukin-1beta, and the proinflammatory chemokine SDF1. Finally, increased 
      numbers of reactive astrocytes and activated microglial cells were found in SCA3 
      pons. These results suggest that inflammatory processes are involved in the 
      pathogenesis of SCA3.

TI  - Neurologic findings in Machado-Joseph disease: relation with disease duration, 
      subtypes, and (CAG)n.
PG  - 899-904
AB  - CONTEXT: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      degeneration caused by an expanded CAG repeat on chromosome 14q32.1, is a 
      heterogeneous disorder for clinical manifestations. The reasons for the wide 
      range of neurologic findings in this disease are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To 
      explain part of this heterogeneity through the association of the neurologic 
      findings with sex, disease duration, age of onset, clinical type, and size of CAG 
      repeat expansion. DESIGN: A case-control study. SETTING: Ambulatory care. 
      PATIENTS: A consecutive sample of 62 patients with MJD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: 
      Neurologic signs. RESULTS: A direct relationship was found between the disease 
      duration and severity of gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia, 
      fasciculations, pyramidal syndrome, and ophthalmoplegia (P<.02). The most severe 
      forms of nuclear ophthalmoplegia were associated with type 1 MJD, whereas those 
      of supranuclear ophthalmoplegia were associated with type 3 MJD (P<.001). It was 
      also found that higher mean (CAG)(n) lengths were associated with worse degrees 
      of the pyramidal syndrome and dystonia (P<.001). The presence and severity of 
      nystagmus, eyelid retraction, rigidity and/or bradykinesia, and optic atrophy 
      were not clearly associated with any of the predictive variables under study. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Disease duration can explain part of the heterogeneity of ataxia, 
      dysarthria, dysphagia, fasciculations, pyramidal syndrome, and ophthalmoplegia, 
      in MJD. Type 1 MJD was positively associated with nuclear ophthalmoplegia; type 3 
      MJD was positively associated with supranuclear ophthalmoplegia. Higher mean CAG 
      lengths were found to correlate with the pyramidal syndrome and dystonia. 
      Nystagmus, eyelid retraction, rigidity and/or bradykinesia, and optic atrophy 
      were hardly attributable to any known reason or variable.

TI  - Retinopathy associated with Machado--Joseph disease (spinocerebellar ataxia 3) 
      with CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion.
PG  - 808-10
AB  - PURPOSE: To report characteristic atrophic maculopathy in a patient with 
      Machado--Joseph disease (spinocerebellar ataxia 3) caused by trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion of the relevant gene. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 64-year-old 
      Japanese man had suffered from slurred speech and gait disturbance since 57 years 
      of age. Cerebellar ataxia, extensor plantar response, and other neurological 
      signs were compatible with features of Machado--Joseph disease. Magnetic 
      resonance imaging showed atrophies of cerebellum and cerebral cortex. Family 
      history suggested an autosomal dominant inheritance of the disease. The patient 
      presented with gaze-evoked nystagmus and limitations of eye movement in all 
      directions. Ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiogram revealed symmetric changes 
      in the posterior fundi, which consisted of patchy atrophies at the level of the 
      retinal pigment epithelium. Scotopic electroretinogram showed no abnormalities 
      with normal oscillatory potentials. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the 
      Machado--Joseph disease gene identified a heterozygous trinucleotide (CAG) repeat 
      expansion. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates a rare association of atrophic 
      maculopathy and external ophthalmoplegia in Machado--Joseph disease, contrasted 
      with the common occurrence of retinal degeneration in spinocerebellar ataxia 7. 
      Dystrophic changes in the retinal pigment epithelium have rarely been described 
      but may be one of the characteristic complications of Machado--Joseph disease.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 in China: molecular analysis and genotype-phenotype 
      correlation in 5 families.
PG  - 789-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Twelve genetic types of autosomal dominant hereditary ataxia have 
      been recently identified and the genes responsible for most of them cloned. 
      Molecular identification of the type of ataxia is important to determine the 
      disease prevalence and its natural history in various populations. OBJECTIVES: To 
      perform molecular analysis of 75 Chinese families affected with spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) and to evaluate the spectrum of mutations in these genes and the 
      correlation between genotypes and phenotypes in Chinese patients. SETTING: 
      Neurogenetics Unit, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China. METHODS: One 
      hundred nine patients from 75 kindreds diagnosed as having autosomal dominant 
      SCA, 16 patients with sporadic SCA or spastic paraplegia, 280 control chromosomes 
      of the Chinese population, and 120 control chromosomes of the Sakha population 
      were selected for this study. We conducted detailed mutational analysis by direct 
      sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products amplified from genomic DNA. 
      RESULTS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) was identified in 5 families with 
      12 studied patients. All affected family members were heterozygous for a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the SCA1 gene containing 51 to 64 trinucleotide repeats. 
      Normal alleles had 26 to 35 repeats. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 accounted for 
      7% of the studied Chinese families with ataxia. In addition, we determined the 
      frequency of a single vs double CAT interruption in 120 control chromosomes of 
      the Siberian Sakha population, which has the highest known prevalence of SCA1, 
      and compared this with 280 control chromosomes from the Chinese populations. The 
      results show that 64.7% of the Siberian normal alleles contain a single CAT 
      interruption, whereas 92% of the Chinese had more than 1 interruption. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 is responsible for 7% of affected 
      families in the Chinese population. A correlation between the prevalence of SCA1 
      and the number of CAT interruptions in the trinucleotide chain suggests that a 
      CAT-to-CAG substitution may have been the initial event contributing to the 
      generation of expanded alleles and influencing relative prevalence of SCA1.

TI  - Clinical features and genetic analysis of a new form of spinocerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 234-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically 
      heterogeneous group of disorders. The mutations for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, and SCA-12 are identified and caused by an expansion of a CAG or a CTG 
      repeat sequence of these genes. Six additional loci for SCA4, SCA5, SCA-10, 
      SCA-11, SCA-13, and SCA-14 are mapped. The growing heterogeneity of the autosomal 
      dominant forms of these diseases shows that the genetic etiologies of at least 
      20% of ADCA have yet to be elucidated. METHODS: The authors ascertained and 
      clinically characterized a four-generation pedigree segregating an autosomal 
      dominant phenotype for SCA. Direct mutation analysis, repeat expansion detection 
      analysis, and linkage analysis for all known SCA loci were performed. RESULTS: 
      Direct mutational analysis excluded SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 12; genetic linkage 
      analysis excluded SCA4, 5,10, 11, 13, and 14, giving significant negative lod 
      scores. Examination of the family showed that all affected members had gait 
      ataxia and akinesia with variable features of dysarthria, hyporeflexia, and mild 
      intellectual impairment. Eye movements were normal. Head MRI showed atrophy of 
      the cerebellum without involvement of the brainstem. In 10 parent-child pairs, 
      median onset occurred 10.5 years earlier in offspring than in their parents, 
      suggesting anticipation. CONCLUSION: This family is distinct from other families 
      with SCA and is characterized by cerebellar ataxia and extrapyramidal signs.

TI  - Detection of triplet repeat expansion in the human genome by use of hybridization 
      signal intensity.
PG  - 59-66
AB  - Triplet repeat disease is a group of hereditary neurodegenerative disorders 
      caused by expansion of trinucleotide repeats such as CAG/CTG, CGG/CCG, and 
      GAA/TTC. Direct detection of the expansion in the patient's genome shortcuts the 
      tedious process needed for identification of disease genes by conventional 
      approaches. Here we describe a method to detect triplet repeat expansion from the 
      hybridization signal intensity. Using a digoxigenin-labeled (CTG)9 probe, the 
      hybridization intensity and number of repeats showed a good linear correlation. 
      The technique detected expansion in genomic DNA in all cases with moderate or 
      large expansion. Even in the case of a small expansion, this method could detect 
      the mutant fragment. The technique has advantages over related techniques because 
      it is more sensitive and can be applied to cases where a small repeat expansion 
      is involved.

TI  - Macular degeneration associated with aberrant expansion of trinucleotide repeat 
      of the SCA7 gene in 2 Japanese families.
PG  - 1415-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the macular function of Japanese patients with a 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) gene. 
      METHODS: Ophthalmic findings in patients whose DNA analysis revealed expanded 
      alleles of the trinucleotide repeat in the SCA7 gene were evaluated. RESULTS: 
      Trinucleotide repeat was expanded from 40 to 48 in affected patients (control 
      subjects, 12 repeats). Affected patients were characterized by different degrees 
      of visual acuity decrease (0.09-0.9), a tritan axis color vision, a coarse 
      granular appearance of the macular region on scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, 
      depression of multifocal electroretinograms, and macular degeneration. However, 
      pigmentary changes were not observed in the retina. The trinucleotide repeat was 
      longer and the onset of macular dysfunction was earlier in the younger 
      generation. One patient in a family manifested decreased visual acuity 10 years 
      preceding other neurologic signs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Patients 
      with SCA7 mutations showed macular dysfunction or degeneration with expansion of 
      CAG repeat in the SCA7 gene. However, the lesions were less pigmented than those 
      previously reported. Patients also showed ophthalmologic anticipation, which has 
      not been reported for the ocular changes in other patients who have trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion of the responsible genes.

TI  - Genetic background of apparently idiopathic sporadic cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 132-7
AB  - Disease-causing mutations have been identified in various entities of autosomal 
      dominant ataxia and in Friedreich's ataxia. However, no molecular pathogenic 
      factor is known to cause idiopathic cerebellar ataxias. We investigated the 
      CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats causing spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 
      8 and 12, and the GAA repeat of the frataxin gene in 124 patients apparently 
      suffering from idiopathic sporadic ataxia, including 20 patients with the 
      clinical diagnosis of multiple system atrophy. Patients with a positive family 
      history, a typical Friedreich phenotype, or symptomatic ataxia were excluded. 
      Genetic analyses uncovered the most common Friedreich mutation in 10 patients 
      with an age at onset between 13 and 36 years. The SCA6 mutation was present in 
      nine patients with disease onset between 47 and 68 years of age. The CTG repeat 
      associated with SCA8 was expanded in three patients. One patient had SCA2 
      attributable to a de novo mutation from a paternally transmitted, intermediate 
      allele. We did not identify the SCA1, SCA3, SCA7 or SCA12 mutation in idiopathic 
      sporadic ataxia patients. No trinucleotide repeat expansion was detected in the 
      MSA subgroup. This study has revealed the genetic basis in 19% of apparently 
      idiopathic ataxia patients. SCA6 is the most frequent mutation in late onset 
      cerebellar ataxia. The frataxin trinucleotide expansion should be investigated in 
      all sporadic ataxia patients with onset before age 40, even when the phenotype is 
      atypical for Friedreich's ataxia.

TI  - Large expansion of the ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 10.
PG  - 191-4
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10; MIM 603516; refs 1,2) is an autosomal 
      dominant disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia and seizures. The gene SCA10 
      maps to a 3.8-cM interval on human chromosome 22q13-qter (refs 1,2). Because 
      several other SCA subtypes show trinucleotide repeat expansions, we examined 
      microsatellites in this region. We found an expansion of a pentanucleotide 
      (ATTCT) repeat in intron 9 of SCA10 in all patients in five Mexican SCA10 
      families. There was an inverse correlation between the expansion size, up to 22.5 
      kb larger than the normal allele, and the age of onset (r2=0.34, P=0.018). 
      Analysis of 562 chromosomes from unaffected individuals of various ethnic origins 
      (including 242 chromosomes from Mexican persons) showed a range of 10 to 22 ATTCT 
      repeats with no evidence of expansions. Our data indicate that the new SCA10 
      intronic ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat in SCA10 patients is unstable and 
      represents the largest microsatellite expansion found so far in the human genome.

TI  - Morphological Purkinje cell changes in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 371-6
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) was recently identified as a form of 
      autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia associated with a small CAG repeat 
      expansion of the gene encoding an alpha 1 A-voltage-dependent calcium channel 
      gene subunit on chromosome 19p13. In this study 50-microm-thick sections of 
      cerebellar tissue from one patient with SCA6 were subjected to free-floating 
      immunohistochemical staining with calbindin-D and parvalbumin antibodies. Severe 
      loss of Purkinje cells was found, particularly in the vermis, and various 
      morphological changes in Purkinje cells and their dendritic arborizations were 
      demonstrated. Many of the remaining Purkinje cells were found to have 
      heterotopic, irregularly shaped nuclei, an unclear cytoplasmic membrane outline, 
      and somatic sprouts. Increased numbers of spine-like protrusions from swelling 
      dendritic arborizations were found in the molecular layer. The axonal arrangement 
      was disordered, and many torpedos were found in the granular layer and white 
      matters. These morphological changes are completely different from those observed 
      in paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) 
      and are considered to be related to the genetic abnormality that causes abnormal 
      development of Purkinje cells.

TI  - Clinical and genetic findings in Finnish ataxia patients with the spinocerebellar 
      ataxia 8 repeat expansion.
PG  - 354-61
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 8 (SCA8) is caused by a CTG repeat expansion in an 
      untranslated region of a recently cloned gene on 13q21. The pathogenic role of 
      this trinucleotide repeat was evaluated by examining 154 Finnish ataxia patients 
      and 448 controls. Expansions ranging from 100 to 675 repeats were present in 9 
      (6%) unrelated patients and in 13 (3%) controls. There was a threefold excess of 
      shorter expansions (<204 repeats) in the ataxia series, and the expansions tended 
      to cluster in patients with a family history for the disease. Clinical and 
      genetic data were subsequently collected from 15 patients. Common initial 
      symptoms included gait instability, dysarthria, and tremor. A marked cerebellar 
      atrophy in magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography was found in all 
      patients. Pyramidal affection was often seen, and various kinds of cognitive 
      impairment were evident in 40% of patients. Disease progression was slow, and 
      fluctuation of symptoms was commonly observed. A maternal penetrance bias was not 
      seen, nor was there any clear-cut negative correlation between age of onset and 
      repeat number. Meiotic but not mitotic instability of the repeat expansion was 
      evident. Haplotype analysis suggests multiple origins for the Finnish 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 8 repeat expansions.

TI  - CREB-binding protein sequestration by expanded polyglutamine.
PG  - 2197-202
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is one of eight inherited 
      neurodegenerative diseases known to be caused by CAG repeat expansion. The 
      expansion results in an expanded polyglutamine tract, which likely confers a 
      novel, toxic function to the affected protein. Cell culture and transgenic mouse 
      studies have implicated the nucleus as a site for pathogenesis, suggesting that a 
      critical nuclear factor or process is disrupted by the polyglutamine expansion. 
      In this report we present evidence that CREB-binding protein (CBP), a 
      transcriptional co-activator that orchestrates nuclear response to a variety of 
      cell signaling cascades, is incorporated into nuclear inclusions formed by 
      polyglutamine-containing proteins in cultured cells, transgenic mice and tissue 
      from patients with SBMA. We also show CBP incorporation into nuclear inclusions 
      formed in a cell culture model of another polyglutamine disease, spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 3. We present evidence that soluble levels of CBP are reduced in 
      cells expressing expanded polyglutamine despite increased levels of CBP mRNA. 
      Finally, we demonstrate that over-expression of CBP rescues cells from 
      polyglutamine-mediated toxicity in neuronal cell culture. These data support a 
      CBP-sequestration model of polyglutamine expansion disease.

TI  - Sisters homozygous for the spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6)/CACNA1A gene 
      associated with different clinical phenotypes.
PG  - 69-73
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the CACNA1A gene. The neurodegeneration that occurs in 
      CAG repeat diseases is considered to share a common mechanism that may result in 
      the gain of a toxic function related to the expanded polyglutamine tracts. 
      However, the phenotypic expression in homozygotes for CAG repeat diseases has 
      been controversial, and is not clearly related to a gain of functional mechanism. 
      We identified a Japanese family with two sisters who were homozygous for the SCA6 
      with identical CAG repeat expansion (25/25). They showed an earlier age of onset 
      (27 years in both) than their father (44 years), a heterozygote with an expanded 
      allele showing the same CAG repeat length as the homozygotes (25/14). 
      Interestingly, the two sisters showed differences in disease progression and 
      severity, although the age of onset and CAG repeat length were identical. These 
      findings strongly suggest that the gene dosage influences the age of onset, but 
      other unknown factors are also important in the phenotypic expression of 
      homozygous SCA6.

TI  - Analysis of CAG repeats in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia patients and distribution of CAG repeats at the SCA1, SCA2 
      and SCA6 loci in nine ethnic populations of eastern India.
PG  - 597-604
AB  - To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 57 unrelated 
      individuals clinically diagnosed as ataxia patients we analysed the SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci for expansion of CAG repeats. We detected CAG 
      repeat expansion in 6 patients (10.5%) at the SCA1 locus. Ten of the 57 patients 
      (17.5%) had CAG repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while four had CAG expansion 
      at the SCA3/MJD locus (7%). At the SCA6 locus there was a single patient (1.8%) 
      with 21 CAG repeats. We have not detected any patient with expansion in the SCA7 
      and DRPLA loci. To test whether the frequencies of the large normal alleles in 
      SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6 loci can reflect some light on prevalence of the subtypes of 
      SCAs we studied the CAG repeat variation in these loci in nine ethnic 
      sub-populations of eastern India from which the patients originated. We report 
      here that the frequency of large normal alleles (>31 CAG repeats) in SCA1 locus 
      to be 0.211 of 394 chromosomes studied. We also report that the frequency of 
      large normal alleles (>22 CAG repeats) at the SCA2 locus is 0.038 while at the 
      SCA6 locus frequency of large normal alleles (>13 repeats) is 0.032. We discussed 
      our data in light of the distribution of normal alleles and prevalence of SCAs in 
      the Japanese and white populations.

      macular degeneration preceded by diagnostically useful tritan colorblindness. The 
      gene mutated in the disease (SCA7) has been mapped to chromosome 3p12-13.5, and 
      positional cloning identified the cause of the disease as CAG repeat expansion in 
      this gene. The SCA7 gene product, ataxin-7, is an 897 amino acid protein with an 
      expandable polyglutamine tract close to its N-terminus. No clues to ataxin-7 
      function have been obtained from sequence database searches. Here we report that 
      ataxin-7 has a motif of ca. 50 amino acids, related to the phosphate-binding site 
      of arrestins. To test the relevance of this sequence similarity, we introduced 
      the putative ataxin-7 phosphate-binding site into visual arrestin and 
      beta-arrestin. Both chimeric arrestins retain receptor-binding affinity and show 
      characteristic high selectivity for phosphorylated activated forms of rhodopsin 
      and beta-adrenergic receptor, respectively. Although the insertion of a Gly 
      residue (absent in arrestins but present in the putative phosphate-binding site 
      of ataxin-7) disrupts the function of visual arrestin-ataxin-7 chimera, it 
      enhances the function of beta-arrestin-ataxin-7 chimera. Taken together, our data 
      suggest that the arrestin-like site in the ataxin-7 sequence is a functional 
      phosphate-binding site. The presence of the phosphate-binding site in ataxin-7 
      suggests that this protein may be involved in phosphorylation-dependent binding 
      to its protein partner(s) in the cell.

TI  - Prevalence of triplet repeat expansion in ataxia patients from Hokkaido, the 
      northernmost island of Japan.
PG  - 45-51
AB  - Approximately 44% of cases of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) in Hokkaido, the 
      northernmost island of Japan, were estimated to be inherited. To determine the 
      prevalence of triplet repeat expansion in hereditary SCA patients, we genotyped 
      seven genetically defined dominant SCAs in 349 patients, including 266 patients 
      from 77 families, 78 probands from unrelated families with hereditary late-onset 
      SCA, and five patients in whom a family history of SCA was not demonstrated. The 
      frequency of each disorder in a total of 155 unrelated families was 23.9% for 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), 29.0% for SCA6, 9.7% for SCA1, 7.7% for SCA2, and 
      2.6% for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. Abnormal expansion of triplet 
      repeats for SCA7 and SCA8 was not detected. A total of 27.1% of the patients had 
      still unknown SCA mutations. In addition, the GAA repeat in the frataxin gene was 
      not abnormally expanded in 13 early-onset SCA patients with clinical features 
      similar to those of Friedreich ataxia. Comparison of our results with those from 
      other centers handling SCA showed that MJD is prevalent throughout Japan, but the 
      frequencies of other dominant SCAs differ considerably even within Japan.

TI  - Frequency of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, and DRPLA CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in patients with hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia from Chinese 
      kindreds.
PG  - 540-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of SCA1 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 1), SCA2, 
      SCA3/MJD (spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, and 
      DRPLA (dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy) CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions 
      [(CAG)n] among persons diagnosed with hereditary SCA from Chinese families. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, 
      and DRPLA (CAG)n mutation were detected with the polymerase chain reaction, 
      highly denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and silver staining 
      technique in 167 patients with autosomal dominant SCA from 85 Chinese families 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA. RESULTS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (CAG)n 
      mutation in 7 patients from 4 kindreds (4.70%) was expanded to 53 to 62 repeats. 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (CAG)n mutation in 12 patients from 5 kindreds 
      (5.88%) was expanded to 42 to 47 repeats. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3/Machado-Joseph disease (CAG)n mutation in 83 patients from 41 kindreds (48.23%) 
      was expanded to 68 to 83 repeats. Sixty-five patients from 35 kindreds (41.19%) 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA did not test positive for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, 
      SCA6, SCA7, or DRPLA. There was a predictable inverse relationship between the 
      number of CAG repeats and the age at onset for SCA3/MJD and SCA2. Clinically, 
      dementia and hyporeflexia were more frequent in patients with SCA2, while 
      spasticity, hyperreflexia, and Babinski signs were more frequent in patients with 
      SCA3/ MJD, and those might be helpful in clinical work to primarily distinguish 
      patients with SCA3/MJD and SCA2 from others with different types of SCA. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of SCA3/MJD is substantially higher than that of SCA1 
      and SCA2 in patients with autosomal dominant SCA from Chinese kindreds, who are 
      non-Portuguese. Clinical expressions of the various types of SCAs overlap one 
      another; therefore, for clinical study it is important to make a gene diagnosis 
      and genetic classification for patients with SCA.

TI  - Absence of unidentified CAG repeat expansion in patients with Huntington's 
      disease-like phenotype.
PG  - 672-5
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by an expanded (CAG)n repeat on the huntingtin gene. It is characterised 
      by motor, psychiatric and cognitive disturbances. Diagnosis can be confirmed by 
      direct genetic testing, which is highly sensitive and specific and is now 
      considered definitive. This study focused on 21 patients presenting with a 
      clinical phenotype showing strong similarity to HD, but who do not have an 
      expanded CAG in the huntingtin gene. However, other possible diagnoses could be 
      evoked for most of them. Seven patients (3.5% of our cohort) could be considered 
      as phenocopies of HD with no alternative diagnosis. Samples were screened for 
      other triplet repeat diseases with similar presentation (DRPLA, SCA-1, SCA-2, 
      SCA-3, SCA-6, and SCA-7) and were all negative. The repeat expansion detection 
      technique (RED) was used to detect uncloned CAG repeat expansions and samples 
      were also analysed by polymerase chain reaction for expansions of the polymorphic 
      CAG-ERDA-1 and CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeats. RED expansion (>40 repeats) was 
      detected in only one patient. The results suggest that unstable CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions corresponding to known or unknown sequences are not involved in the 
      aetiology of HD-like disorders. It is hypothesised that some of these phenocopies 
      could correspond to mutations in other unidentified genes with other unstable 
      repeats (different from CAG) or in unknown genes with other mutations.

TI  - Characterization of the rat spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 gene.
PG  - 103-12
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) belongs to a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive cerebellar 
      ataxia. The disease-causing mutation has recently been identified as an unstable 
      and expanded (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat in a novel gene of unknown function. In 
      Caucasians, repeat expansions in the MJD1 gene have also been found in patients 
      with the clinically distinct autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 
      (SCA3). In order to gain insight into the biology of the MJD1/SCA3 gene we cloned 
      the rat homologue and studied its expression. The rat and human ataxin-3 genes 
      are highly homologous with an overall sequence identity of approximately 88%. 
      However, the C-terminal end of the putative protein differs strongly from the 
      published human sequence. The (CAG)n block in the rat cDNA consists of just three 
      interrupted units suggesting that a long polyglutamine stretch is not essential 
      for the normal function of the ataxin-3 protein in rodents. The expression 
      pattern of the SCA3 gene in various rat and human tissues was investigated by 
      Northern blot analyses. The mature transcript is approximately 6 kb in length. In 
      rat testis, a smaller transcript of 1.3 kb was identified. Transcription of rsca3 
      was detected in most rat tissues including brain. Analyzing the expression level 
      of the SCA3 gene in several human brain sections revealed no significant higher 
      mRNA level in regions predominantly affected in MJD. Thus additional molecules 
      and/or regulatory events are necessary to explain the exclusive degeneration of 
      certain brain areas.

TI  - An unstable trinucleotide-repeat region on chromosome 13 implicated in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia: a common expansion locus.
PG  - 819-29
AB  - Larger CAG/CTG trinucleotide-repeat tracts in individuals affected with 
      schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) in comparison with 
      control individuals have previously been reported, implying a possible 
      etiological role for trinucleotide repeats in these diseases. Two unstable 
      CAG/CTG repeats, SEF2-1B and ERDA1, have recently been cloned, and studies 
      indicate that the majority of individuals with large repeats as detected by 
      repeat-expansion detection (RED) have large repeat alleles at these loci. These 
      repeats do not show association of large alleles with either BPAD or SCZ. Using 
      RED, we have identified a BPAD individual with a very large CAG/CTG repeat that 
      is not due to expansion at SEF2-1B or ERDA1. From this individual's DNA, we have 
      cloned a highly polymorphic trinucleotide repeat consisting of (CTA)n (CTG)n, 
      which is very long ( approximately 1,800 bp) in this patient. The repeat region 
      localizes to chromosome 13q21, within 1.2 cM of fragile site FRA13C. Repeat 
      alleles in our sample were unstable in 13 (5.6%) of 231 meioses. Large alleles 
      (>100 repeats) were observed in 14 (1. 25%) of 1,120 patients with psychosis, 
      borderline personality disorder, or juvenile-onset depression and in 5 (.7%) of 
      710 healthy controls. Very large alleles were also detected for Centre d'Etude 
      Polymorphisme Humaine (CEPH) reference family 1334. This triplet expansion has 
      recently been reported to be the cause of spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8); 
      however, none of our large alleles above the disease threshold occurred in 
      individuals either affected by SCA or with known family history of SCA. The high 
      frequency of large alleles at this locus is inconsistent with the much rarer 
      occurrence of SCA8. Thus, it seems unlikely that expansion alone causes SCA8; 
      other genetic mechanisms may be necessary to explain SCA8 etiology.

TI  - Molecular and clinical analyses of spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 in Japan.
PG  - 950-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the molecular and clinical features of the newly identified 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8). METHODS: We analyzed the CTG repeat region 
      of the SCA8 gene in a series of Japanese patients with cerebellar ataxia. We also 
      investigated the frequency of the CTG repeat length in Japanese normal elderly 
      subjects older than age 79. Morphometric measurements on the cerebral MRI were 
      compared between patients with SCA8 and SCA6. RESULTS: The number of the combined 
      CTA/CTG repeats of six affected SCA8 alleles was 106.3+/-24.4 (mean +/- SD) 
      ranging from 89 to 155 and that of normal elderly subjects was 24.3+/-4.4 (n = 
      104 alleles) ranging from 15 to 34. The mean age at onset of the SCA8 cases was 
      53.8+/-19.7 years, with a range from 20 to 73 years. One father and daughter from 
      an SCA8 family showed remarkable paternal anticipation. The number increase from 
      father to daughter was + 16 CTG repeats, with a 31-year acceleration of onset. 
      The six identified SCA8 patients were clinically characterized by high 
      frequencies of incoordination of trunk and limbs, ataxic dysarthria, impaired 
      smooth pursuit, and horizontal nystagmus, and the MRI showed significant atrophy 
      of the cerebellar vermis and hemispheres compared with that of normal controls. 
      There was no significant difference between SCA8 and SCA6 on the morphometric MRI 
      study. CONCLUSIONS: The CTG repeat expansions in the SCA8 alleles were much 
      greater than the range of repeats in normal elderly subjects. The SCA8 phenotype 
      manifested by cerebellar symptoms and atrophy corresponded to features of the 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type III (ADCA III).

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 in seven Korean families: CAG trinucleotide 
      expansion and clinical characteristics.
PG  - 659-64
AB  - Studies on spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) have been hampered by a lack of disease 
      markers. Clinical and pathological heterogeneity also made the classification 
      unreliable. Linkage studies established that there are multiple subtypes of SCA. 
      Five types are found to have unstable CAG expansion; the diagnosis can be 
      established by molecular genetic study. Therefore, we systemically screened 
      degenerative ataxia patients for these five SCA types, and identified eight 
      patients with SCA2 (seven from six families and one sporadic case). This paper 
      presents the clinical information on the seven patients, whose clinical 
      information was available in detail. CAG repeat expansion in the patients ranged 
      from 38 to 47 (normal control, 19 to 27). The onset ages ranged from 16 to 41 
      with 27.1 years as the mean, which correlated inversely with repeat lengths. All 
      patients presented dysarthria and gait ataxia. Upper limb dysmetria or 
      dysdiadochokinesia appeared later but progressed, causing severe disability. Slow 
      saccade (4 patients in 7) and decreased DTR (4 in 7) were common. MRIs showed 
      severe atrophy of the brainstem and cerebellum in all patients. We conclude that 
      SCA2 is the most frequent type in Korea and carries rather pure cerebellar 
      syndrome, slow saccade, and hyporeflexia.

TI  - Multiple origins of the spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCA7) mutation revealed by 
      linkage disequilibrium studies with closely flanking markers, including an 
      intragenic polymorphism (G3145TG/A3145TG).
PG  - 889-96
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCA7) is a neurodegenerative disease characterised by 
      the association of cerebellar ataxia and, in most patients, progressive macular 
      degeneration leading to loss of autonomy and blindness. The patients die after 
      5-30 years of evolution. The cause of the disease has been identified as a (CAG)n 
      repeat expansion in the coding sequence of the SCA7 gene on chromosome 3p. De 
      novo mutations occur on intermediate-sized alleles carrying from 28 to 35 CAG 
      repeats. Neomutations explain the persistence of the disease in spite of the 
      great instability of the repeat sequence which results in the appearance of 
      juvenile onset patients and the extinction of the disease within families. This 
      rare disorder has been reported in a wide variety of countries and ethnic groups. 
      In a large number of SCA7 families (n = 41) of different origins, we have 
      determined the haplotypes segregating with the mutation of several microsatellite 
      markers close to the SCA7 gene and of a new intragenic polymorphism 
      (G3145TG/A3145TG). Four different haplotypes were found for centromeric markers 
      (G3145TG/A3145TG-D3S1287-D3S3635) in the majority of the kindreds from four 
      different geographic regions: A-2-4 in Korea; A-3-6 in North Africa, B-3-6 in 
      continental Europe and A-4-6 in the UK and USA. The haplotypes in the Jamaican, 
      Filipino, Brazilian and German families were different, suggesting that 
      independent regional founders are at the origin of the SCA7 mutation in each 
      population. Two different haplotypes were observed, however, in two families from 
      the same rural area in central Italy in which de novo SCA7 mutations on 
      intermediate alleles have been observed, suggesting the existence of different 
      pools of at-risk chromosomes in this population.

TI  - Pontine atrophy in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 17-22
AB  - To investigate the clinical range of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), we 
      screened CAG repeat expansion in the voltage-dependent alpha 1A calcium channel 
      gene (CACNL1A4) in 71 ataxic patients in 60 families; 54 patients in 43 families 
      with hereditary ataxia and 17 sporadic patients. Thirteen patients with SCA6 were 
      detected to have elongated CAG in CACNL1A4. Of these, 7 patients had been 
      diagnosed as having hereditary cerebellar cortical atrophy, and 6 patients had 
      been found to have sporadic occurrence. One patient showed distinct pontine 
      atrophy with prominent horizontal or oblique gaze nystagmus which is an unusual 
      feature in sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy. For the efficient screening of 
      SCA6, we would propose testing CAG repeat expansion in CACNL1A4, in patients with 
      one of two markers: (1) horizontal or oblique gaze nystagmus without other eye 
      movement disorders, (2) pure cerebellar atrophy, even if occurrence is sporadic. 
      We should note that the pontine atrophy could also be caused by CAG repeat 
      expansion in CACNL1A4.

TI  - A non-radioactive polymerase chain reaction method for diagnosis of 
      Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 705-7
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is caused by 
      unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the coding region of the MJD gene. 
      In this study, we describe a non-radioactive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      method to detect the CAG repeat range of the MJD gene. This technique allows 
      direct visualization of the PCR products on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels 
      within hours. In this study, genomic DNA samples isolated from peripheral 
      lymphocytes, amniotic fluid cells, and chorionic villi were tested with two sets 
      of commonly used MJD primers. PCR conditions were optimized, which resulted in 
      clear visualization of both the primer sets on 3% agarose gels. Ten out of 25 
      candidate MJD patients have been identified with this method to date, with no 
      false-positive or false-negative diagnoses. This simple, reliable, and 
      cost-effective method can be used for patient diagnosis, pre-symptomatic 
      diagnosis, and prenatal diagnosis.

TI  - A common disease haplotype segregating in spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) 
      pedigrees of diverse ethnic origin.
PG  - 841-5
AB  - The identification of a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion, located within the 
      coding sequence of the ataxin-2 gene, as the mutation underlying spinocerebellar 
      ataxia 2 (SCA2) has facilitated direct investigation of pedigrees previously 
      excluded from linkage analysis due to insufficient size or pedigree structure. We 
      have previously described the identification of the ancestral disease haplotype 
      segregating in the Cuban founder population used to assign the disease locus to 
      chromosome 12q23-24.1. We now report evidence for the segregation of the 
      identical core haplotype in pedigrees of diverse ethnic origin from India, Japan 
      and England, established by the analysis of the loci D12S1672 and D12S1333 
      located 20kb proximal and 200 kb distal to the triplet repeat motif respectively. 
      Interpretation of this data is suggestive that for these pedigrees at least, the 
      mutation has arisen on a single ancestral or predisposing chromosome.

TI  - Very large (CAG)(n) DNA repeat expansions in the sperm of two spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 7 males.
PG  - 2473-8
AB  - Genetic anticipation, i.e. increasing disease severity and decreasing age of 
      onset from one generation to the next, is observed in a number of diseases, 
      including myotonic dystrophy type 1, Huntington's disease and several of the 
      spinocerebellar ataxias. All of these disorders are associated with the expansion 
      of a trinucleotide repeat and array length is positively correlated with disease 
      severity and inversely correlated with the age of onset. The expanded repeat is 
      highly unstable and continues to expand from one generation to the next, 
      providing a molecular explanation for anticipation. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 
      (SCA7) is one of the latest additions to the list of triplet repeat diseases and 
      is distinct from the other SCAs in that it is accompanied by retinal 
      degeneration. Pedigree analyses have previously revealed that the SCA7 repeat is 
      highly unstable and liable to expand, in particular when transmitted by a male. 
      Surprisingly, though, an under-representation of male transmission has also been 
      reported. We now demonstrate directly by single molecule analyses that the 
      expanded repeat is extraordinarily unstable in the male germline and biased 
      toward massive increases. Nearly all of the mutant sperm of two SCA7 males 
      contain alleles that are so large that most of the affected offspring would at 
      best have a severe infantile form of the disease. Indeed, the gross 
      under-representation of such very large expanded alleles in patients suggests 
      that a significant proportion of such alleles might be associated with embryonic 
      lethality or dysfunctional sperm.

TI  - Disassembly of nuclear inclusions in the dividing cell--a novel insight into 
      neurodegeneration.
PG  - 2451-9
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias and Huntington's disease are examples of 
      neurodegenerative diseases caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion. One 
      hallmark of such diseases is the formation of inclusion bodies (IBs) within 
      neuronal tissue. Although these inclusions may play a pivotal role in the disease 
      process, the reasons underlying their specific accumulation remain obscure. By 
      studying intranuclear IBs in dividing cells we demonstrate for the first time 
      that inclusions such as those of ataxin-1 disperse during mitosis, thus reducing 
      the nuclear aggregate burden. IBs reform in the interphase nucleus. By 
      high-resolution confocal microscopy we also show that inclusions comprise ordered 
      structures capable of homotypic interactions. Unlike those of a non-pathologic 
      protein, ataxin-1 inclusions were shown to be capable of non-specific protein 
      sequestration. Our studies indicate that the specific accumulation of inclusions 
      in terminally differentiated cells such as neurons is a direct consequence of 
      their inability to divide and therefore provides a key to explaining their 
      persistence in neurodegenerative disease.

TI  - Analysis of the dynamic mutation in the SCA7 gene shows marked parental effects 
      on CAG repeat transmission.
PG  - 525-32
AB  - The gene for spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCA7) includes a transcribed, translated 
      CAG tract that is expanded in SCA7 patients. We have determined expansions in 73 
      individuals from 17 SCA7 kindreds and compared them with repeat lengths of 180 
      unaffected individuals. Subjects with abnormal expansions comprise 59 clinically 
      affected individuals and 14 at-risk currently unaffected individuals predicted to 
      carry the mutation by haplotype analysis. For expanded alleles, CAG repeat length 
      correlates with disease progression and severity and correlates inversely with 
      age of onset. Increased repeat lengths are seen in generational transmission of 
      the disease allele, consistent with the pattern of clinical anticipation seen in 
      these kindreds. Repeat lengths in expanded alleles show somatic mosaicism in 
      leukocyte DNA, suggesting that these alleles are unstable within individuals as 
      well as between generations. Although dynamic repeat expansions from paternal 
      transmissions are greater than those from maternal transmissions, maternal 
      transmission of disease is more common, suggesting germline or embryonic effects 
      of the repeat expansion.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) - correlations between phenotype and 
      genotype in one large Belgian family.
PG  - 37-46
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), in which the degenerative process also 
      affect the retina, belongs to the category of the autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia type II (ADCA II). We have described the neuropathology of this condition 
      [Martin JJ, Van Regemorter N, Krols L, Brucher JM, de Barsy T, Szliwowski H, et 
      al. On an autosomal dominant form of retino-cerebellar degeneration: an autopsy 
      study of five patients in one family. Acta Neuropathol (Berl) 1994;88:277-286] in 
      a very large Belgian family (CA-1). We have observed anticipation in the age of 
      onset with increasing severity of the symptoms in consecutive generations. The 
      SCA7 gene was mapped to chromosome 3p12-13 [David G, Abbas N, Stevanin G, Durr A, 
      Yvert G, Cancel G, et al. Cloning of the SCA7 gene reveals a highly unstable CAG 
      repeat expansion. Nat Genet 1997;17:65-70; Del-Favero J, Krols L, Michalik A, 
      Theuns J, Lofgren A, Goossens D, et al. Molecular genetic analysis of autosomal 
      dominant cerebellar ataxia with retinal degeneration (ADCA type II) caused by CAG 
      triplet repeat expansion. Hum Mol Genet 1998;7:177-186], and the gene identified. 
      SCA7 is a new gene of unknown function that contains an expansion of CAG repeats 
      in SCA7 patients. During the procedure of positional cloning, we examined 26 
      patients belonging to the CA-1 family and realized, in some of them, an 
      ophthalmologic examination and neuro-imaging of the brain. This allowed us to 
      differentiate four groups: (1) asymptomatic young carriers with 38 to 43 CAG 
      repeats; (2) mildly symptomatic, older patients with 38-41 CAG repeats; (3) 
      patients with the full-blown picture of SCA7 and age of onset during adolescence, 
      with 54-55 CAG repeats; (4) children with early onset and rapid fatal course of 
      the disease who had over 55 CAG repeats. We were able to draw correlations 
      between clinical phenotype, age at onset and CAG repeat number and to make 
      predictions, to some extent, as to the clinical course of the disease in new 
      patients.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias in Spanish patients: genetic analysis of familial and 
      sporadic cases. The Ataxia Study Group.
PG  - 516-22
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically heterogeneous group 
      of neurodegenerative disorders caused by unstable CAG repeat expansions encoding 
      polyglutamine tracts. Five spinocerebellar ataxia genes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 
      and SCA7) and another related dominant ataxia gene (DRPLA) have been cloned, 
      allowing the genetic classification of these disorders. We present here the 
      molecular analysis of 87 unrelated familial and 60 sporadic Spanish cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia. For ADCA cases 15% were SCA2, 15% SCA3, 6% SCA1, 3% SCA7, 
      1% SCA6 and 1% DRPLA, an extremely rare mutation in Caucasoid populations. About 
      58% of ADCA cases remained genetically unclassified. All the SCA1 cases belong to 
      the same geographical area and share a common haplotype for the SCA1 mutation. 
      The expanded alleles ranged from 41 to 59 repeats for SCA1, 35 to 46 [corrected] 
      for SCA2, 67 to 77 for SCA3, and 38 to 113 for SCA7. One SCA6 case had 25 repeats 
      and one DRPLA case had 63 repeats. The highest CAG repeat variation in meiotic 
      transmission of expanded alleles was detected in SCA7, this being of +67 units in 
      one paternal transmission and giving rise to a 113 CAG repeat allele in a patient 
      who died at 3 years of age. Meiotic transmissions have also shown a tendency to 
      more frequent paternal transmission of expanded alleles in SCA1 and maternal in 
      SCA7. All SCA1 and SCA2 expanded alleles analyzed consisted of pure CAG repeats, 
      whereas normal alleles were interrupted by 1-2 CAT trinucleotides in SCA1, except 
      for three alleles of 6, 14 and 21 CAG repeats, and by 1-3 CAA trinucleotides in 
      SCA2. No SCA or DRPLA mutations were detected in the 60 sporadic cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia, but one late onset patient was identified as a recessive 
      form due to GAA-repeat expansions in the Friedreich's ataxia gene.

PG  - 1657-64
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) belongs to a group of neurological disorders 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of the associated gene. To 
      gain insight into the pathogenesis of SCA7 and possible functions of ataxin-7, we 
      examined the subcellular localization of ataxin-7 in transfected COS-1 cells 
      using SCA7 cDNA clones with different CAG repeat tract lengths. In addition to a 
      diffuse distribution throughout the nucleus, ataxin-7 associated with the nuclear 
      matrix and the nucleolus. The location of the putative SCA7 nuclear localization 
      sequence (NLS) was confirmed by fusing an ataxin-7 fragment with the normally 
      cytoplasmic protein chicken muscle pyruvate kinase. Mutation of this NLS 
      prevented protein from entering the nucleus. Thus, expanded ataxin-7 may carry 
      out its pathogenic effects in the nucleus by altering a matrix-associated nuclear 
      structure and/or by disrupting nucleolar function.

TI  - Mapping of a new autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia to chromosome 22.
PG  - 594-9
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) are a clinically and 
      genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. The clinical symptoms include 
      cerebellar dysfunction and associated signs from dysfunction in other parts of 
      the nervous system. So far, five spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) genes have been 
      identified: SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7. Loci for SCA4 and SCA5 have been 
      mapped. However, approximately one-third of SCAs have remained unassigned. We 
      have identified a Mexican American pedigree that segregates a new form of ataxia 
      clinically characterized by gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus. Two 
      individuals have seizures. After excluding all known genetic loci for linkage, we 
      performed a genomewide search and identified linkage to a 15-cM region on 
      chromosome 22q13. A maximum LOD score of 4.3 (recombination fraction 0) was 
      obtained for D22S928 and D22S1161. This distinct form of ataxia has been 
      designated "SCA10." Anticipation was observed in the available parent-child 
      pairs, suggesting that trinucleotide-repeat expansion may be the mutagenic 
      mechanism.

TI  - Incidence of dominant spinocerebellar and Friedreich triplet repeats among 361 
      ataxia families.
PG  - 1666-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 
      3, 6, and 7 and Friedreich's ataxia (FA) among a large panel of ataxia families. 
      BACKGROUND: The ataxias are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative diseases that variably affect the cerebellum, brainstem, and 
      spinocerebellar tracts. Trinucleotide repeat expansions have been shown to be the 
      mutational mechanism for five dominantly inherited SCAs as well as FA. METHODS: 
      We collected DNA samples and clinical data from patients representing 361 
      families with adult-onset ataxia of unknown etiology. Patients with a clinical 
      diagnosis of FA were specifically excluded from our collection. RESULTS: Among 
      the 178 dominant kindreds, we found SCA1 expansion at a frequency of 5.6%, SCA2 
      expansion at a frequency of 15.2%, SCA3 expansion at a frequency of 20.8%, SCA6 
      expansion at a frequency of 15.2%, and SCA7 expansion at a frequency of 4.5%. FA 
      alleles were found in 11.4% of apparently recessive and 5.2% of apparently 
      sporadic patients. Among these patients the repeat sizes for one or both FA 
      alleles were relatively small, with sizes for the smaller allele ranging from 90 
      to 600 GAA repeats. The clinical presentation for these patients is atypical for 
      FA, with one or more of the following characteristics: adult onset of disease, 
      retained tendon reflexes, normal plantar response, and intact or partially intact 
      sensory perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogenic trinucleotide repeat expansions were 
      found among 61% of the dominant kindreds. Among patients with apparently 
      recessive or negative family histories of ataxia, 6.8% and 4.4% tested positive 
      for a CAG expansion at one of the dominant loci, and 11.4 and 5.2% of patients 
      with apparently recessive or sporadic forms of ataxia had FA expansions. Because 
      of the significant implications that a dominant versus recessive inheritance 
      pattern has for future generations, it is important to screen patients who do not 
      have a clearly dominant inheritance pattern for expansions at both the FA and the 
      dominant ataxia loci.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA 2) in an infant with extreme CAG repeat 
      expansion.
PG  - 383-7
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders that generally present in adulthood. Spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 2 typically presents with progressive cerebellar symptoms, slow 
      ocular saccades, and peripheral neuropathy. The onset of symptoms is usually 
      between 20 and 40 years. We describe an infant who presented with neonatal 
      hypotonia, developmental delay, and dysphagia. Ocular findings of retinitis 
      pigmentosa were noted at 10 months. Her father had mild spinocerebellar ataxia 
      first noted at age 22 years. Molecular studies of the SCA2 gene showed a CAG 
      expansion of 43 repeats in the father and an extreme CAG repeat expansion of more 
      than 200 in the baby. Our report expands the known phenotype and genotype of 
      SCA2. Testing for dominant ataxias should be included in the evaluation of 
      infants with nonspecific progressive neurologic symptoms and retinitis 
      pigmentosa, especially in cases with a positive family history for 
      spinocerebellar ataxia.

TI  - Close associations between prevalences of dominantly inherited spinocerebellar 
      ataxias with CAG-repeat expansions and frequencies of large normal CAG alleles in 
      Japanese and Caucasian populations.
PG  - 1060-6
AB  - To test the hypothesis that the frequencies of normal alleles (ANs) with a 
      relatively large number of CAG repeats (large ANs) are related to the prevalences 
      of the dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs)-SCA types 1, 2, 3 (Machado-Joseph 
      disease), 6, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA)-we investigated the 
      relative prevalences of these diseases in 202 Japanese and 177 Caucasian families 
      and distributions of the number of CAG repeats of ANs at these disease loci in 
      normal individuals in each population. The relative prevalences of SCA1 and SCA2 
      were significantly higher in Caucasian pedigrees (15% and 14%, respectively) than 
      in Japanese pedigrees (3% and 5%, respectively), corresponding to the observation 
      that the frequencies of large ANs of SCA1 (alleles >30 repeats) and of SCA2 
      (alleles >22 repeats) were significantly higher in Caucasians than in Japanese. 
      The relative prevalences of MJD/SCA3, SCA6, and DRPLA were significantly higher 
      in Japanese pedigrees (43%, 11%, and 20%, respectively) than in Caucasian 
      pedigrees (30%, 5%, and 0%, respectively), corresponding to the observation that 
      the frequencies of large ANs of MJD/SCA3 (>27 repeats), SCA6 (>13 repeats), and 
      DRPLA (>17 repeats) were significantly higher in Japanese than in Caucasians. The 
      close correlations of the relative prevalences of the dominant SCAs with the 
      distributions of large ANs strongly support the assumption that large ANs 
      contribute to generation of expanded alleles (AEs) and the relative prevalences 
      of the dominant SCAs.

TI  - De novo expansion of intermediate alleles in spinocerebellar ataxia 7.
PG  - 1809-13
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCA7) is the eighth neurodegenerative disorder caused 
      by a translated CAG repeat expansion. Normal SCA7 alleles carry from four to 35 
      CAG repeats, whereas pathological alleles carry from 37 to approximately 200. 
      Intermediate alleles (IAs), with 28-35 repeats in the SCA7 gene are exceedingly 
      rare in the general population and are not associated with the SCA7 phenotype, 
      although they have been found among relatives of four SCA7 families. In two of 
      these families, IAs bearing 35 and 28 CAG repeats gave rise, during paternal 
      transmission, to SCA7 expansions of 57 and 47 repeats, respectively, that were 
      confirmed by haplotype reconstructions in one case and by inference in the other. 
      Furthermore, the four haplotypes segregating with IAs were identical to the 
      expanded alleles in each kindred, but differed among the families, indicating 
      multiple origins of the SCA7 mutation in these families with different 
      geographical origins. Our results provide the first evidence of de novo SCA7 
      expansions from IAs that are not associated with the phenotype but can expand to 
      the pathological range during some paternal transmissions. IAs that segregate in 
      unaffected branches of the pedigrees might, therefore, constitute a reservoir for 
      future de novo mutations that occur in a recurrent but random manner. This would 
      explain the persistence of the disease in spite of the great anticipation 
      (approximately 20 years/generation) characteristic of SCA7. So far, de novo 
      expansions among the disorders caused by polyglutamine repeats have only been 
      demonstrated in Huntington's disease.

TI  - Expanded polyglutamine protein forms nuclear inclusions and causes neural 
      degeneration in Drosophila.
PG  - 939-49
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3/MJD) is one of at least eight human 
      neurodegenerative diseases caused by glutamine-repeat expansion. We have 
      recreated glutamine-repeat disease in Drosophila using a segment of the SCA3/MJD 
      protein. Targeted expression of the protein with an expanded polyglutamine repeat 
      led to nuclear inclusion (NI) formation and late-onset cell degeneration. 
      Differential sensitivity to the mutant transgene was observed among different 
      cell types, with neurons being particularly susceptible; NI formation alone was 
      not sufficient for degeneration. The viral antiapoptotic gene P35 mitigated 
      polyglutamine-induced degeneration in vivo. Our results demonstrate that cellular 
      mechanisms of human glutamine-repeat disease are conserved in invertebrates. This 
      fly model will aid in identifying additional factors that modulate 
      neurodegeneration.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7): a neurodegenerative disorder with neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusions.
PG  - 913-8
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with progressive macular degeneration is 
      caused by a CAG/glutamine repeat expansion in the SCA7 gene/protein. Neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusions were detected in the brain of an early onset SCA7 case 
      with the 1C2 antibody directed against an expanded polyglutamine domain. Nuclear 
      inclusions were most frequent in the inferior olivary complex, a site of severe 
      neuronal loss in SCA7. They were also observed in other brain regions, including 
      the cerebral cortex, not considered to be affected in the disease. Using confocal 
      microscopy we showed that some inclusions were ubiquitinated, but to varying 
      degrees, ranging from <1% in the cerebral cortex to 60% in the inferior olive. In 
      addition, we also observed cytoplasmic staining using the 1C2 antibody, 
      particularly in the supramarginal gyrus, the hippocampus, the thalamus, the 
      lateral geniculate body and the pontine nuclei. These data confirm that the 
      presence of intranuclear inclusions in neurons is a common characteristic of 
      disorders caused by CAG/polyglutamine expansions, but unlike what has been 
      reported for Huntington's disease, SCA1 and SCA3/MJD, in SCA7 the inclusions were 
      not restricted to the sites of severe neuronal loss.

TI  - Analysis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 in Gunma Prefecture in Japan: CAG 
      trinucleotide expansion and clinical characteristics.
PG  - 180-5
AB  - We analyzed 13 patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) in seven 
      unrelated families who live in Gunma Prefecture, Japan (population approx. 
      2,000,000), and documented the clinical and molecular properties correlated with 
      the CAG repeat expansion. Twelve of the 13 patients and one presymptomatic female 
      were genetically examined, and the CAG repeat number of the expanded and normal 
      alleles was 40.8+/-4.8 (mean+/-S.D., n=13) and 22+/-0 (n=13), respectively. The 
      repeat size of the expanded alleles was inversely correlated with the patients' 
      age at onset. Paternal anticipation was observed, accompanied by an increase of 
      the CAG repeat size. The patients presented here were clinically characterized by 
      a relatively higher frequency of slow saccades, hyporeflexia, hypotonia, and 
      tremor. A number of peaks in the expanded allele on polyacrylamide gel 
      electrophoresis showed the presence of cell mosaicism in SCA2 as well. In Gunma 
      Prefecture, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 are 
      almost equally present and at higher frequencies than spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      1 and hereditary dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy, which are rare. Thus, the 
      difference of frequency of autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias may be 
      present in Japan.

TI  - Machado-Joseph disease in three Scandinavian families.
PG  - 152-7
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative disorder characterized by varying age of onset and pronounced 
      phenotypic heterogeneity. The clinical core features include gait ataxia, 
      external ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, and bulging eyes. Recently, Kawagushi et al. 
      (1994) cloned the MJD1 gene on chromosome 14 and MJD turned out to be the fifth 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by an unstable CAG repeat expansion. We have 
      studied two large Danish families and one Norwegian family with MJD. Three 
      features not previously associated with MJD are reported: dementia, generalized 
      muscle and joint pain, and in one case neuropathological examination revealed 
      atrophy of the inferior olives. We found a significant inverse correlation 
      between age of onset and the length of the CAG repeat expansion, and anticipation 
      is described through four succeeding generations. Instability of the CAG repeat 
      expansion was most pronounced at paternal transmission.

TI  - Maternal anticipation in Machado-Joseph disease (MJD): some maternal factors 
      independent of the number of CAG repeat units may play a role in genetic 
      anticipation in a Japanese MJD family.
PG  - 141-5
AB  - We studied the relationship between the number of CAG repeat units in the MJD1 
      gene and clinical features of Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) in eight patients from 
      two generations of a Japanese MJD family. Because of lack of characteristic 
      clinical signs of MJD such as dystonia, bulging eyes or facial myokymia, clinical 
      diagnosis of MJD in this family was difficult to make prior to molecular testing 
      for the CAG repeat expansion in the MJD1 gene. All the patients exhibited 
      maternal transmission of MJD, and the intergenerational change in the number of 
      CAG repeat units in the MJD1 gene was very small (+0.5+/-0.3, mean+/-S.E.M., n=4) 
      in spite of marked genetic anticipation (-17.0 years/generation). In the present 
      family, the degree of anticipation per repeat unit in maternal transmissions was 
      much larger than that in maternal transmissions in the other six MJD families. 
      This indicates that some maternal factors other than the increase of the number 
      of CAG repeat units, which is known to be the basis of anticipation, may play a 
      role in genetic anticipation in this MJD family.

PG  - 1352-3
AB  - We report here a simple method for generating large CAG/CTG repeat sequences. We 
      have applied this method to clone the genomic sequence containing the CAG/CTG 
      repeat and its upstream intronic sequence present in spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3 or Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) by a modified DIRECT method. With these 
      modifications we have considerably simplified the generation of the repeat probe 
      used to screen for anomalous bands. This method will facilitate the molecular 
      approach to other genetic disorders where expansions of repeat sequences could be 
      involved.

TI  - Uncloned expanded CAG/CTG repeat sequences in autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia (ADCA) detected by the repeat expansion detection (RED) method.
PG  - 99-102
AB  - In some neurodegenerative diseases, genetic anticipation correlates with 
      expansions of the CAG/CTG repeat sequence above the normal range through the 
      generations of a pedigree. Among these neurodegenerative diseases are late onset 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA). ADCA are genetically heterogeneous 
      disorders with different cloned genes for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), 
      type 2 (SCA2), type 3 or Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), and type 6 (SCA6). 
      Another related dominant ataxia, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), 
      also shows CAG/CTG repeat expansions. Genetic anticipation has been reported for 
      all of them except for the recently cloned SCA6 gene. Other, as yet undetected 
      SCA genes may show the same features. We have used the repeat expansion detection 
      (RED) method to detect repeat expansions directly in DNA samples from ADCA 
      patients not resulting from known genes. Our sample consists of 19 affected index 
      cases, corresponding to 52.8% of our ADCA families without CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions in the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, or DRPLA genes. Eighty-nine percent 
      of the index cases had expansions of a CAG/CTG sequence greater than 40 repeats 
      by RED, while these were observed in only 26.9% of 78 healthy subjects from the 
      general population (p < 0.0001). The distribution of RED fragments in controls 
      and ADCA patients also shows significant differences with the Mann-Whitney U test 
      (U = 376.5, p = 0.0007). Moreover, there was a significant inverse correlation 
      between the size of expansion and the age of onset (r = -0.54, p = 0.018). These 
      results show CAG/CTG repeat expansions of over 40 repeats in our sample of ADCA 
      families not resulting from known SCA genes.

TI  - Molecular genetic analysis of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with retinal 
      degeneration (ADCA type II) caused by CAG triplet repeat expansion.
PG  - 177-86
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with retinal degeneration (ADCAII) was 
      previously mapped by linkage analysis studies to chromosome 3p12-p21.1 (SCA7). 
      Positional cloning efforts have recently identified a novel gene, SCA7 , 
      containing a translated CAG repeat, expanded in SCA7 patients. We cloned the SCA7 
      gene from a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone contig spanning the SCA7 
      candidate region. Using a combination of genomic sequencing and cosmid-based exon 
      trapping, two expressed sequence tags were identified. Sequencing of the 
      corresponding cDNA clones and RT-PCR analysis identified the full-length SCA7 
      cDNA. Together, our sequence data defined the intron/exon boundaries of the first 
      two coding exons of the SCA7 gene, with the first exon containing the expanded 
      CAG repeat. Further, sequence comparison with the published SCA7 cDNA identified 
      one additional putative exon in the 5'-UTR region of the SCA7 gene. The SCA7 gene 
      was mapped on the YAC contig in the 2.5 cM interval between D3S1600 and D3S1287. 
      In one extended Belgian SCA7 pedigree the expanded alleles ranged from 38 to at 
      least 55 repeats with allele lengths being inversely correlated with onset age of 
      ADCAII symptoms. The SCA7 repeats increased in length in successive generations. 
      Normal alleles had from four to 18 repeats, with 10 repeats being the most common 
      allele.

      SCA7 CAG repeat was expanded in 77 patients and in 11 at-risk individuals, with 
      alleles containing from 37 to 130 repeats, demonstrating that SCA7 is genetically 
      homogeneous. Repeats on normal alleles contained from 7 to 35 CAGs. There was a 
      strong negative correlation (r = -0.84) between the age at onset and the size of 
      the CAG repeat expansion in SCA7 patients. Larger expansions were associated with 
      earlier onset, a more severe and rapid clinical course, and a higher frequency of 
      decreased vision, ophthalmoplegia, extensor plantar response and scoliosis. The 
      frequency of other clinical signs such as dysphagia and sphincter disturbances 
      increased with disease duration. The mutation was highly unstable during 
      transmission, with a mean increase of 10 +/- 16 CAG repeats, which was 
      significantly greater in paternal (15 +/- 20) than in maternal (5 +/- 5) 
      transmissions. This correlated well with the marked anticipation (19 +/- 13 
      years) observed in the families. Gonadal mosaicism, observed in the sperm of a 
      patient, was particularly important, with expanded alleles ranging from 42 to 
      >155 CAG repeats. The degree of instability during transmission, resulting mostly 
      in expansions, is greater than in the seven other neurodegenerative disorders 
      caused by polyglutamine expansions.

AB  - An expanded and unstable CAG repeat in the coding region of the MJD1 gene is the 
      mutation responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia 3/Machado-Joseph disease. In 
      order to determine whether there was a higher degree of instability in affected 
      regions, the size of the expanded CAG repeat was analyzed in different regions of 
      the central nervous system, in two unrelated SCA3/MJD patients. The degree of 
      somatic mosaicism was quantified and compared to that in a SCA1 patient. 
      Instability of the expanded CAG repeat was observed in peripheral tissues as well 
      as in CNS of the three patients, but there was no correlation between the degree 
      of mosaicism and the selective vulnerability of CNS structures. As in the other 
      diseases caused by expanded CAG repeats, a lower degree of mosaicism was found in 
      the cerebellar cortex of both SCA1 and SCA3/MJD patients, probably reflecting 
      specific properties of this structure. In SCA3/MJD, the degree of mosaicism 
      seemed to correlate with age at death rather than with the size of the expanded 
      CAG repeat. Finally, somatic instability was more pronounced in SCA1 than in 
      SCA3/MJD patients.

TI  - Rapid cloning of expanded trinucleotide repeat sequences from genomic DNA.
PG  - 72-5
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansions have been shown to cause a number of 
      neurodegenerative diseases. A hallmark of most of these diseases is the presence 
      of anticipation, a decrease in the age at onset in consecutive generations due to 
      the tendency of the unstable trinucleotide repeat to lengthen when passed from 
      one generation to the next. The involvement of trinucleotide repeat expansions in 
      a number of other diseases--including familial spastic paraplegia, schizophrenia, 
      bipolar affective disorder and spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7; ref. 10)--is 
      suggested both by the presence of anticipation and by repeat expansion detection 
      (RED) analysis of genomic DNA samples. The involvement of trinucleotide 
      expansions in these diseases, however, can be conclusively confirmed only by the 
      isolation of the expansions present in these populations and detailed analysis to 
      assess each expansion as a possible pathogenic mutation. We describe a novel 
      procedure for quick isolation of expanded trinucleotide repeats and the 
      corresponding flanking nucleotide sequence directly from small amounts of genomic 
      DNA by a process of Repeat Analysis, Pooled Isolation and Detection of individual 
      clones containing expanded trinucleotide repeats (RAPID cloning). We have used 
      this technique to clone the pathogenic SCA7 CAG expansion from an archived DNA 
      sample of an individual affected with ataxia and retinal degeneration.

TI  - Polymorphisms at 13 expressed human sequences containing CAG/CTG repeats and 
      analysis in autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) patients.
PG  - 18-21
AB  - Genetic anticipation--increasing severity and a decrease in the age of onset with 
      successive generations of a pedigree--is clearly present in autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia (ADCA). Anticipation is correlated with expansion of the 
      CAG/CTG repeat sequence to sizes above those in the normal range through the 
      generations of a pedigree. Genetic heterogeneity has been demonstrated for ADCA, 
      with four cloned genes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, and SCA6) and three mapped loci 
      (SCA4, SCA5 and SCA7). Another related dominant ataxia, 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), presents anticipation with CAG/CTG 
      repeat expansions. We had previously analysed ADCA patients who had not shown 
      repeat expansions in cloned genes for CAG/CTG repeat expansions by the repeat 
      expansion detection method (RED) and had detected expansions of between 48 and 88 
      units in 17 unrelated familial cases. We present here an analysis of 13 genes and 
      expressed sequence tags (ESTs) containing 10 or more CAG/CTG repeat sequences 
      selected from public databases in the 17 unrelated ADCA patients. Of the 13 
      selected genes and ESTs, 9 were found to be polymorphic with heterozygosities 
      ranging between 0.09 and 0.80 and 2 to 17 alleles. In ADCA patients none of the 
      loci showed expansions above the normal range of the CAG/CTG repeat sequences, 
      excluding them as the mutation causing ADCA.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6: CAG repeat expansion in alpha1A voltage-dependent 
      calcium channel gene and clinical variations in Japanese population.
PG  - 879-84
AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are clinically and genetically 
      a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, mild CAG repeat 
      expansion in the alpha1A voltage-dependent calcium channel gene has been found to 
      be associated with a type of autosomal dominant SCA (SCA6). We analyzed 98 
      Japanese families with autosomal dominant SCAs, for whom CAG repeat expansions of 
      the SCA1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy genes were excluded, and 5 apparently sporadic cases of cortical 
      cerebellar atrophy. The diagnosis of SCA6 was confirmed in 30 families (31%) 
      comprising 47 affected individuals and 1 sporadic case. The size of expanded CAG 
      repeats ranged from 21 to 26 repeat units and was found to be correlated 
      inversely with age at onset. We identified 2 SCA6 patients homozygous for 
      expanded CAG repeats, whose ages at onset were earlier than the 95% lower 
      confidence level, suggesting the presence of a gene dosage effect of expanded CAG 
      repeat. Ataxia is the most common initial symptom found in 45 of the 48 patients. 
      Patients with a prolonged disease course showed other accompanying clinical 
      features including dystonic postures, involuntary movements, and abnormalities in 
      tendon reflexes.

PG  - 534-6
AB  - Despite much effort, a 74 year old man with progressive proximal weakness and 
      sensory disturbances due to axonal neuropathy remained a diagnostic problem. 
      Investigation of his family disclosed an additional patient with a cerebellar 
      syndrome and a family member with mainly pyramidal features. Analysis of DNA 
      showed a CAG repeat expansion in the Machado-Joseph disease gene in all three 
      patients. Although not conclusively proved, we think that the neuropathy of the 
      index case is linked to the CAG repeat expansion. Machado-Joseph disease should 
      be considered in progressive axonal neuropathy.

TI  - The expansion of the CAG repeat in ataxin-2 is a frequent cause of autosomal 
      dominant spinocerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 1009-13
AB  - The autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (ADSCAs) are a heterogeneous group 
      of late-onset neurodegenerative disorders with overlapping clinical features. 
      Genetic linkage studies have identified at least seven distinct loci for the 
      ADSCAs, allowing the genetic classification of these disorders. The 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) locus was mapped to chromosome 12, and a 
      gene responsible for this disorder was recently isolated. The mutation causing 
      SCA2 is an expansion of a trinucleotide CAG repeat contained within the coding 
      region of a novel gene. We describe the results of genotypic analysis for the 
      SCA2 repeat in individuals with ADSCA who were previously found negative for CAG 
      repeat expansions in the SCA1, SCA3, or SCA6 genes. The expanded CAG repeat has 
      been identified in 15 independent families. Repeat instability and anticipation 
      were observed in two large kindreds. The SCA2 mutation was found in 18% of our 
      ADSCA kindreds, confirming the high proportion of SCA2 among this group of 
      disorders.

PG  - 65-70
AB  - The gene for spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCA7) has been mapped to chromosome 
      3p12-13. By positional cloning, we have identified a new gene of unknown function 
      containing a CAG repeat that is expanded in SCA7 patients. On mutated alleles, 
      CAG repeat size is highly variable, ranging from 38 to 130 repeats, whereas on 
      normal alleles it ranges from 7 to 17 repeats. Gonadal instability in SCA7 is 
      greater than that observed in any of the seven known neuro-degenerative diseases 
      caused by translated CAG repeat expansions, and is markedly associated with 
      paternal transmissions. SCA7 is the first such disorder in which the degenerative 
      process also affects the retina.

TI  - Intranuclear inclusions of expanded polyglutamine protein in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 3.
PG  - 333-44
AB  - The mechanism of neurodegeneration in CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion diseases 
      is unknown but is thought to occur at the protein level. Here, in studies of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), 
      we show that the disease protein ataxin-3 accumulates in ubiquitinated 
      intranuclear inclusions selectively in neurons of affected brain regions. We 
      further provide evidence in vitro for a model of disease in which an expanded 
      polyglutamine-containing fragment recruits full-length protein into insoluble 
      aggregates. Together with recent findings from transgenic models, our results 
      suggest that intranuclear aggregation of the expanded protein is a unifying 
      feature of CAG/polyglutamine diseases and may be initiated or catalyzed by a 
      glutamine-containing fragment of the disease protein.

TI  - Studies of the CAG repeat in the Machado-Joseph disease gene in Taiwan.
PG  - 155-62
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      degeneration characterized by cerebellar ataxia and pyramidal signs associated in 
      varying degrees with a dystonic-rigid extrapyramidal syndrome or peripheral 
      amyotrophy. Unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the MJD gene on the 
      long arm of chromosome 14 has been identified as the pathological mutation for 
      MJD. While investigating the distribution of CAG repeat lengths of the MJD gene 
      in Taiwan's population, we have identified 18 MJD-affected patients and 12 
      at-risk individuals in seven families. In addition, we have analyzed the range of 
      CAG repeat lengths in 96 control individuals. The CAG repeat number ranged from 
      13 to 44 in the controls and 72-85 in the affected and at-risk individuals. Our 
      results indicated that the CAG repeat number was inversely correlated with the 
      age of onset. The differences in CAG repeat length between parent and child and 
      between siblings are greater with paternal transmission than maternal 
      transmission. Our data show a tendency towards the phenomenon of anticipation in 
      the MJD families but do not support unidirectional expansion of CAG repeats 
      during transmission. We also demonstrated that PCR amplification of the CAG 
      repeats in the MJD gene from villous DNA was possible and might prove useful as a 
      diagnostic tool for affected families in the future.

TI  - SCA2 trinucleotide expansion in German SCA patients.
PG  - 59-64
AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a group of clinically and 
      genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders which lead to progressive 
      cerebellar ataxia. A gene responsible for SCA type 2 has been mapped to human 
      chromosome 12 and the disease causing mutation has been identified as an unstable 
      and expanded (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat. We investigated the (CAG)n repeat 
      length of the SCA2 gene in 842 patients with sporadic ataxia and in 96 German 
      families with dominantly inherited SCA which do not harbor the SCA1 or MJD1/SCA3 
      mutation, respectively. The SCA2 (CAG)n expansion was identified in 71 patients 
      from 54 families. The (CAG)n stretch of the affected allele varied between 36 and 
      64 trinucleotide units. Significant repeat expansions occurred most commonly 
      during paternal transmission. Analysis of the (CAG)n repeat lengths with the age 
      of onset in 41 patients revealed an inverse correlation. Two hundred and 
      forty-one apparently healthy octogenerians carried alleles between 16 and 31 
      repeats. One 50-year old, healthy individual had 34 repeats; she had transmitted 
      an expanded allele to her child. The small difference between 'normal' and 
      disease alleles makes it necessary to define the extreme values of their ranges. 
      With one exception, the trinucleotide expansion was not observed in 842 ataxia 
      patients without a family history of the disease. The SCA2 mutation causes the 
      disease in nearly 14% of autosomal dominant SCA in Germany.

TI  - Brain regional differences in the expansion of a CAG repeat in the 
      spinocerebellar ataxias: dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, Machado-Joseph 
      disease, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.
PG  - 505-11
AB  - Three autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA), Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 
      (SCA1), are associated with the expansion of a CAG repeat in the respective 
      genes. To investigate the association between CAG repeat expansion and 
      neuropathological findings, we analyzed several brain regions from 9 cases of 
      DRPLA, 3 cases of MJD, and 1 case of SCA1. We found that the expanded alleles 
      were smaller in the cerebellar cortex than in other brain regions, such as the 
      frontal cortex, in these three diseases. The discrepancy in the expanded CAG 
      repeat length between cerebellar cortex and other tissues was most prominent in 
      DRPLA, and especially in cases of adult-onset DRPLA. A significant correlation 
      was found between the age at onset of DRPLA and the size of the CAG repeat 
      expansion. Cerebella of DRPLA patients were microscopically dissected into three 
      layers, the molecular and granular layers and the white matter, which were 
      analyzed separately. The lower level of CAG repeat expansion in DRPLA cerebella 
      was representative of CAG repeat expansion in the granule cells. The 
      microdissected samples of the granular layer of the hippocampal formation, which 
      is densely packed with neuronal cells, revealed that the degree of CAG repeat 
      expansion in this layer was similar to that in the cerebellum. These observations 
      suggest that granule cells in the cerebellum and hippocampus have low levels of 
      CAG repeat expansion, and that other types of cells exhibit a higher level of CAG 
      repeat expansion, in spinocerebellar ataxias.

TI  - The prevalence and wide clinical spectrum of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      trinucleotide repeat in patients with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 842-50
AB  - The dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) represent a clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of disorders linked by progressive deterioration in balance 
      and coordination. The utility of genetic classification of the ADCAs has been 
      highlighted by the striking variability in clinical phenotype observed within 
      families and the overlap in clinical phenotype observed between those with 
      different genotypes. The recent demonstration that spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      (SCA2) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion within the ataxin-2 gene has allowed 
      us to determine the frequency of SCA2 compared with SCA1, SCA3/Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD), and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) in patients with 
      sporadic and inherited ataxia. SCA2 accounts for 13% of patients with ADCA 
      (without retinal degeneration), intermediate between SCA1 and SCA3/MJD, which 
      account for 6% and 23%, respectively. Together, SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3/MJD 
      constitute >40% of the mutations leading to ADCA I in our population. No patient 
      without a family history of ataxia, or with a pure cerebellar or spastic 
      syndrome, tested positive for SCA1, SCA2, or SCA3. No overlap in ataxin-2 allele 
      size between normal and disease chromosomes, or intermediate-sized alleles, were 
      observed. Repeat length correlated inversely with age at onset, accounting for 
      approximately 80% of the variability in onset age. Haplotype analysis provided no 
      evidence for a single founder chromosome, and diverse ethnic origins were 
      observed among SCA2 kindreds. In addition, a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes 
      was observed among SCA2 patients, including typical mild dominant ataxia, the MJD 
      phenotype with facial fasciculations and lid retraction, and early-onset ataxia 
      with a rapid course, chorea, and dementia.

TI  - Non-Mendelian transmission at the Machado-Joseph disease locus in normal females: 
      preferential transmission of alleles with smaller CAG repeats.
PG  - 234-6
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, is a 
      neurodegenerative disorder which is associated with a CAG repeat expansion in the 
      MJD1 gene on chromosome 14q32.1. A recent study reported an excess of 
      transmission of disease chromosomes relative to normal chromosomes from affected 
      fathers, while this phenomenon was not observed in female meioses. These data 
      were compatible with meiotic drive. We investigated the transmission of alleles 
      with larger versus smaller CAG repeat numbers in the MJD1 gene in normal 
      heterozygotes from the 40 CEPH families. Our data suggest that there was no 
      segregation distortion in male meioses, while the smaller CAG allele was 
      inherited in 57% of female meioses (p < 0.016). The pattern of inheritance of 
      smaller versus larger CAG alleles at this locus was significantly different when 
      male and female meioses were compared (p = 0.0139). While previous data suggest 
      that meiotic drive may be a feature of certain human diseases, including the 
      trinucleotide diseases MJD, myotonic dystrophy, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy, these data are compatible with meiotic drive also occurring among 
      non-disease associated CAG sizes.

TI  - Estimated contribution of known ataxia genes in ataxia patients undergoing DNA 
      testing.
PG  - 275-8
AB  - We estimated the relative contributions of known ataxia genes (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 
      and X25) in the patient population sent to our DNA diagnostic laboratory for 
      diagnostic testing. Approximately 28% of these patients had an abnormal triplet 
      repeat expansion in one of these ataxia genes (3% for SCA1, 8% for SCA2, 11% for 
      SCA3/MJD, 2% for SCA6, 3% for SCA7, and 1.5% for X25). The lack of abnormal 
      repeat expansions in the majority of ataxis patients tested suggests that the 
      molecular defects associated with most ataxia cases are currently undetermined 
      and that this population includes both familial and sporadic cases. In contrast, 
      of the patients submitted for genetic testing for Friedrich's ataxia (FRDA), 44% 
      (69/157) showed at least one expansion in the X25 gene, indicating that FRDA 
      accounts for a significant proportion of the recessively inherited ataxias and 
      appears to have a high rate of accurate clinical diagnosis. On the basis of our 
      DNA studies, we propose a comprehensive and efficient approach for molecular 
      analysis of ataxia patients.

TI  - The repeat expansion detection method in the analysis of diseases with CAG/CTG 
      repeat expansion: usefulness and limitations.
PG  - 486-8
AB  - The repeat expansion detection (RED) method was described to detect expansions of 
      trinucleotide repeats of unknown chromosomal location. We have improved the RED 
      method by the use of 8-mer oligonucleotides and assessed its usefulness in 30 
      samples from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), Huntington's 
      disease (HD), and Machado Joseph's disease (MJD), for which the number of CAG/CTG 
      repeats was determined by sequencing. There was a good correlation between the 
      number of repeats detected by sequencing and those identified by RED. However, in 
      17% of samples, the RED gave additional fragments for ligation products of 
      different size than the CAG/CTG repeat expansion detected in the sample by 
      sequencing. The same was observed in a group of control subjects (n = 78) without 
      known clinical abnormalities in which products of more than 40 repeats were 
      detected in 27% of them, indicating that CAG/CTG repeat expansions are common in 
      the general population. Wether this corresponds to unidentified loci with 
      expansions deserves further investigation.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias in the Kinki area of Japan.
PG  - 399-406
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders characterized by slowly progressive cerebellar 
      ataxia. Recently, among the ataxias, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy have been 
      found to be caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the coding 
      region of the disease genes. We have analyzed the CAG repeats of 67 patients from 
      47 families with dominantly inherited ataxia who lived in the Kinki area of 
      Japan. The following results were obtained. First, 31 patients from 22 families 
      were found to be positive for the MJD repeat expansion, indicating that MJD is 
      the most common dominantly inherited ataxia in the Kinki area of Japan. Second, 
      no SCA1 repeat expansion was found among the families studied. This presents a 
      striking contrast to the fact that there are many families with SCA1 in Hokkaido 
      and the Tohoku area of Japan. These findings suggest geographic variation in 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias in Japan.

TI  - An expanded CAG repeat sequence in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7.
PG  - 965-71
AB  - Expanded CAG repeat sequences have been identified in the coding region of genes 
      mutated in several neurodegenerative disorders, including spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 1 and Machado-Joseph disease. In all disorders described to date the CAG 
      expansion codes for an elongated polyglutamine chain. An increased polyglutamine 
      chain size leads to a more severe disease, thus correlating with the genetic 
      anticipation seen in repeat expansion disorders. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 
      (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia with anticipation and a 
      progressive degeneration of the cerebellar cortex. Using repeat expansion 
      detection (RED), a method in which a thermostable ligase is used to detect repeat 
      expansions directly from genomic DNA, we have analyzed 8 SCA7 families for the 
      presence of CAG repeat expansions. RED products of 150-240 bp were found in all 
      affected individuals and found to cosegregate with the disease (P < 0.000001, n = 
      66), indicating strongly that a CAG expansion is the cause of SCA7. On the basis 
      of a previously established correlation between RED product sizes and actual 
      repeat sizes in Machado-Joseph disease, we were able to estimate the average 
      expansion size in SCA7 to be 64 CAG copies.

TI  - The relationship between trinucleotide repeat length and phenotypic variation in 
      Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 52-7
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansion in the Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) gene has been 
      found in 26 patients from 20 unrelated Japanese families. Expanded alleles had 68 
      to 84 repeats, whereas normal alleles had 14 to 37 repeats. The age of onset was 
      inversely correlated with the repeat length. To evaluate in detail the 
      relationship between the repeat length and clinical features, we subdivided the 
      26 patients into three groups on the basis of the repeat length (group 1, 78 
      repeats or more; group 2, 74 to 77 repeats; group 3, 73 repeats or less). Group 1 
      and group 2 had common features of spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, 
      bulging eyes, facial myokymia and extrapyramidal signs as well as cerebellar 
      ataxia and ophthalmoplegia. It should be noted that group 1 showed more prominent 
      pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs than group 2. In contrast, group 3 showed 
      hypotonia, hyporeflexia and sensory disturbance in addition to cerebellar ataxia 
      and ophthalmoplegia. These findings suggest that the repeat length plays an 
      important role in phenotypic variation. DNA analysis for the MJD mutation was 
      clearly useful for making an accurate diagnosis in patients without bulging eyes, 
      facial myokymia, dystonia or marked spasticity.

TI  - Electrophysiological findings in a Danish family with Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 743-50
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with autosomal 
      dominant inheritance, We have carried out electrophysiological studies in 8 
      individuals belonging to a Danish family with several affected members. Five had 
      an expanded trinucleotide (CAG) repeat sequence in the MJD1 gene on chromosome 14 
      indicating MJD, while 3 unaffected individuals had normal repeat lengths. Three 
      individuals with repeat expansion had clinical symptoms and signs of the Machado 
      or "type III" phenotype, whereas 2 had slight symptoms and signs only, 
      Electrophysiological evaluation included visual, somatosensory, and auditory 
      brain stem evoked potentials, quantitative electromyography, and nerve conduction 
      studies. In the patients with clinical MJD, evoked potential studies showed 
      multimodal abnormalities, electromyography showed neurogenic changes, and nerve 
      conduction studies showed signs of severe loss of motor and sensory nerve fibers. 
      Of the 2 patients with slight symptoms and signs, 1 had evidence of peripheral 
      and central affection, while the other had slight signs of a central affection. 
      This study provides insight into the distribution and character of 
      electrophysiological abnormalities in MJD of putative importance for an 
      understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, and for monitoring disease 
      progress, or the outcome of a possible treatment.

TI  - Non-Mendelian transmission in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and 
      Machado-Joseph disease: the mutant allele is preferentially transmitted in male 
      meiosis.
PG  - 730-3
AB  - Autosomal dominant dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) are neurodegenerative disorders caused by CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions. An inverse correlation of age at onset with the 
      length of the expanded CAG trinucleotide repeats has been demonstrated, and the 
      intergenerational instability of the length of the CAG trinucleotide repeats, 
      which is more prominent in paternal than in maternal transmissions, has been 
      shown to underlie the basic mechanisms of anticipation in DRPLA and MJD. Our 
      previous observations on DRPLA and MJD pedigrees, as well as a review of the 
      literature, have suggested that the numbers of affected offspring exceed those of 
      unaffected offspring, which is difficult to explain by the Mendelian principle of 
      random segregation of alleles. In the present study, we analyzed the segregation 
      patterns in 211 transmissions in 24 DRPLA pedigrees and 80 transmissions in 7 MJD 
      pedigrees, with the diagnoses confirmed by molecular testing. Significant 
      distortions in favor of transmission of the mutant alleles were found in male 
      meiosis, where the mutant alleles were transmitted to 62% of all offspring in 
      DRPLA (chi2 = 7.69; P<.01) and 73% in MJD (chi2 = 6.82; P<.01). The results were 
      consistent with meiotic drive in DRPLA and MJD. Since more prominent meiotic 
      instability of the length of the CAG trinucleotide repeats is observed in male 
      meiosis than in female meiosis and meiotic drive is observed only in male 
      meiosis, these results raise the possibility that a common molecular mechanism 
      underlies the meiotic drive and the meiotic instability in male meiosis.

TI  - Differential pattern in tissue-specific somatic mosaicism of expanded CAG 
      trinucleotide repeats in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, Machado-Joseph 
      disease, and X-linked recessive spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 43-50
AB  - We investigated the somatic mosaicism of trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 
      neural and nonneural tissues of a dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) 
      patient and their correlation to the topographical distribution of the 
      pathological involvement. The spatial pattern of tissue-specific somatic 
      mosaicism in the CAG repeat size was significantly different among the DRPLA, MJD 
      and SBMA patients. The size of the major bands of the mutant CAG repeat allele 
      was significantly smaller in the cerebellar cortex in both DRPLA and MJD patients 
      by 6 and 2 repeat units respectively and larger in the colon and liver of DRPLA 
      by 5 repeats or more. There were also 1-2 repeat-sized small variations of major 
      band size among the neural tissues in DRPLA. In contrast, there was no 
      tissue-specific variation of major bands of CAG repeats and diversity of extra 
      bands among the examined tissues including the cerebellum in the SBMA patient. 
      There was no parallel occurrence of tissue-specific CAG instability and severity 
      of neuropathological involvement in the neural and nonneural tissues of DRPLA, 
      MJD and SBMA patients. Lack of significant tissue-specific somatic mosaicism in 
      SBMA including the cerebellar cortex may suggest that CAG repeat expansion in the 
      mutant androgen receptor gene is far more stable compared with that in DRPLA and 
      MJD as well as those reported in Huntington's disease.

TI  - Mutation detection in Machado-Joseph disease using repeat expansion detection.
PG  - 77-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several neurological disorders have recently been explained through 
      the discovery of expanded DNA repeat sequences. Among these is Machado-Joseph 
      disease, one of the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (MJD/SCA3), caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion on chromosome 14. A useful way of detecting repeat sequence 
      mutations is offered by the repeat expansion detection method (RED), in which a 
      thermostable ligase is used to detect repeat expansions directly from genomic 
      DNA. We have used RED to detect CAG expansions in families with either MJD/SCA3 
      or with previously uncharacterized spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Five MJD/SCA3 families and one SCA family where linkage to SCA1-5 had 
      been excluded were analyzed by RED and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: 
      An expansion represented by RED products of 180-270 bp segregated with MJD/SCA3 
      (p < 0.00001) in five families (n = 60) and PCR products corresponding to 66-80 
      repeat copies were observed in all affected individuals. We also detected a 
      210-bp RED product segregating with disease (p < 0.01) in a non-SCA1-5 family (n 
      = 16), suggesting involvement of a CAG expansion in the pathophysiology. PCR 
      analysis subsequently revealed an elongated MJD/SCA3 allele in all affected 
      family members. CONCLUSIONS: RED products detected in Machado-Joseph disease 
      families correlated with elongated PCR products at the MJD/SCA3 locus. We 
      demonstrate the added usefulness of RED in detecting repeat expansions in 
      disorders where linkage is complicated by phenotyping problems in gradually 
      developing adult-onset disorders, as in the non-SCA1-5 family examined. The RED 
      method is informative without any knowledge of flanking sequences. This is 
      particularly useful when studying diseases where the mutated gene is unknown. We 
      conclude that RED is a reliable method for analyzing expanded repeat sequences in 
      the genome.

TI  - Frequency of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy, 
      and Machado-Joseph disease mutations in a large group of spinocerebellar ataxia 
      patients.
PG  - 214-8
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders varying in both clinical manifestations and mode of inheritance. Six 
      different genes causing autosomal dominant SCA are mapped: SCA1, SCA2, 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA4, SCA5, and dentatorubropallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA). Expansions of an unstable trinucleotide CAG repeat cause three 
      of these disorders: SCA type 1 (SCA1), MJD, and DRPLA. We determine the frequency 
      of the SCA1, DRPLA, and MJD mutations in a large group of unrelated SCA patients 
      with various patterns of inheritance and different ethnic backgrounds. We studied 
      92 unrelated SCA patients. The frequency of the SCA1 mutation was 3% in the 
      overall patient group and 10% in the non-Portuguese dominantly inherited SCA 
      subgroup. We found that DRPLA mutation in only one Japanese patient, who was 
      previously diagnosed with this disease. We identified the MJD mutation in 41% of 
      the overall patient group, which included 38 autosomal dominant kindreds of 
      Portuguese origin; the frequency of the MJD mutation among the non-Portuguese 
      dominantly inherited cases was 17%. These results suggest that SCA may be 
      occasionally caused by the SCA1 mutation and rarely caused by the DRPLA mutation 
      and that, to date, the MJD mutation seems to be the most common cause of 
      dominantly inherited SCA. Finally, our results suggest that recessively inherited 
      cases of SCA are not caused by the known trinucleotide repeat expansions.

TI  - Mutations in American families with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 3: SCA3 is 
      allelic to Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 208-13
AB  - We identified an expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the coding region 
      of the Machado-Joseph disease gene in 7 of 24 American families diagnosed with 
      autosomal dominant ataxia. All affected individuals were heterozygous for an 
      expanded allele that ranged from 67 to more than 200 CAG repeats, whereas the 
      normal allele had 14 to 33 repeats. In contrast to the Azorean-Portuguese origins 
      of Machado-Joseph disease, the two largest American families were of German and 
      Dutch-African descent. Clinical, pathologic, and genetic evaluations suggest that 
      American families with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 differ from those with 
      Machado-Joseph disease by their ethnic origins, predominant spinopontine atrophy, 
      lack of dystonic features, and larger CAG repeat expansion.

      repeat instability for parental transmission, and correlation with disease 
      phenotype.
PG  - 128-33
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is caused by abnormal expansion of an unstable CAG 
      repeat in a novel gene locating on chromosome 14q32.1. We analysed this CAG 
      repeat polymorphism with 66 Japanese MJD patients. All the patients were 
      selectively associated with abnormal expansion of the CAG repeat. Repeat length 
      of the mutant allele did not overlap that of normal allele and closely correlated 
      with not only age at onset but also with clinical phenotypes. CAG repeat size is 
      apparently related to a wide variety of phenotypic presentations in MJD.

TI  - Detection of the Machado-Joseph disease/spinocerebellar ataxia three 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in families with autosomal dominant motor 
      disorders, including the Drew family of Walworth.
PG  - 1077-85
AB  - Affected members of 63 families with a variety of autosomal dominant late onset 
      cerebellar ataxias (ADCA), and 29 patients with similar phenotypes but no 
      affected relatives, were investigated for the trinucleotide (CAG) repeat 
      expansion described in Japanese families with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). This 
      disorder had previously been shown to map to the region of chromosome 14 which 
      also contains a locus causing ADCA in French families, spinocerebellar ataxia 3 
      (SCA3). The MJD/SCA3 mutation was identified in nine families with ADCA type I, 
      and a further family in which affected members had parkinsonism, peripheral 
      neuropathy, dystonia, and spasticity, but little evidence of cerebellar disease. 
      Only one of the 10 families was British (the Drew family of Walworth); the others 
      originated from India, Jamaica, Ghana, Brazil and France. There was no single 
      clinical feature which distinguished patients with the MJD/SCA3 mutation from 
      those with the CAG expansion on chromosome 6 (SCA1) or ADCA type I families with 
      no known mutation. The CAG repeat length ranged from 13-41 copies on normal 
      chromosomes and 62-80 copies on affected chromosomes. There was a significant 
      inverse correlation between age of onset of symptoms and repeat length, but no 
      significant effect of parental sex on repeat length or age of onset in offspring. 
      DNA analysis for the MJD/SCA3 mutation is useful for diagnosis in patients with 
      familial ataxic or extrapyramidal syndromes, and will aid genetic counselling in 
      these disorders.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia, type 3 (SCA3) is genetically identical to Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD).
PG  - 71-5
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia, type 3 (SCA3) and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) are two 
      clinically distinct representatives of the heterogeneous group of autosomal 
      dominant cerebellar ataxias. Assignment of the disease genes to the same region 
      of the long arm of chromosome 14 in both SCA3 and MJD suggested that these two 
      disorders are genetically identical. The recent identification of a trinucleotide 
      (CAG) repeat expansion in a gene underlying MJD facilitates assessment of this 
      hypothesis. We analysed the MJD gene in members of a family with characteristic 
      features of SCA3 and no symptoms typical of MJD. We found the same trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion within the gene that was previously described in patients with 
      MJD. The findings demonstrate that SCA3 and MJD are genetically identical in 
      spite of their pronounced clinical differences. Furthermore, we demonstrate a 
      striking variation in the copy number of the CAG repeat among affected members of 
      the same family.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 and Machado-Joseph disease: incidence of CAG 
      expansions among adult-onset ataxia patients from 311 families with dominant, 
      recessive, or sporadic ataxia.
PG  - 603-8
AB  - The ataxias are a complex group of diseases with both environmental and genetic 
      causes. Among the autosomal dominant forms of ataxia the genes for two, 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), have been 
      isolated. In both of these disorders the molecular basis of disease is the 
      expansion of an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat. To assess the frequency of the 
      SCA1 and MJD trinucleotide repeat expansions among individuals diagnosed with 
      ataxia we have collected DNA from individuals representing 311 families with 
      adult-onset ataxia of unknown etiology and screened these samples for 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions within the SCA1 and MJD genes. Within this group 
      there are 149 families with dominantly inherited ataxia. Of these, 3% had SCA1 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions, whereas 21% were positive for the MJD 
      trinucleotide expansion. Thus, together SCA1 and MJD represent 24% of the 
      autosomal dominant ataxias in our group, and the frequency of MJD is 
      substantially greater than that of SCA1. For the 57 patients with MJD 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions, a strong inverse correlation between CAG repeat 
      size and age at onset was observed (r = -.838). Among the MJD patients, the 
      normal and affected ranges of CAG repeat size are 14-40 and 68-82 repeats, 
      respectively. For SCA1 the normal and affected ranges are much closer, containing 
      19-38 and 40-81 CAG repeats, respectively.

TI  - Molecular and clinical correlations in spinocerebellar ataxia type I: evidence 
      for familial effects on the age at onset.
PG  - 244-52
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias are a group of debilitating neurodegenerative 
      diseases for which a clinical classification system has proved unreliable. We 
      have recently isolated the gene for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and have 
      shown that the disease is caused by an expanded, unstable, CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat within an expressed gene. Normal alleles have a size range of 19-36 
      repeats, while SCA1 alleles have 42-81 repeats. In this study, we examined the 
      frequency and variability of the SCA1 repeat expansion in 87 kindreds with 
      diverse ethnic backgrounds and dominantly inherited ataxia. All nine families for 
      which linkage to the SCA1 region of 6p had previously been established showed 
      repeat expansion, while 3 of the remaining 78 showed a similar abnormality. For 
      113 patients from the families with repeat expansion, inverse correlations 
      between CAG repeat size and both age at onset and disease duration were observed. 
      Repeat size accounted for 66% of the variation in age at onset in these patients. 
      After correction for repeat size, interfamilial differences in age at onset 
      remained significant, suggesting that additional genetic factors affect the 
      expression of the SCA1 gene product.
