TI  - Fragile X syndrome in the largest world clustering. I. Genetic epidemiology and 
      founder effect outline.
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.63523 [doi]
AB  - The FMR1 5' regulation gene region harbors a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      (CGG-TRE) that causes Fragile X syndrome (FXS) when it expands to more than 200 
      repetitions. Ricaurte is a small village in southwestern Colombia, with an FXS 
      prevalence of 1 in 38 men and 1 in 100 women (~100 times higher than the 
      worldwide reported prevalence), defining Ricaurte as the largest FXS cluster in 
      the world. In the present study, using next-generation sequencing of whole exome 
      capture, we genotype 55 individuals from Ricaurte (49 with either full mutation 
      or with premutation), four individuals from neighboring villages (with either the 
      full mutation or with the premutation), and one unaffected woman, native of 
      Ricaurte, who did not belong to any of the affected families. With advanced 
      clustering and haplotype reconstruction, we modeled a common haplotype of 33 SNPs 
      spanning 83,567,899 bp and harboring the FMR1 gene. This reconstructed haplotype 
      was found in all the men from Ricaurte who carried the expansion, demonstrating 
      that the genetic conglomerate of FXS in this population is due to a founder 
      effect. The definition of this founder effect and its population outlining will 
      allow a better prediction, follow-up, precise and personalized characterization 
      of epidemiological parameters, better knowledge of the disease's natural history, 
      and confident improvement of the clinical attention, life quality, and health 
      interventions for this community.

TI  - Digital gait markers to potentially distinguish fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome, Parkinson's disease, and essential tremor.
PG  - 1308698
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2023.1308698 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a 
      neurodegenerative disease that affects carriers of a 55-200 CGG repeat expansion 
      in the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene, may be given an 
      incorrect initial diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) or essential tremor (ET) 
      due to overlapping motor symptoms. It is critical to characterize distinct 
      phenotypes in FXTAS compared to PD and ET to improve diagnostic accuracy. Fast as 
      possible (FP) speed and dual-task (DT) paradigms have the potential to 
      distinguish differences in gait performance between the three movement disorders. 
      Therefore, we sought to compare FXTAS, PD, and ET patients using quantitative 
      measures of functional mobility and gait under self-selected (SS) speed, FP, and 
      DT conditions. METHODS: Participants with FXTAS (n = 22), PD (n = 23), ET 
      (n = 20), and controls (n = 20) underwent gait testing with an inertial sensor 
      system (APDM()). An instrumented Timed Up and Go test (i-TUG) was used to 
      measure movement transitions, and a 2-min walk test (2MWT) was used to measure 
      gait and turn variables under SS, FP, and DT conditions, and dual-task costs 
      (DTC) were calculated. ANOVA and multinomial logistic regression analyses were 
      performed. RESULTS: PD participants had reduced stride lengths compared to FXTAS 
      and ET participants under SS and DT conditions, longer turn duration than ET 
      participants during the FP task, and less arm symmetry than ET participants in SS 
      gait. They also had greater DTC for stride length and velocity compared to FXTAS 
      participants. On the i-TUG, PD participants had reduced sit-to-stand peak 
      velocity compared to FXTAS and ET participants. Stride length and arm symmetry 
      index during the DT 2MWT was able to distinguish FXTAS and ET from PD, such that 
      participants with shorter stride lengths were more likely to have a diagnosis of 
      PD and those with greater arm asymmetry were more likely to be diagnosed with PD. 
      No gait or i-TUG parameters distinguished FXTAS from ET participants in the 
      regression model. CONCLUSION: This is the first quantitative study demonstrating 
      distinct gait and functional mobility profiles in FXTAS, PD, and ET which may 
      assist in more accurate and timely diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is mainly caused by FMR1 CGG repeat 
      expansions. Other types of mutations, particularly deletions, are also 
      responsible for FXS phenotypes, however these mutations are often missed by 
      routine clinical testing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Molecular diagnosis in cases of 
      suspected FXS was a combination of PCR and Southern blot. Measurement of the FMRP 
      protein level was useful for detecting potentially deleterious impact. RESULTS: 
      PCR analysis and Southern blot revealed a case with premutation and suspected 
      deletion alleles. Sanger sequencing showed that the deletion involved 313 bp 
      upstream of repeats and some parts of CGG repeat tract, leaving transcription 
      start site. FMRP was detected in 5.5 % of blood lymphocytes. CONCLUSION: 
      According to our review of case reports, most patients carrying microdeletion and 
      full mutation had typical features of FXS. To our knowledge, our case is the 
      first to describe mosaicism of a premutation and microdeletion in the FMR1 gene. 
      The patient was probably protected from the effects of the deletion by mosaicism 
      with premutation allele, leading to milder phenotype. It is thus important to 
      consider appropriate techniques for detecting FMR1 variants other than repeat 
      expansions which cannot be detected by routine FXS diagnosis.

AB  - Short tandem repeat (STR) instability causes transcriptional silencing in several 
      repeat expansion disorders. In fragile X syndrome (FXS), mutation-length 
      expansion of a CGG STR represses FMR1 via local DNA methylation. Here, we find 
      megabase-scale H3K9me3 domains on autosomes and encompassing FMR1 on the X 
      chromosome in FXS patient-derived iPSCs, iPSC-derived neural progenitors, 
      EBV-transformed lymphoblasts, and brain tissue with mutation-length CGG 
      expansion. H3K9me3 domains connect via inter-chromosomal interactions and 
      demarcate severe misfolding of TADs and loops. They harbor long synaptic genes 
      replicating at the end of S phase, replication-stress-induced double-strand 
      breaks, and STRs prone to stepwise somatic instability. CRISPR engineering of the 
      mutation-length CGG to premutation length reverses H3K9me3 on the X chromosome 
      and multiple autosomes, refolds TADs, and restores gene expression. H3K9me3 
      domains can also arise in normal-length iPSCs created with perturbations linked 
      to genome instability, suggesting their relevance beyond FXS. Our results reveal 
      Mb-scale heterochromatinization and trans interactions among loci susceptible to 
      instability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is primarily due to CGG repeat expansions in 
      the FMR1 gene. FMR1 alleles are classified as normal (N), intermediate (I), 
      premutation (PM), and full mutation (FM). FXS patients often carry an FM, but 
      size mosaicism can occur. Additionally, loss of methylation boundary upstream of 
      repeats results in de novo methylation spreading to FMR1 promoter in FXS 
      patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This pilot study investigated the 
      methylation boundary and adjacent regions in 66 males with typical and atypical 
      FXS aged 1 to 30 years (10.86 +/- 6.48 years). AmplideX FMR1 mPCR kit was used to 
      discriminate allele profiles and methylation levels. CpG sites were assessed by 
      pyrosequencing. RESULTS: 40 out of 66 FXS patients (60.6%) showed an exclusive FM 
      (n = 40), whereas the remaining (n = 26) exhibited size mosaicism [10 PM_FM 
      (15.15%); 10 N_FM (15.15%); 2 N_PM_FM (3%)]. Four patients (6.1%) had deletions 
      near repeats. Noteworthy, a CpG within FMR1 intron 2 displayed hypomethylation in 
      FXS patients and hypermethylation in controls, demonstrating remarkable 
      specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy when a methylation threshold of 69.5% was 
      applied. CONCLUSIONS: Since intragenic methylation is pivotal in gene regulation, 
      the intronic CpG might be a novel epigenetic biomarker for FXS diagnosis.

LID - 42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a leading cause of autism spectrum 
      disorder (ASD) and resulted from a loss of the FMR1-encoded fragile X messenger 
      ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP) protein due to large CGG repeat expansions in the 
      promoter region of the FMR1 gene. The microtubule-associated protein Tau is a 
      promising target for Tauopathic diseases and our preliminary study found that Tau 
      protein levels were increased in the brain of Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, a model of 
      FXS. However, whether Tau reduction can prevent autism-like features in Fmr1 KO 
      mice and become a novel strategy for FXS treatment remain unknown. METHODS: Tau 
      was genetically reduced in Fmr1 KO mice through crossing Fmr1(+/-) female mice with 
      Mapt(+/-) male mice. The male offspring with different genotypes were subjected to 
      various autism-related behavioral tests, RNA sequencing, and biochemical 
      analysis. Fmr1 KO male mice were treated with Tau-targeting antisense 
      oligonucleotide (ASO) and then subjected to behavioral tests and biochemical 
      analysis. RESULTS: Tau expression was increased in the cortex of Fmr1 KO mice. 
      Genetically reducing Tau prevented social defects, stereotyped and repetitive 
      behavior, and spine abnormality in Fmr1 KO mice. Tau reduction also reversed 
      increased periodic activity and partially rescued Per1 expression reduction in 
      Fmr1 KO mice. Moreover, Tau reduction reversed compromised P38/MAPK signaling in 
      Fmr1 KO mice. Finally, Tau-targeting ASO also effectively alleviated autism-like 
      phenotypes and promoted P38/MAPK signaling in Fmr1 KO mice. LIMITATIONS: Our 
      study is limited to male mice, in agreement with the higher incidence of FXS in 
      males than females. Whether Tau reduction also exerts protection in females 
      deserves further scrutiny. Moreover, although Tau reduction rescues impaired 
      P38/MAPK signaling in Fmr1 KO mice, whether this is the responsible molecular 
      mechanism requires further determination. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that Tau 
      reduction prevents autism-like phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice. Tau may become a new 
      target for FXS treatment.

TI  - The Frequency of Intermediate Alleles in Patients with Cerebellar Phenotypes.
LID - 10.1007/s12311-023-01620-7 [doi]
AB  - Cerebellar syndromes are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and can be 
      classified as hereditary, neurodegenerative non-hereditary, or acquired. Few data 
      are available on the frequency of each form in the clinical setting. Growing 
      interest is emerging regarding the genetic forms caused by triplet repeat 
      expansions. Alleles with repeat expansion lower than the pathological threshold, 
      termed intermediate alleles (IAs), have been found to be associated with disease 
      manifestation. In order to assess the relevance of IAs as a cause of cerebellar 
      syndromes, we enrolled 66 unrelated Italian ataxic patients and described the 
      distribution of the different etiology of their syndromes and the frequency of 
      IAs. Each patient underwent complete clinical, hematological, and 
      neurophysiological assessments, neuroimaging evaluations, and genetic tests for 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (SCA) and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome (FXTAS). We identified the following diagnostic categories: 28% sporadic 
      adult-onset ataxia, 18% cerebellar variant of multiple system atrophy, 9% 
      acquired forms, 9% genetic forms with full-range expansion, and 12% cases with 
      intermediate-range expansion. The IAs were six in the FMR1 gene, two in the gene 
      responsible for SCA8, and one in the ATXN2 gene. The clinical phenotype of 
      patients carrying the IAs resembles, in most of the cases, the one associated 
      with full-range expansion. Our study provides an exhaustive description of the 
      causes of cerebellar ataxia, estimating for the first time the frequency of IAs 
      in SCAs- and FXTAS-associated genes. The high percentage of cases with IAs 
      supports further screening among patients with cerebellar syndromes.

TI  - Trehalose consumption ameliorates pathogenesis in an inducible mouse model of the 
      Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1080/1028415X.2023.2261682 [doi]
AB  - Trehalose is a naturally occurring sugar found in various food and pharmaceutical 
      preparations with the ability to enhance cellular proteostasis and reduce the 
      formation of toxic intracellular protein aggregates, making it a promising 
      therapeutic candidate for various neurodegenerative disorders. OBJECTIVES: Here, 
      we explored the effectiveness of nutritional trehalose supplementation in 
      ameliorating symptoms in a mouse model of Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome (FXTAS), an incurable late onset manifestation of moderately expanded 
      trinucleotide CGG repeat expansion mutations in the 5' untranslated region of the 
      fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 gene (FMR1). METHODS: An inducible mouse 
      model of FXTAS expressing 90 CGG repeats in the brain had been previously 
      developed, which faithfully captures hallmarks of the disorder, the formation of 
      intracellular inclusions, and the disturbance of motor function. Taking advantage 
      of the inducible nature of the model, we investigated the therapeutic potential 
      of orally administered trehalose under two regimens, modelling disease prevention 
      and disease treatment. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Trehalose's effectiveness in 
      combating protein aggregation is frequently attributed to its ability to induce 
      autophagy. Accordingly, trehalose supplementation under the prevention regimen 
      ameliorated the formation of intranuclear inclusions and improved the motor 
      deficiencies resulting from the induced expression of 90 CGG repeats, but it 
      failed to reverse the existing nuclear pathology as a treatment strategy. Given 
      the favorable safety profile of trehalose, it is promising to further explore the 
      potential of this agent for early stage FXTAS.

TI  - Large-Scale Whole Genome Sequence Analysis of >22,000 Subjects Provides no 
      Evidence of FMR1 Premutation Allele Involvement in Autism Spectrum Disorder.
LID - 10.3390/genes14081518 [doi]
LID - 1518
AB  - Expansion of a CGG repeat in the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) 
      gene on the X chromosome is the cause of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). The repeat 
      length of unaffected individuals varies between 5-40 repeats, whereas >200 
      repeats are observed in cases of FXS. The intermediate range between 55-200 
      repeats is considered the premutation range and is observed in roughly 1:300 
      females and 1:900 males in the general population. With the availability of 
      large-scale whole genome sequence (WGS) data and the development of computational 
      tools to detect repeat expansions, we systematically examined the role of FMR1 
      premutation alleles in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) susceptibility, assess the 
      prevalence, and consider the allelic stability between parents and offspring. We 
      analyzed the WGS data of 22,053 subjects, including 32 FXS positive controls, 
      1359 population controls, and 5467 ASD families. We observed no FMR1 full 
      mutation range repeats among the ASD parent-offspring families but identified 180 
      family members with premutation range alleles, which represents a higher 
      prevalence compared to the independent WGS control sample and previous reports in 
      the literature. A sex-specific analysis between probands and unaffected siblings 
      did not reveal a significant increase in the burden of premutation alleles in 
      either males or females with ASD. PCR validation, however, suggests an 
      overestimation of the frequency of FMR1 premutation range alleles through 
      computational analysis of WGS data. Overall, we show the utility of large-scale 
      repeat expansion screening in WGS data and conclude that there is no apparent 
      evidence of FMR1 premutation alleles contributing to ASD susceptibility.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is controversial evidence that FMR1 premutation or "gray zone" 
      (GZ) allele (small CGG expansion, 45-54 repeats) was associated with Parkinson's 
      disease (PD). We aimed to explore further the association between FMR1 CGG repeat 
      expansions and PD in a large sample of Chinese origin. METHODS: We included a 
      cohort of 2,362 PD patients and 1,072 controls from the Parkinson's Disease and 
      Movement Disorders Multicenter Database and Collaborative Network in China 
      (PD-MDCNC) in this study and conducted repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction 
      (RP-PCR) for the size of FMR1 CGG repeat expansions. RESULTS: Two PD patients 
      were detected with FMR1 premutation (61 and 56 repeats), and the other eleven PD 
      patients were detected with the GZ allele of FMR1 CGG repeat expansions. Those 
      thirteen PD patients responded well to levodopa and were diagnosed with 
      clinically established PD. Specifically, one female PD patient with GZ allele was 
      also found with premature ovarian failure. However, compared to healthy controls, 
      we found no significant enrichment of GZ allele carriers in PD patients or other 
      subgroups of PD cases, including the subgroups of female, male, early-onset, and 
      late-onset PD patients. Furthermore, we did not find any correlation between the 
      FMR1 gene CGG repeat sizes and age at onset of PD. CONCLUSION: It suggested that 
      FMR1 premutation was related to PD, but the GZ allele of FMR1 CGG repeat 
      expansions was not significantly enriched in PD cases of Chinese origin. Further 
      larger multiple ethnic studies are needed to determine further the role of the 
      FMR1 GZ allele in PD.

TI  - Cochlear Nucleus Transcriptome of a Fragile X Mouse Model Reveals Candidate Genes 
      for Hyperacusis.
LID - 10.1002/lary.30936 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a hereditary form of autism spectrum 
      disorder. It is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the Fmr1 gene, 
      leading to a loss of Fragile X Protein (FMRP) expression. The loss of FMRP causes 
      auditory hypersensitivity: FXS patients display hyperacusis and the Fmr1- 
      knock-out (KO) mouse model for FXS exhibits auditory seizures. FMRP is strongly 
      expressed in the cochlear nucleus and other auditory brainstem nuclei. We 
      hypothesize that the Fmr1-KO mouse has altered gene expression in the cochlear 
      nucleus that may contribute to auditory hypersensitivity. METHODS: RNA was 
      isolated from cochlear nuclei of Fmr1-KO and WT mice. Using next-generation 
      sequencing (RNA-seq), the transcriptomes of Fmr1-KO mice and WT mice (n = 3 each) 
      were compared and analyzed using gene ontology programs. RESULTS: We identified 
      270 unique, differentially expressed genes between Fmr1-KO and WT cochlear 
      nuclei. Upregulated genes (67%) are enriched in those encoding secreted 
      molecules. Downregulated genes (33%) are enriched in neuronal function, including 
      synaptic pathways, some of which are ideal candidate genes that may contribute to 
      hyperacusis. CONCLUSION: The loss of FMRP can affect the expression of genes in 
      the cochlear nucleus that are important for neuronal signaling. One of these, 
      Kcnab2, which encodes a subunit of the Shaker voltage-gated potassium channel, is 
      expressed at an abnormally low level in the Fmr1-KO cochlear nucleus. Kcnab2 and 
      other differentially expressed genes may represent pathways for the development 
      of hyperacusis. Future studies will be aimed at investigating the effects of 
      these altered genes on hyperacusis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level N/A Laryngoscope,

LID - 10.18502/ijph.v52i4.12438 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disease with intellectual 
      disabilities. FXS is often caused by the CGG-repeat expansion mutation in the 
      FMR1 gene with suppressed FMR1 transcription and decreased protein levels in the 
      brain of the patients. The RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 system is a promising targeted 
      genomic editing tool in gene therapy of FXS. In order to evaluate its 
      feasibility, the present study used CRISPR/Cas9 system to target the FMR1 5'-UTR 
      sites in cultured human neuroblastoma cells. METHODS: PCR and DNA clone were used 
      to construct plasmids. CRISPR function was tested by Western blot and flow 
      cytometry. Data were analyzed by a two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test using 
      GraphPad software. This research was conducted from 2020 to 2022 in the Second 
      Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. RESULTS: Cell cycle 
      analysis showed significant differences in G1, S and G2/M phases between the two 
      groups (P<0.05). In the knockout cells, apoptosis was accelerated (P<0.05) with a 
      significantly down-regulated (P<0.05) expression of FMRP as compared with the 
      control group. CONCLUSION: This study provides further understanding about the 
      FMRP function and molecular mechanism of FMR1 gene in nerve cells, and suggests 
      the feasibility of gene therapy in FXS by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system.

AB  - Brain changes at the end-stage of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS) are largely unknown due to mobility impairment. We conducted a postmortem 
      MRI study of FXTAS to quantify cerebrovascular disease, brain atrophy and iron 
      content, and examined their relationships using principal component analysis 
      (PCA). Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) was observed in 4/17 FXTAS cases, among 
      which one was confirmed by histologic staining. Compared with seven control 
      brains, FXTAS cases showed higher ratings of T2-hyperintensities (indicating 
      cerebral small vessel disease) in the cerebellum, globus pallidus and 
      frontoparietal white matter, and significant atrophy in the cerebellar white 
      matter, red nucleus and dentate nucleus. PCA of FXTAS cases revealed negative 
      associations of T2-hyperintensity ratings with anatomic volumes and iron content 
      in the white matter, hippocampus and amygdala, that were independent from a 
      highly correlated number of regions with ICH and iron content in subcortical 
      nuclei. Post-hoc analysis confirmed PCA findings and further revealed increased 
      iron content in the white matter, hippocampus and amygdala in FXTAS cases 
      compared to controls, after adjusting for T2-hyperintensity ratings. These 
      findings indicate that both ischemic and hemorrhagic brain damage may occur in 
      FXTAS, with the former being marked by demyelination/iron depletion and atrophy, 
      and the latter by ICH and iron accumulation in basal ganglia.

AB  - Neurodegeneration in Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is 
      caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of FMR1. Expanded 
      CGG repeat RNAs form stable secondary structures, which in turn support 
      repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation to produce toxic peptides. The 
      parameters that impact RAN translation initiation efficiency are not well 
      understood. Here we used a Drosophila melanogaster model of FXTAS to evaluate the 
      role of the eIF4G family of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (EIF4G1, 
      EIF4GII and EIF4G2/DAP5) in modulating RAN translation and CGG repeat-associated 
      toxicity. DAP5 knockdown robustly suppressed CGG repeat-associated toxicity and 
      inhibited RAN translation. Furthermore, knockdown of initiation factors that 
      preferentially associate with DAP5 (such as EIF2beta, EIF3F and EIF3G) also 
      selectively suppressed CGG repeat-induced eye degeneration. In mammalian cellular 
      reporter assays, DAP5 knockdown exhibited modest and cell-type specific effects 
      on RAN translation. Taken together, these data support a role for DAP5 in CGG 
      repeat associated toxicity possibly through modulation of RAN translation.

AB  - Here, we describe an approach to correct the genetic defect in fragile X syndrome 
      (FXS) via recruitment of endogenous repair mechanisms. A leading cause of autism 
      spectrum disorders, FXS results from epigenetic silencing of FMR1 due to a 
      congenital trinucleotide (CGG) repeat expansion. By investigating conditions 
      favorable to FMR1 reactivation, we find MEK and BRAF inhibitors that induce a 
      strong repeat contraction and full FMR1 reactivation in cellular models. We trace 
      the mechanism to DNA demethylation and site-specific R-loops, which are necessary 
      and sufficient for repeat contraction. A positive feedback cycle comprising 
      demethylation, de novo FMR1 transcription, and R-loop formation results in the 
      recruitment of endogenous DNA repair mechanisms that then drive excision of the 
      long CGG repeat. Repeat contraction is specific to FMR1 and restores the 
      production of FMRP protein. Our study therefore identifies a potential method of 
      treating FXS in the future.

AB  - Pathogenic short tandem repeat (STR) expansions cause over 20 neurodegenerative 
      diseases. To determine the contribution of STRs in sporadic amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), we used ExpansionHunter, 
      REviewer, and polymerase chain reaction validation to assess 21 neurodegenerative 
      disease-associated STRs in whole-genome sequencing data from 608 patients with 
      sporadic ALS, 68 patients with sporadic FTD, and 4703 matched controls. We also 
      propose a data-derived outlier detection method for defining allele thresholds in 
      rare STRs. Excluding C9orf72 repeat expansions, 17.6% of clinically diagnosed ALS 
      and FTD cases had at least one expanded STR allele reported to be pathogenic or 
      intermediate for another neurodegenerative disease. We identified and validated 
      162 disease-relevant STR expansions in C9orf72 (ALS/FTD), ATXN1 [spinal 
      cerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1)], ATXN2 (SCA2), ATXN8 (SCA8), TBP (SCA17), HTT 
      (Huntington's disease), DMPK [myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)], CNBP (DM2), and 
      FMR1 (fragile-X disorders). Our findings suggest clinical and pathological 
      pleiotropy of neurodegenerative disease genes and highlight their importance in 
      ALS and FTD.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited intellectual disability. 
      FXS is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region 
      of the FMR1 gene, which leads to gene methylation, transcriptional silencing, and 
      lack of expression of Fragile X Messenger Riboprotein (FMRP). Currently available 
      FXS therapies are inefficient, and the disease severity is highly variable, 
      making it difficult to predict disease trajectory and treatment response. We and 
      others have recently shown that a subset of full-mutation, fully-methylated 
      (FM-FM) males with FXS express low amounts of FMRP which could contribute to 
      phenotypic variability. To better understand the underlying mechanisms, we 
      developed a sensitive qRT-PCR assay to detect FMR1 mRNA in blood. This assay 
      reproducibly detects trace amounts of FMR1 mRNA in a subset of FM-FM males, 
      suggesting that current Southern Blot and PCR determination of FM-FM status is 
      not always associated with complete transcriptional silencing. The functional 
      relevance of trace-level FMR1 mRNA is confirmed by showing a positive correlation 
      with cognitive function; however, phenotypic variability is not fully explained 
      by FMR1 expression. These results corroborate the need for better molecular 
      assays for FXS diagnosis and encourage studies to elucidate the factors 
      contributing to the phenotypic variability of FXS.

      spectrum in female FMR1 premutation carriers: A pilot study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is rare genetic condition characterized by 
      a repeat expansion (CGG) in the Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) 
      gene where individuals with greater than 200 repeats are defined as full 
      mutation. FXS clinical presentation often includes intellectual disability, and 
      autism-like symptoms, including anxiety and sensory hypersensitivities. 
      Individuals with 55 to <200 CGG repeats are said to have the FMR1 premutation, 
      which is not associated with primary characteristics of the full mutation, but 
      with an increased risk for anxiety, depression, and other affective conditions, 
      as well as and impaired cognitive processing differences that vary in severity. 
      Defining subgroups of premutation carriers based on distinct biological features 
      may identify subgroups with varying levels of psychiatric, cognitive, and 
      behavioral alterations. METHODS: The current pilot study utilized 3 cluster 
      subgroupings defined by previous k means cluster analysis on neuropsychiatric, 
      cognitive, and resting EEG variables in order to examine basic sensory auditory 
      chirp task-based EEG parameters from 33 females with the FMR1 premutation (ages 
      17-78). RESULTS: Based on the predefined, neuropsychiatric three-cluster 
      solution, premutation carriers with increased neuropsychiatric features and 
      higher CGG repeat counts (cluster 1) showed decreased stimulus onset response, 
      similar to previous ERP findings across a number of psychiatric disorders but 
      opposite to findings in individuals with full mutation FXS. Premutation carriers 
      with increased executive dysfunction and resting gamma power (cluster 2) 
      exhibited decreased gamma phase locking to a chirp stimulus, similar to 
      individuals with full mutation FXS. Cluster 3 members, who were relatively 
      unaffected by psychiatric or cognitive symptoms, showed the most normative 
      task-based EEG metrics. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest a spectrum of sensory 
      processing characteristics present in subgroups of premutation carriers that have 
      been previously understudied due to lack of overall group differences. Our 
      findings also further validate the pre-defined clinical subgroups by supporting 
      links between disturbances in well-defined neural pathways and behavioral 
      alterations that may be informative for identifying the mechanisms supporting 
      specific risk factors and divergent therapeutic needs in individuals with the 
      FMR1 premutation.

AB  - Instability of simple DNA repeats has been known as a common cause of hereditary 
      ataxias for over 20 years. Routine genetic diagnostics of these phenotypically 
      similar diseases still rely on an iterative workflow for quantification of repeat 
      units by PCR-based methods of limited precision. We established and validated 
      clinical nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing, an amplification-free method for 
      simultaneous analysis of 10 repeat loci associated with clinically overlapping 
      hereditary ataxias. The method combines target enrichment by CRISPR-Cas9, Oxford 
      Nanopore long-read sequencing and a bioinformatics pipeline using the tools 
      STRique and Megalodon for parallel detection of length, sequence, methylation and 
      composition of the repeat loci. Clinical nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing 
      allowed for the precise and parallel analysis of 10 repeat loci associated with 
      adult-onset ataxia and revealed additional parameter such as FMR1 promotor 
      methylation and repeat sequence required for diagnosis at the same time. Using 
      clinical nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing we analysed 100 clinical samples of 
      undiagnosed ataxia patients and identified causative repeat expansions in 28 
      patients. Parallel repeat analysis enabled a molecular diagnosis of ataxias 
      independent of preconceptions on the basis of clinical presentation. Biallelic 
      expansions within RFC1 were identified as the most frequent cause of ataxia. We 
      characterized the RFC1 repeat composition of all patients and identified a novel 
      repeat motif, AGGGG. Our results highlight the power of clinical nanopore 
      Cas9-targeted sequencing as a readily expandable workflow for the in-depth 
      analysis and diagnosis of phenotypically overlapping repeat expansion disorders.

TI  - REViewer: haplotype-resolved visualization of read alignments in and around 
      tandem repeats.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Expansions of short tandem repeats are the cause of many neurogenetic 
      disorders including familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington disease, 
      and many others. Multiple methods have been recently developed that can identify 
      repeat expansions in whole genome or exome sequencing data. Despite the widely 
      recognized need for visual assessment of variant calls in clinical settings, 
      current computational tools lack the ability to produce such visualizations for 
      repeat expansions. Expanded repeats are difficult to visualize because they 
      correspond to large insertions relative to the reference genome and involve many 
      misaligning and ambiguously aligning reads. RESULTS: We implemented REViewer, a 
      computational method for visualization of sequencing data in genomic regions 
      containing long repeat expansions and FlipBook, a companion image viewer designed 
      for manual curation of large collections of REViewer images. To generate a read 
      pileup, REViewer reconstructs local haplotype sequences and distributes reads to 
      these haplotypes in a way that is most consistent with the fragment lengths and 
      evenness of read coverage. To create appropriate training materials for 
      onboarding new users, we performed a concordance study involving 12 scientists 
      involved in short tandem repeat research. We used the results of this study to 
      create a user guide that describes the basic principles of using REViewer as well 
      as a guide to the typical features of read pileups that correspond to low 
      confidence repeat genotype calls. Additionally, we demonstrated that REViewer can 
      be used to annotate clinically relevant repeat interruptions by comparing visual 
      assessment results of 44 FMR1 repeat alleles with the results of triplet repeat 
      primed PCR. For 38 of these alleles, the results of visual assessment were 
      consistent with triplet repeat primed PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Read pileup plots 
      generated by REViewer offer an intuitive way to visualize sequencing data in 
      regions containing long repeat expansions. Laboratories can use REViewer and 
      FlipBook to assess the quality of repeat genotype calls as well as to visually 
      detect interruptions or other imperfections in the repeat sequence and the 
      surrounding flanking regions. REViewer and FlipBook are available under 
      open-source licenses at https://github.com/illumina/REViewer and 
      https://github.com/broadinstitute/flipbook respectively.

AB  - CGG repeat expansions in the FMR1 5'UTR cause the neurodegenerative disease 
      Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). These repeats form stable 
      RNA secondary structures that support aberrant translation in the absence of an 
      AUG start codon (RAN translation), producing aggregate-prone peptides that 
      accumulate within intranuclear neuronal inclusions and contribute to 
      neurotoxicity. Here, we show that the most abundant RAN translation product, 
      FMRpolyG, is markedly less toxic when generated from a construct with a 
      non-repetitive alternating codon sequence in place of the CGG repeat. While 
      exploring the mechanism of this differential toxicity, we observed a +1 
      translational frameshift within the CGG repeat from the arginine to glycine 
      reading frame. Frameshifts occurred within the first few translated repeats and 
      were triggered predominantly by RNA sequence and structural features. Short 
      chimeric R/G peptides form aggregates distinct from those formed by either pure 
      arginine or glycine, and these chimeras induce toxicity in cultured rodent 
      neurons. Together, this work suggests that CGG repeats support translational 
      frameshifting and that chimeric RAN translated peptides may contribute to CGG 
      repeat-associated toxicity in FXTAS and related disorders.

AB  - The fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene contains an expansion-prone CGG 
      repeat within its 5' UTR. Alleles with 55-200 repeats are known as premutation 
      (PM) alleles and confer risk for one or more of the FMR1 premutation (PM) 
      disorders that include Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), 
      Fragile X-associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI), and Fragile 
      X-Associated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (FXAND). PM alleles expand on 
      intergenerational transmission, with the children of PM mothers being at risk of 
      inheriting alleles with > 200 CGG repeats (full mutation FM) alleles) and thus 
      developing Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). PM alleles can be somatically unstable. This 
      can lead to individuals being mosaic for multiple size alleles. Here, we describe 
      a detailed evaluation of somatic mosaicism in a large cohort of female PM 
      carriers and show that 94% display some evidence of somatic instability with the 
      presence of a series of expanded alleles that differ from the next allele by a 
      single repeat unit. Using two different metrics for instability that we have 
      developed, we show that, as with intergenerational instability, there is a direct 
      relationship between the extent of somatic expansion and the number of CGG 
      repeats in the originally inherited allele and an inverse relationship with the 
      number of AGG interruptions. Expansions are progressive as evidenced by a 
      positive correlation with age and by examination of blood samples from the same 
      individual taken at different time points. Our data also suggests the existence 
      of other genetic or environmental factors that affect the extent of somatic 
      expansion. Importantly, the analysis of candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs) suggests that two DNA repair factors, FAN1 and MSH3, may be modifiers of 
      somatic expansion risk in the PM population as observed in other repeat expansion 
      disorders.

AB  - FMR1 premutation cytosine-guanine-guanine repeat expansion alleles are relatively 
      common mutations in the general population that are associated with a 
      neurodegenerative disease (fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome), 
      reproductive health problems and potentially a wide range of additional mental 
      and general health conditions that are not yet well-characterised. The 
      International Fragile X Premutation Registry (IFXPR) was developed to facilitate 
      and encourage research to better understand the FMR1 premutation and its impact 
      on human health, to facilitate clinical trial readiness by identifying and 
      characterising diverse cohorts of individuals interested in study participation, 
      and to build community and collaboration among carriers, family members, 
      researchers and clinicians around the world. Here, we describe the development 
      and content of the IFXPR, characterise its first 747 registrants from 32 
      countries and invite investigators to apply for recruitment support for their 
      project(s). With larger numbers, increased diversity and potentially the future 
      clinical characterisation of registrants, the IFXPR will contribute to a more 
      comprehensive and accurate understanding of the fragile X premutation in human 
      health and support treatment studies.

      Genotype Verification.
PG  - e427
LID - 10.1002/cpz1.427 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome and other fragile X-associated disorders are caused by the 
      full-mutation (>200 copies) and premutation (55 to 200 copies) expansion, 
      respectively, of the CGG short tandem repeat in the fragile X messenger 
      ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene. Clinical diagnostic laboratories use Southern 
      blot analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests to detect and/or 
      size the FMR1 CGG repeats. The development of sensitive and high-throughput 
      triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) assays has diminished the need to subject all samples 
      to Southern blot analysis, which is both labor- and time-intensive. In this 
      article, we describe two direct TP-PCR (dTP-PCR) assays for the detection of FMR1 
      CGG repeat expansions. We outline a protocol that is based on melting curve 
      analysis of dTP-PCR amplicons for a rapid and cost-effective first-tier screening 
      and identification of individuals with premutation and full-mutation expansions. 
      We also describe a protocol that employs capillary electrophoresis to resolve the 
      dTP-PCR amplicon fragments and to estimate the repeat sizes of normal (5 to 44 
      copies), intermediate (45 to 54 copies), and premutation alleles, as well as to 
      detect full mutations and determine the structure of the FMR1 alleles. (c) 2022 The

TI  - Whole genome sequencing for the diagnosis of neurological repeat expansion 
      disorders in the UK: a retrospective diagnostic accuracy and prospective clinical 
      validation study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansion disorders affect about 1 in 3000 individuals and are 
      clinically heterogeneous diseases caused by expansions of short tandem DNA 
      repeats. Genetic testing is often locus-specific, resulting in underdiagnosis of 
      people who have atypical clinical presentations, especially in paediatric 
      patients without a previous positive family history. Whole genome sequencing is 
      increasingly used as a first-line test for other rare genetic disorders, and we 
      aimed to assess its performance in the diagnosis of patients with neurological 
      repeat expansion disorders. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic 
      accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect the most common repeat expansion 
      loci associated with neurological outcomes (AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, 
      C9orf72, CACNA1A, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, and TBP) using samples obtained within 
      the National Health Service in England from patients who were suspected of having 
      neurological disorders; previous PCR test results were used as the reference 
      standard. The clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat 
      expansions was prospectively examined in previously genetically tested and 
      undiagnosed patients recruited in 2013-17 to the 100 000 Genomes Project in the 
      UK, who were suspected of having a genetic neurological disorder (familial or 
      early-onset forms of ataxia, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, dementia, motor 
      neuron disease, parkinsonian movement disorders, intellectual disability, or 
      neuromuscular disorders). If a repeat expansion call was made using whole genome 
      sequencing, PCR was used to confirm the result. FINDINGS: The diagnostic accuracy 
      of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat expansions was evaluated against 793 
      PCR tests previously performed within the NHS from 404 patients. Whole genome 
      sequencing correctly classified 215 of 221 expanded alleles and 1316 of 1321 
      non-expanded alleles, showing 97.3% sensitivity (95% CI 94.2-99.0) and 99.6% 
      specificity (99.1-99.9) across the 13 disease-associated loci when compared with 
      PCR test results. In samples from 11 631 patients in the 100 000 Genomes Project, 
      whole genome sequencing identified 81 repeat expansions, which were also tested 
      by PCR: 68 were confirmed as repeat expansions in the full pathogenic range, 11 
      were non-pathogenic intermediate expansions or premutations, and two were 
      non-expanded repeats (16% false discovery rate). INTERPRETATION: In our study, 
      whole genome sequencing for the detection of repeat expansions showed high 
      sensitivity and specificity, and it led to identification of neurological repeat 
      expansion disorders in previously undiagnosed patients. These findings support 
      implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical laboratories for diagnosis 
      of patients who have a neurological presentation consistent with a repeat 
      expansion disorder. FUNDING: Medical Research Council, Department of Health and

TI  - GIPC1 CGG Repeat Expansion Is Associated with Movement Disorders.
PG  - 704-715
LID - 10.1002/ana.26325 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: CGG/GGC repeat expansion in FMR1 and NOTCH2NLC is reportedly 
      associated with movement disorders; therefore, we hypothesized that the CGG 
      repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1, which was previously identified 
      in myopathy, might also be associated with movement-disorder phenotypes. Here, we 
      investigated whether CGG repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1 
      presents in a cohort of patients with movement disorders. METHODS: We screened 
      for the CGG repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1 in 1,346 
      movement-disorder patients and 1,451 matched healthy controls. RESULTS: No 
      patients or controls harbored expanded CGG repeats in LRP12 or NUTM2B-AS1, 
      whereas 16 patients harbored >40 CGG repeats in GIPC1, with 11 of these patients 
      harboring >60 CGG repeats. One control individual harbored an expanded GIPC1 
      allele (83 CGG units), suggesting that approximately 1% of patients affected by 
      movement disorders in our population might harbor GIPC1 CGG repeat expansion, 
      with this likely extremely rare in healthy controls (<0.001). The clinical 
      phenotypes of the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive patients strongly resembled those in 
      patients displaying NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat-positive movement disorders. 
      Additionally, the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive patients presented white-matter 
      hyperintensities but without typical NOTCH2NLC-related high-intensity signals in 
      the corticomedullary junction. Furthermore, 44% of the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive 
      patients showed a cognitive deficit, and skin biopsies in 2 patients revealed 
      deposition of intranuclear inclusions. INTERPRETATION: The CGG repeat expansion 
      in GIPC1 might be associated with movement-disorder phenotypes and lead to 
      diseases related to intranuclear inclusions. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:704-715.

AB  - Methylated FMR1 full-mutation expansions cause fragile X syndrome. FMR1 
      premutation carriers are susceptible to other late-onset conditions, and women 
      with premutation are at risk of transmitting a fully expanded FMR1 allele to 
      offspring. Identification of individuals with actionable FMR1 genotypes 
      (full-mutation males and females, and premutation females at risk for primary 
      ovarian insufficiency and/or having fragile X-affected offspring) can enable 
      timely access to intervention services and genetic counseling. This study 
      presents a rapid, first-tier test based on melting curve analysis of 
      methylation-specific triplet-primed PCR amplicons (msTP-PCR MCA) for concurrent 
      detection of FMR1 CGG-repeat expansions and their methylation status. The 
      msTP-PCR MCA assay was optimized on 20 fragile X reference samples, and its 
      performance was evaluated on 111 peripheral blood-derived DNA samples from 
      patients who have undergone prior molecular testing with PCR and/or Southern blot 
      analysis. The msTP-PCR MCA assay detected all samples with a methylated FMR1 
      CGG-repeat expansion, and had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive 
      value, and negative predictive values of 100%, 92.06%, 91.1%, and 100%, 
      respectively. The msTP-PCR MCA assay identified premutation/full-mutation 
      mosaicism down to 1%, detected skewed inactivation in females with FMR1 
      expansions, and enabled selective identification of all individuals with an 
      actionable FMR1 genotype. The msTP-PCR MCA assay may aid in fragile X screening 
      of at-risk populations and newborns and voluntary carrier screening of women of 
      reproductive age.

      Causes Behavioral Phenotypes That Vary by Sex and Genotype in Juvenile Mice 
      Expressing Human Mutations That Modulate Neuronal Calcium.

AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are putative environmental risks for 
      neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we tested two hypotheses: (1) developmental 
      exposure to a human-relevant PCB mixture causes behavioral phenotypes relevant to 
      neurodevelopmental disorders; and (2) expression of human mutations that 
      dysregulate neuronal Ca(2+) homeostasis influence sensitivity to behavioral 
      effects of developmental PCB exposures. To test these hypotheses, we used mice 
      that expressed a gain-of-function mutation (T4826I) in ryanodine receptor 1 
      (RYR1), the X-linked fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) CGG repeat expansion 
      or both mutations (double mutant; DM). Transgenic mice and wildtype (WT) mice 
      were exposed to the MARBLES PCB mix at 0, 0.1, 1, and 6 mg/kg/day in the maternal 
      diet throughout gestation and lactation. The MARBLES PCB mix simulates the 
      relative proportions of the 12 most abundant PCB congeners found in the serum of 
      pregnant women at increased risk for having a child with a neurodevelopmental 
      disorder. We assessed ultrasonic vocalizations at postnatal day 7 (P7), 
      spontaneous repetitive behaviors at P25-P30, and sociability at P27-P32. 
      Developmental PCB exposure reduced ultrasonic vocalizations in WT litters in all 
      dose groups, but had no effect on ultrasonic vocalizations in transgenic litters. 
      Developmental PCB exposure significantly increased self-grooming and decreased 
      sociability in WT males in the 0.1 mg/kg dose group, but had no effect on WT 
      females in any dose group. Genotype alone influenced ultrasonic vocalizations, 
      self-grooming and to a lesser extent sociability. Genotype alone also influenced 
      effects of PCBs on sociability. PCB levels in the brain tissue of pups increased 
      in a dose-dependent manner, but within any dose group did not differ between 
      genotypes. In summary, developmental PCB exposure phenocopied social behavior 
      phenotypes observed in mice expressing human mutations that modify intracellular 
      Ca(2+) dynamics, and expression of these mutations alleviated PCB effects on 
      ultrasonic vocalizations and repetitive behavior, and modified the dose-response 
      relationships and sex-dependent effects of PCB effects on social behavior. These 
      findings suggest that: (1) developmental PCB exposure causes behavioral 
      phenotypes that vary by sex and genotype; and (2) sex-specific responses to 
      environmental factors may contribute to sex biases in the prevalence and/or 
      severity of neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex disorder with a heterogeneous 
      etiology. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is recognized as the most common single gene 
      mutation associated with ASD. FXS patients show some autistic behaviors and may 
      be difficult to distinguish at a young age from autistic children. However, there 
      have been no published reports on the prevalence of FXS in ASD patients in 
      Thailand. In this study, we present a pilot study to analyze the CGG repeat sizes 
      of the FMR1 gene in Thai autistic patients. We screened 202 unrelated Thai 
      patients (168 males and 34 females) with nonsyndromic ASD and 212 normal controls 
      using standard FXS molecular diagnosis techniques. The distributions of FMR1 CGG 
      repeat sizes in the ASD and normal control groups were similar, with the two most 
      common alleles having 29 and 30 CGG repeats, followed by an allele with 36 CGG 
      repeats. No FMR1 full mutations or premutations were found in either ASD 
      individuals or the normal controls. Interestingly, three ASD male patients with 
      high normal CGG and intermediate CGG repeats (44, 46, and 53 CGG repeats) were 
      identified, indicating that the prevalence of FMR1 intermediate alleles in Thai 
      ASD patients was approximately 1% while these alleles were absent in the normal 
      male controls. Our study indicates that CGG repeat expansions of the FMR1 gene 
      may not be a common genetic cause of nonsyndromic ASD in Thai patients. However, 
      further studies for mutations other than the CGG expansion in the FMR1 gene are 
      required to get a better information on FXS prevalence in Thai ASD patients.

AB  - While many neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are thought to result from 
      interactions between environmental and genetic risk factors, the identification 
      of specific gene-environment interactions that influence NDD risk remains a 
      critical data gap. We tested the hypothesis that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 
      interact with human mutations that alter the fidelity of neuronal Ca(2+) 
      signaling to confer NDD risk. To test this, we used three transgenic mouse lines 
      that expressed human mutations known to alter Ca(2+) signals in neurons: (1) 
      gain-of-function mutation in ryanodine receptor-1 (T4826I-RYR1); (2) CGG-repeat 
      expansion in the 5' non-coding portion of the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 
      (FMR1); and (3) a double mutant (DM) that expressed both mutations. Transgenic 
      and wildtype (WT) mice were exposed throughout gestation and lactation to the 
      MARBLES PCB mix at 0.1, 1, or 6 mg/kg in the maternal diet. The MARBLES mix 
      simulates the relative proportions of the twelve most abundant PCB congeners 
      found in serum from pregnant women at increased risk for having a child with an 
      NDD. Using Golgi staining, the effect of developmental PCB exposure on dendritic 
      arborization of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 hippocampus and somatosensory cortex 
      of male and female WT mice was compared to pyramidal neurons from transgenic 
      mice. A multilevel linear mixed-effects model identified a main effect of dose 
      driven by increased dendritic arborization of cortical neurons in the 1 mg/kg PCB 
      dose group. Subsequent analyses with genotypes indicated that the MARBLES PCB 
      mixture had no effect on the dendritic arborization of hippocampal neurons in WT 
      mice of either sex, but significantly increased dendritic arborization of 
      cortical neurons of WT males in the 6 mg/kg PCB dose group. Transgene expression 
      increased sensitivity to the impact of developmental PCB exposure on dendritic 
      arborization in a sex-, and brain region-dependent manner. In conclusion, 
      developmental exposure to PCBs present in the gestational environment of at-risk 
      humans interfered with normal dendritic morphogenesis in the developing mouse 
      brain in a sex-, genotype- and brain region-dependent manner. Overall, these 
      observations provide proof-of-principle evidence that PCBs interact with 
      heritable mutations to modulate a neurodevelopmental outcome of relevance to 
      NDDs.

AB  - Fragile X Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative 
      disorder affecting carriers of premutation alleles (PM) of the X-linked FMR1 
      gene, which contain CGG repeat expansions of 55-200 range in a non-coding region. 
      This late-onset disorder is characterised by the presence of tremor/ataxia and 
      cognitive decline, associated with the white matter lesions throughout the brain, 
      especially involving the middle cerebellar peduncles. Nearly half of older male 
      and ~ 20% of female PM carriers develop FXTAS. While there is evidence for 
      mitochondrial dysfunction in neural and some peripheral tissues from FXTAS 
      patients (though less obvious in the non-FXTAS PM carriers), the results from 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are still controversial. Motor, 
      cognitive, and neuropsychiatric impairments were correlated with measures of 
      mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial respiratory activity, AMPK, and TORC1 
      cellular stress-sensing protein kinases, and CGG repeat size, in a sample of 
      adult FXTAS male and female carriers. Moreover, the levels of these cellular 
      measures, all derived from Epstein- Barr virus (EBV)- transformed and easily 
      accessible blood lymphoblasts, were compared between the FXTAS (N = 23) and 
      non-FXTAS (n = 30) subgroups, and with baseline data from 33 healthy 
      non-carriers. A significant hyperactivity of cellular bioenergetics components as 
      compared with the baseline data, more marked in the non-FXTAS PMs, was negatively 
      correlated with repeat numbers at the lower end of the CGG-PM distribution. 
      Significant associations of these components with motor impairment measures, 
      including tremor-ataxia and parkinsonism, and neuropsychiatric changes, were 
      prevalent in the FXTAS subgroup. Moreover, a striking elevation of AMPK activity, 
      and a decrease in TORC1 levels, especially in the non-FXTAS carriers, were 
      related to the size of CGG expansion. The bioenergetics changes in blood 
      lymphoblasts are biomarkers of the clinical status of FMR1 carriers. The 
      relationship between these changes and neurological involvement in the affected 
      carriers suggests that brain bioenergetic alterations are reflected in this 
      peripheral tissue. A possible neuroprotective role of stress sensing kinase, 
      AMPK, in PM carriers, should be addressed in future longitudinal studies. A 
      decreased level of TORC1-the mechanistic target of the rapamycin complex, 
      suggests a possible future approach to therapy in FXTAS.

LID - 1669
AB  - FMR1 (FMRP translational regulator 1) variants other than repeat expansion are 
      known to cause disease phenotypes but can be overlooked if they are not accounted 
      for in genetic testing strategies. We collected and reanalyzed the evidence for 
      pathogenicity of FMR1 coding, noncoding, and copy number variants published to 
      date. There is a spectrum of disease-causing FMR1 variation, with clinical and 
      functional evidence supporting pathogenicity of five splicing, five missense, one 
      in-frame deletion, one nonsense, and four frameshift variants. In addition, FMR1 
      deletions occur in both mosaic full mutation patients and as constitutional 
      pathogenic alleles. De novo deletions arise not only from full mutation alleles 
      but also alleles with normal-sized CGG repeats in several patients, suggesting 
      that the CGG repeat region may be prone to genomic instability even in the 
      absence of repeat expansion. We conclude that clinical tests for potentially 
      FMR1-related indications such as intellectual disability should include methods 
      capable of detecting small coding, noncoding, and copy number variants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by CGG-repeat expansion in FMR1 
      promoter, is one of the most common causes of mental retardation. Individuals 
      with full mutation and premutation alleles have a high risk of 
      psychophysiological disorder and of having affected offspring. Frequencies of 
      FMR1 alleles in general newborns have been reported in Caucasians but have not 
      been investigated in the large-scale population in  the mainland of China. 
      METHODS: The sizes of FMR1 CGG-repeats were analyzed in 51,661 newborns (28,114 
      males and 23,547 females) and also in a cohort of 33 children diagnosed with 
      developmental delay using GC-rich polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and triple 
      repeat primed PCR. RESULTS: The frequency of CGG repeats > 100 was 1/9371 in 
      males and 1/5887 in females, and the frequency of CGG repeats > 54 was 1/1561 in 
      males and 1/1624 in females. FMR1 full mutation and premutation were identified 
      in 27.27% of children who had Ages and Stages Questionnaire scores less than two 
      standard deviations from the cutoff value. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed the 
      prevalence of FXS in China and improved the sample databases of FXS, suggesting 
      that the prevalence of FXS in Chinese is higher than estimated previously and 
      that FXS screening can be advised to high-risk families.

AB  - Background: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common single-gene cause of 
      intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is caused by a 
      >200-trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region of the fragile 
      X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Individuals with FXS can present with a range 
      of neurobehavioral impairments including, but not limited to: cognitive, 
      language, and adaptive deficits; ASD; anxiety; social withdrawal and avoidance; 
      and aggression. Decreased expression of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) 
      receptor delta subunit and deficient GABAergic tonic inhibition could be associated 
      with symptoms of FXS. Gaboxadol (OV101) is a delta-subunit-selective, extrasynaptic 
      GABA(A) receptor agonist that enhances GABAergic tonic inhibition, providing the 
      rationale for assessment of OV101 as a potential targeted treatment of FXS. No 
      drug is approved in the United States for the treatment of FXS. Methods: This 
      12-weeks, randomized (1:1:1), double-blind, parallel-group, phase 2a study was 
      designed to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and optimal daily dose of 
      OV101 5 mg [once (QD), twice (BID), or three-times daily (TID)] when administered 
      for 12 weeks to adolescent and adult men with FXS. Safety was the primary study 
      objective, with key assessments including treatment-emergent adverse events 
      (TEAEs), treatment-related adverse events leading to study discontinuation, and 
      serious adverse events (SAEs). The secondary study objective was to evaluate the 
      effect of OV101 on a variety of problem behaviors. Results: A total of 23 
      participants with FXS (13 adolescents, 10 adults) with moderate-to-severe 
      neurobehavioral phenotypes (Full Scale Intelligence Quotient, 41.5 +/- 3.29; ASD, 
      82.6%) were randomized to OV101 5 mg QD (n = 8), 5 mg BID (n = 8), or 5 mg TID (n 
      = 7) for 12 weeks. OV101 was well tolerated across all 3 treatment regimens. The 
      most common TEAEs were upper respiratory tract infection (n = 4), headache (n = 
      3), diarrhea (n = 2), and irritability (n = 2). No SAEs were reported. 
      Improvements from baseline to end-of-treatment were observed on several efficacy 
      endpoints, and 60% of participants were identified as treatment responders based 
      on Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement. Conclusions: Overall, OV101 was safe 
      and well tolerated. Efficacy results demonstrate an initial signal for OV101 in 
      individuals with FXS. These results need to be confirmed in a larger, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled study with optimal outcomes and in the most appropriate age 
      group. Clinical Trial Registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier:

TI  - FMRP Levels in Human Peripheral Blood Leukocytes Correlates with Intellectual 
      Disability.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics11101780 [doi]
LID - 1780
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual 
      disability. FXS is an X-linked, neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a CGG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the Fragile 
      X Mental Retardation gene, FMR1. Greater than 200 CGG repeats results in 
      epigenetic silencing of the gene leading to the deficiency or absence of Fragile 
      X mental retardation protein (FMRP). The loss of FMRP is considered the root 
      cause of FXS. The relationship between neurological function and FMRP expression 
      in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has not been well established. 
      Assays to detect and measure FMR1 and FMRP have been described; however, none are 
      sufficiently sensitive, precise, or quantitative to properly characterize the 
      relationships between cognitive ability and CGG repeat number, FMR1 mRNA 
      expression, or FMRP expression measured in PBMCs. To address these limitations, 
      two novel immunoassays were developed and optimized, an electro-chemiluminescence 
      immunoassay and a multiparameter flow cytometry assay. Both assays were performed 
      on PMBCs isolated from 27 study participants with FMR1 CGG repeats ranging from 
      normal to full mutation. After correcting for methylation, a significant positive 
      correlation between CGG repeat number and FMR1 mRNA expression levels and a 
      significant negative correlation between FMRP levels and CGG repeat expansion was 
      observed. Importantly, a high positive correlation was observed between 
      intellectual quotient (IQ) and FMRP expression measured in PBMCs.

AB  - Traditional methods for the analysis of repeat expansions, which underlie genetic 
      disorders, such as fragile X syndrome (FXS), lack single-nucleotide resolution in 
      repeat analysis and the ability to characterize causative variants outside the 
      repeat array. These drawbacks can be overcome by long-read and short-read 
      sequencing, respectively. However, the routine application of next-generation 
      sequencing in the clinic requires target enrichment, and none of the available 
      methods allows parallel analysis of long-DNA fragments using both sequencing 
      technologies. In this study, we investigated the use of indirect sequence capture 
      (Xdrop technology) coupled to Nanopore and Illumina sequencing to characterize 
      FMR1, the gene responsible of FXS. We achieved the efficient enrichment (> 200x) 
      of large target DNA fragments (~60-80 kbp) encompassing the entire FMR1 gene. The 
      analysis of Xdrop-enriched samples by Nanopore long-read sequencing allowed the 
      complete characterization of repeat lengths in samples with normal, pre-mutation, 
      and full mutation status (> 1 kbp), and correctly identified repeat interruptions 
      relevant for disease prognosis and transmission. Single-nucleotide variants 
      (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (indels) could be detected in the same 
      samples by Illumina short-read sequencing, completing the mutational testing 
      through the identification of pathogenic variants within the FMR1 gene, when no 
      typical CGG repeat expansion is detected. The study successfully demonstrated the 
      parallel analysis of repeat expansions and SNVs/indels in the FMR1 gene at 
      single-nucleotide resolution by combining Xdrop enrichment with two 
      next-generation sequencing approaches. With the appropriate optimization 
      necessary for the clinical settings, the system could facilitate both the study 
      of genotype-phenotype correlation in FXS and enable a more efficient diagnosis 
      and genetic counseling for patients and their relatives.

TI  - FXTAS is difficult to differentiate from neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease 
      through skin biopsy: a case report.
PG  - 396
LID - 10.1186/s12883-021-02425-z [doi]
LID - 396
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and 
      late-onset neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) show CGG/GGC 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions. Differentiating these diseases are difficult 
      because of the similarity in their clinical and radiological features. It is 
      unclear that skin biopsy can distinguish NIID from FXTAS. We performed a skin 
      biopsy in an FXTAS case with cognitive dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy 
      without tremor, which was initially suspected to be NIID. CASE PRESENTATION: The 
      patient underwent neurological assessment and examinations, including laboratory 
      tests, electrophysiologic test, imaging, skin biopsy, and genetic test. A brain 
      MRI showed hyperintensity lesions along the corticomedullary junction on 
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in addition to middle cerebellar peduncle sign 
      (MCP sign). We suspected NIID from the clinical picture and the radiological 
      findings, and performed a skin biopsy. The skin biopsy specimen showed ubiquitin- 
      and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions, suggesting NIID. However, a genetic 
      analysis for NIID using repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR) revealed 
      no expansion detected in the Notch 2 N-terminal like C (NOTCH2NLC) gene. We then 
      performed genetic analysis for FXTAS using RP-PCR, which revealed a repeat 
      CGG/GGC expansion in the FMRP translational regulator 1 (FMR1) gene. The number 
      of repeats was 83. We finally diagnosed the patient with FXTAS rather than NIID. 
      CONCLUSIONS: For the differential diagnosis of FXTAS and NIID, a skin biopsy 
      alone is insufficient; instead, genetic analysis, is essential. Further 
      investigations in additional cases based on genetic analysis are needed to 
      elucidate the clinical and pathological differences between FXTAS and NIID.

TI  - Utilization of Whole Exome Sequencing in Non-Syndromic Premature Ovarian Failure: 
      Ficolin-3 Gene Mutation in an Iranian Family.
PG  - 441-6
LID - 10.52547/ibj.25.6.441 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Premature ovarian failure is a heterogeneous disorder, leading to 
      early menopause. Several genes have been identified as the cause of non-syndromic 
      premature ovarian failure (POF). Our aim was to explore the genetic defects in 
      Iranian patients with POF. METHODS: We studied a family with three females 
      exhibiting non-syndromic POF. WES was performed for one of the affected 
      individuals after ruling out the presence of CGG repeat expansion at fragile X 
      mental retardation 1 gene in the family. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm 
      the candidate sequence variants in the proband, and screening of the detected 
      mutation was performed for the other affected and unaffected members of the 
      family. RESULTS: A homozygous frameshift mutation, c.349delC, was identified in 
      ficolin-3 (FCN3) gene in the proband and two other patients. The parents and two 
      healthy brothers were heterozygous for the mutation, and an unaffected sister was 
      homozygous for wild type. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of a mutation in 
      FCN3 gene in a family with POF. Our findings can lead to the enhancement of 
      genetic databases of patients with POF, specifically for families with high-risk 
      background.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to identify mutations in the FMR1 gene in a group of 
      Brazilian women diagnosed with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). METHODS: This 
      cross-sectional study included patients aged under 40 years with confirmed POI 
      from a convenience sample of patients seen from June 2017 to December 2018 at a 
      University Hospital in Curitiba, Brazil. Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed 
      using FragilEase(tm) PCR kits (PerkinElmer), a commercially available test that 
      enables the quantification of CGG trinucleotide repeat expansions in the FMR1 
      gene. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients with an average age of 35.8+/-3.97 years were 
      included. Fifty (96.1%) had normal alleles with 18 to 43 CGG repeats. The most 
      frequent CGG-repeat sizes were 28 and 30. Two patients (3.8%) presented mutations 
      in the FMR1 gene. The first had alleles with 19/97 CGG repeats, was categorized 
      as a premutation carrier for FXS, and had a son with cognitive impairment. The 
      second had alleles with 21/45 CGG repeats and was described as belonging to the 
      gray zone. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, 3.8% of the females with POI had mutations 
      in the FMR1 gene. The most frequent allele sizes were 28 and 30 CGG repeats.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening for short tandem repeat (STR) expansions in next-generation 
      sequencing data can enable diagnosis, optimal clinical management/treatment, and 
      accurate genetic counseling of patients with repeat expansion disorders. We aimed 
      to develop an efficient computational workflow for reliable detection of STR 
      expansions in next-generation sequencing data and demonstrate its clinical 
      utility. METHODS: We characterized the performance of eight STR analysis methods 
      (lobSTR, HipSTR, RepeatSeq, ExpansionHunter, TREDPARSE, GangSTR, STRetch, and 
      exSTRa) on next-generation sequencing datasets of samples with known 
      disease-causing full-mutation STR expansions and genomes simulated to harbor 
      repeat expansions at selected loci and optimized their sensitivity. We then used 
      a machine learning decision tree classifier to identify an optimal combination of 
      methods for full-mutation detection. In Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)-aligned 
      genomes, the ensemble approach of using ExpansionHunter, STRetch, and exSTRa 
      performed the best (precision = 82%, recall = 100%, F1-score = 90%). We applied 
      this pipeline to screen 301 families of children with suspected genetic 
      disorders. RESULTS: We identified 10 individuals with full-mutations in the AR, 
      ATXN1, ATXN8, DMPK, FXN, or HTT disease STR locus in the analyzed families. 
      Additional candidates identified in our analysis include two probands with 
      borderline ATXN2 expansions between the established repeat size range for 
      reduced-penetrance and full-penetrance full-mutation and seven individuals with 
      FMR1 CGG repeats in the intermediate/premutation repeat size range. In 67 
      probands with a prior negative clinical PCR test for the FMR1, FXN, or DMPK 
      disease STR locus, or the spinocerebellar ataxia disease STR panel, our pipeline 
      did not falsely identify aberrant expansion. We performed clinical PCR tests on 
      seven (out of 10) full-mutation samples identified by our pipeline and confirmed 
      the expansion status in all, showing absolute concordance between our 
      bioinformatics and molecular findings. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully 
      demonstrated the application of a well-optimized bioinformatics pipeline that 
      promotes the utility of genome-wide sequencing as a first-tier screening test to 
      detect expansions of known disease STRs. Interrogating clinical next-generation 
      sequencing data for pathogenic STR expansions using our ensemble pipeline can 
      improve diagnostic yield and enhance clinical outcomes for patients with repeat 
      expansion disorders.

LID - 10.1136/jmedgenet-2021-107758 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset condition 
      characterised by cerebellar ataxia and intention tremor, usually found in 
      individuals with FMR1 premutation alleles (PM-CGG expansion of 55-199 repeats). 
      Population studies estimate that between 1 in 250 and 1 in 1600 men have a PM, 
      with up to 45% of these men suggested to develop FXTAS by age 80. We used a 
      Bayesian approach to compare the probability of finding a specific PM genotype in 
      an ataxia population to a population control group and found an estimated 
      penetrance of <1% (0.031%; CI 0.007% to 0.141%) for men with </=70 CGGs. These 
      findings suggest that men with a PM of </=70 CGGs, who comprise the vast majority 
      of those with a PM, have a much lower risk of being affected with FXTAS than 
      previously suggested. This is an issue of growing importance for accurate genetic 
      counselling, as those with a PM of </=70 CGGs are increasingly detected through 
      community carrier screening or neurodevelopmental assessment programmes.

TI  - The influence of sex, genotype, and dose on serum and hippocampal cytokine levels 
      in juvenile mice developmentally exposed to a human-relevant mixture of 
      polychlorinated biphenyls.
PG  - 85-103
LID - 10.1016/j.crtox.2020.09.001 [doi]
AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are pervasive environmental contaminants 
      implicated as risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Immune 
      dysregulation is another NDD risk factor, and developmental PCB exposures are 
      associated with early life immune dysregulation. Studies of the immunomodulatory 
      effects of PCBs have focused on the higher-chlorinated congeners found in legacy 
      commercial mixtures. Comparatively little is known about the immune effects of 
      contemporary, lower-chlorinated PCBs. This is a critical data gap given recent 
      reports that lower-chlorinated congeners comprise >70% of the total PCB burden in 
      serum of pregnant women enrolled in the MARBLES study who are at increased risk 
      for having a child with an NDD. To examine the influence of PCBs, sex, and 
      genotype on cytokine levels, mice were exposed throughout gestation and lactation 
      to a PCB mixture in the maternal diet, which was based on the 12 most abundant 
      PCBs in sera from MARBLES subjects. Using multiplex array, cytokines were 
      quantified in the serum and hippocampus of weanling mice expressing either a 
      human gain-of-function mutation in ryanodine receptor 1 (T4826I mice), a human 
      CGG premutation repeat expansion in the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 (CGG 
      mice), or both mutations (DM mice). Congenic wildtype (WT) mice were used as 
      controls. There were dose-dependent effects of PCB exposure on cytokine 
      concentrations in the serum but not hippocampus. Differential effects of genotype 
      were observed in the serum and hippocampus. Hippocampal cytokines were 
      consistently elevated in T4826I mice and also in WT animals for some cytokines 
      compared to CGG and DM mice, while serum cytokines were usually elevated in the 
      mutant genotypes compared to the WT group. Males had elevated levels of 19 
      cytokines in the serum and 4 in the hippocampus compared to females, but there 
      were also interactions between sex and genotype for 7 hippocampal cytokines. Only 
      the chemokine CCL5 in the serum showed an interaction between PCB dose, genotype, 
      and sex. Collectively, these findings indicate differential influences of PCB 
      exposure and genotype on cytokine levels in serum and hippocampal tissue of 
      weanling mice. These results suggest that developmental PCB exposure has chronic 
      effects on baseline serum, but not hippocampal, cytokine levels in juvenile mice.

TI  - Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) phenotype in fragile X premutation 
      carriers: case series.
PG  - 687-690
LID - 10.1136/jmedgenet-2020-107609 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While an association between full mutation CGG-repeat expansions of 
      the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene and connective tissue problems are 
      clearly described, problems in fragile X premutation carriers (fXPCs) CGG-repeat 
      range (55-200 repeats) of the FMR1 gene may be overlooked. OBJECTIVE: To report 
      five FMR1 fXPCs cases with the hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) 
      phenotype. METHODS: We collected medical histories and FMR1 molecular measures 
      from five cases who presented with joint hypermobility and loose connective 
      tissue and met inclusion criteria for hEDS. RESULTS: Five cases were female and 
      ranged between 16 and 49 years. The range of CGG-repeat allele sizes ranged from 
      66 to 150 repeats. All had symptoms of hEDS since early childhood. Commonalities 
      in molecular pathogenesis and coexisting conditions between the fXPCs and hEDS 
      are also presented. The premutation can lead to a reduction of fragile X mental 
      retardation protein, which is crucial in maintaining functions of the 
      extracellular matrix-related proteins, particularly matrix metallopeptidase 9 and 
      elastin. Moreover, elevated FMR1 messenger RNA causes sequestration of proteins, 
      which results in RNA toxicity. CONCLUSION: Both hEDS phenotype and premutation 
      involvement may co-occur because of related commonalities in pathogenesis.

AB  - CGG expansions between 55 and 200 in the 5'-untranslated region of the fragile-X 
      mental retardation gene (FMR1) increase the risk of developing the late-onset 
      debilitating neuromuscular disease Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome 
      (FXTAS). While the science behind this mutation, as a paradigm for RNA-mediated 
      nucleotide triplet repeat expansion diseases, has progressed rapidly, no 
      treatment has proven effective at delaying the onset or decreasing morbidity, 
      especially at later stages of the disease. Here, we demonstrated the beneficial 
      effect of the phytochemical sulforaphane (SFN), exerted through NRF2-dependent 
      and independent manner, on pathways relevant to brain function, bioenergetics, 
      unfolded protein response, proteosome, antioxidant defenses, and iron metabolism 
      in fibroblasts from FXTAS-affected subjects at all disease stages. This study 
      paves the way for future clinical studies with SFN in the treatment of FXTAS, 
      substantiated by the established use of this agent in clinical trials of diseases 
      with NRF2 dysregulation and in which age is the leading risk factor.

      Community-Based Cohort.
PG  - 2378-2386
LID - 10.1002/mds.28683 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Premutation-sized (55-200) CGG repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene 
      cause fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Most studies of 
      premutation carriers utilized reverse ascertainment to identify patients, leading 
      to a selection bias for larger repeats. As shorter CGG premutation repeats are 
      common in the population, understanding their impact on health outcomes has a 
      potentially large public health footprint. OBJECTIVE: The study's objective was 
      to compare an unselected group of premutation carriers (n = 35, 55-101 CGG 
      repeats) with matched controls (n = 61, 29-39 CGG repeats) with respect to 
      FXTAS-type signs using structured neurological assessments. METHODS: Three 
      neurologists independently rated signs, using an adapted version of the FXTAS 
      Rating Scale (Leehey MA, Berry-Kravis E, Goetz CG, et al. FMR1 CGG repeat length 
      predicts motor dysfunction in premutation carriers. Neurology. 2008). This was a 
      double-blind study, as genetic status (premutation vs. control) was known neither 
      by the participants nor by any of the neurologists. Analyses controlled 
      potentially confounding comorbid conditions in the electronic health record (eg, 
      osteoarthritis and stroke) and probed the association of age with signs. RESULTS: 
      Although there was no overall difference between carriers and controls, among 
      individuals without any potentially confounding comorbid diagnoses, there was a 
      statistically significant age-associated elevation in FXTAS-type signs in 
      premutation carriers compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Among those who do not 
      have other comorbid diagnoses, women who have CGG repeats at the lower end of the 
      premutation range may be at greater risk for ataxia and parkinsonism than their 
      age peers, although their overall risk of developing such clinical features is 
      low. This study should provide reassurance to those who share characteristics 
      with the present cohort. (c) 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder

AB  - Moderate to hyper-expansion of trinucleotide repeats at the FRAXA and FRAXE 
      fragile sites, with or without concurrent hypermethylation, has been associated 
      with intellectual disability and other conditions. Unlike molecular diagnosis of 
      FMR1 CGG repeat expansions in FRAXA, current detection of AFF2 CCG repeat 
      expansions in FRAXE relies on low-throughput and otherwise inefficient techniques 
      combining Southern blot analysis and PCR. A novel triplet-primed PCR assay was 
      developed for simultaneous screening for trinucleotide repeat expansions at the 
      FRAXA and FRAXE fragile sites, and was validated using archived clinical samples 
      of known FMR1 and AFF2 genotypes. Population samples and FRAXE-affected samples 
      were sequenced for the evaluation of variations in the AFF2 CCG repeat structure. 
      The duplex assay accurately identified expansions at the FMR1 and AFF2 
      trinucleotide repeat loci. On Sanger sequencing of the AFF2 CCG repeat, the 
      single-nucleotide polymorphism variant rs868914124(C) that effectively adds two 
      CCG repeats at the 5'-end, was enriched in the Malay population and with short 
      repeats (<11 CCGs), and was present in all six expanded AFF2 alleles of this 
      study. All expanded AFF2 alleles contained multiple non-CCG interruptions toward 
      the 5'-end of the repeat. A sensitive, robust, and rapid assay has been developed 
      for the simultaneous detection of expansion mutations at the FMR1 and AFF2 
      trinucleotide repeat loci, simplifying screening for FRAXA- and FRAXE-associated 
      disorders.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor and ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset, 
      progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by tremors, ataxia and 
      neuropsychological problems. This disease is quite common in the general 
      population with approximately 20 million carriers worldwide. The risk of 
      developing FXTAS increases dramatically with age, with about 45% of male carriers 
      over the age of 50 being affected. FXTAS is caused by a CGG-repeat expansion 
      (CGGexp) in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. CGGexp RNA is 
      translated into the FMRpolyG protein by a mechanism called RAN translation. 
      Although both gene and pathogenic trigger are known, no therapeutic interventions 
      are available at this moment. Here, we present, for the first time, primary 
      hippocampal neurons derived from the ubiquitous inducible mouse model which is 
      used as a screening tool for targeted interventions. A promising candidate is the 
      repeat binding, RAN translation blocking, small molecule 1a. Small molecule 1a 
      shields the disease-causing CGGexp from being translated into the toxic FMRpolyG 
      protein. Primary hippocampal neurons formed FMRpolyG-positive inclusions, and 
      upon treatment with 1a, the numbers of FMRpolyG-positive inclusions are reduced. 
      We also describe for the first time the formation of FMRpolyG-positive inclusions 
      in the liver of this mouse model. Treatment with 1a reduced the insoluble 
      FMRpolyG protein fraction in the liver but not the number of inclusions. 
      Moreover, 1a treatment had a reducing effect on the number of Rad23b-positive 
      inclusions and insoluble Rad23b protein levels. These data suggest that targeted 
      small molecule therapy is effective in an FXTAS mouse model and has the potential 
      to treat CGGexp-mediated diseases, including FXTAS.

AB  - Non-coding repeat expansions, such as CGG, GGC, CUG, CCUG, and GGGGCC, have been 
      shown to be involved in many human diseases, particularly neurological disorders. 
      Of the diverse pathogenic mechanisms proposed in these neurodegenerative 
      diseases, dysregulated RNA metabolism has emerged as an important contributor. 
      Expanded repeat RNAs that form particular structures aggregate to form RNA foci, 
      sequestering various RNA binding proteins and consequently altering RNA splicing, 
      transport, and other downstream biological processes. One of these repeat 
      expansion-associated diseases, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS), is caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the 5'UTR region of the fragile X 
      mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Moreover, recent studies have revealed abnormal 
      GGC repeat expansion within the 5'UTR region of the NOTCH2NLC gene in both 
      essential tremor (ET) and neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). These 
      CGG repeat expansion-associated diseases share genetic, pathological, and 
      clinical features. Identification of the similarities at the molecular level 
      could lead to a better understanding of the disease mechanisms as well as 
      developing novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we highlight our current 
      understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of CGG repeat expansion-associated 
      diseases and discuss potential therapeutic interventions for these neurological 
      disorders.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) has a classic phenotype, however its expression can be 
      variable among full mutation males. This is secondary to variable methylation 
      mosaicisms and the number of CGG triplet repeats in the non-coding region of the 
      Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, producing a variable expression of 
      the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Here we report a family with 
      several individuals affected by FXS: a boy with a hypermethylated FMR1 mutation 
      and a classic phenotype; a man with an FMR1 gene mosaicism in the range of 
      premutation (PM) and full mutation (FM), who has a mild phenotype due to which 
      FXS was initially disregarded; and the cases of four women with a FM and 
      mosaicism. This report highlights the importance of DNA molecular testing for the 
      diagnosis of FXS in patients with developmental delay, intellectual disability 
      and/or autism due to the variable phenotype that occurs in individuals with FMR1 
      mosaicisms.

AB  - CGG tandem repeat expansion in the 5'-untranslated region of the fragile X mental 
      retardation-1 (FMR1) gene leads to unusual nucleic acid conformations, hence 
      causing genetic instabilities. We show that the number of G...G (in CGG repeat) or 
      C...C (in CCG repeat) mismatches (other than A...T, T...A, C...G and G...C canonical base 
      pairs) dictates the secondary structural choice of the sense and antisense 
      strands of the FMR1 gene and their corresponding transcripts in fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). The circular dichroism (CD) spectra 
      and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) reveal that CGG DNA (sense strand 
      of the FMR1 gene) and its transcript favor a quadruplex structure. CD, EMSA and 
      molecular dynamics (MD) simulations also show that more than four C...C mismatches 
      cannot be accommodated in the RNA duplex consisting of the CCG repeat (antisense 
      transcript); instead, it favors an i-motif conformational intermediate. Such a 
      preference for unusual secondary structures provides a convincing justification 
      for the RNA foci formation due to the sequestration of RNA-binding proteins to 
      the bidirectional transcripts and the repeat-associated non-AUG translation that 
      are observed in FXTAS. The results presented here also suggest that small 
      molecule modulators that can destabilize FMR1 CGG DNA and RNA quadruplex 
      structures could be promising candidates for treating FXTAS.

      neuropsychiatric disorders. These CGG repeats are translated into a toxic 
      polyglycine-containing protein, FMRpolyG. Pathology of Fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome and Fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders 
      comprises FMRpolyG- and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions. Diagnosing a 
      FMR1-premutation carrier remains challenging, as the clinical features overlap 
      with other neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we describe two male cases with 
      Fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders-related symptoms and mild 
      movement disturbances and novel pathological features that can attribute to the 
      variable phenotype. Macroscopically, both donors did not show characteristic 
      white matter lesions on MRI; however, vascular infarcts in cortical- and 
      sub-cortical regions were identified. Immunohistochemistry analyses revealed a 
      high number of FMRpolyG intranuclear inclusions throughout the brain, which were 
      also positive for p62. Importantly, we identified a novel pathological vascular 
      phenotype with inclusions present in pericytes and endothelial cells. Although 
      these results need to be confirmed in more cases, we propose that these vascular 
      lesions in the brain could contribute to the complex symptomology of 
      FMR1-premutation carriers. Overall, our report suggests that Fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome and Fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders may 
      present diverse clinical involvements resembling other types of dementia, and in 
      the absence of genetic testing, FMRpolyG can be used post-mortem to identify 
      premutation carriers.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent form of inherited intellectual 
      disability and the best-described monogenic cause of autism. CGG-repeat expansion 
      in the FMR1 gene leads to FMR1 silencing, loss-of-expression of the Fragile X 
      Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), and is a common cause of FXS. Missense 
      mutations in the FMR1 gene were also identified in FXS patients, including the 
      recurrent FMRP-R138Q mutation. To investigate the mechanisms underlying FXS 
      caused by this mutation, we generated a knock-in mouse model (Fmr1(R138Q)) 
      expressing the FMRP-R138Q protein. We demonstrate that, in the hippocampus of the 
      Fmr1(R138Q) mice, neurons show an increased spine density associated with 
      synaptic ultrastructural defects and increased AMPA receptor-surface expression. 
      Combining biochemical assays, high-resolution imaging, electrophysiological 
      recordings, and behavioural testing, we also show that the R138Q mutation results 
      in impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation and socio-cognitive deficits in 
      mice. These findings reveal the functional impact of the FMRP-R138Q mutation in a 
      mouse model of FXS.

TI  - Clinical Characteristics of Fragile X Syndrome Patients in Japan.
PG  - 30-33
LID - 10.33160/yam.2021.02.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a well-known X-linked disorder clinically 
      characterized by intellectual disability and autistic features. However, 
      diagnosed Japanese FXS cases have been fewer than expected, and clinical features 
      of Japanese FXS patients remain unknown. METHODS: We evaluated the clinical 
      features of Japanese FXS patients using the results of a questionnaire-based 
      survey. RESULTS: We presented the characteristics of seven patients aged 6 to 20 
      years. Long face and large ears were observed in five of seven patients. 
      Macrocephaly was observed in four of five patients. The meaningful word was first 
      seen at a certain time point between 18 and 72 months (median = 60 months). 
      Developmental quotient or intellectual quotient ranged between 20 and 48 (median 
      = 29). Behavioral disorders were seen in all patients (autistic spectrum disorder 
      in six patients, hyperactivity in five patients). Five patients were diagnosed by 
      polymerase chain reaction analysis, and two patients were diagnosed by the 
      cytogenetic study. All physicians ordered FXS genetic testing for suspicious 
      cases because of clinical manifestations. CONCLUSION: In the present study, a 
      long face, large ears, macrocephaly, autistic spectrum disorder, and 
      hyperactivity were observed in almost cases, and these characteristics might be 
      common features in Japanese FXS patients. Our finding indicated the importance of 
      clinical manifestations to diagnosis FXS. However, the sample size of the present 
      study is small, and these features are also seen to patients with other 
      disorders. We consider that genetic testing for FXS should be performed on a 
      wider range of intellectually disabled cases.

LID - 600840
AB  - Background: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is an adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder associated with premutation CGG-repeat expansions 
      (55-200 repeats) in the 5' non-coding portion of the fragile X mental retardation 
      1 (FMR1) gene. Core features of FXTAS include progressive tremor/ataxia, 
      cognitive decline, variable brain volume loss, and white matter disease. The 
      principal histopathological feature of FXTAS is the presence of central nervous 
      system (CNS) and non-CNS intranuclear inclusions. Objective: To further elucidate 
      the molecular underpinnings of FXTAS through the proteomic characterization of 
      human FXTAS cortexes. Results: Proteomic analysis of FXTAS brain cortical tissue 
      (n = 8) identified minor differences in protein abundance compared to control 
      brains (n = 6). Significant differences in FXTAS relative to control brain 
      predominantly involved decreased abundance of proteins, with the greatest 
      decreases observed for tenascin-C (TNC), cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38), 
      and phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1); proteins typically increased in 
      other neurodegenerative diseases. Proteins with the greatest increased abundance 
      include potentially novel neurodegeneration-related proteins and small 
      ubiquitin-like modifier 1/2 (SUMO1/2). The FMRpolyG peptide, proposed in models 
      of FXTAS pathogenesis but only identified in trace amounts in the earlier study 
      of FXTAS inclusions, was not identified in any of the FXTAS or control brains in 
      the current study. Discussion: The observed proteomic shifts, while generally 
      relatively modest, do show a bias toward decreased protein abundance with FXTAS. 
      Such shifts in protein abundance also suggest altered RNA binding as well as loss 
      of cell-cell adhesion/structural integrity. Unlike other neurodegenerative 
      diseases, the proteome of end-stage FXTAS does not suggest a strong 
      inflammation-mediated degenerative response.

TI  - CGG repeat RNA G-quadruplexes interact with FMRpolyG to cause neuronal 
      dysfunction in fragile X-related tremor/ataxia syndrome.

AB  - Fragile X-related tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by CGG triplet repeat expansions in FMR1, which elicit repeat-associated 
      non-AUG (RAN) translation and produce the toxic protein FMRpolyG. We show that 
      FMRpolyG interacts with pathogenic CGG repeat-derived RNA G-quadruplexes 
      (CGG-G4RNA), propagates cell to cell, and induces neuronal dysfunction. The 
      FMRpolyG polyglycine domain has a prion-like property, preferentially binding to 
      CGG-G4RNA. Treatment with 5-aminolevulinic acid, which is metabolized to 
      protoporphyrin IX, inhibited RAN translation of FMRpolyG and CGG-G4RNA-induced 
      FMRpolyG aggregation, ameliorating aberrant synaptic plasticity and behavior in 
      FXTAS model mice. Thus, we present a novel therapeutic strategy to target G4RNA 
      prionoids.

TI  - Lack of a Clear Behavioral Phenotype in an Inducible FXTAS Mouse Model Despite

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a rare neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a 55-200 CGG repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region of 
      the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. FXTAS is characterized by 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia, Parkinsonism, intention tremors and cognitive 
      decline. The main neuropathological hallmark of FXTAS is the presence of 
      ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions in neurons and astrocytes throughout 
      the brain. The molecular pathology of FXTAS involves the presence of 2 to 8-fold 
      elevated levels of FMR1 mRNA, and of a repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translated 
      polyglycine peptide (FMRpolyG). Increased levels of FMR1 mRNA containing an 
      expanded CGG repeat can result in cellular toxicity by an RNA gain-of-function 
      mechanism. The increased levels of CGG repeat-expanded FMR1 transcripts may 
      create RNA foci that sequester important cellular proteins, including RNA-binding 
      proteins and FMRpolyG, in intranuclear inclusions. To date, it is unclear whether 
      the FMRpolyG-positive intranuclear inclusions are a cause or a consequence of 
      FXTAS disease pathology. In this report we studied the relation between the 
      presence of neuronal intranuclear inclusions and behavioral deficits using an 
      inducible mouse model for FXTAS. Neuronal intranuclear inclusions were observed 4 
      weeks after dox-induction. After 12 weeks, high numbers of FMRpolyG-positive 
      intranuclear inclusions could be detected in the hippocampus and striatum, but no 
      clear signs of behavioral deficits related to these specific brain regions were 
      found. In conclusion, the observations in our inducible mouse model for FXTAS 
      suggest a lack of correlation between the presence of intranuclear 
      FMRpolyG-positive aggregates in brain regions and specific behavioral phenotypes.

TI  - Upper and Lower Limb Movement Kinematics in Aging FMR1 Gene Premutation Carriers.

LID - 13
AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative 
      disorder associated with a premutation cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion of the FMR1 gene. FXTAS is estimated to be the 
      most common single-gene form of ataxia in the aging population. Gait ataxia and 
      intention tremor are the primary behavioral symptoms of FXTAS, though clinical 
      evaluation of these symptoms often is subjective, contributing to difficulties in 
      reliably differentiating individuals with FXTAS and asymptomatic premutation 
      carriers. This study aimed to clarify the extent to which quantitative measures 
      of gait and upper limb kinematics may serve as biobehavioral markers of FXTAS 
      degeneration. Nineteen premutation carriers (aged 46-77 years), including 9 with 
      possible, probable, or definite FXTAS and 16 sex- and IQ-matched healthy 
      controls, completed tests of non-constrained walking and reaching while both 
      standing (static reaching) and walking (dynamic reaching) to quantify gait and 
      upper limb control, respectively. For the non-constrained walking task, 
      participants wore reflective markers and walked at their preferred speed on a 
      walkway. During the static reaching task, participants reached and lifted boxes 
      of different sizes while standing. During the dynamic reaching task, participants 
      walked to reach and lift the boxes. Movement kinematics were examined in relation 
      to clinical ratings of neuromotor impairments and CGG repeat length. During 
      non-constrained walking, individuals with FXTAS showed decreased stride lengths 
      and stride velocities, increased percentages of double support time, and 
      increased variabilities of cadence and center of mass relative to both 
      asymptomatic premutation carriers and controls. While individuals with FXTAS did 
      not show any static reaching differences relative to the other two groups, they 
      showed multiple differences during dynamic reaching trials, including reduced 
      maximum reaching velocity, prolonged acceleration time, and jerkier movement of 
      the shoulder, elbow, and hand. Gait differences during non-constrained walking 
      were associated with more severe clinically rated posture and gait symptoms. 
      Reduced maximum reaching velocity and increased jerkiness during dynamic reaching 
      were each related to more severe clinically rated kinetic dysfunction and overall 
      neuromotor symptoms in FMR1 premutation carriers. Our findings suggest kinematic 
      alterations consistent with gait ataxia and upper limb bradykinesia are each 
      selectively present in individuals with FXTAS, but not asymptomatic aging 
      premutation carriers. Consistent with neuropathological and magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) studies of FXTAS, these findings implicate cerebellar and basal 
      ganglia degeneration associated with neuromotor decline. Our results showing 
      associations between quantitative kinematic differences in FXTAS and clinical 
      ratings suggest that objective assessments of gait and reaching behaviors may 
      serve as critical and reliable targets for detecting FXTAS risk and monitoring 
      progression.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inheritable form of intellectual 
      disability. FMR1, the gene responsible for FXS, is located on human chromosome 
      Xq27.3 and contains a stretch of CGG trinucleotide repeats in its 5' untranslated 
      region. FXS is caused by CGG repeats that expand beyond 200, resulting in FMR1 
      silencing via promoter hypermethylation. The molecular mechanism underlying CGG 
      repeat expansion, a fundamental cause of FXS, remains poorly understood, partly 
      due to a lack of experimental systems. Accumulated evidence indicates that the 
      large chromosomal region flanking a CGG repeat is critical for repeat dynamics. 
      In the present study, we isolated and introduced whole human X chromosomes from 
      healthy, FXS premutation carriers, or FXS patients who carried disease 
      condition-associated CGG repeat lengths, into mouse A9 cells via 
      microcell-mediated chromosome transfer. The CGG repeat length-associated 
      methylation status and human FMR1 expression in these monochromosomal hybrid 
      cells mimicked those in humans. Thus, this set of A9 cells containing CGG repeats 
      from three different origins (FXS-A9 panel) may provide a valuable resource for 
      investigating a series of genetic and epigenetic CGG repeat dynamics during FXS 
      pathogenesis.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common monogenetic cause of intellectual 
      disability and autism spectrum disorders. Mostly, FXS is caused by 
      transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene due to a repeat expansion in the 5' 
      UTR, and consequently lack of the protein product FMRP. However, in rare cases 
      FXS is caused by other types of variants in the FMR1 gene. We describe a missense 
      variant in the FMR1 gene, identified through whole-exome sequencing, in a boy 
      with intellectual disability and behavioral problems. The variant is located in 
      the FMRP's nuclear export signal (NES). We performed expression and localization 
      studies of the variant in hair roots and HEK293 cells. Our results show normal 
      expression but significant retention of the FMRP in the cells' nucleus. This 
      finding suggests a possible FMRP reduction at its essential functional sites in 
      the dendrites and the synaptic compartments and possible interference of other 
      cellular processes in the nucleus. Together, this might lead to a FXS phenotype 
      in the boy.

TI  - Label-free Electrochemical Detection of CGG Repeats on Inkjet Printable 2D Layers 
      of MoS(2).
PG  - 52156-52165
LID - 10.1021/acsami.0c14912 [doi]
AB  - Flexible and ultrasensitive biosensing platforms capable of detecting a large 
      number of trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) are crucial for future technology 
      development needed to combat a variety of genetic disorders. For example, 
      trinucleotide CGG repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene can cause Fragile X syndrome 
      (FXS) and Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Current 
      state-of-the-art technologies to detect repeat sequences are expensive, while 
      relying on complicated procedures, and prone to false negatives. We reasoned that 
      two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum sulfide (MoS(2)) surfaces may be useful for 
      label-free electrochemical detection of CGG repeats due to its high affinity for 
      guanine bases. Here, we developed a low-cost and sensitive wax-on-plastic 
      electrochemical sensor using 2D MoS(2) ink for the detection of CGG repeats. The 
      ink containing few-layered MoS(2) nanosheets was prepared and characterized using 
      optical, electrical, electrochemical, and electron microscopic methods. The 
      devices were characterized by electron microscopic and electrochemical methods. 
      Repetitive CGG DNA was adsorbed on a MoS(2) surface in a high cationic strength 
      environment and the electrocatalytic current of the CGG/MoS(2) interface was 
      recorded using a soluble Fe(CN)(6)(-3/-4) redox probe by differential pulse 
      voltammetry (DPV). The dynamic range for the detection of prehybridized duplexes 
      ranged from 1 aM to 100 nM with a 3.0 aM limit of detection. A detection range of 
      100 fM to 1 nM was recorded for surface hybridization events. Using this method, 
      we were able to observe selectivity of MoS(2) for CGG repeats and distinguish 
      nonpathogenic from disease-associated repeat lengths. The detection of CGG repeat 
      sequences on inkjet printable 2D MoS(2) surfaces is a forward step toward 
      developing chip-based rapid and label-free sensors for the detection of repeat 
      expansion sequences.

TI  - A Genotype-Phenotype Study of High-Resolution FMR1 Nucleic Acid and Protein 
      Analyses in Fragile X Patients with Neurobehavioral Assessments.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci10100694 [doi]
LID - 694
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by silencing of the FMR1 gene, which encodes a 
      protein with a critical role in synaptic plasticity. The molecular abnormality 
      underlying FMR1 silencing, CGG repeat expansion, is well characterized; however, 
      delineation of the pathway from DNA to RNA to protein using biosamples from well 
      characterized patients with FXS is limited. Since FXS is a common and 
      prototypical genetic disorder associated with intellectual disability (ID) and 
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a comprehensive assessment of the FMR1 
      DNA-RNA-protein pathway and its correlations with the neurobehavioral phenotype 
      is a priority. We applied nine sensitive and quantitative assays evaluating FMR1 
      DNA, RNA, and FMRP parameters to a reference set of cell lines representing the 
      range of FMR1 expansions. We then used the most informative of these assays on 
      blood and buccal specimens from cohorts of patients with different FMR1 
      expansions, with emphasis on those with FXS (N = 42 total, N = 31 with FMRP 
      measurements). The group with FMRP data was also evaluated comprehensively in 
      terms of its neurobehavioral profile, which allowed molecular-neurobehavioral 
      correlations. FMR1 CGG repeat expansions, methylation levels, and FMRP levels, in 
      both cell lines and blood samples, were consistent with findings of previous FMR1 
      genomic and protein studies. They also demonstrated a high level of agreement 
      between blood and buccal specimens. These assays further corroborated previous 
      reports of the relatively high prevalence of methylation mosaicism (slightly over 
      50% of the samples). Molecular-neurobehavioral correlations confirmed the inverse 
      relationship between overall severity of the FXS phenotype and decrease in FMRP 
      levels (N = 26 males, mean 4.2 +/- 3.3 pg FMRP/ng genomic DNA). Other intriguing 
      findings included a significant relationship between the diagnosis of FXS with 
      ASD and two-fold lower levels of FMRP (mean 2.8 +/- 1.3 pg FMRP/ng genomic DNA, p = 
      0.04), in particular observed in younger age- and IQ-adjusted males (mean age 6.9 
      +/- 0.9 years with mean 3.2 +/- 1.2 pg FMRP/ng genomic DNA, 57% with severe ASD), 
      compared to FXS without ASD. Those with severe ID had even lower FMRP levels 
      independent of ASD status in the male-only subset. The results underscore the 
      link between FMR1 expansion, gene methylation, and FMRP deficit. The association 
      between FMRP deficiency and overall severity of the neurobehavioral phenotype 
      invites follow up studies in larger patient cohorts. They would be valuable to 
      confirm and potentially extend our initial findings of the relationship between 
      ASD and other neurobehavioral features and the magnitude of FMRP deficit. 
      Molecular profiling of individuals with FXS may have important implications in 
      research and clinical practice.

TI  - Coexistence of Fragile-X Syndrome, 8p23.1 Deletion, and Balanced Translocation 
      t(7;10)(p10;q24) in a Single Family.
PG  - 527-531
LID - 10.1089/gtmb.2019.0276 [doi]
AB  - Aims: Fragile-X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual 
      disability; it is caused by an abnormal CGG-repeat expansion at the FMR1 gene. 
      However, a few cases of girls with mutations in the FMR1 gene have been reported 
      in the literature. In this study, we describe the clinical and genetic assessment 
      of a family who exhibits the unusual coexistence of FXS, an 8p23.1 deletion, and 
      balanced translocation t(7;10)(p10;q24) in multiple members, including a 
      symptomatic girl with FXS. Materials and Methods: All of the family members 
      underwent comprehensive clinical and neurological examinations. All members of 
      the family were also molecularly diagnosed using a combination of 
      fluorescent-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Triplet Repeat Primed-PCR, capillary 
      electrophoresis, and karyotyping. Results: We identified a male proband and a 
      female patient that presented with the craniofacial characteristics of FXS, 
      neuropsychomotor developmental delay, speech delay, intellectual deficit, and a 
      positive molecular diagnosis of FXS. Interestingly, the female patient presented 
      with a severe phenotype also associated with the presence of 8p23.1 deletion, 
      while the proband patient presented a balanced translocation t(7;10)(p10;q24). 
      Moreover, we detected multiple carriers of the FXS premutation in the family. 
      Conclusions: To our knowledge, we describe for the first time the simultaneous 
      occurrence of FXS and an 8p23.1 deletion and their possible synergistic effects 
      on the phenotype of a female patient. Moreover, we describe the coexistence of 
      FXS, an 8p23.1 deletion, and a balanced translocation t(7;10)(p10;q24) in the 
      same family.

AB  - The Fragile-X related disorders (FXDs) are Repeat Expansion Diseases (REDs) that 
      result from expansion of a CGG-repeat tract located at the 5' end of the FMR1 
      gene. While expansion affects transmission risk and can also affect disease risk 
      and severity, the underlying molecular mechanism responsible is unknown. Despite 
      the fact that expanded alleles can be seen both in humans and mouse models in 
      vivo, existing patient-derived cells do not show significant repeat expansions 
      even after extended periods in culture. In order to develop a good tissue culture 
      model for studying expansions we tested whether mouse embryonic stem cells 
      (mESCs) carrying an expanded CGG repeat tract in the endogenous Fmr1 gene are 
      permissive for expansion. We show here that these mESCs have a very high 
      frequency of expansion that allows changes in the repeat number to be seen within 
      a matter of days. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of these cells suggests that this may 
      be due in part to the fact that non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), which is able 
      to protect against expansions in some cell types, is not effective in mESCs. 
      CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing also shows that these expansions are MSH2-dependent, 
      consistent with those seen in vivo. While comparable human Genome Wide 
      Association (GWA) studies are not available for the FXDs, such studies have 
      implicated MSH2 in expansion in other REDs. The shared unusual requirement for 
      MSH2 for this type of microsatellite instability suggests that this new 
      cell-based system is relevant for understanding the mechanism responsible for 
      this peculiar type of mutation in humans. The high frequency of expansions and 
      the ease of gene editing these cells should expedite the identification of 
      factors that affect expansion risk. Additionally, we found that, as with cells 
      from human premutation (PM) carriers, these cell lines have elevated 
      mitochondrial copy numbers and Fmr1 hyperexpression, that we show here is 
      O(2)-sensitive. Thus, this new stem cell model should facilitate studies of both 
      repeat expansion and the consequences of expansion during early embryonic 
      development.

AB  - The major and most well-studied genetic cause of Fragile-X syndrome (FXS) is 
      expansion of a CGG repeat in the 5'-UTR of the FMR1 gene. Routine testing for 
      this expansion is performed globally. Overall, there is a paucity of intragenic 
      variants explaining FXS, a fact which is being addressed by a more systematic 
      application of whole exome (WES) and whole genome (WGS) sequencing, even in the 
      diagnostic setting. Here we report two families comprising probands with a 
      clinical suspicion of FXS and no CGG repeat expansions. Using WES/WGS we 
      identified deleterious variants within the coding region of FMR1 in both 
      families. In a family from Finland we identified a complex indel 
      c.1021-1028delinsTATTGG in exon 11 of FMR1 which gives rise to a frameshift and a 
      premature termination codon (PTC), p.Asn341Tyrfs*7. Follow-up mRNA and protein 
      studies on a cell line from the proband revealed that although the mRNA levels of 
      FMR1 were not altered, Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 Protein (FMRP) was 
      undetectable. Additionally, we identified a variant, c.881-1G > T, affecting the 
      canonical acceptor splice site of exon 10 of FMR1 in an Australian family. Our 
      findings reinforce the importance of intragenic FMR1 variant testing, 
      particularly in cases with clinical features of FXS and no CGG repeat expansions 
      identified.

AB  - Expansion of a CGG-repeat tract in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene 
      causes the fragile X-related disorders (FXDs; aka the FMR1 disorders). The 
      expansion mechanism is likely shared by the 35+ other diseases resulting from 
      expansion of a disease-specific microsatellite, but many steps in this process 
      are unknown. We have shown previously that expansion is dependent upon functional 
      mismatch repair proteins, including an absolute requirement for MutLgamma, one of the 
      three MutL heterodimeric complexes found in mammalian cells. We demonstrate here 
      that both MutLalpha and MutLbeta, the two other MutL complexes present in mammalian 
      cells, are also required for most, if not all, expansions in a mouse embryonic 
      stem cell model of the FXDs. A role for MutLalpha and MutLbeta is consistent with human 
      GWA studies implicating these complexes as modifiers of expansion risk in other 
      Repeat Expansion Diseases. The requirement for all three complexes suggests a 
      novel model in which these complexes co-operate to generate expansions. It also 
      suggests that the PMS1 subunit of MutLbeta may be a reasonable therapeutic target in 
      those diseases in which somatic expansion is an important disease modifier.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a monogenic disorder and a common cause 
      of intellectual disability (ID). Up to now, very few pathological variants other 
      than the typical CGG-repeat expansion have been reported in the FMR1 gene. 
      METHODS: A panel of 56 intellectual disability (ID) genes including the FMR1 gene 
      was sequenced in a cohort of 300 patients with unexplained ID. To determine the 
      effect of a new FMR1 variant, total RNA from peripheral blood cells was reverse 
      transcribed, amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. RESULTS: We 
      report a novel G to A point variant (c.801G > A) located at the last nucleotide 
      of exon 8 in the FMR1 gene in one patient with ID. Direct sequencing of the 
      RT-PCR products revealed that the transcript from the allele with G to A variant 
      skips exon 8 entirely, resulting in a joining of exons 7 and 9. Skipping of exon 
      8 may result in an abnormal FMR1 protein (FMRP), which removes the highly 
      conserved region that encoding the KH1 domain of FMRP. CONCLUSIONS: This report 
      describes for the first time that a synonymous variant in the FMR1 gene is 
      associated with an error in mRNA processing, leading preferentially to the 
      production of an aberrant transcript without exon 8. This splice variant was 
      associated with an unspecific clinical presentation, suggesting the need for more 
      detailed investigation of silent variants in ID patients with a large spectrum of 
      phenotypes.

      region of the FMR1 gene. When the number of repeats exceeds 200, the gene becomes 
      hypermethylated and is transcriptionally silenced, resulting in FXS. Other 
      allelic forms of the gene that are studied because of their instability or 
      phenotypic consequence include intermediate alleles (45-54 CGG repeats) and 
      premutation alleles (55-200 repeats). Normal alleles are classified as having <45 
      CGG repeats. Population screening studies have been conducted among American and 
      Australian populations; however, large population-based studies have not been 
      completed in China. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this work we present FXS screening 
      results from 10,145 women of childbearing age from China. We first created and 
      tested a standard panel that was comprised of normal, intermediate, premutation, 
      and full mutation samples, and we performed the screening after confirming the 
      consistency of genotyping results among laboratories. CONCLUSION: Based on our 
      findings, we have determined the intermediate and premutation carrier prevalence 
      of 1/130 and 1/634, respectively, among Chinese women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a 
      neurodegenerative disorder characterized by intention tremor, cerebellar ataxia, 
      and executive dysfunction in carriers of a CGG repeat expansion premutation 
      (55-200 repeats) in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Given reports 
      of poor insight in FXTAS, we postulated that patients with FXTAS would be less 
      likely to exhibit placebo response. OBJECTIVE: To analyze placebo response from 
      the first randomized controlled trial in FXTAS that evaluated cognitive and motor 
      outcomes after 1 year of treatment with memantine. METHODS: Data from the placebo 
      arm of the first randomized controlled trial in FXTAS were analyzed. There were 2 
      coprimary outcomes. Based on studies in Parkinson's disease, placebo responders 
      were defined as individuals with an improvement of at least 50% in the coprimary 
      outcomes. Improvements of 20% and 30% served as secondary cutoff values based on 
      the suggested magnitude of placebo response in other movement disorders. RESULTS: 
      A total of 36 participants in the placebo group completed baseline and follow-up 
      evaluations. The average age was 66 +/- 7 years, and 60% were men. Average CGG 
      repeat size was 86 +/- 18. A total of 19 participants had stage 3 disease. Only 1 
      patient showed 50% improvement in both coprimary outcomes. At 30% and 20% 
      improvement, there were 2 and 3 patients showing placebo response in the 
      coprimary outcomes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with FXTAS exhibited low 
      rates of placebo response in a randomized controlled trial. Further studies on 
      the relationship between baseline insight and placebo responsivity are applicable 
      to FXTAS and other disorders exhibiting cognitive impairment.

TI  - Urine microRNA Pro fi ling Displays miR-125a Dysregulation in Children with Fragile 
      X Syndrome.
LID - 10.3390/cells9020289 [doi]
LID - 289
AB  - A triplet repeat expansion leading to transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene 
      results in fragile X syndrome (FXS), which is a common cause of inherited 
      intellectual disability and autism. Phenotypic variation requires personalized 
      treatment approaches and hampers clinical trials in FXS. We searched for microRNA 
      (miRNA) biomarkers for FXS using deep sequencing of urine and identi fi ed 28 
      differentially regulated miRNAs when 219 reliably identi fi ed miRNAs were compared 
      in dizygotic twin boys who shared the same environment, but one had an FXS full 
      mutation, and the other carried a premutation allele. The largest increase was 
      found in miR-125a in the FXS sample, and the miR-125a levels were increased in 
      two independent sets of urine samples from a total of 19 FXS children. Urine 
      miR-125a levels appeared to increase with age in control subjects, but varied 
      widely in FXS subjects. Should the results be generalized, it could suggest that 
      two FXS subgroups existed. Predicted gene targets of the differentially regulated 
      miRNAs are involved in molecular pathways that regulate developmental processes, 
      homeostasis, and neuronal function. Regulation of miR-125a has been associated 
      with type I metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling (mGluR), which has been 
      explored as a treatment target for FXS, reinforcing the possibility that urine 
      miR-125a may provide a novel biomarker for FXS.

TI  - Repeat expansion and methylation-sensitive triplet-primed polymerase chain 
      reaction for fragile X mental retardation 1 gene screening in institutionalised 
      intellectually disabled individuals.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most prevalent X-linked 
      intellectual disability (ID) and a leading genetic cause of autism, characterised 
      by cognitive and behavioural impairments. The hyperexpansion of a CGG repeat in 
      the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene leads to abnormal 
      hypermethylation, resulting in the lack or absence of its protein. Tools for 
      establishing the diagnosis of FXS have been extensively developed, including 
      assays based on triplet-primed polymerase chain reaction (TP-PCR) for detection 
      and quantification of the CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion, as well as 
      determination of the methylation status of the alleles. This study aimed to 
      utilise a simple, quick and affordable method for high sensitivity and 
      specificity screening and diagnosis of FXS in institutionalised individuals with 
      ID. METHODS: A total of 109 institutionalised individuals at the Center for 
      Social Rehabilitation of Intellectual Disability Kartini, Temanggung, Central 
      Java, Indonesia, were screened in a three-step process using FastFrax 
      Identification, Sizing and Methylation Status Kits. RESULTS: Two samples that 
      were classified as indeterminate with respect to the 41-repeat control at the 
      identification step were subsequently determined to be non-expanded by both 
      sizing and methylation status analyses. Two samples classified as expanded at the 
      identification step were determined to carry full mutation expansions > 200 
      repeats that were fully methylated using sizing and methylation status analyses, 
      respectively, yielding a disease prevalence of 1.83%. CONCLUSION: Repeat 
      expansion and methylation-specific TP-PCR is practical, effective and inexpensive 
      for the diagnosis of FXS, especially in high-risk populations of individuals with 
      ID of undetermined aetiology.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome, the leading heritable form of intellectual disability, is 
      caused by hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of large (CGG) repeat 
      expansions (> 200 repeats) in the 5' untranslated region of the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. As a consequence of FMR1 gene silencing, there is 
      little or no production of FMR1 protein (FMRP), an important element in normal 
      synaptic function. Although the absence of FMRP has long been known to be 
      responsible for the cognitive impairment in fragile X syndrome, the relationship 
      between FMRP level and cognitive ability (IQ) is only imprecisely understood. To 
      address this issue, a high-throughput, fluorescence resonance energy transfer 
      (FRET) assay has been used to quantify FMRP levels in dermal fibroblasts, and the 
      relationship between FMRP and IQ measures was assessed by statistical analysis in 
      a cohort of 184 individuals with CGG-repeat lengths spanning normal (< 45 CGGs) 
      to full mutation (> 200 CGGs) repeat ranges in fibroblasts. The principal 
      findings of the current study are twofold: i) For those with normal CGG repeats, 
      IQ is no longer sensitive to further increases in FMRP above an FMRP threshold of 
      ~70% of the mean FMRP level; below this threshold, IQ decreases steeply with 
      further decreases in FMRP; and ii) For the current cohort, a mean IQ of 85 (lower 
      bound for the normal IQ range) is attained for FMRP levels that are only ~35% of 
      the mean FMRP level among normal CGG-repeat controls. The current results should 
      help guide expectations for efforts to induce FMR1 gene activity and for the 
      levels of cognitive function expected for a given range of FMRP levels.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common genetic form of intellectual 
      disability caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the 5'-UTR of the Fragile X mental 
      retardation gene FMR1, triggering epigenetic silencing and the subsequent absence 
      of the protein, FMRP. Reactivation of FMR1 represents an attractive therapeutic 
      strategy targeting the genetic root cause of FXS. However, largely missing in the 
      FXS field is an understanding of how much FMR1 reactivation is required to rescue 
      FMRP-dependent mutant phenotypes. Here, we utilize FXS patient-derived excitatory 
      neurons to model FXS in vitro and confirm that the absence of FMRP leads to 
      neuronal hyperactivity. We further determined the levels of FMRP and the 
      percentage of FMRP-positive cells necessary to correct this phenotype utilizing a 
      mixed and mosaic neuronal culture system and a combination of CRISPR, antisense 
      and expression technologies to titrate FMRP in FXS and WT neurons. Our data 
      demonstrate that restoration of greater than 5% of overall FMRP expression levels 
      or greater than 20% FMRP-expressing neurons in a mosaic pattern is sufficient to 
      normalize a FMRP-dependent, hyperactive phenotype in FXS iPSC-derived neurons.

AB  - Newborn screening is designed for presymptomatic identification of serious 
      conditions with effective early interventions. Clinical laboratories must perform 
      prospective pilot studies to ensure that the analytical performance and workflow 
      for a given screening test are appropriate. We assessed the potential to screen 
      newborns for fragile X syndrome, a monogenic neurodevelopmental disorder, by 
      establishing a customized, high-throughput PCR and analysis software system 
      designed to detect fragile X mental retardation 1 gene repeat expansions from 
      dried blood spots (DBSs). Assay precision, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity 
      were characterized across the categorical range of repeat expansions. The assay 
      consistently resolved genotypes within three CGG repeats of reference values up 
      to at least 137 repeats and within six repeats for larger expansions up to 200 
      repeats. Accuracy testing results were concordant with reference results. Full 
      and premutation alleles were detected from subnanogram DNA inputs eluted from 
      DBSs and from mixtures with down to 1% relative abundance of the respective 
      expansion. Analysis of 963 deidentified newborn DBS samples identified 957 normal 
      and 6 premutation specimens, consistent with previously published prevalence 
      estimates. These studies demonstrate that the assay system can support 
      high-throughput newborn screening programs.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a rare disorder associated 
      to the presence of the fragile X premutation, a 55-200 CGG repeat expansion in 
      the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene. Two main neurological phenotypes have been described 
      in carriers of the CGG premutation: (1) neurodevelopmental disorders 
      characterized by anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), social 
      deficits, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD); and (2) after 50 years old, the 
      FXTAS phenotype. This neurodegenerative disorder is characterized by ataxia and a 
      form of parkinsonism. The molecular pathology of this disorder is characterized 
      by the presence of elevated levels of Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) mRNA, 
      presence of a repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translated peptide, and FMR1 
      mRNA-containing nuclear inclusions. Whereas in the past FXTAS was mainly 
      considered as a late-onset disorder, some phenotypes of patients and altered 
      learning and memory behavior of a mouse model of FXTAS suggested that this 
      disorder involves neurodevelopment. To better understand the physiopathological 
      role of the increased levels of Fmr1 mRNA during neuronal differentiation, we 
      used a small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach to reduce the abundance of this 
      mRNA in cultured cortical neurons from the FXTAS mouse model. Morphological 
      alterations of neurons were rescued by this approach. This cellular phenotype is 
      associated to differentially expressed proteins that we identified by mass 
      spectrometry analysis. Interestingly, phenotype rescue is also associated to the 
      rescue of the abundance of 29 proteins that are involved in various pathways, 
      which represent putative targets for early therapeutic approaches.

AB  - CGG repeat expansions in FMR1 cause the neurodegenerative disorder Fragile 
      X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS). Ubiquitinated neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusions (NIIs) are the neuropathological hallmark of FXTAS. Both sense strand 
      derived CGG repeats and antisense strand derived CCG repeats support non-AUG 
      initiated (RAN) translation of homopolymeric proteins in potentially 6 different 
      reading frames. However, the relative abundance of these proteins in FXTAS brains 
      and their co-localization with each other and NIIs is lacking. Here we describe 
      rater-blinded assessment of immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining 
      with newly generated antibodies to different CGG RAN translation products in 
      FXTAS and control brains as well as co-staining with ubiquitin, p62/SQSTM1, and 
      ubiquilin 2. We find that both FMRpolyG and a second CGG repeat derived RAN 
      translation product, FMRpolyA, accumulate in aggregates in FXTAS brains. FMRpolyG 
      is a near-obligate component of both ubiquitin-positive and p62-positive NIIs in 
      FXTAS, with occurrence of aggregates in 20% of all hippocampal neurons and > 90% 
      of all inclusions. A subset of these inclusions also stain positive for the 
      ALS/FTD associated protein ubiquilin 2. Ubiquitinated inclusions and FMRpolyG+ 
      aggregates are rarer in cortex and cerebellum. Intriguingly, FMRpolyG staining is 
      also visible in control neuronal nuclei. In contrast to FMRpolyG, staining for 
      FMRpolyA and CCG antisense derived RAN translation products were less abundant 
      and less frequent components of ubiquitinated inclusions. In conclusion, RAN 
      translated FMRpolyG is a common component of ubiquitin and p62 positive 
      inclusions in FXTAS patient brains.

AB  - Analysis of individual gametes has a number of applications in the study of the 
      mechanism of repeat expansion in mouse models of the fragile X-related disorders, 
      as well as in mouse models of other repeat expansion diseases. This chapter 
      describes the techniques required to isolate oocytes and male gametes of 
      different stages of maturity, along with the techniques required to accurately 
      determine the repeat number in these gametes.

AB  - Expansions of simple trinucleotide repeats, such as (CGG)(n), (CAG)(n) or 
      (GAA)(n), are responsible for more than 40 hereditary disorders in humans 
      including fragile X syndrome, Huntington's disease, myotonic dystrophy, and 
      Friedreich's ataxia. While the mechanisms of repeat expansions were intensively 
      studied for over two decades, the final picture has yet to emerge. It was 
      important, therefore, to develop a mammalian experimental system for studying 
      repeat instability, which would recapitulate repeat instability observed in human 
      pedigrees. Here, we describe a genetically tractable experimental system to study 
      the instability of (CGG)(n) repeats in cultured mammalian cells (Kononenko et 
      al., Nat Struct Mol Biol 25:669-676, 2018). It is based on a selectable cassette 
      carrying the HyTK gene under the control of the FMR1 promoter with carrier-size 
      (CGG)(n) repeats in its 5' UTR, which was integrated into the unique RL5 site in 
      murine erythroid leukemia cells. Expansions of these repeats and/or 
      repeat-induced mutagenesis shut down the reporter, which results in the 
      accumulation of ganciclovir-resistance cells. This system is useful for 
      understanding the genetic controls of repeat instability in mammalian cells. In 
      the long run, it can be adjusted to screen for drugs that either alleviate repeat 
      expansions or reactivate the FMR1 promoter.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative 
      disorder associated with a premutation repeat expansion (55-200 CGG repeats) in 
      the 5' noncoding region of the FMR1 gene. Solitary intranuclear inclusions within 
      FXTAS neurons and astrocytes constitute a hallmark of the disorder, yet our 
      understanding of how and why these bodies form is limited. Here, we have 
      discovered that FXTAS inclusions emit a distinct autofluorescence spectrum, which 
      forms the basis of a novel, unbiased method for isolating FXTAS inclusions by 
      preparative fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Using a combination of 
      autofluorescence-based FACS and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomics, we have identified more than two hundred proteins 
      that are enriched within the inclusions relative to FXTAS whole nuclei. Whereas 
      no single protein species dominates inclusion composition, highly enriched levels 
      of conjugated small ubiquitin-related modifier 2 (SUMO 2) protein and 
      p62/sequestosome-1 (p62/SQSTM1) protein were found within the inclusions. Many 
      additional proteins involved with RNA binding, protein turnover, and DNA damage 
      repair were enriched within inclusions relative to total nuclear protein. The 
      current analysis has also allowed the first direct detection, through peptide 
      sequencing, of endogenous FMRpolyG peptide, the product of repeat-associated 
      non-ATG (RAN) translation of the FMR1 mRNA. However, this peptide was found only 
      at extremely low levels and not within whole FXTAS nuclear preparations, raising 
      the question whether endogenous RAN products exist at quantities sufficient to 
      contribute to FXTAS pathogenesis. The abundance of the inclusion-associated 
      ubiquitin- and SUMO-based modifiers supports a model for inclusion formation as 
      the result of increased protein loads and elevated oxidative stress leading to 
      maladaptive autophagy. These results highlight the need to further investigate 
      FXTAS pathogenesis in the context of endogenous systems.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked dominant disorder and the most common cause of 
      inherited mental retardation. It is caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion in 
      the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) at the Xq27.3. The expansion 
      blocks expression of the gene product, Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein 
      (FMRP). The syndrome includes mild to moderate mental retardation and behavioral 
      manifestations such as tactile defensiveness, gaze avoidance, repetitive motor 
      mannerisms, perseverative (repetitive) speech, hyperarousal and it frequently 
      includes seizures. This behavioral phenotype overlaps significantly with autism 
      spectrum disorder. The knockout mice lack normal Fmr1 protein and show 
      macro-orchidism, learning deficits, and hyperactivity. Consequently, this 
      knockout mouse may serve as a valuable tool in the elucidation of the 
      physiological role of FMR1 and the mechanisms involved in macroorchidism, 
      abnormal behavior, abnormalities comparable to those of human fragile X patients. 
      In this study we evaluated the effects of taurine on the testicular physiology to 
      better understand the cellular mechanisms underlying macro-orchidism. We found 
      that there was a significant decrease in the number of Leydig cells in the testis 
      of fragile X mouse. Furthermore, the expression of somatostatin was drastically 
      decreased and differential expression pattern of CDK5 in fragile X mouse testis. 
      In the control testis, CDK is expressed in primary and secondary spermatids 
      whereas in the Fmr1 ko mice CDK 5 is expressed mainly in spermatogonia. Taurine 
      supplementation led to an increase in CDK5 expression in both controls and Ko 
      mice. CDKs (Cyclin-dependent kinases) are a group of serine/threonine protein 
      kinases activated by binding to a regulatory subunit cyclin. Over 20 functionally 
      diverse proteins involved in cytoskeleton dynamics, cell adhesion, transport, and 
      membrane trafficking act as CDK5 substrates elucidating the molecular mechanisms 
      of CDK5 function. CDK5 phosphorylates a diverse list of substrates, implicating 
      it in the regulation of a range of cellular processes. CDK5 is expressed in 
      Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, spermatogonia and peritubular cells indicating a 
      role in spermatogenesis. In this study we examined the expression levels of CDK5 
      and how it is affected by taurine supplementation in the testes and found that 
      taurine plays an important role in testicular physiology and corrected some of 
      the pathophysiology observed in the fragile x mouse testis.

AB  - A CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of FMR1 causes the 
      neurodegenerative disorder Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). 
      This repeat supports a non-canonical mode of protein synthesis known as 
      repeat-associated, non-AUG (RAN) translation. The mechanism underlying RAN 
      translation at CGG repeats remains unclear. To identify modifiers of RAN 
      translation and potential therapeutic targets, we performed a candidate-based 
      screen of eukaryotic initiation factors and RNA helicases in cell-based assays 
      and a Drosophila melanogaster model of FXTAS. We identified multiple modifiers of 
      toxicity and RAN translation from an expanded CGG repeat in the context of the 
      FMR1 5'UTR. These include the DEAD-box RNA helicase belle/DDX3X, the helicase 
      accessory factors EIF4B/4H, and the start codon selectivity factors EIF1 and 
      EIF5. Disrupting belle/DDX3X selectively inhibited FMR1 RAN translation in 
      Drosophila in vivo and cultured human cells, and mitigated repeat-induced 
      toxicity in Drosophila and primary rodent neurons. These findings implicate RNA 
      secondary structure and start codon fidelity as critical elements mediating FMR1 
      RAN translation and identify potential targets for treating repeat-associated 
      neurodegeneration.

AB  - The gut microbiota is important for maintaining homeostasis of the host. Gut 
      microbes represent the initial site for toxicant processing following dietary 
      exposures to environmental contaminants. The diet is the primary route of 
      exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which are absorbed via the gut, and 
      subsequently interfere with neurodevelopment and behavior. Developmental 
      exposures to PCBs have been linked to increased risk of neurodevelopmental 
      disorders (NDD), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which are also 
      associated with a high prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) distress and 
      intestinal dysbiosis. We hypothesized that developmental PCB exposure impacts 
      colonization of the gut microbiota, resulting in GI pathophysiology, in a 
      genetically susceptible host. Mouse dams expressing two heritable human mutations 
      (double mutants [DM]) that result in abnormal Ca(2+) dynamics and produce 
      behavioral deficits (gain of function mutation in the ryanodine receptor 1 
      [T4826I-RYR1] and a human CGG repeat expansion [170-200 CGG repeats] in the 
      fragile X mental retardation gene 1 [FMR1 premutation]). DM and congenic wild 
      type (WT) controls were exposed to PCBs (0-6...mg/kg/d) in the diet starting 2 
      weeks before gestation and continuing through postnatal day 21 (P21). Intestinal 
      physiology (Ussing chambers), inflammation (qPCR) and gut microbiome (16S 
      sequencing) studies were performed in offspring mice (P28-P30). Developmental 
      exposure to PCBs in the maternal diet caused significant mucosal barrier defects 
      in ileum and colon (increased secretory state and tight junction permeability) of 
      juvenile DM mice. Furthermore, PCB exposure increased the intestinal inflammatory 
      profile (Il6, Il1beta, and Il22), and resulted in dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, 
      including altered beta-diversity, in juvenile DM mice developmentally exposed to 
      1...mg/kg/d PCBs when compared to WT controls. Collectively, these findings 
      demonstrate a novel interaction between PCB exposure and the gut microbiota in a 
      genetically susceptible host that provide novel insight into environmental risk 
      factors for neurodevelopmental disorders.

TI  - Noncoding CGG repeat expansions in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease, 
      oculopharyngodistal myopathy and an overlapping disease.
PG  - 1222-1232
LID - 10.1038/s41588-019-0458-z [doi]
AB  - Noncoding repeat expansions cause various neuromuscular diseases, including 
      myotonic dystrophies, fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome, some spinocerebellar 
      ataxias, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and benign adult familial myoclonic 
      epilepsies. Inspired by the striking similarities in the clinical and 
      neuroimaging findings between neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) and 
      fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome caused by noncoding CGG repeat expansions in 
      FMR1, we directly searched for repeat expansion mutations and identified 
      noncoding CGG repeat expansions in NBPF19 (NOTCH2NLC) as the causative mutations 
      for NIID. Further prompted by the similarities in the clinical and neuroimaging 
      findings with NIID, we identified similar noncoding CGG repeat expansions in two 
      other diseases: oculopharyngeal myopathy with leukoencephalopathy and 
      oculopharyngodistal myopathy, in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 and LRP12, respectively. 
      These findings expand our knowledge of the clinical spectra of diseases caused by 
      expansions of the same repeat motif, and further highlight how directly searching 
      for expanded repeats can help identify mutations underlying diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome is a late-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder that affects about 40% of carriers of CGG-repeat 
      expansions in the premutation range within the fragile X gene (FMR1). Main 
      clinical features include intention tremor, cerebellar ataxia, and parkinsonism. 
      Recently, great emphasis on the deposition of soluble aggregates produced by a 
      RAN translation process, as main pathogenic mechanism, has been given. These 
      aggregates contain a small protein with a polyglycine stretch on the 
      aminoterminal end named FMRpolyG and, so far, have been isolated and 
      characterized in drosophila and mouse models, in post mortem brain of fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome patients, in fibroblasts of fragile primary 
      ovarian insufficiency patients, but never in fibroblasts from a fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia living patients. In adult carriers the syndrome is 
      frequently misdiagnosed due to the lack of specific markers. METHODS: We 
      standardized immunocytochemistry, immunoprecipitation and western blot procedures 
      to study and biochemically characterize the FMRpolyG protein in fibroblasts from 
      human skin biopsy. RESULTS: We demonstrate for the first time, in fibroblasts 
      from a patient affected by Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, the 
      presence ex vivo of inclusions consisting of FMRpolyG- Hsp70 soluble aggregates. 
      CONCLUSION: These observations can pave the way to develop a cellular model for 
      studying ex vivo and in vitro the mechanisms involved in the production of 
      FMRpolyG aggregates, their toxicity, and the role of the FMRpolyG-Hsp70 
      interaction in the pathogenesis of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome.

TI  - Piperine Modulates Protein Mediated Toxicity in Fragile X-Associated 
      Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome through Interacting Expanded CGG Repeat (r(CGG)(exp)) RNA.
PG  - 3778-3788
LID - 10.1021/acschemneuro.9b00282 [doi]
AB  - An expansion of CGG tandem repeats in the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) of 
      fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene causes fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). The transcripts of these expanded repeats 
      r(CGG)(exp) either form RNA foci or undergo the repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) 
      translation that produces toxic homopolymeric proteins in neuronal cells. The 
      discovery of small molecule modulators that possess a strong binding affinity and 
      high selectivity to these toxic expanded repeats RNA could be a promising 
      therapeutic approach to cure the expanded repeat-associated neurological 
      diseases. Therefore, here we sought to test the therapeutic potential of a 
      natural alkaloid, piperine, by assessing its ability to bind and neutralize the 
      toxicity of r(CGG)(exp) RNA motif. To accomplish this first, we have determined 
      the affinity of piperine to r(CGG)(exp) RNA using fluorescence-based binding 
      assay and isothermal titration calorimetry assay. These assays showed that 
      piperine forms a thermodynamically favorable interaction with r(CGG)(exp) RNA 
      with high selectivity to the G-rich RNA motif. Interaction of piperine with 
      r(CGG)(exp) motif was further validated using several biophysical techniques such 
      as CD, CD melting, NMR spectroscopy, and gel retardation assay. Moreover, 
      piperine was also found to be effective for improving the r(CGG)(exp) associated 
      splicing defects and RAN translation in a FXTAS cell model system. Our results 
      effectively provided the evidence that piperine strongly interacts with 
      r(CGG)(exp) RNA and could be used as a suitable candidate for therapeutic 
      development against FXTAS.

TI  - Fragile X molecular investigation and genetic counseling of intellectual 
      disability/developmental delay patients in an Indian scenario.
PG  - 641-649
LID - 10.1080/14737159.2019.1622416 [doi]
AB  - Background: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of inherited 
      intellectual disability (ID), is caused by a CGG repeat expansion (full mutation 
      (FM), >200 CGG) at the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Early 
      identification of FXS has prognostic significance for affected individuals due to 
      early initiation of interventions. Genetic counseling and family screening can 
      aid parents and at-risk asymptomatic carriers (premutation (PM), 55-200 CGG) in 
      taking proper reproductive decisions. Methodology: The present study utilizes 
      Triplet Primed-Polymerase Chain Reaction (TP-PCR) methodology for detecting the 
      repeat expansion at FMR1 gene in 233 Indian intellectual disability/developmental 
      delay (ID/DD) patients. Results: We have identified 18/233 (7.7%) FXS positive 
      cases. Early diagnosis was made in 66.7% cases (<10 years). Extended family 
      screening in 14 affected individuals identified 9 additional FM cases (7 males 
      and 2 females) and 23 carrier PM females, which otherwise could have been missed. 
      Four prenatal diagnoses were also performed, leading to the identification of 1 
      PM and 1 FM carrier fetus. Conclusion: A high frequency (7.7%) of FXS among 
      Indian ID/DD subjects obtained in this study depicted the need for more 
      professional recommendations concerning prompt referral for genetic testing, and 
      increased exposure to information about FXS to pediatricians.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of CGG repeat expansion mutation in FMR1 gene varies 
      among different populations. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of 
      this mutation in women of reproductive age from northern China. METHODS: A total 
      of 11,891 pre-conceptional or pregnant women, including 5037 pregnant women and 
      7357 women with the history of spontaneous abortion or induced abortion due to 
      delayed growth of the embryos, were recruited. The number of CGG repeats in FMR1 
      was measured by the TRP-PCR method. We also offered genetic counseling and 
      prenatal diagnosis to the women carrying pre-mutation or full mutation alleles. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of pre-mutation in reproductive women in northern China 
      was 1/410, higher than that in southern China and Korea but lower than that in 
      western countries. We also found that the prevalence of pre-mutation was 
      relatively high (1/320) in women with abortion history. CONCLUSION: Screening for 
      CGG repeat expansion mutation in FMR1 should be recommended to the women with the 
      history of spontaneous abortion or induced abortion due to delayed growth of the 
      embryos.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Premature ovarian insufficiency is a lack of ovarian functions in 
      patients younger than 40 years old. Genetic causes leading to accelerated 
      follicle depletion may result in premature ovarian insufficiency. We aimed to 
      determine genetic etiology of nonsyndromic premature ovarian insufficiency cases 
      from Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 86 nonsyndromic premature ovarian 
      insufficiency cases and 26 matched control female participants. Participants have 
      been investigated in cytogenetic analysis followed by FMR1 repeat size expansions 
      and search of variants for nine premature ovarian insufficiency-associated genes. 
      RESULTS: Four cases had a structural cytogenetic abnormality. Two cases revealed 
      with premutation size FMR1 triplet repeat expansion. Four cases carried variants 
      in which two were very rare in FSHR and PDPK1, and three were novel in NR5A1, 
      PDPK1, and POF1B genes. Six novel variants have been identified in NOBOX, NR5A1, 
      POF1B, and PDPK1 in control population assigned to be benign alterations. 
      CONCLUSION: Mosaicism of sex chromosomes was responsible in 4.6% and FMR1 
      premutation in 2.4% of premature ovarian insufficiency cases, while the 
      association of premature ovarian insufficiency-related genes was found very 
      subtle. Novel variants in NR5A1, PDPK1, and POF1B may necessitate further 
      evaluation for their association with premature ovarian insufficiency via 
      functional studies.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CGG-repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene on the 
      X-chromosome. Both elevated levels of the expanded FMR1 mRNA and aberrant 
      expression of a polyglycine protein (FMRpolyG) from the CGG-repeat region are 
      hypothesized to trigger the pathogenesis of FXTAS. While increased expression of 
      FMRpolyG leads to higher toxicity in FXTAS models, the pathogenic effect of this 
      protein has only been studied in the presence of CGG-containing mRNA. Here we 
      present a model that allows measurement of the effect of FMRpolyG-expression 
      without co-expression of the corresponding CGG mRNA hairpin. This allows direct 
      comparison of the effect of the FMRpolyG protein per se, vs. that of the FMRpolyG 
      protein together with the CGG mRNA hairpin. Our results show that expression of 
      the FMRpolyG, in the absence of any CGG mRNA, is sufficient to cause reduced cell 
      viability, lamin ring disruption and aggregate formation. Furthermore, we found 
      FMRpolyG to be a long-lived protein degraded primarily by the 
      ubiquitin-proteasome-system. Together, our data indicate that accumulation of 
      FMRpolyG protein per se may play a major role in the development of FXTAS.

LID - 10.1007/978-1-4939-9080-1_3 [doi]
AB  - The vast majority of fragile X affected patients do not transcribe FMR1 due to a 
      CGG repeat expansion in the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. When the 
      CGGs considerably expand, it elicits abnormal DNA methylation and histone 
      modifications, which are responsible for FMR1 transcriptional silencing. In this 
      chapter, we describe in detail two commonly used protocols for monitoring the 
      epigenetic state of the FMR1 gene that bypass the difficulty in directly 
      analyzing the CGGs. One protocol is for accurately measuring DNA methylation 
      levels and the other is for profiling histone modifications.

LID - 10.1007/978-1-4939-9213-3_14 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) CGG repeat expansions cause fragile X 
      syndrome-the leading monogenic form of intellectual disability-and increase the 
      risk for fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome and fragile X-associated 
      primary ovarian insufficiency. Southern blot (SB) analysis is the current gold 
      standard test for FMR1 molecular diagnosis. Several polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR)-based methods are now available for sizing FMR1 CGG repeat expansions. 
      These methods offer higher diagnostic sensitivity and specificity compared to SB 
      analysis, significantly reduce the turnaround time and increase throughput. In 
      this chapter, we describe a triplet-repeat primed PCR protocol that employs 
      capillary electrophoresis to resolve the derived amplicon products, enabling 
      precise determination of the FMR1 genotypes in both males and females and 
      characterization of the CGG repeat structure.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused primarily by a CGG repeat expansion in the 
      FMR1 gene that triggers its transcriptional silencing. In order to investigate 
      the regulatory layers involved in FMR1 inactivation, we tested a collection of 
      chromatin modulators for the ability to reactivate the FMR1 locus. Although 
      inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) induced the highest levels of FMR1 
      expression, a combination of a DNMT inhibitor and another compound potentiated 
      the effect of reactivating treatment. To better assess the rescue effect 
      following direct demethylation, we characterized the long-term and genome-wide 
      effects of FMR1 reactivation and established an in vivo system to analyze 
      FMR1-reactivating therapies. Systemic treatment with a DNMT inhibitor in mice 
      carrying FXS induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived transplants robustly 
      induced FMR1 expression in the affected tissue, which was maintained for a 
      prolonged period of time. Finally, we show a proof of principle for 
      FMR1-reactivating therapy in the context of the CNS.

LID - 10.3390/brainsci9030052 [doi]
LID - 52
AB  - The fragile X-related disorders (FXDs) are a group of clinical conditions that 
      result primarily from an unusual mutation, the expansion of a CGG-repeat tract in 
      exon 1 of the FMR1 gene. Mouse models are proving useful for understanding many 
      aspects of disease pathology in these disorders. There is also reason to think 
      that such models may be useful for understanding the molecular basis of the 
      unusual mutation responsible for these disorders. This review will discuss what 
      has been learnt to date about mechanisms of repeat instability from a knock-in 
      FXD mouse model and what the implications of these findings may be for humans 
      carrying expansion-prone FMR1 alleles.

TI  - Astroglial-targeted expression of the fragile X CGG repeat premutation in mice 
      yields RAN translation, motor deficits and possible evidence for cell-to-cell 
      propagation of FXTAS pathology.

AB  - The fragile X premutation is a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion between 55 and 
      200 repeats in the 5'-untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 
      (FMR1) gene. Human carriers of the premutation allele are at risk of developing 
      the late-onset neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome (FXTAS). Characteristic neuropathology associated with FXTAS includes 
      intranuclear inclusions in neurons and astroglia. Previous studies recapitulated 
      these histopathological features in neurons in a knock-in mouse model, but 
      without significant astroglial pathology. To determine the role of astroglia in 
      FXTAS, we generated a transgenic mouse line (Gfa2-CGG99-eGFP) that selectively 
      expresses a 99-CGG repeat expansion linked to an enhanced green fluorescent 
      protein (eGFP) reporter in astroglia throughout the brain, including cerebellar 
      Bergmann glia. Behaviorally these mice displayed impaired motor performance on 
      the ladder-rung test, but paradoxically better performance on the rotarod. 
      Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that CGG99-eGFP co-localized with GFAP and 
      S-100ss, but not with NeuN, Iba1, or MBP, indicating that CGG99-eGFP expression is 
      specific to astroglia. Ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions were found in 
      eGFP-expressing glia throughout the brain. In addition, intracytoplasmic 
      ubiquitin-positive inclusions were found outside the nucleus in distal astrocyte 
      processes. Intriguingly, intranuclear inclusions, in the absence of eGFP mRNA and 
      eGFP fluorescence, were present in neurons of the hypothalamus and neocortex. 
      Furthermore, intranuclear inclusions in both neurons and astrocytes displayed 
      immunofluorescent labeling for the polyglycine peptide FMRpolyG, implicating 
      FMRpolyG in the pathology found in Gfa2-CGG99 mice. Considered together, these 
      results show that Gfa2-CGG99 expression in mice is sufficient to induce key 
      features of FXTAS pathology, including formation of intranuclear inclusions, 
      translation of FMRpolyG, and deficits in motor function.

AB  - Expansion of a CGG-repeat tract in the 5' UTR of FMR1 is responsible for the 
      Fragile X-related disorders (FXDs), FXTAS, FXPOI and FXS. Previous work in a 
      mouse model of these disorders has implicated proteins in the base excision and 
      the mismatch repair (MMR) pathways in the expansion mechanism. However, the 
      precise role of these factors in this process is not well understood. The 
      essential role of MutLgamma, a complex that plays a minor role in MMR but that is 
      essential for resolving Holliday junctions during meiosis, raises the possibility 
      that expansions proceed via a Holliday junction-like intermediate that is 
      processed to generate a double-strand break (DSB). We show here in an FXD mouse 
      model that LIG4, a ligase essential for non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), a form 
      of DSB repair (DSBR), protects against expansions. However, a mutation in MRE11, 
      a nuclease that is important for several other DSBR pathways including homologous 
      recombination (HR), has no effect on the extent of expansion. Our results suggest 
      that the expansion pathway competes with NHEJ for the processing of a DSB 
      intermediate. Thus, expansion likely proceeds via an NHEJ-independent DSBR 
      pathway that may also be HR-independent.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The etiology of more than half of all patients with X-linked 
      intellectual disability remains elusive, despite array-based comparative genomic 
      hybridization, whole exome or genome sequencing. Since short read massive 
      parallel sequencing approaches do not allow the detection of larger tandem repeat 
      expansions, we hypothesized that such expansions could be a hidden cause of 
      X-linked intellectual disability. METHODS: We selectively captured over 1800 
      tandem repeats on the X chromosome and characterized them by long read single 
      molecule sequencing in 3 families with idiopathic X-linked intellectual 
      disability. RESULTS: In male DNA samples, full tandem repeat length sequences 
      were obtained for 88-93% of the targets and up to 99.6% of the repeats with a 
      moderate guanine-cytosine content. Read length and analysis pipeline allow to 
      detect cases of > 900 bp tandem repeat expansion. In one family, one repeat 
      expansion co-occurs with down-regulation of the neighboring MIR222 gene. This 
      gene has previously been implicated in intellectual disability and is apparently 
      linked to FMR1 and NEFH overexpression associated with neurological disorders. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the power of single molecule sequencing to 
      measure tandem repeat lengths and detect expansions, and suggests that tandem 
      repeat mutations may be a hidden cause of X-linked intellectual disability.

AB  - Recent evidence indicates that specific RNAs promote the formation of 
      ribonucleoprotein condensates by acting as scaffolds for RNA-binding proteins 
      (RBPs). We systematically investigated RNA-RBP interaction networks to understand 
      ribonucleoprotein assembly. We found that highly contacted RNAs are structured, 
      have long UTRs, and contain nucleotide repeat expansions. Among the RNAs with 
      such properties, we identified the FMR1 3' UTR that harbors CGG expansions 
      implicated in fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). We studied 
      FMR1 binding partners in silico and in vitro and prioritized the splicing 
      regulator TRA2A for further characterization. In a FXTAS cellular model, we 
      validated the TRA2A-FMR1 interaction and investigated implications of its 
      sequestration at both transcriptomic and post-transcriptomic levels. We found 
      that TRA2A co-aggregates with FMR1 in a FXTAS mouse model and in post-mortem 
      human samples. Our integrative study identifies key components of 
      ribonucleoprotein aggregates, providing links to neurodegenerative disease and 
      allowing the discovery of therapeutic targets.

AB  - Background: FMR1 CGG trinucleotide repeat hyper-expansions are observed in 99% of 
      individuals with fragile X mental retardation syndrome (FXS). We evaluated the 
      reliability of a rapid single-step gender-neutral molecular screen for FXS when 
      performed on DNA isolated from dried blood spots. Methods: DNA was extracted from 
      dried blood spots of 151 individuals with intellectual disability or autism 
      spectrum disorder, whose FMR1 repeat genotypes are known. Dried blood spots were 
      blinded prior to DNA extraction and analysis by triplet primed PCR (TP-PCR) and 
      melt curve analysis (MCA). All expansion-positive and representative 
      expansion-negative samples were also genotyped by fluorescent TP-PCR and 
      capillary electrophoresis (CE) to confirm repeat expansion status. Results: Three 
      males and 12 females were classified as expanded by TP-PCR MCA, and were 
      subsequently sized by fluorescent TP-PCR CE. Two males and four females carried 
      premutations, while one male and eight females carried full mutations. All 19 
      non-expanded samples that were sized were confirmed as carrying only normal 
      alleles. Replicate analysis of representative expansion-positive samples yielded 
      reproducible melt peak profiles. TP-PCR MCA classifications were completely 
      concordant with FMR1 CGG repeat genotypes. Conclusion: TP-PCR MCA of dried blood 
      spot DNA accurately and reliably identifies presence/absence of FMR1 CGG repeat 
      expansions in both genders simultaneously. This strategy may be suitable for 
      rapid high-throughput first-tier screening for fragile X syndrome.

TI  - The G-rich Repeats in FMR1 and C9orf72 Loci Are Hotspots for Local Unpairing of 
      DNA.
PG  - 1239-1252
LID - 10.1534/genetics.118.301672 [doi]
AB  - Pathological mutations involving noncoding microsatellite repeats are typically 
      located near promoters in CpG islands and are coupled with extensive repeat 
      instability when sufficiently long. What causes these regions to be prone to 
      repeat instability is not fully understood. There is a general consensus that 
      instability results from the induction of unusual structures in the DNA by the 
      repeats as a consequence of mispairing between complementary strands. In 
      addition, there is some evidence that repeat instability is mediated by RNA 
      transcription through the formation of three-stranded nucleic structures composed 
      of persistent DNA:RNA hybrids, concomitant with single-strand DNA displacements 
      (R-loops). Using human embryonic stem cells with wild-type and repeat expanded 
      alleles in the FMR1 (CGGs) and C9orf72 (GGGGCCs) genes, we show that these loci 
      constitute preferential sites (hotspots) for DNA unpairing. When R-loops are 
      formed, DNA unpairing is more extensive, and is coupled with the interruptions of 
      double-strand structures by the nontranscribing (G-rich) DNA strand. These 
      interruptions are likely to reflect unusual structures in the DNA that drive 
      repeat instability when the G-rich repeats considerably expand. Further, we 
      demonstrate that when the CGGs in FMR1 are hyper-methylated and transcriptionally 
      inactive, local DNA unpairing is abolished. Our study thus takes one more step 
      toward the identification of dynamic, unconventional DNA structures across the 
      G-rich repeats at FMR1 and C9orf72 disease-associated loci.

TI  - Infant Temperament in the FMR1 Premutation and Fragile X Syndrome.
PG  - 412-422
LID - 10.1080/15374416.2018.1514613 [doi]
AB  - Although temperament has been studied for decades as a predictor of 
      psychopathology in the general population, examining temperament in neurogenetic 
      groups has unique potential to inform the genetic and biological factors that may 
      confer risk for psychopathology in later development. The present study examined 
      early temperament in two heritable neurogenetic conditions associated with 
      atypical CGG repeat expansions on the FMR1 gene: the FMR1 premutation (FXpm; 
      55-200 repeats) and fragile X syndrome (FXS; > 200 repeats). We focus 
      specifically on the FXpm, as the condition is highly prevalent (1:209-291 female 
      individuals, 1:430-855 male individuals) and has been preliminarily associated 
      with increased risk for pediatric psychopathology, including attention problems, 
      autism, and anxiety. In contrast, FXS is a low-incidence disorder (1:7,143 males, 
      1:11,111 females) often associated with intellectual disability and severe 
      co-occurring psychosocial conditions, particularly in male individuals. Given 
      information on infant clinical phenotypes in the FXpm and FXS is sparse, we aimed 
      to characterize parent-reported infant temperament in infants with the FXpm 
      (n = 22) relative to FXS (n = 24) and controls (n = 24) assessed on 1 to 3 
      occasions each. Temperament in infants with the FXpm largely fell between TD and 
      FXS groups, with trends toward suppressed negative affect in younger 
      participants, similar to lower negative affect previously reported in FXS. The 
      FXS group consistently demonstrated lower negative affect and surgency than TD 
      controls. These data suggest that FMR1 gene mutations are associated with 
      atypical temperament that emerges as early as infancy, particularly among infants 
      with FXS, warranting further study of whether temperament may index emergent 
      clinical risks in these populations.

AB  - The Fragile X-related disorders (FXDs) are Repeat Expansion Diseases resulting 
      from an expansion of a CGG-repeat tract at the 5' end of the FMR1 gene. The 
      mechanism responsible for this unusual mutation is not fully understood. We have 
      previously shown that mismatch repair (MMR) complexes, MSH2/MSH3 (MutSbeta) and 
      MSH2/MSH6 (MutSalpha), together with Polbeta, a DNA polymerase important for base 
      excision repair (BER), are important for expansions in a mouse model of these 
      disorders. Here we show that MLH1/MLH3 (MutLgamma), a protein complex that can act 
      downstream of MutSbeta in MMR, is also required for all germ line and somatic 
      expansions. However, exonuclease I (EXO1), which acts downstream of MutL proteins 
      in MMR, is not required. In fact, a null mutation in Exo1 results in more 
      extensive germ line and somatic expansions than is seen in Exo1+/+ animals. 
      Furthermore, mice homozygous for a point mutation (D173A) in Exo1 that eliminates 
      its nuclease activity but retains its native conformation, shows a level of 
      expansion that is intermediate between Exo1+/+ and Exo1-/- animals. Thus, our 
      data suggests that expansion of the FX repeat in this mouse model occurs via a 
      MutLgamma-dependent, EXO1-independent pathway, with EXO1 protecting against expansion 
      both in a nuclease-dependent and a nuclease-independent manner. Our data thus 
      have implications for the expansion mechanism and add to our understanding of the 
      genetic factors that may be modifiers of expansion risk in humans.

AB  - Dendritic morphology is a critical determinant of neuronal connectivity, and 
      calcium signaling plays a predominant role in shaping dendrites. Altered 
      dendritic morphology and genetic mutations in calcium signaling are both 
      associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). In this study we tested the 
      hypothesis that dendritic arborization and NDD-relevant behavioral phenotypes are 
      altered by human mutations that modulate calcium-dependent signaling pathways 
      implicated in NDDs. The dendritic morphology of pyramidal neurons in CA1 
      hippocampus and somatosensory cortex was quantified in Golgi-stained brain 
      sections from juvenile mice of both sexes expressing either a human 
      gain-of-function mutation in ryanodine receptor 1 (T4826I-RYR1), a human CGG 
      repeat expansion (170-200 CGG repeats) in the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 
      (FMR1 premutation), both mutations (double mutation; DM), or wildtype mice. In 
      hippocampal neurons, increased dendritic arborization was observed in male 
      T4826I-RYR1 and, to a lesser extent, male FMR1 premutation neurons. Dendritic 
      morphology of cortical neurons was altered in both sexes of FMR1 premutation and 
      DM animals with the most pronounced differences seen in DM females. Genotype also 
      impaired behavior, as assessed using the three-chambered social approach test. 
      The most striking lack of sociability was observed in DM male and female mice. In 
      conclusion, mutations that alter the fidelity of calcium signaling enhance 
      dendritic arborization in a brain region- and sex-specific manner and impair 
      social behavior in juvenile mice. The phenotypic outcomes of these mutations 
      likely provide a susceptible biological substrate for additional environmental 
      stressors that converge on calcium signaling to determine individual NDD risk.

AB  - More than 25 inherited human disorders are caused by the unstable expansion of 
      repetitive DNA sequences termed short tandem repeats (STRs). A fundamental 
      unresolved question is why some STRs are susceptible to pathologic expansion, 
      whereas thousands of repeat tracts across the human genome are relatively stable. 
      Here, we discover that nearly all disease-associated STRs (daSTRs) are located at 
      boundaries demarcating 3D chromatin domains. We identify a subset of boundaries 
      with markedly higher CpG island density compared to the rest of the genome. 
      daSTRs specifically localize to ultra-high-density CpG island boundaries, 
      suggesting they might be hotspots for epigenetic misregulation or topological 
      disruption linked to STR expansion. Fragile X syndrome patients exhibit severe 
      boundary disruption in a manner that correlates with local loss of CTCF occupancy 
      and the degree of FMR1 silencing. Our data uncover higher-order chromatin 
      architecture as a new dimension in understanding repeat expansion disorders.

AB  - Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual 
      disability and autism. It results from expansion of a CGG nucleotide repeat in 
      the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of FMR1. Large expansions elicit repeat and 
      promoter hyper-methylation, heterochromatin formation, FMR1 transcriptional 
      silencing and loss of the Fragile X protein, FMRP. Efforts aimed at correcting 
      the sequelae resultant from FMRP loss have thus far proven insufficient, perhaps 
      because of FMRP's pleiotropic functions. As the repeats do not disrupt the FMRP 
      coding sequence, reactivation of endogenous FMR1 gene expression could correct 
      the proximal event in FXS pathogenesis. Here we utilize the Clustered Regularly 
      Interspaced Palindromic Repeats/deficient CRISPR associated protein 9 
      (CRISPR/dCas9) system to selectively re-activate transcription from the silenced 
      FMR1 locus. Fusion of the transcriptional activator VP192 to dCas9 robustly 
      enhances FMR1 transcription and increases FMRP levels when targeted directly to 
      the CGG repeat in human cells. Using a previously uncharacterized FXS human 
      embryonic stem cell (hESC) line which acquires transcriptional silencing with 
      serial passaging, we achieved locus-specific transcriptional re-activation of 
      FMR1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression despite promoter and repeat methylation. 
      However, these changes at the transcript level were not coupled with a 
      significant elevation in FMRP protein expression in FXS cells. These studies 
      demonstrate that directing a transcriptional activator to CGG repeats is 
      sufficient to selectively reactivate FMR1 mRNA expression in Fragile X patient 
      stem cells.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by the maternal expansion of an unstable 
      CGG-repeat tract located in the first exon of the FMR1 gene. Further changes in 
      repeat number occur during embryogenesis resulting in individuals sometimes being 
      highly mosaic. Here we show in a mouse model that, in males, expansions are 
      already present in primary spermatocytes with no additional expansions occurring 
      in later stages of gametogenesis. We also show that, in females, expansion occurs 
      in the post-natal oocyte. Additional expansions and a high frequency of large 
      contractions are seen in two-cell stage embryos. Expansion in oocytes, which are 
      non-dividing, would be consistent with a mechanism involving aberrant DNA repair 
      or recombination rather than a problem with chromosomal replication. Given the 
      difficulty of replicating large CGG-repeat tracts, we speculate that very large 
      expanded alleles may be prone to contract in the mitotically proliferating 
      spermatagonial stem cells in men. However, expanded alleles may not be under such 
      pressure in the non-dividing oocyte. The high degree of both expansions and 
      contractions seen in early embryos may contribute to the high frequency of 
      somatic mosaicism that is observed in humans. Our data thus suggest an 
      explanation for the fact that FXS is exclusively maternally transmitted and lend 
      support to models for repeat expansion that are based on problems arising during 
      DNA repair.

AB  - The Fragile X-related disorders (FXDs) are members of a large group of human 
      neurological or neurodevelopmental conditions known as the Repeat Expansion 
      Diseases. The mutation responsible for all of these diseases is an expansion in 
      the size of a disease-specific tandem repeat tract. However, the underlying cause 
      of this unusual mutation is unknown. Genome-wide association studies have 
      identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vicinity of the FAN1 
      (MIM* 613534) gene that are associated with variations in the age at onset of a 
      number of Repeat Expansion Diseases. FAN1 is a nuclease that has both 5'-3' 
      exonuclease and 5' flap endonuclease activities. Here we show in a model for the 
      FXDs that Fan1(-/-) mice have expansions that, in some tissues including brain, 
      are 2-3 times as extensive as they are in Fan1(+/+) mice. However, no effect of 
      the loss of FAN1 was apparent for germ line expansions. Thus, FAN1 plays an 
      important role in protecting against somatic expansions but is either not 
      involved in protecting against intergenerational repeat expansions or is 
      redundant with other related enzymes. However, since loss of FAN1 results in 
      increased expansions in brain and other somatic tissue, FAN1 polymorphisms may be 
      important disease modifiers in those Repeat Expansion Diseases in which somatic 
      expansion contributes to age at onset or disease severity.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by expanded CGG (CGG(exp)) trinucleotides in 
      the 5'UTR of the FMR1 gene encoding fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). 
      The patients, with the number of the repeats ranging from 55 to 200, show 
      specific manifestation of clinical symptoms that include intention tremor, gait 
      ataxia, cognitive deficits, and brain atrophy. Accumulation of toxic polyglycine 
      (FMRpolyG), a by-product of the CGG(exp) repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) 
      translation, is considered to be one of the main factors triggering 
      neurodegenerative processes in FXTAS patients. Nevertheless, the nature of the 
      FMRpolyG-induced cell damage, especially in the context of its soluble and 
      inclusion-associated forms, is still elusive. Targeting either biosynthesis, 
      cellular stability or aggregation capacity of toxic FMRpolyG could be considered 
      as a potential therapeutic strategy for FXTAS. Therefore, we tested a variety of 
      quantitative methods based on forced expression of genetic constructs carrying 
      CGG(exp) repeats in the context of the FMR1 5'UTR fused to GFP, mCherry or 
      Firefly luciferase gene in or out of frame to the polyglycine encoding sequence. 
      We show that FMRpolyG translation either from native or an AUG-induced start 
      codon as well as the translation yield of the FMRP open reading frame equivalent 
      located downstream of the CGG(exp) element can be effectively estimated using 
      fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry or luciferase assay. We also 
      quantitatively estimated soluble fraction and insoluble form of FMRpolyG 
      aggregated in foci using an electrophoretic separation of cell lysates and 
      fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Importantly, we show that dependent on a 
      fusion tag, FMRpolyG has a different potential for aggregate formation. Our 
      established protocols enable sensitive tracking of FMRP and FMRpolyG quantitative 
      and qualitative changes after treatment with potential therapeutic agents for 
      FXTAS. Furthermore, they can be modified for application to other RAN 
      translation- and aggregation-related diseases.

AB  - Amplification of DNA is required as a mandatory step during library preparation 
      in most targeted sequencing protocols. This can be a critical limitation when 
      targeting regions that are highly repetitive or with extreme guanine-cytosine 
      (GC) content, including repeat expansions associated with human disease. Here, we 
      used an amplification-free protocol for targeted enrichment utilizing the 
      CRISPR/Cas9 system (No-Amp Targeted sequencing) in combination with single 
      molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing for studying repeat elements in the 
      huntingtin (HTT) gene, where an expanded CAG repeat is causative for Huntington 
      disease. We also developed a robust data analysis pipeline for repeat element 
      analysis that is independent of alignment of reads to a reference genome. The 
      method was applied to 11 diagnostic blood samples, and for all 22 alleles the 
      resulting CAG repeat count agreed with previous results based on fragment 
      analysis. The amplification-free protocol also allowed for studying somatic 
      variability of repeat elements in our samples, without the interference of PCR 
      stutter. In summary, with No-Amp Targeted sequencing in combination with our 
      analysis pipeline, we could accurately study repeat elements that are difficult 
      to investigate using PCR-based methods.

TI  - BC RNA Mislocalization in the Fragile X Premutation.
LID - 10.1523/ENEURO.0091-18.2018 [doi]
LID - ENEURO.0091-18.2018
AB  - Fragile X premutation disorder is caused by CGG triplet repeat expansions in the 
      5' untranslated region of FMR1 mRNA. The question of how expanded CGG repeats 
      cause disease is a subject of continuing debate. Our work indicates that 
      CGG-repeat structures compete with regulatory BC1 RNA for access to RNA transport 
      factor hnRNP A2. As a result, BC1 RNA is mislocalized in vivo, as its 
      synapto-dendritic presence is severely diminished in brains of CGG-repeat 
      knock-in animals (a premutation mouse model). Lack of BC1 RNA is known to cause 
      seizure activity and cognitive dysfunction. Our working hypothesis thus predicted 
      that absence, or significantly reduced presence, of BC1 RNA in synapto-dendritic 
      domains of premutation animal neurons would engender cognate phenotypic 
      alterations. Testing this prediction, we established epileptogenic susceptibility 
      and cognitive impairments as major phenotypic abnormalities of CGG premutation 
      mice. In CA3 hippocampal neurons of such animals, synaptic release of glutamate 
      elicits neuronal hyperexcitability in the form of group I metabotropic glutamate 
      receptor-dependent prolonged epileptiform discharges. CGG-repeat knock-in animals 
      are susceptible to sound-induced seizures and are cognitively impaired as 
      revealed in the Attentional Set Shift Task. These phenotypic disturbances occur 
      in young-adult premutation animals, indicating that a neurodevelopmental deficit 
      is an early-initial manifestation of the disorder. The data are consistent with 
      the notion that RNA mislocalization can contribute to pathogenesis.

AB  - The fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by a CGG repeat expansion at the fragile X 
      mental retardation (FMR1) gene. FMR1 alleles with more than 200 CGG repeats bear 
      chromosomal fragility when cells experience folate deficiency. CGG repeats were 
      reported to be able to form secondary structures, such as hairpins, in vitro. 
      When such secondary structures are formed, repeats can lead to replication fork 
      stalling even in the absence of any additional perturbation. Indeed, it was 
      recently shown that the replication forks stall at the endogenous FMR1 locus in 
      unaffected and FXS cells, suggesting the formation of secondary repeat structures 
      at the FMR1 gene in vivo. If not dealt with properly replication fork stalling 
      can lead to polymerase slippage and repeat expansion as well as fragile site 
      expression. Despite the presence of repeat structures at the FMR1 locus, 
      chromosomal fragility is only expressed under replicative stress suggesting the 
      existence of potential molecular mechanisms that help the replication fork 
      progress through these repeat regions. DNA helicases are known to aid replication 
      forks progress through repetitive DNA sequences. Yet, the identity of the DNA 
      helicase(s) responsible for unwinding the CGG repeats at FMR1 locus is not known. 
      We found that the human DNA helicase B (HDHB) may provide an answer for this 
      question. We used chromatin-immunoprecipitation assay to study the FMR1 region 
      and common fragile sites (CFS), and asked whether HDHB localizes at replication 
      forks stalled at repetitive regions even in unperturbed cells. HDHB was strongly 
      enriched in S-phase at the repetitive DNA at CFS and FMR1 gene but not in the 
      flanking regions. Taken together, these results suggest that HDHB functions in 
      preventing or repairing stalled replication forks that arise in repeat-rich 
      regions even in unperturbed cells. Furthermore, we discuss the importance and 
      potential role of HDHB and other helicases in the resolution of secondary CGG 
      repeat structures.

AB  - G(4)C(2) hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene seem to be the 
      cause of numerous cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and/or 
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In this study, we investigated the presence of the 
      G(4)C(2) repeat expansion in 463 Brazilian probands, of whom 404 had ALS/motor 
      neuron disease and 67 FTD, and in 63 healthy controls in the southeastern region 
      of Brazil. The highest frequencies of the C9orf72 mutation were in the ALS-FTD 
      group (50% of familial and 17.6% of sporadic cases), although it was also present 
      in 5% of pure ALS/motor neuron disease patients (11.8% of familial and 3.6% of 
      sporadic cases) and in 7.1% of pure familial FTD. Among G(4)C(2) repeat mutation 
      carriers, 68.8% of the subjects who developed dementia symptoms were females. 
      This frequency was significantly higher than the percentage reached by men with 
      C9orf72 expansion who had this phenotype (p = 0.047). No abnormal repeat 
      expansion was found in control groups. Inclusion of the C9orf72 genetic test in 
      the molecular panels for Brazilian populations with these neurodegenerative 
      diseases should be strongly considered.

TI  - Haplotype Analysis of DXS548 and FRAXAC1 Microsatellite Loci in Iranian Patients 
      with Fragile X Syndrome.
PG  - 36-46
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of inherited mental 
      retardation caused by expansion of a (CGG) repeat region up to 1000 repeat in 5' 
      region of the FMR1 gene located in FRAXA locus Xq27.3. To better understand the 
      mechanism involved in expansion of CGG region, the molecular characteristic of 
      the flanking microsatellite markers in the region must be clarify in different 
      populations. We aimed to examine the potential association between specific 
      haplotype and the expanded AC-repeat region in cases and controls chromosomes. 
      MATERIALS & METHODS: Forty unrelated FXS males and 62 unrelated normal males 
      originating from various regions of Iran were haplotyped by analyzing two 
      CA-repeat markers, FRAXAC1 and DXS548. RESULTS: Significant linkage 
      disequilibrium was obtained between DXS548 and FRAXAC1 specific marker alleles 
      and CGG repeat expansion among 40 fragile X cases compared to 62 normal controls. 
      The frequencies of DXS548 and FRAXAC1 longer alleles in patients were 
      significantly higher than that in control group. Two FRAXAC1 long alleles were 
      only observed in cases, possibly due to concatenated mutations. The increase of 
      heterozygosities in fragile X cases (DXS548 78.6%, FRAXAC1 64.6%) in comparison 
      to the controls (DXS548 63.0%, FRAXAC1 47.0%) showed a multimodal distribution of 
      fragile X associated alleles. CONCLUSION: Haplotype analyses with DXS548 and 
      FRAXAC1 markers represented that haplotype distribution in the normal controls 
      and FXS patients were significantly different, representing a weak founder 
      effect.

TI  - Frequency of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, SCA36, FXTAS and C9orf72 repeat expansions in 
      SCA patients negative for the most common SCA subtypes.
PG  - 3

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) subtypes are often caused by expansions 
      in non-coding regions of genes like SCA8, SCA10, SCA12 and SCA36. Other ataxias 
      are known to be associated with repeat expansions such as fragile X-associated 
      tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) or expansions in the C9orf72 gene. When no 
      mutation has been identified in the aforementioned genes next-generation 
      sequencing (NGS)-based diagnostics may also be applied. In order to define an 
      optimal diagnostic strategy, more information about the frequency and phenotypic 
      characteristics of rare repeat expansion disorders associated with ataxia should 
      be at hand. METHODS: We analyzed a consecutive cohort of 440 German unrelated 
      patients with symptoms of cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria and other unspecific 
      symptoms who were referred to our center for SCA diagnostics. They showed alleles 
      in the normal range for the most common SCA subtypes SCA1-3, SCA6, SCA7 and 
      SCA17. These patients were screened for expansions causing SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA36 and FXTAS as well as for the pathogenic hexanucleotide repeat in the 
      C9orf72 gene. RESULTS: Expanded repeats for SCA10, SCA12 or SCA36 were not 
      identified in the analyzed patients. Five patients showed expanded SCA8 CTA/CTG 
      alleles with 92-129 repeats. One 51-year-old male with unclear dementia symptoms 
      was diagnosed with a large GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72. The analysis of 
      the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) revealed one patient with a 
      premutation (>50 CGG repeats) and seven patients with alleles in the grey zone 
      (41 to 54 CGG repeats). CONCLUSIONS: Altogether five patients showed 92 or more 
      SCA8 CTA/CTG combined repeats. Our results support the assumption that smaller 
      FMR1 gene expansions could be associated with the risk of developing neurological 
      signs. The results do not support genetic testing for C9orf72 expansion in ataxia 
      patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine frequency of fragile X associated premature ovarian 
      insufficiency (FXPOI) among Turkish premutation carriers. STUDY DESIGN: FMR1 
      premutation is the single most common genetic cause of POI (FXPOI). Fragile X 
      Registry at Hacettepe University has been reviewed for the frequency of FXPOI 
      among female premutation carriers. Since 1991 when FMR1 testing was available, 
      760 individuals from 243 families have been registered. Actual data on menstrual 
      status of female premutation carriers were gathered and analysed. RESULTS: Among 
      314 premutation-bearing females in the cohort, 268 could be reached for an update 
      of their menstrual history; 107 adults were 40 or younger and 156 were older than 
      40 years of age, whereas the remaining 5 patients were prepubertal. Among 263 
      postpubertal females with premutations, 90 women stopped menstruating before or 
      at 40 years of age (premature ovarian failure - POF), constituting 34.2% of our 
      cohort. Additionally, one carrier of a gray zone allele experienced FXPOI. 
      History of twinning was present once in 18 women (5.7%) and twice in two women 
      (0.6%), one of the latter interestingly bearing a full-mutation. CONCLUSIONS: 
      FXPOI rates in the present cohort are higher than those reported in other 
      populations. Higher FXPOI rates in Turkish premutation carriers might be a 
      reflection of younger mean menopause age and higher POI rates in otherwise 
      healthy Turkish women. Since POI is much more frequent among premutation carriers 
      than in general population, testing for CGG repeat expansions in FMR1 should be 
      included in the work-up.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability 
      in humans. It is a result of CGG repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region 
      (5' UTR) of the FMR1 gene. This gene encodes the FMRP protein that is involved in 
      neuronal development. Repeat expansion leads to heterochromatinization of the 
      promoter, gene silencing, and the subsequent absence of FMRP. To date, there is 
      no specific therapy for the syndrome. All treatments in clinic practice provide 
      symptomatic therapy. The development of drug therapy for Fragile X syndrome 
      treatment is connected with the search for inhibitors of enzymes that are 
      responsible for heterochromatinization. Here, we report a weak transcriptional 
      activity of the FMR1 gene and the absence of FMRP protein after Fragile X 
      syndrome cell lines treatment with two FDA approved inhibitors of histone 
      deacetylases, romidepsin and vorinostat. We demonstrate that romidepsin, an

TI  - Molecular Characterization of FMR1 Gene by TP-PCR in Women of Reproductive Age 
      and Women with Premature Ovarian Insufficiency.
PG  - 91-100
LID - 10.1007/s40291-017-0305-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome is caused by CGG repeat expansion mutation in the 
      FMR1 gene. Normal alleles have 5-44 CGG repeats with AGG interruptions. The 
      expanded gray zone (GZ) (45-54 repeats) and premutation (PM) (55-200 repeats) 
      alleles are often uninterrupted and are unstably inherited in subsequent 
      generations. The prevalence of PM and GZ carriers is high in the female 
      population, at 1/66 and 1/113, respectively, and PM is associated with fertility 
      problems in 20% of cases. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to molecularly 
      characterize CGG repeats and AGG interruption sequences in the FMR1 gene in women 
      of reproductive age and in women with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted molecular analysis of the FMR1 gene from 300 
      women of reproductive age and 140 women with POI using triplet primed-polymerase 
      chain reaction. This enabled us to identify carriers and to document CGG repeat 
      size and the AGG interruption pattern. RESULTS: In women of reproductive age, 
      1.7% were GZ carriers and 0.3% were PM carriers; in women with POI, 3.6% were GZ 
      carriers and 2.14% were PM carriers. The frequency of GZ and PM carriers did not 
      significantly differ between the cohorts (Fisher's exact test: p < 2.23 for GZ 
      vs. control and p < 0.101 for PM vs. control). Carriers received genetic 
      counselling; family screening identified an additional seven carriers. 
      CONCLUSION: We documented preliminary data on the prevalence of GZ and PM 
      carriers among the studied cohorts. The identification of PM carriers among women 
      with POI serves a dual purpose of recognizing a cause for ovarian dysfunction and 
      enabling genetic counselling, which will help carriers when making reproductive 
      decisions.

TI  - Reduction in the number of CGG repeats on the FMR1 gene in carriers of genetic 
      disorders versus noncarriers.
PG  - 327-329
LID - 10.5935/1518-0557.20170054 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: CGG repeat expansion on the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene 
      is used to diagnose fragile X syndrome. Previous studies have discussed the 
      correlation between the number of CGG repeats and its associated phenotypic 
      components. The objective of this study is to determine whether the number of CGG 
      repeats differ between carriers of genetic disorders versus noncarriers. METHODS: 
      We performed a retrospective chart review of 2867 patients who received genetic 
      screening at our fertility clinic between June 2013 and July 2015. The number of 
      CGG repeats on allele 1 and allele 2 on the FMR1 gene was collected and it was 
      specified whether the patient was a carrier or a noncarrier of a specific 
      mutation. Patients with CGG repeats greater than or equal to 45 were excluded 
      from the study. RESULTS: Carriers (n=759) had a reduced number of repeats 
      compared to noncarriers (n=2024) on allele 1 (p=.03), allele 2 (p=.02) and the 
      average of both alleles (p=.01). Additionally, the number of CGG repeats from the 
      ten most carried diseases from the cohort were used and tested individually for 
      clinical significance against the number of repeats in the noncarriers. A 
      reduction in repeats was shown in several mutations and a few were outliers. 
      CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that there is a significant reduction in the 
      number of CGG repeats in carriers of genetic mutations. A larger scale study of 
      disease carrying patients would be beneficial.

TI  - The effects of optimism, religion, and hope on mood and anxiety disorders in 
      women with the FMR1 premutation.
PG  - 916-927
LID - 10.1111/jir.12409 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The FMR1 premutation, caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      on the FMR1 gene, has been identified as a genetic risk factor for mood and 
      anxiety disorders. Building on recent studies identifying increased risk for mood 
      and affective disorders in this population, we examined effects of potential 
      protective factors (optimism, religion, hope) on depression and anxiety diagnoses 
      in a prospective, longitudinal cohort. METHODS: Eighty-three women with the FMR1 
      premutation participated in the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR 
      Disorders at two-time points, 3 years apart. Participants also completed measures 
      of optimism, religion, personal faith, hope, and child and family 
      characteristics. We used logistic regression to examine correlates of major 
      depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders at the initial assessment, as 
      well as predictors of the diagnostic course over time. RESULTS: Lower optimism 
      and higher religious participation relevant to fragile X syndrome at the initial 
      assessment were associated with a lifetime history of MDD. Lower optimism also 
      predicted the occurrence and reoccurrence of an anxiety disorder 3 years later. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In women with the FMR1 premutation, elevated optimism may reduce the 
      occurrence or severity of MDD and anxiety disorders. These findings underscore 
      the importance of supporting mental health across the FMR1 spectrum of 
      involvement.

TI  - Fragile X Mental Retardation-1 Knockout Zebrafish Shows Precocious Development in 
      Social Behavior.
PG  - 438-443
LID - 10.1089/zeb.2017.1446 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a generally hereditary form of human mental 
      retardation that is caused by triplet repeat expansion (CGG) mutation in fragile 
      X mental retardation 1 (fmr1) gene promoter and that results in the absence of 
      the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression. The common symptoms 
      of FXS patients include learning disabilities, anxiety, autistic behaviors, as 
      well as other behavioral abnormalities. Our previous results demonstrated the 
      behavioral abnormalities in fmr1 knockout (KO) zebrafish such as fear memory 
      impairment and autism-like behavior. Here, we studied the functional role of fmr1 
      gene on the development of social behavior by behavioral experiments, including 
      shoaling behavior, shoaling preference, light/dark test, and novel tank task. Our 
      results demonstrated that precocious development of shoaling behavior is found in 
      fmr1 KO zebrafish without affecting the shoaling preference on conspecific 
      zebrafish. The shoaling behavior appeared after 14 days postfertilization (dpf), 
      and the level of shoaling elevated in fmr1 KO zebrafish. Furthermore, the fmr1 KO 
      zebrafish at 28 dpf expressed higher anxiety level in novel tank task. These 
      results suggest that the change of shoaling behavior in fmr1 KO zebrafish may 
      result from hyperactivity and an increase of anxiety.

PG  - 2795-2797
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.38384 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual 
      disability (ID) and autism. In most of cases, the molecular basis of this 
      syndrome is a CGG repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 
      gene. It is inherited as an X linked dominant trait, with a reduced penetrance 
      (80% for males and 30% for females). Full mutation (FM) expansion from premutated 
      alleles (PM) is only acquired via maternal meiosis, while paternal transmission 
      always remains in the PM range. We present a 16-year-old girl with a mild fragile 
      X syndrome phenotype. FMR1 gene study showed that the patient inherited a mosaic 
      premutation-full mutation with an unmethylated uninterrupted allele (175, >200 
      CGG) from her father. The father showed an 88 CGG uninterrupted unmethylated 
      allele in blood and sperm cells. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a 
      FMR1 mosaic premutation-full mutation allele inherited from a PM father. In our 
      opinion, the most likely explanation could be a postzygotic somatic expansion. We 
      can conclude that in rare cases of a child with a full mutation whose mother does 
      not carry a premutation, the possibility of paternal transmission should be 
      considered.

TI  - Prevalence of Fragile X Syndrome among children receiving special education and 
      carrier states in first degree relatives.
PG  - 92-96
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetically determined developmental 
      disorder. Underlying genotype is cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeat expansions 
      with over 200 repeats in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Children 
      with FXS are most accessible in special education institutions in Sri Lanka, with 
      a total of approximately 6000 registered attendees. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the 
      current study was to estimate the prevalence of FXS among special school 
      attendees and to screen first degree relatives of affected children. METHODS: A 
      nationally representative sample of 850 children (5-18 years) was selected using 
      multi-level stratified sampling. Screening was performed by 3' direct triplet 
      primed PCR, followed by melting curve analysis. Expanded repeat status of the 
      screened positives were confirmed using capillary electrophoresis, methylation 
      specific PCR and Southern hybridization. Screening of available first degree 
      relatives (n=12) were carried out using the same method of screening and 
      diagnosis. RESULTS: Eleven had FXS. Prevalence of FXS was 1.3% (95% CI 0.9-1.6). 
      Among the 11 with FXS 9 had more than 350 CGG repeats, while the rest had around 
      300. Twelve first degree relatives consisting of nine mothers, two female 
      siblings and a male sibling were tested. All mothers and female siblings had 
      either full mutation or premutation while the male sibling had CGG repeats in the 
      normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Among the special school attendees, prevalence of FXS 
      was 1.3% which has a high risk for autism and attention deficit hyperactivity 
      disorder.

TI  - Metformin ameliorates core deficits in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 674-677
LID - 10.1038/nm.4335 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum 
      disorders (ASD). Trinucleotide repeat expansions in FMR1 abolish FMRP expression, 
      leading to hyperactivation of ERK and mTOR signaling upstream of mRNA 
      translation. Here we show that metformin, the most widely used drug for type 2 
      diabetes, rescues core phenotypes in Fmr1(-/y) mice and selectively normalizes 
      ERK signaling, eIF4E phosphorylation and the expression of MMP-9. Thus, metformin 
      is a potential FXS therapeutic.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder typically affecting male premutation carriers with 
      55-200 CGG trinucleotide repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene after age 50. The aim 
      of this study was to examine whether cerebellar and brainstem changes emerge 
      during development or aging in late life. We retrospectively analyzed magnetic 
      resonance imaging scans from 322 males (age 8-81 years). Volume changes in the 
      cerebellum and brainstem were contrasted with those in the ventricles and whole 
      brain. Compared to the controls, premutation carriers without FXTAS showed 
      significantly accelerated volume decrease in the cerebellum and whole brain, 
      flatter inverted U-shaped trajectory of the brainstem, and larger ventricles. 
      Compared to both older controls and premutation carriers without FXTAS, carriers 
      with FXTAS exhibited significant volume decrease in the cerebellum and whole 
      brain and accelerated volume decrease in the brainstem. We therefore conclude 
      that cerebellar and brainstem volumes were likely affected during both 
      development and progression of neurodegeneration in premutation carriers, 
      suggesting that interventions may need to start early in adulthood to be most 
      effective.

TI  - Selective rescue of heightened anxiety but not gait ataxia in a premutation 90CGG 
      mouse model of Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome.
PG  - 2133-2145
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddx108 [doi]
AB  - A CGG-repeat expansion in the premutation range in the Fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 gene (FMR1) has been identified as the genetic cause of Fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late-onset neurodegenerative 
      disorder that manifests with action tremor, gait ataxia and cognitive 
      impairments. In this study, we used a bigenic mouse model, in which expression of 
      a 90CGG premutation tract is activated in neural cells upon doxycycline 
      administration-P90CGG mouse model. We, here, demonstrate the behavioural 
      manifestation of clinically relevant features of FXTAS patients and premutation 
      carrier individuals in this inducible mouse model. P90CGG mice display heightened 
      anxiety, deficits in motor coordination and impaired gait and represent the first 
      FXTAS model that exhibits an ataxia phenotype as observed in patients. The 
      behavioural phenotype is accompanied by the formation of 
      ubiquitin/FMRpolyglycine-positive intranuclear inclusions, as another hallmark of 
      FXTAS, in the cerebellum, hippocampus and amygdala. Strikingly, upon cessation of 
      transgene induction the anxiety phenotype of mice recovers along with a reduction 
      of intranuclear inclusions in dentate gyrus and amygdala. In contrast, motor 
      function deteriorates further and no reduction in intranuclear inclusions can be 
      observed in the cerebellum. Our data thus demonstrate that expression of a 90CGG 
      premutation expansion outside of the FMR1 context is sufficient to evoke an 
      FXTAS-like behavioural phenotype. Brain region-specific neuropathology and 
      (partial) behavioural reversibility make the inducible P90CGG a valuable mouse 
      model for testing pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic intervention methods.

AB  - In the present study, we evaluated a commercially available TP-PCR-based assay, 
      the FastFraXTM FMR1 Sizing kit, as a test in quantifying the number of CGG 
      repeats in the FMR1 gene. Based on testing with well characterized DNA samples 
      from Coriell, the kit yielded size results within 3 repeats of those obtained by 
      common consensus (n = 14), with the exception of one allele. Furthermore, based 
      on data obtained using all Coriell samples with or without common consensus (n = 
      29), the Sizing kit was 97.5% in agreement with existing approaches. 
      Additionally, the kit generated consistent size information in repeatability and 
      reproducibility studies (CV 0.39% to 3.42%). Clinical performance was established 
      with 198 archived clinical samples, yielding results of 100% sensitivity (95% CI, 
      91.03% to 100%) and 100% specificity (95% CI, 97.64% to 100%) in categorizing 
      patient samples into the respective normal, intermediate, premutation and full 
      mutation genotypes.

TI  - Iron accumulation and dysregulation in the putamen in fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome.
PG  - 585-591
LID - 10.1002/mds.26902 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome is an adult-onset 
      disorder associated with premutation alleles of the FMR1 gene. This disorder is 
      characterized by progressive action tremor, gait ataxia, and cognitive decline. 
      Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome pathology includes dystrophic white 
      matter and intranuclear inclusions in neurons and astrocytes. We previously 
      demonstrated that the transport of iron into the brain is altered in fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome; therefore, we also expect an alteration of 
      iron metabolism in brain areas related to motor control. Iron is essential for 
      cell metabolism, but uncomplexed iron leads to oxidative stress and contributes 
      to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated a potential 
      iron modification in the putamen - a structure that participates in motor 
      learning and performance - in fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. 
      METHODS: We used samples of putamen obtained from 9 fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome and 9 control cases to study iron localization using 
      Perl's method, and iron-binding proteins using immunostaining. RESULTS: We found 
      increased iron deposition in neuronal and glial cells in the putamen in fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. We also found a generalized decrease in the 
      amount of the iron-binding proteins transferrin and ceruloplasmin, and decreased 
      number of neurons and glial cells that contained ceruloplasmin. However, we found 
      increased levels of iron, transferrin, and ceruloplasmin in microglial cells, 
      indicating an attempt by the immune system to remove the excess iron. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Overall, found a deficit in proteins that eliminate extra iron from 
      the cells with a concomitant increase in the deposit of cellular iron in the 
      putamen in Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. (c) 2017 International

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from a repeat expansion mutation near the FMR1 
      gene promoter and is the most common form of heritable intellectual disability 
      and autism. Full mutations larger than 200 CGG repeats trigger FMR1 
      heterochromatinization and loss of gene expression, which is primarily 
      responsible for the pathological features of FXS . In contrast, smaller 
      pre-mutations of 55-200 CGG are associated with FMR1 overexpression and Fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late-onset neurodegenerative 
      condition. While the role of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in FMR1 gene silencing has 
      been studied extensively, the role of 5-hydroxymethylation (5hmC), a newly 
      discovered epigenetic mark produced through active DNA demethylation, has not 
      been previously investigated in FXS neurons. Here, we used two complementary 
      epigenetic assays, 5hmC sensitive restriction digest and ten-eleven 
      translocation-assisted bisulfite pyrosequencing, to quantify FMR1 5mC and 5hmC 
      levels. We observed increased levels of 5hmC at the FMR1 promoter in FXS patient 
      brains with full-mutations relative to pre-mutation carriers and unaffected 
      controls. In addition, we found that 5hmC enrichment at the FMR1 locus in FXS 
      cells is specific to neurons by utilizing a nuclei sorting technique to separate 
      neuronal and glial DNA fractions from post-mortem brain tissues. This FMR1 5hmC 
      enrichment was not present in cellular models of FXS including fibroblasts, 
      lymphocytes and reprogrammed neurons, indicating they do not fully recapitulate 
      this epigenetic feature of disease. Future studies could investigate the 
      potential to leverage this epigenetic pathway to restore FMR1 expression and 
      discern whether levels of 5hmC correlate with phenotypic severity.

AB  - CGG repeats in the 5'UTR of Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) RNA mediate RNA 
      localization and translation in granules. Large expansions of CGG repeats (> 200 
      repeats) in FMR1, referred to as full mutations, are associated with fragile X 
      syndrome (FXS). Smaller expansions (55-200 repeats), referred to as premutations, 
      are associated with fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and fragile X 
      premature ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). TMPyP4 is a porphyrin ring compound that 
      destabilizes CGG repeat RNA secondary structure. Here we show that exogenous CGG 
      repeat RNA by itself, lacking the FMRP ORF, microinjected into hippocampal 
      neurons is localized in RNA granules and inhibits translation of ARC RNA, which 
      is localized in the same granules. TMPyP4 rescues translation of ARC RNA in 
      granules. We also show that in human premutation fibroblasts with endogenous CGG 
      repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene, translation of ARC RNA is inhibited and 
      calcium homeostasis is disrupted and both phenotypes are rescued by TMPyP4. 
      Inhibition of granule translation by expanded CGG repeats and rescue of granule 
      translation by TMPy4, represent potential pathogenic mechanism and therapeutic 
      strategy, respectively, for FXTAS and FXPOI.

      developing fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome or fragile X-associated 
      primary ovarian insufficiency. Furthermore, the premutation allele often expands 
      to a full mutation during female germline transmission giving rise to the fragile 
      X syndrome. The risk for a premutation to expand depends mainly on the number of 
      CGG units and the presence of AGG interruptions in the CGG repeat. Unfortunately, 
      the detection of AGG interruptions is hampered by technical difficulties. Here, 
      we demonstrate that single-molecule sequencing enables the determination of not 
      only the repeat size, but also the complete repeat sequence including AGG 
      interruptions in male and female alleles with repeats ranging from 45 to 100 CGG 
      units. We envision this method will facilitate research and diagnostic analysis 
      of the FMR1 repeat expansion.

TI  - Molecular screening of intellectually disabled patients and those with premature 
      ovarian failure for CGG repeat expansion at FMR1 locus: Implication of combined

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is also a leading cause of intellectual 
      disability along with Down's syndrome. It is caused by the expansion of CGG 
      triplet repeat at 5' untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 
      (FMR1) gene. Since the prevalence rate is quite high in the general population, 
      molecular diagnosis is important to establish the cause and the prenatal 
      diagnosis. At present, there are a number of methods available with their own 
      merits and demerits. AIM AND METHODS: Molecular screening of intellectually 
      disabled patients and those with premature ovarian failure with combined triplet 
      repeat primed polymerase chain reaction (TP-PCR) and methylation-specific 
      polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) for establishing the diagnosis of FXS. 
      RESULTS: The specificity of the method has been validated with archived 
      previously genotyped samples, facilitating the application of this method in the 
      screening procedure. The combined TP-PCR and MS-PCR approach identified six (10%) 
      of the intellectually disabled cases as full mutation positive, one (4%) of the 
      premature ovarian failure cases as premutation positive, and one (out of two) of 
      the prenatal samples as premutation positive. CONCLUSION: The present study 
      concludes that a combined usage of TP-PCR and MS-PCR will be a useful alternative 
      approach to diagnose patients suffering from fragile X syndrome.

TI  - CGG Repeat-Induced FMR1 Silencing Depends on the Expansion Size in Human iPSCs 
      and Neurons Carrying Unmethylated Full Mutations.

AB  - In fragile X syndrome (FXS), CGG repeat expansion greater than 200 triplets is 
      believed to trigger FMR1 gene silencing and disease etiology. However, FXS 
      siblings have been identified with more than 200 CGGs, termed unmethylated full 
      mutation (UFM) carriers, without gene silencing and disease symptoms. Here, we 
      show that hypomethylation of the FMR1 promoter is maintained in induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from two UFM individuals. However, a 
      subset of iPSC clones with large CGG expansions carries silenced FMR1. 
      Furthermore, we demonstrate de novo silencing upon expansion of the CGG repeat 
      size. FMR1 does not undergo silencing during neuronal differentiation of UFM 
      iPSCs, and expression of large unmethylated CGG repeats has phenotypic 
      consequences resulting in neurodegenerative features. Our data suggest that UFM 
      individuals do not lack the cell-intrinsic ability to silence FMR1 and that 
      inter-individual variability in the CGG repeat size required for silencing exists 
      in the FXS population.

TI  - Contraction of fully expanded FMR1 alleles to the normal range: predisposing 
      haplotype or rare events?
PG  - 269-275
LID - 10.1038/jhg.2016.122 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of inherited intellectual 
      disability, is due to the expansion over 200 CGGs and methylation of this 
      polymorphic region, in the 5'-UTR (untranslated region) of FMR1 (Xq27.3). We have 
      identified four FXS mosaic males: M1-(CGG)(35)/(CGG)(>200); 
      M2-(CGG)(26)/(CGG)(>200); M3-(CGG)(39)/(CGG)(>200); and 
      M4-(CGG)(18)/(CGG)(125)/(CGG)(>200). After genotyping their respective mothers, 
      we suggested that normal alleles of these patients resulted from post-zygotic 
      contractions of full expansions. The detection of these four rare independent 
      cases led us to hypothesize the existence of a large-contraction predisposing 
      haplotype in our population. Next, we questioned whether other normal pure CGGs 
      would have arisen through similar contractions from fully expanded alleles. To 
      address these questions, we identified stable single-nucleotide polymorphism 
      (SNP) lineages and related short tandem repeat (STR) haplotypes 
      (DXS998-DXS548-FRAXAC1-FRAXAC2) of the four mosaics, 123 unrelated FXS patients 
      and 212 controls. An extended flanking haplotype (34-44-38-336) shared by mosaics 
      from lineage A suggested a risk lineage-specific haplotype more prone to large 
      contractions. Other normal pure FMR1 alleles from this SNP background also shared 
      phylogenetically close STR haplotypes, although a single (CGG)(exp)>(CGG)(24) 
      contraction or the loss of AGG interruptions may explain their origin. In both 
      scenarios, multistep FMR1 mutations involving the gain or loss of several CGGs 
      seem to underlie the evolution of the repeat.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common cause of intellectual disability that is 
      most often due to a CGG-repeat expansion mutation in the FMR1 gene that triggers 
      epigenetic gene silencing. Epigenetic modifying drugs can only transiently and 
      modestly induce FMR1 reactivation in the presence of the elongated CGG repeat. As 
      a proof-of-principle, we excised the expanded CGG-repeat in both somatic cell 
      hybrids containing the human fragile X chromosome and human FXS iPS cells using 
      the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. We observed transcriptional reactivation in 
      approximately 67% of the CRISPR cut hybrid colonies and in 20% of isolated human 
      FXS iPSC colonies. The reactivated cells produced FMRP and exhibited a decline in 
      DNA methylation at the FMR1 locus. These data demonstrate the excision of the 
      expanded CGG-repeat from the fragile X chromosome can result in FMR1 
      reactivation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation drives production of toxic 
      proteins from pathogenic repeat sequences in multiple untreatable 
      neurodegenerative disorders. Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) 
      is one such condition, resulting from a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 
      5' leader sequence of the FMR1 gene. RAN proteins from the CGG repeat accumulate 
      in ubiquitinated inclusions in FXTAS patient brains and elicit toxicity. In 
      addition to the CGG repeat, an antisense mRNA containing a CCG repeat is also 
      transcribed from the FMR1 locus. We evaluated whether this antisense CCG repeat 
      supports RAN translation and contributes to pathology in FXTAS patients. METHODS: 
      We generated a series of CCG RAN translation-specific reporters and utilized them 
      to measure RAN translation from CCG repeats in multiple reading frames in 
      transfected cells. We also developed antibodies against predicted CCG RAN 
      proteins and used immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence on FXTAS patient 
      tissues to measure their accumulation and distribution. RESULTS: RAN translation 
      from CCG repeats is supported in all 3 potential reading frames, generating 
      polyproline, polyarginine, and polyalanine proteins, respectively. Their 
      production occurs whether or not the natural AUG start upstream of the repeat in 
      the proline reading frame is present. All 3 frames show greater translation at 
      larger repeat sizes. Antibodies targeted to the antisense FMR polyproline and 
      polyalanine proteins selectively stain nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates in 
      FXTAS patients and colocalize with ubiquitinated neuronal inclusions. 
      INTERPRETATION: RAN translation from antisense CCG repeats generates novel 
      proteins that accumulate in ubiquitinated inclusions in FXTAS patients. Ann 
      Neurol 2016;80:871-881.

TI  - CGG-repeat dynamics and FMR1 gene silencing in fragile X syndrome stem cells and 
      stem cell-derived neurons.
PG  - 42
LID - 42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a common cause of intellectual disability 
      and autism, results from the expansion of a CGG-repeat tract in the 5' 
      untranslated region of the FMR1 gene to >200 repeats. Such expanded alleles, 
      known as full mutation (FM) alleles, are epigenetically silenced in 
      differentiated cells thus resulting in the loss of FMRP, a protein important for 
      learning and memory. The timing of repeat expansion and FMR1 gene silencing is 
      controversial. METHODS: We monitored the repeat size and methylation status of 
      FMR1 alleles with expanded CGG repeats in patient-derived induced pluripotent 
      stem cells (iPSCs) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that were grown for extended 
      period of time either as stem cells or differentiated into neurons. We used a PCR 
      assay optimized for the amplification of large CGG repeats for sizing, and a 
      quantitative methylation-specific PCR for the analysis of FMR1 promoter 
      methylation. The FMR1 mRNA levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR. FMRP levels were 
      determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence. Chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation was used to study the association of repressive histone marks 
      with the FMR1 gene in FXS ESCs. RESULTS: We show here that while FMR1 gene 
      silencing can be seen in FXS embryonic stem cells (ESCs), some silenced alleles 
      contract and when the repeat number drops below ~400, DNA methylation erodes, 
      even when the repeat number remains >200. The resultant active alleles do not 
      show the large step-wise expansions seen in stem cells from other repeat 
      expansion diseases. Furthermore, there may be selection against large active 
      alleles and these alleles do not expand further or become silenced on neuronal 
      differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypotheses that (i) large 
      expansions occur prezygotically or in the very early embryo, (ii) large 
      unmethylated alleles may be deleterious in stem cells, (iii) methylation can 
      occur on alleles with >400 repeats very early in embryogenesis, and (iv) 
      expansion and contraction may occur by different mechanisms. Our data also 
      suggest that the threshold for stable methylation of FM alleles may be higher 
      than previously thought. A higher threshold might explain why some carriers of FM 
      alleles escape methylation. It may also provide a simple explanation for why 
      silencing has not been observed in mouse models with >200 repeats.

TI  - Partially methylated alleles, microdeletion, and tissue mosaicism in a fragile X 
      male with tremor and ataxia at 30 years of age: A case report.
PG  - 3327-3332
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.37954 [doi]
AB  - CGG repeat expansion >200 within FMR1, termed full mutation (FM), has been 
      associated with promoter methylation, consequent silencing of gene expression and 
      fragile X syndrome (FXS)-a common cause of intellectual disability and co-morbid 
      autism. Unmethylated premutation (55-199 repeats) and FM alleles have been 
      associated with fragile X related tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder. Here we present a 33-year-old male with FXS, with 
      white matter changes and progressive deterioration in gait with cerebellar signs 
      consistent with probable FXTAS; there was no evidence of any other cerebellar 
      pathology. We show that he has tissue mosaicism in blood, saliva, and buccal 
      samples for the size and methylation of his expanded alleles and a de novo, 
      unmethylated microdeletion. This microdeletion involves a  approximately 80 bp sequence in the 
      FMR1 promoter as well as complete loss of the CGG repeat in a proportion of 
      cells. Despite FMR1 mRNA levels in blood within the normal range, the methylation 
      and CGG sizing results are consistent with the diagnosis of concurrent FXS and 
      probable FXTAS. The demonstrated presence of unmethylated FM alleles would 
      explain the manifestation of milder than expected cognitive and behavioral 
      impairments and early onset of cerebellar ataxia. Our case suggests that 
      individuals with FXS, who manifest symptoms of FXTAS, may benefit from more 
      detailed laboratory testing. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Male carriers of an expansion of CGG alleles (with 55-200 CGG repeats) in the 
      FMR1 gene are affected with Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). 
      On the other hand, individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) or Parkinsonism 
      spectrum disorders may have some clinical features that overlap with FXTAS. To 
      investigate the possible association between PD and FMR1 expanded alleles, we 
      screened a total of 154 male PD patients and 190 gender- and age-matched healthy 
      control subjects from Iran. Eleven intermediate allele carriers (7.14 %) were 
      detected among PD patients, compared with three carriers (1.57 %) among the 
      controls (P = 0.01). No pre-mutation carriers were identified. Our results 
      indicate that there is a potential association between FMR1 intermediate expanded 
      alleles and PD.

TI  - Group Testing Approach for Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion Disorder Screening.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS, OMIM #300624) is an X-linked condition 
      caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 5' UTR (untranslated region) of 
      the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. FXS testing is commonly performed 
      in expanded carrier screening and has been proposed for inclusion in newborn 
      screening. However, because pathogenic alleles are long and have low complexity 
      (>200 CGG repeats), FXS is currently tested by a single-plex 
      electrophoresis-resolved PCR assay rather than multiplexed approaches like 
      next-generation sequencing or mass spectrometry. In this work, we sought an 
      experimental design based on nonadaptive group testing that could accurately and 
      reliably identify the size of abnormally expanded FMR1 alleles of males and 
      females. METHODS: We developed a new group testing scheme named StairCase (SC) 
      that was designed to the constraints of the FXS testing problem, and compared its 
      performance to existing group testing schemes by simulation. We experimentally 
      evaluated SC's performance on 210 samples from the Coriell Institute 
      biorepositories using pooled PCR followed by capillary electrophoresis on 3 
      replicates of each of 3 pooling layouts differing by the mapping of samples to 
      pools. RESULTS: The SC pooled PCR approach demonstrated perfect classification of 
      samples by clinical category (normal, intermediate, premutation, or full 
      mutation) for 90 positives and 1800 negatives, with a batch of 210 samples 
      requiring only 21 assays. CONCLUSIONS: Group testing based on SC is an 
      implementable approach to trinucleotide repeat expansion disorder testing that 
      offers >/=10-fold reduction in assay costs over current single-plex methods.

TI  - A MutSbeta-Dependent Contribution of MutSalpha to Repeat Expansions in Fragile X 
      Premutation Mice?
PG  - e1006190

LID - e1006190
AB  - The fragile X-related disorders result from expansion of a CGG/CCG microsatellite 
      in the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene. We have previously demonstrated that the 
      MSH2/MSH3 complex, MutSbeta, that is important for mismatch repair, is essential for 
      almost all expansions in a mouse model of these disorders. Here we show that the 
      MSH2/MSH6 complex, MutSalpha also contributes to the production of both germ line and 
      somatic expansions as evidenced by the reduction in the number of expansions 
      observed in Msh6-/- mice. This effect is not mediated via an indirect effect of 
      the loss of MSH6 on the level of MSH3. However, since MutSbeta is required for 98% 
      of germ line expansions and almost all somatic ones, MutSalpha is apparently not able 
      to efficiently substitute for MutSbeta in the expansion process. Using purified 
      human proteins we demonstrate that MutSalpha, like MutSbeta, binds to substrates with 
      loop-outs of the repeats and increases the thermal stability of the structures 
      that they form. We also show that MutSalpha facilitates binding of MutSbeta to these 
      loop-outs. These data suggest possible models for the contribution of MutSalpha to 
      repeat expansion. In addition, we show that unlike MutSbeta, MutSalpha may also act to 
      protect against repeat contractions in the Fmr1 gene.

AB  - Population-based screening for CGG-repeat expansions in the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) gene that cause fragile X syndrome can now be performed more 
      cost-effectively and simply by combining direct triplet-primed PCR (dTP-PCR) with 
      melting curve analysis (MCA). We have now performed a detailed technical 
      validation to define the operational parameters for achieving robust and reliable 
      performance of the FMR1 dTP-PCR MCA assay. We compared the assay's performance on 
      2 real-time PCR platforms and determined its analytic sensitivity and 
      specificity. We also assessed the assay's performance on DNA isolated from 
      different sources, the effect of differences in CGG-repeat length and 
      AGG-interruption pattern on melt peak temperature (Tm), and the effect of common 
      substances found in DNA solutions on Tms. The assay performed well in 
      distinguishing normal from expansion-carrying samples. The assay had detection 
      sensitivity down to 1 ng and an analytical specificity beyond 150 ng. In addition 
      to peripheral blood DNA, analysis could also be performed on DNA from saliva, 
      buccal swabs, and dried blood spots. Salt increased Tms, glycogen contamination 
      had minimal effect, whereas AGG interruptions lowered Tms. The FMR1 dTP-PCR MCA 
      screening assay is highly sensitive and specific, performs well using DNA from 
      different sources, and is robust and reproducible when reagent concentrations are 
      maintained across all tested samples.

TI  - Clinical Phenotype of Adult Fragile X Gray Zone Allele Carriers: a Case Series.
PG  - 623-31
LID - 10.1007/s12311-016-0809-6 [doi]
AB  - Considerable research has focused on patients with trinucleotide (CGG) repeat 
      expansions in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene that fall within 
      either the full mutation (>200 repeats) or premutation range (55-200 repeats). 
      Recent interest in individuals with gray zone expansions (41-54 CGG repeats) has 
      grown due to reported phenotypes that are similar to those observed in 
      premutation carriers, including neurological, molecular, and cognitive signs. The 
      purpose of this manuscript is to describe a series of adults with FMR1 alleles in 
      the gray zone presenting with movement disorders or memory loss. Gray zone 
      carriers ascertained in large FMR1 screening studies were identified and their 
      clinical phenotypes studied. Thirty-one gray zone allele carriers were included, 
      with mean age of symptom onset of 53 years in patients with movement disorders 
      and 57 years in those with memory loss. Four patients were chosen for 
      illustrative case reports and had the following diagnoses: early-onset Parkinson 
      disease (PD), atypical parkinsonism, dementia, and atypical essential tremor. 
      Some gray zone carriers presenting with parkinsonism had typical features, 
      including bradykinesia, rigidity, and a positive response to dopaminergic 
      medication. These patients had a higher prevalence of peripheral neuropathy and 
      psychiatric complaints than would be expected. The patients seen in memory 
      clinics had standard presentations of cognitive impairment with no apparent 
      differences. Further studies are necessary to determine the associations between 
      FMR1 expansions in the gray zone and various phenotypes of neurological 
      dysfunction.

TI  - Warburg effect linked to cognitive-executive deficits in FMR1 premutation.
PG  - 3334-3351
AB  - A 55-200 CGG repeat expansion in the 5'-UTR of the fragile X mental retardation 1 
      (FMR1) gene is known as a premutation. Some carriers are affected by the 
      neurodegenerative disorder fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), 
      primary ovarian insufficiency, and neurobehavioral impairments. Based on the 
      mitochondrial dysfunction observed in fibroblasts and brain samples from 
      carriers, as well as in neurons and brains from a mouse model of the premutation, 
      we evaluated the presence of the Warburg effect in peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells (PBMCs) from 30 premutation carriers with either a rebalance of the 
      metabolism [increasing glycolysis while decreasing oxidative phosphorylation 
      (oxphos)] or a metabolic amplification (increasing glycolysis while 
      maintaining/increasing oxphos). Deficits in oxphos-more pronounced in 
      FXTAS-affected subjects-were accompanied by a shift toward glycolysis, suggesting 
      increased glycolysis despite aerobic conditions. Differential proteomics extended 
      these findings, unveiling a decreased antioxidant response, translation, and 
      disrupted extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton organization with activation of 
      prosenescence pathways. Lower bioenergetics segregated with increased incidence 
      of low executive function, tremors, below-average IQ, and FXTAS. The combination 
      of functional and proteomic data unveiled new mechanisms related to energy 
      production in the premutation, showing the potential of being applicable to other 
      psychiatric disorders to identify endophenotype-specific responses relevant to 
      neurobiology.-Napoli, E., Song, G., Schneider, A., Hagerman, R., Eldeeb, M. A. A.

AB  - Repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation produces toxic polypeptides from 
      nucleotide repeat expansions in the absence of an AUG start codon and contributes 
      to neurodegenerative disorders such as ALS and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome. How RAN translation occurs is unknown. Here we define the critical 
      sequence and initiation factors that mediate CGG repeat RAN translation in the 5' 
      leader of fragile X mRNA, FMR1. Our results reveal that CGG RAN translation is 
      30%-40% as efficient as AUG-initiated translation, is m(7)G cap and eIF4E 
      dependent, requires the eIF4A helicase, and is strongly influenced by repeat 
      length. However, it displays a dichotomous requirement for initiation site 
      selection between reading frames, with initiation in the +1 frame, but not the +2 
      frame, occurring at near-cognate start codons upstream of the repeat. These data 
      support a model in which RAN translation at CGG repeats uses cap-dependent 
      ribosomal scanning, yet bypasses normal requirements for start codon selection.

AB  - Triplet repeat expansions in the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene cause 
      either intellectual disability and autism, or adult-onset neurodegeneration, with 
      poorly understood variability in presentation. Previous studies have identified 
      several long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) at the FMR1 locus, including FMR4. 
      Similarly to FMR1, FMR4 is silenced by large-repeat expansions that result in 
      enrichment of DNA and histone methylation within the shared promoter and repeat 
      sequence, suggesting a possible role for this noncoding RNA in the 
      pathophysiology of Fragile X. We therefore assessed the functional role of FMR4 
      to gain further insight into the molecular processes in Fragile X-associated 
      disorders. Previous work showed that FMR4 does not exhibit cis-regulation of 
      FMR1. Here, we found that FMR4 is a chromatin-associated transcript and, using 
      genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, showed that FMR4 alters 
      the chromatin state and the expression of several hundred genes in trans. Among 
      the genes regulated by FMR4, we found enrichment for those involved in neural 
      development and cellular proliferation. S-phase marker assays further 
      demonstrated that FMR4 may promote cellular proliferation, rather than 
      differentiation, of human neural precursor cells (hNPCs). By establishing this 
      novel function for FMR4 in hNPCs, we lend support to existing evidence of the 
      epigenetic involvement of lncRNA in nervous system development, and increase our 
      understanding of the complex pathogenesis underlying neurological disorders 
      associated with FMR1 repeat expansions.

LID - 10.1007/s00438-016-1167-2 [doi]
AB  - A gene-level targeted enrichment method for direct detection of epigenetic 
      modifications is described. The approach is demonstrated on the CGG-repeat region 
      of the FMR1 gene, for which large repeat expansions, hitherto refractory to 
      sequencing, are known to cause fragile X syndrome. In addition to achieving a 
      single-locus enrichment of nearly 700,000-fold, the elimination of all 
      amplification steps removes PCR-induced bias in the repeat count and preserves 
      the native epigenetic modifications of the DNA. In conjunction with the 
      single-molecule real-time sequencing approach, this enrichment method enables 
      direct readout of the methylation status and the CGG repeat number of the FMR1 
      allele(s) for a clonally derived cell line. The current method avoids potential 
      biases introduced through chemical modification and/or amplification methods for 
      indirect detection of CpG methylation events.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Almost all patients with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) exhibit a CGG repeat 
      expansion (full mutation) in the Fragile Mental Retardation 1 gene (FMR1). Here, 
      the authors report five unrelated males with FXS harboring a somatic full 
      mutation/deletion mosaicism. METHODS: Mutational profiles were only elucidated by 
      using a combination of molecular approaches (CGG-based PCR, Sanger sequencing, 
      MS-MLPA, Southern blot and mPCR). RESULTS: Four patients exhibited small 
      deletions encompassing the CGG repeats tract and flanking regions, whereas the 
      remaining had a larger deletion comprising at least exon 1 and part of intron 1 
      of FMR1 gene. The presence of a 2-3 base pairs microhomology in proximal and 
      distal non-recurrent breakpoints without scars supports the involvement of 
      microhomology mediated induced repair (MMBIR) mechanism in three small deletions. 
      CONCLUSION: The authors data highlights the importance of using different 
      research methods to elucidate atypical FXS mutational profiles, which are 
      clinically undistinguishable and may have been underestimated.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the commonest cause of inherited mental retardation 
      and clinically presents with learning, emotional and behaviour problems. FXS is 
      caused by expansion of cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeats present in the 5' 
      untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. The aim of this study was to screen 
      children attending special education institutions in Sri Lanka to estimate the 
      prevalence of CGG repeat expansions. The study population comprised a 
      representative national sample of 850 children (540 males, 310 females) with 5 to 
      18 years of age from moderate to severe mental retardation of wide ranging 
      aetiology. Screening for CGG repeat expansion was carried out on DNA extracted 
      from buccal cells using 3' direct triplet primed PCR followed by melting curve 
      analysis. To identify the expanded status of screened positive samples, capillary 
      electrophoresis, methylation specific PCR and Southern hybridization were carried 
      out using venous blood samples. Prevalence of CGG repeat expansions was 2.2%. 
      Further classification of the positive samples into FXS full mutation, 
      pre-mutation and grey zone gave prevalence of 1.3%, 0.8% and 0.1% respectively. 
      All positive cases were male. No females with FXS were detected in our study may 
      have been due to the small sample size.

TI  - A 3' untranslated region variant in FMR1 eliminates neuronal activity-dependent 
      translation of FMRP by disrupting binding of the RNA-binding protein HuR.
PG  - E6553-61
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1514260112 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is a common cause of intellectual disability and autism 
      spectrum disorder. The gene underlying the disorder, fragile X mental retardation 
      1 (FMR1), is silenced in most cases by a CGG-repeat expansion mutation in the 5' 
      untranslated region (UTR). Recently, we identified a variant located in the 3'UTR 
      of FMR1 enriched among developmentally delayed males with normal repeat lengths. 
      A patient-derived cell line revealed reduced levels of endogenous fragile X 
      mental retardation protein (FMRP), and a reporter containing a patient 3'UTR 
      caused a decrease in expression. A control reporter expressed in cultured mouse 
      cortical neurons showed an expected increase following synaptic stimulation that 
      was absent when expressing the patient reporter, suggesting an impaired response 
      to neuronal activity. Mobility-shift assays using a control RNA detected an 
      RNA-protein interaction that is lost with the patient RNA, and HuR was 
      subsequently identified as an associated protein. Cross-linking 
      immunoprecipitation experiments identified the locus as an in vivo target of HuR, 
      supporting our in vitro findings. These data suggest that the disrupted 
      interaction of HuR impairs activity-dependent translation of FMRP, which may 
      hinder synaptic plasticity in a clinically significant fashion.

TI  - Presence of inclusions positive for polyglycine containing protein, FMRpolyG, 
      indicates that repeat-associated non-AUG translation plays a role in fragile 
      X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency.
PG  - 158-68
LID - 10.1093/humrep/dev280 [doi]
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Does repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation play a role in 
      fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), leading to the 
      presence of polyglycine containing protein (FMRpolyG)-positive inclusions in 
      ovarian tissue? SUMMARY ANSWER: Ovaries of a woman with FXPOI and of an Fmr1 
      premutation (PM) mouse model (exCGG-KI) contain intranuclear inclusions that 
      stain positive for both FMRpolyG and ubiquitin. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Women who 
      carry the FMR1 PM are at 20-fold increased risk to develop primary ovarian 
      insufficiency (FXPOI). A toxic RNA gain-of-function has been suggested as the 
      underlying mechanism since the PM results in increased levels of mRNA containing 
      an expanded repeat, but reduced protein levels of fragile X mental retardation 
      protein (FMRP). Recently, RAN translation has been shown to occur from FMR1 mRNA 
      that contains PM repeat expansions, leading to FMRpolyG inclusions in brain and 
      non-CNS tissues of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) patients. 
      STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Ovaries of a woman with FXPOI and women without PM 
      (controls), and ovaries from wild-type and exCGG-KI mice were analyzed by 
      immunohistochemistry for the presence of inclusions that stained for ubiquitin 
      and FMRpolyG . The ovaries from wild-type and exCGG-KI mice were further 
      characterized for the number of follicles, Fmr1 mRNA levels and FMRP protein 
      expression. The presence of inclusions was also analyzed in pituitaries of a man 
      with FXTAS and the exCGG-KI mice. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Human 
      ovaries from a woman with FXPOI and two control subjects and pituitaries from a 
      man with FXTAS and a control subjects were fixed in 4% formalin. Ovaries and 
      pituitaries of wild-type and exCGG mice were fixed in Bouin's fluid or 4% 
      paraformaldehyde. Immunohistochemistry was performed on the human and mouse 
      samples using FMRpolyG, ubiquitin and Fmrp antibodies. Fmr1 mRNA and protein 
      expression were determined in mouse ovaries by quantitative RT-PCR and Western 
      blot analysis. Follicle numbers in mouse ovaries were determined in serial 
      sections by microscopy. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: FMRpolyG-positive 
      inclusions were present in ovarian stromal cells of a woman with FXPOI but not in 
      the ovaries of control subjects. The FMRpolyG-positive inclusions colocalized 
      with ubiquitin-positive inclusions. Similar inclusions were also observed in the 
      pituitary of a man with FXTAS but not in control subjects. Similarly, ovaries of 
      40-week-old exCGG-KI mice, but not wild-type mice, contained numerous inclusions 
      in the stromal cells that stained for both FMRpolyG- and ubiquitin, while the 
      ovaries of 20-week-old exCGG-KI contained fewer inclusions. At 40 weeks ovarian 
      Fmr1 mRNA expression was increased by 5-fold in exCGG-KI mice compared with 
      wild-type mice, while Fmrp expression was reduced by 2-fold. With respect to 
      ovarian function in exCGG-KI mice: (i) although the number of healthy growing 
      follicles did not differ between wild-type and exCGG-KI mice, the number of 
      atretic large antral follicles was increased by nearly 9-fold in 40-week old 
      exCGG-KI mice (P < 0.001); (ii) at 40 weeks of age only 50% of exCGG-KI mice had 
      recent ovulations compared with 89% in wild-type mice (P = 0.07) and (iii) those 
      exCGG-KI mice with recent ovulations tended to have a reduced number of fresh 
      corpora lutea (4.8 +/- 1.74 versus 8.50 +/- 0.98, exCGG-KI versus wild-type mice, 
      respectively, P = 0.07). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Although 
      FMRpolyG-positive inclusions were detected in ovaries of both a woman with FXPOI 
      and a mouse model of the FMR1 PM, we only analyzed one ovary from a FXPOI 
      subject. Caution is needed to extrapolate these results to all women with the 
      FMR1 PM. Furthermore, the functional consequence of FMRpolyG-positive inclusions 
      in the ovaries for reproduction remains to be determined. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF 
      THE FINDINGS: Our results suggest that a dysfunctional 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal-axis may contribute to FXPOI in FMR1 PM carriers.

TI  - In situ optical sequencing and structure analysis of a trinucleotide repeat 
      genome region by localization microscopy after specific COMBO-FISH nano-probing.
PG  - 17938-46
LID - 10.1039/c5nr04141d [doi]
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansions (like (CGG)n) of chromatin in the genome of cell 
      nuclei can cause neurological disorders such as for example the Fragile-X 
      syndrome. Until now the mechanisms are not clearly understood as to how these 
      expansions develop during cell proliferation. Therefore in situ investigations of 
      chromatin structures on the nanoscale are required to better understand 
      supra-molecular mechanisms on the single cell level. By super-resolution 
      localization microscopy (Spectral Position Determination Microscopy; SPDM) in 
      combination with nano-probing using COMBO-FISH (COMBinatorial Oligonucleotide 
      FISH), novel insights into the nano-architecture of the genome will become 
      possible. The native spatial structure of trinucleotide repeat expansion genome 
      regions was analysed and optical sequencing of repetitive units was performed 
      within 3D-conserved nuclei using SPDM after COMBO-FISH. We analysed a 
      (CGG)n-expansion region inside the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. The 
      number of CGG repeats for a full mutation causing the Fragile-X syndrome was 
      found and also verified by Southern blot. The FMR1 promotor region was similarly 
      condensed like a centromeric region whereas the arrangement of the probes 
      labelling the expansion region seemed to indicate a loop-like nano-structure. 
      These results for the first time demonstrate that in situ chromatin structure 
      measurements on the nanoscale are feasible. Due to further methodological 
      progress it will become possible to estimate the state of trinucleotide repeat 
      mutations in detail and to determine the associated chromatin strand structural 
      changes on the single cell level. In general, the application of the described 
      approach to any genome region will lead to new insights into genome 
      nano-architecture and open new avenues for understanding mechanisms and their 
      relevance in the development of heredity diseases.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual 
      disability, resulting from a CGG repeat expansion in the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Here, we report a strategy for CGG repeat correction 
      using CRISPR/Cas9 for targeted deletion in both embryonic stem cells and induced 
      pluripotent stem cells derived from FXS patients. Following gene correction in 
      FXS induced pluripotent stem cells, FMR1 expression was restored and sustained in 
      neural precursor cells and mature neurons. Strikingly, after removal of the CGG 
      repeats, the upstream CpG island of the FMR1 promoter showed extensive 
      demethylation, an open chromatin state, and transcription initiation. These 
      results suggest a silencing maintenance mechanism for the FMR1 promoter that is 
      dependent on the existence of the CGG repeat expansion. Our strategy for deletion 
      of trinucleotide repeats provides further insights into the molecular mechanisms 
      of FXS and future therapies of trinucleotide repeat disorders.

TI  - Mutsbeta generates both expansions and contractions in a mouse model of the Fragile 
      X-associated disorders.
PG  - 7087-96
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddv408 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X-associated disorders are Repeat Expansion Diseases that result from 
      expansion of a CGG/CCG-repeat in the FMR1 gene. Contractions of the repeat tract 
      also occur, albeit at lower frequency. However, these contractions can 
      potentially modulate disease symptoms or generate an allele with repeat numbers 
      in the normal range. Little is known about the expansion mechanism and even less 
      about contractions. We have previously demonstrated that the mismatch repair 
      (MMR) protein MSH2 is required for expansions in a mouse model of these 
      disorders. Here, we show that MSH3, the MSH2-binding partner in the MutSbeta 
      complex, is required for 98% of germ line expansions and all somatic expansions 
      in this model. In addition, we provide evidence for two different contraction 
      mechanisms that operate in the mouse model, a MutSbeta-independent one that 
      generates small contractions and a MutSbeta-dependent one that generates larger 
      ones. We also show that MutSbeta complexes formed with the repeats have altered 
      kinetics of ATP hydrolysis relative to complexes with bona fide MMR substrates 
      and that MutSbeta increases the stability of the CCG-hairpins at physiological 
      temperatures. These data may have important implications for our understanding of 
      the mechanism(s) of repeat instability and for the role of MMR proteins in this 
      process.

AB  - CGG repeat expansions in the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are 
      responsible for a family of associated disorders characterized by either 
      intellectual disability and autism Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), or adult-onset 
      neurodegeneration Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome. However, the FMR1 
      locus is complex and encodes several long non-coding RNAs, whose expression is 
      altered by repeat expansion mutations. The role of these lncRNAs is thus far 
      unknown; therefore we investigated the functionality of FMR4, which we previously 
      identified. "Full"-length expansions of the FMR1 triplet repeat cause silencing 
      of both FMR1 and FMR4, thus we are interested in potential loss-of-function that 
      may add to phenotypic manifestation of FXS. Since the two transcripts do not 
      exhibit cis-regulation of one another, we examined the potential for FMR4 to 
      regulate target genes at distal genomic loci using gene expression microarrays. 
      We identified FMR4-responsive genes, including the methyl-CpG-binding domain 
      protein 4 (MBD4). Furthermore, we found that in differentiating human neural 
      precursor cells, FMR4 expression is developmentally regulated in opposition to 
      expression of both FMR1 (which is expected to share a bidirectional promoter with 
      FMR4) and MBD4. We therefore propose that FMR4's function is as a gene-regulatory 
      lncRNA and that this transcript may function in normal development. Closer 
      examination of FMR4 increases our understanding of the role of regulatory lncRNA 
      and the consequences of FMR1 repeat expansions.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) results from a "premutation" 
      (PM) size CGG repeat expansion in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. 
      Cerebellar gait ataxia is the primary feature in some FXTAS patients causing 
      progressive disability. However, no studies have quantitatively characterized 
      gait and mobility deficits in FXTAS. We performed quantitative gait and mobility 
      analysis in seven FMR1 PM carriers with FXTAS and ataxia, six PM carriers without 
      FXTAS, and 18 age-matched controls. We studied four independent gait domains, 
      trunk range of motion (ROM), and movement transitions using an instrumented Timed 
      Up and Go (i-TUG). We correlated these outcome measures with FMR1 molecular 
      variables and clinical severity scales. PM carriers with FXTAS were globally 
      impaired in every gait performance domain except trunk ROM compared to controls. 
      These included total i-TUG duration, stride velocity, gait cycle time, cadence, 
      double-limb support and swing phase times, turn duration, step time before turn, 
      and turn-to-sit duration, and increased gait variability on several measures. 
      Carriers without FXTAS did not differ from controls on any parameters, but 
      double-limb support time was close to significance. Balance and disability scales 
      correlated with multiple gait and movement transition parameters, while the FXTAS 
      Rating Scale did not. This is the first study to quantitatively examine gait and 
      movement transitions in FXTAS patients. Gait characteristics were consistent with 
      those from previous cohorts with cerebellar ataxia. Sensitive measures like the 
      i-TUG may help determine efficacy of interventions, characterize disease 
      progression, and provide early markers of disease in FXTAS.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex autoimmune disease originated from the 
      interplay between genetic and environmental factors. An overlap of clinical and 
      neuroradiological parameters has been described between MS and an adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder, the fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS). This syndrome is caused by a trinucleotide premutation expansion of a 
      CGG sequence in the 55-200 repeat range, which is located in the fragile-X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Female premutation carriers have an increased 
      propensity for immune-mediated disorders. Recently, a case of co-occurrence of MS 
      and FXTAS was reported. Assuming that the premutation expansion may play a role 
      in the MS susceptibility, we evaluated its frequency in a cohort of MS patients 
      from Sardinia, an island characterized by a very high frequency of MS. Nuclear 
      DNA was extracted by standard methods, purified with bisulfite treatment and then 
      amplified twice by PCR with specific primers. Microsatellite analysis was 
      performed and emizogotic subjects were sequenced. Clinical data of patients were 
      also collected. Only 1/755 MS patients exhibited the premutation expansion with a 
      heterozygosis pattern (30/58). No pathogenic repeat expansions (>200 repeats) 
      were found in the entire cohort. Repeats labeled as the gray zone (45-60 repeats) 
      were observed in 15/755 patients. No specific clinical features concerning 
      disease course, disease activity, and disability were reported for these 
      patients. Our results do not support a possible role for premutation or gray zone 
      alleles in MS Sardinian patients. Further studies are needed to better understand 
      the relationship between FXTAS and MS.

AB  - A hexanucleotide repeat expansion residing within the C9ORF72 gene represents the 
      most common known cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and places the 
      disease among a growing family of repeat expansion disorders. The presence of RNA 
      foci, repeat-associated translation products, and sequestration of RNA binding 
      proteins suggests that toxic RNA gain-of-function contributes to pathology while 
      C9ORF72 haploinsufficiency may be an additional pathological factor. One viable 
      therapeutic strategy for treating expansion diseases is the use of small molecule 
      inhibitors of epigenetic modifier proteins to reactivate expanded genetic loci. 
      Indeed, previous studies have established proof of this principle by increasing 
      the drug-induced expression of expanded (and abnormally heterochromatinized) 
      FMR1, FXN and C9ORF72 genes in respective patient cells. While epigenetic 
      modifier proteins are increasingly recognized as druggable targets, there have 
      been few screening strategies to address this avenue of drug discovery in the 
      context of expansion diseases. Here we utilize a semi-high-throughput gene 
      expression based screen to identify siRNAs and small molecule inhibitors of 
      epigenetic modifier proteins that regulate C9ORF72 RNA in patient fibroblasts, 
      lymphocytes and reprogrammed motor neurons. We found that several bromodomain 
      small molecule inhibitors increase the expression of C9ORF72 mRNA and pre-mRNA 
      without affecting repressive epigenetic signatures of expanded C9ORF72 alleles. 
      These data suggest that bromodomain inhibition increases the expression of 
      unexpanded C9ORF72 alleles and may therefore compensate for haploinsufficiency 
      without increasing the production of toxic RNA and protein products, thereby 
      conferring therapeutic value.

TI  - Distribution of fragile X mental retardation 1 CGG repeat and flanking haplotypes 
      in a large Chinese population.
PG  - 172-81
LID - 10.1002/mgg3.128 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is mainly caused by a CGG repeat expansion within the 5' UTR 
      of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Previous analyses of the FMR1 
      CGG repeat patterns and flanking haplotypes in Caucasians and African Americans 
      have identified several factors that may influence repeat instability. However, 
      the CGG repeat patterns and distribution for FRAXAC2 have not yet been 
      investigated in mainland Chinese. We surveyed the CGG repeat lengths in 1113 Han 
      Chinese (534 males and 579 females), and the CGG repeat patterns of 534 males 
      were determined by sequence analysis. We also explored the flanking haplotypes 
      (DXS548-FRAXAC1-FRAXAC2) in 566 unaffected and 28 unrelated fragile X Chinese 
      males. The most frequent alleles for DXS548 and FRAXAC1 were identical between 
      our Chinese population and other Asian populations. We identified several 
      low-abundance alleles for DXS548 and FRAXAC1 not found in previous studies in 
      mainland Chinese and Taiwanese cohorts. The most frequent allele was (CGG)29 
      followed by (CGG)30, and the most frequent patterns were 9 + 9 + 9, 10 + 9 + 9, 
      and 9 + 9 + 6 + 9, similar to those in Singaporeans. We identified only one 
      premutation female carrier with 89 CGG repeats in the 1113 Han Chinese. A few 
      associations between the CGG repeat patterns and flanking haplotypes were 
      determined in this study. In general, the Chinese population had a smaller number 
      of alleles and lower expected heterozygosity for all three STR markers and FRAXA 
      locus when compared with Caucasians and African Americans. We identified a novel 
      haplotype 7-3-5 + that is significantly associated with the full mutation.

TI  - RAN translation at CGG repeats induces ubiquitin proteasome system impairment in 
      models of fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome.
PG  - 4317-26
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddv165 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of the 
      Fragile X gene, FMR1. FXTAS is thought to arise primarily from an RNA 
      gain-of-function toxicity mechanism. However, recent studies demonstrate that the 
      repeat also elicits production of a toxic polyglycine protein, FMRpolyG, via 
      repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN)-initiated translation. Pathologically, FXTAS is 
      characterized by ubiquitin-positive intranuclear neuronal inclusions, raising the 
      possibility that failure of protein quality control pathways could contribute to 
      disease pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we used Drosophila- and cell-based 
      models of CGG-repeat-associated toxicity. In Drosophila, ubiquitin proteasome 
      system (UPS) impairment led to enhancement of CGG-repeat-induced degeneration, 
      whereas overexpression of the chaperone protein HSP70 suppressed this toxicity. 
      In transfected mammalian cells, CGG repeat expression triggered accumulation of a 
      UPS reporter in a length-dependent fashion. To delineate the contributions from 
      CGG repeats as RNA from RAN translation-associated toxicity, we enhanced or 
      impaired the production of FMRpolyG in these models. Driving expression of 
      FMRpolyG enhanced induction of UPS impairment in cell models, while prevention of 
      RAN translation attenuated UPS impairment in cells and suppressed the genetic 
      interaction with UPS manipulation in Drosophila. Taken together, these findings 
      suggest that CGG repeats induce UPS impairment at least in part through 
      activation of RAN translation.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited intellectual disability 
      syndrome, is caused by expansion and hypermethylation of the CGG repeat in the 5' 
      UTR of the FMR1 gene. This expanded repeat, also known as the rare fragile site 
      FRAXA, causes X chromosome fragility in cultured cells from patients but only 
      when induced by perturbing pyrimidine synthesis. We performed preimplantation 
      genetic diagnosis (PGD) on 595 blastomeres biopsied from 442 cleavage stage 
      embryos at risk for FXS using short tandem repeat (STR) markers. In six 
      blastomeres, from five embryos an incomplete haplotype was observed with loss of 
      all alleles telomeric to the CGG repeat. In all five embryos, the incomplete 
      haplotype corresponded to the haplotype carrying the CGG repeat expansion. 
      Subsequent analysis of additional blastomeres from three embryos by array 
      comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) confirmed the presence of a terminal 
      deletion with a breakpoint close to the CGG repeat in two blastomeres from one 
      embryo. A blastomere from another embryo showed the complementary duplication. We 
      conclude that a CGG repeat expansion at FRAXA causes X chromosome fragility in 
      early human IVF embryos at risk for FXS.

TI  - Heterozygosity for a hypomorphic Polbeta mutation reduces the expansion frequency in

AB  - The Fragile X-related disorders (FXDs) are members of the Repeat Expansion 
      Diseases, a group of human genetic conditions resulting from expansion of a 
      specific tandem repeat. The FXDs result from expansion of a CGG/CCG repeat tract 
      in the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene. While expansion in a FXD mouse model is known to 
      require some mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, our previous work and work in mouse 
      models of another Repeat Expansion Disease show that early events in the base 
      excision repair (BER) pathway play a role in the expansion process. One model for 
      repeat expansion proposes that a non-canonical MMR process makes use of the nicks 
      generated early in BER to load the MMR machinery that then generates expansions. 
      However, we show here that heterozygosity for a Y265C mutation in Polbeta, a key 
      polymerase in the BER pathway, is enough to significantly reduce both the number 
      of expansions seen in paternal gametes and the extent of somatic expansion in 
      some tissues of the FXD mouse. These data suggest that events in the BER pathway 
      downstream of the generation of nicks are also important for repeat expansion. 
      Somewhat surprisingly, while the number of expansions is smaller, the average 
      size of the residual expansions is larger than that seen in WT animals. This may 
      have interesting implications for the mechanism by which BER generates 
      expansions.

AB  - Fragile-X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual 
      disability (ID) and affects 0.7-3.0% of intellectually compromised population of 
      unknown etiology worldwide. It is mostly caused by repeat expansion mutations in 
      the FMR1 at chromosome Xq27.3. The present study aimed to develop molecular 
      diagnostic tools for a better detection of FXS, to assess implementation of 
      diagnostic protocols in a developing country and to estimate the prevalence of 
      FXS in a cohort of intellectually disabled subjects from Pakistan. From a large 
      pool of individuals with below normal IQ range, 395 subjects with intellectual 
      disability of unknown etiology belonging to different regions of the country were 
      recruited. Conventional-PCR, modified-PCR and Southern blot analysis methods were 
      employed for the detection of CGG repeat polymorphisms in the FMR1 gene. Initial 
      screening with conventional-PCR identified 13 suspected patients. Subsequent 
      investigations through modified PCR and Southern blot analyses confirmed the 
      presence of the FMR1 mutation, suggesting a prevalence of 3.5% and 2.8% (mean 
      3.3%) among the male and female ID patients, respectively. These diagnostic 
      methods were further customized with the in-house conditions to offer robust 
      screening of referral patients/families for diagnostics and genetic counseling. 
      Prescreening and early diagnosis are crucial for designing a prudent strategy for 
      the management of subjects with ID. Outcome of the study recommends health 
      practitioners for implementation of molecular based FXS diagnosis in routine 
      clinical practice to give a better care for patients similar to the ones included 
      in the study.

TI  - Nuclear accumulation of mRNAs underlies G4C2-repeat-induced translational 
      repression in a cellular model of C9orf72 ALS.
PG  - 1787-99
LID - 10.1242/jcs.165332 [doi]
AB  - A common feature of non-coding repeat expansion disorders is the accumulation of 
      RNA repeats as RNA foci in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm of affected cells. These 
      RNA foci can be toxic because they sequester RNA-binding proteins, thus affecting 
      various steps of post-transcriptional gene regulation. However, the precise step 
      that is affected by C9orf72 GGGGCC (G4C2) repeat expansion, the major genetic 
      cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is still poorly defined. In this 
      work, we set out to characterise these mechanisms by identifying proteins that 
      bind to C9orf72 RNA. Sequestration of some of these factors into RNA foci was 
      observed when a (G4C2)31 repeat was expressed in NSC34 and HeLa cells. Most 
      notably, (G4C2)31 repeats widely affected the distribution of Pur-alpha and its 
      binding partner fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (FMRP, also known as 
      FMR1), which accumulate in intra-cytosolic granules that are positive for stress 
      granules markers. Accordingly, translational repression is induced. 
      Interestingly, this effect is associated with a marked accumulation of poly(A) 
      mRNAs in cell nuclei. Thus, defective trafficking of mRNA, as a consequence of 
      impaired nuclear mRNA export, might affect translation efficiency and contribute 
      to the pathogenesis of C9orf72 ALS.

AB  - Recently developed PCR-based methods for fragile X syndrome testing are often 
      regarded as screening tools because of a reduced reliance on Southern blot 
      analysis. However, existing PCR methods rely essentially on capillary 
      electrophoresis for the analysis of amplicons. These methods not only require an 
      expensive capillary electrophoresis instrument but also involve post-PCR 
      processing steps. Here, we evaluated a commercially available PCR-based assay 
      that uses melt curve analysis as a screening tool for the rapid detection of CGG 
      repeat expansions in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. On the basis 
      of testing with well-characterized DNA samples, the assay gave a detection limit 
      of 10 ng per reaction and an analytic specificity beyond 150 ng per reaction. 
      Furthermore, the melt temperatures critical for result interpretation were found 
      to be closely linked to the CGG expansion lengths with great consistency (CV < 
      0.55%). The clinical performance of the assay was established with 528 blinded 
      and previously analyzed clinical samples, yielding results of 100% sensitivity 
      (95% CI, 91.0%-100%) and 99.6% specificity (95% CI, 98.5%-99.9%) in detecting 
      expansions >55 CGG repeats in FMR1. This new approach eliminates post-PCR 
      handling for all non-expanded samples, and exemplifies a truly efficient 
      screening procedure.

TI  - Characterization and Early Detection of Balance Deficits in Fragile X Premutation 
      Carriers With and Without Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS).
PG  - 650-62
LID - 10.1007/s12311-015-0659-7 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) results from a "premutation" 
      size 55-200 CGG repeat expansion in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) 
      gene. Core motor features include cerebellar gait ataxia and kinetic tremor, 
      resulting in progressive mobility disability. There are no published studies 
      characterizing balance deficits in FMR1 premutation carriers with and without 
      FXTAS using a battery of quantitative measures to test the sensory integration 
      underlying postural control, automatic postural reflexes, and dynamic postural 
      stability limits. Computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) and two 
      performance-based balance measures were administered in 44 premutation carriers, 
      21 with FXTAS and 23 without FXTAS, and 42 healthy controls to compare balance 
      and functional mobility between these groups. Relationships between FMR1 
      molecular variables, age, and sex and CDP scores were explored. FXTAS subjects 
      demonstrated significantly lower scores on the sensory organization test (with 
      greatest reductions in the vestibular control of balance), longer response 
      latencies to balance perturbations, and reduced stability limits compared to 
      controls. Premutation carriers without FXTAS also demonstrated significantly 
      delayed response latencies and disrupted sensory weighting for balance control. 
      Advancing age, male sex, increased CGG repeat size, and reduced X activation of 
      the normal allele in premutation carrier women predicted balance dysfunction. 
      These postural control deficits in carriers with and without FXTAS implicate 
      dysfunctional cerebellar neural networks and may provide valuable outcome markers 
      for tailored rehabilitative interventions. Our findings suggest that CDP may 
      provide sensitive measures for early detection of postural control impairments in 
      at-risk carriers and better characterize balance dysfunction and progression in 
      FXTAS.

TI  - The transcription-coupled repair protein ERCC6/CSB also protects against repeat 
      expansion in a mouse model of the fragile X premutation.
PG  - 482-7
LID - 10.1002/humu.22777 [doi]
AB  - The fragile X-related disorders (FXDs) are members of the group of diseases known 
      as the repeat expansion diseases. The FXDs result from expansion of an unstable 
      CGG/CCG repeat tract in the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene. Contractions are also seen, 
      albeit at lower frequency. We have previously shown that ERCC6/CSB plays an 
      auxiliary role in promoting germ line and somatic expansions in a mouse model of 
      the FXDs. However, work in model systems of other repeat expansion diseases has 
      suggested that CSB may protect against expansions by promoting contractions. 
      Since FXD mice normally have such a high expansion frequency, it is possible that 
      such a protective effect would have been masked. We thus examined the effect of 
      the loss of CSB in an Msh2(+/-) background where the germ line expansion 
      frequency is reduced and in an Msh2(-/-) background where expansions do not 
      occur, but contractions do. Our data show that in addition to promoting repeat 
      expansion, CSB does in fact protect the genome from germ line expansions in the 
      FXD mouse model. However, it likely does so not by promoting contractions but by 
      promoting an error-free process that preserves the parental allele.

TI  - A novel fragile X syndrome mutation reveals a conserved role for the 
      carboxy-terminus in FMRP localization and function.
PG  - 423-37
LID - 10.15252/emmm.201404576 [doi]
AB  - Loss of function of the FMR1 gene leads to fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most 
      common form of intellectual disability. The loss of FMR1 function is usually 
      caused by epigenetic silencing of the FMR1 promoter leading to expansion and 
      subsequent methylation of a CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region. Very few 
      coding sequence variations have been experimentally characterized and shown to be 
      causal to the disease. Here, we describe a novel FMR1 mutation and reveal an 
      unexpected nuclear export function for the C-terminus of FMRP. We screened a 
      cohort of patients with typical FXS symptoms who tested negative for CGG repeat 
      expansion in the FMR1 locus. In one patient, we identified a guanine insertion in 
      FMR1 exon 15. This mutation alters the open reading frame creating a short novel 
      C-terminal sequence, followed by a stop codon. We find that this novel peptide 
      encodes a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) targeting the patient FMRP 
      to the nucleolus in human cells. We also reveal an evolutionarily conserved 
      nuclear export function associated with the endogenous C-terminus of FMRP. In 
      vivo analyses in Drosophila demonstrate that a patient-mimetic mutation alters 
      the localization and function of Dfmrp in neurons, leading to neomorphic neuronal 
      phenotypes.

LID - 1000119 [pii]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common single gene cause of intellectual 
      disability and it is characterized by a CGG expansion of more than 200 repeats in 
      the FMR1 gene, leading to methylation of the promoter and gene silencing. The 
      fragile X premutation, characterized by a 55 to 200 CGG repeat expansion, causes 
      health problems and developmental difficulties in some, but not all, carriers. 
      The premutation causes primary ovarian insufficiency in approximately 20% of 
      females, psychiatric problems (including depression and/or anxiety) in 
      approximately 50% of carriers and a neurodegenerative disorder, the fragile 
      X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), in approximately 40% of males and 
      16% of females later in life. Recent clinical studies in premutation carriers 
      have expanded the health problems that may be seen. Advances in the molecular 
      pathogenesis of the premutation have shown significant mitochondrial dysfunction 
      and oxidative stress in neurons which may be amenable to treatment. Here we 
      review the clinical problems of carriers and treatment recommendations.

TI  - FMR1 gene mutation screening by TP-PCR in patients with premature ovarian failure 
      and fragile-X.
PG  - 191-5
LID - 10.3109/09513590.2014.975685 [doi]
AB  - CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene is associated with fragile X syndrome, 
      fragile X-associated tremor/ ataxia syndrome and fragile X-associated primary 
      ovarian insufficiency. In this study, FMR1 gene mutation screening was carried 
      out in 50 patients. Among them, 12 (%24) were POF and 19 (%38) were Fragile-X. We 
      also examined the parents of the Fragile-X patients. DNA was extracted from blood 
      with kit procedure. To examine expansion of the fragile-X CGG repeat, TP-PCR 
      assay was performed and all amplicons were evaluated on an ABI3130XL Genetic 
      Analyzer System by Fragman analysis. The data were analyzed by Gene Mapper 
      Program. As a result of this study, the patients were identified with the 
      fragile-X whose FMR1 gene CGG alleles have been observed in normal range. 
      However, in patients who were referred with premature ovarian failure, 
      pre-mutation frequency was observed as 6.6%. Only limited study in Turkish 
      population reported frequency of pre-mutation carrier in POF and Fragile-X. 
      Detection of pre-mutation carrier is important for next generation to have 
      healthy siblings. We emphasize that TP-PCR technique is clear, reliable, 
      sensitive, easy and fast method to detect pre-mutation. However, full mutations 
      have to be examined by the technique of Southern blot in the diagnosis of 
      fragile-X.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by CGG repeat expansion that leads to FMR1 
      silencing. Women with a premutation allele are at risk of having a full mutation 
      child with FXS. To investigate the mechanism of repeat expansion, we examined the 
      relationship between a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant that is 
      linked to repeat expansion in haplogroup D and a replication origin located  approximately 53 
      kb upstream of the repeats. This origin is absent in FXS human embryonic stem 
      cells (hESCs), which have the SNP variant C, but present in the nonaffected 
      hESCs, which have a T variant. The SNP maps directly within the replication 
      origin. Interestingly, premutation hESCs have a replication origin and the T 
      variant similar to nonaffected hESCs. These results suggest that a T/C SNP 
      located at a replication origin could contribute to the inactivation of this 
      replication origin in FXS hESCs, leading to altered replication fork progression 
      through the repeats, which could result in repeat expansion to the FXS full 
      mutation.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common cause of intellectual disability, 
      developmental delay and autism spectrum disorders. This syndrome is due to a 
      functional loss of the FMR1 gene product FMRP, and, in most cases, it is caused 
      by CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 promoter. Yet, also other FMR1 mutations may 
      cause a FXS-like phenotype. Since standard molecular testing does not include the 
      analysis of the FMR1 coding region, the prevalence of point mutations causing FXS 
      is not well known. Here, high resolution melting (HRM) was used to screen for 
      FMR1 gene mutations in 508 males with clinical signs of mental retardation and 
      developmental delay, but without CGG and GCC repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene 
      and AFF2 genes, respectively. Sequence variations were identified by HRM analysis 
      and verified by direct DNA sequencing. Two novel missense mutations (p.Gly482Ser 
      in one patient and p.Arg534His in two unrelated patients), one intronic and two 
      3'-untranslated region (UTR) variations were identified in the FMR1 gene. 
      Missense mutations in the FMR1 gene might account for a considerable proportion 
      of cases in male patients with FXS-related symptoms, such as those linked to 
      mental retardation and developmental delay.

AB  - Whereas full mutation CGG-repeat expansions (>200 repeats) of the fragile X gene 
      (FMR1) give rise to the neurodevelopmental disorder, fragile X syndrome (FXS); 
      smaller, 'premutation' expansions (55 to 200 repeats) are now gaining increasing 
      recognition as the basis for a spectrum of clinical involvement, from 
      neurodevelopmental problems; to mid-adult disorders, such as primary ovarian 
      insufficiency and mood and psychiatric disorders; to the late-adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). 
      The premutation disorders are thought to arise through a molecular mechanism 
      involving toxicity of the elevated levels of expanded CGG-repeat mRNA ('RNA 
      toxicity'), a process that is entirely distinct from the FMR1 protein-deficiency 
      that gives rise to FXS. However, despite the importance of the spectrum of 
      clinical disorders associated with the premutation, and a high prevalence rate (1 
      in 130 to 250 females and 1 in 250 to 810 males), relatively little attention has 
      been paid to these disorders and there is a general lack of awareness among 
      clinicians as to the distinction between the premutation disorders and FXS. To 
      address this lack of awareness, an international conference on the premutation 
      was held in Perugia, Italy, in June 2013. The conference covered the expanding 
      range of clinical involvement, refinements of the assessments and tools for 
      characterizing such involvement, and the rapidly expanding understanding of the 
      pathogenic molecular and cellular mechanisms that give rise to the spectrum of 
      involvement among premutation carriers. All of these advances support ongoing 
      efforts to develop new targeted treatments for the premutation disorders. As an 
      outgrowth of the meeting, papers were solicited from the conference attendees 
      such that groups of scientists and clinicians would develop works that broadly 
      covered the topics of the meeting. The following papers represent that effort.

TI  - Approaches to identify genetic variants that influence the risk for onset of 
      fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI): a preliminary study.
PG  - 260

LID - 260
AB  - Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) is due to an X-linked 
      mutation that results from the expansion of a CGG repeat sequence located in the 
      5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene (premutation, PM). About 20% of women who 
      carry the PM have cessation of menses before age 40, a clinical condition known 
      as premature ovarian failure (POF). This leads to a 20-fold increased risk over 
      women in the general population. Thus, this single gene mutation has a major 
      effect on reducing a woman's reproductive life span. Based on survival analysis 
      of about 1300 women, we showed that the mean age at menopause among PM carriers 
      is reduced compared with noncarriers, even after removing women who reported POF. 
      This suggests that the majority of women with the PM, not just a subset, 
      experience ovarian insufficiency earlier than noncarriers. To better understand 
      the underlying mechanism of the PM and to identify genes that modify the variable 
      expressivity of FXPOI, we conducted two pilot studies. The first focused on five 
      common variants known to reduce age at menopause. We genotyped these SNPs in 72 
      women with a PM who experienced menopause and found a significant association 
      with the total SNP risk burden and age at menopause. This suggests that these 
      SNPs influence onset of FXPOI, after adjusting for the effect of the PM allele. 
      In the second approach, we conducted whole genome sequencing on 10 PM carriers, 
      five with onset of FXPOI prior to age 30 and five who experienced menopause after 
      age 47 years. Although only a pilot study, we describe our preliminary approach 
      to identify potential variants that may play a role in modifying onset of FXPOI 
      and potentially play a role in idiopathic primary ovarian insufficiency. The 
      overarching goal of both approaches is to identify predictor variants that may 
      identify women predisposed to early onset FXPOI and to further identify genes 
      involved in defining a woman's reproductive life span.

TI  - Visual motion processing deficits in infants with the fragile X premutation.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1186/1866-1955-6-29 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from a trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion (full mutation >200 cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeats) in the FMR1 
      gene, leading to a reduction or absence of the gene's protein product, fragile X 
      mental retardation protein (FMRP), ultimately causing cognitive and behavioral 
      impairments that are characteristic of the syndrome. In our previous work with 
      infants and toddlers with FXS, we have been able to describe much about their 
      cognitive and visual processing abilities. In light of recent work on the mild 
      cognitive deficits and functional and structural brain differences that are 
      present in adults with the fragile X (FX) premutation, in the present study we 
      examined whether some of the low-level visual processing deficits we have 
      observed in infants with FXS would also be present in infants with the FX 
      premutation (55-200 CGG repeats). METHODS: We chose a contrast detection task 
      using second-order motion stimuli on which infants with FXS previously showed 
      significantly increased detection thresholds (Vision Res 48:1471-1478, 2008). 
      Critically, we also included a developmental delay comparison group of infants 
      with Down syndrome (DS), who were matched to infants with FXS on both 
      chronological and mental age, to speak to the question of whether this 
      second-order motion processing deficit is a FX-specific phenomenon. RESULTS: As 
      reported previously, infants with the FX full mutation showed motion contrast 
      detection threshold levels that were significantly higher than age-matched 
      typically developing control infants. Strikingly, the motion detection contrast 
      levels of FX premutation infants were also significantly higher than typically 
      developing (TD) infants and not significantly different from the group of infants 
      with FXS or with DS. CONCLUSIONS: These results, which are in keeping with a 
      growing body of evidence on the mild cognitive and perceptual processing deficits 
      and functional and structural brain differences that are present in adults and 
      older children with the FX premutation, underscore the pressing need to study and 
      describe the processing capabilities of infants and toddlers with the FX 
      premutation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a clinically 
      heterogeneous disorder characterized predominantly by tremor, followed by late 
      onset gait ataxia, autonomic dysfunction and/or cognitive impairment. We aimed to 
      screen FMR1-CGG repeats in our cohort of progressive late-onset cerebellar 
      ataxia/tremor cohort to characterize the occurrence of FXTAS in India. METHODS: 
      We have screened FMR1-CGG repeats in 109 patients and 173 healthy control 
      subjects. Our cohort comprised: a)group of patients with predominant cerebellar 
      ataxia and/or tremor. b.)suspected cases of MSA and c.)patients who presented 
      SCA12-like neurological manifestations (late onset predominant tremor and/or 
      ataxia). All the cases were ruled out for known triplet-repeat-expansion (TRE) 
      SCA mutations. RESULTS: We have found three FMR1-premutation carriers among the 
      cases. Two of them (with CGG-96 and CGG-102) were under evaluation for their 
      SCA12-like manifestations and another (CGG-78) had progressive gait ataxia. 
      Overall the frequency of FXTAS in our cohort was found to be 3.3% among cases of 
      late onset cerebellar-ataxia/tremor; however, incidences were higher among cases 
      with SCA12-like syndrome (9%, 2/23). CONCLUSION: Finding FXTAS in patients with 
      SCA12-like manifestation suggests that TRE in the 5'UTR of the gene is the common 
      cue connecting two disorders with common phenotype of tremor/ataxia. This 
      knowledge might shed light upon their sharing of molecular neuropathology.

AB  - Fragile X-associated disorders (FXD) are a group of disorders caused by expansion 
      of non-coding CGG repeat elements in the fragile X (FMR1) gene. One of these 
      disorders, fragile X syndrome (FXS), is the most common heritable cause of 
      intellectual disability, and is caused by large CGG repeat expansions (>200) 
      resulting in silencing of the FMR1 gene. An increasingly recognized number of 
      neuropsychiatric FXD have recently been identified that are caused by 
      'premutation' range expansions (55-200). These disorders are characterized by a 
      spectrum of neuropsychiatric manifestations ranging from an increased risk of 
      neurodevelopmental, mood and anxiety disorders to neurodegenerative phenotypes 
      such as the fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Here, we review 
      advances in the clinical understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders in 
      premutation carriers across the lifespan and offer guidance for the detection of 
      such disorders by practicing psychiatrists and neurologists.

      delivery in fragile X mice.

LID - 10.1038/npp.2014.167 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene that codes for fragile X mental 
      retardation protein (FMRP). To determine if FMRP expression in the central 
      nervous system could reverse phenotypic deficits in the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse 
      model of FXS, we used a single-stranded adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector with 
      viral capsids from serotype 9 that contained a major isoform of FMRP. FMRP 
      transgene expression was driven by the neuron-selective synapsin-1 promoter. The 
      vector was delivered to the brain via a single bilateral intracerebroventricular 
      injection into neonatal Fmr1 KO mice and transgene expression and behavioral 
      assessments were conducted 22-26 or 50-56 days post injection. Western blotting 
      and immunocytochemical analyses of AAV-FMRP-injected mice revealed FMRP 
      expression in the striatum, hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, and cingulate 
      cortex. Cellular expression was selective for neurons and reached  approximately  50% of 
      wild-type levels in the hippocampus and cortex at 56 days post injection. The 
      pathologically elevated repetitive behavior and the deficit in social dominance 
      behavior seen in phosphate-buffered saline-injected Fmr1 KO mice were reversed in 
      AAV-FMRP-injected mice. These results provide the first proof of principle that 
      gene therapy can correct specific behavioral abnormalities in the mouse model of 
      FXS.

AB  - CGG repeat expansion is the most common cause of fragile X syndrome. Numerous 
      efforts have been made to identify novel mutations in patients with intellectual 
      disability, developmental delay, and/or autism. To evaluate the mutational 
      spectrum in the at-risk Chinese population, 60 pediatric patients presenting 
      fragile X traits but normal-sized CGG repeats were sequenced for all 17 exons and 
      regulatory regions in FMR1. A c.879A>C mutation, reported to alter a neighboring 
      splicing, was detected in a severely retarded male and his normal mother. 
      However, the exon junction appears unaffected. A 237-kb deletion covering the 
      entire FMR1 was identified to cause moderate intellectual disability and marked 
      hyperactivity in an 8-year-old boy. The 5' and 3' breakpoints were buried in the 
      surrounding long interspersed and short interspersed elements, respectively. In 
      general, missense mutations do not commonly cause fragile X syndrome, whereas 
      deletions should be considered with caution in patient referrals presenting with 
      developmental delay and/or ordinary retardation.

TI  - TDP-43 suppresses CGG repeat-induced neurotoxicity through interactions with 
      HnRNP A2/B1.
PG  - 5036-51
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddu216 [doi]
AB  - Nucleotide repeat expansions can elicit neurodegeneration as RNA by sequestering 
      specific RNA-binding proteins, preventing them from performing their normal 
      functions. Conversely, mutations in RNA-binding proteins can trigger 
      neurodegeneration at least partly by altering RNA metabolism. In Fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a CGG repeat expansion in the 5'UTR 
      of the fragile X gene (FMR1) leads to progressive neurodegeneration in patients 
      and CGG repeats in isolation elicit toxicity in Drosophila and other animal 
      models. Here, we identify the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated 
      RNA-binding protein TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) as a suppressor of CGG 
      repeat-induced toxicity in a Drosophila model of FXTAS. The rescue appears 
      specific to TDP-43, as co-expression of another ALS-associated RNA-binding 
      protein, FUS, exacerbates the toxic effects of CGG repeats. Suppression of CGG 
      RNA toxicity was abrogated by disease-associated mutations in TDP-43. TDP-43 does 
      not co-localize with CGG RNA foci and its ability to bind RNA is not required for 
      rescue. TDP-43-dependent rescue does, however, require fly hnRNP A2/B1 homologues 
      Hrb87F and Hrb98DE. Deletions in the C-terminal domain of TDP-43 that preclude 
      interactions with hnRNP A2/B1 abolish TDP-43-dependent rescue of CGG repeat 
      toxicity. In contrast, suppression of CGG repeat toxicity by hnRNP A2/B1 is not 
      affected by RNAi-mediated knockdown of the fly TDP-43 orthologue, TBPH. Lastly, 
      TDP-43 suppresses CGG repeat-triggered mis-splicing of an hnRNP A2/B1-targeted 
      transcript. These data support a model in which TDP-43 suppresses CGG-mediated 
      toxicity through interactions with hnRNP A2/B1 and suggest a convergence of 
      pathogenic cascades between repeat expansion disorders and RNA-binding proteins 
      implicated in neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common monogenic form of 
      intellectual disability and one of the few known monogenic causes of autism. It 
      is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 ('Fragile X Mental 
      Retardation 1') gene, which prevents expression of the 'Fragile X Mental 
      Retardation Protein' (FMRP). In FXS, the absence of FMRP leads to altered 
      structural and functional development of the synapse, while preventing 
      activity-based synapse maturation and synaptic pruning, which are essential for 
      normal brain development and cognitive development. Possible impairments in 
      information processing can be non-invasively investigated using 
      electrophysiology. METHODS: We compared auditory (AEP) and visual (VEP) evoked 
      potentials in twelve adolescents and young adults (10-22 years) affected by FXS 
      to healthy controls matched by chronological age (N=12) and developmental age of 
      cognitive functioning (N=9; 5-7 years), using analysis of variance. RESULTS: In 
      the visual modality, the N70 and N2 amplitude have been found increased in FXS in 
      comparison to the chronological, but not the developmental control group at 
      occipital sites, whereas in the auditory modality N1, P2 and N2 amplitude as well 
      as N2 latency have been found increased in FXS, relative to both chronological 
      and developmental control groups at mid-central sites. CONCLUSIONS: The AEP/VEP 
      profile suggests disruptions in sensory processing specific to FXS that exceed 
      immaturity of physiological activity. In addition, the auditory modality seems to 
      be more affected than the visual modality. Results are discussed in light of 
      possible underlying neuronal mechanisms, including deficits in synaptic pruning 
      and neuronal inhibition that might account for a hyperreactive nervous system in 
      FXS.

TI  - X inactivation plays a major role in the gender bias in somatic expansion in a 
      mouse model of the fragile X-related disorders: implications for the mechanism of 
      repeat expansion.
PG  - 4985-94
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddu213 [doi]
AB  - The Fragile X-related disorders are X-linked disorders resulting from the 
      inheritance of FMR1 alleles with >54 CGG/CCG repeats in their 5' UTR. The repeats 
      expand both somatically and on intergenerational transmission and increased 
      repeat numbers are associated with increased risk of disease and increased risk 
      of further expansion. The mechanism responsible for expansion is unknown. Here, 
      we show in a knockin mouse model of these disorders that somatic expansion is 
      much less common in females than in males. We show that this is due in large part 
      to the fact that expansions occur only when the repeat is on the active X 
      chromosome. However, even when this is taken into account, expansions in females 
      are still less common than expected. This additional gender effect is not due to 
      a protective effect of estrogen, a deleterious effect of testosterone or to 
      differences in the expression of the Fmr1 gene or a variety of X-linked and 
      autosomal DNA repair genes. However, our data do suggest that a higher level of 
      expression of genes that protect against oxidative damage in females may 
      contribute to their lower levels of expansion. Whatever the basis, our data 
      suggest that the risk for somatic expansion may be lower in women than it is in 
      men. This could help explain the reduced penetrance of some aspects of disease 
      pathology in women. The fact that expansion only occurs when the Fmr1 allele is 
      on the active X chromosome has important implications for the mechanism of repeat 
      expansion.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a severe neurodegenerative 
      disorder that affects carriers of premutation CGG-repeat expansion alleles of the 
      fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene; current evidence supports a causal 
      role of the expanded CGG repeat within the FMR1 mRNA in the pathogenesis of 
      FXTAS. Though the mRNA has been observed to induce cellular toxicity in FXTAS, 
      the mechanisms are unclear. One common neurophysiological characteristic of FXTAS 
      patients is their inability to properly attenuate their response to an auditory 
      stimulus upon receipt of a small pre-stimulus. Therefore, to gain genetic and 
      cell biological insight into FXTAS, we examined the effect of expanded CGG 
      repeats on the plasticity of the olfactory response of the genetically tractable 
      nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). While C. elegans is innately 
      attracted to odors, this response can be downregulated if the odor is paired with 
      starvation. We found that expressing expanded CGG repeats in olfactory neurons 
      interfered with this plasticity without affecting either the innate odor-seeking 
      response or the olfactory neuronal morphology. Interrogation of three RNA 
      regulatory pathways indicated that the expanded CGG repeats act via the C. 
      elegans microRNA (miRNA)-specific Argonaute ALG-2 to diminish olfactory 
      plasticity. This observation suggests that the miRNA-Argonaute pathway may play a 
      pathogenic role in subverting neuronal function in FXTAS.

AB  - The human genome segment upstream of the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) 
      gene (Xq27.3) contains several genetic signals, among them is a DNA methylation 
      boundary that is located 65-70 CpGs upstream of the CGG repeat. In fragile X 
      syndrome (FXS), the boundary is lost, and the promoter is inactivated by 
      methylation spreading. Here we document boundary stability in spite of critical 
      expansions of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in male or female premutation carriers 
      and in high functioning males (HFMs). HFMs carry a full CGG repeat expansion but 
      exhibit an unmethylated promoter and lack the FXS phenotype. The boundary is also 
      stable in Turner (45, X) females. A CTCF-binding site is located slightly 
      upstream of the methylation boundary and carries a unique G-to-A polymorphism 
      (single nucleotide polymorphism), which occurs 3.6 times more frequently in 
      genomes with CGG expansions. The increased frequency of this single nucleotide 
      polymorphism might have functional significance. In CGG expansions, the CTCF 
      region does not harbor additional mutations. In FXS individuals and often in 
      cells transgenomic for EBV (Epstein Barr Virus) DNA or for the telomerase gene, 
      the large number of normally methylated CpGs in the far-upstream region of the 
      boundary is decreased about 4-fold. A methylation boundary is also present in the 
      human genome segment upstream of the HTT (huntingtin) promoter (4p16.3) and is 
      stable both in normal and Huntington disease chromosomes. Hence, the vicinity of 
      an expanded repeat does not per se compromise methylation boundaries. Methylation 
      boundaries exert an important function as promoter safeguards.

AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) and Fragile X syndrome (FXS) are among 40 diseases 
      associated with expansion of repeated sequences (TREDs). Although their molecular 
      pathology is not well understood, formation of repressive chromatin and unusual 
      DNA structures over repeat regions were proposed to play a role. Our study now 
      shows that RNA/DNA hybrids (R-loops) form in patient cells on expanded repeats of 
      endogenous FXN and FMR1 genes, associated with FRDA and FXS. These 
      transcription-dependent R-loops are stable, co-localise with repressive H3K9me2 
      chromatin mark and impede RNA Polymerase II transcription in patient cells. We 
      investigated the interplay between repressive chromatin marks and R-loops on the 
      FXN gene. We show that decrease in repressive H3K9me2 chromatin mark has no 
      effect on R-loop levels. Importantly, increasing R-loop levels by treatment with 
      DNA topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin leads to up-regulation of repressive 
      chromatin marks, resulting in FXN transcriptional silencing. This provides a 
      direct molecular link between R-loops and the pathology of TREDs, suggesting that 
      R-loops act as an initial trigger to promote FXN and FMR1 silencing. Thus R-loops 
      represent a common feature of nucleotide expansion disorders and provide a new 
      target for therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Folate-sensitive fragile sites (FSFS) are a rare cytogenetically visible subset 
      of dynamic mutations. Of the eight molecularly characterized FSFS, four are 
      associated with intellectual disability (ID). Cytogenetic expression results from 
      CGG tri-nucleotide-repeat expansion mutation associated with local CpG 
      hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing. The best studied is the FRAXA 
      site in the FMR1 gene, where large expansions cause fragile X syndrome, the most 
      common inherited ID syndrome. Here we studied three families with FRA2A 
      expression at 2q11 associated with a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental 
      phenotypes. We identified a polymorphic CGG repeat in a conserved, brain-active 
      alternative promoter of the AFF3 gene, an autosomal homolog of the X-linked 
      AFF2/FMR2 gene: Expansion of the AFF2 CGG repeat causes FRAXE ID. We found that 
      FRA2A-expressing individuals have mosaic expansions of the AFF3 CGG repeat in the 
      range of several hundred repeat units. Moreover, bisulfite sequencing and 
      pyrosequencing both suggest AFF3 promoter hypermethylation. cSNP-analysis 
      demonstrates monoallelic expression of the AFF3 gene in FRA2A carriers thus 
      predicting that FRA2A expression results in functional haploinsufficiency for 
      AFF3 at least in a subset of tissues. By whole-mount in situ hybridization the 
      mouse AFF3 ortholog shows strong regional expression in the developing brain, 
      somites and limb buds in 9.5-12.5dpc mouse embryos. Our data suggest that there 
      may be an association between FRA2A and a delay in the acquisition of motor and 
      language skills in the families studied here. However, additional cases are 
      required to firmly establish a causal relationship.

AB  - Expansion of a trinucleotide (CGG) repeat element within the 5' untranslated 
      region (5'UTR) of the human FMR1 gene is responsible for a number of heritable 
      disorders operating through distinct pathogenic mechanisms: gene silencing for 
      fragile X syndrome (>200 CGG) and RNA toxic gain-of-function for FXTAS ( approximately  55-200 
      CGG). Existing models have focused almost exclusively on post-transcriptional 
      mechanisms, but co-transcriptional processes could also contribute to the 
      molecular dysfunction of FMR1. We have observed that transcription through the 
      GC-rich FMR1 5'UTR region favors R-loop formation, with the nascent (G-rich) RNA 
      forming a stable RNA:DNA hybrid with the template DNA strand, thereby displacing 
      the non-template DNA strand. Using DNA:RNA (hybrid) immunoprecipitation (DRIP) of 
      genomic DNA from cultured human dermal fibroblasts with both normal ( approximately  30 CGG 
      repeats) and premutation (55<CGG<200 repeats) alleles, we provide evidence for 
      FMR1 R-loop formation in human genomic DNA. Using a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible 
      episomal system in which both the CGG-repeat and transcription frequency can be 
      varied, we further show that R-loop formation increases with higher expression 
      levels. Finally, non-denaturing bisulfite mapping of the displaced 
      single-stranded DNA confirmed R-loop formation at the endogenous FMR1 locus and 
      further indicated that R-loops formed over CGG repeats may be prone to structural 
      complexities, including hairpin formation, not commonly associated with other 
      R-loops. These observations introduce a new molecular feature of the FMR1 gene 
      that is directly affected by CGG-repeat expansion and is likely to be involved in 
      the associated cellular dysfunction.

LID - e94475
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased rates of autoinflammatory and autoimmune disorders have 
      been observed in female premutation carriers of CGG repeat expansion alleles of 
      between 55-200 repeats in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. To 
      determine whether an abnormal immune profile was present at a cellular level that 
      may predispose female carriers to autoinflammatory conditions, we investigated 
      dynamic cytokine production following stimulation of blood cells. In addition, 
      splenocyte responses were examined in an FMR1 CGG knock-in mouse model of the 
      fragile X premutation. METHODS: Human monocyte and peripheral blood leukocytes 
      (PBLs) were isolated from the blood of 36 female FMR1 premutation carriers and 15 
      age-matched controls. Cells were cultured with media alone, LPS or PHA. In the 
      animal model, splenocytes were isolated from 32 CGG knock-in mice and 32 wild 
      type littermates. Splenocytes were cultured with media alone or LPS or 
      PMA/Ionomycin. Concentrations of cytokines (GM-CSF, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, 
      IL-17, IFNgamma, TNFalpha, and MCP-1) were determined from the supernatants of cellular 
      cultures via Luminex multiplex assay. Additionally, phenotypic cellular markers 
      were assessed on cells isolated from human subjects via flow cytometry. RESULTS: 
      We found decreases in cytokine production in human premutation carriers as well 
      as in the FMR1 knock-in mice when compared with controls. Levels of cytokines 
      were found to be associated with CGG repeat length in both human and mouse. 
      Furthermore, T cells from human premutation carriers showed decreases in cell 
      surface markers of activation when compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      study, FMR1 CGG repeat expansions are associated with decreased immune responses 
      and immune dysregulation in both humans and mice. Deficits in immune responses in 
      female premutation carriers may lead to increased susceptibility to autoimmunity 
      and further research is warranted to determine the link between FMR1 CGG repeat 
      lengths and onset of autoinflammatory conditions.

TI  - Microdeletions including FMR1 in three female patients with intellectual 
      disability - further delineation of the phenotype and expression studies.
PG  - 65-75
LID - 10.1159/000357962 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is one of the most common causes of intellectual 
      disability/developmental delay (ID/DD), especially in males. It is caused most 
      often by CGG trinucleotide repeat expansions, and less frequently by point 
      mutations and partial or full deletions of the FMR1 gene. The wide clinical 
      spectrum of affected females partly depends on their X-inactivation status. Only 
      few female ID/DD patients with microdeletions including FMR1 have been reported. 
      We describe 3 female patients with 3.5-, 4.2- and 9.2-Mb de novo microdeletions 
      in Xq27.3-q28 containing FMR1. X-inactivation was random in all patients, yet 
      they presented with ID/DD as well as speech delay, macrocephaly and other 
      features attributable to FXS. No signs of autism were present. Here, we further 
      delineate the clinical spectrum of female patients with microdeletions. FMR1 
      expression studies gave no evidence for an absolute threshold below which signs 
      of FXS present. Since FMR1 expression is known to be highly variable between 
      unrelated females, and since FMR1 mRNA levels have been suggested to be more 
      similar among family members, we further explored the possibility of an 
      intrafamilial effect. Interestingly, FMR1 mRNA levels in all 3 patients were 
      significantly lower than in their respective mothers, which was shown to be 
      specific for patients with microdeletions containing FMR1.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common inherited cause of intellectual disability 
      that results from a CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene. Large repeat 
      expansions trigger both transcriptional and translational suppression of Fragile 
      X protein (FMRP) production. Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) 
      is an allelic neurodegenerative disease caused by smaller "pre-mutation" CGG 
      repeat expansions that enhance FMR1 transcription but lead to translational 
      inefficiency and reduced FMRP expression in animal models. Sensorimotor gating as 
      measured by pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) is altered in both FXS patients and Fmr1 
      knock out (KO) mice. Similarly, FXTAS patients have demonstrated PPI deficits. 
      Recent work suggests there may be overlapping synaptic defects between Fmr1 KO 
      and CGG knock-in premutation mouse models (CGG KI). We therefore sought to 
      interrogate PPI in CGG KI mice. Using a quiet PPI protocol more akin to human 
      testing conditions, we find that Fmr1 KO animals have significantly impaired PPI. 
      Using this same protocol, we find CGG KI mice demonstrate an age-dependent 
      impairment in PPI compared to wild type (WT) controls. This study describes a 
      novel phenotype in CGG KI mice that can be used in future therapeutic development 
      targeting premutation associated symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited intellectual 
      disability, is caused by expansion of CGG trinucleotide repeat at the 5' 
      untranslated region of the FMR1 gene at Xq27. In affected individuals, the CGG 
      repeat expansion leads to hypermethylation and the gene is transcriptionally 
      inactive. Our aim was to identify fragile X syndrome among children with 
      intellectual disability in Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 
      63 patients (53 males, 10 females) presented with intellectual disability, 29 
      normal subjects, and 23 other family members. DNA samples from six patients 
      previously diagnosed with fragile X syndrome by Southern blot technique were used 
      as positive controls. The method was based on bisulfite treatment of DNA followed 
      by two different techniques. The first technique applied polymerase chain 
      reaction amplification using one set of primers specific for amplifying 
      methylated CpG dinucleotide region; another set designed to amplify the 
      unmethylated CGG repeats. The second technique used the methylation-specific 
      melting curve analysis for detection of methylation status of the FMR1 promoter 
      region. RESULTS: Molecular testing using methylation sensitive polymerase chain 
      reaction had shown amplified products in all normal subjects using unmethylated 
      but not methylated primers indicating normal alleles, whereas amplified products 
      were obtained using methylated polymerase chain reaction primers in fragile X 
      syndrome-positive samples and in 9 of 53 males, indicating affected individuals. 
      Molecular testing using melting curve analysis has shown a single low melting 
      peak in all normal males and in (44/53) patients indicating unmethylated FMR1 
      gene, whereas high melting peak indicating methylated gene was observed in the 
      fragile X syndrome-positive samples and in 9 of 53 patients. We found 100% 
      concordance between results of both techniques and the results of Southern blot 
      analysis. Three samples have shown both methylated and unmethylated alleles, 
      indicating possible mosaicism. No female patients or carriers could be detected 
      by both techniques. CONCLUSION: The technique can be applied for the rapid 
      screening for fragile X syndrome among patients with intellectual disability. The 
      impact of mosaicism on clinical severity needs further investigation.

LID - 10.1126/science.1245831 [doi]
AB  - Epigenetic gene silencing is seen in several repeat-expansion diseases. In 
      fragile X syndrome, the most common genetic form of mental retardation, a CGG 
      trinucleotide-repeat expansion adjacent to the fragile X mental retardation 1 
      (FMR1) gene promoter results in its epigenetic silencing. Here, we show that FMR1 
      silencing is mediated by the FMR1 mRNA. The FMR1 mRNA contains the transcribed 
      CGG-repeat tract as part of the 5' untranslated region, which hybridizes to the 
      complementary CGG-repeat portion of the FMR1 gene to form an RNA.DNA duplex. 
      Disrupting the interaction of the mRNA with the CGG-repeat portion of the FMR1 
      gene prevents promoter silencing. Thus, our data link trinucleotide-repeat 
      expansion to a form of RNA-directed gene silencing mediated by direct 
      interactions of the trinucleotide-repeat RNA and DNA.

AB  - Previous studies have examined DNA methylation in different trinucleotide repeat 
      diseases. We have combined this data and used a pattern searching algorithm to 
      identify motifs in the DNA surrounding aberrantly methylated CpGs found in the 
      DNA of patients with one of the three trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansion 
      diseases: fragile X syndrome (FRAXA), myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1), or 
      Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). We examined sequences surrounding both the variably 
      methylated (VM) CpGs, which are hypermethylated in patients compared with 
      unaffected controls, and the nonvariably methylated CpGs which remain either 
      always methylated (AM) or never methylated (NM) in both patients and controls. 
      Using the J48 algorithm of WEKA analysis, we identified that two patterns are all 
      that is necessary to classify our three regions CCGG * which is found in VM and 
      not in AM regions and AATT * which distinguished between NM and VM + AM using 
      proportional frequency. Furthermore, comparing our software with MEME software, 
      we have demonstrated that our software identifies more patterns than MEME in 
      these short DNA sequences. Thus, we present evidence that the DNA sequence 
      surrounding CpG can influence its susceptibility to be de novo methylated in a 
      disease state associated with a trinucleotide repeat.

TI  - Fragile X syndrome due to a missense mutation.
PG  - 1185-9
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2013.311 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is a common inherited form of intellectual disability and 
      autism spectrum disorder. Most patients exhibit a massive CGG-repeat expansion 
      mutation in the FMR1 gene that silences the locus. In over two decades since the 
      discovery of FMR1, only a single missense mutation (p.(Ile304Asn)) has been 
      reported as causing fragile X syndrome. Here we describe a 16-year-old male 
      presenting with fragile X syndrome but without the repeat expansion mutation. 
      Rather, we find a missense mutation, c.797G>A, that replaces glycine 266 with 
      glutamic acid (p.(Gly266Glu)). The Gly266Glu FMR protein abolished many 
      functional properties of the protein. This patient highlights the diagnostic 
      utility of FMR1 sequencing.

AB  - There is evidence which demonstrates that a subset of males with a premutation 
      CGG repeat expansion (between 55 and 200 repeats) of the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 gene exhibit subtle deficits of executive function that 
      progressively deteriorate with increasing age and CGG repeat length. However, it 
      remains unclear whether similar deficits, which may indicate the onset of more 
      severe degeneration, are evident in female PM-carriers. In the present study we 
      explore whether female PM-carriers exhibit deficits of executive function which 
      parallel those of male PM-carriers. Fourteen female fragile X premutation 
      carriers without fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome and fourteen age, 
      sex, and IQ matched controls underwent ocular motor and neuropsychological tests 
      of select executive processes, specifically of response inhibition and working 
      memory. Group comparisons revealed poorer inhibitory control for female 
      premutation carriers on ocular motor tasks, in addition to demonstrating some 
      difficulties in behaviour self-regulation, when compared to controls. A negative 
      correlation between CGG repeat length and antisaccade error rates for premutation 
      carriers was also found. Our preliminary findings indicate that impaired 
      inhibitory control may represent a phenotype characteristic which may be a 
      sensitive risk biomarker within this female fragile X premutation population.

TI  - Gender and cell-type-specific effects of the transcription-coupled repair 
      protein, ERCC6/CSB, on repeat expansion in a mouse model of the fragile X-related 
      disorders.
PG  - 341-9
AB  - The repeat expansion diseases are human genetic disorders that arise from the 
      expansion of a tandem-repeat tract. The Fragile X-related disorders are members 
      of this disease group in which the repeat unit is CGG/CCG and is located in the 
      5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. Affected individuals often show 
      mosaicism with respect to repeat number resulting from both expansion and 
      contraction of the repeat tract; however, the mechanism responsible for these 
      changes in repeat number is unknown. The work from a variety of model systems 
      suggests that transcription-coupled repair (TCR) may contribute to repeat 
      instability in diseases resulting from CAG/CTG-repeat expansion. To test whether 
      TCR could contribute to repeat instability in the Fragile X-related disorders, we 
      tested the effect of mutations in Csb (Cockayne syndrome group B), a gene 
      essential for TCR, in a knock-in mouse model of these disorders. We found that 
      the loss of CSB affects expansions in a gender and cell-type-specific manner. Our 
      data also show an unanticipated gender difference in instability even in Csb+/+ 
      animals that may have implications for our understanding of the mechanism of 
      repeat expansion in the FX mouse model and perhaps for humans as well.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene 
      that appears to occur during oogenesis and during early embryogenesis. One model 
      proposes that repeat instability depends on the replication fork direction 
      through the repeats such that (CNG)n hairpin-like structures form, causing DNA 
      polymerase to stall and slip. Examining DNA replication fork progression on 
      single DNA molecules at the endogenous FMR1 locus revealed that replication forks 
      stall at CGG repeats in human cells. Furthermore, replication profiles of FXS 
      human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) compared to nonaffected hESCs showed that fork 
      direction through the repeats is altered at the FMR1 locus in FXS hESCs, such 
      that predominantly the CCG strand serves as the lagging-strand template. This is 
      due to the absence of replication initiation that would typically occur upstream 
      of FMR1, suggesting that altered replication origin usage combined with fork 
      stalling promotes repeat instability during early embryonic development.

LID - 10.1261/rna.041442.113 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental impairment in 
      humans, is caused by the absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein 
      (FMRP) due to a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5'-untranslated region 
      (UTR) and subsequent translational silencing of the fragile x mental 
      retardation-1 (FMR1) gene. FMRP, which is proposed to be involved in the 
      translational regulation of specific neuronal messenger RNA (mRNA) targets, 
      contains an arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) box RNA binding domain that has been 
      shown to bind with high affinity to G-quadruplex forming mRNA structures. FMRP 
      undergoes alternative splicing, and the binding of FMRP to a proposed 
      G-quadruplex structure in the coding region of its mRNA (named FBS) has been 
      proposed to affect the mRNA splicing events at exon 15. In this study, we used 
      biophysical methods to directly demonstrate the folding of FMR1 FBS into a 
      secondary structure that contains two specific G-quadruplexes and analyze its 
      interactions with several FMRP isoforms. Our results show that minor splice 
      isoforms, ISO2 and ISO3, created by the usage of the second and third acceptor 
      sites at exon 15, bind with higher affinity to FBS than FMRP ISO1, which is 
      created by the usage of the first acceptor site. FMRP ISO2 and ISO3 cannot 
      undergo phosphorylation, an FMRP post-translational modification shown to 
      modulate the protein translation regulation. Thus, their expression has to be 
      tightly regulated, and this might be accomplished by a feedback mechanism 
      involving the FMRP interactions with the G-quadruplex structures formed within 
      FMR1 mRNA.

TI  - The mismatch repair protein MSH2 is rate limiting for repeat expansion in a

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor and ataxia syndrome, Fragile X-associated primary 
      ovarian insufficiency, and Fragile X syndrome are Repeat Expansion Diseases 
      caused by expansion of a CGG*CCG-repeat microsatellite in the 5 UTR of the FMR1 
      gene. To help understand the expansion mechanism responsible for these disorders, 
      we have crossed mice containing approximately 147 CGG*CCG repeats in the endogenous murine Fmr1 
      gene with mice containing a null mutation in the gene encoding the mismatch 
      repair protein MSH2. MSH2 mutations are associated with elevated levels of 
      generalized microsatellite instability. However, we show here for the first time 
      that in the FX mouse model, all maternally and paternally transmitted expansions 
      require Msh2. Even the loss of one Msh2 allele reduced the intergenerational 
      expansion frequency significantly. Msh2 is also required for all somatic 
      expansions and loss of even one functional Msh2 allele reduced the extent of 
      somatic expansion in some organs. Tissues with lower levels of MSH2 were more 
      sensitive to the loss of a single Msh2 allele. This suggests that MSH2 is rate 
      limiting for expansion in this mouse model and that MSH2 levels may be a key 
      factor that accounts for tissue-specific differences in expansion risk.

TI  - Mosaicism for FMR1 gene full mutation and intermediate allele in a female foetus: 
      a postzygotic retraction event.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome is caused by the expansion of an unstable CGG repeat in the 
      5'UTR of FMR1 gene. The occurrence of mosaicism is not uncommon, especially in 
      male patients, whereas in females it is not so often reported. Here we report a 
      female foetus that was subject to prenatal diagnosis, because of her mother being 
      a premutation carrier. The foetus was identified as being a mosaic for an 
      intermediate allele and a full mutation of FMR1 gene, in the presence of a normal 
      allele. The mosaic status was confirmed in three different tissues of the 
      foetus--amniotic fluid, skin biopsy and blood--the last two obtained after 
      pregnancy termination. Karyotype analysis and X-chromosome STR markers analysis 
      do not support the mosaicism as inheritance of both maternal alleles. 
      Oligonucleotide array-CGH excluded an imbalance that could contain the primer 
      binding site with a different repeat size. The obtained results give compelling 
      evidence for a postzygotic expansion mechanism where the foetus mosaic pattern 
      originated from expansion of the mother's premutation into a full mutation and 
      consequent regression to an intermediate allele in a proportion of cells. These 
      events occurred in early embryogenesis before the commitment of cells into the 
      different tissues, as the three tested tissues of the foetus have the same mosaic 
      pattern. The couple has a son with Fragile X mental retardation syndrome and 
      choose to terminate this pregnancy after genetic counselling.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome, the leading inherited cause of mental retardation and autism 
      spectrum disorders worldwide, is caused by a tandem repeat expansion in the FMR1 
      (fragile X mental retardation 1) gene. It presents with a distinct behavioral 
      phenotype which overlaps significantly with that of autism. Emerging evidence 
      suggests that tandem repeat polymorphisms (TRPs) might also play a key role in 
      modulating disease susceptibility for a range of common polygenic disorders, 
      including the broader autism spectrum of disorders (ASD) and other forms of 
      psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder [1]. 
      In order to understand how TRPs and associated gene mutations mediate 
      pathogenesis, various mouse models have been generated. A crucial step in such 
      functional genomics is high-quality behavioral and cognitive phenotyping. This 
      chapter presents a basic behavioral battery for standardized tests for assaying 
      social phenotypes in mouse models of brain disorders, with a focus on aggression.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) results from a CGG repeat 
      expansion in the 5' UTR of FMR1. This repeat is thought to elicit toxicity as 
      RNA, yet disease brains contain ubiquitin-positive neuronal inclusions, a 
      pathologic hallmark of protein-mediated neurodegeneration. We explain this 
      paradox by demonstrating that CGG repeats trigger repeat-associated 
      non-AUG-initiated (RAN) translation of a cryptic polyglycine-containing protein, 
      FMRpolyG. FMRpolyG accumulates in ubiquitin-positive inclusions in Drosophila, 
      cell culture, mouse disease models, and FXTAS patient brains. CGG RAN translation 
      occurs in at least two of three possible reading frames at repeat sizes ranging 
      from normal (25) to pathogenic (90), but inclusion formation only occurs with 
      expanded repeats. In Drosophila, CGG repeat toxicity is suppressed by eliminating 
      RAN translation and enhanced by increased polyglycine protein production. These 
      studies expand the growing list of nucleotide repeat disorders in which RAN 
      translation occurs and provide evidence that RAN translation contributes to 
      neurodegeneration.

AB  - The human X chromosome carries regions prone to genomic instability: deletions in 
      the Xp22.31 region, involving the steroid sulfatase gene (STS) cause X-linked 
      ichthyosis; rearrangements in the Xp21.2 region are associated with Duchenne or 
      Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD or BMD); and the Xq27.3 unstable region, 
      containing the (CGG)n repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene is associated with 
      fragile X syndrome. We report on a family with two affected boys, the elder 
      diagnosed with fragile X syndrome, the younger with DMD, and both suffering from 
      severe ichthyosis. The family was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction, 
      multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and haplotype analysis. The 
      mother proved to be an asymptomatic carrier of all three non-contiguous mutation 
      events, involving the STS gene, the DMD gene and a FMR1 expansion. To the best of 
      our knowledge, this is the first description of an asymptomatic carrier of three 
      different X-linked disorders, involving severe genetic rearrangements on both 
      long and short arms of the X chromosomes. The boy with fragile X syndrome has 
      inherited a triple recombinant maternal X chromosome, this way inheriting the 
      FMR1 expansion and ichthyosis, originating most probably from different maternal 
      Xes and excluding the DMD gene deletion. The transmission of these extremely 
      defective maternal chromosomes to the next generation involved several 
      recombinations.

PG  - 13831-41
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M112.441055 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: FMR1 CGG expansion repeats in the premutation range have not been 
      linked to astrocyte pathophysiology. RESULTS: Premutation cortical astrocytes 
      display decreased Glu transporter expression/activity and enhanced asynchronous 
      Ca(2+) oscillations. CONCLUSION: Glu transport and Ca(2+) signaling defects in 
      premutation astrocytes could contribute to FXTAS neuropathology. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Premutation astrocytes may have an etiological role in FXTAS neuropathology. 
      Premutation CGG repeat expansions (55-200 CGG repeats; preCGG) within the fragile 
      X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene can cause fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome. Defects in early neuronal migration and morphology, 
      electrophysiological activity, and mitochondria trafficking have been described 
      in a premutation mouse model, but whether preCGG mutations also affect astrocyte 
      function remains unknown. PreCGG cortical astrocytes ( approximately 170 CGG repeats) displayed 
      3-fold higher Fmr1 mRNA and 30% lower FMR1 protein (FMRP) when compared with WT. 
      PreCGG astrocytes showed modest reductions in expression of glutamate (Glu) 
      transporters GLT-1 and GLAST and attenuated Glu uptake (p < 0.01). Consistent 
      with astrocyte cultures in vitro, aged preCGG mice cerebral cortex also displayed 
      reduced GLAST and GLT-1 expression. Approximately 65% of the WT and preCGG 
      cortical astrocytes displayed spontaneous asynchronous Ca(2+) oscillations. 
      PreCGG astrocytes exhibited nearly 50% higher frequency of asynchronous Ca(2+) 
      oscillations (p < 0.01) than WT, a difference mimicked by chronic exposure of WT 
      astrocytes to l-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (l-trans-PDC) or by 
      partial suppression of GLAST using siRNA interference. Acute challenge with Glu 
      augmented the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillations in both genotypes. Additionally, 
      10 mum Glu elicited a sustained intracellular Ca(2+) rise in a higher portion of 
      preCGG astrocytes when compared with WT. Pharmacological studies showed that 
      mGluR5, but not NMDA receptor, contributed to Glu hypersensitivity in preCGG 
      astrocytes. These functional defects in preCGG astrocytes, especially in Glu 
      signaling, may contribute to fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      neuropathology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and its associated disorders are caused by 
      the expansion of the CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the fragile X 
      mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, with disease classification based on the number 
      of CGG repeats. The mechanisms of repeat expansion are dependent on the presence 
      of cis elements and the absence of trans factors both of which are not mutually 
      exclusive and contribute to repeat instability. Expansions associated with trans 
      factors are due to the haploinsuffient or reduced expression of several DNA 
      repair/metabolizing proteins. The reduction of expression in trans factors has 
      been primarily conducted in animal models without substantial examination of many 
      of these expansion mechanisms and trans factors in humans. RESULTS: To understand 
      the trans factors and pathways associated with trinucleotide repeat expansion we 
      have analyzed two microarray datasets which characterized the transcript 
      expression in patients with FXS and in controls. CONCLUSION: We observed 
      significant down regulation of DNA damage/repair pathway transcripts. This 
      observation was consistent in both datasets, which used different populations. 
      Within these datasets, several transcripts overlapped in the direction of 
      association and fold change. Further characterization of these genes will be 
      critical to understand their role in trinucleotide repeat instability in FXS.

TI  - Impaired activity-dependent FMRP translation and enhanced mGluR-dependent LTD in 
      Fragile X premutation mice.
PG  - 1180-92
LID - 10.1093/hmg/dds525 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X premutation-associated disorders, including Fragile X-associated Tremor 
      Ataxia Syndrome, result from unmethylated CGG repeat expansions in the 5' 
      untranslated region (UTR) of the FMR1 gene. Premutation-sized repeats increase 
      FMR1 transcription but impair rapid translation of the Fragile X mental 
      retardation protein (FMRP), which is absent in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). 
      Normally, FMRP binds to RNA and regulates metabotropic glutamate receptor 
      (mGluR)-mediated synaptic translation, allowing for dendritic synthesis of 
      several proteins. FMRP itself is also synthesized at synapses in response to 
      mGluR activation. However, the role of activity-dependent translation of FMRP in 
      synaptic plasticity and Fragile X-premutation-associated disorders is unknown. To 
      investigate this question, we utilized a CGG knock-in mouse model of the Fragile 
      X premutation with 120-150 CGG repeats in the mouse Fmr1 5' UTR. These mice 
      exhibit increased Fmr1 mRNA production but impaired FMRP translational 
      efficiency, leading to a modest reduction in basal FMRP expression. Cultured 
      hippocampal neurons and synaptoneurosomes derived from CGG KI mice demonstrate 
      impaired FMRP translation in response to the group I mGluR agonist 
      3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine. Electrophysiological analysis reveals enhanced 
      mGluR-mediated long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) at CA3-CA1 synapses in acute 
      hippocampal slices prepared from CGG KI mice relative to wild-type littermates, 
      similar to Fmr1 knockout mice. However, unlike mGluR-LTD in mice completely 
      lacking FMRP, mGluR-LTD in CGG knock-in mice remains dependent on new protein 
      synthesis. These studies demonstrate partially overlapping synaptic plasticity 
      phenotypes in mouse models of FXS and Fragile X premutation disorders and support 
      a role for activity-dependent synthesis of FMRP in enduring forms of synaptic 
      plasticity.

AB  - We recently reported a significant increase in the frequency of carriers of grey 
      zone (GZ) alleles of FMR1 gene in Australian males with Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      from Victoria and Tasmania. Here, we report data comparing an independent sample 
      of 817 PD patients from Queensland to 1078 consecutive Australian male newborns 
      from Victoria. We confirmed the earlier finding by observing a significant excess 
      of GZ alleles in PD (4.8%) compared to controls (1.5%). Although both studies 
      provided evidence in support of an association between GZ-carrier status and 
      increased risk for parkinsonism, the existing evidence in the literature from 
      screening studies remains equivocal and we discuss the need for alternative 
      approaches to resolve the issue.

PG  - 600-13
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhs341 [doi]
AB  - Mutations of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are the genetic cause 
      of fragile X syndrome (FXS). The presence of significant socioemotional problems 
      has been well documented in FXS although the brain basis of those deficits 
      remains unspecified. Here, we investigated amygdala dysfunction and its relation 
      to socioemotional deficits and FMR1 gene expression in children and adolescents 
      on the FX spectrum (i.e., individuals whose trinucleotide CGG repeat expansion 
      from 55 to over 200 places them somewhere within the fragile X diagnostic range 
      from premutation to full mutation). Participants performed an fMRI task in which 
      they viewed fearful, happy, and scrambled faces. Neuroimaging results 
      demonstrated that FX participants revealed significantly attenuated amygdala 
      activation in Fearful > Scrambled and Fearful > Happy contrasts compared with 
      their neurotypical counterparts, while showing no differences in amygdala volume. 
      Furthermore, we found significant relationships between FMR1 gene expression, 
      anxiety/social dysfunction scores, and reduced amygdala activation in the FX 
      group. In conclusion, we report novel evidence regarding a dosage response of the 
      FMR1 gene on fear-specific functions of the amygdala, which is associated with 
      socioemotional deficits in FXS.

LID - 264
AB  - Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of X-linked intellectual 
      disability (ID), associated with a wide range of cognitive and behavioral 
      impairments. FXS is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene 
      located on the X-chromosome. FMR1 is expected to prevent the expression of the 
      "fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)", which results in altered 
      structural and functional development of the synapse, including a loss of 
      synaptic plasticity. This review aims to unveil the contribution of 
      electrophysiological signal studies for the understanding of the information 
      processing impairments in FXS patients. We discuss relevant event-related 
      potential (ERP) studies conducted with full mutation FXS patients and clinical 
      populations sharing symptoms with FXS in a developmental perspective. Specific 
      deviances found in FXS ERP profiles are described. Alterations are reported in 
      N1, P2, Mismatch Negativity (MMN), N2, and P3 components in FXS compared to 
      healthy controls. Particularly, deviances in N1 and P2 amplitude seem to be 
      specific to FXS. The presented results suggest a cascade of impaired information 
      processes that are in line with symptoms and anatomical findings in FXS.

AB  - Pre-mutation CGG repeat expansions (55-200 CGG repeats; pre-CGG) within the 
      fragile-X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene cause fragile-X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome in humans. Defects in neuronal morphology, early 
      migration, and electrophysiological activity have been described despite 
      appreciable expression of fragile-X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in a 
      pre-CGG knock-in (KI) mouse model. The triggers that initiate and promote pre-CGG 
      neuronal dysfunction are not understood. The absence of FMRP in a Drosophila 
      model of fragile-X syndrome was shown to increase axonal transport of 
      mitochondria. In this study, we show that dissociated hippocampal neuronal 
      culture from pre-CGG KI mice (average 170 CGG repeats) express 42.6% of the FMRP 
      levels and 3.8-fold higher Fmr1 mRNA than that measured in wild-type neurons at 4 
      days in vitro. Pre-CGG hippocampal neurons show abnormalities in the number, 
      mobility, and metabolic function of mitochondria at this early stage of 
      differentiation. Pre-CGG hippocampal neurites contained significantly fewer 
      mitochondria and greatly reduced mitochondria mobility. In addition, pre-CGG 
      neurons had higher rates of basal oxygen consumption and proton leak. We conclude 
      that deficits in mitochondrial trafficking and metabolic function occur despite 
      the presence of appreciable FMRP expression and may contribute to the early 
      pathophysiology in pre-CGG carriers and to the risk of developing clinical 
      fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome.

AB  - Repeat expansion diseases result from expansion of a specific tandem repeat. The 
      three fragile X-related disorders (FXDs) arise from germline expansions of a 
      CGG*CCG repeat tract in the 5' UTR (untranslated region) of the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. We show here that in addition to germline expansion, 
      expansion also occurs in the somatic cells of both mice and humans carriers of 
      premutation alleles. Expansion in mice primarily affects brain, testis, and liver 
      with very little expansion in heart or blood. Our data would be consistent with a 
      simple two-factor model for the organ specificity. Somatic expansion in humans 
      may contribute to the mosaicism often seen in individuals with one of the FXDs. 
      Because expansion risk and disease severity are related to repeat number, somatic 
      expansion may exacerbate disease severity and contribute to the age-related 
      increased risk of expansion seen on paternal transmission in humans. As little 
      somatic expansion occurs in murine lymphocytes, our data also raise the 
      possibility that there may be discordance in humans between repeat numbers 
      measured in blood and that present in brain. This could explain, at least in 
      part, the variable penetrance seen in some of these disorders.

AB  - The fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is an adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by CGG trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 
      fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. The neuropathological hallmark of 
      FXTAS is the presence of ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions in neurons 
      and in astroglia. Intranuclear inclusions have also been reported in the neurons 
      of male CGG KI mice carrying an expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat and used to 
      model FXTAS, but no study has been carried out quantifying inclusions in female 
      CGG KI mice heterozygous for the fragile X premutation. We used histologic and 
      immunocytochemical methods to determine the pathological features of intranuclear 
      inclusions in astroglia and neurons. In female CGG KI mice, ubiquitin-positive 
      intranuclear inclusions were found in neurons and astroglia throughout the brain 
      in cortical and subcortical regions. These inclusions increased in number and 
      became larger with advanced age and increasing CGG repeat length, supporting 
      hypotheses that these pathologic features are progressive across the lifespan. 
      The number of inclusions in neurons was reduced by  approximately 25% in female CGG KI mice 
      compared to male CGG KI mice, but not so low as the 50% predicted. These data 
      emphasize the need to evaluate the neurocognitive and pathological features in 
      female carriers of the fragile X premutation with and without FXTAS 
      symptomatology is warranted, as this population shows similar neuropathological 
      features present in male FXTAS patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Haplotypes formed by polymorphisms (T-786C, rs2070744; a variable 
      number of tandem repeats in intron 4, and Glu298Asp, rs1799983) of eNOS gene were 
      associated previously with gestational hypertension (GH) and preeclampsia (PE). 
      However, no study has explored the tagging SNPs rs743506 and rs7830 in these 
      disorders. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current study was to compare the 
      distribution of the genotypes and haplotypes formed by the two tagging SNPs or by 
      the five eNOS polymorphisms mentioned among healthy pregnant GH and PE. METHODS: 
      We recruited 122 HP, 138 GH and 157 PE. Genotypes for the T-786C, the Glu298Asp 
      and rs743506 polymorphisms were determined by Taqmana Allele Discrimination 
      assays and fluorescence signals were measured on Chromo 4 Detector (Bio-Rad 
      Laboratories, USA). Genotypes for the VNTR polymorphism in intron 4 and rs7830, 
      however, were determined by PCR and fragment separation by electrophoresis in 8% 
      polyacrylamide gels. Plasma aliquots were analyzed in triplicate for their 
      nitrite content using an ozone-based chemiluminescence assay. RESULTS: The 
      haplotype formed by the most common variants in each polymorphism "T b G A C" was 
      more frequent in PE group compared to HP (P=0.00004), which may be explained by 
      the higher linkage disequilibrium found in PE compared to GH and HP. Conversely, 
      the haplotype "C b G G C" was more frequent in HP compared to PE (P=0.00113), 
      which is supported by previous findings that demonstrated the association of the 
      combination "C b G" with higher level of nitrite (NO marker). CONCLUSION: Our 
      results suggest a protective effect of the haplotype "C b G G C" against the 
      development of PE. This study was funded by the Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do 
      Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG-Brazil), the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de 
      Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES), Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento

PG  - 2260-75
LID - 10.1002/hipo.22043 [doi]
AB  - The fragile X premutation is a CGG repeat expansion on the FMR1 gene between 55 
      and 200 repeats in length. It has been proposed that impaired spatiotemporal 
      function underlies cognitive deficits in genetic disorders, including the fragile 
      X premutation. This study characterized the role of the premutation for cognitive 
      function by demonstrating CGG KI mice with 70-198 CGG repeats show deficits 
      across tasks requiring spatial and temporal pattern separation. To elucidate 
      mechanisms whereby CGG repeats affect spatiotemporal processing, hippocampal 
      slices were evaluated for LTP, LTD, and mGluR1/5 LTD. Increasing CGG repeat 
      length modulated the induction of LTP, LTD, and mGluR1/5 LTD, as well as 
      behavioral tasks emphasizing spatiotemporal processing. Despite the deficits in 
      the induction of all forms of plasticity, there were no differences in expression 
      of plasticity once evoked. These data provide evidence for a neurocognitive 
      endophenotype in the CGG KI mouse model of the premutation in which CGG repeat 
      length negatively modulates plasticity and spatiotemporal attention.

AB  - The fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (Fmr1) is polymorphic for CGG 
      trinucleotide repeat number in the 5'-untranslated region, with repeat lengths 
      <45 associated with typical development and repeat lengths >200 resulting in 
      hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of the gene and mental retardation 
      in the fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Individuals with CGG repeat expansions between 
      55 and 200 are carriers of the fragile X premutation (PM). PM carriers show a 
      phenotype that can include anxiety, depression, social phobia, and memory 
      deficits. They are also at risk for developing fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome (FXTAS), a late onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
      tremor, ataxia, cognitive impairment, and neuropathologic features including 
      intranuclear inclusions in neurons and astrocytes, loss of Purkinje cells, and 
      white matter disease. However, very little is known about dendritic morphology in 
      PM or in FXTAS. Therefore, we carried out a Golgi study of dendritic complexity 
      and dendritic spine morphology in layer II/III pyramidal neurons in primary 
      visual cortex in a knock-in (KI) mouse model of the PM. These CGG KI mice carry 
      an expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat on Fmr1, and model many features of the PM 
      and FXTAS. Compared to wild-type (WT) mice, CGG KI mice showed fewer dendritic 
      branches proximal to the soma, reduced total dendritic length, and a higher 
      frequency of longer dendritic spines. The distribution of morphologic spine types 
      (e.g., stubby, mushroom, filopodial) did not differ between WT and KI mice. These 
      findings demonstrate that synaptic circuitry is abnormal in visual cortex of mice 
      used to model the PM, and suggest that such changes may underlie neurologic 
      features found in individuals carrying the PM as well as in individuals with 
      FXTAS.

AB  - Recently, repeat expansions in several genes have been shown to cause or be 
      associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It has been demonstrated 
      that an intronic hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is a major cause of 
      both familial (approximately 40%) and sporadic (approximately 5%) ALS, as well as 
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In addition, a CAG-repeat expansion in exon 1 of 
      ATXN2, otherwise known to cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, has been 
      identified as a major risk factor for sporadic ALS. Intermediate repeat 
      expansions in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene (55-200 repeats) are 
      known to cause fragile X-associated premature ovarian insufficiency [(FX)POI; 
      female carriers] or fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS; male 
      carriers) by CGG-mediated RNA toxicity. The present investigation involves 
      screening FMR1 repeat length in 742 sporadic ALS patients and 792 matched 
      controls. Our conclusion is that FMR1 repeat expansions are not associated with 
      ALS.

TI  - Reduced telomere length in individuals with FMR1 premutations and full mutations.
PG  - 1060-5
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.35275 [doi]
AB  - We reported previously that 10 older men (66.4 +/- 4.6 years) with premutation 
      alleles (55-200 CGG repeats) of the FMR1 gene, with or without FXTAS, had 
      decreased telomere length when compared to sex- and age-matched controls. 
      Extending our use of light intensity measurements from a telomere probe 
      hybridized to interphase preparations, we have now found shortened telomeres in 9 
      younger male premutation carriers (31.7 +/- 17.6 years). We have also shown 
      decreased telomere length in T lymphocytes from 6 male individuals (12.0 +/- 1.8 
      years) with full mutation FMR1 alleles (>200 CGG repeats). These findings support 
      our hypothesis that reduced telomere length is a component of the sub-cellular 
      pathology of FMR1-associated disorders. The experimental approach involved 
      pair-wise comparisons of light intensity values of 20 cells from an individual 
      with either premutation or full mutation CGG-repeat expansions relative to an 
      equivalent number of cells from a sex- and age-matched control. In addition, we 
      demonstrated reduced telomere size in T-lymphocyte cultures from eight 
      individuals with the FMR1 premutation using six different measures. Four relied 
      on detection of light intensity differences, and two involved measuring the whole 
      chromosome, including the telomere, in microns. This new approach confirmed our 
      findings with light intensity measurements and demonstrated the feasibility of 
      direct linear measurements for detecting reductions in telomere size. We have 
      thus confirmed our hypothesis that reduced telomere length is associated with 
      both premutation and full mutation-FMR1 alleles and have demonstrated that direct 
      measurements of telomere length can reliably detect such reductions.

      allopregnanolone.
PG  - 2923-35
LID - 10.1093/hmg/dds118 [doi]
AB  - Premutation CGG repeat expansions (55-200 CGG repeats; preCGG) within the fragile 
      X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene cause fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome (FXTAS). Defects in neuronal morphology and migration have been 
      described in a preCGG mouse model. Mouse preCGG hippocampal neurons (170 CGG 
      repeats) grown in vitro develop abnormal networks of clustered burst (CB) firing, 
      as assessed by multielectrode array recordings and clustered patterns of 
      spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations, neither typical of wild-type (WT) neurons. 
      PreCGG neurons have reduced expression of vesicular GABA and glutamate (Glu) 
      transporters (VGAT and VGLUT1, respectively), and preCGG hippocampal astrocytes 
      display a rightward shift on Glu uptake kinetics, compared with WT. These 
      alterations in preCGG astrocytes and neurons are associated with 4- to 8-fold 
      elevated Fmr1 mRNA and occur despite consistent expression of fragile X mental 
      retardation protein levels at  approximately 50% of WT levels. Abnormal patterns of activity 
      observed in preCGG neurons are pharmacologically mimicked in WT neurons by 
      addition of Glu or the mGluR1/5 agonist, dihydroxyphenylglycine, to the medium, 
      or by inhibition of astrocytic Glu uptake with dl-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartic acid, 
      but not by the ionotropic Glu receptor agonists, 
      alpha-2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2-oxazol-4-yl) propanoic acid or 
      N-methyl-d-aspartic acid. The mGluR1 (7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa 
      [b]chromen-1a-carboxylate ethyl ester) or mGluR5 
      (2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride) antagonists reversed CB 
      firing. Importantly, the acute addition of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone 
      mitigated functional impairments observed in preCGG neurons in a reversible 
      manner. These results demonstrate abnormal mGluR1/5 signaling in preCGG neurons, 
      which is ameliorated by mGluR1/5 antagonists or augmentation of GABA(A) receptor 
      signaling, and identify allopregnanolone as a candidate therapeutic lead.

PG  - 672-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2012.07722.x [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a developmental disorder caused by the loss of 
      Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene function because of a CGG repeat 
      expansion (> 200 repeats) in the gene. The molecular mechanism(s) linking loss of 
      FMR1 function to the molecular pathology and cognitive/behavioral disability 
      remain unclear. Given the critical role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 
      (ERK) in synaptic plasticity and neurodevelopment, a number of recent studies 
      have investigated ERK phosphorylation under basal conditions or upon 
      mGluR-induction using neuronal and peripheral tissues from Fmr1 knockout mice and 
      peripheral tissues from FXS patients. However, these reports have presented 
      conflicting results. The current study is the first to focus on the levels of ERK 
      phosphorylation in brain tissue from human FXS patients. In both human brain 
      tissue and brain tissue from Fmr1 knockout mice there was significantly increased 
      phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK. Indeed, treating Fmr1 knockout mice with the 
      MEK1/2 inhibitor SL327 abrogated audiogenic seizure activity, a feature of the 
      Fmr1 knockout mice that replicates the symptom in patients with FXS. These 
      findings suggest that activation of the ERK pathway results in some cardinal 
      cognitive and clinical features in FXS patients and likely have profound 
      translational implications.

TI  - Screening for FMR1 expanded alleles in patients with parkinsonism in mainland 
      China.
PG  - 16-21
LID - 10.1016/j.neulet.2012.02.036 [doi]
AB  - Expanded alleles of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are generally 
      divided into four classes based on the abundance of unstable CGG repeat 
      expansions (CGGs) in its 5'-untranslated region. It has recently been reported 
      that two of the four classes, premutation (55-200 CGGs) and gray zone (GZ, 40-54 
      CGGs) alleles, was potentially associated with parkinsonism. To investigate this 
      association in patients in mainland China, a total of 360 Chinese patients with 
      parkinsonism and 295 gender and age matched controls were recruited in this 
      study. Indeed, no premutation or full mutation alleles (>200 CGGs) was detected 
      among all the subjects. A total of 11 patients with parkinsonism were identified 
      to have GZ alleles compared with only 1 carrier among the controls (P<0.05). 
      Notably, 10 of the 11 GZ alleles carriers with parkinsonism were female, which 
      was 6.8% of all 147 female patients compared with none in the control females 
      (P<0.05). No significant difference was detected between the male groups of 
      patients and controls. Therefore, our results indicate that FMR1 GZ allele is 
      potentially associated with parkinsonism in mainland China, and the association 
      is only present in the female patients, but not in the male.

TI  - Molecular genetic testing for fragile X syndrome: laboratory performance on the 
      College of American Pathologists proficiency surveys (2001-2009).
PG  - 306-12

AB  - PURPOSE: The College of American Pathologists offers biannual proficiency testing 
      for molecular analysis of fragile X syndrome. The purpose of this study was to 
      analyze laboratory performance on the fragile X proficiency surveys from 2001 to 
      2009. METHODS: Individual laboratory responses were analyzed for accuracy of 
      genotype determination (normal, gray zone, premutation, or full mutation) and 
      size analysis of the FMR1 trinucleotide repeat region. The analytical sensitivity 
      and specificity of testing for fragile X were calculated, and laboratory 
      performance for trinucleotide repeat sizing was evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, 
      laboratories demonstrated analytical sensitivity of 99% and 96% for detection of 
      full mutations associated with fragile X syndrome in males and females, 
      respectively; analytical sensitivity of 98% for detection of premutations; and 
      analytical specificity of 99.9%. Size measurements of the CGG repeat region were 
      acceptable from most laboratories, with an increase in the range of reported 
      sizes observed for larger repeat expansions. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular genetic 
      testing for fragile X syndrome demonstrated excellent sensitivity and specificity 
      by laboratories participating in the College of American Pathologists (CAP) 
      surveys. Allele sizing demonstrated good performance overall with improved 
      accuracy over the study period. Participation in proficiency testing can aid 
      laboratories in assessing individual performance and need for calibration of 
      assays.

AB  - AIMS: Most individuals with intellectual disability and/or autism are tested for 
      Fragile X syndrome at some point in their lifetime. Greater than 99% of 
      individuals with Fragile X have an expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat motif in the 
      promoter region of the FMR1 gene, and diagnostic testing involves determining the 
      size of the CGG repeat as well as methylation status when an expansion is 
      present. RESULTS: Using a previously described triplet repeat-primed polymerase 
      chain reaction, we have performed additional validation studies using two cohorts 
      with previous diagnostic testing results available for comparison purposes. The 
      first cohort (n=88) consisted of both males and females and had a high percentage 
      of abnormal samples, while the second cohort (n=624) consisted of only females 
      and was not enriched for expansion mutations. Data from each cohort were 
      completely concordant with the results previously obtained during the course of 
      diagnostic testing. CONCLUSIONS: This study further demonstrates the utility of 
      using laboratory-developed triplet repeat-primed FMR1 testing in a clinical 
      setting.

TI  - Screening for CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene by melting curve analysis of 
      combined 5' and 3' direct triplet-primed PCRs.
PG  - 568-79
LID - 10.1373/clinchem.2011.174615 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: CGG repeat expansions in the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) 
      gene are associated with fragile X syndrome, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome, and fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency. We evaluated 
      the use of melting curve analysis (MCA) of triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) assays as 
      a rapid screening tool for the positive identification of expanded FMR1 alleles 
      in men and women. METHODS: Both 5'- and 3'-weighted direct TP-PCRs (dTP-PCRs) 
      were evaluated on 29 cell line-derived DNA samples and 44 blinded clinical 
      samples. The presence of expansions was identified by the melting curve profiles 
      generated automatically through MCA on the LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System. 
      All samples were also analyzed by capillary electrophoresis to confirm the 
      identities of the PCR fragments that gave rise to the observed melt peak 
      profiles. RESULTS: The presence of expanded alleles in samples from both males 
      and females produced melt peak profiles that were distinct from those of 
      individuals with the normal allelic form. In the blinded test, positive and 
      negative calls for the presence of an expanded allele corroborated with 
      previously determined genotype classifications for all samples. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      approach of dTP-PCR plus MCA offers a single-step strategy with high diagnostic 
      sensitivity and specificity for rapid screening detection of FMR1 CGG repeat 
      expansions, regardless of sex. The combined use of 5'- and 3'-weighted dTP-PCR 
      assays minimizes the incidence of false-negative results arising from 
      repeat-flanking deletions.

TI  - FOXE1 polyalanine tract length screening by MLPA in idiopathic premature ovarian 
      failure.
PG  - 158
LID - 10.1186/1477-7827-9-158 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: FOXE1 is one of the candidate genes for genetic predisposition to 
      premature ovarian failure (POF) and it contains an alanine tract. Our purpose is 
      to assess the influence of length of the alanine tract of FOXE1 on genetic 
      susceptibility to POF. METHODS: The group studied consisted of 110 Chinese 
      patients with idiopathic POF and 110 women from normal controls. The polyalanine 
      tract and flanking sequence of FOXE1 was screened using the Multiple 
      Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) technique and directly sequenced. 
      RESULTS: Three variants of FOXE1-polyalanine length, containing 12, 14, or 16 
      alanine residues, and 5 different genotypes were identified. There were 
      significantly lower frequencies of the 14/14 genotypes in cases with POF (X2 = 
      119.73, P = 0.001), as compared with the controls. The incidence of 16/16 
      genotypes of FOXE1-polyalanine was significantly higher in patients with POF (X2 
      = 3.403, P = 0.001) in comparison to the controls. The FOXE1 14 alanine allele 
      was significantly less common in the POF patient group (186/220) than the 
      controls (216/220) (X2 = 25.923, P = 0.0001). The FOXE1 16 alanine allele was 
      significantly more common in the POF patient group (28/220) than the controls 
      (4/220) (X2 = 19.412, P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: This finding provides evidence 
      that polyalanine repeat expansions in FOXE1 may be responsible for the genetic 
      aetiology of POF in Chinese women.

PG  - 296-300
LID - 10.1002/mds.24021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carriers of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) repeat expansions 
      in the premutation range (55-200 CGG repeats) often develop a syndrome of kinetic 
      tremor, cerebellar ataxia, and parkinsonism; designated the fragile X-associated 
      tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Neurological signs have not been reported in 
      carriers of gray zone (45-54 CGG repeats) expansions. METHODS/RESULTS: We 
      describe 3 patients with FMR1 gray zone alleles who meet diagnostic criteria for 
      FXTAS. CONCLUSIONS: Our cases suggest that the definition of the FXTAS may need 
      to be broadened to include individuals with FMR1 repeat expansions in the gray 
      zone. These neurological signs may be due to elevated levels of expanded CGG 
      repeat FMR1 mRNA in the gray zone carriers, similar to the changes seen in 
      premutation carriers with FXTAS.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual 
      disability. In addition to cognitive deficits, FXS patients exhibit 
      hyperactivity, attention deficits, social difficulties, anxiety, and other 
      autistic-like behaviors. FXS is caused by an expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat in 
      the 5' untranslated region of the Fragile X Mental Retardation (FMR1) gene 
      leading to epigenetic silencing and loss of expression of the Fragile X Mental 
      Retardation protein (FMRP). Despite the known relationship between FMR1 CGG 
      repeat expansion and FMR1 silencing, the epigenetic modifications observed at the 
      FMR1 locus, and the consequences of the loss of FMRP on human neurodevelopment 
      and neuronal function remain poorly understood. To address these limitations, we 
      report on the generation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from 
      multiple patients with FXS and the characterization of their differentiation into 
      post-mitotic neurons and glia. We show that clones from reprogrammed FXS patient 
      fibroblast lines exhibit variation with respect to the predominant CGG-repeat 
      length in the FMR1 gene. In two cases, iPSC clones contained predominant 
      CGG-repeat lengths shorter than measured in corresponding input population of 
      fibroblasts. In another instance, reprogramming a mosaic patient having both 
      normal and pre-mutation length CGG repeats resulted in genetically matched iPSC 
      clonal lines differing in FMR1 promoter CpG methylation and FMRP expression. 
      Using this panel of patient-specific, FXS iPSC models, we demonstrate aberrant 
      neuronal differentiation from FXS iPSCs that is directly correlated with 
      epigenetic modification of the FMR1 gene and a loss of FMRP expression. Overall, 
      these findings provide evidence for a key role for FMRP early in human 
      neurodevelopment prior to synaptogenesis and have implications for modeling of 
      FXS using iPSC technology. By revealing disease-associated cellular phenotypes in 
      human neurons, these iPSC models will aid in the discovery of novel therapeutics 
      for FXS and other autism-spectrum disorders sharing common pathophysiology.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS; MIM #300624), a well-recognized form of inherited human 
      mental retardation is caused, in most cases, by a CGG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in the 5'-untranslated region of FMR1, resulting in reduced expression 
      of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Clinical features include 
      macroorchidism, anxiety, mental retardation, motor coordination, and speech 
      articulation deficits. The Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1-KO) mouse, a mouse model for FXS, 
      has been shown to replicate the macroorchidism, cognitive deficits, and 
      neuroanatomical abnormalities found in human FXS. Here we asked whether Fmr1-KO 
      mice also display appendicular and oromotor deficits comparable to the ataxia and 
      dysarthric speech seen in FXS patients. We employed standard motor tests for 
      balance and appendicular motor coordination, and used a novel long-term 
      fluid-licking assay to investigate oromotor function in Fmr1-KO mice and their 
      wild-type (WT) littermates. Fmr1-KO mice performed equally well as their WT 
      littermates on standard motor tests, with the exception of a raised-beam task. 
      However, Fmr1-KO mice had a significantly slower licking rhythm than their WT 
      littermates. Deficits in rhythmic fluid-licking in Fmr1-KO mice have been linked 
      to cerebellar pathologies. It is believed that balance and motor coordination 
      deficits in FXS patients are caused by cerebellar neurophathologies. The neuronal 
      bases of speech articulation deficits in FXS patients are currently unknown. It 
      is yet to be established whether similar neuronal circuits control rhythmic 
      fluid-licking pattern in mice and speech articulation movement in humans.

      interactions.

LID - 10.1083/jcb.201010027 [doi]
AB  - In neurons, regulation of gene expression occurs in part through translational 
      control at the synapse. A fundamental requirement for such local control is the 
      targeted delivery of select neuronal mRNAs and regulatory RNAs to distal 
      dendritic sites. The nature of spatial RNA destination codes, and the mechanism 
      by which they are interpreted for dendritic delivery, remain poorly understood. 
      We find here that in a key dendritic RNA transport pathway (exemplified by BC1 
      RNA, a dendritic regulatory RNA, and protein kinase M zeta [PKMzeta] mRNA, a dendritic 
      mRNA), noncanonical purine*purine nucleotide interactions are functional 
      determinants of RNA targeting motifs. These motifs are specifically recognized by 
      heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 (hnRNP A2), a trans-acting factor 
      required for dendritic delivery. Binding to hnRNP A2 and ensuing dendritic 
      delivery are effectively competed by RNAs with CGG triplet repeat expansions. CGG 
      repeats, when expanded in the 5' untranslated region of fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) mRNA, cause fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. The 
      data suggest that cellular dysregulation observed in the presence of CGG repeat 
      RNA may result from molecular competition in neuronal RNA transport pathways.

PG  - 618-22
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182299e59 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study determined whether CGG repeat length moderates the 
      relationship between age and performance on selective measures of executive 
      function in premutation carriers (PM) who are asymptomatic for a recently 
      described late-onset neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). METHODS: Forty PM men aged 18-69 years with a 
      family history of fragile X syndrome underwent neuropsychological tests of 
      inhibition and working memory. We examined only men who are asymptomatic for 
      FXTAS. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the moderating role 
      of CGG repeat length on the relation between age and performance on inhibition 
      and working memory tasks. RESULTS: With increasing age and only in men with an 
      FMR1 expansion in the upper premutation range (>100 CGG repeats) was there an 
      association between age and poorer task performance on selective executive 
      function measures involving inhibition (p < 0.05) and executive working memory (p 
      < 0.01). Men in the lower premutation range (<100 CGG repeats) were relatively 
      risk-free from any cognitive aging effects associated with CGG repeat expansions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that neural networks in the prefrontal cortex may be 
      highly susceptible to age-related neurotoxic effects in the upper size range of 
      the FMR1 premutation. Future longitudinal studies will be needed to determine 
      whether specific executive markers may serve to distinguish those at greatest 
      risk for severe cognitive decline or dementia associated with FXTAS.

PG  - 175-84
LID - 10.1007/s11689-011-9085-4 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual 
      disability and is caused by a CGG repeat expansion at Xq27.3 on the FMR1 gene. 
      The majority of young boys with FXS display poor attention and hyperactivity that 
      is disproportionate to their cognitive disability, and approximately 70% meet 
      diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. 
      Psychopharmacology is employed with 82% of young males 5-17 years of age, with 
      stimulant medication as the most common medication prescribed. This study 
      evaluated the effects of stimulant medication on the academic performance, 
      attention, motor activity, and psychophysiological arousal of boys with FXS, as 
      well as the concordance of effects within individuals. Participants in this study 
      included 12 boys with FXS who were treated with stimulants. Participants 
      completed videotaped academic testing on two consecutive days and were randomly 
      assigned to be off stimulants for 1 day and on stimulants the other day. On each 
      day, multiple measures including academic performance, behavior regulation, and 
      psychophysiological arousal were collected. Approximately 75% of participants 
      performed better on attention and academic measures, and 70% showed improved 
      physiological regulation while on stimulant medication. A high degree of 
      concordance among measures was found. Lower intelligence quotient (IQ), but not 
      age, correlated with greater improvements in in-seat behavior. IQ and age did not 
      relate to on-task behaviors. The frequency and magnitude of response to stimulant 
      medication in boys with FXS is higher than those reported for most children with 
      non-specific intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder.

      enhanced. We previously proposed a mechanism whereby the audiogenic seizures 
      exhibited by FMR1 null mice result from an imbalance in excitatory mGluR and 
      inhibitory GABA(B) receptor (GABA(B)R) signaling (Mol Pharmacol 76:18-24, 2009). 
      Here, we tested the mGluR5-positive allosteric modulator 
      3-cyano-N-(1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)benzamide (CDPPB), the mGluR5 inverse 
      agonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP), and GABA(B) receptor agonists, 
      alone and in combination on receptor protein expression and audiogenic seizures 
      in FMR1 mice. Single doses of MPEP (30 mg/kg), the GABA(B)R orthosteric agonist 
      R-baclofen (1 mg/kg), or the GABA(B)R-positive allosteric modulator 
      N,N'-dicyclopentyl-2-(methylthio)-5-nitro-4,6-pyrimidine diamine (GS-39783) (30 
      mg/kg), reduced the incidence of seizures. However, when administered 
      subchronically (daily injections for 6 days), MPEP retained its anticonvulsant 
      activity, whereas R-baclofen and GS-39783 did not. When administered at lower 
      doses that had no effect when given alone, a single injection of MPEP plus 
      R-baclofen also reduced seizures, but the effect was lost after subchronic 
      administration. We were surprised to find that subchronic treatment with 
      R-baclofen also induced tolerance to a single high dose of MPEP. These data 
      demonstrate that tolerance develops rapidly to the antiseizure properties of 
      R-baclofen alone and R-baclofen coadministered with MPEP, but not with MPEP 
      alone. Our findings suggest that cross-talk between the G-protein signaling 
      pathways of these receptors affects drug efficacy after repeated treatment.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by an expanded CGG repeat (>200 repeats) in 
      the 5' un-translated portion of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) 
      leading to a deficiency or absence of the FMR1 protein (FMRP). FMRP is an 
      RNA-binding protein that regulates the translation of a number of other genes 
      that are important for synaptic development and plasticity. Furthermore, many of 
      these genes, when mutated, have been linked to autism in the general population, 
      which may explain the high comorbidity that exists between FXS and autism 
      spectrum disorders (ASD). Additionally, premutation repeat expansions (55 to 200 
      CGG repeats) may also give rise to ASD through a different molecular mechanism 
      that involves a direct toxic effect of FMR1 mRNA. It is believed that RNA 
      toxicity underlies much of the premutation-related involvement, including 
      developmental concerns like autism, as well as neurodegenerative issues with 
      aging such as the fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). RNA 
      toxicity can also lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is common in older 
      premutation carriers both with and without FXTAS. Many of the problems with 
      cellular dysregulation in both premutation and full mutation neurons also 
      parallel the cellular abnormalities that have been documented in idiopathic 
      autism. Research regarding dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems caused by 
      the lack of FMRP in FXS, including metabotropic glutamate receptor 1/5 (mGluR1/5) 
      pathway and GABA pathways, has led to new targeted treatments for FXS. 
      Preliminary evidence suggests that these new targeted treatments will also be 
      beneficial in non-fragile X forms of autism.

TI  - Rare intranuclear inclusions in the brains of 3 older adult males with fragile x 
      syndrome: implications for the spectrum of fragile x-associated disorders.
PG  - 462-9
LID - 10.1097/NEN.0b013e31821d3194 [doi]
AB  - The FMR1 gene is polymorphic for the length of CGG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions in the 5' untranslated region. Premutation (55-200 CGG repeats) and 
      full-mutation (>200 CGG repeats) alleles give rise to their respective disorders 
      by different pathogenic mechanisms: RNA gain-of-function toxicity leads to 
      fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome in the premutation range, and 
      transcriptional silencing and absence of fragile X mental retardation protein 
      (FMRP) lead to fragile X syndrome in the full-mutation range. However, for the 
      latter, incomplete silencing and/or size-mosaicism might result in some 
      contribution to the disease process from residual messenger RNA production. To 
      address this possibility, we examined the brains of 3 cases of fragile X syndrome 
      for the presence of intranuclear inclusions in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. We 
      identified low levels (0.1%-1.3%) of intranuclear inclusions in all 3 cases. 
      Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for FMR1 messenger 
      RNA and immunofluorescence for FMRP revealed low but detectable levels of both 
      RNA and protein in the 3 cases, consistent with the presence of small numbers of 
      inclusions. The intranuclear inclusions were only present in FMRP-immunoreactive 
      cells. The small numbers of inclusions and very low levels of both FMR1 RNA and 
      protein suggest that the clinical course in these 3 subjects would not have been 
      influenced by contributions from RNA toxicity.

PG  - 1900-6
LID - 10.1002/mds.23755 [doi]
AB  - Carriers of fragile X mental retardation 1 repeat expansions in the premutation 
      range (55-200 CGG repeats), especially males, often develop tremor, ataxia, and 
      parkinsonism. These neurological signs are believed to be a result of elevated 
      levels of expanded CGG-repeat fragile X mental retardation 1 mRNA. The purpose of 
      this study was to determine the prevalence of fragile X mental retardation 1 
      repeat expansions in a movement disorder population comprising subjects with all 
      types of tremor, ataxia, and parkinsonism. We screened 335 consecutive patients 
      with tremor, ataxia, or parkinsonism and 273 controls confirmed to have no 
      movement disorders. There was no difference in fragile X mental retardation 1 
      premutation size expansions in the cases compared with controls. Eleven percent 
      of the women with Parkinson's disease had fragile X mental retardation 1 
      gray-zone expansions compared with 4.4% of female controls (odds ratio of 3.2; 
      95% confidence interval, 1.2-8.7). Gray-zone expansions in patients with other 
      phenotypes were not overrepresented in comparison with controls. Fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 premutation range expansions are not more common in a mixed 
      movement disorder population compared with controls. Our results, however, 
      suggest that fragile X mental retardation 1 gray-zone alleles may be associated 
      with Parkinson's disease in women.

AB  - The expansion of CGG repeats in the 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR) of FMR1 gene 
      is the molecular basis of fragile X syndrome in most of the patients. The nature 
      of the flanking sequences in addition to the length and interruption pattern of 
      repeats is predicted to influence CGG repeat instability in the FMR1 gene. We 
      investigated nucleosome occupancy as a contributor to CGG repeat instability in a 
      transgenic mouse model containing unstable (CGG)(26,) from human FMR1 cloned 
      downstream of nucleosome-excluding sequence. We observe that the transgene has an 
      open chromatin structure compared to the stable endogenous mouse Fmr1 within the 
      same nucleus. CGG repeats in mouse Fmr1 are flanked by nucleosomes unlike the 
      repeats in the transgene in all the tissues examined. Further in vitro chromatin 
      reconstitution experiments show that DNA fragment without the SV40ori/EPR 
      (nucleosome-excluding sequence) forms more stable chromatin than the one 
      containing it, despite having the same number of CGG repeats. The correlation 
      between nucleosomal organisation of the FMR1 gene and CGG repeat instability was 
      supported by significantly lower frequency of repeat expansion in mice containing 
      an identical transgene without the SV40ori/EPR. Our studies demonstrate that 
      flanking DNA sequences can influence repeat instability through modulation of 
      nucleosome occupancy in the region.

TI  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia phenotype in a male carrier of unmethylated

AB  - The Fragile X syndrome is caused by a CGG repeat expansion >200 in the promoter 
      of the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene termed full mutation (FM). 
      These alleles are silenced through methylation of the FMR1 promoter, leading to 
      deficit of the FMR1 protein (FMRP), and neurodevelopmental changes. However, 
      occasional FM individuals have a complete lack of methylation, and those 
      typically have only minor deficit of FMRP levels compared with normal controls 
      and their intelligence may be in the normal range. FM alleles are generated 
      through expansion of the CGG repeat from the premutation (PM) range of 55-200 
      repeats, linked to the late onset Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS). This disorder has been attributed to a 'toxicity' of the FMR1 mRNA, 
      which is significantly elevated in male carriers of PM alleles and of 
      unmethylated FM alleles. This is the first report of a 65-year-old male with an 
      unmethylated FM allele and history of alcohol abuse, who developed symptoms of 
      FXTAS. We postulate that, although the elevation of FMR1 transcripts associated 
      with unmethylated FM alleles have a potential to cause FXTAS, in some cases this 
      disorder may occur through an additional effect of exposure to neurotoxicants 
      including alcohol.

TI  - A new method for FMR1 gene methylation screening by multiplex 
      methylation-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction.
PG  - 387-93
LID - 10.1089/gtmb.2010.0191 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited mental retardation 
      in men. It is caused by abnormalities in the FMR1 gene that are associated with 
      CGG repeat expansion and the hypermethylation status of its promoter. Methylated 
      alleles lead to transcriptional inhibition and consequent loss of Fragile X 
      Mental Retardation Protein. Chemical modification of cytosine to uracil by 
      bisulfite treatment has proved to be an attractive method for DNA methylation 
      studies that precludes labor-intensive Southern blot analysis, which is the gold 
      standard test for FXS. In this report, bisulfite-treated DNA samples were 
      amplified using real-time multiplex methylation-specific polymerase chain 
      reaction followed by melting curve analysis. Our results show that all control 
      samples with known CGG repeat numbers and methylation statuses were correctly 
      diagnosed. The samples from 43 male patients were also successfully diagnosed, 
      which were in complete agreement with the results of Southern blotting. By such 
      means, 39 patients were found to have an unmethylated allele; 3, a fully mutated 
      allele; and 1, both methylated and unmethylated alleles, thus implying a 
      diagnosis of mosaicism. In conclusion, we find our method to be convenient for 
      screening a large number of male patients with FXS, because it is rapid and easy 
      to perform, especially when there is a low quantity of DNA that must be 
      sensitively and accurately assayed.

TI  - A nonsense mutation in FMR1 causing fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 489-91
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2010.223 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is a common cause of inherited intellectual disability. It is 
      caused by lack of the FMR1 gene product FMRP. The most frequent cause is the 
      expansion of a CGG repeat located in the 5'UTR of FMR1. Alleles with 200 or more 
      repeats become hypermethylated and transcriptionally silent. Only few patients 
      with intragenic point mutations in FMR1 have been reported and, currently, 
      routine analysis of patients referred for fragile X syndrome includes solely 
      analysis for repeat expansion and methylation status. We identified a 
      substitution in exon 2 of FMR1, c.80C>A, causing a nonsense mutation p.Ser27X, in 
      a patient with classical clinical symptoms of fragile X syndrome. The mother who 
      carried the mutation in heterozygous form presented with mild intellectual 
      impairment. We conclude that further studies including western blot and DNA 
      sequence analysis of the FMR1 gene should be performed in patients with typical 
      symptoms of fragile X syndrome in whom no CGG repeat expansion is detected.

TI  - Distribution of CGG/GCC repeats at the FMR1 and FMR2 genes in an Indian 
      population with mental retardation of unknown etiology.
PG  - 281-4
LID - 10.1089/gtmb.2010.0167 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Fragile X syndrome is one of the X-linked disorders associated with 
      moderate to severe mental retardation. Fragile X A syndrome (FRAXA) and fragile X 
      E syndrome (FRAXE) are caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion of CGG and GCC 
      repeats at the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 and FMR2 genes, respectively. 
      The present study was undertaken to identify the repeat polymorphism and to 
      estimate the risk of transmission in Andhra Pradesh and surrounding states of 
      South India. RESULTS: The FRAXA and FRAXE allelic polymorphisms were studied by 
      radioactive polymerase chain reaction that revealed 25 FRAXA among 344 
      X-chromosomes and 20 FRAXE allelic variants among 212 X-chromosomes in our 
      population. The most frequent FRAXA allele size was of 29 CGG repeats (27.5%) 
      followed by allele sizes of 28 (20.8%) and 31 (7.2%), and that of FRAXE was 15 
      GCC repeats (24.0%) followed by allele containing 18 repeats (18.4%) and 16 
      repeats (11.3%). CONCLUSIONS: CGG/GCC repeat polymorphism at the FMR1 and FMR2 
      loci observed in this study demonstrated a racial and ethnic variation among the 
      populations.

LID - e1001240
AB  - Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) is a common inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat in the 5'UTR of the 
      fragile X syndrome (FXS) gene, FMR1. The expanded CGG repeat is thought to induce 
      toxicity as RNA, and in FXTAS patients mRNA levels for FMR1 are markedly 
      increased. Despite the critical role of FMR1 mRNA in disease pathogenesis, the 
      basis for the increase in FMR1 mRNA expression is unknown. Here we show that 
      overexpressing any of three histone deacetylases (HDACs 3, 6, or 11) suppresses 
      CGG repeat-induced neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of FXTAS. This 
      suppression results from selective transcriptional repression of the CGG 
      repeat-containing transgene. These findings led us to evaluate the acetylation 
      state of histones at the human FMR1 locus. In patient-derived lymphoblasts and 
      fibroblasts, we determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation that there is 
      increased acetylation of histones at the FMR1 locus in pre-mutation carriers 
      compared to control or FXS derived cell lines. These epigenetic changes correlate 
      with elevated FMR1 mRNA expression in pre-mutation cell lines. Consistent with 
      this finding, histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors repress FMR1 mRNA 
      expression to control levels in pre-mutation carrier cell lines and extend 
      lifespan in CGG repeat-expressing Drosophila. These findings support a disease 
      model whereby the CGG repeat expansion in FXTAS promotes chromatin remodeling in 
      cis, which in turn increases expression of the toxic FMR1 mRNA. Moreover, these 
      results provide proof of principle that HAT inhibitors or HDAC activators might 
      be used to selectively repress transcription at the FMR1 locus.

TI  - Determinants of R-loop formation at convergent bidirectionally transcribed 
      trinucleotide repeats.
PG  - 1749-62
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkq935 [doi]
AB  - R-loops have been described at immunoglobulin class switch sequences, prokaryotic 
      and mitochondrial replication origins, and disease-associated (CAG)n and (GAA)n 
      trinucleotide repeats. The determinants of trinucleotide R-loop formation are 
      unclear. Trinucleotide repeat expansions cause diseases including DM1 (CTG)n, 
      SCA1 (CAG)n, FRAXA (CGG)n, FRAXE (CCG)n and FRDA (GAA)n. Bidirectional convergent 
      transcription across these disease repeats can occur. We find R-loops formed when 
      CTG or CGG and their complementary strands CAG or CCG were transcribed; GAA 
      transcription, but not TTC, yielded R-loops. R-loop formation was sensitive to 
      DNA supercoiling, repeat length, insensitive to repeat interruptions, and formed 
      by extension of RNA:DNA hybrids in the RNA polymerase. R-loops arose by 
      transcription in one direction followed by transcription in the opposite 
      direction, and during simultaneous convergent bidirectional transcription of the 
      same repeat forming double R-loop structures. Since each transcribed disease 
      repeat formed R-loops suggests they may have biological functions.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a premutation CGG-trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion (55-200 CGG repeats) within the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 
      gene. Although FXTAS generally affects premutation carriers over 50 years of age, 
      cognitive and psychological symptoms can appear in carriers during childhood, 
      suggesting that the FMR1 premutation affects brain function early in life. Recent 
      work with cultured hippocampal neurons from a premutation (Fmr1 CGG knock-in) 
      mouse model revealed impaired development of early postnatal neurons, consistent 
      with the developmental clinical involvement of premutation carriers. In the 
      current work, we show that the presence of premutation CGG-repeat expansions in 
      the mouse Fmr1 gene alters embryonic neocortical development. Specifically, 
      embryonic premutation mice display migration defects in the neocortex and altered 
      expression of neuronal lineage markers. The current data demonstrate that 
      premutation alleles of the Fmr1 gene are associated with defects in developmental 
      programs operating during prenatal stages of brain formation and provide further 
      evidence that the FMR1 premutation has a neurodevelopmental component.

TI  - Fragile X and autism: Intertwined at the molecular level leading to targeted 
      treatments.
PG  - 12
LID - 10.1186/2040-2392-1-12 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by an expanded CGG repeat (> 200 repeats) in 
      the 5' untranslated portion of the fragile mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1), 
      leading to deficiency or absence of the FMR1 protein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA 
      carrier protein that controls the translation of several other genes that 
      regulate synaptic development and plasticity. Autism occurs in approximately 30% 
      of FXS cases, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified 
      (PDD-NOS) occurs in an additional 30% of cases. Premutation repeat expansions (55 
      to 200 CGG repeats) may also give rise to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), 
      including both autism and PDD-NOS, through a different molecular mechanism that 
      involves a direct toxic effect of the expanded CGG repeat FMR1 mRNA. RNA toxicity 
      can also lead to aging effects including tremor, ataxia and cognitive decline, 
      termed fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), in premutation 
      carriers in late life. In studies of mice bearing premutation expansions, there 
      is evidence of early postnatal neuronal cell toxicity, presenting as reduced cell 
      longevity, decreased dendritic arborization and altered synaptic morphology. 
      There is also evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in premutation carriers. Many 
      of the problems with cellular dysregulation in both premutation and full mutation 
      neurons also parallel the cellular abnormalities that have been documented in 
      autism without fragile X mutations. Research regarding dysregulation of 
      neurotransmitter systems in FXS, including the metabotropic glutamate receptor 
      (mGluR)1/5 pathway and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)A pathways, have led to new 
      targeted treatments for FXS. Preliminary evidence suggests that these new 
      targeted treatments will also be beneficial in non-fragile X forms of autism.

      responses.
PG  - 560-5
LID - 10.1016/j.rbmo.2010.05.015 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. 
      It is caused by a CGG repeat expansion, which results in hypermethylation and 
      silencing of the FMR1 gene. The results from 213 FXS prenatal diagnoses performed 
      in the study centre were reviewed. Family history of FXS or undiagnosed mental 
      retardation (MR) were the reasons for referral and 64% of mothers were not aware 
      of their status so prenatal and mother tests were performed at the same time. 
      Among those women referred for family history of unknown MR, 17.6% were found to 
      be FXS carriers. The attitudes and perceptions of the syndrome of 52 FXS carriers 
      were also evaluated. Most of them had been diagnosed as carriers when the child 
      was already born and the most common feeling was sadness, followed by impotence 
      and guilt. The majority of them had received genetic counselling and they 
      considered it useful. Regarding reproductive options, prenatal diagnosis was 
      chosen by 40.5% of women. Prenatal diagnosis for FXS is a good reproductive 
      option and it should be carried out whenever family history of MR is present. A 
      high percentage of FXS carriers are detected following this approach.

      developmentally delayed males.

LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.33626 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited form of developmental delay, 
      is typically caused by CGG-repeat expansion in FMR1. However, little attention 
      has been paid to sequence variants in FMR1. Through the use of pooled-template 
      massively parallel sequencing, we identified 130 novel FMR1 sequence variants in 
      a population of 963 developmentally delayed males without CGG-repeat expansion 
      mutations. Among these, we identified a novel missense change, p.R138Q, which 
      alters a conserved residue in the nuclear localization signal of FMRP. We have 
      also identified three promoter mutations in this population, all of which 
      significantly reduce in vitro levels of FMR1 transcription. Additionally, we 
      identified 10 noncoding variants of possible functional significance in the 
      introns and 3'-untranslated region of FMR1, including two predicted splice site 
      mutations. These findings greatly expand the catalog of known FMR1 sequence 
      variants and suggest that FMR1 sequence variants may represent an important cause 
      of developmental delay.

LID - 10.2353/jmoldx.2010.090227 [doi]
AB  - (CGG)(n) repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene is associated with fragile X syndrome 
      and other disorders. Current methods for FMR1 molecular testing rely on Southern 
      blot analysis to detect expanded alleles too large to be PCR-amplified and to 
      identify female homozygous alleles that often confound interpretations of PCR 
      data. A novel, single-tube CGG repeat primed FMR1 PCR technology was designed 
      with two gene-specific primers that flank the triplet repeat region, as well as a 
      third primer that is complementary to the (CGG)(n) repeat. This PCR was evaluated 
      with 171 unique DNA samples, including a blinded set of 146 clinical specimens. 
      The method detected all alleles reported by Southern blot analysis, including 
      full mutations in 66 clinical samples and comprised up to 1300 CGG. Furthermore, 
      a blinded cohort of 42 female homozygous and heterozygous specimens, including 21 
      with full mutation alleles, was resolved with 100% accuracy. Last, AGG 
      interrupter sequences, which may influence the risk of (CGG)(n) expansion in the 
      children of some carriers, were each correctly identified in 14 male and female 
      clinical samples as referenced to DNA sequencing. As a result, this PCR provides 
      robust detection of expanded alleles and resolves allele zygosity, thus 
      minimizing the number of samples that require Southern blot analysis and 
      producing more comprehensive FMR1 genotyping data than other methods.

AB  - Population screening has been proposed for Fragile X syndrome to identify 
      premutation carrier females and affected newborns. We developed a PCR-based assay 
      capable of quickly detecting the presence or absence of an expanded FMR1 allele 
      with high sensitivity and specificity. This assay combines a triplet repeat 
      primed PCR with high-throughput automated capillary electrophoresis. We evaluated 
      assay performance using archived samples sent for Fragile X diagnostic testing 
      representing a range of Fragile X CGG-repeat expansions. Two hundred five 
      previously genotyped samples were tested with the new assay. Data were analyzed 
      for the presence of a trinucleotide "ladder" extending beyond 55 repeats, which 
      was set as a cut-off to identify expanded FMR1 alleles. We identified expanded 
      FMR1 alleles in 132 samples (59 premutation, 71 full mutation, 2 mosaics) and 
      normal FMR1 alleles in 73 samples. We found 100% concordance with previous 
      results from PCR and Southern blot analyses. In addition, we show feasibility of 
      using this assay with DNA extracted from dried-blood spots. Using a single PCR 
      combined with high-throughput fragment analysis on the automated capillary 
      electrophoresis instrument, we developed a rapid and reproducible PCR-based 
      laboratory assay that meets many of the requirements for a first-tier test for 
      population screening.

TI  - Comparative analysis of DNA methylation in transgenic mice with unstable CGG

LID - 11417 [pii]
AB  - Methylation of CpG sequences in and around CGG triplet repeats in FMR1 gene has 
      strong correlation with manifestation of the fragile X syndrome in human 
      patients. In contrast, we have observed a lack of correlation between repeat 
      instability and DNA methylation in three different transgenic mouse models 
      harboring unstable CGG repeats. Further we have demonstrated that the endogenous 
      copy of mouse Fmr1 gene remains unmethylated both in males and females. These 
      results imply that methylation and repeat instability are independent events and 
      raise the possibility that methylation could also result in repression of FMR1 
      transcription in the absence of repeat expansion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by loss of function mutations in 
      the FMR1 gene. Trinucleotide CGG-repeat expansions, resulting in FMR1 gene 
      silencing, are the most common mutations observed at this locus. Even though the 
      repeat expansion mutation is a functional null mutation, few conventional 
      mutations have been identified at this locus, largely due to the clinical 
      laboratory focus on the repeat tract. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To more 
      thoroughly evaluate the frequency of conventional mutations in FXS-like patients, 
      we used an array-based method to sequence FMR1 in 51 unrelated males exhibiting 
      several features characteristic of FXS but with normal CGG-repeat tracts of FMR1. 
      One patient was identified with a deletion in FMR1, but none of the patients were 
      found to have other conventional mutations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data 
      suggest that missense mutations in FMR1 are not a common cause of the FXS 
      phenotype in patients who have normal-length CGG-repeat tracts. However, 
      screening for small deletions of FMR1 may be of clinically utility.

TI  - Potassium bromate, a potent DNA oxidizing agent, exacerbates germline repeat 
      expansion in a fragile X premutation mouse model.
PG  - 611-6
LID - 10.1002/humu.21237 [doi]
AB  - Tandem repeat expansion is responsible for the Repeat Expansion Diseases, a group 
      of human genetic disorders that includes Fragile X syndrome (FXS). FXS results 
      from expansion of a premutation (PM) allele having 55-200 CGG.CCG-repeats in the 
      5' UTR of the FMR1 gene. The mechanism of expansion is unknown. We have treated 
      FX PM mice with potassium bromate (KBrO(3)), a potent DNA oxidizing agent. We 
      then monitored the germline and somatic expansion frequency in the progeny of 
      these animals. We show here that KBrO(3) increased both the level of 8-oxoG in 
      the oocytes of treated animals and the germline expansion frequency. Our data 
      thus suggest that oxidative damage may be a factor that could affect expansion 
      risk in humans.

TI  - Methylation of novel markers of fragile X alleles is inversely correlated with 
      FMRP expression and FMR1 activation ratio.
PG  - 1618-32
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddq037 [doi]
AB  - The fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by silencing of the fragile X mental 
      retardation gene (FMR1) and the absence of its product, fragile X mental 
      retardation protein (FMRP), resulting from CpG island methylation associated with 
      large CGG repeat expansions (more than 200) termed full mutation (FM). We have 
      identified a number of novel epigenetic markers for FXS using matrix-assisted 
      laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), 
      naming the most informative fragile X-related epigenetic element 1 (FREE1) and 2 
      (FREE2). Methylation of both regions was correlated with that of the FMR1 CpG 
      island detected using Southern blot (FREE1 R = 0.97; P < 0.00001, n = 23 and 
      FREE2 R = 0.93; P < 0.00001, n = 23) and negatively correlated with lymphocyte 
      expression of FMRP (FREE1 R = -0.62; P = 0.01, n = 15 and FREE2 R = -0.55; P = 
      0.03, n = 15) in blood of partially methylated 'high functioning' FM males. In 
      blood of FM carrier females, methylation of both markers was inversely correlated 
      with the FMR1 activation ratio (FREE1 R = -0.93; P < 0.0001, n = 12 and FREE2 R = 
      -0.95; P < 0.0001, n = 9). In a sample set of 49 controls, 18 grey zone (GZ 40-54 
      repeats), 22 premutation (PM 55-170 repeats) and 22 (affected) FXS subjects, the 
      FREE1 methylation pattern was consistent between blood and chorionic villi as a 
      marker of methylated FM alleles and could be used to differentiate FXS males and 
      females from controls, as well as from carriers of GZ/PM alleles, but not between 
      GZ and PM alleles and controls. Considering its high-throughput and specificity 
      for pathogenic FM alleles, low cost and minimal DNA requirements, FREE MALDI-TOF 
      MS offers a unique tool in FXS diagnostics and newborn population screening.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is an adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by CGG trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 
      fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. The neuropathological hallmark of the 
      disease is the presence of ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions in neurons 
      and in astrocytes. Ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions have also been 
      found in the neurons of transgenic mice model carrying an expanded CGG((98)) 
      trinucleotide repeat of human origin but have not previously been described in 
      glial cells. Therefore, we used immunocytochemical methods to determine the 
      pathological features of nuclear and/or cytoplasmic inclusions in astrocytes, 
      Bergmann glia, and neurons, as well as relationships between inclusion patterns, 
      age, and repeat length in CGG knock-in (KI) mice in comparison with wild-type 
      mice. In CGG KI mice, ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions were found in 
      neurons (e.g., pyramidal cells, GABAergic neurons) throughout the brain in 
      cortical and subcortical brain regions; these inclusions increased in number and 
      size with advanced age. Ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions were also 
      present in protoplasmic astrocytes, including Bergmann glia in the cerebellum. 
      The morphology of intranuclear inclusions in CGG KI mice was compared to that of 
      typical inclusions in human neurons and astrocytes in postmortem FXTAS brain 
      tissue. This new finding of previously unreported pathology in astrocytes of CGG 
      KI mice now provides an important mouse model to study astrocyte pathology in 
      human FXTAS.

AB  - The mental retardation, autistic features, and behavioral abnormalities 
      characteristic of the Fragile X mental retardation syndrome result from the loss 
      of function of the RNA-binding protein FMRP. The disease is usually caused by a 
      triplet repeat expansion in the 5'UTR of the FMR1 gene. This leads to loss of 
      function through transcriptional gene silencing, pointing to a key function for 
      FMRP, but precluding genetic identification of critical activities within the 
      protein. Moreover, antisense transcripts (FMR4, ASFMR1) in the same locus have 
      been reported to be silenced by the repeat expansion. Missense mutations offer 
      one means of confirming a central role for FMRP in the disease, but to date, only 
      a single such patient has been described. This patient harbors an isoleucine to 
      asparagine mutation (I304N) in the second FMRP KH-type RNA-binding domain, 
      however, this single case report was complicated because the patient harbored a 
      superimposed familial liver disease. To address these issues, we have generated a 
      new Fragile X Syndrome mouse model in which the endogenous Fmr1 gene harbors the 
      I304N mutation. These mice phenocopy the symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome in the 
      existing Fmr1-null mouse, as assessed by testicular size, behavioral phenotyping, 
      and electrophysiological assays of synaptic plasticity. I304N FMRP retains some 
      functions, but has specifically lost RNA binding and polyribosome association; 
      moreover, levels of the mutant protein are markedly reduced in the brain 
      specifically at a time when synapses are forming postnatally. These data suggest 
      that loss of FMRP function, particularly in KH2-mediated RNA binding and in 
      synaptic plasticity, play critical roles in pathogenesis of the Fragile X 
      Syndrome and establish a new model for studying the disorder.

AB  - Fragile X associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative 
      disorder that is the result of a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the range 
      of 55-200 in the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene. To better understand the progression of 
      this disorder, a knock-in (CGG KI) mouse was developed by substituting the mouse 
      CGG8 trinucleotide repeat with an expanded CGG98 repeat from human origin. It has 
      been shown that this mouse shows deficits on the water maze at 52 weeks of age. 
      In the present study, this CGG KI mouse model of FXTAS was tested on behavioral 
      tasks that emphasize spatial information processing. The results demonstrate that 
      at 12 and 24 weeks of age, CGG KI mice were unable to detect a change in the 
      distance between two objects (metric task), but showed intact detection of a 
      transposition of the objects (topological task). At 48 weeks of age, CGG KI mice 
      were unable to detect either change in object location. These data indicate that 
      hippocampal-dependent impairments in spatial processing may occur prior to 
      parietal cortex-dependent impairments in FXTAS.

TI  - Examination of FMR1 transcript and protein levels among 74 premutation carriers.
PG  - 66-8
LID - 10.1038/jhg.2009.121 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X-associated disorders are caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      in the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. Expansion of the CGG 
      trinucleotide repeats to >200 copies (that is, a full mutation) induces 
      methylation of the FMR1 gene, with transcriptional silencing being the eventual 
      outcome. Previous data have shown that FMR1 premutation carriers (individuals 
      with 55-199 repeats) have increased FMR1 mRNA levels with decreased protein 
      (fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)) levels. However, the point at which 
      this translational inefficiency occurs, given the increased transcription 
      mechanism, has not yet been explored and remains to be elucidated. We examined 
      the repeat length group, FMR1 transcript and FMRP levels in 74 males with a wide 
      range of repeat lengths using analysis of covariance to better characterize this 
      association. Results showed that the mean FMRP level among carriers with 80-89 
      repeats was significantly higher than the mean levels among lower (54-79) and 
      higher (90-120) premutation carriers, in spite of the increasing transcript level 
      with repeat length. Taken together, these results suggest that the 80-89-repeat 
      group may lead to different properties that increase the efficiency of 
      translation compared with other premutation repeat size groups.

AB  - Premutation CGG repeat expansions (55-200 CGG repeats; preCGG) within the fragile 
      X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene give rise to the neurodegenerative disorder, 
      fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), primary ovarian 
      insufficiency and neurodevelopmental problems. Morphometric analysis of Map2B 
      immunofluorescence reveals that neurons cultured from heterozygous female mice 
      with preCGG repeats in defined medium display shorter dendritic lengths and fewer 
      branches between 7 and 21 days in vitro compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. 
      Although the numbers of synapsin and phalloidin puncta do not differ from WT, 
      preCGG neurons possess larger puncta. PreCGG neurons display lower viability, and 
      express elevated stress protein as they mature. PreCGG neurons have inherently 
      different patterns of growth, dendritic complexity and synaptic architecture 
      discernable early in the neuronal trajectory to maturation, and may reflect a 
      cellular basis for the developmental component of the spectrum of clinical 
      involvement in carriers of premutation alleles. The reduced viability of preCGG 
      neurons is consistent with the mRNA toxicity and neurodegeneration associated 
      with FXTAS.

TI  - Incidence of fragile X syndrome by newborn screening for methylated FMR1 DNA.
PG  - 503-14
LID - 10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.09.007 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from a CGG-repeat expansion that triggers 
      hypermethylation and silencing of the FMR1 gene. FXS is referred to as the most 
      common form of inherited intellectual disability, yet its true incidence has 
      never been measured directly by large population screening. Here, we developed an 
      inexpensive and high-throughput assay to quantitatively assess FMR1 methylation 
      in DNA isolated from the dried blood spots of 36,124 deidentified newborn males. 
      This assay displays 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity for detecting FMR1 
      methylation, successfully distinguishing normal males from males with 
      full-mutation FXS. Furthermore, the assay can detect excess FMR1 methylation in 
      82% of females with full mutations, although the methylation did not correlate 
      with intellectual disability. With amelogenin PCR used for detecting the presence 
      of a Y chromosome, this assay can also detect males with Klinefelter syndrome 
      (KS) (47, XXY). We identified 64 males with FMR1 methylation and, after 
      confirmatory testing, found seven to have full-mutation FXS and 57 to have KS. 
      Because the precise incidence of KS is known, we used our observed KS incidence 
      as a sentinel to assess ascertainment quality and showed that our KS incidence of 
      1 in 633 newborn males was not significantly different from the literature 
      incidence of 1 in 576 (p = 0.79). The seven FXS males revealed an FXS incidence 
      in males of 1 in 5161 (95% confidence interval of 1 in 10,653-1 in 2500), 
      consistent with some earlier indirect estimates. Given the trials now underway 
      for possible FXS treatments, this method could be used in newborn or infant 
      screening as a way of ensuring early interventions for FXS.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) affects older males carrying 
      premutation, that is, expansions of the CGG repeat (in the 55-200 range), in the 
      FMR1 gene. The neurological changes are linked to the excessive FMR1 messenger 
      RNA (mRNA), becoming toxic through a 'gain-of-function'. Because elevated levels 
      of this mRNA are also found in carriers of the smaller expansion (grey zone) 
      alleles, ranging from 40 to 54 CGGs, we tested for a possible role of these 
      alleles in the origin of movement disorders associated with tremor. We screened 
      228 Australian males affected with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and other 
      causes of parkinsonism recruited from Victoria and Tasmania for premutation and 
      grey zone alleles. The frequencies of either of these alleles were compared with 
      the frequencies in a population-based sample of 578 Guthrie spots from 
      consecutive Tasmanian male newborns (controls). There was a significant excess of 
      premutation carriers (Fisher's exact test p = 0.006). There was also a more than 
      twofold increase in grey zone carriers in the combined sample of the Victorian 
      and Tasmanian cases, with odds ratio (OR ) = 2.36, and 95% confidence intervals 
      (CI): 1.20-4.63, as well as in Tasmanian cases only (OR = 2.33, 95% CI: 
      1.06-5.13), compared with controls. The results suggest that the FMR1 grey zone 
      alleles, as well as premutation alleles, might contribute to the aetiology of 
      disorders associated with parkinsonism.

TI  - ATM and ATR protect the genome against two different types of tandem repeat 
      instability in Fragile X premutation mice.
PG  - 6371-7
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkp666 [doi]
AB  - Expansion of a tandem repeat tract is responsible for the Repeat Expansion 
      diseases, a group of more than 20 human genetic disorders that includes those 
      like Fragile X (FX) syndrome that result from repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene. 
      We have previously shown that the ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) checkpoint kinase 
      protects the genome against one type of repeat expansion in a FX premutation 
      mouse model. By crossing the FX premutation mice to Ataxia Telangiectasia-Mutated 
      (Atm) mutant mice, we show here that ATM also prevents repeat expansion. However, 
      our data suggest that the ATM-sensitive mechanism is different from the 
      ATR-sensitive one. Specifically, the effect of the ATM deficiency is more marked 
      when the premutation allele is paternally transmitted and expansions occur more 
      frequently in male offspring regardless of the Atm genotype of the offspring. The 
      gender effect is most consistent with a repair event occurring in the early 
      embryo that is more efficient in females, perhaps as a result of the action of an 
      X-linked DNA repair gene. Our data thus support the hypothesis that two different 
      mechanisms of FX repeat expansion exist, an ATR-sensitive mechanism seen on 
      maternal transmission and an ATM-sensitive mechanism that shows a male expansion 
      bias.

TI  - Polymerase chain reaction, nuclease digestion, and mass spectrometry based assay 
      for the trinucleotide repeat status of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene.
PG  - 5533-40
LID - 10.1021/ac9008918 [doi]
AB  - CGG repeat expansions in the 5' noncoding region of the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 gene (FMR1) give rise to both neurodevelopmental and 
      neurodegenerative human diseases depending on the length of the expansion. 
      Expansions beyond 200 repeats (full mutation) generally result in gene silencing 
      and fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading heritable form of cognitive impairment 
      and autism. Smaller expansions (55-200 CGG repeats; "premutation") give rise to 
      the neurodegenerative disorder fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS) through an entirely distinct, toxic mRNA gain-of-function mechanism. A 
      rapid means for both high-risk and newborn screening for allele size would 
      provide a greater opportunity for early intervention and family counseling as 
      well as furnish critical data on repeat size distribution and expanded allele 
      frequencies. In the current work, we propose a novel mass spectrometry (MS) based 
      method for the rapid identification of expanded CGG repeats to complement a 
      recently described polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for large population 
      screening. In this combined approach, the optimized PCR method is used to amplify 
      the relevant region of FMR1, followed by extensive nonspecific nuclease 
      digestion. The resulting oligonucleotides are analyzed by MS in a manner that 
      provides the relative proportion of triplet repeat oligonucleotides in seconds 
      per sample. This assay enables swift and reproducible detection of expanded CGG 
      alleles using a single blood spot and in principle is suitable for large scale 
      studies and newborn screening. Moreover, this analytical scheme establishes a 
      unique new intersection of MS with molecular biology, with potential for 
      significant interdisciplinary impact.

AB  - Non-coding (CGG-repeat) expansions in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) 
      gene result in a spectrum of disorders involving altered neurodevelopment 
      (fragile X syndrome), neurodegeneration (late-onset fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome), or primary ovarian insufficiency. While reliable and 
      quantitative assays for the number of CGG repeats and FMR1 mRNA levels are now 
      available, there has been no scalable, quantitative assay for the FMR1 protein 
      (FMRP) in non-transformed cells. Using a combination of avian and murine 
      antibodies to FMRP, we developed a sensitive and highly specific sandwich 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for FMRP in peripheral blood 
      lymphocytes. This ELISA method is capable of quantifying FMRP levels throughout 
      the biologically relevant range of protein concentrations and is specific for the 
      intact FMRP protein. Moreover, the ELISA is well-suited for replicate protein 
      determinations across serial dilutions in non-transformed cells and is readily 
      scalable for large sample numbers. The FMRP ELISA is potentially a powerful tool 
      in expanding our understanding of the relationship between FMRP levels and the 
      various FMR1-associated clinical phenotypes.

TI  - Screening for the presence of FMR1 premutation alleles in women with 
      parkinsonism.
PG  - 244-9
LID - 10.1001/archneurol.2008.548 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a progressive, 
      late-onset neurodegenerative disease that affects older carriers of premutation 
      (CGG) repeat expansions of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. 
      Clinical features include intention tremor, gait ataxia, memory loss, peripheral 
      neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, and parkinsonism. The presence of parkinsonism 
      in FXTAS raises the possibility that some individuals who have Parkinson disease 
      are actually carriers of a premutation FMR1 allele. OBJECTIVE: To screen DNA 
      samples from a large cohort of females with Parkinson disease for an excess of 
      expanded alleles of the FMR1 gene. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: We screened a cohort of 
      595 women with parkinsonism, the largest screening of a parkinsonism-associated 
      group to date, for the presence of an FMR1 premutation allele (55-200 CGG 
      repeats). The screening protocol uses an enhanced polymerase chain reaction 
      method capable of flagging any FMR1 expanded CGG repeat in women as well as in 
      men. SETTING: Diagnostic assessments were performed at an outpatient tertiary 
      clinic (Parkinson Institute, Milan). Genotyping was conducted at the University 
      of California, Davis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CGG repeat number and 
      clinical/neuroimaging assessments of patients with Parkinson disease were 
      conducted. Two premutation carriers were identified. RESULTS: Two individuals 
      possessed an FMR1 allele in the premutation range (CGG repeats: 30 and 75; 30 and 
      115). This carrier frequency (2 of 595 [0.34%]) is not significantly different 
      from estimates of the allele frequency among women in the general population 
      (0.4%-0.8%). Clinical and radiologic features of these 2 patients were similar to 
      those of the general Parkinson disease population; however, 1 patient (115 CGG 
      repeats) had a family history of 2 sons with the fragile X syndrome. CONCLUSION: 
      Screening of women within the parkinsonism clinical spectrum is unlikely to be 
      productive in the absence of additional medical or family history suggestive of 
      involvement of the FMR1 gene.

TI  - Preimplantation genetic diagnosis for fragile X syndrome: is there increased 
      transmission of abnormal FMR1 alleles among female heterozygotes?
PG  - 57-61
LID - 10.1002/pd.2179 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome is caused by a CGG triplet-repeat expansion 
      mutation in the FMR1 gene. Previous studies have shown increased transmission of 
      abnormal alleles in the 51-60 repeat range. This study was undertaken to evaluate 
      the performance of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for fragile X, and to 
      assess the transmission rate of the abnormal FMR1 alleles in this setting. 
      METHOD: The study included 18 fragile X carriers who applied for PGD. FMR1 CGG 
      repeats ranged from 70 to 300. PGD was performed using multiplex-nested PCR, with 
      simultaneous amplification of the CGG repeat region and several polymorphic 
      markers, and sex chromosome markers. RESULTS: Four patients had a poor ovarian 
      response, and could not undergo PGD. The remaining 14 patients underwent 47 PGD 
      cycles. A total of 565 oocytes were aspirated. Of the 386 embryos that were 
      successfully biopsied, 18 (6.4%) could not be analyzed due to amplification 
      failure, and 12 (4.3%) had sex chromosomal abnormalities. Of the remaining 250 
      embryos, the abnormal allele was transmitted to 124 embryos (49.6%) compared to 
      126 (50.4%) for the normal allele. This difference was not statistically 
      significant. Only embryos carrying the normal allele were transferred, resulting 
      in 7 clinical pregnancies (18% per embryo transfer). CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      demonstrate that PGD for fragile X is feasible, and that carriers transmit the 
      abnormal allele at the same frequency as the normal allele.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome is caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion of the FMR1 
      gene. Individuals with fragile X display several behavioral abnormalities 
      including hyperactivity, social anxiety, autistic-like features, impaired 
      cognitive processing, and impaired sensorimotor gating. The Fmr1KO mouse model of 
      fragile X exhibits several related behavioral phenotypes such as increased 
      activity and altered social interactions. Individuals with fragile X also have 
      impaired sensorimotor gating as measured using the prepulse inhibition of startle 
      response. The authors have recently shown that Fmr1KO mice with a yeast 
      artificial chromosome containing the human FMR1 gene have corrected or 
      overcorrected abnormal behaviors including hyperactivity and altered social 
      interactions. Here the authors present results from a study examining abnormal 
      sensorimotor gating in Fmr1KO mice. Consistent with previous findings, Fmr1KO 
      mice have increased prepulse inhibition. The KO mice with the yeast artificial 
      chromosome containing the human FMR1 gene had levels of prepulse inhibition 
      comparable to WT mice, indicating not only a correction of this phenotype, but 
      also clearly demonstrating that in mice levels of the fragile X mental 
      retardation protein regulate sensorimotor gating.

TI  - No evidence for a difference in neuropsychological profile among carriers and 
      noncarriers of the FMR1 premutation in adults under the age of 50.

AB  - The 5' untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation gene, FMR1, 
      contains a polymorphic CGG repeat. Expansions of this repeat are associated with 
      a spectrum of disorders. Full mutation alleles, repeats >or= 200, are associated 
      with fragile X syndrome. Premutation alleles, repeats of approximately 55-199, 
      are associated with a tremor-ataxia syndrome most commonly in older males and 
      primary ovarian insufficiency in females. However, the neuropsychological impact 
      of carrying a premutation allele is presently unclear in younger adults. In this 
      study, we analyzed neuropsychological scores for 138 males and 506 females 
      ascertained from the general population and from families with a history of 
      fragile X syndrome. Subjects were age 18-50 years and had varying repeat lengths. 
      Neuropsychological scores were obtained from measures of general intelligence, 
      memory, and executive functioning, including attention. Principal component 
      analysis followed by varimax rotation was used to create independent factors for 
      analysis. These factors were modeled for males and females separately via a 
      general linear model that accounted for correlation among related subjects. All 
      models were adjusted for potential confounders, including age at testing, 
      ethnicity, and household income. Among males, no repeat length associations were 
      detected for any factor. Among females, only a significant association with 
      repeat length and self-report attention (p < 0.01) was detected, with premutation 
      carriers self-reporting significantly more attention-related problems compared to 
      noncarriers. No significant interactions between repeat length and age were 
      detected. Overall, these results indicate the lack of a global neuropsychological 
      impact of carrying a premutation allele among adults under the age of 50.

AB  - Premutation carriers of repeat expansions in the fragile X mental retardation 
      (FMR1) gene develop kinetic tremor and ataxia or the 'fragile X associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome' (FXTAS). Affected FMR1 premutation carriers also have 
      parkinsonism, but have not been reported to meet criteria for Parkinson disease. 
      This case series illustrates that some patients who are FMR1 premutation carriers 
      may appear by history and examination to have idiopathic Parkinson disease. Based 
      on previous studies, it is likely that the genetic mutation and parkinsonism are 
      associated. Although screening all PD patients is likely to be low yield, genetic 
      testing of FMR1 in individuals with PD and a family history of fragile X 
      syndrome, autism or developmental delay, or other related FMR1 phenotypes is 
      warranted.

TI  - Abnormal nerve conduction features in fragile X premutation carriers.
PG  - 495-8
LID - 10.1001/archneur.65.4.495 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Distal neuropathy is part of the clinical phenotype in most males 
      with the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) caused by the 55 to 
      200 CGG repeat expansion. METHODS: We performed nerve conduction studies in 16 
      male carriers with FXTAS, 11 non-FXTAS carriers, and 11 control subjects and 
      assessed the outcomes with respect to the fragile X mental retardation 1 genotype 
      (FMR1) (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] 309550; NT011681) and 
      messenger RNA expression. RESULTS: Men with FXTAS had slower tibial nerve 
      conduction velocities and prolonged F-wave latencies compared with controls (z = 
      2.06, P = .04; and z = 2.73, P = .005) and unaffected premutation males (z = 
      1.98, P = .04; and z = 2.00, P = .04). Compound muscle action potential 
      amplitudes were smaller in the FXTAS group relative to controls. Sural nerve 
      action potential amplitudes were reduced in the FXTAS group compared with 
      controls. After controlling for age, there was a significant relationship between 
      the longer CGG repeat number and tibial nerve conduction velocity slowing (r = 
      -0.42, P = .04) and between elevated messenger RNA levels and reduction of the 
      tibial compound muscle action potential velocity (r = -0.52, P = .01) in the 
      permutation group. CONCLUSIONS: Male premutation carriers had significant 
      conduction abnormalities of motor and sensory nerves that correlated with 
      molecular measures, suggesting that the premutation FMR1 genotype is a causal 
      factor. There was also evidence of nerve conduction abnormalities in non-FXTAS 
      carriers compared with controls, which suggests that the neuropathy can occur 
      without the full clinical presentation of FXTAS.

TI  - A single nucleotide variant in the FMR1 CGG repeat results in a "Pseudodeletion" 
      and is not associated with the fragile X syndrome phenotype.
PG  - 272-5
LID - 10.2353/jmoldx.2008.070163 [doi]
AB  - The molecular diagnosis of fragile X syndrome relies on the detection of the 
      pathogenic CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene. Deletions and point mutations 
      have occasionally been reported. Rare polymorphisms might mimic a deletion by 
      Southern blot analysis, leading to false-positive results. We describe a novel 
      rare nucleotide substitution within the CGG repeat. The proband was a woman with 
      a positive family history of mental retardation. Southern blot analysis showed an 
      additional band consistent with a deletion in the region detected by the StB12.3 
      probe. Sequencing of this region revealed a G>C transversion that interrupts the 
      CGG repeat and introduces an EagI site. The same variant was observed in both the 
      healthy son and father of the proband, supporting the hypothesis that the 
      nucleotide substitution is a silent polymorphism, the frequency of which we 
      estimated to be less than 1% in the general population. These findings argue for 
      a pathogenic role of nucleotide variants within the CGG repeat and suggest 
      possible consequences of unexpected findings in the molecular diagnostics of 
      fragile X syndrome. Thus, although the sequence context of a single nucleotide 
      substitution may not predict possible effects on mRNA or protein function, a 
      specific change in the higher order structures of DNA or mRNA may be functionally 
      relevant in the pathological phenotype.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the number of triple CGG expansion of the FMR1 
      (fragile X) gene, known to correlate at premutation (55-200 repeats) and full 
      mutation (>200 repeats) ranges with risk toward premature ovarian failure (POF), 
      also correlates with milder forms of premature ovarian senescence. DESIGN: 
      Retrospective, controlled cohort study. SETTING: Academically affiliated, private 
      fertility center. PATIENT(S): Forty consecutive, new infertility patients, of 
      which 11 presented with a primary diagnosis of repeated pregnancy loss 
      (controls), 23 with prematurely elevated, age-specific baseline follicle 
      stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (i.e., premature ovarian aging, POA) and 6 with 
      POF. INTERVENTION(S): Determination of number of triple CGG repeats on both 
      alleles of FMR1 gene and of FSH and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels as a 
      reflection of ovarian reserve. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Statistical correlation 
      of higher (allele-2) triple repeat counts with patients' clinical diagnoses and 
      with FSH and AMH levels. RESULT(S): Mean triple CGG counts increased in parallel 
      to increasing severity of premature ovarian senescence. Repeat expansion numbers 
      at all levels correlated statistically to FSH. An AMH level of <1.0 ng/mL 
      statistically correlated to >32 triple repeats. CONCLUSION(S): Over 30 triple CGG 
      repeats denote increased risk (and severity) toward premature ovarian senescence 
      in parallel to increasing expansions. Numbers, considered well within the normal 
      range, therefore already denote risk, suggesting that CGG repeats may represent a 
      new test to predict ovarian function and assess female infertility.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of hereditary mental retardation. The 
      molecular basis of this syndrome is mainly a CGG expansion in the 5' untranslated 
      region of the FMR1 gene. Expansions with more than 200 CGG repeats abolish gene 
      expression causing the classical fragile X phenotype. Premutation carriers 
      (55-200 CGG) have normal cognitive function with increased risk of developing 
      premature ovarian failure and fragile X-associated tremor-ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS). Some clinical features associated with FXTAS, such as tremor, gait 
      ataxia, cognitive decline, and generalized brain atrophy, are also seen in other 
      movement disorders. Ninety-five patients referred for HD, who tested negative for 
      the expansion in the IT15 gene, were screened for FMR1 CGG-repeat expansion. One 
      FMR1 premutation male carrier was detected, giving an FXTAS frequency of 1.6%. 
      Our results highlight that FXTAS is still not well diagnosed; therefore, we 
      recommend FMR1 premutation screenings in all patients with late-onset tremor, 
      ataxia, and cognitive dysfunction.

      fragile X prenatal diagnosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To document fragile X allele frequencies in a national referral 
      population and evaluate CGG repeat expansion in mother-offspring transmissions. 
      METHODS: Fragile X DNA analysis by Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction 
      was completed for 14,675 women, aged 18 years or older, and 238 mother-offspring 
      pairs between January 1999 and June 2004. Carrier frequencies were compared 
      between groups referred for different clinical indications. Direct comparison of 
      the FMR1 gene CGG repeat size in mother-offspring pairs determined intermediate 
      and premutation allele stability. RESULTS: Intermediate fragile X alleles (45-54 
      CGG repeats) occurred in 257 (1 in 57). The combined total number of patients 
      with a premutation (55-200 CGG repeats) or full mutation (more than 200 CGG 
      repeats) numbered 208 (1 in 71). One in 3.5 women with a family history of 
      fragile X and 1 in 10 with premature ovarian failure had a FMR1 mutation. This 
      compared with 1 in 86 for those with a family history of mental retardation and 1 
      in 257 for women with no known risk factors for fragile X. Among 238 
      mother-offspring pairings, the smallest allele to expand to a full mutation in 
      one generation contained 60 CGG repeats. Although 6.6% (4 of 60) of intermediate 
      repeat alleles did expand, none jumped to a clinically significant full 
      mutation-sized allele. CONCLUSION: Based on these data and other published 
      literature, offering invasive prenatal diagnosis for fragile X syndrome is not 
      indicated for women with intermediate alleles. Invasive prenatal diagnosis is 
      warranted for those women with a fragile X allele containing 55 or more CGG 
      repeats.

TI  - Impact of the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene premutation on 
      neuropsychiatric functioning in adult males without fragile X-associated 
      Tremor/Ataxia syndrome: a controlled study.
PG  - 859-72
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.30685 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X Syndrome is the most common heritable form of mental retardation caused 
      by silencing of the FMR1 gene, which arises from intergenerational trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion leading to full mutation. An intermediary carrier condition, 
      known as the premutation, is characterized by expansion up to 200 repeats without 
      concomitant gene silencing. This prevalent allelic variant was initially thought 
      to be free of phenotypic effects. However, recent reports have identified a 
      degenerative disease, Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) in 
      older men as well as premature ovarian failure in women. Previously reports are 
      inconsistent regarding the neuropsychiatric phenotype associated with premutation 
      due to small sample sizes, ascertainment bias, lack of adequate control groups, 
      administration of measures with poor psychometric properties, and the confounding 
      effects of FXTAS. We addressed these problems by conducting a controlled study of 
      male carriers (n = 40) of the premutation without manifest symptoms of FXTAS, 
      comparing their responses on specific, reliable, and valid measures of 
      neuropsychiatric functioning to those of individuals with shared family 
      environment (n = 22) and non-carrier comparison males (n = 43). Multivariate 
      analyses revealed that the premutation confers significant risk for working 
      memory difficulties, an associated feature of Attention-Deficit Disorder. 
      Furthermore, both the family controls and men with premutation exhibited higher 
      rates of Alcohol Abuse as compared to non-carrier control men. These findings 
      highlight the importance of recognizing the distinct phenotypic outcomes that 
      characterize the Fragile X premutation and the subtle risk factors that can act 
      as precursors to more significant psychiatric impairment.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome, which is caused by expansion of a (CGG)(n) repeat in the FMR1 
      gene, occurs in approximately 1:3500 males and causes mental 
      retardation/behavioral problems. Smaller (CGG)(n) repeat expansions in FMR1, 
      premutations, are associated with premature ovarian failure and fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. An FMR1-sizing assay is technically 
      challenging because of high GC content of the (CGG)(n) repeat, the size 
      limitations of conventional PCR, and a lack of reference materials available for 
      test development/validation and routine quality control. The Centers for Disease 
      Control and Prevention and the Association for Molecular Pathology, together with 
      the genetic testing community, have addressed the need for characterized fragile 
      X mutation reference materials by developing characterized DNA samples from 16 
      cell lines with repeat lengths representing important phenotypic classes and 
      diagnostic cutoffs. The alleles in these materials were characterized by 
      consensus analysis in nine clinical laboratories. The information generated from 
      this study is available on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 
      Coriell Cell Repositories websites. DNA purified from these cell lines is 
      available to the genetics community through the Coriell Cell Repositories. The 
      public availability of these reference materials should help support accurate 
      clinical fragile X syndrome testing.

TI  - ATR protects the genome against CGG.CCG-repeat expansion in Fragile X premutation 
      mice.
PG  - 1050-6
AB  - Fragile X mental retardation syndrome is a repeat expansion disease caused by 
      expansion of a CGG.CCG-repeat tract in the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene. In humans, 
      small expansions occur more frequently on paternal transmission while large 
      expansions are exclusively maternal in origin. It has been suggested that 
      expansion is the result of aberrant DNA replication, repair or recombination. To 
      distinguish amongst these possibilities we crossed mice containing 120 
      CGG.CCG-repeats in the 5' UTR of the mouse Fmr1 gene to mice with mutations in 
      ATR, a protein important in the cellular response to stalled replication forks 
      and bulky DNA lesions. We show here that ATR heterozygosity results in increased 
      expansion rates of maternally, but not paternally, transmitted alleles. In 
      addition, age-related somatic expansions occurred in mice of both genders that 
      were not seen in ATR wild-type animals. Some ATR-sensitive expansion occurs in 
      postmitotic cells including haploid gametes suggesting that aberrant DNA repair 
      is responsible. Our data suggest that two mechanisms of repeat expansion exist 
      that may explain the small and large expansions seen in humans. In addition, our 
      data provide an explanation for the maternal bias of large expansions in humans 
      and the lower incidence of these expansions in mice.

TI  - Volumetric brain changes in females with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome (FXTAS).
PG  - 851-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder occurring in male and rare female carriers of a 
      premutation expansion (55 to 200 CGG repeats) of the fragile X mental retardation 
      1 (FMR1) gene. METHODS: Volumetric MRI studies, clinical staging, cognitive 
      testing, and molecular analysis were conducted in 15 female premutation carriers 
      affected by FXTAS (age 59.5 +/- 10.3 years), 20 unaffected female carriers (43.3 
      +/- 11.2 years), 11 genetically normal female controls (51.0 +/- 10.3 years), 36 
      affected male carriers (65.0 +/- 5.6 years), 25 unaffected male carriers (53.5 
      +/- 12.5 years), and 39 male controls (58.0 +/- 15.0 years). Female and male 
      carriers with FXTAS were matched on duration of disease. RESULTS: We found less 
      pronounced reductions of cerebellar volume and a lower incidence of involvement 
      (symmetric high T2 signal) of the middle cerebellar peduncles (MCP sign) in 
      females affected by FXTAS (13%) compared with affected males (58%). We found 
      reduced brain volumes and increased white matter disease associated with the 
      presence of FXTAS in females compared with female controls. We also observed 
      significant associations between reduced cerebellar volume and both increased 
      severity of FXTAS symptoms and increased length of the CGG repeat expansion in 
      male premutation carriers, but not in females. CONCLUSIONS: Females affected by 
      fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) demonstrated milder brain 
      changes than affected males, although they showed a similar pattern of radiologic 
      findings consistent with brain atrophy and white matter disease. FXTAS should be 
      considered (by ordering fragile X DNA testing) in females who present with 
      late-onset ataxia, action tremor, or neuropathy, particularly in those with a 
      family history of mental retardation, autism, or premature ovarian failure.

TI  - Closely linked cis-acting modifier of expansion of the CGG repeat in high risk 
      FMR1 haplotypes.
PG  - 1216-24
AB  - In its expanded form, the fragile X triplet repeat at Xq27.3 gives rise to the 
      most common form of inherited mental retardation, fragile X syndrome. This high 
      population frequency persists despite strong selective pressure against 
      mutation-bearing chromosomes. Males carrying the full mutation rarely reproduce 
      and females heterozygous for the premutation allele are at risk of premature 
      ovarian failure. Our diagnostic facility and previous research have provided a 
      large databank of X chromosomes that have been tested for the FRAXA allele. Using 
      this resource, we have conducted a detailed genetic association study of the 
      FRAXA region to determine any cis-acting factors that predispose to expansion of 
      the CGG triplet repeat. We have genotyped SNP variants across a 650-kb tract 
      centered on FRAXA in a sample of 877 expanded and normal X chromosomes. These 
      chromosomes were selected to be representative of the haplotypic diversity 
      encountered in our population. We found expansion status to be strongly 
      associated with a approximately 50-kb region proximal to the fragile site. 
      Subsequent detailed analyses of this region revealed no specific genetic 
      determinants for the whole population. However, stratification of chromosomes by 
      risk subgroups enabled us to identify a common SNP variant which cosegregates 
      with the subset of D group haplotypes at highest risk of expansion 
      (chi(1)(2)=17.84, p=0.00002). We have verified that this SNP acts as a marker of 
      repeat expansion in three independent samples.

      repeat.
PG  - 2326-32
AB  - Fragile X Syndrome is the most common form of hereditary mental retardation. It 
      is caused by a large expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat (>200 repeats) in 
      the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of the FMR1 gene that leads to silencing of its 
      transcript. Individuals with CGG repeat expansions approximately between 60 and 
      200 are referred to as premutation carriers. Fragile X-associated tremor and 
      ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), an RNA-mediated neurodegenerative disease has been 
      described in up to 50% of males carrying premutation alleles. FRAXE, the most 
      common form of non-syndromic X-linked mental retardation, is caused by expansion 
      of a CCG trinucleotide repeat (>200) in the 5'-UTR of the FMR2 gene. While the 
      FRAXE premutation length repeat is observed in the general population, there has 
      not yet been a report of a neurodegenerative phenotype associated with these 
      alleles. In this study, we show that the CCG premutation length repeat leads to 
      an RNA-mediated neurodegenerative phenotype in a Drosophila model. Furthermore, 
      we show that co-expression of both the CCG and CGG-containing RNAs suppresses 
      their independent toxicity and is dependent on the RNAi pathway. These data 
      support the concept that RNA toxicity is the mechanism of neuronal toxicity and 
      suggests potential reversal of RNA-mediated phenotypes with complementary RNA 
      molecules.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated patients with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS), a neurodegenerative disorder associated with a CGG repeat expansion in 
      the premutation range in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. METHODS: 
      Neurological, psychiatric and neuropsychological evaluations were performed on 15 
      male patients with FXTAS. RESULTS: Seven cases were diagnosed with dementia, and 
      seven others were diagnosed with mood and/or anxiety disorders. Twelve subjects 
      demonstrated deficits on neuropsychological testing. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians 
      assessing dementia patients are urged to consider this newly described syndrome, 
      especially in patients with dementia associated with a movement disorder and in 
      those with a family history of mental retardation. If FXTAS is a possible 
      diagnosis, physicians may carry out FMR1 DNA testing; patients who test positive 
      on DNA testing should undergo magnetic resonance imaging, be referred to 
      neurology and receive genetic counseling.

TI  - Regional FMRP deficits and large repeat expansions into the full mutation range 
      in a new Fragile X premutation mouse model.
PG  - 125-34
AB  - Carriers of FMR1 alleles with 55-200 repeats in the 5' UTR are at risk for 
      Fragile X associated tremor and ataxia syndrome. The cause of the neuropathology 
      is unknown but is thought to be RNA-mediated. Maternally transmitted premutation 
      alleles are also at risk of expansion of the repeat tract into the "full 
      mutation" range (>200 repeats). The mechanism responsible for expansion is 
      unknown. Full mutation alleles produce reduced amounts of the FMR1 gene product, 
      FMRP, which leads to Fragile X mental retardation syndrome. We have developed a 
      murine model for Fragile X premutation carriers that recapitulates key features 
      seen in humans including a direct relationship between repeat number and Fmr1 
      mRNA levels, an inverse relationship with FMRP levels and Purkinje cell dropout 
      that have not been seen in a previously described knock-in mouse model. In 
      addition, these mice also show a differential deficit of FMRP in different parts 
      of the brain that might account for symptoms of the full mutation that are seen 
      in premutation carriers. As in humans, repeat instability is high with expansions 
      predominating and, for the first time in a mouse model, large expansions into the 
      full mutation range are seen that occur within a single generation. Thus, 
      contrary to what was previously thought, mice may be good models not only for the 
      symptoms seen in human carriers of FMR1 premutation alleles but also for 
      understanding the mechanism responsible for repeat expansion, a phenomenon that 
      is responsible for a number of neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders.

TI  - CGG repeat length correlates with age of onset of motor signs of the fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).
PG  - 566-9
AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset neurological 
      disorder among carriers of premutation CGG-repeat expansions within the FMR1 
      gene. Principal features of FXTAS include progressive action tremor and gait 
      ataxia, with associated features of parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy, 
      dysautonomia, and cognitive decline. Although both clinical and neuropathologic 
      features of FXTAS are known to be highly associated with CGG repeat length, the 
      relationship between repeat length and age-of-onset is not known. To address this 
      issue, the ages of onset of action tremor and gait ataxia were documented by 
      history for 93 male carriers. For this cohort, the mean ages of onset were 62.6 
      +/- 8.1 years (range, 39-78 years) for tremor, and 63.6 +/- 7.3 years (range, 
      47-78 years) for ataxia; the mean CGG repeat number was 88.5 +/- 14 (range, 
      60-133). Analysis of the relationship between clinical onset and molecular 
      measures revealed significant correlations between CGG repeat number and onset of 
      both tremor (P = 0.001) and ataxia (P = 0.002), as well as overall onset (P < 
      0.0001). Our findings indicate that the CGG repeat number is a potential 
      predictor of the age of onset of core motor features of FXTAS.

TI  - Attitudes toward fragile X mutation carrier testing from women identified in a 
      general population survey.
PG  - 97-104
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is primarily due to a CGG repeat expansion found in the FMR1 
      X-linked gene. In a previous study, we conducted focus groups with women to 
      assess their attitudes towards fragile X carrier screening. In this follow-up 
      study, we conducted in-depth interviews of general population reproductive-age 
      women who were identified as carriers. We explored their attitudes toward testing 
      for carrier status of the fragile X mutation. These women underwent screening 
      primarily to participate in a research project rather than in search of a 
      diagnosis for specific symptoms. As such, these women were wholly unprepared for 
      positive carrier results. Their responses about their results and carrier 
      screening, in many cases, were being worked out over the course of the interview 
      itself. The most salient finding of this work is the apparent lack of relevance 
      of carrier status to these women. Many expressed that although the information 
      could be relevant in the future, it is not relevant at this stage of their lives 
      in terms of family planning (either with respect to having unaffected offspring 
      or to premature ovarian failure) and personal relationships. Although issues of 
      abortion seemed prominent in the focus groups, we found that carrier status did 
      not have an apparent effect on women's attitudes about termination. We 
      hypothesize this may be related to the fact that women had not processed their 
      new carrier status and had not related it to previously-formed personal opinions. 
      The findings of this work have significant implications for genetic counseling 
      and population screening. Genetic counselors should be mindful that general 
      population women may not recognize the immediate importance of their carrier 
      status even when literature is provided and discussed prior to providing a 
      sample. As part of comprehensive genetic counseling, counselors should identify 
      the reproductive life stage of the woman receiving the new information and help 
      her identify when this information would be more meaningful in her life. 
      Counselors can assist in setting up a personalized road map with specific types 
      of services that will be more applicable to the woman as her carrier status 
      becomes more relevant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A 76-year-old man presented with an 8-year history of balance 
      problems and a 2-year history of short-term memory loss. He had also been 
      experiencing long-term problems with impotence and episodes of urinary 
      incontinence, and had been managed for hypertension for 25 years. His medical 
      history was otherwise unremarkable. Three of his grandchildren had been diagnosed 
      with fragile X syndrome. INVESTIGATIONS: Neurological examination, cognitive and 
      neuropsychological testing, nerve conduction studies, MRI, and genetic testing. 
      DIAGNOSIS: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) resulting from a 
      premutation (CGG repeat) expansion of the FMR1 gene. MANAGEMENT: Explanation of 
      the genetic ramifications of premutation carrier status for the FMR1 gene, and 
      symptomatic treatment for the clinical difficulties experienced by the patient.

TI  - Impairment of executive cognitive functioning in males with fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome.
PG  - 645-50
AB  - The fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a recently identified 
      phenotype associated with trinucleotide repeat expansions in the premutation 
      range of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. In addition to 
      progressive gait ataxia, action tremor, peripheral neuropathy, and parkinsonism, 
      FXTAS involves impaired cognition. Our preliminary research suggests that 
      executive cognitive functioning (ECF) is especially affected. In this study, a 
      brief neuropsychological exam was administered to 33 men with FXTAS and 27 
      healthy controls. Compared with controls, individuals with FXTAS showed 
      statistically significant impairments on measures from the Wechsler Adult 
      Intelligence Scale, third edition (WAIS-III; verbal IQ, performance [nonverbal] 
      IQ, verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, and processing speed). FXTAS 
      subjects scored significantly lower on three of four measures of ECF and on two 
      tests of information processing speed. The results provide evidence that FXTAS 
      involves impairment of general intellectual functioning, with marked impairment 
      of executive cognitive abilities. The pattern of cognitive performance is 
      somewhat similar to that observed in the frontal variant of frontotemporal 
      dementia and several of the spinocerebellar ataxias, but differs from the 
      deficits observed in dementia of the Alzheimer type.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess changes in regional brain volumes associated with the 
      fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and the molecular correlates 
      of these changes. METHODS: We administered molecular, MRI, and neurocognitive 
      tests to 36 male premutation carriers (ages 51 to 79), 25 affected and 11 
      unaffected with FXTAS, and to 21 control subjects of similar age and education. 
      RESULTS: We found differences among the three groups in whole brain, cerebrum, 
      cerebellum, ventricular volume, and whole-brain white matter hyperintensity, with 
      the affected group showing significantly more pathology than the control and 
      unaffected groups. Brainstem volume was significantly smaller in the unaffected 
      group vs controls but did not differ from the affected group. Within the 
      premutation sample, CGG repeat length correlated with reductions in IQ and 
      cerebellar volume and increased ventricular volume and whole-brain white matter 
      hyperintensity. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings, coupled with recent evidence 
      linking the degree of neuropathology (numbers of intranuclear inclusions) to the 
      size of the premutation allele, provide evidence that the neurodegenerative 
      phenotype in the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome is a consequence of 
      the CGG repeat expansion.

PG  - 227-33
AB  - Disorders associated with fragile X syndrome involve a trinucleotide (CGG) repeat 
      expansion in the FMR1 gene. Recently, a progressive movement disorder (fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome [FXTAS]) has been identified in premutation 
      carriers, persons with 55 to 200 CGG repeats. In addition to ataxia, action 
      tremor, and Parkinsonism, early case reports suggested that FXTAS involves 
      impaired cognition, but the precise nature of the impairment has not been 
      elucidated. In this first, preliminary study of the subject, circumscribed 
      aspects of cognitive functioning were examined in 25 men with FXTAS. Subjects' 
      performance on the cognitive tests was compared with normative data. Scores on 
      two measures of executive cognitive functioning showed a high prevalence of 
      substantial impairment. Capacity for inhibition was severely affected in 
      one-quarter of this highly educated sample; information processing speed was 
      profoundly impaired in most subjects. Although mean verbal and performance IQ 
      scores were not significantly different from the general population, they were 
      quite low given the sample's educational level. Cognitive and functional 
      impairment was greater for men with more CGG repeats, although number of repeats 
      was not associated with age of onset of either tremor or ataxia. The results 
      provide evidence that FXTAS involves marked impairment of executive cognitive 
      abilities.

      alleles of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene.
PG  - 605-12
AB  - Several diagnostic strategies have been applied to the detection of FMR1 gene 
      repeat expansions in fragile X syndrome. Here, we report a novel polymerase chain 
      reaction-based strategy using the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche 
      Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and the osmolyte betaine. Repeat expansions up to 
      approximately 330 CGGs in males and up to at least approximately 160 CGGs in 
      carrier women could be easily visualized on ethidium bromide agarose gels. We 
      also demonstrated that fluorescence analysis of polymerase chain reaction 
      products was a reliable tool to verify the presence of premutation and full 
      mutation alleles both in males and in females. This technique, primarily designed 
      to detect premutation alleles, can be used as a routine first screen for expanded 
      FMR1 alleles.

TI  - Unfolding of higher DNA structures formed by the d(CGG) triplet repeat by UP1 
      protein.
PG  - 953-62
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is caused by expansion of a d(CGG) triplet repeat in the 
      5'-untranslated region of the first exon of the FMR1 gene resulting in silencing 
      of the gene. The d(CGG) repeat has been reported to form hairpin and quadruplex 
      structures in vitro, and formation of these higher structures could be 
      responsible for its unstable expansion in the syndrome, although molecular 
      mechanisms underlying the repeat expansion still remain elusive. We have 
      previously proved that UP1, a proteolytic product of hnRNP A1, unfolds the 
      intramolecular quadruplex structures of d(GGCAG)5 and d(TTAGGG)4 and abrogates 
      the arrest of DNA synthesis at d(GGG)n sites. Here, we demonstrate that the 
      d(CGG) repeat forms a peculiar DNA structure, which deviates from the canonical 
      B-form structure. In addition, UP1 was demonstrated by CD spectrum analysis to 
      unfold this characteristic higher structure of the d(CGG) repeat and to abrogate 
      the arrest of DNA synthesis at the site. This ability of UP1 suggests that 
      unfolding of unusual DNA structures of a triplet repeat is required for DNA 
      synthesis processes.

TI  - Women's attitudes toward testing for fragile X carrier status: a qualitative 
      analysis.
PG  - 295-306
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is primarily due to a repeat expansion mutation found in 
      the FMR1 X-linked gene. We have conducted a qualitative analysis of responses 
      from women concerning their attitudes toward testing for carrier status of the 
      fragile X mutation among reproductive-age women. We obtained responses from focus 
      groups including women with and without FXS in their families. We found the 
      following themes: (1) mothers of children with FXS have difficulty formulating 
      their opinions on population screening because of their unique experiences 
      surrounding their own carrier diagnosis and their relationship with their 
      children with FXS, (2) the motivation for carrier testing and need for 
      information differ by family history of FXS and parental status, and (3) the 
      timing of carrier testing with respect to a woman's life stage dictates whether 
      carrier information will be viewed as beneficial or detrimental. There was 
      evidence that non-carrier women from the general population would be wholly 
      unprepared for positive carrier results. These findings have significant 
      implications for genetic counseling as well as for population screening.

TI  - Genetic counseling for fragile x syndrome: updated recommendations of the 
      national society of genetic counselors.
PG  - 249-70
AB  - These recommendations describe the minimum standard criteria for genetic 
      counseling and testing of individuals and families with fragile X syndrome, as 
      well as carriers and potential carriers of a fragile X mutation. The original 
      guidelines (published in 2000) have been revised, replacing a stratified pre- and 
      full mutation model of fragile X syndrome with one based on a continuum of gene 
      effects across the full spectrum of FMR1 CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion. This 
      document reviews the molecular genetics of fragile X syndrome, clinical phenotype 
      (including the spectrum of premature ovarian failure and fragile X-associated 
      tremor-ataxia syndrome), indications for genetic testing and interpretation of 
      results, risks of transmission, family planning options, psychosocial issues, and 
      references for professional and patient resources. These recommendations are the 
      opinions of a multicenter working group of genetic counselors with expertise in 
      fragile X syndrome genetic counseling, and they are based on clinical experience, 
      review of pertinent English language articles, and reports of expert committees. 
      These recommendations should not be construed as dictating an exclusive course of 
      management, nor does use of such recommendations guarantee a particular outcome. 
      The professional judgment of a health care provider, familiar with the facts and 
      circumstances of a specific case, will always supersede these recommendations.

TI  - Cognitive decline, neuromotor and behavioural disturbances in a mouse model for 
      fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).
PG  - 233-9
AB  - Carriers of premutation alleles (55-200 CGG repeats) of the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are spared the major neurodevelopmental symptomatology 
      of fragile X syndrome patients carrying a full mutation (>200 repeats). In a 
      proportion of premutation carriers, the repeat expansion is associated with a 
      specific neurological profile involving intention tremor, ataxia, intellectual 
      decline compatible with dementia syndrome, Parkinsonism and autonomic dysfunction 
      at older age, commonly referred to as fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS). Typical CNS changes include hyperintense signals on T2 weighted magnetic 
      resonance images and the presence of ubiquitin-positive intranuclear neuronal 
      inclusions. A knock-in mouse model with a (CGG)98 repeat in the premutation range 
      has been generated and shown to exhibit elevated Fmr1 mRNA levels and 
      ubiquitin-positive intranuclear neuronal inclusions, suggesting it may be a valid 
      model for the human disease. Given the specific clinical profile of FXTAS 
      patients, the expanded CGG repeat model was assessed for cognitive, behavioural 
      and neuromotor performance at different ages (20, 52 and 72 weeks). The Morris 
      water maze task exposed age-dependent decline of visual-spatial memory. Open 
      field recordings revealed decreased exploration of the centre of the arena in the 
      oldest group of expanded CGG repeat mice, potentially reflecting increased 
      anxiety. Neuromotor tasks primarily showed decline of performance on the 
      accelerating rotarod with age in the premutation carriers but not in control 
      littermates. The age-dependent cognitive decline and neuromotor disturbances may 
      be related to the progressive cognitive and behavioural difficulties observed in 
      FXTAS patients.

TI  - Evidence for, and a spectrum of, neurological involvement in carriers of the 
      fragile X pre-mutation: FXTAS and beyond.
PG  - 412-7
AB  - A neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS), occurs in some older men carrying a small CGG repeat expansion 
      (pre-mutation) in the FMR1 gene. We surveyed a sample of older pre-mutation males 
      to estimate the prevalence and spectrum of neurological involvement. Twelve 
      pre-mutation males aged 50-82 years and 11 age-matched normal controls 
      ascertained in an unbiased manner were included in a neurological assessment that 
      also used standard scales for tremor (Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor), ataxia 
      (International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale, ICARS) and parkinsonian signs 
      (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale). Axial FLAIR images of the brain, and 
      neuropsychological and molecular tests were also conducted in pre-mutation 
      carriers. The neurological disorder meeting all the criteria for diagnosis of 
      'definite' to 'possible' FXTAS occurred in five of 12 pre-mutation carriers 
      (41.7%), and this prevalence was significantly higher compared with normal 
      controls (0%). The ataxia (ICARS) score and the sum of all three tremor/ataxia 
      scores were significantly higher in pre-mutation carriers than in controls, and 
      mRNA was elevated in all but one carrier, but did not correlate with the degree 
      of neurological involvement. In conclusion, the findings provide further evidence 
      that the pre-mutation allele of FMR1 is a significant cause of late-onset 
      neurodegeneration, presenting with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations.

TI  - Differential epigenetic modifications in the FMR1 gene of the fragile X syndrome 
      after reactivating pharmacological treatments.
PG  - 641-8
AB  - The fragile X syndrome is caused by a >200 CGG repeat expansion within the FMR1 
      gene promoter, with consequent DNA hypermethylation and inactivation of its 
      expression. To further clarify the mechanisms that suppress the activity of the 
      mutant gene and the conditions that may permit its reactivation, we investigated 
      the acetylation and methylation status of three different regions of the FMR1 
      gene (promoter, exon 1 and exon 16) of three fragile X cell lines, using a 
      chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay with antibodies against 
      acetylated-H3/H4 histones and against dimethylated lysine residues K4 and K9 of 
      histone H3 (H3-K4 and H3-K9). We then coupled the ChIP assay with real-time PCR, 
      obtaining absolute quantification of immunoprecipitated chromatin. Basal levels 
      of histone acetylation and H3-K4 methylation were much higher in 
      transcriptionally active wild-type controls than in inactive fragile X cell 
      lines. Treatment of fragile X cell lines with the DNA demethylating drug 
      5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-azadC), known to reactivate the FMR1 gene, induced a 
      decrease of H3-K9 methylation, an increase of H3 and H4 acetylation and an 
      increase of H3-K4 methylation. Treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC), a 
      compound that reduces the in vitro expression of the FRAXA fragile site without 
      affecting DNA methylation, caused an increase of H3 and H4 acetylation. However, 
      H3-K4 methylation remained extremely low, in accordance with the observation that 
      ALC alone does not reactivate the FMR1 gene. Our experiments indicate that H3-K4 
      methylation and DNA demethylation are the main epigenetic switches activating the 
      expression of the FMR1 gene, with histone acetylation playing an ancillary role.

TI  - Neural progenitor cells from an adult patient with fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 2
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no adequate animal model to study the detailed 
      molecular biochemistry of fragile X syndrome, the leading heritable form of 
      mental impairment. In this study, we sought to establish the use of immature 
      neural cells derived from adult tissues as a novel model of fragile X syndrome 
      that could be used to more fully understand the pathology of this neurogenetic 
      disease. METHODS: By modifying published methods for the harvest of neural 
      progenitor cells from the post-mortem human brain, neural cells were successfully 
      harvested and grown from post-mortem brain tissue of a 25-year-old adult male 
      with fragile X syndrome, and from brain tissue of a patient with no neurological 
      disease. RESULTS: The cultured fragile X cells displayed many of the 
      characteristics of neural progenitor cells, including nestin and CD133 
      expression, as well as the biochemical hallmarks of fragile X syndrome, including 
      CGG repeat expansion and a lack of FMRP expression. CONCLUSION: The successful 
      production of neural cells from an individual with fragile X syndrome opens a new 
      avenue for the scientific study of the molecular basis of this disorder, as well 
      as an approach for studying the efficacy of new therapeutic agents.

TI  - The effect of pre-mutation of X chromosome CGG trinucleotide repeats on brain 
      anatomy.
PG  - 2672-81
AB  - Expanded trinucleotide repeats are associated with several neuropsychiatric 
      disorders, including fragile X syndrome (FraX) which is the most common inherited 
      form of mental retardation. It is currently thought that FraX results from having 
      >200 CGG trinucleotide repeats, with consequent methylation of the fragile X 
      mental retardation gene (FMR1) and loss of FMR1 protein (FMRP). Pre-mutation 
      carriers of FraX (with 55-200 CGG trinucleotide repeats) were originally 
      considered unaffected, although recent studies challenge this view. However, 
      there are few studies on the effect of pre-mutation trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion on the male human brain using quantitative MRI. Also the results of 
      prior investigations may be confounded because people were selected on the basis 
      of clinical and neurological features, and not genetic phenotype. We compared the 
      brain anatomy of 20 adult male pre-mutation members of known FraX families with 
      20 healthy male controls. The two groups did not differ significantly in age, 
      intelligence quotient (IQ) or handedness. We also investigated whether any 
      observed effects were associated with: (i) ageing; (ii) expansion of pre-mutation 
      CGG trinucleotide repeats; (iii) reduction in the percentage of lymphocytes 
      staining with anti-FMRP antibodies [%FMRP(+) lymphocytes]; and (iv) elevation of 
      FMR1 mRNA levels. Male pre-mutation carriers of FraX, compared with matched 
      controls, had significantly less voxel density in several brain regions, 
      including the cerebellum, amygdalo-hippocampal complex and thalamus. Within 
      pre-mutation carriers of FraX, ageing, increases in the number of CGG 
      trinucleotide repeats and decreases in %FMRP(+) lymphocytes were associated with 
      decreasing voxel density of regions previously identified as decreased relative 
      to controls. Regional grey and white matter density is significantly affected in 
      male pre-mutation carriers of FraX recruited on the basis of genetic, not 
      clinical, phenotype. The association of voxel density reduction and ageing is 
      consistent with observations of a subgroup of older pre-mutation males who 
      present with cognitive decline. Moreover, our findings suggest, for the first 
      time, an association between voxel density reduction and genetic variation in 
      FraX.

TI  - Loss of FMR1 hypermethylation in somatic cell heterokaryons.
PG  - 1964-6
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is associated with a trinucleotide (CGG) repeat expansion in 
      the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene and hypermethylation of the FMR1 
      promoter. Rare cases of clinically normal males (HFM) have been identified with 
      an expanded CGG repeat; however, here, the FMR1 promoter is not methylated. Using 
      classical complementation (cell fusion) studies, we analyzed if possible 
      differences in the genetic background between HFM and cells from individuals with 
      fragile X syndrome (FX cells) could have an influence on the methylation status 
      of the FMR1 promoter. We observed that demethylation of the hypermethylated FMR1 
      promoter can occur when FX cells are complemented (by cell fusion) with cells 
      from HFM as well as with cells from control individuals. The observed 
      demethylation is specific and can happen without DNA replication. In contrast, 
      demethylation was not observed when cells from unrelated individuals with fragile 
      X syndrome were fused, indicating that FX cells have lost the necessary factor(s) 
      to demethylate the aberrantly methylated FMR1 promoter.

TI  - Association and transmission analysis of the FMR1 IVS10 + 14C-T variant in 
      autism.
PG  - 54-6
AB  - Evidence from the high male to female ratio of individuals with autism as well as 
      suggestive linkage data have implicated the possible involvement of X chromosomal 
      loci in the aetiology of autism. Studies of the FMR1 gene on Xq27 have shown that 
      occasionally individuals, and particularly females, with the [CGG] repeat 
      expansion and methylation mutation may present with autistic symptoms. However, 
      molecular studies suggest that such mutations are not a major cause of autism. 
      Previously, we have screened autism probands for mutations in regions of the FMR1 
      gene downstream of the [CGG] repeat and identified an intronic variant in the 
      FMR1 gene, IVS10 + 14C-T, which was present at a significantly higher frequency 
      in autistic individuals compared to controls individuals. We have now 
      investigated this variant in a further 136 autism families and 186 control 
      individuals. We have established that the variant is significantly more frequent 
      among East Asian individuals within our affected and control groups (P < 0.0001) 
      and although we observed a trend of higher transmission frequency of the rare 
      allele to affected individuals, there was no significant evidence in either 
      family-based or case/control association studies for this variant in autism (P > 
      0.05).

TI  - Redistribution of transcription start sites within the FMR1 promoter region with 
      expansion of the downstream CGG-repeat element.
PG  - 543-9
AB  - Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of mental impairment, is caused by 
      expansion of a (CGG)n trinucleotide repeat element located in the 5' untranslated 
      region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Repeat expansion is 
      known to influence both transcription and translation; however, the mechanisms by 
      which the CGG element exerts its effects are not known. In the current work, we 
      have utilized 5'-RLM-RACE to examine the influence of CGG repeat number on the 
      utilization of transcription start sites in normal (n<55) and premutation 
      (54<n<200) cell lines of both non-neural (lymphoblastoid) and neural (primary 
      astrocyte) origin. Our results demonstrate that, in both neural and non-neural 
      cells, transcription of the FMR1 gene is initiated from several transcription 
      start sites within a approximately 50 nt region that lies approximately 130 nt 
      upstream of the CGG repeat element. For normal alleles, most transcripts initiate 
      from the downstream-most start site, close to the single position identified 
      previously. Surprisingly, as the size of the CGG repeat expands into the 
      premutation range, initiation shifts to the upstream sites, suggesting that the 
      CGG element may act as a downstream enhancer/modulator of transcription. The 
      shift in start site selection for both neural and non-neural cells indicates that 
      the effect is general. Furthermore, the correspondence between start site 
      utilization and the degree of elevation of FMR1 mRNA suggests that a substantial 
      fraction of the increased message in the premutation range may derive from the 
      upstream start sites.

TI  - MECP2 analysis in mentally retarded patients: implications for routine DNA 
      diagnostics.
PG  - 24-8
AB  - Rett syndrome (RTT) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in 
      females. The disease is caused by mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 
      gene (MECP2), and various mutations have been reported. The phenotypic spectrum 
      in both female and male patients is diverse, ranging from very mild to congenital 
      encephalopathy and prenatal lethality. In this study, the question was addressed 
      as to whether implementation of systematic screening of MECP2 in patients with an 
      unexplained mental retardation in DNA diagnostics would be reasonable, and the 
      spectrum of phenotypes resulting from mutations in this gene was further 
      explored. Mutational analysis of MECP2 was performed in mentally retarded female 
      patients who were negative for FMR1 CGG repeat expansion, in male and female 
      patients with clinical features suggestive of either Angelman or Prader-Willi 
      syndrome without methylation defects on chromosome 15q11-q13. In the cohort of 
      females negative for the molecular Fragile-X studies (N=92), one nonsense 
      mutation (p.Q406X) was found. In the cohort of Angelman-negative patients (N=63), 
      two missense mutations (p.R133C in a female patient and a mosaic p.T158M in a 
      male patient) were found, which have been reported many times in patients with 
      classical RTT syndrome. In the Prader-Willi-negative group (N=98), no pathogenic 
      mutations were found. The results support testing of patients with features 
      suggestive of Angelman syndrome, but without methylation defects on chromosome 
      15q11-q13 for mutations in MECP2. In the remaining patients with unexplained 
      mental retardation, additional clinical features should determine whether 
      analysis of MECP2 is indicated.

TI  - DNA deamination enables direct PCR amplification of the cystatin B (CSTB) 
      gene-associated dodecamer repeat expansion in myoclonus epilepsy type 
      Unverricht-Lundborg.
PG  - 404-8
AB  - The Unverricht-Lundborg type of progressive myoclonus epilepsy (EPM1) is an 
      autosomal recessive disorder that is caused by the dysfunction of the cystatin B 
      (CSTB) gene product. In the vast majority of affected cases, mRNA transcription 
      is impaired by a biallelic expansion of a dodecamer repeat within the 
      5'-untranslated region of the respective gene. Since this minisatellite contains 
      exclusively G and C nucleotides, direct PCR analysis of allele expansion is 
      extremely difficult and error prone. To circumvent these problems, we have 
      developed a PCR assay that is based on the deamination of the DNA prior to 
      amplification. We have developed a method based on PCR after DNA deamination of 
      the GC-rich repeat region, which improves the PCR condition to such an extent 
      that we were not only able to reliably amplify expanded alleles of affected 
      individuals (homozygotes and compound heterozygotes), but also the two alleles of 
      full mutation carriers, whose analysis is particularly difficult because of PCR 
      bias and heteroduplex formation between the two alleles. We used promoter- and 
      repeat-specific primer combinations to investigate whether dodecamer repeat 
      expansion concurs with de novo methylation of the CSTB gene promoter in a similar 
      fashion to other repeat expansion syndromes. We confirmed previous evidence 
      obtained by HpaII digestion and Southern blot analysis that both the promoter and 
      the repeat regions are unmethylated, in both healthy and affected individuals. 
      Thus, in contrast to certain trinucleotide repeat expansion-associated diseases, 
      such as fragile X syndrome (FRAXA) and myotonic dystrophy, methylation analyses 
      can not be utilized for indirect diagnostic testing.

TI  - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a patient with fragile X syndrome: cytogenetic 
      and molecular features.
PG  - ECR13
AB  - Malignancies in patients with fragile X syndrome are rarely reported. A 
      42-year-old man with fragile X syndrome presented with precursor B-cell acute 
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Cytogenetic analysis showed a stemline 46, 
      XY,t(9;22)(q34;qll) and a sideline 46,XY, t(8;14)(q24;qll), t(9;22)(q34;qll). 
      Molecular analysis of the FMR1 gene showed a neoplastic leukemic clone possessing 
      a full expansion of the CGG repeat, with associated aberrant methylation of the 
      promoter CpG islands. However, analysis during morphologic remission showed that 
      the promoter CpG island was apparently unmethylated in the regenerating normal 
      hematopoietic cells. During subsequent relapses, the FMRI CGG repeat was 
      unstable, with the appearance of multiple leukemic subclones possessing different 
      repeat expansions. Our case suggested that deregulation of the FMR1 gene might 
      have contributed to leukemogenesis in our case.

TI  - Reduced FMR1 mRNA translation efficiency in fragile X patients with premutations.
PG  - 1482-8
AB  - The Fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR1) contains a polymorphic trinucleotide 
      CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the FMR1 messenger. We have 
      characterized three lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated male 
      carriers of a premutation that overexpress FMR1 mRNA and show reduced FMRP level 
      compared to normal cells. The analysis of polysomes/mRNPs distribution of mRNA in 
      the cell lines with a premutation shows that the polysomal association of FMR1 
      mRNA, which is high in normal cells, becomes progressively lower with increasing 
      CGG repeat expansion. In addition, we could detect a very low level of FMR1 mRNA 
      in a lymphoblastoid cell line from a patient with a full mutation. In this case, 
      FMR1 mRNA is not at all associated with polysomes, in agreement with the complete 
      absence of FMRP. The impairment of FMR1 mRNA translation in patients with the 
      Fragile X syndrome with FMR1 premutation is the cause of the lower FMRP levels 
      that leads to the clinical involvement.

TI  - Low frequency of MECP2 mutations in mentally retarded males.
PG  - 487-90
AB  - A high frequency of mutations in the methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene 
      has recently been reported in males with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation. 
      The results of this previous study suggested that the frequency of MECP2 
      mutations in the mentally retarded population was comparable to that of CGG 
      expansions in FMR1. In view of these data, we performed MECP2 mutation analysis 
      in a cohort of 475 mentally retarded males who were negative for FMR1 CGG repeat 
      expansion. Five novel changes, detected in seven patients, were predicted to 
      change the MECP2 coding sequence. Except for one, these changes were not found in 
      a control population. While this result appeared to suggest a high mutation rate, 
      this conclusion was not supported by segregation studies. Indeed, three of the 
      five changes could be traced in unaffected male family members. For another 
      change, segregation analysis in the family was not possible. Only one mutation, a 
      frameshift created by a deletion of two bases, was found to be de novo. This 
      study clearly shows the importance of segregation analysis for low frequency 
      mutations, in order to distinguish them from rare polymorphisms. The true 
      frequency of MECP2 mutations in the mentally retarded has probably been 
      overestimated. Based on our data, the frequency of MECP2 mutations in mentally 
      retarded males is 0.2% (1/475).

TI  - DNA damage and repair in lymphoblastoid cell lines from normal donors and fragile 
      X syndrome patients.
PG  - 128-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because lymphocytes from fragile X patients have been reported as 
      hypersensitive to bleomycin-induced chromatid breaks and because the number of 
      trinucleotide repeats in families with fragile X syndrome has a propensity to 
      expand, we have investigated the possibility that fragile X cells may be 
      hypersensitive to DNA damage and have a lower capacity for DNA repair. METHODS: 
      Lymphocytes from normal and fragile X syndrome donors were immortalized by 
      Epstein-Barr virus transformation. Characteristics of fragile X syndrome 
      including the folate-sensitive fragile site on chromosome Xq27.3, length of CGG 
      repeat expansion, and FMRP expression in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed 
      lymphoblastoid cell lines were analyzed by standard cytogenetic methods, Southern 
      blot, and Western blot, respectively. Analysis of DNA damage and repair induced 
      by hydrogen peroxide, bleomycin, ethyl methanesulfonate, 
      4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide, etoposide, and mitomycin C was carried out by 
      single-cell gel electrophoresis assay (known as comet assay). RESULTS: 
      Lymphoblastoid cell lines from fragile X donors had a folate-sensitive fragile 
      site on chromosome Xq27.3, no or low FMRP expression, and expansion of the CGG 
      repeat. Results of comet assay showed that fragile X cells were not more 
      sensitive to mutagen-induced DNA strand breaks and did not have lower DNA repair 
      capacity in comparison with normal cells. Furthermore, one fragile X cell line 
      showed hyposensitivity to DNA strand breaks induced by hydrogen peroxide, 
      bleomycin, and ethyl methansulfonate. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study do 
      not support the notion that CGG trinucleotide expansion in fragile X syndrome is 
      caused by permanent deficiency in DNA repair.

TI  - Is the 31 CAG repeat allele of the spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) gene locus 
      non-specifically associated with trinucleotide expansion diseases?
PG  - 201-5
AB  - A number of human hereditary neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders are 
      caused by the expansion of trinucleotide repeats within certain genes. The 
      molecular mechanisms that underlie these expansions are not yet known. We have 
      analyzed six trinucleotide repeat-containing loci [spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, 
      SCA3, SCA8), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), Huntington chorea (HD) 
      and fragile X syndrome (FRAXA)] in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients (n = 
      52). As controls, we analyzed two groups of subjects: healthy control subjects (n 
      =133), and a group of patients with non-triplet neuromuscular diseases (n = 68) 
      caused by point mutations, deletions or duplications (spinal muscular atrophy, 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 1A, hereditary neuropathy with liability to 
      pressure palsies, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy). Allele frequency 
      distributions for all tested loci were similar in these three groups with the 
      exception of the SCA1 locus. In DM1 patients, the SCA1 allele with 31 CAG repeats 
      account for 40.4% of all chromosomes tested, which is significantly higher than 
      in two other groups (11.3% in healthy controls and 6.6% in the group of 
      non-triplet diseased patients; P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). This is 
      consistent with our previous findings in HD patients. The absence of this 
      association in non-triplet diseases as well as in healthy controls could indicate 
      a possible role of this SCA1 allele with 31 repeats in triplet diseases. Here we 
      discuss a possible role of the SCA1 region in pathological trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions.

TI  - Instability of a (CGG)98 repeat in the Fmr1 promoter.
PG  - 1693-9
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is one of 14 trinucleotide repeat diseases. It arises due to 
      expansion of a CGG repeat which is present in the 5'-untranslated region of the 
      FMR1 gene, disruption of which leads to mental retardation. The mechanisms 
      involved in trinucleotide repeat expansion are poorly understood and to date, 
      transgenic mouse models containing transgenic expanded CGG repeats have failed to 
      reproduce the instability seen in humans. As both cis-acting factors and the 
      genomic context of the CGG repeat are thought to play a role in expansion, we 
      have now generated a knock-in mouse Fmr1 gene in which the murine (CGG)8 repeat 
      has been exchanged with a human (CGG)98 repeat. Unlike other CGG transgenic 
      models, this model shows moderate CGG repeat instability upon both in maternal 
      and paternal transmission. This model will now enable us to study the timing and 
      the mechanism of repeat expansion in mice.

TI  - Molecular screening for fragile X syndrome in mentally handicapped children in 
      Korea.
PG  - 271-5
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is one of the most common forms of inherited mental 
      retardation and is caused by the expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeats in 
      the FMR-1 gene. This study was aimed to facilitate the molecular screening of 
      fragile X syndrome in Korean children with mental retardation of unknown 
      etiology. The subjects were tested by Expand Long Template PCR system in the 
      presence of 7-deaza-dGTP, and then by Southern blot analysis. The PCR method 
      provided rapid and reliable results for the identification of fragile X negative 
      and positive patients. One hundred one mentally retarded children (78 males and 
      23 females) were screened by PCR amplification, which detected only one abnormal 
      sample. The PCR-positive case was confirmed by the CGG repeat expansion on 
      Southern blot analysis with a positive cytogenetic result. In conclusion, Expand 
      Long Template PCR may be used as the first screening test for detecting the 
      fragile X syndrome.

TI  - Implications of the FMR1 gene in menopause: study of 147 Spanish women.
PG  - 106-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between the FMR1 premutation and 
      premature ovarian failure (POF) in the Spanish population and the possible 
      incorporation of this test in gynecological procedures for women with POF or 
      early menopause (EM). DESIGN: Clinical and molecular genetic study. Ninety-eight 
      premutated and six full-mutated carriers of fragile X syndrome and 43 women with 
      POF were studied by polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis for the 
      CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene. RESULTS: Among premutated carriers, 12.2% 
      (12 of 98) presented with POF, and 15.3% (15 of 98) presented with EM. Neither 
      POF nor EM was observed in any of the six full-mutated women. Two women of 43 
      from the POF population (4.65%) were carriers for the CGG premutation in the FMR1 
      gene. No correlation between CGG expansion size and age at menopause was found. A 
      biased paternal origin of the premutation and a high twinning incidence was found 
      in all premutated women, whether they had POF or not. CONCLUSIONS: Our data 
      support the hypothesis that the FMR1 gene is one of the genes associated with POF 
      and EM. Analysis of the CGG expansion in the FMR1 gene may be justified in women 
      with POF and EM until the real role of the FMR1 premutation is determined.

TI  - Novel polymorphism in the FMR1 gene resulting in a "pseudodeletion" of FMR1 in a 
      commonly used fragile X assay.
PG  - 128-31
AB  - The fragile X syndrome is the most commonly inherited cause of mental 
      retardation. Genetic diagnosis of this disease relies on the detection of triplet 
      repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. Although the majority of 
      disease in fragile X patients is due to mutations involving triplet repeat 
      expansion, deletion of various portions of FMR1 has also been described in 
      association with the fragile X syndrome. Here we describe a rare polymorphism in 
      the noncoding region of FMR1 that mimics detection of a deletion in a commonly 
      used assay for fragile X syndrome, which can result in misdiagnosis of the 
      disease.

TI  - Increase of FMRP expression, raised levels of FMR1 mRNA, and clonal selection in 
      proliferating cells with unmethylated fragile X repeat expansions: a clue to the 
      sex bias in the transmission of full mutations?
PG  - 842-50
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is a triplet repeat disorder caused by expansions of a CGG 
      repeat in the fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR1) to more than 220 triplets 
      (full mutation) that usually coincide with hypermethylation and transcriptional 
      silencing. The disease phenotype results from deficiency or loss of FMR1 protein 
      (FMRP) and occurs in both sexes. The underlying full mutations arise exclusively 
      on transmission from a mother who carries a premutation allele (60-200 CGGs). 
      While the absolute requirement of female transmission could result from different 
      mechanisms, current evidence favours selection or contraction processes acting at 
      gametogenesis of pre- and full mutation males. To address these questions 
      experimentally, we used a model system of cultured fibroblasts from a male who 
      presented heterogeneous unmethylated expansions in the pre- and full mutation 
      size range. On continual cell proliferation to 30 doublings we re-examined the 
      behaviour of the expanded repeats on Southern blots and also determined the 
      expression of the FMR1 gene by FMRP immunocytochemistry, western analysis, and 
      RT-PCR. With increasing population doublings, expansion patterns changed and 
      showed accumulation of shorter alleles. The FMRP levels were below normal but 
      increased continuously while the cells that were immunoreactive for FMRP 
      accumulated. The level of FMR1 mRNA was raised with even higher levels of mRNA 
      measured at higher passages. Current results support the theory of a selection 
      advantage of FMRP positive over FMRP deficient cells. During extensive 
      proliferation of spermatogonia in fragile X males, this selection mechanism would 
      eventually replace all full mutations by shorter alleles allowing more efficient 
      FMRP translation. At the proliferation of oogonia of carrier females, the same 
      mechanism would, in theory, favour transmission of any expanded FMR1 allele on 
      inactive X chromosomes.

TI  - Identification of small FRAXA premutations.
PG  - 221-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of fragile X syndrome in mentally retarded individuals is 
      satisfactorily achieved using a Southern blot test that detects the typical 
      triplet repeat expansion (>200 repeats) within the FMR1 gene. All such 
      individuals inherit the mutation from a carrier, who usually shows a lower 
      triplet repeat number and may be asymptomatic. Having identified a fragile X 
      proband, it is necessary to identify related carriers of this familial X-linked 
      dominant mutation to provide family counseling and testing. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      For one family in which a fragile XA repeat expansion occurs, Southern blot 
      hybridization did not give accurate sizing data because of the very small 
      premutation associated with the unstable allele. PCR sizing methods and linkage 
      analysis were adapted to identify family members with the premutation. 
      CONCLUSION: Although most carriers can be detected using Southern blot and/or 
      direct PCR sizing tests, very small expansions (55-70 repeats) are difficult to 
      distinguish from larger, normal alleles. We have used linkage analysis in 
      combination with direct allele analysis to identify carriers of very small 
      expansions of a fragile X chromosome in a four-generation family.

TI  - Fragile X males with unmethylated, full mutation trinucleotide repeat expansions 
      have elevated levels of FMR1 messenger RNA.
PG  - 232-6
AB  - Fragile X syndrome normally arises as a consequence of large expansions (n >200) 
      of a (CGG)(n) trinucleotide repeat in the promoter region of the FMR1 gene. The 
      clinical phenotype is thought to result from hypermethylation of the repeat and 
      adjacent upstream elements, with consequent down-regulation of transcription 
      (transcriptional silencing). However, the relationship between repeat expansion 
      and transcription has not been defined in the full mutation range. Using the 
      method of quantitative (fluorescence) reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 
      reaction, we demonstrated previously that FMR1 mRNA levels are substantially 
      elevated in premutation (55 </= n < 200) male carriers. In the current work, we 
      report that in fragile X males with unmethylated alleles in the full mutation 
      range (n > 200), FMR1 mRNA levels remain significantly elevated (mean 3.5-fold 
      elevation; P = 6.7 x 10(-3)) relative to normal controls, even for alleles 
      exceeding 300 repeats. This conclusion is independent of any assumption regarding 
      the transcriptional activity of methylated alleles. However, if it were assumed 
      that all methylated alleles were transcriptionally silent, the FMR1 mRNA levels 
      for cells with unmethylated alleles would be even higher (mean 4.5-fold 
      elevation; P = 2.1 x 10(-4)). These observations show that the full-mutation CGG 
      expansion per se is not a strong impediment to transcription and that the 
      apparent up-regulation of the FMR1 locus remains active in at least some cells 
      with full-mutation alleles.

PG  - 258-60
AB  - Fragile-X syndrome, a frequent cause of inherited mental retardation, is 
      characterised in almost all cases by a CGG-repeat expansion that is located 
      within the FMR-1 gene and that prevents the expression of fragile-X mental 
      retardation protein (FMRP). We describe a test that simultaneously allows the 
      rapid detection of FMRP in fetal lymphocytes and distinguishes these from fetal 
      erythrocytes. Routine molecular genetic methods fail in the rare cases where 
      protein expression is blocked, although there is no repeat expansion. 
      Furthermore, they are unsuitable in cases of advanced pregnancy. Our test proves 
      extremely valuable under both these circumstances.

PG  - 262-4
AB  - Co-occurrent autoimmune disease and fragile X syndrome has been reported in the 
      literature and we have therefore studied the expansion of 
      Cytosine-Guanine-Guanine (CGG) repeat in FMR1 gene in a series of females with 
      autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome, 
      with PCR and Southern blot methods. The average length of trinucleotide repeat 
      was not increased in these female patients as compared with controls. These 
      preliminary data on a short series of patients suggest a possible absence of 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion abnormality associated with autoimmune diseases 
      such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome.

TI  - Fragile X CGG repeat structures among African-Americans: identification of a 
      novel factor responsible for repeat instability.
PG  - 1759-69
AB  - The cryptic CGG repeat responsible for the fragile X syndrome, located in the 
      5'-UTR of FMR1, is unique compared with the many other triplet repeat-causing 
      diseases, making it ideal for identifying factors involved in repeat expansion 
      that may be common to other triplet repeat diseases. To date, a number of factors 
      have been identified which may influence repeat instability, including the number 
      and position of interspersed AGGs, length of the 3' pure CGG repeat and haplotype 
      background. However, nearly all such data were derived from studies of 
      Caucasians. Using a large African-American population, we present the only 
      comprehensive examination of factors associated with CGG repeat instability in a 
      non-Caucasian population. Among Caucasians, susceptible alleles were thought to 
      come from those in the intermediate repeat range (41-60 repeats); however, we 
      find that susceptible alleles may come from a larger repeat pool (35-60 repeats) 
      and are better defined by their pure CGG repeat and/or -presence of only one AGG 
      interruption. These results demonstrate the existence of different susceptible 
      alleles among world populations and may account for the similar prevalence of the 
      fragile X syndrome in African-Americans compared with Caucasians despite the 
      lower frequency of inter-mediate sized alleles in the African-American 
      population. Finally, we show that repeat structures among unaffected 
      African-Americans with the most frequent fragile X haplotype background are 
      either pure or contain a single distal interruption. We propose that the lack of 
      a proximal most interruption is a novel factor involved in CGG repeat 
      instability.

TI  - Characterization of trinucleotide- and tandem repeat-containing transcripts 
      obtained from human spinal cord cDNA library by high-density filter 
      hybridization.
PG  - 265-73
AB  - In order to identify trinucleotide- and tandem repeat-containing transcripts in 
      human spinal cord, hybridization of a high-density spinal cord cDNA library 
      filter was carried out using a radioactively labeled degenerate oligonucleotide 
      designed to detect different trinucleotide repeats including those known to occur 
      in disease-associated expansions, in a single step. The sequence analysis of the 
      trinucleotide repeat-containing transcripts (TNRTs) revealed 23 known mammalian 
      genes with trinucleotide repeat-containing regions (TNRs), some of which were not 
      previously reported to contain TNRs, and 18 cDNA clones with no or insignificant 
      sequence homology to known genes. Amongst the known genes detected was the 
      fragile X gene (FMR-1) containing (CGG)30. Other genes containing extended TNRs 
      of 9 to 21 repeats were calcium-dependent protease, ATBF1-A, ferritin H chain, 
      and the G protein Gsalpha2. Ten sequences containing perfect TNRs and two 
      sequences containing perfect tandem repeats (derived from 11 TNRTs) were further 
      analyzed for allelic variation using primers flanking the TNR, and five were 
      shown to exhibit two to five alleles per TNR. These transcripts were further 
      investigated for their chromosomal localization where unknown or only partially 
      characterized. The transcripts that were polymorphic in the TNR region were 
      ATBF1-A (a homeodomain protein), clone 390013 on chromosome Xp11, a member of the 
      family of the 14.3.3 protein kinase C regulators, a human translation initiation 
      factor (an isolog of the yeast Suilisol gene 1), and a novel sequence (TR21). 
      Only the first two transcripts showed the presence of rare expanded alleles. 
      Characterization of polymorphic TNRs in novel and even known genes expressed in 
      human spinal cord is likely to help in the identification of new candidates for 
      genes involved in neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - FRAXE mutation in a mentally retarded subject and in his phenotypically normal 
      twin brother.
PG  - 157-62
AB  - The FRAXE fragile site, 600 kb distal to the more common FRAXA, has been reported 
      to be expressed in subjects with mild non-syndromal mental retardation (MR). 
      Amplification of more than 200 GCC repeats, associated with methylation of the 
      adjacent CpG island at Xq28, leads to the expression of the fragile site. In 1996 
      a large gene, FMR2, transcribed distally from the CpG island and downregulated by 
      repeat expansion and methylation, was identified. Among 232 mentally retarded 
      patients, tested FRAXA negative, we identified an Italian family segregating a 
      hypermethylated expansion at the FRAXE locus in two dizygotic twin brothers, 
      their sister and their mother. The index case was referred at 23 years of age 
      with severe MR, epilepsy, a dysmorphic face with a high arched palate, marfanoid 
      habitus and hyperreflexia of the lower limbs. His brother was referred to as 
      normal and psychometric tests confirmed he is not mentally retarded. All members 
      of the family underwent FRAXE molecular analysis, after cytogenetic expression of 
      the fraX site and negative FRAXA test. Interestingly, an expansion and a 
      hypermethylation at the FRAXE locus were found in all of them. Fibroblasts from 
      the clinically normal brother were assayed for FMR2 expression and the 
      transcription of the gene was found to be silenced. The presence of a 
      phenotypically normal male with absent FMR2 expression in fibroblasts suggests 
      that the relationship between the FRAXE mutation, FMR2 expression and MR needs to 
      be further investigated.

TI  - Interruption of the fragile X syndrome expanded sequence d(CGG)(n) by 
      interspersed d(AGG) trinucleotides diminishes the formation and stability of 
      d(CGG)(n) tetrahelical structures.
PG  - 1535-41
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is caused by expansion of a d(CGG) trinucleotide repeat 
      sequence in the 5' untranslated region of the first exon of the FMR1 gene. Repeat 
      expansion is thought to be instigated by formation of d(CGG)(n)secondary 
      structures. Stable FMR1 d(CGG)(n)runs in normal individuals consist of 6-52 
      d(CGG) repeats that are interrupted every 9-11 triplets by a single d(AGG) 
      trinucleotide. By contrast, individuals having fragile X syndrome premutation or 
      full mutation present >54-200 or >200-2000 monotonous d(CGG) repeats, 
      respectively. Here we show that the presence of interspersed d(AGG) triplets 
      diminished in vitro formation of bimolecular tetrahelical structures of 
      d(CGG)(18)oligomers. Tetraplex structures formed by d(CGG)(n)oligomers containing 
      d(AGG) interspersions had lower thermal stability. In addition, tetraplex 
      structures of d(CGG)(18)oligomers interspersed by d(AGG) triplets were unwound by 
      human Werner syndrome DNA helicase at rates and to an extent that exceeded the 
      unwinding of tetraplex form consisting of monotonous d(CGG)(18). Diminished 
      formation and stability of tetraplex structures of d(AGG)-containing FMR1 
      d(CGG)(2-50)tracts might restrict their expansion in normal individuals.

TI  - A survey of fragile X syndrome in a sample from Spanish Basque country.
PG  - 197-201
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. The 
      syndrome is associated with a CGG repeat expansion in the 5'UTR of the first exon 
      of the FMR1 gene. This gene maps to Xq27.3 and coincides with the cytogenetic 
      fragile site (FRAXA). The present study deals with the prevalence of fragile X 
      syndrome among individuals with mental retardation of unknown cause from 
      institutions and special schools from the Spanish Basque Country. Results of 
      cytogenetic and molecular studies, performed in a group of 134 unrelated 
      individuals (92 males and 42 females) are presented. The cytogenetic marker at 
      Xq27.3 was identified in 12 patients. Other chromosomal abnormalities were found 
      in two cases that this and previous studies confirmed as Angelman and 
      Prader-Willi syndromes. Two males, in whom the cytogenetic marker was identified, 
      were found negative for FRAXA and FRAXE expansion at the molecular level. The 
      present study shows that the frequency of the FRAXA full mutation in individuals 
      of Spanish non-Basque origin is in the range of other Spanish populations. In the 
      sample of Spanish Basque origin we have not found cytogenetic FRAXA site 
      expression, and the CGG repeat size of FMR1 gene is in the normal range. The 
      significance of these results are discussed.

TI  - Elevated levels of FMR1 mRNA in carrier males: a new mechanism of involvement in 
      the fragile-X syndrome.
PG  - 6-15
AB  - Fragile-X syndrome is a trinucleotide-repeat-expansion disorder in which the 
      clinical phenotype is believed to result from transcriptional silencing of the 
      fragile-X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene as the number of CGG repeats exceeds 
      approximately 200. For premutation alleles ( approximately 55-200 repeats), no 
      abnormalities in FMR1-gene expression have been described, despite growing 
      evidence of clinical involvement in premutation carriers. To address this 
      (apparent) paradox, we have determined, for 16 carrier males (55-192 repeats), 
      the relative levels of leukocyte FMR1 mRNA, by use of automated 
      fluorescence-detection reverse transcriptase-PCR, and the percent of lymphocytes 
      that are immunoreactive for FMR1 protein (FMRP). For some alleles with>100 
      repeats, there was a reduction in the number of FMRP-positive cells. 
      Unexpectedly, FMR1 mRNA levels were elevated at least fivefold within this same 
      range. No significant increase in FMR1 mRNA stability was observed in a 
      lymphoblastoid cell line (160 repeats) derived from one of the carrier males, 
      suggesting that the increased message levels are due to an increased rate of 
      transcription. Current results support a mechanism of involvement in premutation 
      carriers, in which reduced translational efficiency is at least partially 
      compensated through increased transcriptional activity. Thus, diminished 
      translational efficiency may be important throughout much of the premutation 
      range, with a mechanistic switch occurring in the full-mutation range as the FMR1 
      gene is silenced.

TI  - Isolation of an FMRP-associated messenger ribonucleoprotein particle and 
      identification of nucleolin and the fragile X-related proteins as components of 
      the complex.
PG  - 7925-32
AB  - The loss of FMR1 expression due to trinucleotide repeat expansion leads to 
      fragile X syndrome, a cause of mental retardation. The encoded protein, FMRP, is 
      a member of a gene family that also contains the fragile X-related proteins, 
      FXR1P and FXR2P. FMRP has been shown to be a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein 
      that selectively binds a subset of mRNAs, forms messenger ribonucleoprotein 
      (mRNP) complexes, and associates with translating ribosomes. Here we describe a 
      cell culture system from which we can isolate epitope-tagged FMRP along with 
      mRNA, including its own message, and at least six other proteins. We identify two 
      of these proteins as FXR1P and FXR2P by using specific antisera and identify a 
      third protein as nucleolin by using mass spectrometry. The presence of nucleolin 
      is confirmed by both reactivity with a specific antiserum as well as reverse 
      coimmunoprecipitation where antinucleolin antiserum immunoprecipitates endogenous 
      FMRP from both cultured cells and mouse brain. The identification of nucleolin, a 
      known component of other mRNPs, adds a new dimension to the analysis of FMRP 
      function, and the approach described should also allow the identification of the 
      remaining unknown proteins of this FMRP-associated mRNP as well as the other 
      bound mRNAs.

TI  - Hypomethylation of an expanded FMR1 allele is not associated with a global DNA 
      methylation defect.
PG  - 1375-86
AB  - The vast majority of fragile-X full mutations are heavily methylated throughout 
      the expanded CGG repeat and the surrounding CpG island. Hypermethylation 
      initiates and/or stabilizes transcriptional inactivation of the FMR1 gene, which 
      causes the fragile X-syndrome phenotype characterized, primarily, by mental 
      retardation. The relation between repeat expansion and hypermethylation is not 
      well understood nor is it absolute, as demonstrated by the identification of 
      nonretarded males who carry hypomethylated full mutations. To better characterize 
      the methylation pattern in a patient who carries a hypomethylated full mutation 
      of approximately 60-700 repeats, we have evaluated methylation with the McrBC 
      endonuclease, which allows analysis of numerous sites in the FMR1 CpG island, 
      including those located within the CGG repeat. We report that the expanded-repeat 
      region is completely free of methylation in this full-mutation male. 
      Significantly, this lack of methylation appears to be specific to the expanded 
      FMR1 CGG-repeat region, because various linked and unlinked repetitive-element 
      loci are methylated normally. This finding demonstrates that the lack of 
      methylation in the expanded CGG-repeat region is not associated with a global 
      defect in methylation of highly repeated DNA sequences. We also report that de 
      novo methylation of the expanded CGG-repeat region does not occur when it is 
      moved via microcell-mediated chromosome transfer into a de novo 
      methylation-competent mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line.

TI  - A methylation PCR approach for detection of fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 71-9
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is associated with the expansion of the number of CGG 
      trinucleotide tandem repeats at the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. The 
      number of CGG trinucleotide repeats in normal individuals ranges between 5 and 
      50, in asymptomatic carrier individuals it ranges between 50 and 200, and in 
      affected individuals it is more than 200 CGG repeats. In addition, in affected 
      individuals the cytosine residues in the CGG repeats and the adjacent CpG island 
      are methylated and the FMR1 gene is transcriptionally inactive. The most common 
      diagnostic method for the detection of the syndrome is Southern blot analysis. 
      Methods based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) could facilitate the rapid 
      screening of large numbers of individuals by accurately determining the number of 
      CGG repeats. Current PCR techniques for amplification of CGG repeats are, 
      however, inefficient and unreliable because of their 100% C+G composition. Thus, 
      most of the described PCR protocols require subsequent Southern blot analysis and 
      autoradiography. We present a novel PCR approach for the diagnosis of fragile X 
      syndrome based on the methylation-sensitive conversion of C residues to U by 
      bisulfite on single-strand DNA and subsequent amplification of the antisense 
      strand with specific primers. A PCR with primers for methylated C residues will 
      amplify the CpG dinucleotide region upstream to CGG repeats exclusively in 
      affected males. As a result of extensive mismatch between primers and 
      bisulfite-treated DNA, no PCR fragments will be obtained in normal and 
      transmitting males. Moreover, the bisulfite treatment dramatically reduces the 
      C+G component of the region; thus, the high Tm and the strong secondary 
      structures are no longer obstacles for PCR amplification. In normal and carrier 
      individuals, UUG repeats (previously 3'-CCG-5') in the antisense strand can 
      easily be amplified and visualized on a gel by ethidium bromide staining. We 
      applied our method on 25 males previously diagnosed by Southern blot analysis. 
      All the samples were easily and accurately diagnosed. The method has considerable 
      advantages compared with other diagnostic tests for fragile X syndrome.

TI  - Application of capillary nongel sieving electrophoresis for gene analysis.
PG  - 1822-8
AB  - Capillary electrophoresis (CE) has proved to be a strong tool for DNA analysis 
      and has found abundant applications in the fields of restriction fragment sizing, 
      mutation screening, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product characterizing and 
      forensic identifying. CE may be the main alternative to slab gel electrophoresis. 
      Capillary nongel electrophoresis is the most favorable mode when aiming for this 
      purpose because of its advantages of long lifetime, easy operation, good 
      reproducibility, and low expense. In this paper, a new kind of sieving matrix, 
      with mannitol as the additive for capillary electrophoresis, as well as related 
      methods and their application for gene analysis were reported. Nine DNA fragments 
      amplified by multiplex PCR from a normal dystrophin gene were well separated by 
      this system. Three different deletions were found in Duchenne muscular dystrophy 
      (DMD) patients. Three to four copies of the sex-determination region of the Y 
      chromosome (SRY) gene, as well as the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, could 
      be detected in mixed samples. The frequencies of short tandem repeats (STR) in 
      PAH genes was analyzed in 61 normal Chinese individuals and 6 phenylketonuria 
      families. One case of prenatal gene diagnosis was performed. By using this 
      matrix, CE coupled with reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), the analysis of the 
      alternative splicing expression pattern of the fragile X mental retardation 1 
      (FMR1) gene in adult lung tissue was achieved.

TI  - Fragile X syndrome with FMR1 and FMR2 deletion.
PG  - 565-6
AB  - We report a 13 year old boy with fragile X syndrome resulting from a de novo 
      deletion of the FMR1 and FMR2 genes extending from (and including) DXS7536 
      proximally to FMR2 distally. The patient has severe developmental delay, 
      epilepsy, and behavioural difficulties, including autistic features. He has 
      epicanthic folds, in addition to facial features typical of fragile X syndrome, 
      and marked joint hypermobility. We compare our patient to the three other cases 
      reported in which both FMR1 and FMR2 are deleted. This case has the smallest 
      deletion reported to date. All four patients have epilepsy and a more severe 
      degree of mental retardation than is usual in fragile X syndrome resulting from 
      FMR1 triplet repeat expansion. Three of the patients have joint laxity and two 
      have epicanthic folds. We suggest that these features, in particular severe 
      developmental delay and epilepsy, may form part of the characteristic phenotype 
      resulting from deletion of both FMR1 and FMR2 genes. The diagnosis in this case 
      was delayed because routine cytogenetics showed no abnormality and standard 
      molecular tests for FMR1 triplet repeat expansion (PCR and Southern blotting) 
      failed. Further DNA studies should be undertaken to investigate for a deletion 
      where clinical suspicion of fragile X syndrome is strong and routine laboratory 
      tests fail.

TI  - Stability of the human fragile X (CGG)(n) triplet repeat array in Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae deficient in aspects of DNA metabolism.
PG  - 5675-84
AB  - Expanded trinucleotide repeats underlie a growing number of human diseases. The 
      human FMR1 (CGG)(n) array can exhibit genetic instability characterized by 
      progressive expansion over several generations leading to gene silencing and the 
      development of the fragile X syndrome. While expansion is dependent upon the 
      length of uninterrupted (CGG)(n), instability occurs in a limited germ line and 
      early developmental window, suggesting that lineage-specific expression of other 
      factors determines the cellular environment permissive for expansion. To identify 
      these factors, we have established normal- and premutation-length human FMR1 
      (CGG)(n) arrays in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and assessed the frequency 
      of length changes greater than 5 triplets in cells deficient in various DNA 
      repair and replication functions. In contrast to previous studies with 
      Escherichia coli, we observed a low frequency of orientation-dependent large 
      expansions in arrays carrying long uninterrupted (CGG)(n) arrays in a wild-type 
      background. This frequency was unaffected by deletion of several DNA mismatch 
      repair genes or deletion of the EXO1 and DIN7 genes and was not enhanced through 
      meiosis in a wild-type background. Array contraction occurred in an 
      orientation-dependent manner in most mutant backgrounds, but loss of the Sgs1p 
      resulted in a generalized increase in array stability in both orientations. In 
      contrast, FMR1 arrays had a 10-fold-elevated frequency of expansion in a rad27 
      background, providing evidence for a role in lagging-strand Okazaki fragment 
      processing in (CGG)(n) triplet repeat expansion.

PG  - 245-9
AB  - Large expansions of the CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene 
      are found in patients with the fragile X syndrome. Amplified CGG repeats in FMR1 
      are unstable and show intergenerational increase from mother to offspring. The 
      exact timing of repeat amplification, however, is unknown. We have compared the 
      extent of CGG expansion in various tissues of this deceased fragile X patient, 
      and found only limited variation in repeat expansion. The repeat was fully 
      methylated in all tissues examined. Therefore, no evidence for extensive mitotic 
      expansion of the CGG repeat during fetal or postnatal life of a fragile X patient 
      was found, in contrast to dynamic mutations caused by CAG/CTG repeat expansion. 
      Extensive pathological examination of this patient and his affected brother 
      revealed no evidence for specific abnormalities relevant to fragile X syndrome; 
      cerebellar hypoplasia, which has been reported in this disorder, was not evident 
      in either patient.

TI  - Strong similarities of the FMR1 mutation in multiple tissues: postmortem studies 
      of a male with a full mutation and a male carrier of a premutation.
PG  - 240-4
AB  - Studies of the FMR1 mutation in multiple tissues are important to further our 
      understanding of CGG repeat expansion in development and of the frequency and 
      possible clinical significance of inter-tissue heterogeneity in fragile X 
      syndrome. With some exceptions, most cases reported have shown strong similarity 
      of the mutation size and methylation status between tissues. However, there have 
      been only a few studies of multiple tissues including regions of the brain. We 
      report on two postmortem studies of multiple tissues, one of a male with a full 
      mutation (fully methylated) and one of a male carrier of a premutation. The male 
      with the full mutation (TH) had a typical presentation of fragile X syndrome, 
      including mild mental retardation. He had a methylated full mutation of two 
      predominant sizes in all 12 tissues analyzed, including three regions of the 
      brain. The male carrier of a premutation (GC) was clinically unaffected, and the 
      mutation was the same size in all 14 tissues examined including seven regions of 
      the brain. Therefore, both cases demonstrated lack of inter-tissue heterogeneity, 
      suggesting strong somatic stability after the period of expansion to the observed 
      mutation size(s). Also, both cases showed consistency between clinical phenotype 
      and mutation characteristics in the brain.

TI  - FMR1 gene expression in olfactory neuroblasts from two males with fragile X 
      syndrome.
PG  - 25-30
AB  - The fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) mutation is strongly correlated 
      with specific and marked neurobehavioral and neuroanatomical abnormalities. The 
      protein product, FMRP, is highly expressed in neurons of the normal mammalian 
      brain, and absent or in low levels in leukocytes from individuals with fragile X 
      (FraX)-associated mental impairment. Inferences which arise from these findings 
      are that FMRP has a critical role in the development and functioning of the 
      brain, and that leukocyte-derived molecular assessments provide a good indicator 
      of FMR1 expression in that organ. This latter conclusion appears true in most 
      cases even though the typical FMR1 mutation is an unstable triplet repeat 
      expansion which demonstrates somatic heterogeneity within and across tissues. 
      Blood to brain correspondence in FraX patients has only rarely been confirmed by 
      the direct study of human brain specimens and, to our knowledge, it has never 
      been studied in living individuals with the FMR1 mutation. In this report, we 
      describe the FMR1 patterns in olfactory neuroblasts (ON) from two living brothers 
      with expansion mutations in their leukocytes who are mentally retarded and 
      autistic. ON were chosen for study because they are accessible neurons closely 
      linked to the brain. In both subjects, the ON genotype was highly, but not 
      perfectly, consistent with that observed in leukocytes. Protein phenotypes across 
      tissues were completely consistent showing the absence of FMRP-immunoreactivity 
      (-ir). These results augment the limited amount of direct evidence which 
      indicates that FMR1 mutation patterns in leukocytes are a good, albeit 
      potentially fallible, reflection of such patterns in the brain. This report 
      further demonstrates the feasibility of using ON samples to evaluate the FMR1 
      mutation in humans in vivo.

TI  - Screening with the FMR1 protein test among mentally retarded males.
PG  - 520-2
AB  - The fragile X syndrome is characterized by X-linked mental retardation with 
      additional features such as a long face with large protruding ears, 
      macroorchidism, and eye-gaze avoidance. The disorder is caused by an abnormally 
      expanded CGG repeat within the first exon of the fragile X mental retardation 
      (FMR1) gene that is associated with shutdown of transcription and absence of the 
      fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Detection of patients and carriers 
      of the fragile X syndrome is done by DNA analysis of the CGG repeat, whereas the 
      FMRP antibody test allows rapid detection of male patients using bloodsmears. In 
      a screening program for the fragile X syndrome in the southwest of the 
      Netherlands, 412 males with mental retardation of unknown cause were subjected to 
      the protein test. The patients were scored for fragile X features and their DNA 
      tested for the FMR1 mutation, as reported previously. The FMRP test detected two 
      fragile X patients with a repeat expansion in FMR1, whereas normal protein 
      expression was observed in all the retarded male patients with a normal repeat. 
      The FMRP test was found to be suitable for screening among a large population of 
      retarded males. The results also suggest that mutations other than the CGG repeat 
      leading to absence of detectable FMRP are apparently rare among mentally retarded 
      males.

TI  - Re-examination of factors associated with expansion of CGG repeats using a single 
      nucleotide polymorphism in FMR1.
PG  - 1935-46
AB  - In at least 98% of fragile X syndrome cases, the disease results from expansion 
      of the CGG repeat in the 5' end of FMR1. The use of microsatellite markers in the 
      FMR1 region has revealed a disparity of risk between haplotypes for CGG repeat 
      expansion. Although instability appears to depend on both the haplotype and the 
      AGG interspersion pattern of the repeat, these factors alone do not completely 
      describe the molecular basis for the linkage disequilibrium between normal and 
      fragile X chromosomes, in part due to instability of the marker loci themselves. 
      In an effort to better understand the mechanism of dynamic mutagenesis, we have 
      searched for and discovered a single nucleotide polymorphism in intron 1 of FMR1 
      and characterized this marker, called ATL1, in 564 normal and 152 fragile X 
      chromosomes. The G allele of this marker is found in 40% of normal chromosomes, 
      in contrast to 83% of fragile X chromosomes. Not only is the G allele exclusively 
      linked to haplotypes over-represented in fragile X syndrome, but G allele 
      chromosomes also appear to transition to instability at a higher rate on 
      haplotypes negatively associated with risk of expansion. The two alleles of ATL1 
      also reveal a highly significant linkage disequilibrium between unstable 
      chromosomes and the 5' end of the CGG repeat itself, specifically the position of 
      the first AGG interruption. The data expand the number of haplotypes associated 
      with FMR1 and specifically allow discrimination, by ATL1 alleles, of single 
      haplotypes with differing predispositions to expansion. Such haplotypes should 
      prove useful in further defining the mechanism of dynamic mutagenesis.

TI  - Expanded (CAG)n, (CGG)n and (GAA)n trinucleotide repeat microsatellites, and 
      mutant purine synthesis and pigmentation genes cause schizophrenia and autism.
PG  - 223-33
AB  - Unstable (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat microsatellites are hypothesized to cause 
      schizophrenia. The (CAG)n microsatellite of dominant spinal cerebellar ataxia 
      type 1 (SCA1) is a candidate schizophrenia gene. Autism results from expansions 
      of (CGG)n and (GAA)n trinucleotide repeat stretches at fragile X syndrome 
      (FRAXA), and the recessive Friedreich's ataxia (FA). Dominant ataxia genes may 
      cause schizophrenia and recessive ataxia genes may cause autism. Syndromes with 
      autism show purine synthesis defects (PSDs) and/or pigmentation defects (PDs). 
      Autism is caused by very lengthy expansions of (CAG)n, (CGG)n and (GAA)n repeats, 
      while schizophrenia results from much smaller (CAG)n and (CGG)n repeat 
      expansions.

TI  - Absence of the fragile X CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in girls diagnosed 
      with a pervasive developmental disorder.
PG  - 363-5
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of the fragile X (FRAX) 
      CGG trinucleotide expansion in a population of young girls (n = 45) diagnosed 
      with pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). Their mean age was 43.7 months 
      (range, 25 to 132 months). Diagnoses included autistic disorder (n = 20), PDD (n 
      = 23), and Asperger's syndrome (n = 2). Molecular FRAX testing was performed on 
      all patients by using the Southern gene blot technique. Genomic DNA was digested 
      with both EcoRI and EagI, fractionated on agarose gel, and blotted and probed 
      with the radiolabeled StB12.3 FMR-1 probe. None of the subjects were found to 
      have an expansion of CGG in either the 2.8 kb or 5.2 kb fragments. A 95% CI, for 
      the prevalence of the FRAX mutation in female subjects with PDD, has an upper 
      bound of 2.9%. We conclude that the prevalence of FRAX positivity in girls with 
      PDD is lower than previously reported. This raises the question of whether any 
      association between FRAX and PDD in female subjects is specific to PDD or is 
      related rather to the presence of mental retardation.

TI  - Purified recombinant Fmrp exhibits selective RNA binding as an intrinsic property 
      of the fragile X mental retardation protein.
PG  - 15521-7
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is caused by the transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene 
      due to a trinucleotide repeat expansion. The encoded protein, Fmrp, has been 
      found to be a nucleocytoplasmic RNA-binding protein containing both KH domains 
      and RGG boxes that associates with polyribosomes as a ribonucleoprotein particle. 
      RNA binding has previously been demonstrated with in vitro-translated Fmrp; 
      however, it remained uncertain whether the selective RNA binding observed was an 
      intrinsic property of Fmrp or required an associated protein(s). Here, 
      baculovirus-expressed and affinity-purified FLAG-tagged murine Fmrp was shown to 
      bind directly to both ribonucleotide homopolymers and human brain mRNA. FLAG-Fmrp 
      exhibited selectivity for binding poly(G) > poly(U) >> poly(C) or poly(A). 
      Moreover, purified FLAG-Fmrp bound to only a subset of brain mRNA, including the 
      3' untranslated regions of myelin basic protein message and its own message. 
      Recombinant isoform 4, lacking the RGG boxes but maintaining both KH domains, was 
      also purified and was found to only weakly interact with RNA. FLAG-purified I304N 
      Fmrp, harboring the mutation of severe fragile X syndrome, demonstrated RNA 
      binding, in contrast to previous suggestions. These data demonstrate the 
      intrinsic property of Fmrp to selectively bind RNA and show FLAG-Fmrp as a 
      suitable reagent for structural characterization and identification of cognate 
      RNA ligands.

TI  - DNA diagnosis of FRAXA and FRAXE in Chinese children with neurodevelopmental 
      disorders and fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 179-83
AB  - Fragile X (FraX) syndrome is the most common cause of inherited mental 
      retardation. To see whether FRAXA or FRAXE can account for the etiology of some 
      unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders in children, we screened for 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in a consecutive cohort of 73 Chinese children and 
      their mothers seen in 1995 (group 1) referred for developmental assessment due to 
      developmental delay, language delay, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 
      autistic spectrum disorder, mental retardation and/or learning disability. We 
      also screened DNA samples of all five previously diagnosed 
      cytogenetically-positive FraX boys, their mothers and sisters (group 2). A 
      control group of unrelated teenagers and adults were recruited from the community 
      (group 3). In group 1, 3 families (2 mothers and a mother and her son) were found 
      to carry a small premutation allele at FRAXA (premutation frequency = 2%, 3/153 
      independent X chromosomes), but none had any expansion at FRAXE. In group 2, all 
      5 FraX boys had full mutation at FRAXA and normal repeat length at FRAXE. In 
      group 3, 1 male has a premutation allele out of 18 males and 59 females tested 
      (premutation frequency of control = 0.7%, 1 out of 136 X chromosomes). For FRAXE 
      screening in group 3, 2 females were carriers (1.5%, 2 out of 136 X chromosomes). 
      Thus, FRAXA and FRAXE cannot account for the etiology of neurodevelopmental 
      disorders in our cohort of Chinese children, and the prevalence of FRAXE mutation 
      in normal Chinese population appears to be higher than reported in the 
      Caucasians.

TI  - Clinical description of an adult male with psychosis who showed FMR1 gene 
      methylation mosaicism.
PG  - 222-4
AB  - Unstable trinucleotide repeat DNA contained in numerous genes has been proposed 
      as the underlying mechanism in the clinical phenomenon of genetic anticipation in 
      fragile X syndrome and other neurodegenerative diseases. No clear evidence has 
      been found for the role of these abnormal trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion-containing genes in schizophrenia or other psychiatric disorders. This 
      report describes an adult male with psychosis who was later found to have 
      methylation mosaicism of the FMR1 gene. We discuss history, examination, and 
      investigation which led to the diagnosis and treatment response of this patient.

TI  - Triplet repeat polymorphism & fragile X syndrome in the Indian context.
PG  - 29-36
AB  - Mental retardation due to fragile X syndrome is one of the genetic disorders 
      caused by triplet repeat expansion. CGG repeat involved in this disease is known 
      to exhibit polymorphism even among normal individuals. Here we describe the 
      development of suitable probes for detection of polymorphism in CGG repeat at 
      FMR1 locus as well as the diagnosis of fragile X syndrome. Using these methods 
      polymorphism at the FMR1 locus has been examined in 161 individuals. Ninety eight 
      patients with unclassified mental retardation were examined, of whom 7 were found 
      to have the expanded (CGG) allele at the FMR1 locus. The hybridization pattern 
      for two patients has been presented as representative data.

TI  - Hairpin induced slippage and hyper-methylation of the fragile X DNA triplets.
PG  - 745-56
AB  - The fragile X triplet repeats, (GCC)n x (GGC)n are located at the 5' untranslated 
      region of the FMR-1 gene. Inordinate repeat expansion and hyper-methylation of 
      the CpG islands inside the repeat lead to the suppression of the FMR-1 gene and 
      the subsequent onset and progression of the disease. Previously, we have shown 
      that the (GCC)n strand of the fragile X repeat readily forms hairpin structures 
      under physiological conditions (Chen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 
      92:5199-5203, 1995: Mariappan et al., Nucl. Acid Res. 24:784-792, 1996). Here, we 
      show by an in vitro assay that formation of the (GCC)n hairpins leads to slippage 
      during replication. The slippage structure is a three-way junction with two 
      Watson-Crick, (GCC)n x (GGC)n, arms and a third (GCC)n hairpin arm. Formation of 
      such slippage structures during replication may explain the observed length 
      polymorphism of the fragile X repeat. We have also studied the substrate 
      efficiency of these three-way junctions toward the human methyltransferase. the 
      enzyme that methylates the CpG sites in DNA. These methylation studies show that 
      the slippage structures induced by the (GCC)n hairpins are 10-15 times more 
      efficient substrates than either the corresponding Watson-Crick duplexes or the 
      (GCC)n hairpins. We demonstrate by appropriate designs that the exceptional 
      substrate efficiency of the three-way junction slippage structures is due to two 
      factors: (i) the presence of the (GCC)n hairpin in which CpG sites are more 
      accessible for methylation than the CpG sites in the Watson-Crick duplex and (ii) 
      the ability of the (GCC)n hairpin in these three-way junctions to move along the 
      Watson-Crick arms that facilitates conversion of low-affinity Watson-Crick CpG 
      sites into high-affinity hairpin CpG sites. Therefore, we suggest that the 
      formation of the (GCC)n hairpins during replication can explain both length 
      polymorphism and hyper-methylation of the fragile X repeats.

TI  - Unusual mutations in high functioning fragile X males: apparent instability of 
      expanded unmethylated CGG repeats.
PG  - 103-11
AB  - We report on further cases of high functioning fragile X males showing decreased 
      expression of FMR1 protein, absence of detectable methylation at the EagI site in 
      the FMR1 gene promoter, and highly unusual patterns of fragile X mutations 
      defined as smear of expansions extending from premutation to full mutation range. 
      Very diffuse and therefore not easily detectable patterns of full mutations were 
      also observed on prenatal testing using DNA from chorionic villi sampled at a 
      time of development when full mutations were still unmethylated in this 
      particular tissue. In the search for possible determinants of such unusual 
      patterns, repeat expansions in the premutation and in the lower full mutation 
      range were identified on genomic PstI blots previously prepared for fragile X DNA 
      testing. Cases with 130 or more triplets, and a number of shorter repeats, were 
      reinvestigated on EcoRI plus EagI digests. Among the 119 expansions, there were 
      22 in our sample showing either blurred bands or smears on PstI blots. This 
      particular characteristic was strongly associated with the coincidence of a 
      repeat size of more than 130 triplets and absence of EagI site methylation. Our 
      data set also includes cases of mosaic patterns consisting of smears of 
      unmethylated expansions to more than 130 CGGs and of clear bands of methylated 
      expansions. We therefore suggest that in fragile X syndrome unusual smeared 
      patterns of mutations result from somatic instability of larger repeats under 
      circumstantial absence of repeat methylation.

TI  - Instability of the FMR2 trinucleotide repeat region associated with expanded FMR1 
      alleles.
PG  - 447-55
AB  - The fragile sites FRAXA and FRAXE, located approximately 600 kb apart on Xq27.3 
      and Xq28, respectively, are due to a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion. Although 
      the expansion mechanism for these and other trinucleotide repeat disorders 
      remains unknown, the similarities between the FRAXA and FRAXE regions suggest a 
      possible association between the 2 sites. DNA from 953 individuals was analyzed 
      to determine the distribution of FRAXE repeat sizes in this population and to 
      ascertain potential association between FRAXA and FRAXE repeat sizes. Thirty-four 
      FMR2 alleles ranging from 3-42 repeats were identified. No FRAXE expansions were 
      found in this population, supporting previous findings that FRAXE expansions are 
      rare. However, in the fragile X syndrome affected group, a FMR2 delection, 2 
      cases of FRAXE repeat instability and a FRAXE mosaic male were identified. Also, 
      a previously identified, rare FMR2 polymorphism was observed. Statistical 
      analysis showed no correlation between normal FRAXA and FRAXE repeat sizes 
      studied, although there was a significant size difference in larger FMR2 alleles 
      that segregated with expanded FMR1 alleles. These findings support the idea of an 
      association between repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene and instability or 
      deletions in the FMR2 gene.

TI  - Fragile X premutations are not a major cause of early menopause.
PG  - 1362-9
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked mental retardation condition that usually is 
      due to a trinucleotide-repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene. Whereas full-mutation 
      alleles (> 230 repeats) lead to fragile X syndrome, premutation alleles 
      (approximately 60-200 repeats) are apparently non-penetrant. However, previous 
      studies have suggested that female premutation carriers may have an increased 
      incidence of premature menopause. To test this possible association, we screened 
      for premutation alleles among 216 women with early menopause (at age < 47 years), 
      33 of whom had premature menopause (at age < 40 years), as well as among 107 
      control women, all of whom were ascertained solely on the basis of age at 
      menopause. No full-mutation alleles were found; and only one premutation allele 
      was found, but, it was in a member of the control group. These results are 
      consistent with what would be expected on the basis of chance only. Our sample 
      size was sufficient to rule out a > or = 3-fold increased risk of early menopause 
      and a > or = 9-fold increased risk of premature menopause due to an FMR1 
      premutation, under a model considering the risk of both sporadic and familial 
      early menopause. Likewise, our results rule out a > or = 4-fold increased risk of 
      familial early menopause and a > or = 26-fold increased risk of familial 
      premature menopause, under a less probable model in which only familial early 
      menopause is considered. These results indicate that the fragile X premutation is 
      not a major risk factor for early menopause and suggest that the risk of 
      premature menopause to fragile X-premutation carriers may not be as great as that 
      reported elsewhere.

      autism and related disorders. Three of the multiplex families exhibited fragile 
      X, and the affected offspring all exhibited CGG triplet repeat insertion 
      mutations in the FMR-1 gene. One of these families contained an affected pair of 
      monozygotic female twins. Both had similar-sized CGG triplet repeat expansions, 
      but different phenotypic manifestations. One suffered from autism and the other 
      from mild mental retardation and marked social anxiety. PCR and Southern 
      hybridization analysis of the CGG repeat sequences characterizing fragile X A 
      (Frax A) and E and the methylation status of FMR-1 showed no evidence of abnormal 
      CGG repeat expansion or FMR-1 hypermethylation in the remaining 22 multiplex 
      families. Moreover, there was no correlation between the Frax A or E (CGG)n 
      repeat length with affected status, nor any association with the low-level (< 3 
      %) expression of cytogenetic fragility at Xq27 previously reported in these 
      families. Our findings indicate that most instances of recurrence in families 
      multiplex for autism and related disorders are not accounted for by Frax A and E. 
      They also indicate that the phenotypic manifestations of Frax A may be influenced 
      by stochastic, environmental and other biological factors.

TI  - Screening for FMR1 and FMR2 mutations in 222 individuals from Spanish special 
      schools: identification of a case of FRAXE-associated mental retardation.
PG  - 503-7
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of familial mental 
      retardation. It results from a (CGG)n trinucleotide expansion in the FMR1 gene 
      leading to the typical Martin-Bell phenotype. Clinical features vary depending on 
      age and sex. Expansion of a (CCG)n repeat in the FMR2 gene corresponds to the 
      FRAXE fragile site which lies distal to FRAXA and is also associated with mental 
      retardation, but it is less frequent and lacks a consistent phenotype. Analysis 
      of repeat expansions in these two genes allows the molecular diagnosis of these 
      different entities. We report here the screening of the FRAXA and FRAXE mutations 
      in 222 unrelated mentally retarded individuals attending Spanish special schools. 
      PCR and/or Southern blotting methods were used. We detected full mutations in the 
      FMR1 gene in 11 boys (4.9%) and 1 boy (0.5%) with a CCG repeat expansion in the 
      FMR2 gene. The latter shows mild mental retardation with psychotic behaviour and 
      no remarkable physical traits. Molecular studies revealed a mosaicism for 
      methylation in the FMR2 gene. This case supports the observation that expansions 
      greater than 100 repeats can be partially methylated and cause the phenotype.

TI  - Molecular genetic analysis of the FMR-1 gene in a large collection of autistic 
      patients.
PG  - 224-9
AB  - A genetic etiology in autism is now strongly supported by family and twin 
      studies. A 3:1 ratio of affected males to females suggests the involvement of at 
      least one X-linked locus in the disease. Several reports have indicated an 
      association of the fragile X chromosomal anomaly at Xq27.3 (FRAXA) with autism, 
      whereas others have not supported this finding. We have so far collected blood 
      from 105 simplex and 18 multiplex families and have assessed 141 patients by 
      using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), the Autism Diagnostic 
      Observation Scale, and psychometric tests. All four ADI-R algorithm criteria were 
      met by 131 patients (93%), whereas 10 patients (7%) showed a broader phenotype of 
      autism. Southern blot analysis was performed with three different enzymes, and 
      filters were hybridized to an FMR-1-specific probe to detect amplification of the 
      CCG repeat at FRAXA, to the complete FMR-1 cDNA probe, and to additional probes 
      from the neighborhood of the gene. No significant changes were found in 139 
      patients (99%) from 122 families, other than the normal variations in the 
      population. In the case of one multiplex family with three children showing no 
      dysmorphic features of the fragile X syndrome (one male meeting 3 out of 4 
      ADI-algorithm criteria, one normal male with slight learning disability but 
      negative ADI-R testing, and one fully autistic female), the FRAXA 
      full-mutation-specific CCG-repeat expansion in the genotype was not correlated 
      with the autism phenotype. Further analysis revealed a mosaic pattern of 
      methylation at the FMR-1 gene locus in the two sons of the family, indicating at 
      least a partly functional gene. Therefore, we conclude that the association of 
      autism with fragile X at Xq27.3 is non-existent and exclude this location as a 
      candidate gene region for autism.

TI  - Effect of in vitro promoter methylation and CGG repeat expansion on FMR-1 
      expression.
PG  - 2883-7
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is associated with a CGG repeat expansion in the 
      5'-untranslated region of the FMR-1 gene. Within the FMR-1 promoter a CpG island 
      is frequently methylated in fragile X patients. To identify the effect of 
      methylation on FMR-1 expression, we transfected methylated and unmethylated 
      constructs containing the FMR-1 promoter in front of the CAT gene (pFXCAT) into 
      COS-1 cells. No difference between methylated and unmethylated DNA was observed 
      initially, whereas reduced CAT mRNA levels were observed 48 h post-transfection 
      of the methylated construct and increased CAT activity from unmethylated DNA was 
      observed at 72 h. To determine the effect of a CGG repeat expansion on gene 
      expression, we inserted >200 CGG repeats between the SV40 promoter and the CAT 
      gene (pSV2CAT). A 3-fold reduction in CAT activity was observed 24-48 h 
      post-transfection. To study the correlation between CGG repeat expansion and 
      FMR-1 transcription, we inserted 200 CGG trinucleotide repeats into the pFXCAT 
      construct. Only a slight difference in mRNA levels was found between cells 
      transfected with pFX(CGG)200CAT or pFXCAT, but a complete lack of CAT activity 
      was observed with introduction of the repeat. We conclude that a moderate size 
      repeat markedly reduces translation. We propose that the presence of a repeat 
      expansion per se is the major factor influencing FMR-1 function in fragile X 
      syndrome.

      Hospital during 1991-1996, studied by cytogenetic and molecular methods.
PG  - 69-74
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of mental disability, 
      world-wide. Main clinical features are cognitive deficit, speech difficulties, 
      delayed development, autism, and particular physical characteristics. The 
      syndrome can be cytogenetically diagnosed by the expression of chromosome X 
      fragile site at band Xq27.3. At molecular level, the cause of the syndrome is 
      defined as an abnormal expansion of CGG trinucleotide repeats in the 5'UTR of the 
      FMR-1 gene as well as hypermethylation at the proximal CpG island. Study of 
      fragile X syndrome at Songklanagarind Hospital during May 1991-June 1996 was 
      herein reported. A total of 287 blood samples of 260 unrelated families were 
      cytogenetically examined by using lymphocyte culture method with 2-4 different 
      treatments. Frequency of positive fragile X cases was found to be 7 in 260 
      (2.7%). Among relatives of the positive ones, 13 individuals were also positive. 
      Other types of chromosome abnormalities were detected in 13 cases (5%). For 
      molecular study, DNA samples were obtained from 97 cases. Investigation of CGG 
      repeat expansion was performed by PCR method. Abnormal expansion was identified 
      as full mutation (> 200 repeats) and premutation (> 50-200 repeats). The 
      abnormalities were found in 14 individuals of 5 unrelated cases; 6 with full 
      mutation and 8 with premutation. No molecular study on the two cytogenetic 
      positive cases has been performed. In conclusion, a total of 50 individuals with 
      fragile X abnormality has been documented: 18 affected cases and 32 carriers. 
      Investigation of the remaining suspected members in positive families is in 
      progress. The information and experience will lead to prevention of this genetic 
      disease by prenatal diagnosis and elective abortion in Thailand.

TI  - Nuclease sensitivity of permeabilized cells confirms altered chromatin formation 
      at the fragile X locus.
PG  - 435-41
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is caused by the expansion and concomitant methylation of a 
      CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene which results in the 
      transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene, delayed replication of the FMR1 
      locus, and the formation of a folate sensitive fragile site (FRAXA) at Xq27.3. 
      The mechanism by which repeat expansion and methylation causes these changes is 
      unknown. An in vivo system in which cells were permeabilized with 
      lysophosphatidylcholine followed by digestion with MspI endonuclease was utilized 
      to assess the chromatin conformation at the fragile X locus. The FMR1 gene was 
      inaccessible to MspI digestion in fragile X patients, but not in normal or 
      carrier individuals, confirming that altered chromatin conformation results from 
      the repeat expansion and methylation seen in fragile X syndrome.

TI  - Nucleosome assembly on methylated CGG triplet repeats in the fragile X mental 
      retardation gene 1 promoter.
PG  - 24325-8
AB  - Expansion and methylation of CGG repeat sequences is associated with Fragile X 
      syndrome in humans. We have examined the consequences of CGG repeat expansion and 
      methylation for nucleosome assembly and positioning on the Fragile X Mental 
      Retardation gene 1 (FMR1) gene. Short unmethylated CGG repeats are not 
      particularly favored in terms of affinity for the histone octamer or for 
      positioning of the reconstituted nucleosome. However, upon methylation their 
      affinity for the histone octamer increases and a highly positioned nucleosome 
      assembles with the repeat sequences found adjacent to the nucleosomal dyad. 
      Expansion of these CGG repeats abolishes the preferential nucleosome assembly due 
      to methylation. Thus, the expansion and methylation of these triplet repeats can 
      alter the functional organization of chromatin, which may contribute to 
      alterations in the expression of the FMR1 gene and the disease phenotype.

TI  - Mosaicism of a microdeletion of 486 bp involving the CGG repeat of the FMR1 gene 
      due to misalignment of GTT tandem repeats at chi-like elements flanking both 
      breakpoints and a full mutation.
PG  - 409-14
AB  - Although the majority of fragile-X patients demonstrate methylation and a 
      much-expanded CGG repeat region in the 5'-untranslated region of exon 1 of the 
      FMR1 gene, exceptional cases have been reported to be due to deletions. However, 
      fine mapping of the deletion breakpoints is still lacking and so far the 
      underlying mechanism is unknown. We identified a fragile-X patient mosaic for a 
      full mutation and a microdeletion. The microdeletion spans 486 bp, involving 168 
      bp upstream from the CGG repeat region, the entire CGG repeat region, exon 1, and 
      138 bp of the first intron of the FMR1 gene. In contrast to previous reports, the 
      5' breakpoint does not fall into the hotspot region. The proximal breakpoint, 
      5'-GTGGTT/T-3', and the distal breakpoint, 5'-GTTGTT/GG-3', can be characterized 
      as chi-like elements and are flanked by direct tandem repeats. Mosaicism of a 
      full mutation and the microdeletion in the DNA of the patient's leukocytes 
      indicates the mitotic origin of the microdeletion. Since the microdeletion allele 
      is unmethylated, it can be concluded that it is not derived from the methylated 
      full mutation but from an unmethylated premutational allele.

TI  - Molecular-intelligence correlations in young fragile X males with a mild CGG 
      repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene.
PG  - 274-7
AB  - Several mechanisms can explain the occurrence of full-mutation fragile X males 
      with an IQ level above -2 SD below mean, also called "high-functioning fragile X 
      males." Incomplete methylation of the CpG island at the 5' end of the FMR1 gene 
      is one of these mechanisms. The present study describes the physical and behavior 
      phenotypes in 7 fragile X boys with CGG repeat insertions in the FMR1 gene 
      between 600-2,400 base pairs. The degree of methylation at the FMR1-associated 
      CpG island ranges in peripheral blood lymphocytes from 0-95%. Subjects with a low 
      degree of methylation at this site have mild or absent physical characteristics 
      of the fragile X syndrome, while subjects with a high degree of methylation at 
      this site have more severe physical characteristics. In this range of CGG repeat 
      insertion (600-2,400 base pairs), the degree of methylation at the 
      FMR1-associated CpG island is a good predictor of intelligence, while CGG repeat 
      insertion length is not.

TI  - Large domains of apparent delayed replication timing associated with triplet 
      repeat expansion at FRAXA and FRAXE.
PG  - 407-16
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansions have been implicated in the causation of a number 
      of neurodegenerative disorders. In the case of fragile X syndrome, full expansion 
      of the FMR1 repeat element (CGG)n has also been correlated with replication 
      timing delay of the locus and proximal flanking sequences in male lymphoblasts. 
      To define more extensively this altered region of DNA replication, as well as to 
      extend these studies to female cells containing premutant and mutant alleles, 
      study of the replication timing properties of a >2-Mb zone in the FRAXA region 
      (Xq27.3-q28) was undertaken by using a FISH technique. In this assay, relative 
      times of replication of specific loci are inferred from the ratios of singlet and 
      doublet hybridization signals in interphase nuclei. In all individuals with a 
      full expansion of the trinucleotide repeat, a large (1-1.2-Mb) region of delayed 
      timing was observed; the apparent timing of the earlier-replicating allele in 
      female cells in this region was intermediate between normal and affected alleles 
      in males, which is in accordance with expectations of a mixed population of cells 
      resulting from random X inactivation. In addition, expansion of the nearby FRAXE 
      locus also was found to correlate with replication timing delay, although the 
      extent of the altered region was somewhat less. Trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      thus may be acting in the Xq27.3-q28 region to alter long-range chromatin 
      structure that could influence transcription of gene sequences within the 
      affected domain.

      island.
PG  - 109-13
AB  - Five folate-sensitive fragile sites have been identified at the molecular level 
      to date. Each is characterized by an expanded and methylated trinucleotide repeat 
      CGG (CCG). Of the three X chromosome sites, FRAXA, FRAXE and FRAXF, the former 
      two are associated with mental retardation in their expanded forms. FRAXA 
      expansion results in fragile X syndrome due to down regulation of expression of 
      the FMR1 gene, which carries the hypermutable CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated 
      portion of its first exon. Mild mental retardation without consistent physical 
      findings has been found associated with expanded CCG repeats at FRAXE. We have 
      identified a large gene (FMR2) transcribed distally from the CpG island at FRAXE, 
      and down-regulated by repeat expansion and methylation. The gene is novel, 
      expressed in adult brain and placenta, and shows similarity with another human 
      protein, MLLT2, expressed from a gene at chromosome 4q21 involved in 
      translocations found in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells. Identification 
      of this gene will facilitate further studies to determine the role of its product 
      in FRAXE associated mental deficiency.

AB  - Autonomous expansions of trinucleotide repeats with the general structure 
      5'-d(CNG)n-3' are associated with several human genetic diseases. We have 
      characterized nuclear proteins binding to the unstable 5'-d(CGG)n-3' repeat. Its 
      expansion in the human FMR1 gene leads to the fragile X syndrome, one of the most 
      frequent causes of mental retardation in human males. Electrophoretic mobility 
      shift assays using nuclear extracts from several human and other mammalian cell 
      lines and from primary human cells demonstrated specific binding to 
      double-stranded DNA fragments containing only a 5'-d(CGG)17-3' repeat or the 
      repeat and flanking genomic sequences of the human FMR1 gene. Protein binding was 
      inhibited by complete methylation of the trinucleotide repeat. The complex formed 
      with crude nuclear extract apparently did not contain the human transcription 
      factor Sp1 that binds to a characteristic GC-rich sequence. A 20-kDa protein 
      involved in specific binding to the double-stranded 5'-d(CGG)17-3' repeat was 
      purified from HeLa nuclear extracts by DNA affinity chromatography.

TI  - Normal phenotype in two brothers with a full FMR1 mutation.
PG  - 2103-8
AB  - The fragile X syndrome is associated with an expanding CGG repeat in the 5' 
      untranslated region of the first exon of the FMR1 gene. Subsequent methylation of 
      the promoter region inhibits expression of the FMR1 gene. In two clinically 
      normal brothers large, expanded CGG repeats and cytogenetically visible fragile 
      sites were found. The FMR1 promoter was unmethylated and both RNA and protein 
      could be detected. This indicates that inactivation of the FMR1 gene and not 
      repeat expansion itself results in the fragile X phenotype. We conclude that 
      repeat expansion does not necessarily induce methylation and that methylation is 
      no absolute requirement for the induction of fragile sites.

TI  - Non-radioactive DNA diagnosis for the fragile X syndrome in mentally retarded 
      Japanese males.
PG  - 317-21; discussion 323-4
AB  - A rapid screening test was developed to detect CGG repeat expansion of the FMR-1 
      gene causing the fragile X syndrome by a non-radioisotope PCR technique. A 
      biotin-labeled primer was initially used and the biotin-labeled PCR product was 
      detected by means of chemiluminescence. The normal PCR product of around 300 bp 
      was not created in the abnormal FMR-1 gene sample with this method. Four positive 
      samples were found among those from 226 mentally retarded males, but the CGG 
      repeat expansion was shown on Southern blot analysis in only one sample. To 
      eliminate false-positive samples, a hybridization method involving a 
      biotin-labeled (CGG)s oligonucleotide was developed for the PCR product and the 
      CGG repeat expansion could be detected. Finally, 256 mentally retarded males in 
      Japan were examined and only 2 abnormal samples were detected. The prevalence of 
      this abnormality was less than 1%, which is relatively lower than those reported 
      previously.

TI  - Translational suppression by trinucleotide repeat expansion at FMR1.
PG  - 731-4
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the result of the unstable expansion of a trinucleotide 
      repeat in the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. Fibroblast subclones from 
      a mildly affected patient, each containing stable FMR1 alleles with 57 to 285 CGG 
      repeats, were shown to exhibit normal steady-state levels of FMR1 messenger RNA. 
      However, FMR protein was markedly diminished from transcript with more than 200 
      repeats. Such transcripts were associated with stalled 40S ribosomal subunits. 
      These results suggest that a structural RNA transition beyond 200 repeats impedes 
      the linear 40S migration along the 5'-untranslated region. This results in 
      translational inhibition by trinucleotide repeat expansion.

TI  - Screening for CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 gene in schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 157-60
AB  - Patients diagnosed using DSM-III-R criteria as having schizophrenia and other 
      related disorders (n = 128) were assessed for CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR-1) gene. One subject, a woman with 
      schizophreniform disorder, was found to have a premutation of the gene. Her case 
      report is given. The present investigation supports the view that mutation or 
      premutation of the FMR-1 gene is not of importance for the aetiology of the vast 
      majority of schizophrenic patients.

TI  - The cloning of FRAXF: trinucleotide repeat expansion and methylation at a third 
      fragile site in distal Xqter.
PG  - 2115-21
AB  - Three fragile sites, FRAXA, FRAXE and FRAXF lie in the Xq27-28 region of the 
      human X chromosome. The expression of FRAXA is associated with the fragile X 
      syndrome, the most prevalent form of inherited mental retardation whilst the 
      expression of FRAXE is associated with a rarer and comparatively milder form of 
      mental handicap. Both the FRAXA and FRAXE sites have been cloned and the fragile 
      site expression found to be due to the expansion of analogous CGG/GCC 
      trinucleotide repeat arrays. We describe here the cloning of the third fragile 
      site, FRAXF, and demonstrate that it involves the expansion of a (GCCGTC)n(GCC)n 
      compound array. PCR analyses across the repeat of normal individuals show that 
      the number of triplets in the array ranges from 12-26 and the most common allele 
      consists of 14 triplet units. Sequencing analyses show that 95% of normal 
      individuals have three copies of the GCCGTC motif and in these individuals, the 
      size variation observed by PCR is due to copy number alterations in the GCC 
      array. In a cytogenetically positive male with developmental delay, the array is 
      expanded by > 900 triplets and the adjacent CpG-rich region is methylated. The 
      array is also expanded in cytogenetically positive carrier females from the 
      family originally used to define the FRAXF site. We conclude that the expanded 
      array corresponds to the FRAXF fragile site.

TI  - Triplet repeat expansion at the FRAXE locus and X-linked mild mental handicap.
PG  - 81-6
AB  - We have recently shown that the expression of the FRAXE fragile site in Xq28 is 
      associated with the expansion of a GCC trinucleotide repeat. In the families 
      studied, FRAXE expression is also associated with mild mental handicap. Here we 
      present data on families that previously had been diagnosed as having the fragile 
      X syndrome but that later were found to be negative for trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion at the FRAXA locus. In these families we demonstrate the presence of a 
      GCC trinucleotide repeat expansion at the FRAXE locus. Studies of the FRAXE locus 
      of normal individuals show that they have 6-25 copies of the repeat, whereas 
      affected individuals have > 200 copies. As in the fragile X syndrome, the 
      amplified CpG residues are methylated in affected males.

TI  - A complex mutable polymorphism located within the fragile X gene.
PG  - 248-53
AB  - While studying founder chromosomes in the fragile X syndrome, we have 
      unexpectedly found linkage equilibrium to FRAXAC2, an Alu-associated 
      microsatellite within the defective gene, FMR-1. DNA sequencing of 265 
      chromosomes revealed 39 alleles and a complex microsatellite of form 
      (GT)x-C-(TA)y-(T)z. A mutation rate of 3.3% was observed but only among fragile X 
      maternally derived meioses. Finding a second mutable locus within FMR-1 suggests 
      that the target for tandem repeat instability may not be confined to the (CGG)n 
      repeat alone and raises the possibility of an FMR-1 mutation mechanism involving 
      microsatellites.

TI  - FMR1 protein: conserved RNP family domains and selective RNA binding.
PG  - 563-6
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the result of transcriptional suppression of the gene FMR1 
      as a result of a trinucleotide repeat expansion mutation. The normal function of 
      the FMR1 protein (FMRP) and the mechanism by which its absence leads to mental 
      retardation are unknown. Ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) domains were identified 
      within FMRP, and RNA was shown to bind in stoichiometric ratios, which suggests 
      that there are two RNA binding sites per FMRP molecule. FMRP was able to bind to 
      its own message with high affinity (dissociation constant = 5.7 nM) and 
      interacted with approximately 4 percent of human fetal brain messages. The 
      absence of the normal interaction of FMRP with a subset of RNA molecules might 
      result in the pleiotropic phenotype associated with fragile X syndrome.

TI  - Fragile X syndrome unstable element, p(CCG)n, and other simple tandem repeat 
      sequences are binding sites for specific nuclear proteins.
PG  - 1429-35
AB  - The trinucleotide repeat sequences which become unstable in fragile X syndrome 
      and myotonic dystrophy are located in the untranslated regions of their 
      respective genes, FMR1 and DM1. This implies that a functional constraint other 
      than coding capacity maintains the presence of the repeats. In the case of 
      fragile X syndrome, sequences adjacent to the repeat are methylated in affected 
      individuals and the FMR1 gene is transcriptionally inactive. We demonstrate that 
      the fragile X p(CCG)n repeat itself is methylated in vivo and that methylation of 
      this repeat is able to inhibit in vitro binding of a novel, specific nuclear 
      p(CCG)n binding protein (CCG-BP1)--one of at least 10 distinct simple tandem 
      repeat sequence binding proteins (STR-BPs). We describe additional, apparently 
      distinct, binding activities both for the methylated form of the p(CCG)n repeat 
      and for each of the single strands of the repeat.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat amplification and hypermethylation of a CpG island in FRAXE 
      mental retardation.
PG  - 127-34
AB  - We have cloned the fragile site FRAXE and demonstrate that individuals with this 
      fragile site possess amplifications of a GCC repeat adjacent to a CpG island in 
      Xq28 of the human X chromosome. Normal individuals have 6-25 copies of the GCC 
      repeat, whereas mentally retarded, FRAXE-positive individuals have > 200 copies 
      and also have methylation at the CpG island. This situation is similar to that 
      seen at the FRAXA locus and is another example in which a trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion is associated with a human genetic disorder. In contrast with the 
      fragile X syndrome, the GCC repeat can expand or contract and is equally unstable 
      when passed through the male or female line. These results also have implications 
      for the understanding of chromosome fragility.
