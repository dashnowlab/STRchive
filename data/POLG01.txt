AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetics of cerebellar ataxia is complex. Hundreds of causative 
      genes have been identified, but only a few cause more than single cases. The 
      spectrum of ataxia-causing genes differs considerably between populations. The 
      aim of the study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of ataxia in the 
      Finnish population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients in hospital database were 
      reviewed for the diagnosis of unspecified ataxia. Acquired ataxias and nongenetic 
      ataxias such as those related to infection, trauma or stroke were excluded. Sixty 
      patients with sporadic ataxia with unknown etiology and 36 patients with familial 
      ataxia of unknown etiology were recruited in the study. Repeat expansions in the 
      SCA genes (ATXN1, 2, 3, 7, 8/OS, CACNA1A, TBP), FXN, and RFC1 were determined. 
      Point mutations in POLG, SPG7 and in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were investigated. 
      In addition, DNA from 8 patients was exome sequenced. RESULTS: A genetic cause of 
      ataxia was found in 33 patients (34.4%). Seven patients had a dominantly 
      inherited repeat expansion in ATXN8/OS. Ten patients had mitochondrial ataxia 
      resulting from mutations in nuclear mitochondrial genes POLG or RARS2, or from a 
      point mutation m.8561C > G or a single deletion in mtDNA. Interestingly, five 
      patients were biallelic for the recently identified pathogenic repeat expansion 
      in RFC1. All the five patients presented with the phenotype of cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia (CANVAS). Moreover, screening of 54 patients 
      with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy revealed four additional patients with 
      biallelic repeat expansion in RFC1, but none of them had cerebellar symptoms. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Expansion in ATXN8/OS results in the majority of dominant ataxias in 
      Finland, while mutations in RFC1 and POLG are the most common cause of recessive 
      ataxias. Our results suggest that analysis of RFC1 should be included in the 
      routine diagnostics of idiopathic ataxia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth polyneuropathy.

TI  - A panel study on patients with dominant cerebellar ataxia highlights the 
      frequency of channelopathies.

AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias have a marked heterogeneous genetic 
      background, with mutations in 34 genes identified so far. This large amount of 
      implicated genes accounts for heterogeneous clinical presentations, making 
      genotype-phenotype correlations a major challenge in the field. While 
      polyglutamine ataxias, linked to CAG repeat expansions in genes such as ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, CACNA1A and TBP, have been extensively characterized in 
      large cohorts, there is a need for comprehensive assessment of frequency and 
      phenotype of more 'conventional' ataxias. After exclusion of CAG/polyglutamine 
      expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia genes in 412 index cases with dominantly 
      inherited cerebellar ataxias, we aimed to establish the relative frequencies of 
      mutations in other genes, with an approach combining panel sequencing and TaqMan(R) 
      polymerase chain reaction assay. We found relevant genetic variants in 59 
      patients (14.3%). The most frequently mutated were channel genes [CACNA1A (n = 
      16), KCND3 (n = 4), KCNC3 (n = 2) and KCNA1 (n = 2)]. Deletions in ITPR1 (n = 11) 
      were followed by biallelic variants in SPG7 (n = 9). Variants in AFG3L2 (n = 7) 
      came next in frequency, and variants were rarely found in STBN2 (n = 2), ELOVL5, 
      FGF14, STUB1 and TTBK2 (n = 1 each). Interestingly, possible risk factor variants 
      were detected in SPG7 and POLG. Clinical comparisons showed that ataxias due to 
      channelopathies had a significantly earlier age at onset with an average of 24.6 
      years, versus 40.9 years for polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias and 
      37.8 years for SPG7-related forms (P = 0.001). In contrast, disease duration was 
      significantly longer in the former (20.5 years versus 9.3 and 13.7, P=0.001), 
      though for similar functional stages, indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. Of interest, intellectual deficiency was more frequent in channel 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, while cognitive impairment in adulthood was similar 
      among the three groups. Similar differences were found among a single gene group, 
      comparing 23 patients with CACNA1A expansions (spinocerebellar ataxia 6) to 22 
      patients with CACNA1A point mutations, which had lower average age at onset (25.2 
      versus 47.3 years) with longer disease duration (18.7 versus 10.9), but lower 
      severity indexes (0.39 versus 0.44), indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. In conclusion, we identified relevant genetic variations in up to 15% of 
      cases after exclusion of polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias, and 
      confirmed CACNA1A and SPG7 as major ataxia genes. We could delineate firm 
      genotype-phenotype correlations that are important for genetic counselling and of 
      possible prognostic value.

TI  - Mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma gene polymorphism is not associated with male 
      infertility.
PG  - 1109-14

AB  - PURPOSE: CAG repeat length of human miotochondrial DNA Polymerase gamma (POLG) 
      gene is polymorphic with a major allele at 10 repeats and considered as the 
      common allele whereas the mutant alleles (not 10/not 10 CAG repeats) were found 
      to be associated with oligospermia / oligoasthenospermia in male infertility. To 
      explore whether CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in exon 1 of POLG gene is 
      associated with spermatogenic failure. METHODS: One hundred twenty four infertile 
      men (sperm count <20 million/ml) and 60 normozoospermic (sperm count 
      >20 million/ml) control Indian men of Tamil Nadu, were enrolled. DNA was 
      extracted from 10 ml of peripheral blood and from semen using standard 
      procedures. CAG repeat expansion was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. 
      Amplified products were quantified by 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis and 
      subjected to genescan analysis to ascertain the size of POLG-CAG alleles. 
      RESULTS: This analysis interestingly revealed that the common allele 10 (10-CAG 
      repeats) was widespread in infertile and normozoospermic control men with a 
      frequency of 79 % and 71.7 % respectively. No statistical significance was found 
      in POLG genotypic frequency distribution between infertile men and normospermic 
      men. CONCLUSION: The present study confirmed no association between the POLG gene 
      polymorphism and male infertility. Thus, if associated with infertility, the POLG 
      gene polymorphism should be only considered as a minor possible contributing 
      factor in infertile male patients with no impact on obtaining a pregnancy.

TI  - POLG, but not PEO1, is a frequent cause of cerebellar ataxia in Central Europe.
PG  - 2678-82
LID - 10.1002/mds.23286 [doi]
AB  - Nuclear genes, in particular mitochondrial polymerase gamma (POLG) and PEO1, have 
      been increasingly recognized to cause mitochondrial diseases. Both genes assume a 
      complementary role as part of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication fork and, 
      accordingly, seem to present with largely overlapping phenotypical spectra. We 
      assessed the frequency and phenotypic spectrum of PEO1 compared to POLG mutations 
      in a cohort of 80 patients with cerebellar ataxia for which common repeat 
      expansion diseases had been excluded. Patients were selected to present 
      additional features previously described for PEO1 mutations, namely early age of 
      onset, progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), or epilepsy. Whereas PEO1 
      mutations were not found in our cohort, POLG frequently caused ataxia with PEO 
      (47%), psychiatric comorbidities (20%) and, more rarely, with epilepsy (14%). 
      Thus, PEO1 is rare in Central Europe even in those patients displaying 
      characteristic phenotypic features. In contrast, POLG is rather common in Central 
      European ataxia patients. It should be particularly considered in ataxia patients 
      with PEO, psychiatric comorbidities, and/or sensory neuropathy, even if 
      characteristic mitochondrial extra-CNS features are absent.

TI  - Lack of correlation between length variation in the DNA polymerase gamma gene CAG 
      repeat and lactic acidosis or neuropathy during antiretroviral treatment.
PG  - 531-4
AB  - Antiretroviral therapy, although successful in reducing HIV load and accordingly 
      decreasing the incidence of HIV infection-related symptoms, has its drawbacks in 
      the form of severe side effects. Recognized drug-related side effects are, for 
      example, nausea, fatigue, lactic acidosis, neuropathy, lipodystrophy, and 
      myopathy. Because not all patients experience these side effects, genetic factors 
      could be involved. It is believed that the main toxicity of nucleoside analog 
      drugs is due to a decrease in mitochondrial function, possibly by inhibition of 
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication. mtDNA is replicated by a multienzyme 
      complex, the main component of which is the nuclear-encoded DNA polymerase gamma. 
      Presently, the only known variation in the DNA polymerase gamma gene is variation 
      in the number of CAG repeats in the second exon. To investigate whether CAG 
      repeat expansion or mutations in the DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) gene could 
      predispose to peripheral neuropathy or lactic acidosis, we have sequenced part of 
      the second exon of the DNA polymerase gamma gene, containing the CAG repeat, of 
      59 drug-treated HIV-infected patients, 11 of whom experienced drug-induced 
      neuropathy, and 3 of whom died from lactic acidosis. No correlation was found 
      between numbers of CAG repeats and any of the symptoms. The coding regions of the 
      POLG gene from the three lactic acidosis patients were then completely sequenced, 
      but no mutations were found. In addition, no variation was detected in exons 3, 
      8, and 19 of seven neuropathy patients and three control subjects without 
      symptoms. These exons were the only sites of amino acid changes between human and 
      chimpanzee POLG genes, and were chosen as targets of tolerated variation.

TI  - Analysis of the trinucleotide CAG repeat from the human mitochondrial DNA 
      polymerase gene in healthy and diseased individuals.
PG  - 140-6
AB  - The human nuclear gene (POLG) for the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA 
      polymerase (DNA polymerase gamma) contains a trinucleotide CAG microsatellite 
      repeat within the coding sequence. We have investigated the frequency of 
      different repeat-length alleles in populations of diseased and healthy 
      individuals. The predominant allele of 10 CAG repeats was found at a very similar 
      frequency (approximately 88%) in both Finnish and ethnically mixed population 
      samples, with homozygosity close to the equilibrium prediction. Other alleles of 
      between 5 and 13 repeat units were detected, but no larger, expanded alleles were 
      found. A series of 51 British myotonic dystrophy patients showed no significant 
      variation from controls, indicating an absence of generalised CAG repeat 
      instability. Patients with a variety of molecular lesions in mtDNA, including 
      sporadic, clonal deletions, maternally inherited point mutations, autosomally 
      transmitted mtDNA depletion and autosomal dominant multiple deletions showed no 
      differences in POLG trinucleotide repeat-length distribution from controls. These 
      findings rule out POLG repeat expansion as a common pathogenic mechanism in 
      disorders characterised by mitochondrial genome instability.
