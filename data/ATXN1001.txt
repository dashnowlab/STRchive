AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal-dominant disorder caused 
      by an expanded pentanucleotide repeat in the ATXN10 gene. This repeat expansion, 
      when fully penetrant, has a size of 850-4,500 repeats. It has been shown that the 
      repeat composition can be a modifier of disease, e.g., seizures. Here, we 
      describe a Mexican kindred in which we identified both pure (ATTCT)(n) and mixed 
      (ATTCT)(n)-(ATTCC)(n) expansions in the same family. We used amplification-free 
      targeted sequencing and optical genome mapping to decipher the composition of 
      these repeat expansions. We found a considerable degree of mosaicism of the 
      repeat expansion. This mosaicism was confirmed in skin fibroblasts from 
      individuals with ATXN10 expansions with RNAScope in situ hybridization. All 
      affected family members with the mixed ATXN10 repeat expansion showed typical 
      clinical signs of spinocerebellar ataxia and epilepsy. In contrast, individuals 
      with the pure ATXN10 expansion present with Parkinson's disease or are 
      unaffected, even in individuals more than 20 years older than the average age at 
      onset for SCA10. Our findings suggest that the pure (ATTCT)(n) expansion is 
      non-pathogenic, while repeat interruptions, e.g., (ATTCC)(n), are necessary to 
      cause SCA10. This mechanism has been recently described for several other repeat 
      expansions including SCA31 (BEAN1), SCA37 (DAB1), and three loci for benign adult 
      familial myoclonic epilepsy BAFME (SAMD12, TNRC6A, RAPGEF2). Therefore, long-read 
      sequencing and optical genome mapping of the entire genomic structure of repeat 
      expansions are critical for clinical practice and genetic counseling, as 
      variations in the repeat can affect disease penetrance, symptoms, and disease 
      trajectory.

TI  - A FEMALE CASE OF SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA TYPE 10 WITH SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR AND 
      ENDOCRINPATHIES ASSOCIATED WITH A MASSIVE EXPANSION (ATTCT) OF THE GENE ATXN10.
PG  - 58-62
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is characteri- zed by ataxia, psychiatric 
      disorders convulsions, and locus at 22q13.311. It is caused by expansions between 
      800-4500 pentanucleotide ATTCT repeats in intron 9 of the ATXN10 gene1-2. The 
      ATXN10 gene encodes ataxin-10 protein (known as E46L) involved in neuritogenesis 
      1. SCA10 has a founder origin in Mexican, Brazilian, Argentine populattons but is 
      rare in others.

TI  - ATXN10 Is Required for Embryonic Heart Development and Maintenance of Epithelial 
      Cell Phenotypes in the Adult Kidney and Pancreas.
PG  - 705182

AB  - Atxn10 is a gene known for its role in cytokinesis and is associated with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA10), a slowly progressing cerebellar syndrome caused 
      by an intragenic pentanucleotide repeat expansion. Atxn10 is also implicated in 
      the ciliopathy syndromes nephronophthisis (NPHP) and Joubert syndrome (JBTS), 
      which are caused by the disruption of cilia function leading to nephron loss, 
      impaired renal function, and cerebellar hypoplasia. How Atxn10 disruption 
      contributes to these disorders remains unknown. Here, we generated Atxn10 
      congenital and conditional mutant mouse models. Our data indicate that while 
      ATXN10 protein can be detected around the base of the cilium as well as in the 
      cytosol, its loss does not cause overt changes in cilia formation or morphology. 
      Congenital loss of Atxn10 results in embryonic lethality around E10.5 associated 
      with pericardial effusion and loss of trabeculation. Similarly, tissue-specific 
      loss of ATXN10 in the developing endothelium (Tie2-Cre) and myocardium (cTnT-Cre) 
      also results in embryonic lethality with severe cardiac malformations occurring 
      in the latter. Using an inducible Cagg-CreER to disrupt ATXN10 systemically at 
      postnatal stages, we show that ATXN10 is also required for survival in adult 
      mice. Loss of ATXN10 results in severe pancreatic and renal abnormalities leading 
      to lethality within a few weeks post ATXN10 deletion in adult mice. Evaluation of 
      these phenotypes further identified rapid epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition 
      (EMT) in these tissues. In the pancreas, the phenotype includes signs of both 
      acinar to ductal metaplasia and EMT with aberrant cilia formation and severe 
      defects in glucose homeostasis related to pancreatic insufficiency or defects in 
      feeding or nutrient intake. Collectively, this study identifies ATXN10 as an 
      essential protein for survival.

AB  - PURPOSE: Investigate single nucleotide variants and short tandem repeats in 39 
      genes related to spinocerebellar ataxia in clinical and pathologically defined 
      cohorts of multiple system atrophy. METHODS: Exome sequencing was conducted in 28 
      clinical multiple system atrophy patients to identify single nucleotide variants 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes. Novel variants were validated in two 
      independent disease cohorts: 86 clinically diagnosed multiple system atrophy 
      patients and 166 pathological multiple system atrophy cases. Expanded repeat 
      alleles in spinocerebellar ataxia genes were evaluated in 36 clinically diagnosed 
      multiple system atrophy patients, and CAG/CAA repeats in TATA-Box Binding Protein 
      (TBP, causative of SCA17) were screened in 216 clinical and pathological multiple 
      system atrophy patients and 346 controls. RESULTS: No known pathogenic 
      spinocerebellar ataxia single nucleotide variants or pathogenic range expanded 
      repeat alleles of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, AXTN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, 
      and TBP were detected in any clinical multiple system atrophy patients. However, 
      four novel variants were identified in four spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes 
      across three multiple system atrophy patients. Additionally, four multiple system 
      atrophy patients (1.6%) and one control (0.3%) carried an intermediate length 41 
      TBP CAG/CAA repeat allele (OR = 4.11, P = 0.21). There was a significant 
      association between the occurrence of a repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) and an increased risk of multiple system atrophy (OR = 1.64, P = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: Occurrence of TBP CAG/CAA repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) is significantly associated with increased multiple system atrophy risk. 
      This discovery warrants further investigation and supports a possible genetic 
      overlap of multiple system atrophy with SCA17.

TI  - Minidumbbell structures formed by ATTCT pentanucleotide repeats in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 10.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a progressive genetic disorder caused 
      by ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat expansions in intron 9 of the ATXN10 gene. ATTCT 
      repeats have been reported to form unwound secondary structures which are likely 
      linked to large-scale repeat expansions. In this study, we performed 
      high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic investigations on DNA 
      sequences containing two to five ATTCT repeats. Strikingly, we found the first 
      two repeats of all these sequences well folded into highly compact minidumbbell 
      (MDB) structures. The 3D solution structure of the sequence containing two ATTCT 
      repeats was successfully determined, revealing the MDB comprises a regular TTCTA 
      and a quasi TTCT/A pentaloops with extensive stabilizing loop-loop interactions. 
      We further carried out in vitro primer extension assays to examine if the MDB 
      formed in the primer could escape from the proofreading function of DNA 
      polymerase. Results showed that when the MDB was formed at 5-bp or farther away 
      from the priming site, it was able to escape from the proofreading by Klenow 
      fragment of DNA polymerase I and thus retained in the primer. The intriguing 
      structural findings bring about new insights into the origin of genetic 
      instability in SCA10.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10): Mutation analysis and common haplotype 
      based inference suggest its rarity in Indian population.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a rare autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia caused by nucleotide ATTCT expansion in ATXN10 gene. SCA10 has been 
      reported in patients of cerebellar ataxia from Amerindian/Latin America and in 
      East Asian ancestry. A common founder has been ascribed to the origin of ATTCT 
      repeat expansion mutation in both the population. Here we present our 
      investigation of the SCA10 pentanucleotide repeat expansion in 461 SCA patients 
      of the Indian population. The analysis of multi-ethnic at-risk haplotype 
      C-(ATTCT)n-GGC was performed using genotype data of various ethnic population 
      included in the 1000 Genomes Project (KGP) to infer the prevalence of at-risk 
      haplotype in the Indian populations. Unsurprisingly, none of the patient's DNA 
      samples with (ATTCT)n expansion was observed in pathological range, however, the 
      observed normal range of (ATTCT)n was 8-22 repeats, suggesting very rare or 
      absence of the occurrence of SCA10 in Indian SCA patients. The at-risk haplotype, 
      CGGC was found to be the most prevalent haplotype across different populations 
      and no segregation of CGGC haplotype with large normal or small normal ATTCT 
      repeats length was observed. However, on extended haplotype analysis, some 
      lineage of CGGC with a flanking divergence at 5' end was observed specifically in 
      the American or East Asian population but not in other population in KGP dataset. 
      Together, these evidence points towards the absence of SCA10 in Indian population 
      and haplotype-based analysis also suggests its occurrence to be rare in South 
      Asian, European and African population. Further investigations are required to 
      establish the present finding. SIGNIFICANCE: The implications of the findings of 
      this study are 1.) For the diagnostic work-up of SCAs in the Indian population 
      and to decide upon inclusion of SCA10 in panel based genetic investigations even 
      for Indians living abroad. 2.) The haplotype based inference of its presumptive 
      prevalence through the estimation of at-risk haplotype using population genetics 
      approach (South-Asians as the background) allowed us to estimate the possible 
      absence of SCA10 in Indian population. SCA10 is a rare autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia mostly reported among SCA patients from Latin America and 
      recently described in East Asia population. The genetic study of SCA10 performed 
      in the unrelated Indian spinocerebellar ataxia patients with heterogeneous 
      ethnicity confirmed its absence from the Indian population and that conforms to 
      population genetic based inference of its rarity or absence. 3.) This approach 
      may be adopted for the screening of other subtypes of SCAs, i.e. other rare SCAs 
      e.g. SCA31, SCA36, and SCA37.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a hereditary 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by repeat expansions in the ATXN10 gene. 
      Patients present with cerebellar ataxia frequently accompanied by seizures. Even 
      though loss of cerebellar Purkinje neurons has been described, its brain 
      degeneration pattern is unknown. Our aim was to characterize the gray and white 
      matter degeneration patterns in SCA10 patients and the association with clinical 
      features. METHODS: We enrolled 18 patients with molecular diagnosis of SCA10 and 
      18 healthy individuals matched for age and sex. All participants underwent brain 
      MRI including high-resolution anatomical and diffusion images. Whole-brain 
      Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) and Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) were 
      performed to identify white and grey matter degeneration respectively. A second 
      analysis in the cerebellum identified the unbiased pattern of degeneration. Motor 
      impairment was assessed using the SARA Scale. RESULTS: TBSS analysis in the 
      patient group revealed white matter atrophy exclusively in the cerebellum. VBM 
      analysis showed extensive grey matter degeneration in the cerebellum, brainstem, 
      thalamus, and putamen. Significant associations between cerebellar degeneration 
      and SARA scores were found. Additionally, degeneration in thalamic GM and WM in 
      the cerebellar lobule VI were significantly associated with the presence of 
      seizures. CONCLUSION: The results show that besides cerebellum and brainstem, 
      brain degeneration in SCA10 includes predominantly the putamen and thalamus; 
      involvement of the latter is strongly associated with seizures. Analysis of the 
      unbiased degeneration pattern in the cerebellum suggests lobules VIIIb, IX, and X 
      as the primary cerebellar targets of the disease, which expands to the anterior 
      lobe in later stages.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a repeat expansion disease occurring 
      mostly in Latin America, suggesting that the mutation spread with the peopling of 
      the Americas, or that Amerindian populations, have a higher ATXN10 mutability. 
      High frequency of large normal alleles is associated with prevalence and relative 
      frequency of other repeat expansion diseases. To test whether the allele 
      distribution of the SCA10-causing ATXN10 microsatellite in an Amerindian Peruvian 
      population differs from that of other populations. The ATXN10 allele distribution 
      in a Quechua Peruvian population from Puno, Peru, is similar to that of Finland. 
      Mean allele size and mode were also similar to those of Mexico, Japan, and white 
      Europeans. ATXN10 allele distribution in a healthy Amerindian population from 
      Peru does not differ from that of other populations.

AB  - Large, non-coding pentanucleotide repeat expansions of ATTCT in intron 9 of the 
      ATXN10 gene typically cause progressive spinocerebellar ataxia with or without 
      seizures and present neuropathologically with Purkinje cell loss resulting in 
      symmetrical cerebellar atrophy. These ATXN10 repeat expansions can be interrupted 
      by sequence motifs which have been attributed to seizures and are likely to act 
      as genetic modifiers. We identified a Mexican kindred with multiple affected 
      family members with ATXN10 expansions. Four affected family members showed 
      clinical features of spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10). However, one 
      affected individual presented with early-onset levodopa-responsive parkinsonism, 
      and one family member carried a large repeat ATXN10 expansion, but was clinically 
      unaffected. To characterize the ATXN10 repeat, we used a novel technology of 
      single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing and CRISPR/Cas9-based capture. We 
      sequenced the entire span of ~5.3-7.0 kb repeat expansions. The Parkinson's 
      patient carried an ATXN10 expansion with no repeat interruption motifs as well as 
      an unaffected sister. In the siblings with typical SCA10, we found a repeat 
      pattern of ATTCC repeat motifs that have not been associated with seizures 
      previously. Our data suggest that the absence of repeat interruptions is likely a 
      genetic modifier for the clinical presentation of l-Dopa responsive parkinsonism, 
      whereas repeat interruption motifs contribute clinically to epilepsy. Repeat 
      interruptions are important genetic modifiers of the clinical phenotype in SCA10. 
      Advanced sequencing techniques now allow to better characterize the underlying 
      genetic architecture for determining accurate phenotype-genotype correlations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association of repeat expansion size in 10 common 
      degenerative hereditary ataxia genes with essential tremor. These genes were 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 
      (CACNA1A), SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), 
      SCA-17 (TBP) and dentatorubral-pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA) (ATN1). METHODS: 
      Genetic analysis of repeat size in 10 degenerative hereditary ataxia loci was 
      performed in 323 essential tremor patients and 299 controls enrolled at Columbia 
      University. To test for differences in the allele distribution between patients 
      and controls, a CLUMP analysis was performed. RESULTS: None of the essential 
      tremor patients had a repeat expansion in the intermediate or pathogenic range. 
      Significant differences in the distribution of repeats in the 'normal' range for 
      SCA2 and SCA8 (both p </= 0.02) were observed between essential tremor patients and 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      SCA loci are not associated with essential tremor.

TI  - Crystallographic and Computational Analyses of AUUCU Repeating RNA That Causes 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 10 (SCA10).
PG  - 3851-9
LID - 10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00551 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is caused by a pentanucleotide repeat 
      expansion of r(AUUCU) within intron 9 of the ATXN10 pre-mRNA. The RNA causes 
      disease by a gain-of-function mechanism in which it inactivates proteins involved 
      in RNA biogenesis. Spectroscopic studies showed that r(AUUCU) repeats form a 
      hairpin structure; however, there were no high-resolution structural models prior 
      to this work. Herein, we report the first crystal structure of model r(AUUCU) 
      repeats refined to 2.8 A and analysis of the structure via molecular dynamics 
      simulations. The r(AUUCU) tracts adopt an overall A-form geometry in which 3 x 3 
      nucleotide (5')UCU(3')/(3')UCU(5') internal loops are closed by AU pairs. Helical 
      parameters of the refined structure as well as the corresponding electron density 
      map on the crystallographic model reflect dynamic features of the internal loop. 
      The computational analyses captured dynamic motion of the loop closing pairs, 
      which can form single-stranded conformations with relatively low energies. 
      Overall, the results presented here suggest the possibility for r(AUUCU) repeats 
      to form metastable A-from structures, which can rearrange into single-stranded 
      conformations and attract proteins such as heterogeneous nuclear 
      ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K). The information presented here may aid in the 
      rational design of therapeutics targeting this RNA.

AB  - Intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions in ataxin 2 are a risk factor for 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The polyglutamine tract is encoded by a 
      trinucleotide repeat in a coding region of the ataxin 2 gene (ATXN2). Noncoding 
      nucleotide repeat expansions in several genes are also associated with 
      neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. For example, hexanucleotide repeat 
      expansions located in a noncoding region of C9ORF72 are the most common cause of 
      ALS. We sought to assess a potential larger role of noncoding nucleotide repeat 
      expansions in ALS. We analyzed the nucleotide repeat lengths of 6 genes (ATXN8, 
      ATXN10, PPP2R2B, NOP56, DMPK, and JPH3) that have previously been associated with 
      neurologic or neuromuscular disorders, in several hundred sporadic patients with 
      ALS and healthy control subjects. We report no association between ALS and repeat 
      length in any of these genes, suggesting that variation in the noncoding 
      repetitive regions in these genes does not contribute to ALS.

AB  - We present a unique thirty-nine year old woman with both Huntington's disease 
      (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10). She has 48 CAG repeats in the HD 
      gene and 2511 ATTCT repeats in the ATX10 gene. Although both conditions are 
      repeat expansion diseases they are thought to have quite different pathogenic 
      mechanisms. The symptomatic age of onset in this patient (mid30s) is within the 
      expected range for her repeat expansion sizes for each condition, but we discuss 
      the evidence that the two conditions may interact to produce a more severe 
      cognitive phenotype than would be expected for either of the conditions 
      independently. The subject has Amerindian background on the maternal side from 
      Colombia, South America, thus adding a 5th country expressing SCA10, all with 
      Amerindian ancestry.

AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) encompass a heterogeneous group of 
      rare diseases that affect the cerebellum and its connections. The most common 
      forms have been associated with dynamic mutations while some rarer forms with 
      conventional mutations. Studies in different populations revealed differences in 
      their relative frequencies both within and between the studied populations, 
      showing that the frequencies are depended on ethnic and geographical factors. 
      Previous investigation of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in the Cypriot population, revealed no 
      pathogenic expansion in the Cypriot SCA patients. We hereby present our recent 
      investigation of the SCA10 pentanucleotide repeat expansion. Forty-two 
      ascertained Cypriot sporadic ataxia patients, the index case from 1 ADCA and 14 
      ARCA families and a cohort of normal population individuals were included in the 
      study. All our patients have normal range ATXN10 gene ATTCT repeat numbers 
      (10-19). In the normal population group, repeat lengths ranged from 11 to 20 with 
      the 14 repeats allele being the most frequent. Therefore, all currently 
      established dynamic repeat SCA mutations are absent from the Cypriot population, 
      indicating distinct genetic causes.

TI  - Transgenic mice with SCA10 pentanucleotide repeats show motor phenotype and 
      susceptibility to seizure: a toxic RNA gain-of-function model.
PG  - 706-14
LID - 10.1002/jnr.22786 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder manifested by ataxia and seizure. SCA10 is caused by a large expansion 
      of an intronic ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat in the ATXN10 gene. We have recently 
      postulated a toxic RNA-mediated gain of function in the pathogenesis of spinal 
      cerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10). The spliced intron-9 RNA containing the 
      expanded AUUCU repeat aggregates in SCA10 cells and sequesters hnRNP K. hnRNP K 
      sequestration triggers the translocation of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) to 
      mitochondria, leading to activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis. To confirm the 
      toxic RNA-mediated gain of function, we generated a new transgenic mouse model in 
      which the expanded pentanucleotide repeats are constructed in the 3'-untranslated 
      region (3'UTR) to ensure transcription without translation of the repeat. We 
      constructed an artificial transgene containing the SCA10 (ATTCT)(500) track 
      within the 3'UTR of the LacZ gene driven by the rat prion promoter (PrP) and used 
      this to generate a new transgenic mouse model for SCA10. We then examined these 
      mice for neurological phenotypes and histopathological, molecular, and cellular 
      changes. The transgenic mice showed irregular gait and increased seizure 
      susceptibility at the age of 6 months, resembling the clinical phenotype of 
      SCA10. The cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and pontine nuclei showed neuronal loss. 
      The brains of these animals also showed molecular and cellular changes similar to 
      those previously found in an SCA10 cell model. Expression of the expanded SCA10 
      AUUCU repeat within the 3'UTR of a gene results in neuronal loss with associated 
      gait abnormalities and increased seizure susceptibility phenotypes, which 
      resemble those seen in SCA10 patients. Moreover, these results bolster the idea 
      that the SCA10 disease mechanism is mediated by a toxic RNA gain-of-function 
      mutation of the expanded AUUCU repeat.

TI  - Expansions, contractions, and fragility of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 
      pentanucleotide repeat in yeast.
PG  - 2843-8
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1009409108 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by 
      large-scale expansions of the (ATTCT)(n) repeat within an intron of the human 
      ATXN10 gene. In contrast to other expandable repeats, this pentanucleotide repeat 
      does not form stable intra- or interstranded DNA structures, being a DNA 
      unwinding element instead. We analyzed the instability of the (ATTCT)(n) repeat 
      in a yeast experimental system, where its expansions led to inactivation of the 
      URA3 reporter gene. The inactivation was due to a dramatic decrease in the mRNA 
      levels owing to premature transcription termination and RNA polyadenylation at 
      the repeat. The rates of expansions strongly increased with the repeat's length, 
      mimicking genetic anticipation in human pedigrees. A first round of genetic 
      analysis showed that a functional TOF1 gene precludes, whereas a functional RAD5 
      gene promotes, expansions of the (ATTCT)(n) repeat. We hypothesize that repeat 
      expansions could occur upon fortuitous template switching during DNA replication. 
      The rate of repeat contractions was elevated in the Tof1 knockout strain, but it 
      was not affected by the RAD5 gene. Supporting the notion of replication 
      irregularities, we found that (ATTCT)(n) repeats also cause length-dependent 
      chromosomal fragility in yeast. Repeat-mediated fragility was also affected by 
      the Tof1 and Rad5 proteins, being reduced in their absence.

TI  - The DNA unwinding element binding protein DUE-B interacts with Cdc45 in 
      preinitiation complex formation.
PG  - 1495-507
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00710-09 [doi]
AB  - Template unwinding during DNA replication initiation requires the loading of the 
      MCM helicase activator Cdc45 at replication origins. We show that Cdc45 interacts 
      with the DNA unwinding element (DUE) binding protein DUE-B and that these 
      proteins localize to the DUEs of active replication origins. DUE-B and Cdc45 are 
      not bound at the inactive c-myc replicator in the absence of a functional DUE or 
      at the recently identified ataxin 10 (ATX10) origin, which is silent before 
      disease-related (ATTCT)(n) repeat length expansion of its DUE sequence, despite 
      the presence of the origin recognition complex (ORC) and MCM proteins at these 
      origins. Addition of a heterologous DUE to the ectopic c-myc origin, or expansion 
      of the ATX10 DUE, leads to origin activation, DUE-B binding, and Cdc45 binding. 
      DUE-B, Cdc45, and topoisomerase IIbeta binding protein 1 (TopBP1) form complexes 
      in cell extracts and when expressed from baculovirus vectors. During replication 
      in Xenopus egg extracts, DUE-B and Cdc45 bind to chromatin with similar kinetics, 
      and DUE-B immunodepletion blocks replication and the loading of Cdc45 and a 
      fraction of TopBP1. The coordinated binding of DUE-B and Cdc45 to origins and the 
      physical interactions of DUE-B, Cdc45, and TopBP1 suggest that complexes of these 
      proteins are necessary for replication initiation.

TI  - Alu-mediated acquisition of unstable ATTCT pentanucleotide repeats in the human 
      ATXN10 gene.
PG  - 2573-9
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msp172 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 is caused by ATTCT repeat expansion in the ATXN10 
      gene in humans. We studied the evolutionary history of the human genome to 
      determine the time and mechanism of the acquisition of unstable ATTCT repeats in 
      the genome. We found that long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) was inserted into 
      ATXN10 intron 9; Alu was then inserted in the middle of LINE-1; and endogenous 
      retrovilcus K was lastly retrotransposed in the middle of Alu. The ATTCT repeat 
      was located on the boundary between the 3'-end of the Alu element and the direct 
      repeat arising from LINE-1. We determined nucleotide sequences of the orthologous 
      region of 50 individuals representing 33 primate species and compared them with 
      the human sequence. The analysis revealed that the ATTCT repeat is present only 
      in human and apes. Old World monkeys also possess pentanucleotide repeats, but 
      their motifs are TGTCT and GGTCT. New World monkeys and prosimians are not 
      informative because they lack the corresponding region in ATXN10 intron 9. Our 
      studies dictate two parsimonious scenarios of evolution. First, a TTTCT motif 
      arose from a TTTTT motif at the junction of Alu and LINE-1, which was followed by 
      introduction of A to make an ATTCT motif in hominoids. Second, an ATTCT motif was 
      directly generated from an ancestral ATTTT motif in the common ancestor of 
      catarrhines. We also demonstrate that orangutan uniquely introduced G to make a 
      GTTCT motif and later C to make a GTTCC motif, where newly introduced nucleotides 
      are underlined. Our studies reveal that nucleotide substitutions in a poly(A) 
      tail of the Alu element and the following amplification of pentanucleotides 
      occurred in the lineages of Old World monkeys and hominoids and that unstable 
      ATTCT pentanucleotide repeats originated in the common ancestor of hominoids. 
      These findings also highlight a new aspect of the role of retrotransposons in 
      human disease and evolution, which might be useful in investigating the mystery 
      of human uniqueness.

TI  - Ancestral origin of the ATTCT repeat expansion in spinocerebellar ataxia type 10

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease characterized by cerebellar ataxia and seizures. The disease is caused by 
      a large ATTCT repeat expansion in the ATXN10 gene. The first families reported 
      with SCA10 were of Mexican origin, but the disease was soon after described in 
      Brazilian families of mixed Portuguese and Amerindian ancestry. The origin of the 
      SCA10 expansion and a possible founder effect that would account for its 
      geographical distribution have been the source of speculation over the last 
      years. To unravel the mutational origin and spread of the SCA10 expansion, we 
      performed an extensive haplotype study, using closely linked STR markers and 
      intragenic SNPs, in families from Brazil and Mexico. Our results showed (1) a 
      shared disease haplotype for all Brazilian and one of the Mexican families, and 
      (2) closely-related haplotypes for the additional SCA10 Mexican families; (3) 
      little or null genetic distance in small normal alleles of different repeat 
      sizes, from the same SNP lineage, indicating that they are being originated by a 
      single step mechanism; and (4) a shared haplotype for pure and interrupted 
      expanded alleles, pointing to a gene conversion model for its generation. In 
      conclusion, we show evidence for an ancestral common origin for SCA10 in Latin 
      America, which might have arisen in an ancestral Amerindian population and later 
      have been spread into the mixed populations of Mexico and Brazil.

TI  - Case control analysis of repeat expansion size in ataxia.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurological diseases. The expansion of unstable microsatellite 
      repeats has been identified as the underlying pathogenic cause of 10 subtypes of 
      autosomal dominant SCAs. The aetiology of sporadic SCA is unknown. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effect of large normal repeats in patients 
      presenting with sporadic or familial ataxia compared to a control population. The 
      size of the expansion was determined using a fluorescent PCR approach in 10 
      common SCA genes: SCA-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 (CACNA1A), 
      SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), SCA-17 (TBP) 
      and DRPLA (ATN1), in 165 ataxia patients and 307 controls of Welsh origin. There 
      was no difference between cases and controls in the distribution of the large 
      normal alleles, or in the distribution of the combined CAG repeats. The normal 
      allele distribution in the Welsh population was largely similar to that of other 
      Caucasian populations. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of large normal 
      repeats on the susceptibility to develop ataxia.

TI  - Unstable spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (ATTCT*(AGAAT) repeats are associated 
      with aberrant replication at the ATX10 locus and replication origin-dependent 
      expansion at an ectopic site in human cells.
PG  - 7828-38
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is associated with expansion of (ATTCT)n 
      repeats (where n is the number of repeats) within the ataxin 10 (ATX10/E46L) 
      gene. The demonstration that (ATTCT)n tracts can act as DNA unwinding elements 
      (DUEs) in vitro has suggested that aberrant replication origin activity occurs at 
      expanded (ATTCT)n tracts and may lead to their instability. Here, we confirm 
      these predictions. The wild-type ATX10 locus displays inefficient origin 
      activity, but origin activity is elevated at the expanded ATX10 loci in 
      patient-derived cells. To test whether (ATTCT)n tracts can potentiate origin 
      activity, cell lines were constructed that contain ectopic copies of the c-myc 
      replicator in which the essential DUE was replaced by ATX10 DUEs with (ATTCT)n. 
      ATX10 DUEs containing (ATTCT)27 or (ATTCT)48, but not (ATTCT)8 or (ATTCT)13, 
      could substitute functionally for the c-myc DUE, but (ATTCT)48 could not act as 
      an autonomous replicator. Significantly, chimeric c-myc replicators containing 
      ATX10 DUEs displayed length-dependent (ATTCT)n instability. By 250 population 
      doublings, dramatic two- and fourfold length expansions were observed for 
      (ATTCT)27 and (ATTCT)48 but not for (ATTCT)8 or (ATTCT)13. These results 
      implicate replication origin activity as one molecular mechanism associated with 
      the instability of (ATTCT)n tracts that are longer than normal length.

TI  - The role of ataxin 10 in the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 10.
PG  - 607-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal dominant 
      disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia and seizures. SCA10 is caused by an 
      expansion of an ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat in intron 9 of the ataxin 10 
      (ATXN10) gene encoding an approximately 55-kd protein of unknown function. 
      However, how this mutation leads to SCA10 is unknown. METHODS: In an effort to 
      understand the pathogenic mechanism of SCA10, the authors conducted a series of 
      experiments to address the effect of repeat expansion on the transcription and 
      RNA processing of the ATXN10 gene. In addition, we generated Sca10 (mouse ataxin 
      10 homolog)-null mice and addressed the role of Sca10 gene dosage on the 
      cerebellum. RESULTS: Mutant ATXN10 allele is transcribed at the normal level, and 
      the pre-mRNA containing an expanded repeat is processed normally in 
      patient-derived cells. Sca10-null mice exhibited embryonic lethality. 
      Heterozygous mutants were overtly normal and did not develop SCA10 phenotype 
      CONCLUSION: A simple gain of function or loss of function of ATXN10 is unlikely 
      to be the major pathogenic mechanism contributing to the spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 10 phenotype.

TI  - Ataxin 10 induces neuritogenesis via interaction with G-protein beta2 subunit.
PG  - 1170-8
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a dominantly inherited disorder caused 
      by an intronic ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat expansion. The ATXN10 gene encodes a 
      novel protein, ataxin 10, known previously as E46L, which is widely expressed in 
      the brain. Ataxin 10 deficiency has been shown recently to cause increased 
      apoptosis in primary cerebellar cultures, thus implicated in SCA10 pathogenesis. 
      The biologic functions of ataxin 10 remain largely unknown. By using 
      yeast-two-hybrid screening of a human brain cDNA library, we identified the 
      G-protein beta2 subunit (Gbeta2) as an ataxin 10 binding partner, and the 
      interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization in 
      mammalian cells in culture. Overexpression of ataxin 10 in PC12 cells induced 
      neurite extension and enhanced neuronal differentiation induced by nerve growth 
      factor (NGF). Moreover, coexpression of ataxin 10 and Gbeta2 potently activated 
      the Ras-MAP kinase-Elk-1 cascade. Dominant negative Ras or inhibitor of MEK-1/2 
      (U0126) aborted this activation, and blocked morphologic changes, whereas 
      inhibition of TrkA receptor by K252a had no effects. Our data suggest that the 
      ataxin 10-Gbeta2 interaction represents a novel mechanism for inducing 
      neuritogenesis in PC12 cells by activating the Ras-MAP kinase-Elk-1 cascade.

TI  - Ataxin-10, the spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 neurodegenerative disorder protein, 
      is essential for survival of cerebellar neurons.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 10, an autosomal dominant disease characterized 
      by cerebellar ataxia, is caused by a novel pentanucleotide (ATTCT) repeat 
      expansion in the SCA10 gene. Although clinical features of the disease are well 
      characterized, nothing is known so far about the affected SCA10 gene product, 
      ataxin-10 (Atx-10). We have cloned the rat SCA10 gene and expressed the 
      corresponding protein in HEK293 cells. Atx-10 has an apparent molecular mass of 
      approximately 55 kDa and belongs to the family of armadillo repeat proteins. In 
      solution, it tends to form homotrimeric complexes, which associate via a 
      tip-to-tip contact with the concave sides of the molecules facing each other. 
      Atx-10 immunostaining of mouse and human brain sections revealed a predominantly 
      cytoplasmic and perinuclear localization with a clear restriction to 
      olivocerebellar regions. Knock down of SCA10 in primary neuronal cells by small 
      interfering RNAs resulted in an increased apoptosis of cerebellar neurons, 
      arguing for a loss-of-function phenotype in SCA10 patients.
