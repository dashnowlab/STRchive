TI  - CAG Repeat Expansion in THAP11 Is Associated with a Novel Spinocerebellar Ataxia.
PG  - 1282-1293
LID - 10.1002/mds.29412 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: More than 50 loci are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), 
      and the most frequent subtypes share nucleotide repeats expansion, especially CAG 
      expansion. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to confirm a novel SCA 
      subtype caused by CAG expansion. METHODS: We performed long-read whole-genome 
      sequencing combined with linkage analysis in a five-generation Chinese family, 
      and the finding was validated in another pedigree. The three-dimensional 
      structure and function of THAP11 mutant protein were predicted. Polyglutamine 
      (polyQ) toxicity of THAP11 gene with CAG expansion was assessed in skin 
      fibroblasts of patients, human embryonic kidney 293 and Neuro-2a cells. RESULTS: 
      We identified THAP11 as the novel causative SCA gene with CAG repeats ranging 
      from 45 to 100 in patients with ataxia and from 20 to 38 in healthy control 
      subjects. Among the patients, the number of CAA interruptions within CAG repeats 
      was decreased to 3 (up to 5-6 in controls), whereas the number of 3' pure CAG 
      repeats was up to 32 to 87 (4-16 in controls), suggesting that the toxicity of 
      polyQ protein was length dependent on the pure CAG repeats. Intracellular 
      aggregates were observed in cultured skin fibroblasts from patients. THAP11 polyQ 
      protein was more intensely distributed in the cytoplasm of cultured skin 
      fibroblasts from patients, which was replicated with in vitro cultured neuro-2a 
      transfected with 54 or 100 CAG repeats. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a 
      novel SCA subtype caused by intragenic CAG repeat expansion in THAP11 with 
      intracellular aggregation of THAP11 polyQ protein. Our findings extended the 
      spectrum of polyQ diseases and offered a new perspective in understanding 
      polyQ-mediated toxic aggregation. (c) 2023 The Authors. Movement Disorders

TI  - Expansion of the polyQ repeats in THAP11 forms intranuclear aggregation and 
      causes cell G0/G1 arrest.
PG  - 757-67

AB  - Polyglutamine diseases are a group of neurodegenerative disorders caused by 
      expansion of a CAG repeat that encodes polyglutamine in each respective disease 
      gene. The transcription factor THAP11, a member of THAP family, is involved in 
      cell growth, ES cell pluripotency and embryogenesis. Previous studies suggest 
      that THAP11 protein contains a 29-residue repeat polyglutamine motif and the 
      number of polyglutamine ranges from 20 to 41 in Indian population. We have 
      investigated the CAG numbers at the THAP11 locus in normal individuals and 
      neurodegenerative disease patients of Chinese Han population and a 38Q expansion 
      (THAP11(38Q)) was found in patients. Using fluorescence confocal-based cell 
      imaging, THAP11(38Q) protein formed intranuclear inclusions easier than 
      THAP11(29Q) in PC12 cells. Enhanced toxicity was investigated in 
      THAP11(38Q)-expressing cells by growth inhibition and G0/G1 arrest. CREB-mediated 
      transcription activity was inhibited by THAP11(38Q). The transcription factor, 
      TBP, coactivator CBP, and chaperon protein, HSP70, could be recruited to 
      THAP11(38Q). These results indicate that expansion of the polyglutamine in THAP11 
      forms intracellular aggregation and is toxic in PC12 cells, suggesting a putative 
      role of THAP11 in polyglutamine disease.

TI  - SMARCA2 and THAP11: potential candidates for polyglutamine disorders as evidenced 
      from polymorphism and protein-folding simulation studies.
PG  - 596-602

AB  - CAG repeat expansion is the cause of an ever-increasing list of neurodegenerative 
      disorders, especially hereditary ataxias. However, genes responsible for 10-50% 
      of the clinically diagnosed ataxias are still unidentified in different 
      populations. Traditional linkage and repeat expansion-detection based methods 
      complemented with human genome sequence and expression information can now 
      accelerate the pace of identification of putative disease candidates. We have 
      analyzed two CAG repeat containing loci, human SMARCA2 and THAP11, which are 
      expressed in the brain as putative candidates for SCAs, using computational as 
      well as polymorphism scanning approaches. Both loci exhibited features 
      characteristic of genes associated with repeat disorders. These loci are 
      polymorphic with respect to size and interruption pattern in the Indian 
      population. Furthermore, computational analysis of glutamine-stretch embedded 
      domains in the respective proteins predicted these regions to be "natively 
      unfolded" beyond a threshold of 40 glutamines. Comparative genome analysis 
      suggested a stabilizing influence of CAA interspersions in repeat tract in THAP11 
      but not in SMARCA2. Although repeat expansion could not be detected within these 
      genes in unidentified ataxia patients reported in India, we suggest that these 
      loci be screened in other populations, as there is a wide heterogeneity in the 
      prevalence of these disorders in different populations.
