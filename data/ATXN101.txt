AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat expansion in the ATXN1 gene. It is 
      characterized by the presence of polyglutamine (polyQ) intranuclear inclusion 
      bodies (IIBs) within affected neurons. In order to investigate the impact of 
      polyQ IIBs in SCA1 pathogenesis, we generated a novel protein aggregation model 
      by inducible overexpression of the mutant ATXN1(Q82) isoform in human 
      neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, we developed a simple and reproducible 
      protocol for the efficient isolation of insoluble IIBs. Biophysical 
      characterization showed that polyQ IIBs are enriched in RNA molecules which were 
      further identified by next-generation sequencing. Finally, a protein interaction 
      network analysis indicated that sequestration of essential RNA transcripts within 
      ATXN1(Q82) IIBs may affect the ribosome resulting in error-prone protein 
      synthesis and global proteome instability. These findings provide novel insights 
      into the molecular pathogenesis of SCA1, highlighting the role of polyQ IIBs and 
      their impact on critical cellular processes.

AB  - Expansions of repeat DNA tracts cause >70 diseases, and ongoing expansions in 
      brains exacerbate disease. During expansion mutations, single-stranded DNAs 
      (ssDNAs) form slipped-DNAs. We find the ssDNA-binding complexes canonical 
      replication protein A (RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3) and Alternative-RPA (RPA1, RPA3, and 
      primate-specific RPA4) are upregulated in Huntington disease and spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 1 (SCA1) patient brains. Protein interactomes of RPA and Alt-RPA 
      reveal unique and shared partners, including modifiers of CAG instability and 
      disease presentation. RPA enhances in vitro melting, FAN1 excision, and repair of 
      slipped-CAGs and protects against CAG expansions in human cells. RPA 
      overexpression in SCA1 mouse brains ablates expansions, coincident with decreased 
      ATXN1 aggregation, reduced brain DNA damage, improved neuron morphology, and 
      rescued motor phenotypes. In contrast, Alt-RPA inhibits melting, FAN1 excision, 
      and repair of slipped-CAGs and promotes CAG expansions. These findings suggest a 
      functional interplay between the two RPAs where Alt-RPA may antagonistically 
      offset RPA's suppression of disease-associated repeat expansions, which may 
      extend to other DNA processes.

TI  - Widespread alternative splicing dysregulation occurs presymptomatically in CAG 
      expansion spinocerebellar ataxias.

AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative diseases, several of which are caused by CAG expansion 
      mutations (SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 12) and more broadly belong to the large family 
      of over 40 microsatellite expansion diseases. While dysregulation of alternative 
      splicing is a well-defined driver of disease pathogenesis across several 
      microsatellite diseases, the contribution of alternative splicing in CAG 
      expansion SCAs is poorly understood. Furthermore, despite extensive studies on 
      differential gene expression there remains a gap in our understanding of 
      presymptomatic transcriptomic drivers of disease. We sought to address these 
      knowledge gaps through a comprehensive study of 29 publicly available 
      RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) datasets. We identified that dysregulation of 
      alternative splicing is widespread across CAG expansion mouse models of SCAs 1, 3 
      and 7. These changes were detected presymptomatically, persisted throughout 
      disease progression, were repeat length dependent, and were present in brain 
      regions implicated in SCA pathogenesis including the cerebellum, pons, and 
      medulla. Across disease progression, changes in alternative splicing occurred in 
      genes that function in pathways and processes known to be impaired in SCAs, such 
      as ion channels, synaptic signalling, transcriptional regulation, and the 
      cytoskeleton. We validated several key alternative splicing events with known 
      functional consequences, including Trpc3 exon 9 and Kcnma1 exon 23b, in the 
      Atxn1154Q/2Q mouse model. Finally, we demonstrated that alternative splicing 
      dysregulation is responsive to therapeutic intervention in CAG expansion SCAs 
      with Atxn1 targeting antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) rescuing key splicing 
      events. Taken together, these data demonstrate that widespread presymptomatic 
      dysregulation of alternative splicing in CAG expansion SCAs may contribute to 
      disease onset, early neuronal dysfunction and may represent novel biomarkers 
      across this devastating group of neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - There are more than 40 types of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), most of which are 
      caused by abnormal expansion of short tandem repeats at various gene loci. These 
      phenotypically similar disorders require molecular testing at multiple loci by 
      fluorescent PCR and capillary electrophoresis to identify the causative repeat 
      expansion. We describe a simple strategy to screen for the more common SCA1, 
      SCA2, and SCA3 by rapidly detecting the abnormal CAG repeat expansion at the 
      ATXN1, ATXN2, and ATXN3 loci using melting curve analysis of triplet-primed PCR 
      products. Each of the three separate assays employs a plasmid DNA carrying a 
      known repeat size to generate a threshold melt peak temperature, which 
      effectively distinguishes expansion-positive samples from those without a repeat 
      expansion. Samples that are screened positive based on their melt peak profiles 
      are subjected to capillary electrophoresis for repeat sizing and genotype 
      confirmation. These screening assays are robust and provide accurate detection of 
      the repeat expansion while eliminating the need for fluorescent PCR and capillary 
      electrophoresis for every sample.

AB  - Pathogenic short tandem repeat (STR) expansions cause over 20 neurodegenerative 
      diseases. To determine the contribution of STRs in sporadic amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), we used ExpansionHunter, 
      REviewer, and polymerase chain reaction validation to assess 21 neurodegenerative 
      disease-associated STRs in whole-genome sequencing data from 608 patients with 
      sporadic ALS, 68 patients with sporadic FTD, and 4703 matched controls. We also 
      propose a data-derived outlier detection method for defining allele thresholds in 
      rare STRs. Excluding C9orf72 repeat expansions, 17.6% of clinically diagnosed ALS 
      and FTD cases had at least one expanded STR allele reported to be pathogenic or 
      intermediate for another neurodegenerative disease. We identified and validated 
      162 disease-relevant STR expansions in C9orf72 (ALS/FTD), ATXN1 [spinal 
      cerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1)], ATXN2 (SCA2), ATXN8 (SCA8), TBP (SCA17), HTT 
      (Huntington's disease), DMPK [myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)], CNBP (DM2), and 
      FMR1 (fragile-X disorders). Our findings suggest clinical and pathological 
      pleiotropy of neurodegenerative disease genes and highlight their importance in 
      ALS and FTD.

TI  - Genetic variability in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
PG  - 3760-3769
LID - 10.1093/brain/awad120 [doi]
AB  - With the advent of gene therapies for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), there 
      is a surge in gene testing for this disease. Although there is ample experience 
      with gene testing for C9orf72, SOD1, FUS and TARDBP in familial ALS, large 
      studies exploring genetic variation in all ALS-associated genes in sporadic ALS 
      (sALS) are still scarce. Gene testing in a diagnostic setting is challenging, 
      given the complex genetic architecture of sALS, for which there are genetic 
      variants with large and small effect sizes. Guidelines for the interpretation of 
      genetic variants in gene panels and for counselling of patients are lacking. We 
      aimed to provide a thorough characterization of genetic variability in ALS genes 
      by applying the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria 
      on whole genome sequencing data from a large cohort of 6013 sporadic ALS patients 
      and 2411 matched controls from Project MinE. We studied genetic variation in 90 
      ALS-associated genes and applied customized ACMG-criteria to identify pathogenic 
      and likely pathogenic variants. Variants of unknown significance were collected 
      as well. In addition, we determined the length of repeat expansions in C9orf72, 
      ATXN1, ATXN2 and NIPA1 using the ExpansionHunter tool. We found C9orf72 repeat 
      expansions in 5.21% of sALS patients. In 50 ALS-associated genes, we did not 
      identify any pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. In 5.89%, a pathogenic or 
      likely pathogenic variant was found, most commonly in SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, NEK1, 
      OPTN or TBK1. Significantly more cases carried at least one pathogenic or likely 
      pathogenic variant compared to controls (odds ratio 1.75; P-value 1.64 x 10-5). 
      Isolated risk factors in ATXN1, ATXN2, NIPA1 and/or UNC13A were detected in 
      17.33% of cases. In 71.83%, we did not find any genetic clues. A combination of 
      variants was found in 2.88%. This study provides an inventory of pathogenic and 
      likely pathogenic genetic variation in a large cohort of sALS patients. Overall, 
      we identified pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in 11.13% of ALS patients 
      in 38 known ALS genes. In line with the oligogenic hypothesis, we found 
      significantly more combinations of variants in cases compared to controls. Many 
      variants of unknown significance may contribute to ALS risk, but diagnostic 
      algorithms to reliably identify and weigh them are lacking. This work can serve 
      as a resource for counselling and for the assembly of gene panels for ALS. 
      Further characterization of the genetic architecture of sALS is necessary given 
      the growing interest in gene testing in ALS.

      sequencing allows detection of most pathogenic variants in a single step. The 
      ExpansionHunter tool can detect expansions in short-read genome sequencing data. 
      Recent studies have shown that ExpansionHunter can also be used to identify 
      repeat expansions in exome sequencing data. We tested ExpansionHunter on 
      spinocerebellar ataxia exomes in a research context as a second-line analysis, 
      after exclusion of main CAG repeat expansions in half of the probands. First, we 
      confirmed the detection of expansions in seven known expansion carriers and then, 
      after targeted analysis of ATXN1, 2, 3 and 7, CACNA1A, TBP, ATN1, NOP56, AR and 
      HTT in 498 exomes, we found 22 additional pathogenic expansions. Comparison with 
      capillary migration sizing in 247 individuals and confirmation of all expanded 
      alleles detected by ExpansionHunter demonstrated that for these loci, sensitivity 
      and specificity reached 100%. ExpansionHunter detected but underestimated the 
      repeat size for larger expansions, and the normal alleles distribution at each 
      locus should be taken into account to detect expansions. Exome combined with 
      ExpansionHunter is reliable to detect repeat expansions in selected loci as 
      first-line analysis in spinocerebellar ataxia.

AB  - Genetic risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is highly elevated in 
      genetic isolates, like the island population of Malta in the south of Europe, 
      providing a unique opportunity to investigate the genetics of this disease. Here 
      we characterize the clinical phenotype and genetic profile of the largest series 
      of Maltese ALS patients to date identified throughout a 5-year window. Cases and 
      controls underwent neuromuscular assessment and analysis of rare variants in ALS 
      causative or risk genes following whole-genome sequencing. Potentially damaging 
      variants or repeat expansions were identified in more than 45% of all patients. 
      The most commonly affected genes were ALS2, DAO, SETX and SPG11, an infrequent 
      cause of ALS in Europeans. We also confirmed a significant association between 
      ATXN1 intermediate repeats and increased disease risk. Damaging variants in major 
      ALS genes C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP and FUS were however either absent or rare in 
      Maltese ALS patients. Overall, our study underscores a population that is an 
      outlier within Europe and one that represents a high percentage of genetically 
      explained cases.

LID - 3323
AB  - While astrocyte heterogeneity is an important feature of the healthy brain, less 
      is understood about spatiotemporal heterogeneity of astrocytes in brain disease. 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene Ataxin1 (ATXN1). We characterized 
      astrocytes across disease progression in the four clinically relevant brain 
      regions, cerebellum, brainstem, hippocampus, and motor cortex, of Atxn1(154Q/2Q) 
      mice, a knock-in mouse model of SCA1. We found brain region-specific changes in 
      astrocyte density and GFAP expression and area, early in the disease and prior to 
      neuronal loss. Expression of astrocytic core homeostatic genes was also altered 
      in a brain region-specific manner and correlated with neuronal activity, 
      indicating that astrocytes may compensate or exacerbate neuronal dysfunction. 
      Late in disease, expression of astrocytic homeostatic genes was reduced in all 
      four brain regions, indicating loss of astrocyte functions. We observed no 
      obvious correlation between spatiotemporal changes in microglia and 
      spatiotemporal astrocyte alterations, indicating a complex orchestration of glial 
      phenotypes in disease. These results support spatiotemporal diversity of glial 
      phenotypes as an important feature of the brain disease that may contribute to 
      SCA1 pathogenesis in a brain region and disease stage-specific manner.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating, heterogeneous 
      neurodegenerative neuromuscular disease that leads to a fatal outcome within 
      2-5 years, and yet, a precise nature of the association between its major 
      phenotypes and the cerebellar role in ALS pathology remains unknown. Recently, 
      repeat expansions in several genes in which variants appreciably contribute to 
      cerebellar pathology, including C9orf72, NIPA1, ATXN2 and ATXN1, have been found 
      to confer a significant risk for ALS. To better define this relationship, we 
      performed MAGMA gene-based analysis and tissue enrichment analysis using 
      genome-wide association study summary statistics based on a study of 27,205 
      people with ALS and 110,881 controls. Our preliminary results imply a striking 
      cerebellar tissue specificity and further support increasing calls for 
      re-evaluation of the cerebellar role in the ALS pathology.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by a (CAG) repeat expansion in the coding sequence of ATXN1. The 
      primary mechanism of disease in SCA1 is toxic gain of function by 
      polyglutamine-expanded mutant ATXN1 and is compounded by partial loss of 
      wild-type function. Addressing both disease mechanisms, we have shown that 
      virally expressed RNA interference targeting ATXN1 can both prevent and reverse 
      disease phenotypes in SCA1 mice, and that overexpression of the ATXN1 homolog, 
      ataxin 1-like (ATXN1L), improves disease readouts when delivered 
      pre-symptomatically. Here, we combined these therapeutic approaches into two, 
      dual component recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors and tested their 
      ability to reverse disease in symptomatic SCA1 mice using behavior, pathological, 
      and next-generation sequencing assays. Mice treated with vectors expressing human 
      ATXN1L (hATXN1L) alone showed motor improvements and changes in gene expression 
      that reflected increases in pro-development pathways. When hATN1L was combined 
      with miS1, a previously validated microRNA targeting h ATXN1, there was added 
      normalization of disease allele-induced changes in gene expression along with 
      motor improvements. Our data show the additive nature of this two-component 
      approach for a more effective SCA1 therapy.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a presently incurable neurodegenerative 
      disease. Some genes have a causal relationship to ALS, others act as 
      susceptibility and/or risk factors. We aimed to elucidate the role of 14 
      ALS-related genes in the Hungarian ALS population of 183 patients. Mutation 
      screening of major ALS genes was performed. SMN1 and SMN2 genes were examined by 
      multiplex ligation-dependent probe-amplification assay; intermediate repeat 
      expansions in the ATXN1 and ATXN2 genes were analyzed by fragment analysis. 
      Additional variants in putative ALS genes were screened from previously acquired 
      next generation sequencing data. We confirmed the repeat expansion of the 
      C9orf72, ATXN1 and ATXN2 genes as ALS risk factors in this Hungarian cohort. 
      Additionally, we identified a pathogenic SOD1 mutation and suggested its founder 
      effect. A likely pathogenic variant in the MFSD8 gene was detected, and variants 
      of interest were uncovered in the ANXA11 and GLT8D1 genes. We provide valuable 
      data as part of the growing body of work on population-specific aspects of the 
      genetic background of ALS.

TI  - Whole genome sequencing for the diagnosis of neurological repeat expansion 
      disorders in the UK: a retrospective diagnostic accuracy and prospective clinical 
      validation study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansion disorders affect about 1 in 3000 individuals and are 
      clinically heterogeneous diseases caused by expansions of short tandem DNA 
      repeats. Genetic testing is often locus-specific, resulting in underdiagnosis of 
      people who have atypical clinical presentations, especially in paediatric 
      patients without a previous positive family history. Whole genome sequencing is 
      increasingly used as a first-line test for other rare genetic disorders, and we 
      aimed to assess its performance in the diagnosis of patients with neurological 
      repeat expansion disorders. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic 
      accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect the most common repeat expansion 
      loci associated with neurological outcomes (AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, 
      C9orf72, CACNA1A, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, and TBP) using samples obtained within 
      the National Health Service in England from patients who were suspected of having 
      neurological disorders; previous PCR test results were used as the reference 
      standard. The clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat 
      expansions was prospectively examined in previously genetically tested and 
      undiagnosed patients recruited in 2013-17 to the 100 000 Genomes Project in the 
      UK, who were suspected of having a genetic neurological disorder (familial or 
      early-onset forms of ataxia, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, dementia, motor 
      neuron disease, parkinsonian movement disorders, intellectual disability, or 
      neuromuscular disorders). If a repeat expansion call was made using whole genome 
      sequencing, PCR was used to confirm the result. FINDINGS: The diagnostic accuracy 
      of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat expansions was evaluated against 793 
      PCR tests previously performed within the NHS from 404 patients. Whole genome 
      sequencing correctly classified 215 of 221 expanded alleles and 1316 of 1321 
      non-expanded alleles, showing 97.3% sensitivity (95% CI 94.2-99.0) and 99.6% 
      specificity (99.1-99.9) across the 13 disease-associated loci when compared with 
      PCR test results. In samples from 11 631 patients in the 100 000 Genomes Project, 
      whole genome sequencing identified 81 repeat expansions, which were also tested 
      by PCR: 68 were confirmed as repeat expansions in the full pathogenic range, 11 
      were non-pathogenic intermediate expansions or premutations, and two were 
      non-expanded repeats (16% false discovery rate). INTERPRETATION: In our study, 
      whole genome sequencing for the detection of repeat expansions showed high 
      sensitivity and specificity, and it led to identification of neurological repeat 
      expansion disorders in previously undiagnosed patients. These findings support 
      implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical laboratories for diagnosis 
      of patients who have a neurological presentation consistent with a repeat 
      expansion disorder. FUNDING: Medical Research Council, Department of Health and

TI  - Macular Morpho-Functional and Visual Pathways Functional Assessment in Patients 
      with Spinocerebellar Type 1 Ataxia with or without Neurological Signs.
LID - 10.3390/jcm10225271 [doi]
LID - 5271
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA-ATXN1) is an autosomal dominant, 
      neurodegenerative disease, caused by CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin-1 gene 
      (ATXN1). In isolated reports of patients with neurological signs [symptomatic 
      patients (SP)], macular abnormalities have been described. However, no reports 
      exist about macular anomalies in SCA1 subjects carrying the ATXN1 mutation 
      without neurological signs [not symptomatic carriers (NSC)]. Therefore, the main 
      aim of our work was to evaluate whether the macular functional and morphological 
      abnormalities could be detectable in SP, genetically confirmed and with 
      neurological signs, as well as in SCA-ATXN1-NSC, harboring pathogenic CAG 
      expansion in ATXN1. In addition, we investigated whether the macular involvement 
      could be associated or not to an impairment of RGCs and of their fibers and of 
      the neural conduction along the visual pathways. Herein, nine SCA-ATXN1 subjects 
      (6 SP and 3 NSC) underwent the following examinations: visual acuity and 
      chromatic test assessments, fundus oculi (FO) examination, macular and 
      peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL-T) analysis by Spectral 
      domain-Optical Coherence Tomography (Sd-OCT) acquisition, multifocal 
      electroretinogram (mfERG), pattern reversal electroretinogram (PERG) and visual 
      evoked potentials (VEP) recordings. In four eyes of two SP, visual acuity 
      reduction and chromatic abnormalities were observed; in three of them FO changes 
      associated with macular thinning and outer retinal defects were also detected. In 
      three NSC eyes, slight FO abnormalities were associated with qualitative macular 
      morphological changes. By contrast, abnormal mfERG responses (exclusively from 
      foveal and parafoveal areas) were detected in all SP and NSC (18 eyes). No 
      abnormalities of PERG values, RNFL-T, and VEP responses were found, but in one 
      SP, presenting abnormal papillo-macular bundle neural conduction. Results from 
      our SCA-ATXN1 cohort suggest that a macular dysfunction, detectable by mfERG 
      recordings, may occur in the overt disorder, and unexpectedly in the stage of the 
      disease in which there is still an absence of neurological signs. In NSC, an 
      exclusive dysfunction of preganglionic macular elements can be observed, and this 
      is associated with both normal RGCs function and neural conduction along the 
      visual pathways.

TI  - Detection Methods and Status of CAT Interruption of ATXN1 in Korean Patients With 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1.
PG  - 274-277
LID - 10.3343/alm.2022.42.2.274 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by 
      abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin 1 gene (ATXN1). The presence of CAT 
      interruption(s) is important for diagnosing SCA1 in patients with 39-44 repeat 
      alleles, as only uninterrupted alleles are considered abnormal. Determining the 
      CAT interruption status might also be important for patients with >44 repeats, as 
      the length of the longest uninterrupted CAG repeat stretch has been correlated 
      with age at SCA1 onset. We detected CAT interruption(s) in the archived samples 
      of Korean SCA1 patients using a traditional restriction enzyme method and 
      validated the usefulness of a fluorescence-based tethering PCR procedure. Among 
      the 2,312 alleles analyzed from 1,156 patients, we found 17 expanded alleles with 
      >/=39 repeats, 71% of which harbored 39-44 repeats. Restriction enzyme method of 
      six samples (four with 39-44 repeats and two with >44 repeats) revealed that none 
      of the expanded alleles had CAT interruption(s). Tethering PCR showed the 
      characteristic electropherogram pattern expected without CAT interruption(s). 
      Along with the enzyme restriction method, tethering PCR can be applied to 
      determine the number of allele repeats and provide information on CAT 
      interruption(s) in clinical laboratories.

LID - 382
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetics of cerebellar ataxia is complex. Hundreds of causative 
      genes have been identified, but only a few cause more than single cases. The 
      spectrum of ataxia-causing genes differs considerably between populations. The 
      aim of the study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of ataxia in the 
      Finnish population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients in hospital database were 
      reviewed for the diagnosis of unspecified ataxia. Acquired ataxias and nongenetic 
      ataxias such as those related to infection, trauma or stroke were excluded. Sixty 
      patients with sporadic ataxia with unknown etiology and 36 patients with familial 
      ataxia of unknown etiology were recruited in the study. Repeat expansions in the 
      SCA genes (ATXN1, 2, 3, 7, 8/OS, CACNA1A, TBP), FXN, and RFC1 were determined. 
      Point mutations in POLG, SPG7 and in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were investigated. 
      In addition, DNA from 8 patients was exome sequenced. RESULTS: A genetic cause of 
      ataxia was found in 33 patients (34.4%). Seven patients had a dominantly 
      inherited repeat expansion in ATXN8/OS. Ten patients had mitochondrial ataxia 
      resulting from mutations in nuclear mitochondrial genes POLG or RARS2, or from a 
      point mutation m.8561C > G or a single deletion in mtDNA. Interestingly, five 
      patients were biallelic for the recently identified pathogenic repeat expansion 
      in RFC1. All the five patients presented with the phenotype of cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia (CANVAS). Moreover, screening of 54 patients 
      with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy revealed four additional patients with 
      biallelic repeat expansion in RFC1, but none of them had cerebellar symptoms. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Expansion in ATXN8/OS results in the majority of dominant ataxias in 
      Finland, while mutations in RFC1 and POLG are the most common cause of recessive 
      ataxias. Our results suggest that analysis of RFC1 should be included in the 
      routine diagnostics of idiopathic ataxia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth polyneuropathy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening for short tandem repeat (STR) expansions in next-generation 
      sequencing data can enable diagnosis, optimal clinical management/treatment, and 
      accurate genetic counseling of patients with repeat expansion disorders. We aimed 
      to develop an efficient computational workflow for reliable detection of STR 
      expansions in next-generation sequencing data and demonstrate its clinical 
      utility. METHODS: We characterized the performance of eight STR analysis methods 
      (lobSTR, HipSTR, RepeatSeq, ExpansionHunter, TREDPARSE, GangSTR, STRetch, and 
      exSTRa) on next-generation sequencing datasets of samples with known 
      disease-causing full-mutation STR expansions and genomes simulated to harbor 
      repeat expansions at selected loci and optimized their sensitivity. We then used 
      a machine learning decision tree classifier to identify an optimal combination of 
      methods for full-mutation detection. In Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)-aligned 
      genomes, the ensemble approach of using ExpansionHunter, STRetch, and exSTRa 
      performed the best (precision = 82%, recall = 100%, F1-score = 90%). We applied 
      this pipeline to screen 301 families of children with suspected genetic 
      disorders. RESULTS: We identified 10 individuals with full-mutations in the AR, 
      ATXN1, ATXN8, DMPK, FXN, or HTT disease STR locus in the analyzed families. 
      Additional candidates identified in our analysis include two probands with 
      borderline ATXN2 expansions between the established repeat size range for 
      reduced-penetrance and full-penetrance full-mutation and seven individuals with 
      FMR1 CGG repeats in the intermediate/premutation repeat size range. In 67 
      probands with a prior negative clinical PCR test for the FMR1, FXN, or DMPK 
      disease STR locus, or the spinocerebellar ataxia disease STR panel, our pipeline 
      did not falsely identify aberrant expansion. We performed clinical PCR tests on 
      seven (out of 10) full-mutation samples identified by our pipeline and confirmed 
      the expansion status in all, showing absolute concordance between our 
      bioinformatics and molecular findings. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully 
      demonstrated the application of a well-optimized bioinformatics pipeline that 
      promotes the utility of genome-wide sequencing as a first-tier screening test to 
      detect expansions of known disease STRs. Interrogating clinical next-generation 
      sequencing data for pathogenic STR expansions using our ensemble pipeline can 
      improve diagnostic yield and enhance clinical outcomes for patients with repeat 
      expansion disorders.

TI  - Repeats expansions in ATXN2, NOP56, NIPA1 and ATXN1 are not associated with ALS 
      in Africans.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized primarily by progressive loss of motor neurons. Although ALS occurs 
      worldwide and the frequency and spectrum of identifiable genetic causes of 
      disease varies across populations, very few studies have included African 
      subjects. In addition to a hexanucleotide repeat expansion (RE) in C9orf72, the 
      most common genetic cause of ALS in Europeans, REs in ATXN2, NIPA1 and ATXN1 have 
      shown variable associations with ALS in Europeans. Intermediate range expansions 
      in some of these genes (e.g. ATXN2) have been reported as potential risk factors, 
      or phenotypic modifiers, of ALS. Pathogenic expansions in NOP56 cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-36, which can present with prominent motor neuron 
      degeneration. Here we compare REs in these genes in a cohort of Africans with ALS 
      and population controls using whole genome sequencing data. Targeting genotyping 
      of short tandem repeats at known loci within ATXN2, NIPA1, ATXN1 and NOP56 was 
      performed using ExpansionHunter software in 105 Southern African (SA) patients 
      with ALS. African population controls were from an in-house SA population control 
      database (n = 25), the SA Human Genome Program (n = 24), the Simons Genome 
      Diversity Project (n = 39) and the Illumina Polaris Diversity Cohort (IPDC) 
      dataset (n = 50). We found intermediate RE alleles in ATXN2 (27-33 repeats) and 
      ATXN1 (33-35 repeats), and NIPA1 long alleles (>/=8 repeats) were rare in Africans, 
      and not associated with ALS (p > 0.17). NOP56 showed no expanded alleles in 
      either ALS or controls. We also compared the differences in allele distributions 
      between the African and n = 50 European controls (from the IPDC). There was a 
      statistical significant difference in the distribution of the REs in the ATXN1 
      between African and European controls (Chi-test p < 0.001), and NIPA1 showed 
      proportionately more longer alleles (RE > 8) in Europeans vs. Africans (Fisher's 
      p = 0.016). The distribution of RE alleles in ATXN2 and NOP56 were similar 
      amongst African and European controls. In conclusion, repeat expansions in ATXN2, 
      NIPA1 and ATXN1, which showed associations with ALS in Europeans, were not 
      replicated in Southern Africans with ALS.

PG  - 117-125

AB  - PURPOSE: Investigate single nucleotide variants and short tandem repeats in 39 
      genes related to spinocerebellar ataxia in clinical and pathologically defined 
      cohorts of multiple system atrophy. METHODS: Exome sequencing was conducted in 28 
      clinical multiple system atrophy patients to identify single nucleotide variants 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes. Novel variants were validated in two 
      independent disease cohorts: 86 clinically diagnosed multiple system atrophy 
      patients and 166 pathological multiple system atrophy cases. Expanded repeat 
      alleles in spinocerebellar ataxia genes were evaluated in 36 clinically diagnosed 
      multiple system atrophy patients, and CAG/CAA repeats in TATA-Box Binding Protein 
      (TBP, causative of SCA17) were screened in 216 clinical and pathological multiple 
      system atrophy patients and 346 controls. RESULTS: No known pathogenic 
      spinocerebellar ataxia single nucleotide variants or pathogenic range expanded 
      repeat alleles of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, AXTN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, 
      and TBP were detected in any clinical multiple system atrophy patients. However, 
      four novel variants were identified in four spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes 
      across three multiple system atrophy patients. Additionally, four multiple system 
      atrophy patients (1.6%) and one control (0.3%) carried an intermediate length 41 
      TBP CAG/CAA repeat allele (OR = 4.11, P = 0.21). There was a significant 
      association between the occurrence of a repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) and an increased risk of multiple system atrophy (OR = 1.64, P = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: Occurrence of TBP CAG/CAA repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) is significantly associated with increased multiple system atrophy risk. 
      This discovery warrants further investigation and supports a possible genetic 
      overlap of multiple system atrophy with SCA17.

TI  - Genomic Portrait of a Sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Case in a Large 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 Family.
LID - 10.3390/jpm10040262 [doi]
LID - 262
AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansions in the spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) gene 
      ATXN1 increases the risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), supporting a 
      relationship between these disorders. We recently reported the co-existence, in a 
      large SCA1 family, of a clinically definite ALS individual bearing an 
      intermediate ATXN1 expansion and SCA1 patients with a full expansion, some of 
      which manifested signs of lower motor neuron involvement. METHODS: In this study, 
      we employed a systems biology approach that integrated multiple genomic analyses 
      of the ALS patient and some SCA1 family members. RESULTS: Our analysis identified 
      common and distinctive candidate genes/variants and related biological processes 
      that, in addition to or in combination with ATXN1, may contribute to motor neuron 
      degeneration phenotype. Among these, we distinguished ALS-specific likely 
      pathogenic variants in TAF15 and C9ORF72, two ALS-linked genes involved in the 
      regulation of RNA metabolism, similarly to ATXN1, suggesting a selective role for 
      this pathway in ALS pathogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our work supports the 
      utility to apply personal genomic information for characterizing complex disease 
      phenotypes.

AB  - Increasingly, repeat expansions are being identified as part of the complex 
      genetic architecture of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To date, several repeat 
      expansions have been genetically associated with the disease: intronic repeat 
      expansions in C9orf72, polyglutamine expansions in ATXN2 and polyalanine 
      expansions in NIPA1. Together with previously published data, the identification 
      of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patient with a family history of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, caused by polyglutamine expansions in ATXN1, 
      suggested a similar disease association for the repeat expansion in ATXN1. We, 
      therefore, performed a large-scale international study in 11 700 individuals, in 
      which we showed a significant association between intermediate ATXN1 repeat 
      expansions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (P = 3.33 x 10(-7)). Subsequent 
      functional experiments have shown that ATXN1 reduces the nucleocytoplasmic ratio 
      of TDP-43 and enhances amyotrophic lateral sclerosis phenotypes in Drosophila, 
      further emphasizing the role of polyglutamine repeat expansions in the 
      pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

TI  - Patterns of CAG repeat instability in the central nervous system and periphery in 
      Huntington's disease and in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.
PG  - 2551-2567
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddaa139 [doi]
AB  - The expanded HTT CAG repeat causing Huntington's disease (HD) exhibits somatic 
      expansion proposed to drive the rate of disease onset by eliciting a pathological 
      process that ultimately claims vulnerable cells. To gain insight into somatic 
      expansion in humans, we performed comprehensive quantitative analyses of CAG 
      expansion in ~50 central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral postmortem tissues 
      from seven adult-onset and one juvenile-onset HD individual. We also assessed 
      ATXN1 CAG repeat expansion in brain regions of an individual with a 
      neurologically and pathologically distinct repeat expansion disorder, 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). Our findings reveal similar profiles of 
      tissue instability in all HD individuals, which, notably, were also apparent in 
      the SCA1 individual. CAG expansion was observed in all tissues, but to different 
      degrees, with multiple cortical regions and neostriatum tending to have the 
      greatest instability in the CNS, and liver in the periphery. These patterns 
      indicate different propensities for CAG expansion contributed by disease 
      locus-independent trans-factors and demonstrate that expansion per se is not 
      sufficient to cause cell type or disease-specific pathology. Rather, pathology 
      may reflect distinct toxic processes triggered by different repeat lengths across 
      cell types and diseases. We also find that the HTT CAG length-dependent expansion 
      propensity of an individual is reflected in all tissues and in cerebrospinal 
      fluid. Our data indicate that peripheral cells may be a useful source to measure 
      CAG expansion in biomarker assays for therapeutic efforts, prompting efforts to 
      dissect underlying mechanisms of expansion that may differ between the brain and 
      periphery.

AB  - SAFB1 is a DNA and RNA binding protein that is highly expressed in the cerebellum 
      and hippocampus and is involved in the processing of coding and non-coding RNAs, 
      splicing and dendritic function. We analyzed SAFB1 expression in the post-mortem 
      brain tissue of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), Huntington's disease (HD), Multiple 
      sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease patients and controls. In SCA cases, the 
      expression of SAFB1 in the nucleus was increased and there was abnormal and 
      extensive expression in the cytoplasm where it co-localized with the markers of 
      Purkinje cell injury. Significantly, no SAFB1 expression was found in the 
      cerebellar neurons of the dentate nucleus in control or MS patients; however, in 
      SCA patients, SAFB1 expression was increased significantly in both the nucleus 
      and cytoplasm of dentate neurons. In HD, we found that SAFB1 expression was 
      increased in the nucleus and cytoplasm of striatal neurons; however, there was no 
      SAFB1 staining in the striatal neurons of controls. In PD substantia nigra, we 
      did not see any changes in neuronal SAFB1 expression. iCLIP analysis found that 
      SAFB1 crosslink sites within ATXN1 RNA were adjacent to the start and within the 
      glutamine repeat sequence. Further investigation found increased binding of SAFB1 
      to pathogenic ATXN1-85Q mRNA. These novel data strongly suggest SAFB1 contributes 
      to the etiology of SCA and Huntington's chorea and that it may be a pathological 
      marker of polyglutamine repeat expansion diseases.

TI  - Frequency and distribution of polyQ disease intermediate-length repeat alleles in 
      healthy Italian population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1-2-17 
      (SCA1-2-17) are adult-onset autosomal dominant diseases, caused by triplet repeat 
      expansions in the HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, and TBP genes. Alleles with a repeat number 
      just below the pathological threshold are associated with reduced penetrance and 
      meiotic instability and are defined as intermediate alleles (IAs). OBJECTIVES: We 
      aimed to determine the frequencies of IAs in healthy Italian subjects and to 
      compare the proportion of the IAs with the prevalence of the respective diseases. 
      METHODS: We analyzed the triplet repeat size in HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, and TBP genes 
      in the DNA samples from 729 consecutive adult healthy Italian subjects. RESULTS: 
      IAs associated with reduced penetrance were found in ATXN2 gene (1 subject, 0.1%) 
      and TBP gene (0.82%). IAs at risk for meiotic instability were found in HTT 
      (5.3%) and ATXN2 genes (2.7%). In ATXN1, we found a low percentage of IAs (0.4%). 
      Alleles lacking the common CAT interruption within the CAG sequence were also 
      rare (0.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The high frequencies of IAs in HTT and ATXN2 genes 
      suggest a correlation with the prevalence of the diseases in our population and 
      support the hypothesis that IAs could represent a reservoir of new pathological 
      expansions. On the opposite, ATXN1-IA were very rare in respect to the prevalence 
      of SCA1 in our country, and TBP- IA were more frequent than expected, suggesting 
      that other mechanisms could influence the occurrence of novel pathological 
      expansions.

TI  - Macular degeneration as a common cause of visual loss in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 1 (SCA1) patients.
PG  - 49-53
LID - 10.1080/13816810.2019.1571614 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) caused by pathogenic CAG repeat 
      expansion in the ATXN1 is characterized by loss of vision with little fundus 
      abnormalities in some patients. Recently, macular degeneration has been reported 
      to account for the visual symptoms in sporadic cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five 
      consecutive patients diagnosed as SCA1 with supporting genetical evidence were 
      newly referred to ophthalmology department from neurology unit. They underwent 
      ocular examination to assess visual acuity and the structural integrity of the 
      macula using optical coherent tomography (OCT). Full-field and multifocal 
      electroretinogram (ERG) were recorded in some patients. Genetic testing was done 
      by a polymerase chain reaction-based method. RESULTS: Fundus examinations 
      revealed normal optic disc and macula appearance. However, four out of five 
      patients had foveal thinning by OCT. This included three patients who showed 
      reduced visual acuity. Among the three, multifocal ERG was performed in two, 
      which showed reduced amplitudes in the localized foveal area. Full-field ERG 
      showed normal responses in all five patients assessed. Only one patient had 
      normal visual function and normal macular structure. CONCLUSIONS: Macular 
      degeneration with subtle funduscopic alterations, sometimes mimicking occult 
      macular dystrophy, is an important cause of visual loss in SCA1 patients, which 
      could be reliably detected with OCT and multifocal ERGs.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in ATXN1, characterized by progressive cerebellar and 
      extracerebellar symptoms. MRI-based studies in SCA1 focused in the cerebellum and 
      connections, but there are few data about supratentorial/spinal damage and its 
      clinical relevance. We have thus designed this multimodal MRI study to uncover 
      the structural signature of SCA1. To accomplish that, a group of 33 patients and 
      33 age-and gender-matched healthy controls underwent MRI on a 3T scanner. All 
      patients underwent a comprehensive neurological and neuropsychological 
      evaluation. We correlated the structural findings with the clinical features of 
      the disease. In addition, we evaluated the disease progression looking at 
      differences in SCA1 subgroups defined by disease duration. Ataxia and pyramidal 
      signs were the main symptoms. Neuropsychological evaluation disclosed cognitive 
      impairment in 53% with predominant frontotemporal dysfunction. Gray matter 
      analysis unfolded cortical thinning of primary and associative motor areas with 
      more restricted impairment of deep structures. Deep gray matter atrophy was 
      associated with motor handicap and poor cognition skills. White matter integrity 
      loss was diffuse in the brainstem but restricted in supratentorial structures. 
      Cerebellar cortical thinning was found in multiple areas and correlated not only 
      with motor disability but also with verbal fluency. Spinal cord atrophy 
      correlated with motor handicap. Comparison of MRI findings in disease 
      duration-defined subgroups identified a peculiar pattern of progressive 
      degeneration.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 8 of the ATXN1 gene. We generated 
      induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from a SCA1 patient and his non-affected 
      sister by using non-integrating Sendai Viruses (SeV). The resulting hiPSCs are 
      SeVfree, express pluripotency markers, display a normal karyotype, retain the 
      mutation (length of the CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN1 gene) and are able to 
      differentiate into the three germ layers in vitro.

AB  - Cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansions in the coding regions of nine 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) genes (HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATN1, AR, 
      and TBP) are the cause of several neurodegenerative diseases including 
      Huntington's disease (HD), six different spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. The 
      expanded CAG repeat length in the causative gene is negatively related to the 
      age-at-onset (AAO) of clinical symptoms. In addition to the expanded CAG repeat 
      length in the causative gene, the normal CAG repeats in the other polyQ genes can 
      affect the AAO, suggesting functional interactions between the polyQ genes. 
      However, there is no detailed assessment of the relationships among polyQ genes 
      in pathologically relevant brain regions. We used gene co-expression analysis to 
      study the functional relationships among polyQ genes in different brain regions 
      using the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), a spatial map of gene expression in the 
      healthy brain. We constructed co-expression networks for seven anatomical brain 
      structures, as well as a region showing a specific pattern of atrophy in HD 
      patients detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. In this 
      HD-associated region, we found that ATN1 and ATXN2 were co-expressed and shared 
      co-expression partners which were enriched for DNA repair genes. We observed a 
      similar co-expression pattern in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and striatum in 
      which this relation was most pronounced. Given that the co-expression patterns 
      for these anatomical structures were similar to those for the HD-associated 
      region, our results suggest that their disruption is likely involved in HD 
      pathology. Moreover, ATN1 and ATXN2 also shared many co-expressed genes with HTT, 
      the causative gene of HD, across the brain. Although this triangular relationship 
      among these three polyQ genes may also be dysregulated in other polyQ diseases, 
      stronger co-expression patterns between ATN1 and ATXN2 observed in the 
      HD-associated region, especially in the striatum, may be more specific to HD.

TI  - Postural Tremor and Ataxia Progression in Spinocerebellar Ataxias.
PG  - 492

LID - 492
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postural tremor can sometimes occur in spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs). However, the prevalence and clinical characteristics of postural tremor 
      in SCAs are poorly understood, and whether SCA patients with postural tremor have 
      different ataxia progression is not known. METHODS: We studied postural tremor in 
      315 patients with SCA1, 2, 3, and 6 recruited from the Clinical Research 
      Consortium for Spinocerebellar Ataxias (CRC-SCA), which consists of 12 
      participating centers in the United States, and we evaluated ataxia progression 
      in these patients from January 2010 to August 2012. RESULTS: Among 315 SCA 
      patients, postural tremor was most common in SCA2 patients (SCA1, 5.8%; SCA2, 
      27.5%; SCA3, 12.4%; SCA6, 16.9%; p = 0.007). SCA3 patients with postural tremor 
      had longer CAG repeat expansions than SCA3 patients without postural tremor 
      (73.67 +/- 3.12 vs. 70.42 +/- 3.96, p = 0.003). Interestingly, SCA1 and SCA6 patients 
      with postural tremor had a slower rate of ataxia progression (SCA1, beta = -0.91, p 
      < 0.001; SCA6, beta = -1.28, p = 0.025), while SCA2 patients with postural tremor 
      had a faster rate of ataxia progression (beta = 1.54, p = 0.034). We also found that 
      the presence of postural tremor in SCA2 patients could be influenced by repeat 
      expansions of ATXN1 (beta = -1.53, p = 0.037) and ATXN3 (beta = 0.57, p = 0.018), 
      whereas postural tremor in SCA3 was associated with repeat lengths in TBP (beta = 
      0.63, p = 0.041) and PPP2R2B (beta = -0.40, p = 0.032). DISCUSSION: Postural tremor 
      could be a clinical feature of SCAs, and the presence of postural tremor could be 
      associated with different rates of ataxia progression. Genetic interactions 
      between ataxia genes might influence the brain circuitry and thus affect the 
      clinical presentation of postural tremor.

TI  - A panel study on patients with dominant cerebellar ataxia highlights the 
      frequency of channelopathies.
PG  - 1579-1594
LID - 10.1093/brain/awx081 [doi]
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias have a marked heterogeneous genetic 
      background, with mutations in 34 genes identified so far. This large amount of 
      implicated genes accounts for heterogeneous clinical presentations, making 
      genotype-phenotype correlations a major challenge in the field. While 
      polyglutamine ataxias, linked to CAG repeat expansions in genes such as ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, CACNA1A and TBP, have been extensively characterized in 
      large cohorts, there is a need for comprehensive assessment of frequency and 
      phenotype of more 'conventional' ataxias. After exclusion of CAG/polyglutamine 
      expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia genes in 412 index cases with dominantly 
      inherited cerebellar ataxias, we aimed to establish the relative frequencies of 
      mutations in other genes, with an approach combining panel sequencing and TaqMan(R) 
      polymerase chain reaction assay. We found relevant genetic variants in 59 
      patients (14.3%). The most frequently mutated were channel genes [CACNA1A (n = 
      16), KCND3 (n = 4), KCNC3 (n = 2) and KCNA1 (n = 2)]. Deletions in ITPR1 (n = 11) 
      were followed by biallelic variants in SPG7 (n = 9). Variants in AFG3L2 (n = 7) 
      came next in frequency, and variants were rarely found in STBN2 (n = 2), ELOVL5, 
      FGF14, STUB1 and TTBK2 (n = 1 each). Interestingly, possible risk factor variants 
      were detected in SPG7 and POLG. Clinical comparisons showed that ataxias due to 
      channelopathies had a significantly earlier age at onset with an average of 24.6 
      years, versus 40.9 years for polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias and 
      37.8 years for SPG7-related forms (P = 0.001). In contrast, disease duration was 
      significantly longer in the former (20.5 years versus 9.3 and 13.7, P=0.001), 
      though for similar functional stages, indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. Of interest, intellectual deficiency was more frequent in channel 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, while cognitive impairment in adulthood was similar 
      among the three groups. Similar differences were found among a single gene group, 
      comparing 23 patients with CACNA1A expansions (spinocerebellar ataxia 6) to 22 
      patients with CACNA1A point mutations, which had lower average age at onset (25.2 
      versus 47.3 years) with longer disease duration (18.7 versus 10.9), but lower 
      severity indexes (0.39 versus 0.44), indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. In conclusion, we identified relevant genetic variations in up to 15% of 
      cases after exclusion of polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias, and 
      confirmed CACNA1A and SPG7 as major ataxia genes. We could delineate firm 
      genotype-phenotype correlations that are important for genetic counselling and of 
      possible prognostic value.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias are dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      diseases. As potential treatments for these diseases are being developed, precise 
      knowledge of their natural history is needed. We aimed to study the long-term 
      disease progression of the most common spinocerebellar ataxias: SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, 
      and SCA6. Furthermore, we aimed to establish the order and occurrence of 
      non-ataxia symptoms, and identify predictors of disease progression. METHODS: In 
      this longitudinal cohort study (EUROSCA), we enrolled men and women with positive 
      genetic testing for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 and with progressive, otherwise 
      unexplained ataxia who were aged 18 years or older from 17 ataxia referral 
      centres in ten European countries. Patients were seen every year for 3 years, and 
      at irregular intervals thereafter. The primary outcome was the scale for the 
      assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA), and the inventory of non-ataxia signs 
      (INAS). We used linear mixed models to analyse progression. To account for 
      dropouts, we applied a pattern-mixture model. This study is registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02440763. FINDINGS: Between July 1, 2005, and Aug 
      31, 2006, 526 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 were enrolled. We analysed 
      data for 462 patients with at least one follow-up visit. Median observation time 
      was 49 months (IQR 35-72). SARA progression data were best fitted with a linear 
      model in all genotypes. Annual SARA score increase was 2.11 (SE 0.12) in patients 
      with SCA1, 1.49 (0.07) in patients with SCA2, 1.56 (0.08) in patients with SCA3, 
      and 0.80 (0.09) in patients with SCA6. The increase of the number of non-ataxia 
      signs reached a plateau in SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3. In patients with SCA6, the 
      number of non-ataxia symptoms increased linearly, but more slowly than in 
      patients with SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 (p<0.0001). Factors that were associated with 
      faster progression of the SARA score were short duration of follow-up (p=0.0179), 
      older age at inclusion (0.04 [SE 0.02] per additional year; p=0.0476), and longer 
      repeat expansions (0.06 [SE 0.02] per additional repeat unit; p=0.0128) in SCA1, 
      short duration of follow-up (p<0.0001), lower age at onset (-0.02 [SE 0.01] per 
      additional year; p=0.0014), and lower baseline SARA score (-0.02 [SE 0.01] per 
      additional SARA point; p=0.0083) in SCA2, and lower baseline SARA score (-0.03 
      [SE 0.01] per additional SARA point; p=0.0195) in SCA6. In SCA3, we did not 
      identify factors that affected progression of the SARA score. INTERPRETATION: Our 
      study provides quantitative data on the progression of the most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxias based on a follow-up period that exceeds those of 
      previous studies. Our data could prove useful for sample size calculation and 
      patient stratification in interventional trials. FUNDING: EU FP6 (EUROSCA),

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association of repeat expansion size in 10 common 
      degenerative hereditary ataxia genes with essential tremor. These genes were 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 
      (CACNA1A), SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), 
      SCA-17 (TBP) and dentatorubral-pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA) (ATN1). METHODS: 
      Genetic analysis of repeat size in 10 degenerative hereditary ataxia loci was 
      performed in 323 essential tremor patients and 299 controls enrolled at Columbia 
      University. To test for differences in the allele distribution between patients 
      and controls, a CLUMP analysis was performed. RESULTS: None of the essential 
      tremor patients had a repeat expansion in the intermediate or pathogenic range. 
      Significant differences in the distribution of repeats in the 'normal' range for 
      SCA2 and SCA8 (both p </= 0.02) were observed between essential tremor patients and 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      SCA loci are not associated with essential tremor.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an incurable, dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative disease of the cerebellum caused by a polyglutamine-repeat 
      expansion in the protein ataxin-1 (ATXN1). While analysis of human autopsy 
      material indicates significant glial pathology in SCA1, previous research has 
      focused on characterizing neuronal dysfunction. In this study, we characterized 
      astrocytic and microglial response in SCA1 using a comprehensive array of mouse 
      models. We have discovered that astrocytes and microglia are activated very early 
      in SCA1 pathogenesis even when mutant ATXN1 expression was limited to Purkinje 
      neurons. Glial activation occurred in the absence of neuronal death, suggesting 
      that glial activation results from signals emanating from dysfunctional neurons. 
      Finally, in all different models examined glial activation closely correlated 
      with disease progression, supporting the development of glial-based biomarkers to 
      follow disease progression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a late onset autosomal 
      dominant cerebellar ataxia, caused by CAG triplet repeat expansion in the ATXN1 
      gene. The frequency of SCA1 occurrence is more in Southern India than in other 
      regions as observed from hospital-based studies. However there are no reports on 
      variability of CAG repeat expansion, phenotype-genotype association and founder 
      mutations in a homogenous population from India. METHODS: Genomic DNA isolated 
      from buccal mouthwash of the individuals in the cohort was used for PCR-based 
      diagnosis of SCA1. Subsequently SNP's found within the ATXN1 loci were identified 
      by Taqman allelic discrimination assays. Significance testing of the 
      genotype-phenotype associations was calculated by Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test with 
      post-hoc Dunnett's test and Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: By 
      genetic analysis of an affected population in Southern India we identified 21 
      pre-symptomatic individuals including four that were well past the average age of 
      disease onset of 44 years, 16 symptomatic and 63 normal individuals. All 
      pre-symptomatic cases harbor "pure" expansions of greater than 40 CAGs. 
      Genotyping to test for the presence of two previously identified SNPs showed a 
      founder effect of the same repeat carrying allele as in the general Indian 
      population. We show that SCA1 disease onset is significantly delayed when 
      transmission of the disease is maternal. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of early 
      disease onset in individuals with a paternally inherited allele could serve as 
      valuable information for clinicians towards early detection of SCA1 in patients 
      with affected fathers. Identification of older pre-symptomatic individuals (n = 
      4) in our cohort among individuals with a shared genetic and environmental 
      background, suggests that second site genetic or epigenetic modifiers might 
      significantly affect SCA1 disease progression. Moreover, such undetected SCA1 
      cases could underscore the true prevalence of SCA1 in India.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease of the cerebellum caused by a polyglutamine-repeat expansion in the 
      protein ATXN1. We have previously demonstrated that astrocytic activation occurs 
      early in pathogenesis, correlates with disease progression, and can occur when 
      mutant ATXN1 expression is limited to Purkinje neurons. We now show that 
      expression of glutamate and aspartate transporter, GLAST, is decreased in 
      cerebellar astrocytes in a mouse model of SCA1. This decrease occurs in non-cell 
      autonomous manner late in disease and correlates well with the loss of Purkinje 
      neurons. Astrogliosis or decreased neuronal activity does not correlate with 
      diminished GLAST expression. In addition, Bergmann glia remain capable of 
      transcriptional upregulation of GLAST in response to improvement in Purkinje 
      neurons supporting the notion of active neuron-glia crosstalk in disease.

TI  - Modulation of the age at onset in spinocerebellar ataxia by CAG tracts in various 
      genes.
PG  - 2444-55
LID - 10.1093/brain/awu174 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine-coding (CAG)n repeat expansions in seven different genes cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxias. Although the size of the expansion is negatively 
      correlated with age at onset, it accounts for only 50-70% of its variability. To 
      find other factors involved in this variability, we performed a regression 
      analysis in 1255 affected individuals with identified expansions (spinocerebellar 
      ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7), recruited through the European Consortium on 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxias, to determine whether age at onset is influenced by the 
      size of the normal allele in eight causal (CAG)n-containing genes (ATXN1-3, 6-7, 
      17, ATN1 and HTT). We confirmed the negative effect of the expanded allele and 
      detected threshold effects reflected by a quadratic association between age at 
      onset and CAG size in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 3 and 6. We also evidenced 
      an interaction between the expanded and normal alleles in trans in individuals 
      with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 6 and 7. Except for individuals with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, age at onset was also influenced by other 
      (CAG)n-containing genes: ATXN7 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2; ATXN2, ATN1 and 
      HTT in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3; ATXN1 and ATXN3 in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 6; and ATXN3 and TBP in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7. This suggests that 
      there are biological relationships among these genes. The results were partially 
      replicated in four independent populations representing 460 Caucasians and 216 
      Asian samples; the differences are possibly explained by ethnic or geographical 
      differences. As the variability in age at onset is not completely explained by 
      the effects of the causative and modifier sister genes, other genetic or 
      environmental factors must also play a role in these diseases.

TI  - The histone deacetylase HDAC3 is essential for Purkinje cell function, 
      potentially complicating the use of HDAC inhibitors in SCA1.
PG  - 3733-45

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a pathogenic glutamine repeat expansion in the protein ataxin-1 
      (ATXN1). One likely mechanism mediating pathogenesis is excessive transcriptional 
      repression induced by the expanded ATXN-1. Because ATXN1 binds HDAC3, a Class I 
      histone deacetylase (HDAC) that we have found to be required for ATXN1-induced 
      transcriptional repression, we tested whether genetically depleting HDAC3 
      improves the phenotype of the SCA1 knock-in mouse (SCA1(154Q/2Q)), the most 
      physiologically relevant model of SCA1. Given that HDAC3 null mice are embryonic 
      lethal, we used for our analyses a combination of HDAC3 haploinsufficient and 
      Purkinje cell (PC)-specific HDAC3 null mice. Although deleting a single allele of 
      HDAC3 in the context of SCA1 was insufficient to improve cerebellar and cognitive 
      deficits of the disease, a complete loss of PC HDAC3 was highly deleterious both 
      behaviorally, with mice showing early onset ataxia, and pathologically, with 
      progressive histologic evidence of degeneration. Inhibition of HDAC3 may yet have 
      a role in SCA1 therapy, but our study provides cautionary evidence that this 
      approach could produce untoward effects. Indeed, the neurotoxic consequences of 
      HDAC3 depletion could prove relevant, wherever pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC3 
      is being contemplated, in disorders ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by polyglutamine repeat expansions in Ataxin-1. Recent evidence 
      supports a role for microRNAs (miRNAs) deregulation in SCA1 pathogenesis. 
      However, the extent to which miRNAs may modulate the onset, progression or 
      severity of SCA1 remains largely unknown. In this study, we used a mouse model of 
      SCA1 to determine if miRNAs are misregulated in pre- and post-symptomatic SCA1 
      cerebellum. We found a significant alteration in the steady-state levels of 
      numerous miRNAs prior to and following phenotypic onset. In addition, we provide 
      evidence that increased miR-150 levels in SCA1 Purkinje neurons may modulate 
      disease pathogenesis by targeting the expression of Rgs8 and Vegfa.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease that results from a pathogenic glutamine-repeat expansion in the protein 
      ataxin-1 (ATXN1). Although the functions of ATXN1 are still largely unknown, 
      there is evidence to suggest that ATXN1 plays a role in regulating gene 
      expression, the earliest process known to go awry in SCA1 mouse models. In this 
      study, we show that ATXN1 reduces histone acetylation, a post-translational 
      modification of histones associated with enhanced transcription, and represses 
      histone acetyl transferase-mediated transcription. In addition, we find that 
      depleting the Leucine-rich Acidic Nuclear Protein (LANP)-an ATXN1 binding 
      inhibitor of histone acetylation-reverses aspects of SCA1 neuritic pathology.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias: an example of the challenges associated with genetic 
      databases for dynamic mutations.
PG  - 1359-65
LID - 10.1002/humu.22156 [doi]
AB  - Locus-specific databases are an important source of information for diagnostic 
      laboratories and a valued means of improving quality of genetic testing. Although 
      increasingly frequent, databases for oligonucleotide repeat expansions are still 
      scarce, due to factors that make them different and the building of databases 
      much more difficult. Definition of what constitutes "the repeat" to measure is 
      not a simple matter and correct sizing is not always straightforward. Reference 
      ranges and penetrance classes are not easy to establish. Acceptable margins of 
      error depend on the disease and allele-size distribution, and vary according to 
      size range and pathogenic significance. Inter- and intralaboratorial variance is 
      well documented and allele distribution may vary among populations. The 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, used only as an example of those difficulties, are also 
      a highly heterogeneous group, which includes loci with both pathogenic repeat 
      expansions and point mutations or insertions/deletions. They display a variable, 
      but often overlapping phenotype, where genotype-phenotype correlation is 
      difficult or nonexistent. Standard (Human Genome Variation Society) nomenclature 
      is not appropriate for oligonucleotide repeats, as established at harmonization 
      among all EMQN (European Molecular Genetics Network) external quality assessment 
      (EQA) schemes for "repeat disorders." Curation of such databases is a difficult 
      task, but one that needs to be addressed adequately and without much delay.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias are autosomal dominant diseases, associated in some types 
      with a CAG repeat expansion, and characterised by a progressive loss of motor 
      function. Currently, as there is no cure for most ataxias, treatment 
      predominantly involves physical therapy. Various symptomatic drug treatments have 
      been tried; however, published clinical studies have provided inconsistent 
      results, likely due to small sample sizes, mixed patient populations and 
      insensitive or subjective assessment scales. SCA1(154Q) transgenic mice display 
      motor function impairments and ultimately a reduced number of cerebellar Purkinje 
      neurons-characteristics comparable to most forms of sporadic and hereditary 
      ataxias. We monitored motor function in SCA1(154Q) mice from 5 to 20 weeks of age 
      and assessed the efficacy of four potential cerebellar modulatory drugs in 
      attenuating deficits in rotor-rod performance. The drugs riluzole, amantadine, 
      zolpidem and buspirone were selected based on their different mechanisms of 
      action and their Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/Australian Therapeutic Goods 
      Administration approval for other indications. SCA1(154Q) and C57/Bl6 wild-type 
      mice were administered with four ascending acute doses of each drug, over 2 days. 
      Following each dose, mice were assesed for motor function on the accelerating 
      rotor-rod. None of the four drugs attenuated motor deficts in SCA1(154Q) mice at 
      any dose; at FDA equivalent and higher dose administration of zolpidem and 
      buspirone led to sedation in both strains. Our results suggest that the 
      aforementioned drugs are likely to be ineffective for symptomatic treatment of 
      SCA1 and most other ataxic patients and emphasise the need for comphrehensive 
      drug studies prior to clinical use.

AB  - To date there are 9 known diseases caused by an expanded polyglutamine repeat, 
      with the most prevalent being Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease is a 
      progressive autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder for which currently no 
      therapy is available. It is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene, 
      which results in an expansion of a glutamine stretch at the N-terminal end of the 
      huntingtin protein. This polyglutamine expansion plays a central role in the 
      disease and results in the accumulation of cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates. 
      Here, we make use of modified 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate (CUG)n triplet-repeat 
      antisense oligonucleotides to effectively reduce mutant huntingtin transcript and 
      protein levels in patient-derived Huntington's disease fibroblasts and 
      lymphoblasts. The most effective antisense oligonucleotide, (CUG)(7), also 
      reduced mutant ataxin-1 and ataxin-3 mRNA levels in spinocerebellar ataxia 1 and 
      3, respectively, and atrophin-1 in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy patient 
      derived fibroblasts. This antisense oligonucleotide is not only a promising 
      therapeutic tool to reduce mutant huntingtin levels in Huntington's disease but 
      our results in spinocerebellar ataxia and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      cells suggest that this could also be applicable to other polyglutamine expansion 
      disorders as well.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Given the recent finding of an association between intermediate-length 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) expansions in ataxin 2 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (ALS), we sought to determine whether expansions in other polyQ disease genes 
      were associated with ALS. METHODS: We assessed the polyQ lengths of ataxin 1, 
      ataxin 3, ataxin 6, ataxin 7, TBP, atrophin 1, and huntingtin in several hundred 
      patients with sporadic ALS and healthy controls. RESULTS: Other than ataxin 2, we 
      did not identify a significant association with the other polyQ genes and ALS. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the effects of ataxin 2 polyQ expansions on 
      ALS risk are likely to be rooted in the biology of ataxin 2 or ataxin 2-specific 
      interactions, rather than the presence of an expanded polyQ repeat per se. These 
      findings have important consequences for understanding the role of ataxin 2 in 
      ALS pathogenesis and provide a framework for future mechanistic studies.

PG  - 101-5
LID - 10.1007/s12311-008-0023-2 [doi]
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of autosomal 
      dominantly inherited progressive ataxia diseases. Up to now, almost 30 different 
      gene loci have been found. In 14 of them, the underlying mutations have been 
      identified. The more common SCAs, SCA1, 2, 3 and 6 are due to translated CAG 
      repeat expansions that code for an elongated polyglutamine tract within the 
      respective proteins. These diseases belong to a larger group of polyglutamine 
      disorders that also includes Huntington's disease. Epidemiological studies 
      conducted in different European regions found prevalence rates of SCAs ranging 
      from 0.9 to 3.0:100,000. In all SCAs, ataxia is the prominent symptom. However, 
      the majority have a complex phenotype in which ataxia is accompanied by varying 
      non-ataxia symptoms. In all ataxia patients with proven or suspected autosomal 
      dominant mode of inheritance, the available molecular genetic tests for SCA 
      mutations should be performed. Depending on the geographical origin of the 
      family, these tests will lead to positive diagnostic results in at least half of 
      the families.

TI  - Case control analysis of repeat expansion size in ataxia.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurological diseases. The expansion of unstable microsatellite 
      repeats has been identified as the underlying pathogenic cause of 10 subtypes of 
      autosomal dominant SCAs. The aetiology of sporadic SCA is unknown. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effect of large normal repeats in patients 
      presenting with sporadic or familial ataxia compared to a control population. The 
      size of the expansion was determined using a fluorescent PCR approach in 10 
      common SCA genes: SCA-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 (CACNA1A), 
      SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), SCA-17 (TBP) 
      and DRPLA (ATN1), in 165 ataxia patients and 307 controls of Welsh origin. There 
      was no difference between cases and controls in the distribution of the large 
      normal alleles, or in the distribution of the combined CAG repeats. The normal 
      allele distribution in the Welsh population was largely similar to that of other 
      Caucasian populations. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of large normal 
      repeats on the susceptibility to develop ataxia.

TI  - Multiplex families with multiple system atrophy.
PG  - 545-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) has been considered a sporadic disease, 
      without patterns of inheritance. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of 
      4 multiplex families with MSA, including clinical genetic aspects. DESIGN: 
      Clinical and genetic study. SETTING: Four departments of neurology in Japan. 
      Patients Eight patients in 4 families with parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and 
      autonomic failure with age at onset ranging from 58 to 72 years. Two siblings in 
      each family were affected with these conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical 
      evaluation was performed according to criteria by Gilman et al. Trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the responsible genes for the spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 
      series and for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) was evaluated by 
      polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequence analysis of coding regions in the 
      alpha-synuclein gene was performed. RESULTS: Consanguineous marriage was observed 
      in 1 of 4 families. Among 8 patients, 1 had definite MSA, 5 had probable MSA, and 
      2 had possible MSA. The most frequent phenotype was MSA with predominant 
      parkinsonism, observed in 5 patients. Six patients showed pontine atrophy with 
      cross sign or slitlike signal change at the posterolateral putaminal margin or 
      both on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Possibilities of hereditary ataxias, 
      including SCA1 (ataxin 1, ATXN1), SCA2 (ATXN2), Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3 
      (ATXN1), SCA6 (ATXN1), SCA7 (ATXN7), SCA12 (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory 
      subunit B, beta isoform; PP2R2B), SCA17 (TATA box binding protein, TBP) and DRPLA 
      (atrophin 1; ATN1), were excluded, and no mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene 
      were found. CONCLUSIONS: Findings in these multiplex families suggest the 
      presence of familial MSA with autosomal recessive inheritance and a genetic 
      predisposition to MSA. Molecular genetic approaches focusing on familial MSA are 
      expected to provide clues to the pathogenesis of MSA.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat dynamic mutation identifying susceptibility in familial and 
      sporadic chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.
PG  - 73-9
AB  - Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) has a strong hereditary component, but an 
      understanding of predisposition genes is poor. Anticipation with familial CLL has 
      been reported, although the molecular mechanism is unknown. Expansion of 
      trinucleotide repeat sequences underlies anticipation observed in 
      neurodegenerative disease. A polymerase chain reaction-based assay was used to 
      analyse the stability of ten CCG- and CAG-trinucleotide repeat tracts in 18 CLL 
      families and 140 patients with the sporadic form of the disease. The study 
      suggests that anticipation, if it occurs in CLL, is not linked to CCG- and 
      CAG-repeat expansion, however, variation in repeat length at certain loci 
      (FRA16A) may permit identification of susceptible family members. In addition, 
      polymorphisms with prognostic significance were identified. These were high 
      length (but not expanded) repeats at FRA11B (P = 0.01), ATXN1 (P = 0.032) and 
      ATXN3 (P = 0.022), all associated with poor risk disease.

TI  - Comparative genetics of functional trinucleotide tandem repeats in humans and 
      apes.
PG  - 329-39
AB  - Several human neurodegenerative disorders are caused by the expansion of 
      polymorphic trinucleotide repeat regions. Many of these loci are functional short 
      tandem repeats (STRs) located in brain-expressed genes, and their study is thus 
      relevant from both a medical and an evolutionary point of view. The aims of our 
      study are to infer the comparative pattern of variation and evolution of this set 
      of loci in order to show species-specific features in this group of STRs and on 
      their potential for expansion (therefore, an insight into evolutionary medicine) 
      and to unravel whether any human-specific feature may be identified in 
      brain-expressed genes involved in human disease. We analyzed the variability of 
      the normal range of seven expanding STR CAG/CTG loci (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3-MJD, SCA6, 
      SCA8, SCA12, and DRPLA) and two nonexpanding polymorphic CAG loci (KCNN3 and 
      NCOA3) in humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. The study showed a 
      general conservation of the repetitive tract and of the polymorphism in the four 
      species and high heterogeneity among loci distributions. Humans present slightly 
      larger alleles than the rest of species but a more relevant difference appears in 
      variability levels: Humans are the species with the largest variance, although 
      only for the expanding loci, suggesting a relationship between variability levels 
      and expansion potential. The sequence analysis shows high levels of sequence 
      conservation among species, a lack of correspondence between interruption 
      patterns and variability levels, and signs of conservative selective pressure for 
      some of the STR loci. Only two loci (SCA1 and SCA8) show a human specific 
      distribution, with larger alleles than the rest of species. This could account, 
      at the same time, for a human-specific trait and a predisposition to disease 
      through expansion.

TI  - Patterns of CAG repeat interruptions in SCA1 and SCA2 genes in relation to repeat 
      instability.
PG  - 236-47
AB  - About 3% of the human genome is composed of simple sequence repeats and many of 
      these sequences occur within genes. These repeats are often polymorphic in a 
      normal population and their expansion in specific genes leads to a number of 
      hereditary neurological diseases. Normal variants of disease-related genes 
      contain either pure or interrupted repeats, and the postulated function of the 
      interruptions is to prevent repeat expansions. Their structural role in the 
      repeat tracts of genes and transcripts awaits detailed characterization. In this 
      study, we have determined the SCA1 and SCA2 genotypes in a Polish population and 
      found significant differences in allele spectra and frequencies from those 
      reported for other populations. They are discussed in relation to the repeat 
      expansion mechanism and disease incidence. We postulate that the dynamic mutation 
      of the genes SCA1 (also ATX1 or ataxin 1) and SCA2 (also ATX2 or ataxin 2) may 
      begin from the expansion of long pure repeat tracts without the prior loss of 
      interruptions. A simple way of cost-effective allelotyping of CAG repeat regions 
      in the SCA1 and SCA2genes is also shown. The reliable SSCP/duplex analysis 
      presented here may be the method of choice for the systematic searching of genes 
      for known and novel interrupted repeats.

TI  - No association of the SCA1 (CAG)31 allele with Huntington's disease, myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1 and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.
PG  - 61-3
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansions are the underlying mutation in several 
      neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders including at least eight 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA). The molecular mechanisms of repeat expansion are 
      as yet insufficiently understood. Recently, an association of the SCA1 (CAG)31 
      repeat allele with Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy type 1 was 
      described. These findings implicate a possible role of the SCA1 (CAG)31 allele in 
      other triplet diseases. We analyzed the SCA1 CAG repeat length in a large sample 
      of Huntington's disease (n=182), myotonic dystrophy type 1 (n=64) and SCA3 (n=31) 
      patients. In none of these groups was a significant association with the 31 
      repeat allele found. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that this allele 
      is involved in the etiology of trinucleotide expansion.

TI  - Molecular genetics of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia: mutation analysis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia genes and CAG/CTG repeat expansion detection in 225 
      Italian families.
PG  - 727-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, at present 
      associated with 22 loci (spinocerebellar ataxia [SCA] 1-SCA8, SCA10-SCA19, SCA21, 
      SCA22, fibroblast growth factor 14 [FGF14]-SCA, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy [DRPLA]). The relevant gene has been identified in 12 cases (SCA1-3, 
      SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, FGF14, and DRPLA), and in all but the recently identified 
      SCA14, SCA17, PRKCG and FGF14 genes, the defect consists of the expansion of a 
      short nucleotide repeat. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relative prevalence of 
      SCA1-3, SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, and SCA17 gene expansions in Italian families with 
      hereditary ataxia, specifically to verify the occurrence of SCA10, SCA12, and 
      SCA17 in Italy; and to analyze samples from probands with negative test results 
      at the initial screening by means of the repeat expansion detection technique to 
      identify CAG/CTG expansions in novel loci.Patients Two hundred twenty-five 
      unrelated Italian index cases with hereditary ataxia, most (n = 183) of whom 
      presented with a clear dominantly transmitted trait. RESULTS: We found that SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene mutations accounted for most cases (21% and 24%, respectively). We 
      found SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, and SCA17 to be very rare (approximately 1% each), 
      and no case of SCA10 or SCA12 was identified. Half of the index cases (113/225) 
      were negative for expansions in the known SCA genes. Repeat expansion detection 
      analysis performed on 111 of these cases showed a CAG/CTG repeat expansion of at 
      least 50 triplets in 22 (20%). Twenty-one of 22 expansions could be attributed to 
      length variation at 2 polymorphic loci (expanded repeat domain CAG/CTG 1 [ERDA1] 
      or CTG repeat on chromosome 18q21.1 [CTG18.1]). In 1 patient, the expansion was 
      assigned to the DRPLA gene. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of SCA1-3 and SCA6-7 
      gene mutations is peculiar in Italy. We found a relatively high frequency of SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene expansions; SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 mutations were rare, compared with 
      other European countries. No SCA10 or SCA12 and only a few SCA8 (2/225) and SCA17 
      (2/225) families were detected. In patients negative for defects in known SCA 
      genes, repeat expansion detection data strongly suggest that, at least in our 
      population, CAG/CTG expansions in novel genes should be considered an unlikely 
      cause of the SCA phenotype.

TI  - Analysis of trinucleotide repeats in different SCA loci in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      patients and in normal population of Taiwan.
PG  - 355-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) patients referred to our research 
      center, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD (Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, SCA8 and SCA12 
      loci were assessed for expansion of trinucleotide repeats. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      A total of 211 ADCA patients, including 202 patients with dominantly inherited 
      ataxia from 81 Taiwanese families and nine patients with sporadic ataxia, were 
      included in this study and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. 
      The amplified products of all loci were analyzed on both 3% agarose gels and 6% 
      denaturing urea-polyacrylamide gels. PCR-based Southern blots were also applied 
      for the detection of SCA7 locus. RESULTS: The SCA1 mutation was detected in six 
      affected individuals from one family (1.2%) with expanded alleles of 50-53 CAG 
      repeats. Fourteen individuals from nine families (11%) had a CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while affected SCA2 alleles have 34-49 CAG 
      repeats. The SCA3/MJD CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in 60 affected 
      individuals from 26 families (32%) was expanded to 71-85 CAG repeats. As for the 
      SCA7 locus, there were two affected individuals from one family (1.2%) possessed 
      41 and 100 CAG repeats, respectively. However, we did not detect expansion in the 
      SCA6, SCA8 and SCA12 loci in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The SCA3/MJD CAG expansion 
      was the most frequent mutation among the SCA patients. The relative prevalence of 
      SCA3/MJD in Taiwan was higher than that of SCA2, SCA1 and SCA7.

TI  - Slipped (CTG).(CAG) repeats of the myotonic dystrophy locus: surface probing with 
      anti-DNA antibodies.
PG  - 585-600
AB  - At least 15 human diseases have been associated with the length-dependent 
      expansion of gene-specific (CTG).(CAG) repeats, including myotonic dystrophy 
      (DM1) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). Repeat expansion is likely to 
      involve unusual DNA structures. We have structurally characterized such DNA, with 
      (CTG)(n).(CAG)(n) repeats of varying length (n=17-79), by high-resolution gel 
      electrophoresis, and have probed their surfaces with anti-DNA antibodies of known 
      specificities. We prepared homoduplex S-DNAs, which are (CTG)x.(CAG)y where x=y, 
      and heteroduplex SI-DNAs, which are hybrids where x>y or x<y. S-DNAs formed many 
      different species of slipped isomers, as indicated by its multiple 
      electrophoretic species. In contrast, SI-DNAs formed distinct structures, as 
      indicated by the limited electrophoretic species for all possible repeat length 
      pairings. Sister SI-DNAs with an excess of CAG repeats always migrated slower 
      than their sister SI-DNAs with an excess of CTG repeats. Strikingly, both the 
      propensity to form slipped structures and the pattern of S-DNAs, but not SI-DNAs, 
      varied for similar lengths of CTG/CAG repeats between the DM1 and SCA1 loci, 
      highlighting a role for flanking cis-elements in S-DNA but not SI-DNA formation. 
      Slipped structures bound structure and nucleotide-specific anti-DNA antibodies. 
      Binding of anti-B-DNA antibodies was reduced for both S-DNAs and SI-DNAs relative 
      to their linear forms. SI-DNAs bound anti-Z-DNA antibodies, while both S and 
      SI-DNAs bound anti-cruciform antibodies, revealing shared characteristics between 
      the corresponding DNA structures and slipped DNAs. Such features of the repeats 
      may be recognized by cellular proteins known to bind such structures.

TI  - Interaction of Akt-phosphorylated ataxin-1 with 14-3-3 mediates neurodegeneration 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.
PG  - 457-68
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is one of several neurological disorders 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion. In SCA1, this expansion produces an abnormally 
      long polyglutamine tract in the protein ataxin-1. Mutant polyglutamine proteins 
      accumulate in neurons, inducing neurodegeneration, but the mechanism underlying 
      this accumulation has been unclear. We have discovered that the 14-3-3 protein, a 
      multifunctional regulatory molecule, mediates the neurotoxicity of ataxin-1 by 
      binding to and stabilizing ataxin-1, thereby slowing its normal degradation. The 
      association of ataxin-1 with 14-3-3 is regulated by Akt phosphorylation, and in a 
      Drosophila model of SCA1, both 14-3-3 and Akt modulate neurodegeneration. Our 
      finding that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling and 14-3-3 cooperate to 
      modulate the neurotoxicity of ataxin-1 provides insight into SCA1 pathogenesis 
      and identifies potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1): phenotype-genotype correlation studies in 
      intermediate alleles.
PG  - 204-9
AB  - CAG repeat expansions with loss of CAT interruptions in the coding region of the 
      ataxin-1 gene are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). For 
      molecular genetic diagnosis it is necessary to define the limits of normal and 
      pathological size ranges. In most studies, normal alleles as measured by PCR 
      range from 6-39 units with interruptions of 1-3 CAT trinucleotides that are 
      thought to be involved in the stability of the trinucleotide stretch during DNA 
      replication. Expanded alleles have been reported to carry 39-81 CAG 
      trinucleotides without stabilising CAT interruptions. To evaluate the limits 
      between normal and disease size ranges we analysed the repeat length and 
      composition of the SCA1 gene in 15 individuals with alleles ranging from 36 and 
      41 triplets for genotype-phenotype correlation studies. We found the 39 
      trinucleotide-allele to be either interrupted by CAT repeats or formed by a pure 
      CAG stretch. The clinical features of individuals carrying 39 uninterrupted CAG 
      repeats did not differ from the SCA1 phenotype in general with dysphagia, pale 
      discs, pyramidal signs and cerebellar tremor being more frequent as compared to 
      other SCA genotypes. In contrast, the interrupted 39 trinucleotide-allele is not 
      correlated with the SCA1 phenotype.

TI  - Is the 31 CAG repeat allele of the spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) gene locus 
      non-specifically associated with trinucleotide expansion diseases?
PG  - 201-5
AB  - A number of human hereditary neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders are 
      caused by the expansion of trinucleotide repeats within certain genes. The 
      molecular mechanisms that underlie these expansions are not yet known. We have 
      analyzed six trinucleotide repeat-containing loci [spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, 
      SCA3, SCA8), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), Huntington chorea (HD) 
      and fragile X syndrome (FRAXA)] in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients (n = 
      52). As controls, we analyzed two groups of subjects: healthy control subjects (n 
      =133), and a group of patients with non-triplet neuromuscular diseases (n = 68) 
      caused by point mutations, deletions or duplications (spinal muscular atrophy, 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 1A, hereditary neuropathy with liability to 
      pressure palsies, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy). Allele frequency 
      distributions for all tested loci were similar in these three groups with the 
      exception of the SCA1 locus. In DM1 patients, the SCA1 allele with 31 CAG repeats 
      account for 40.4% of all chromosomes tested, which is significantly higher than 
      in two other groups (11.3% in healthy controls and 6.6% in the group of 
      non-triplet diseased patients; P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). This is 
      consistent with our previous findings in HD patients. The absence of this 
      association in non-triplet diseases as well as in healthy controls could indicate 
      a possible role of this SCA1 allele with 31 repeats in triplet diseases. Here we 
      discuss a possible role of the SCA1 region in pathological trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions.

TI  - Molecular analysis of Spinocerebellar ataxias in Koreans: frequencies and 
      reference ranges of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7.
PG  - 336-41
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. CAG repeat expansions in the causative genes have been identified as 
      the basic cause of several types of SCAs, and have been used for the diagnoses 
      and classifications of patients with ataxia. In order to assess the frequency and 
      CAG repeat size ranges of SCAs, and to establish an effective strategy for 
      molecular diagnosis, we performed a molecular analysis of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      and SCA7 in 76 patients. These patients were as follows: 32 with dominant 
      inheritance, 39 sporadic cases, and 5 with unknown family histories. The normal 
      and affected CAG repeat size ranges were established at five SCA loci in Koreans, 
      which was consistent with previous reports. The total prevalence of the five 
      types of SCAs was 39.5% in the 76 patients with ataxia, regardless of their 
      family history. It was 75.0% in the 32 families with a dominant inheritance. The 
      most frequent type was SCA3 (15.8%), followed by SCA2 (14.5%). Both types 
      combined formed 76.7% of the 30 patients with CAG expansions. SCA1, SCA6, and 
      SCA7 were less frequent, affecting 3.9%, 2.6%, and 2.6% of the cases, 
      respectively. This mutation spectrum is quite different from a previous report 
      concerning Koreans, but is similar to the distributions that are seen in several 
      ethnic populations worldwide. For a correct and effective diagnosis of SCAs, we 
      suggest that a molecular diagnosis be undertaken, even in patients without a 
      family history, as well as those with a family history. A stepwise approach is 
      also recommended. Patients with ataxia should be tested for SCA2 and SCA3. 
      Individuals testing negative should be tested for SCA1, SCA6, and SCA7.

TI  - Ophthalmological findings in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 are not 
      correlated with neurological anticipation.
PG  - 722-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Optic atrophy, attenuation of the oscillatory potentials (OPs) of the 
      electroretinogram (ERG), and enlargement of corneal endothelial cells, have been 
      reported in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). These patients 
      have a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the SCA1 gene and show neurological 
      anticipation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the 
      ophthalmological findings are correlated with the neurological disorders, and 
      whether ophthalmological anticipation is present in patients with SCA1. METHODS: 
      The visual acuity, ERGs, and corneal endothelial cell density were examined in 14 
      patients whose DNA analysis revealed an expanded trinucleotide repeat in an 
      allele of the SCA1 gene. The results of the tests were compared with the 
      trinucleotide repeat number and the duration of the neuronal disease. RESULTS: 
      The neurological disorders in the patients showed anticipation. The negative 
      correlation between the trinucleotide repeat number and the neurological disorder 
      was statistically significant (P<0.0001). However, the correlations between 
      trinucleotide repeat number and visual acuity, amplitude of OPs, and corneal 
      endothelial cell density were not significant. Statistically significant 
      correlations were found between the duration of the neuronal disease and the 
      visual acuity, OPs, and corneal endothelial cell density (P<0.0001, P=0.0004, and 
      P<0.0001, respectively). The ophthalmological disorders were prominent in 
      patients who had neuronal disease for more than 10 years. CONCLUSION: Unlike the 
      neurological findings, the ophthalmological disorders in patients with SCA1 were 
      not correlated with the trinucleotide repeat number of the SCA1 gene. The 
      ophthalmological findings were most highly correlated with the duration of the 
      neuronal disease.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 in China: molecular analysis and genotype-phenotype 
      correlation in 5 families.
PG  - 789-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Twelve genetic types of autosomal dominant hereditary ataxia have 
      been recently identified and the genes responsible for most of them cloned. 
      Molecular identification of the type of ataxia is important to determine the 
      disease prevalence and its natural history in various populations. OBJECTIVES: To 
      perform molecular analysis of 75 Chinese families affected with spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) and to evaluate the spectrum of mutations in these genes and the 
      correlation between genotypes and phenotypes in Chinese patients. SETTING: 
      Neurogenetics Unit, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China. METHODS: One 
      hundred nine patients from 75 kindreds diagnosed as having autosomal dominant 
      SCA, 16 patients with sporadic SCA or spastic paraplegia, 280 control chromosomes 
      of the Chinese population, and 120 control chromosomes of the Sakha population 
      were selected for this study. We conducted detailed mutational analysis by direct 
      sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products amplified from genomic DNA. 
      RESULTS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) was identified in 5 families with 
      12 studied patients. All affected family members were heterozygous for a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the SCA1 gene containing 51 to 64 trinucleotide repeats. 
      Normal alleles had 26 to 35 repeats. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 accounted for 
      7% of the studied Chinese families with ataxia. In addition, we determined the 
      frequency of a single vs double CAT interruption in 120 control chromosomes of 
      the Siberian Sakha population, which has the highest known prevalence of SCA1, 
      and compared this with 280 control chromosomes from the Chinese populations. The 
      results show that 64.7% of the Siberian normal alleles contain a single CAT 
      interruption, whereas 92% of the Chinese had more than 1 interruption. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 is responsible for 7% of affected 
      families in the Chinese population. A correlation between the prevalence of SCA1 
      and the number of CAT interruptions in the trinucleotide chain suggests that a 
      CAT-to-CAG substitution may have been the initial event contributing to the 
      generation of expanded alleles and influencing relative prevalence of SCA1.

TI  - Analysis of CAG repeats in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia patients and distribution of CAG repeats at the SCA1, SCA2 
      and SCA6 loci in nine ethnic populations of eastern India.
PG  - 597-604
AB  - To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 57 unrelated 
      individuals clinically diagnosed as ataxia patients we analysed the SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci for expansion of CAG repeats. We detected CAG 
      repeat expansion in 6 patients (10.5%) at the SCA1 locus. Ten of the 57 patients 
      (17.5%) had CAG repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while four had CAG expansion 
      at the SCA3/MJD locus (7%). At the SCA6 locus there was a single patient (1.8%) 
      with 21 CAG repeats. We have not detected any patient with expansion in the SCA7 
      and DRPLA loci. To test whether the frequencies of the large normal alleles in 
      SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6 loci can reflect some light on prevalence of the subtypes of 
      SCAs we studied the CAG repeat variation in these loci in nine ethnic 
      sub-populations of eastern India from which the patients originated. We report 
      here that the frequency of large normal alleles (>31 CAG repeats) in SCA1 locus 
      to be 0.211 of 394 chromosomes studied. We also report that the frequency of 
      large normal alleles (>22 CAG repeats) at the SCA2 locus is 0.038 while at the 
      SCA6 locus frequency of large normal alleles (>13 repeats) is 0.032. We discussed 
      our data in light of the distribution of normal alleles and prevalence of SCAs in 
      the Japanese and white populations.

TI  - Frequency of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, and DRPLA CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in patients with hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia from Chinese 
      kindreds.
PG  - 540-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of SCA1 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 1), SCA2, 
      SCA3/MJD (spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, and 
      DRPLA (dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy) CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions 
      [(CAG)n] among persons diagnosed with hereditary SCA from Chinese families. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, 
      and DRPLA (CAG)n mutation were detected with the polymerase chain reaction, 
      highly denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and silver staining 
      technique in 167 patients with autosomal dominant SCA from 85 Chinese families 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA. RESULTS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (CAG)n 
      mutation in 7 patients from 4 kindreds (4.70%) was expanded to 53 to 62 repeats. 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (CAG)n mutation in 12 patients from 5 kindreds 
      (5.88%) was expanded to 42 to 47 repeats. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3/Machado-Joseph disease (CAG)n mutation in 83 patients from 41 kindreds (48.23%) 
      was expanded to 68 to 83 repeats. Sixty-five patients from 35 kindreds (41.19%) 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA did not test positive for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, 
      SCA6, SCA7, or DRPLA. There was a predictable inverse relationship between the 
      number of CAG repeats and the age at onset for SCA3/MJD and SCA2. Clinically, 
      dementia and hyporeflexia were more frequent in patients with SCA2, while 
      spasticity, hyperreflexia, and Babinski signs were more frequent in patients with 
      SCA3/ MJD, and those might be helpful in clinical work to primarily distinguish 
      patients with SCA3/MJD and SCA2 from others with different types of SCA. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of SCA3/MJD is substantially higher than that of SCA1 
      and SCA2 in patients with autosomal dominant SCA from Chinese kindreds, who are 
      non-Portuguese. Clinical expressions of the various types of SCAs overlap one 
      another; therefore, for clinical study it is important to make a gene diagnosis 
      and genetic classification for patients with SCA.

TI  - Disassembly of nuclear inclusions in the dividing cell--a novel insight into 
      neurodegeneration.
PG  - 2451-9
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias and Huntington's disease are examples of 
      neurodegenerative diseases caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion. One 
      hallmark of such diseases is the formation of inclusion bodies (IBs) within 
      neuronal tissue. Although these inclusions may play a pivotal role in the disease 
      process, the reasons underlying their specific accumulation remain obscure. By 
      studying intranuclear IBs in dividing cells we demonstrate for the first time 
      that inclusions such as those of ataxin-1 disperse during mitosis, thus reducing 
      the nuclear aggregate burden. IBs reform in the interphase nucleus. By 
      high-resolution confocal microscopy we also show that inclusions comprise ordered 
      structures capable of homotypic interactions. Unlike those of a non-pathologic 
      protein, ataxin-1 inclusions were shown to be capable of non-specific protein 
      sequestration. Our studies indicate that the specific accumulation of inclusions 
      in terminally differentiated cells such as neurons is a direct consequence of 
      their inability to divide and therefore provides a key to explaining their 
      persistence in neurodegenerative disease.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias in Spanish patients: genetic analysis of familial and 
      sporadic cases. The Ataxia Study Group.
PG  - 516-22
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically heterogeneous group 
      of neurodegenerative disorders caused by unstable CAG repeat expansions encoding 
      polyglutamine tracts. Five spinocerebellar ataxia genes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 
      and SCA7) and another related dominant ataxia gene (DRPLA) have been cloned, 
      allowing the genetic classification of these disorders. We present here the 
      molecular analysis of 87 unrelated familial and 60 sporadic Spanish cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia. For ADCA cases 15% were SCA2, 15% SCA3, 6% SCA1, 3% SCA7, 
      1% SCA6 and 1% DRPLA, an extremely rare mutation in Caucasoid populations. About 
      58% of ADCA cases remained genetically unclassified. All the SCA1 cases belong to 
      the same geographical area and share a common haplotype for the SCA1 mutation. 
      The expanded alleles ranged from 41 to 59 repeats for SCA1, 35 to 46 [corrected] 
      for SCA2, 67 to 77 for SCA3, and 38 to 113 for SCA7. One SCA6 case had 25 repeats 
      and one DRPLA case had 63 repeats. The highest CAG repeat variation in meiotic 
      transmission of expanded alleles was detected in SCA7, this being of +67 units in 
      one paternal transmission and giving rise to a 113 CAG repeat allele in a patient 
      who died at 3 years of age. Meiotic transmissions have also shown a tendency to 
      more frequent paternal transmission of expanded alleles in SCA1 and maternal in 
      SCA7. All SCA1 and SCA2 expanded alleles analyzed consisted of pure CAG repeats, 
      whereas normal alleles were interrupted by 1-2 CAT trinucleotides in SCA1, except 
      for three alleles of 6, 14 and 21 CAG repeats, and by 1-3 CAA trinucleotides in 
      SCA2. No SCA or DRPLA mutations were detected in the 60 sporadic cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia, but one late onset patient was identified as a recessive 
      form due to GAA-repeat expansions in the Friedreich's ataxia gene.

TI  - Close associations between prevalences of dominantly inherited spinocerebellar 
      ataxias with CAG-repeat expansions and frequencies of large normal CAG alleles in 
      Japanese and Caucasian populations.
PG  - 1060-6
AB  - To test the hypothesis that the frequencies of normal alleles (ANs) with a 
      relatively large number of CAG repeats (large ANs) are related to the prevalences 
      of the dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs)-SCA types 1, 2, 3 (Machado-Joseph 
      disease), 6, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA)-we investigated the 
      relative prevalences of these diseases in 202 Japanese and 177 Caucasian families 
      and distributions of the number of CAG repeats of ANs at these disease loci in 
      normal individuals in each population. The relative prevalences of SCA1 and SCA2 
      were significantly higher in Caucasian pedigrees (15% and 14%, respectively) than 
      in Japanese pedigrees (3% and 5%, respectively), corresponding to the observation 
      that the frequencies of large ANs of SCA1 (alleles >30 repeats) and of SCA2 
      (alleles >22 repeats) were significantly higher in Caucasians than in Japanese. 
      The relative prevalences of MJD/SCA3, SCA6, and DRPLA were significantly higher 
      in Japanese pedigrees (43%, 11%, and 20%, respectively) than in Caucasian 
      pedigrees (30%, 5%, and 0%, respectively), corresponding to the observation that 
      the frequencies of large ANs of MJD/SCA3 (>27 repeats), SCA6 (>13 repeats), and 
      DRPLA (>17 repeats) were significantly higher in Japanese than in Caucasians. The 
      close correlations of the relative prevalences of the dominant SCAs with the 
      distributions of large ANs strongly support the assumption that large ANs 
      contribute to generation of expanded alleles (AEs) and the relative prevalences 
      of the dominant SCAs.

TI  - SCA6 mutation analysis in a large cohort of the Japanese patients with late-onset 
      pure cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 89-95
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is caused by small CAG repeat expansion in 
      the gene encoding the alpha1A-voltage-dependent-calcium channel subunit 
      (CACNLIA4) on chromosome 19p13, and is a subgroup of the late-onset pure 
      cerebellar ataxia (ADCA III). To investigate the prevalence of SCA6 in the 
      Japanese, we analyzed this mutation in 23 families and 12 probands with ADCA III. 
      The specificity and stability of the CAG repeat were examined in additional 
      individuals and families with other miscellaneous dominant SCAs. The CAG 
      expansion of SCA6 gene was exclusively observed in 12 of 23 families (52%) and 12 
      proband cases with ADCA III, but not in others. The CAG repeat was 21-33 in the 
      disease-associated alleles (n=56), and 4-18 in normal alleles (n=1148). Expanded 
      alleles were stable during transmission, and a significant inverse correlation 
      for CAG repeat number with age at onset was noted. Our results indicate that SCA6 
      shares approximately half of the ADCA III in the Japanese, and that gene 
      mutations causing the remaining, have yet to be identified.

PG  - 23-7
AB  - An expanded and unstable CAG repeat in the coding region of the MJD1 gene is the 
      mutation responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia 3/Machado-Joseph disease. In 
      order to determine whether there was a higher degree of instability in affected 
      regions, the size of the expanded CAG repeat was analyzed in different regions of 
      the central nervous system, in two unrelated SCA3/MJD patients. The degree of 
      somatic mosaicism was quantified and compared to that in a SCA1 patient. 
      Instability of the expanded CAG repeat was observed in peripheral tissues as well 
      as in CNS of the three patients, but there was no correlation between the degree 
      of mosaicism and the selective vulnerability of CNS structures. As in the other 
      diseases caused by expanded CAG repeats, a lower degree of mosaicism was found in 
      the cerebellar cortex of both SCA1 and SCA3/MJD patients, probably reflecting 
      specific properties of this structure. In SCA3/MJD, the degree of mosaicism 
      seemed to correlate with age at death rather than with the size of the expanded 
      CAG repeat. Finally, somatic instability was more pronounced in SCA1 than in 
      SCA3/MJD patients.

TI  - The prevalence and wide clinical spectrum of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      trinucleotide repeat in patients with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 842-50
AB  - The dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) represent a clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of disorders linked by progressive deterioration in balance 
      and coordination. The utility of genetic classification of the ADCAs has been 
      highlighted by the striking variability in clinical phenotype observed within 
      families and the overlap in clinical phenotype observed between those with 
      different genotypes. The recent demonstration that spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      (SCA2) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion within the ataxin-2 gene has allowed 
      us to determine the frequency of SCA2 compared with SCA1, SCA3/Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD), and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) in patients with 
      sporadic and inherited ataxia. SCA2 accounts for 13% of patients with ADCA 
      (without retinal degeneration), intermediate between SCA1 and SCA3/MJD, which 
      account for 6% and 23%, respectively. Together, SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3/MJD 
      constitute >40% of the mutations leading to ADCA I in our population. No patient 
      without a family history of ataxia, or with a pure cerebellar or spastic 
      syndrome, tested positive for SCA1, SCA2, or SCA3. No overlap in ataxin-2 allele 
      size between normal and disease chromosomes, or intermediate-sized alleles, were 
      observed. Repeat length correlated inversely with age at onset, accounting for 
      approximately 80% of the variability in onset age. Haplotype analysis provided no 
      evidence for a single founder chromosome, and diverse ethnic origins were 
      observed among SCA2 kindreds. In addition, a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes 
      was observed among SCA2 patients, including typical mild dominant ataxia, the MJD 
      phenotype with facial fasciculations and lid retraction, and early-onset ataxia 
      with a rapid course, chorea, and dementia.

AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders characterized by slowly progressive cerebellar 
      ataxia. Recently, among the ataxias, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy have been 
      found to be caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the coding 
      region of the disease genes. We have analyzed the CAG repeats of 67 patients from 
      47 families with dominantly inherited ataxia who lived in the Kinki area of 
      Japan. The following results were obtained. First, 31 patients from 22 families 
      were found to be positive for the MJD repeat expansion, indicating that MJD is 
      the most common dominantly inherited ataxia in the Kinki area of Japan. Second, 
      no SCA1 repeat expansion was found among the families studied. This presents a 
      striking contrast to the fact that there are many families with SCA1 in Hokkaido 
      and the Tohoku area of Japan. These findings suggest geographic variation in 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias in Japan.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder 
      characterized by degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells, spinocerebellar 
      tracts, and selective brainstem neurons owing to the expansion of an unstable CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of the SCA1 mutation 
      and the intergenerational stability of trinucleotide repeats in mice, we have 
      generated transgenic mice expressing the human SCA1 gene with either a normal or 
      an expanded CAG tract. Both transgenes were stable in parent to offspring 
      transmissions. While all six transgenic lines expressing the unexpanded human 
      SCA1 allele had normal Purkinje cells, transgenic animals from five of six lines 
      with the expanded SCA1 allele developed ataxia and Purkinje cell degeneration. 
      These data indicate that expanded CAG repeats expressed in Purkinje cells are 
      sufficient to produce degeneration and ataxia and demonstrate that a mouse model 
      can be established for neurodegeneration caused by CAG repeat expansions.
