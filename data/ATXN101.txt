TI  - Diagnostic uplift through the implementation of short tandem repeat analysis 
      using exome sequencing.
LID - 10.1038/s41431-024-01542-w [doi]
AB  - To date, approximately 50 short tandem repeat (STR) disorders have been 
      identified; yet, clinical laboratories rarely conduct STR analysis on exomes. To 
      assess its diagnostic value, we analyzed STRs in 6099 exomes from 2510 families 
      with mostly suspected neurogenetic disorders. We employed ExpansionHunter and 
      REViewer to detect pathogenic repeat expansions, confirming them using orthogonal 
      methods. Genotype-phenotype correlations led to the diagnosis of thirteen 
      individuals in seven previously undiagnosed families, identifying three autosomal 
      dominant disorders: dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (n = 3), spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 7 (n = 2), and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (n = 2), resulting in a 
      diagnostic gain of 0.28% (7/2510). Additionally, we found expanded ATXN1 alleles 
      (>/=39 repeats) with varying patterns of CAT interruptions in twelve individuals, 
      accounting for approximately 0.19% in the Korean population. Our study 
      underscores the importance of integrating STR analysis into exome sequencing 
      pipeline, broadening the application of exome sequencing for STR assessments.

      spinocerebellar ataxia in China.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) is a neurological disease characterized by 
      action tremor in upper arms. Although its high heritability and prevalence 
      worldwide, its etiology and association with other diseases are still unknown. 
      METHOD: We investigated 10 common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), including SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, SCA36, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA) in 92 early-onset familial ET pedigrees in China collected from 
      2016 to 2022. RESULT: We found one SCA12 proband carried 51 CAG repeats within 
      PPP2R2B gene and one SCA3 proband with intermediate CAG repeats (55) with ATXN3 
      gene. The other 90 ET probands all had normal repeat expansions. CONCLUSION: 
      Tremor can be the initial phenotype of certain SCA. For early-onset, familial ET 
      patients, careful physical examinations are needed before genetic SCA screening.

TI  - The Cerebellar Cognitive Affective/Schmahmann Syndrome Scale in Spinocerebellar 
      Ataxias.
LID - 10.1007/s12311-023-01651-0 [doi]
AB  - The Cerebellar Cognitive Affective/Schmahmann Syndrome (CCAS) manifests as 
      impaired executive control, linguistic processing, visual spatial function, and 
      affect regulation. The CCAS has been described in the spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs), but its prevalence is unknown. We analyzed results of the CCAS/Schmahmann 
      Scale (CCAS-S), developed to detect and quantify CCAS, in two natural history 
      studies of 309 individuals Symptomatic for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, or SCA8, 
      26 individuals Pre-symptomatic for SCA1 or SCA3, and 37 Controls. We compared 
      total raw scores, domain scores, and total fail scores between Symptomatic, 
      Pre-symptomatic, and Control cohorts, and between SCA types. We calculated scale 
      sensitivity and selectivity based on CCAS category designation among Symptomatic 
      individuals and Controls, and correlated CCAS-S performance against age and 
      education, and in Symptomatic patients, against genetic repeat length, onset age, 
      disease duration, motor ataxia, depression, and fatigue. Definite CCAS was 
      identified in 46% of the Symptomatic group. False positive rate among Controls 
      was 5.4%. Symptomatic individuals had poorer global CCAS-S performance than 
      Controls, accounting for age and education. The domains of semantic fluency, 
      phonemic fluency, and category switching that tap executive function and 
      linguistic processing consistently separated Symptomatic individuals from 
      Controls. CCAS-S scores correlated most closely with motor ataxia. Controls were 
      similar to Pre-symptomatic individuals whose nearness to symptom onset was 
      unknown. The use of the CCAS-S identifies a high CCAS prevalence in a large 
      cohort of SCA patients, underscoring the utility of the scale and the notion that 
      the CCAS is the third cornerstone of clinical ataxiology.

AB  - Neurologists have a difficult time identifying sporadic cerebellar ataxia. 
      Multiple system atrophy of the cerebellar type (MSA-C), spontaneous late cortical 
      cerebellar atrophy, and prolonged alcohol use are a few possible causes. In a 
      group of people with sporadic cerebellar ataxia that was not MSA-C, an 
      autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) mutation was recently discovered. 
      Chinese single-hospital cohort will be used in this study to genetic screen for 
      SCA-related genes. One hundred forty individuals with CA were monitored over 8 
      years. Thirty-one individuals had familial CA, 109 patients had sporadic CA, 73 
      had MSA-C, and 36 had non-MSA-C sporadic CA. In 28 of the 31 non-MSA-C sporadic 
      patients who requested the test, we carried out gene analysis, including SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, SCA31, and 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The control group consisted of 
      family members of the patients. In 57% of the instances with spontaneous CA that 
      were not MSA-C, gene abnormalities were discovered. The most frequent exception 
      among individuals with sporadic CA was SCA6 (36%), followed by monsters in SCA1, 
      2, 3, 8, and DRPLA. In contrast, 75% of the patients with familial CA had gene 
      abnormalities, the most frequent of which was SCA6 abnormality. The age of 69 vs 
      59 was higher, and the CAG repeat length was a minor age of 23 vs 25 in the 
      former instances compared to the last one among individuals with SCA6 anomalies 
      that were sporadic as opposed to familial cases. In sporadic CA, 
      autosomal-dominant mutations in SCA genes, notably in SCA6, are common. Although 
      the cause of the increased incidence of SCA6 mutations is unknown, it may be 
      related to a greater age of onset and varied penetrance of SCA6 mutations.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat expansion in the ATXN1 gene. It is 
      characterized by the presence of polyglutamine (polyQ) intranuclear inclusion 
      bodies (IIBs) within affected neurons. In order to investigate the impact of 
      polyQ IIBs in SCA1 pathogenesis, we generated a novel protein aggregation model 
      by inducible overexpression of the mutant ATXN1(Q82) isoform in human 
      neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, we developed a simple and reproducible 
      protocol for the efficient isolation of insoluble IIBs. Biophysical 
      characterization showed that polyQ IIBs are enriched in RNA molecules which were 
      further identified by next-generation sequencing. Finally, a protein interaction 
      network analysis indicated that sequestration of essential RNA transcripts within 
      ATXN1(Q82) IIBs may affect the ribosome resulting in error-prone protein 
      synthesis and global proteome instability. These findings provide novel insights 
      into the molecular pathogenesis of SCA1, highlighting the role of polyQ IIBs and 
      their impact on critical cellular processes.

TI  - Prevalence of repeat expansions causing autosomal dominant spinocerebellar

AB  - In Japan, approximately 30% of spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) is hereditary, 
      and more than 90% of hereditary SCD is autosomal dominant SCD (AD-SCD). We have 
      previously reported the types of AD-SCD in Hokkaido, twice. In this study, we 
      investigated the status of AD-SCD mainly due to repeat expansions, covering the 
      period since the last report. We performed genetic analysis for 312 patients with 
      a clinical diagnosis of SCD, except for multiple system atrophy at medical 
      institutions in Hokkaido between January 2007 and December 2020. The median age 
      at the time of analysis was 58 (1-86) years. Pathogenic variants causing AD-SCD 
      due to repeat expansion were found in 61.5% (192 cases). Spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) 6 was the most common type in 25.3% (79 cases), followed by Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD)/SCA3 in 13.8% (43), SCA1 in 6.4% (20), SCA2 in 5.1% (16), SCA31 in 
      4.8% (15), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy in 4.8% (15), SCA7 in 0.6% (2), 
      and SCA8 in 0.6% (2). SCA17, 27B, 36, and 37 were not found. Compared to previous 
      reports, this study found a higher prevalence of SCA6 and a lower prevalence of 
      MJD/SCA3. An increasing number of cases identified by genetic testing, including 
      cases with no apparent family history, accurately revealed the distribution of 
      disease types in Hokkaido.

AB  - Expansions of repeat DNA tracts cause >70 diseases, and ongoing expansions in 
      brains exacerbate disease. During expansion mutations, single-stranded DNAs 
      (ssDNAs) form slipped-DNAs. We find the ssDNA-binding complexes canonical 
      replication protein A (RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3) and Alternative-RPA (RPA1, RPA3, and 
      primate-specific RPA4) are upregulated in Huntington disease and spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 1 (SCA1) patient brains. Protein interactomes of RPA and Alt-RPA 
      reveal unique and shared partners, including modifiers of CAG instability and 
      disease presentation. RPA enhances in vitro melting, FAN1 excision, and repair of 
      slipped-CAGs and protects against CAG expansions in human cells. RPA 
      overexpression in SCA1 mouse brains ablates expansions, coincident with decreased 
      ATXN1 aggregation, reduced brain DNA damage, improved neuron morphology, and 
      rescued motor phenotypes. In contrast, Alt-RPA inhibits melting, FAN1 excision, 
      and repair of slipped-CAGs and promotes CAG expansions. These findings suggest a 
      functional interplay between the two RPAs where Alt-RPA may antagonistically 
      offset RPA's suppression of disease-associated repeat expansions, which may 
      extend to other DNA processes.

TI  - Widespread alternative splicing dysregulation occurs presymptomatically in CAG 
      expansion spinocerebellar ataxias.
PG  - 486-504
LID - 10.1093/brain/awad329 [doi]
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative diseases, several of which are caused by CAG expansion 
      mutations (SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 12) and more broadly belong to the large family 
      of over 40 microsatellite expansion diseases. While dysregulation of alternative 
      splicing is a well defined driver of disease pathogenesis across several 
      microsatellite diseases, the contribution of alternative splicing in CAG 
      expansion SCAs is poorly understood. Furthermore, despite extensive studies on 
      differential gene expression, there remains a gap in our understanding of 
      presymptomatic transcriptomic drivers of disease. We sought to address these 
      knowledge gaps through a comprehensive study of 29 publicly available 
      RNA-sequencing datasets. We identified that dysregulation of alternative splicing 
      is widespread across CAG expansion mouse models of SCAs 1, 3 and 7. These changes 
      were detected presymptomatically, persisted throughout disease progression, were 
      repeat length-dependent, and were present in brain regions implicated in SCA 
      pathogenesis including the cerebellum, pons and medulla. Across disease 
      progression, changes in alternative splicing occurred in genes that function in 
      pathways and processes known to be impaired in SCAs, such as ion channels, 
      synaptic signalling, transcriptional regulation and the cytoskeleton. We 
      validated several key alternative splicing events with known functional 
      consequences, including Trpc3 exon 9 and Kcnma1 exon 23b, in the Atxn1154Q/2Q 
      mouse model. Finally, we demonstrated that alternative splicing dysregulation is 
      responsive to therapeutic intervention in CAG expansion SCAs with Atxn1 targeting 
      antisense oligonucleotide rescuing key splicing events. Taken together, these 
      data demonstrate that widespread presymptomatic dysregulation of alternative 
      splicing in CAG expansion SCAs may contribute to disease onset, early neuronal 
      dysfunction and may represent novel biomarkers across this devastating group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - There are more than 40 types of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), most of which are 
      caused by abnormal expansion of short tandem repeats at various gene loci. These 
      phenotypically similar disorders require molecular testing at multiple loci by 
      fluorescent PCR and capillary electrophoresis to identify the causative repeat 
      expansion. We describe a simple strategy to screen for the more common SCA1, 
      SCA2, and SCA3 by rapidly detecting the abnormal CAG repeat expansion at the 
      ATXN1, ATXN2, and ATXN3 loci using melting curve analysis of triplet-primed PCR 
      products. Each of the three separate assays employs a plasmid DNA carrying a 
      known repeat size to generate a threshold melt peak temperature, which 
      effectively distinguishes expansion-positive samples from those without a repeat 
      expansion. Samples that are screened positive based on their melt peak profiles 
      are subjected to capillary electrophoresis for repeat sizing and genotype 
      confirmation. These screening assays are robust and provide accurate detection of 
      the repeat expansion while eliminating the need for fluorescent PCR and capillary 
      electrophoresis for every sample.

AB  - Pathogenic short tandem repeat (STR) expansions cause over 20 neurodegenerative 
      diseases. To determine the contribution of STRs in sporadic amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), we used ExpansionHunter, 
      REviewer, and polymerase chain reaction validation to assess 21 neurodegenerative 
      disease-associated STRs in whole-genome sequencing data from 608 patients with 
      sporadic ALS, 68 patients with sporadic FTD, and 4703 matched controls. We also 
      propose a data-derived outlier detection method for defining allele thresholds in 
      rare STRs. Excluding C9orf72 repeat expansions, 17.6% of clinically diagnosed ALS 
      and FTD cases had at least one expanded STR allele reported to be pathogenic or 
      intermediate for another neurodegenerative disease. We identified and validated 
      162 disease-relevant STR expansions in C9orf72 (ALS/FTD), ATXN1 [spinal 
      cerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1)], ATXN2 (SCA2), ATXN8 (SCA8), TBP (SCA17), HTT 
      (Huntington's disease), DMPK [myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)], CNBP (DM2), and 
      FMR1 (fragile-X disorders). Our findings suggest clinical and pathological 
      pleiotropy of neurodegenerative disease genes and highlight their importance in 
      ALS and FTD.

TI  - Genetic variability in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
PG  - 3760-3769
LID - 10.1093/brain/awad120 [doi]
AB  - With the advent of gene therapies for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), there 
      is a surge in gene testing for this disease. Although there is ample experience 
      with gene testing for C9orf72, SOD1, FUS and TARDBP in familial ALS, large 
      studies exploring genetic variation in all ALS-associated genes in sporadic ALS 
      (sALS) are still scarce. Gene testing in a diagnostic setting is challenging, 
      given the complex genetic architecture of sALS, for which there are genetic 
      variants with large and small effect sizes. Guidelines for the interpretation of 
      genetic variants in gene panels and for counselling of patients are lacking. We 
      aimed to provide a thorough characterization of genetic variability in ALS genes 
      by applying the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria 
      on whole genome sequencing data from a large cohort of 6013 sporadic ALS patients 
      and 2411 matched controls from Project MinE. We studied genetic variation in 90 
      ALS-associated genes and applied customized ACMG-criteria to identify pathogenic 
      and likely pathogenic variants. Variants of unknown significance were collected 
      as well. In addition, we determined the length of repeat expansions in C9orf72, 
      ATXN1, ATXN2 and NIPA1 using the ExpansionHunter tool. We found C9orf72 repeat 
      expansions in 5.21% of sALS patients. In 50 ALS-associated genes, we did not 
      identify any pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. In 5.89%, a pathogenic or 
      likely pathogenic variant was found, most commonly in SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, NEK1, 
      OPTN or TBK1. Significantly more cases carried at least one pathogenic or likely 
      pathogenic variant compared to controls (odds ratio 1.75; P-value 1.64 x 10-5). 
      Isolated risk factors in ATXN1, ATXN2, NIPA1 and/or UNC13A were detected in 
      17.33% of cases. In 71.83%, we did not find any genetic clues. A combination of 
      variants was found in 2.88%. This study provides an inventory of pathogenic and 
      likely pathogenic genetic variation in a large cohort of sALS patients. Overall, 
      we identified pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in 11.13% of ALS patients 
      in 38 known ALS genes. In line with the oligogenic hypothesis, we found 
      significantly more combinations of variants in cases compared to controls. Many 
      variants of unknown significance may contribute to ALS risk, but diagnostic 
      algorithms to reliably identify and weigh them are lacking. This work can serve 
      as a resource for counselling and for the assembly of gene panels for ALS. 
      Further characterization of the genetic architecture of sALS is necessary given 
      the growing interest in gene testing in ALS.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxias (CAs) represent a group of autosomal dominant and recessive 
      neurodegenerative disorders affecting cerebellum with or without spinal cord. 
      Overall, CAs have preponderance for tandem nucleotide repeat expansions as an 
      etiological factor (10 TREs explain nearly 30-40% of ataxia cohort globally). The 
      experience of 10 years of common genetic ataxia subtypes for  approximately 5600 patients' 
      referrals (Pan-India) received at a single center is shared herein. Frequencies 
      (in %, n) of SCA types and FRDA in the sample cohort are observed as follows: 
      SCA12 (8.6%, 490); SCA2 (8.5%, 482); SCA1 (4.8%, 272); SCA3 (2%, 113); SCA7 
      (0.5%, 28); SCA6 (0.1%, 05); SCA17 (0.1%, 05), and FRDA (2.2%, 127). A 
      significant amount of variability in TRE lengths at each locus is observed, we 
      noted presence of biallelic expansion, co-occurrence of SCA-subtypes, and the 
      presence of premutable normal alleles. The frequency of mutated GAA-FRDA allele 
      in healthy controls is 1/158 (0.63%), thus an expected FRDA prevalence of 1:100 
      000 persons. The data of this study are relevant not only for clinical decision 
      making but also for guidance in direction of genetic investigations, 
      transancestral comparison of genotypes, and lastly provide insight for policy 
      decision for the consideration of SCAs under rare disease category.

TI  - Fast and reliable detection of repeat expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia using 
      exomes.
PG  - 717-721
LID - 10.1136/jmg-2022-108924 [doi]
AB  - Usually, molecular diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia is based on a step-by-step 
      approach with targeted sizing of four repeat expansions accounting for most 
      dominant cases, then targeted sequencing of other genes. Nowadays, genome 
      sequencing allows detection of most pathogenic variants in a single step. The 
      ExpansionHunter tool can detect expansions in short-read genome sequencing data. 
      Recent studies have shown that ExpansionHunter can also be used to identify 
      repeat expansions in exome sequencing data. We tested ExpansionHunter on 
      spinocerebellar ataxia exomes in a research context as a second-line analysis, 
      after exclusion of main CAG repeat expansions in half of the probands. First, we 
      confirmed the detection of expansions in seven known expansion carriers and then, 
      after targeted analysis of ATXN1, 2, 3 and 7, CACNA1A, TBP, ATN1, NOP56, AR and 
      HTT in 498 exomes, we found 22 additional pathogenic expansions. Comparison with 
      capillary migration sizing in 247 individuals and confirmation of all expanded 
      alleles detected by ExpansionHunter demonstrated that for these loci, sensitivity 
      and specificity reached 100%. ExpansionHunter detected but underestimated the 
      repeat size for larger expansions, and the normal alleles distribution at each 
      locus should be taken into account to detect expansions. Exome combined with 
      ExpansionHunter is reliable to detect repeat expansions in selected loci as 
      first-line analysis in spinocerebellar ataxia.

AB  - Genetic risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is highly elevated in 
      genetic isolates, like the island population of Malta in the south of Europe, 
      providing a unique opportunity to investigate the genetics of this disease. Here 
      we characterize the clinical phenotype and genetic profile of the largest series 
      of Maltese ALS patients to date identified throughout a 5-year window. Cases and 
      controls underwent neuromuscular assessment and analysis of rare variants in ALS 
      causative or risk genes following whole-genome sequencing. Potentially damaging 
      variants or repeat expansions were identified in more than 45% of all patients. 
      The most commonly affected genes were ALS2, DAO, SETX and SPG11, an infrequent 
      cause of ALS in Europeans. We also confirmed a significant association between 
      ATXN1 intermediate repeats and increased disease risk. Damaging variants in major 
      ALS genes C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP and FUS were however either absent or rare in 
      Maltese ALS patients. Overall, our study underscores a population that is an 
      outlier within Europe and one that represents a high percentage of genetically 
      explained cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic efficacy of clinical 
      exome-targeted sequencing (CES) and spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36) screening 
      in a real-life cohort of patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) from Eastern Spain. 
      METHODS: A total of 130 unrelated patients with CA, negative for common 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, 
      SCA17, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA], and Friedreich ataxia), were 
      studied with CES. Bioinformatic and genotype-phenotype analyses were performed to 
      assess the pathogenicity of the variants encountered. Copy number variants were 
      analyzed when appropriate. In undiagnosed dominant and sporadic cases, repeat 
      primed PCR was used to screen for the presence of a repeat expansion in the NOP56 
      gene. RESULTS: CES identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 50 
      families (39%), including 23 novel variants. Overall, there was a high genetic 
      heterogeneity, and the most frequent genetic diagnosis was SPG7 (n = 15), 
      followed by SETX (n = 6), CACNA1A (n = 5), POLR3A (n = 4), and SYNE1 (n = 3). In 
      addition, 17 families displayed likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants in 14 
      different genes: KCND3 (n = 2), KIF1C (n = 2), CYP27A1A (n = 2), AFG3L2 (n = 1), 
      ANO10 (n = 1), CAPN1 (n = 1), CWF19L1 (n = 1), ITPR1 (n = 1), KCNA1 (n = 1), OPA1 
      (n = 1), PNPLA6 (n = 1), SPG11 (n = 1), SPTBN2 (n = 1), and TPP1 (n = 1). 
      Twenty-two novel variants were characterized. SCA36 was diagnosed in 11 families, 
      all with autosomal dominant (AD) presentation. SCA36 screening increased the 
      total diagnostic rate to 47% (n = 61/130). Ultimately, undiagnosed patients 
      showed delayed age at onset (p < 0.05) and were more frequently sporadic. 
      DISCUSSION: Our study provides insight into the genetic landscape of CA in 
      Eastern Spain. Although CES was an effective approach to capture genetic 
      heterogeneity, most patients remained undiagnosed. SCA36 was found to be a 
      relatively frequent form and, therefore, should be tested prior to CES in 
      familial AD presentations in particular geographical regions.

AB  - While astrocyte heterogeneity is an important feature of the healthy brain, less 
      is understood about spatiotemporal heterogeneity of astrocytes in brain disease. 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene Ataxin1 (ATXN1). We characterized 
      astrocytes across disease progression in the four clinically relevant brain 
      regions, cerebellum, brainstem, hippocampus, and motor cortex, of Atxn1(154Q/2Q) 
      mice, a knock-in mouse model of SCA1. We found brain region-specific changes in 
      astrocyte density and GFAP expression and area, early in the disease and prior to 
      neuronal loss. Expression of astrocytic core homeostatic genes was also altered 
      in a brain region-specific manner and correlated with neuronal activity, 
      indicating that astrocytes may compensate or exacerbate neuronal dysfunction. 
      Late in disease, expression of astrocytic homeostatic genes was reduced in all 
      four brain regions, indicating loss of astrocyte functions. We observed no 
      obvious correlation between spatiotemporal changes in microglia and 
      spatiotemporal astrocyte alterations, indicating a complex orchestration of glial 
      phenotypes in disease. These results support spatiotemporal diversity of glial 
      phenotypes as an important feature of the brain disease that may contribute to 
      SCA1 pathogenesis in a brain region and disease stage-specific manner.

      cardiovascular disease.

AB  - AIMS: Quiescent, differentiated adult vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) can be 
      induced to proliferate and switch phenotype. Such plasticity underlies blood 
      vessel homeostasis and contributes to vascular disease development. Oligoclonal 
      VSMC contribution is a hallmark of end-stage vascular disease. Here, we aim to 
      understand cellular mechanisms underpinning generation of this VSMC 
      oligoclonality. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigate the dynamics of VSMC clone 
      formation using confocal microscopy and single-cell transcriptomics in 
      VSMC-lineage-traced animal models. We find that activation of medial VSMC 
      proliferation occurs at low frequency after vascular injury and that only a 
      subset of expanding clones migrate, which together drives formation of 
      oligoclonal neointimal lesions. VSMC contribution in small atherosclerotic 
      lesions is typically from one or two clones, similar to observations in mature 
      lesions. Low frequency (<0.1%) of clonal VSMC proliferation is also observed in 
      vitro. Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed progressive cell state changes across 
      a contiguous VSMC population at onset of injury-induced proliferation. 
      Proliferating VSMCs mapped selectively to one of two distinct trajectories and 
      were associated with cells showing extensive phenotypic switching. A 
      proliferation-associated transitory state shared pronounced similarities with 
      atypical SCA1+ VSMCs from uninjured mouse arteries and VSMCs in healthy human 
      aorta. We show functionally that clonal expansion of SCA1+ VSMCs from healthy 
      arteries occurs at higher rate and frequency compared with SCA1- cells. 
      CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that activation of proliferation at low frequency is 
      a general, cell-intrinsic feature of VSMCs. We show that rare VSMCs in healthy 
      arteries display VSMC phenotypic switching akin to that observed in pathological 
      vessel remodelling and that this is a conserved feature of mouse and human 
      healthy arteries. The increased proliferation of modulated VSMCs from healthy 
      arteries suggests that these cells respond more readily to disease-inducing cues 
      and could drive oligoclonal VSMC expansion.

TI  - The S-Factor, a New Measure of Disease Severity in Spinocerebellar Ataxia: 
      Findings and Implications.
PG  - 790-809
LID - 10.1007/s12311-022-01424-1 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are progressive neurodegenerative disorders, but 
      there is no metric that predicts disease severity over time. We hypothesized that 
      by developing a new metric, the Severity Factor (S-Factor) using immutable 
      disease parameters, it would be possible to capture disease severity independent 
      of clinical rating scales. Extracting data from the CRC-SCA and READISCA natural 
      history studies, we calculated the S-Factor for 438 participants with symptomatic 
      SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6, as follows: ((length of CAG repeat expansion - maximum 
      normal repeat length) /maximum normal repeat length) x (current age - age at 
      disease onset) x 10). Within each SCA type, the S-Factor at the first Scale for 
      the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) visit (baseline) was correlated 
      against scores on SARA and other motor and cognitive assessments. In 281 
      participants with longitudinal data, the slope of the S-Factor over time was 
      correlated against slopes of scores on SARA and other motor rating scales. At 
      baseline, the S-Factor showed moderate-to-strong correlations with SARA and other 
      motor rating scales at the group level, but not with cognitive performance. 
      Longitudinally the S-Factor slope showed no consistent association with the slope 
      of performance on motor scales. Approximately 30% of SARA slopes reflected a 
      trend of non-progression in motor symptoms. The S-Factor is an 
      observer-independent metric of disease burden in SCAs. It may be useful at the 
      group level to compare cohorts at baseline in clinical studies. Derivation and 
      examination of the S-factor highlighted challenges in the use of clinical rating 
      scales in this population.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating, heterogeneous 
      neurodegenerative neuromuscular disease that leads to a fatal outcome within 
      2-5 years, and yet, a precise nature of the association between its major 
      phenotypes and the cerebellar role in ALS pathology remains unknown. Recently, 
      repeat expansions in several genes in which variants appreciably contribute to 
      cerebellar pathology, including C9orf72, NIPA1, ATXN2 and ATXN1, have been found 
      to confer a significant risk for ALS. To better define this relationship, we 
      performed MAGMA gene-based analysis and tissue enrichment analysis using 
      genome-wide association study summary statistics based on a study of 27,205 
      people with ALS and 110,881 controls. Our preliminary results imply a striking 
      cerebellar tissue specificity and further support increasing calls for 
      re-evaluation of the cerebellar role in the ALS pathology.

      SCAs.
PG  - 1310-1315
LID - 10.1002/acn3.51613 [doi]
AB  - CAG repeat-expansion spinocerebellar ataxias (CAG-SCAs) are genetically defined 
      multisystemic degenerative diseases, resulting in motor symptoms including 
      dysarthria with a substantial impact on daily living. Whilst speech therapy is 
      widely recommended in ataxia, very limited evidence exists for its use. We 
      evaluated the efficacy of a home-delivered, ataxia-tailored biofeedback-driven 
      speech therapy in CAG-SCA in 16 individuals with SCA1, 2, 3, or 6. Treatment was 
      delivered intensively over 20 days. Efficacy was evaluated by blinded ratings of 
      intelligibility (primary) and acoustic measures (secondary) leveraging an 
      intra-individual control design. Intelligibility improved post-treatment 
      (Z = -3.18, p = 0.004) whilst remaining stable prior to treatment (Z = 0.53, 
      p = 1.00).

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by a (CAG) repeat expansion in the coding sequence of ATXN1. The 
      primary mechanism of disease in SCA1 is toxic gain of function by 
      polyglutamine-expanded mutant ATXN1 and is compounded by partial loss of 
      wild-type function. Addressing both disease mechanisms, we have shown that 
      virally expressed RNA interference targeting ATXN1 can both prevent and reverse 
      disease phenotypes in SCA1 mice, and that overexpression of the ATXN1 homolog, 
      ataxin 1-like (ATXN1L), improves disease readouts when delivered 
      pre-symptomatically. Here, we combined these therapeutic approaches into two, 
      dual component recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors and tested their 
      ability to reverse disease in symptomatic SCA1 mice using behavior, pathological, 
      and next-generation sequencing assays. Mice treated with vectors expressing human 
      ATXN1L (hATXN1L) alone showed motor improvements and changes in gene expression 
      that reflected increases in pro-development pathways. When hATN1L was combined 
      with miS1, a previously validated microRNA targeting h ATXN1, there was added 
      normalization of disease allele-induced changes in gene expression along with 
      motor improvements. Our data show the additive nature of this two-component 
      approach for a more effective SCA1 therapy.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a presently incurable neurodegenerative 
      disease. Some genes have a causal relationship to ALS, others act as 
      susceptibility and/or risk factors. We aimed to elucidate the role of 14 
      ALS-related genes in the Hungarian ALS population of 183 patients. Mutation 
      screening of major ALS genes was performed. SMN1 and SMN2 genes were examined by 
      multiplex ligation-dependent probe-amplification assay; intermediate repeat 
      expansions in the ATXN1 and ATXN2 genes were analyzed by fragment analysis. 
      Additional variants in putative ALS genes were screened from previously acquired 
      next generation sequencing data. We confirmed the repeat expansion of the 
      C9orf72, ATXN1 and ATXN2 genes as ALS risk factors in this Hungarian cohort. 
      Additionally, we identified a pathogenic SOD1 mutation and suggested its founder 
      effect. A likely pathogenic variant in the MFSD8 gene was detected, and variants 
      of interest were uncovered in the ANXA11 and GLT8D1 genes. We provide valuable 
      data as part of the growing body of work on population-specific aspects of the 
      genetic background of ALS.

TI  - Evolution of disability in spinocerebellar ataxias type 1, 2, 3, and 6.
PG  - 286-295
LID - 10.1002/acn3.51515 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the evolution of disability in spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCAs) type 1, 2, 3, and 6 (SCA1, 2, 3, 6). METHODS: We analyzed data of 
      two longitudinal cohorts (RISCA, EUROSCA) which recruited ataxic and non-ataxic 
      SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6 mutation carriers. To study disability, we used a 
      five-stage system for ataxia defined by walking ability (stages 0-3) and death 
      (stage 4). Transitions were analyzed using a multi-state model with proportional 
      transition hazards. Based on the hazard estimates, transition probabilities and 
      the expected lengths of stay in each stage were calculated. We further studied 
      the effect of sex and CAG repeat length on progression. RESULTS: Data of 3138 
      visits in 677 participants were analyzed. Median SARA scores for SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, and SCA6 ranged from 1.5 (interquartile range [IQR] = 0.0-3.5) to 3.5 
      (IQR = 1.4-6.1) in stage 0, 11.5 (IQR = 9.6-14.0) to 13.8 (IQR = 11.0-16.0) in 
      stage 1, 19.0 (IQR = 17.0-21.0) to 23.8 (IQR = 19.5-27.0) in stage 2, and 28.5 
      (IQR = 26.0-32.5) to 34.0 (IQR = 32.6-37.1) in stage 3. Modeling allowed to 
      calculate the subtype-specific probability to be in a certain stage at a given 
      age and duration of each stage. CAG repeat length was associated with faster 
      progression in SCA1 (HR, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.1-1.2), SCA2 (1.2, 1.1-1.3), and SCA3 
      (1.1, 1.0-1.2). In SCA6, female sex was associated with faster progression (1.7, 
      1.1-2.6). INTERPRETATION: Our data are important for counselling of patients, 
      assessment of the relevance of outcome markers, and design of clinical trials.

      disorders in the UK: a retrospective diagnostic accuracy and prospective clinical

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansion disorders affect about 1 in 3000 individuals and are 
      clinically heterogeneous diseases caused by expansions of short tandem DNA 
      repeats. Genetic testing is often locus-specific, resulting in underdiagnosis of 
      people who have atypical clinical presentations, especially in paediatric 
      patients without a previous positive family history. Whole genome sequencing is 
      increasingly used as a first-line test for other rare genetic disorders, and we 
      aimed to assess its performance in the diagnosis of patients with neurological 
      repeat expansion disorders. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic 
      accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect the most common repeat expansion 
      loci associated with neurological outcomes (AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, 
      C9orf72, CACNA1A, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, and TBP) using samples obtained within 
      the National Health Service in England from patients who were suspected of having 
      neurological disorders; previous PCR test results were used as the reference 
      standard. The clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat 
      expansions was prospectively examined in previously genetically tested and 
      undiagnosed patients recruited in 2013-17 to the 100 000 Genomes Project in the 
      UK, who were suspected of having a genetic neurological disorder (familial or 
      early-onset forms of ataxia, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, dementia, motor 
      neuron disease, parkinsonian movement disorders, intellectual disability, or 
      neuromuscular disorders). If a repeat expansion call was made using whole genome 
      sequencing, PCR was used to confirm the result. FINDINGS: The diagnostic accuracy 
      of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat expansions was evaluated against 793 
      PCR tests previously performed within the NHS from 404 patients. Whole genome 
      sequencing correctly classified 215 of 221 expanded alleles and 1316 of 1321 
      non-expanded alleles, showing 97.3% sensitivity (95% CI 94.2-99.0) and 99.6% 
      specificity (99.1-99.9) across the 13 disease-associated loci when compared with 
      PCR test results. In samples from 11 631 patients in the 100 000 Genomes Project, 
      whole genome sequencing identified 81 repeat expansions, which were also tested 
      by PCR: 68 were confirmed as repeat expansions in the full pathogenic range, 11 
      were non-pathogenic intermediate expansions or premutations, and two were 
      non-expanded repeats (16% false discovery rate). INTERPRETATION: In our study, 
      whole genome sequencing for the detection of repeat expansions showed high 
      sensitivity and specificity, and it led to identification of neurological repeat 
      expansion disorders in previously undiagnosed patients. These findings support 
      implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical laboratories for diagnosis 
      of patients who have a neurological presentation consistent with a repeat 
      expansion disorder. FUNDING: Medical Research Council, Department of Health and

TI  - Genetic Distribution of Five Spinocerebellar Ataxia Microsatellite Loci in 
      Mexican Native American Populations and Its Impact on Contemporary Mestizo 
      Populations.

LID - 157
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) conform a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders with autosomal dominant inheritance. Five of the most frequent SCAs are 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the exons of specific genes. The SCAs 
      incidence and the distribution of polymorphic CAG alleles vary among populations 
      and ethnicities. Thus, characterization of the genetic architecture of ethnically 
      diverse populations, which have undergone recent admixture and demographic 
      events, could facilitate the identification of genetic risk factors. Owing to the 
      great ethnic diversity of the Mexican population, this study aimed to analyze the 
      allele frequencies of five SCA microsatellite loci (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and 
      SCA7) in eleven Mexican Native American (MNA) populations. Data from the 
      literature were used to compare the allelic distribution of SCA loci with 
      worldwide populations. The SCA loci allelic frequencies evidenced a certain 
      genetic homogeneity in the MNA populations, except for Mayans, who exhibited 
      distinctive genetic profiles. Neither pathological nor large normal alleles were 
      found in MNA populations, except for the SCA2 pre-mutated allele in the Zapotec 
      population. Collectively, our findings demonstrated the contribution of the MNA 
      ancestry in shaping the genetic structure of contemporary Mexican Mestizo 
      populations. Our results also suggest that Native American ancestry has no impact 
      on the origin of SCAs in the Mexican population. Instead, the acquisition of 
      pathological SCA alleles could be associated with European migration.

TI  - Macular Morpho-Functional and Visual Pathways Functional Assessment in Patients 
      with Spinocerebellar Type 1 Ataxia with or without Neurological Signs.
LID - 10.3390/jcm10225271 [doi]
LID - 5271
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA-ATXN1) is an autosomal dominant, 
      neurodegenerative disease, caused by CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin-1 gene 
      (ATXN1). In isolated reports of patients with neurological signs [symptomatic 
      patients (SP)], macular abnormalities have been described. However, no reports 
      exist about macular anomalies in SCA1 subjects carrying the ATXN1 mutation 
      without neurological signs [not symptomatic carriers (NSC)]. Therefore, the main 
      aim of our work was to evaluate whether the macular functional and morphological 
      abnormalities could be detectable in SP, genetically confirmed and with 
      neurological signs, as well as in SCA-ATXN1-NSC, harboring pathogenic CAG 
      expansion in ATXN1. In addition, we investigated whether the macular involvement 
      could be associated or not to an impairment of RGCs and of their fibers and of 
      the neural conduction along the visual pathways. Herein, nine SCA-ATXN1 subjects 
      (6 SP and 3 NSC) underwent the following examinations: visual acuity and 
      chromatic test assessments, fundus oculi (FO) examination, macular and 
      peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL-T) analysis by Spectral 
      domain-Optical Coherence Tomography (Sd-OCT) acquisition, multifocal 
      electroretinogram (mfERG), pattern reversal electroretinogram (PERG) and visual 
      evoked potentials (VEP) recordings. In four eyes of two SP, visual acuity 
      reduction and chromatic abnormalities were observed; in three of them FO changes 
      associated with macular thinning and outer retinal defects were also detected. In 
      three NSC eyes, slight FO abnormalities were associated with qualitative macular 
      morphological changes. By contrast, abnormal mfERG responses (exclusively from 
      foveal and parafoveal areas) were detected in all SP and NSC (18 eyes). No 
      abnormalities of PERG values, RNFL-T, and VEP responses were found, but in one 
      SP, presenting abnormal papillo-macular bundle neural conduction. Results from 
      our SCA-ATXN1 cohort suggest that a macular dysfunction, detectable by mfERG 
      recordings, may occur in the overt disorder, and unexpectedly in the stage of the 
      disease in which there is still an absence of neurological signs. In NSC, an 
      exclusive dysfunction of preganglionic macular elements can be observed, and this 
      is associated with both normal RGCs function and neural conduction along the 
      visual pathways.

TI  - Detection Methods and Status of CAT Interruption of ATXN1 in Korean Patients With 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1.
PG  - 274-277
LID - 10.3343/alm.2022.42.2.274 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by 
      abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin 1 gene (ATXN1). The presence of CAT 
      interruption(s) is important for diagnosing SCA1 in patients with 39-44 repeat 
      alleles, as only uninterrupted alleles are considered abnormal. Determining the 
      CAT interruption status might also be important for patients with >44 repeats, as 
      the length of the longest uninterrupted CAG repeat stretch has been correlated 
      with age at SCA1 onset. We detected CAT interruption(s) in the archived samples 
      of Korean SCA1 patients using a traditional restriction enzyme method and 
      validated the usefulness of a fluorescence-based tethering PCR procedure. Among 
      the 2,312 alleles analyzed from 1,156 patients, we found 17 expanded alleles with 
      >/=39 repeats, 71% of which harbored 39-44 repeats. Restriction enzyme method of 
      six samples (four with 39-44 repeats and two with >44 repeats) revealed that none 
      of the expanded alleles had CAT interruption(s). Tethering PCR showed the 
      characteristic electropherogram pattern expected without CAT interruption(s). 
      Along with the enzyme restriction method, tethering PCR can be applied to 
      determine the number of allele repeats and provide information on CAT 
      interruption(s) in clinical laboratories.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetics of cerebellar ataxia is complex. Hundreds of causative 
      genes have been identified, but only a few cause more than single cases. The 
      spectrum of ataxia-causing genes differs considerably between populations. The 
      aim of the study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of ataxia in the 
      Finnish population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients in hospital database were 
      reviewed for the diagnosis of unspecified ataxia. Acquired ataxias and nongenetic 
      ataxias such as those related to infection, trauma or stroke were excluded. Sixty 
      patients with sporadic ataxia with unknown etiology and 36 patients with familial 
      ataxia of unknown etiology were recruited in the study. Repeat expansions in the 
      SCA genes (ATXN1, 2, 3, 7, 8/OS, CACNA1A, TBP), FXN, and RFC1 were determined. 
      Point mutations in POLG, SPG7 and in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were investigated. 
      In addition, DNA from 8 patients was exome sequenced. RESULTS: A genetic cause of 
      ataxia was found in 33 patients (34.4%). Seven patients had a dominantly 
      inherited repeat expansion in ATXN8/OS. Ten patients had mitochondrial ataxia 
      resulting from mutations in nuclear mitochondrial genes POLG or RARS2, or from a 
      point mutation m.8561C > G or a single deletion in mtDNA. Interestingly, five 
      patients were biallelic for the recently identified pathogenic repeat expansion 
      in RFC1. All the five patients presented with the phenotype of cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia (CANVAS). Moreover, screening of 54 patients 
      with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy revealed four additional patients with 
      biallelic repeat expansion in RFC1, but none of them had cerebellar symptoms. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Expansion in ATXN8/OS results in the majority of dominant ataxias in 
      Finland, while mutations in RFC1 and POLG are the most common cause of recessive 
      ataxias. Our results suggest that analysis of RFC1 should be included in the 
      routine diagnostics of idiopathic ataxia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth polyneuropathy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening for short tandem repeat (STR) expansions in next-generation 
      sequencing data can enable diagnosis, optimal clinical management/treatment, and 
      accurate genetic counseling of patients with repeat expansion disorders. We aimed 
      to develop an efficient computational workflow for reliable detection of STR 
      expansions in next-generation sequencing data and demonstrate its clinical 
      utility. METHODS: We characterized the performance of eight STR analysis methods 
      (lobSTR, HipSTR, RepeatSeq, ExpansionHunter, TREDPARSE, GangSTR, STRetch, and 
      exSTRa) on next-generation sequencing datasets of samples with known 
      disease-causing full-mutation STR expansions and genomes simulated to harbor 
      repeat expansions at selected loci and optimized their sensitivity. We then used 
      a machine learning decision tree classifier to identify an optimal combination of 
      methods for full-mutation detection. In Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)-aligned 
      genomes, the ensemble approach of using ExpansionHunter, STRetch, and exSTRa 
      performed the best (precision = 82%, recall = 100%, F1-score = 90%). We applied 
      this pipeline to screen 301 families of children with suspected genetic 
      disorders. RESULTS: We identified 10 individuals with full-mutations in the AR, 
      ATXN1, ATXN8, DMPK, FXN, or HTT disease STR locus in the analyzed families. 
      Additional candidates identified in our analysis include two probands with 
      borderline ATXN2 expansions between the established repeat size range for 
      reduced-penetrance and full-penetrance full-mutation and seven individuals with 
      FMR1 CGG repeats in the intermediate/premutation repeat size range. In 67 
      probands with a prior negative clinical PCR test for the FMR1, FXN, or DMPK 
      disease STR locus, or the spinocerebellar ataxia disease STR panel, our pipeline 
      did not falsely identify aberrant expansion. We performed clinical PCR tests on 
      seven (out of 10) full-mutation samples identified by our pipeline and confirmed 
      the expansion status in all, showing absolute concordance between our 
      bioinformatics and molecular findings. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully 
      demonstrated the application of a well-optimized bioinformatics pipeline that 
      promotes the utility of genome-wide sequencing as a first-tier screening test to 
      detect expansions of known disease STRs. Interrogating clinical next-generation 
      sequencing data for pathogenic STR expansions using our ensemble pipeline can 
      improve diagnostic yield and enhance clinical outcomes for patients with repeat 
      expansion disorders.

TI  - Repeats expansions in ATXN2, NOP56, NIPA1 and ATXN1 are not associated with ALS 
      in Africans.
PG  - 130-135

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized primarily by progressive loss of motor neurons. Although ALS occurs 
      worldwide and the frequency and spectrum of identifiable genetic causes of 
      disease varies across populations, very few studies have included African 
      subjects. In addition to a hexanucleotide repeat expansion (RE) in C9orf72, the 
      most common genetic cause of ALS in Europeans, REs in ATXN2, NIPA1 and ATXN1 have 
      shown variable associations with ALS in Europeans. Intermediate range expansions 
      in some of these genes (e.g. ATXN2) have been reported as potential risk factors, 
      or phenotypic modifiers, of ALS. Pathogenic expansions in NOP56 cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-36, which can present with prominent motor neuron 
      degeneration. Here we compare REs in these genes in a cohort of Africans with ALS 
      and population controls using whole genome sequencing data. Targeting genotyping 
      of short tandem repeats at known loci within ATXN2, NIPA1, ATXN1 and NOP56 was 
      performed using ExpansionHunter software in 105 Southern African (SA) patients 
      with ALS. African population controls were from an in-house SA population control 
      database (n = 25), the SA Human Genome Program (n = 24), the Simons Genome 
      Diversity Project (n = 39) and the Illumina Polaris Diversity Cohort (IPDC) 
      dataset (n = 50). We found intermediate RE alleles in ATXN2 (27-33 repeats) and 
      ATXN1 (33-35 repeats), and NIPA1 long alleles (>/=8 repeats) were rare in Africans, 
      and not associated with ALS (p > 0.17). NOP56 showed no expanded alleles in 
      either ALS or controls. We also compared the differences in allele distributions 
      between the African and n = 50 European controls (from the IPDC). There was a 
      statistical significant difference in the distribution of the REs in the ATXN1 
      between African and European controls (Chi-test p < 0.001), and NIPA1 showed 
      proportionately more longer alleles (RE > 8) in Europeans vs. Africans (Fisher's 
      p = 0.016). The distribution of RE alleles in ATXN2 and NOP56 were similar 
      amongst African and European controls. In conclusion, repeat expansions in ATXN2, 
      NIPA1 and ATXN1, which showed associations with ALS in Europeans, were not 
      replicated in Southern Africans with ALS.

TI  - DNAzyme Cleavage of CAG Repeat RNA in Polyglutamine Diseases.
PG  - 1710-1728
LID - 10.1007/s13311-021-01075-w [doi]
AB  - CAG repeat expansion is the genetic cause of nine incurable polyglutamine (polyQ) 
      diseases with neurodegenerative features. Silencing repeat RNA holds great 
      therapeutic value. Here, we developed a repeat-based RNA-cleaving DNAzyme that 
      catalyzes the destruction of expanded CAG repeat RNA of six polyQ diseases with 
      high potency. DNAzyme preferentially cleaved the expanded allele in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) cells. While cleavage was 
      non-allele-specific for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) cells, treatment of 
      DNAzyme leads to improved cell viability without affecting mitochondrial 
      metabolism or p62-dependent aggresome formation. DNAzyme appears to be stable in 
      mouse brain for at least 1 month, and an intermediate dosage of DNAzyme in a SCA3 
      mouse model leads to a significant reduction of high molecular weight ATXN3 
      proteins. Our data suggest that DNAzyme is an effective RNA silencing molecule 
      for potential treatment of multiple polyQ diseases.

TI  - Molecular spectrum, family screening and genetic counselling of Spinocerebellar 
      Ataxia (SCA) cases in an Indian scenario.
PG  - 370-380
LID - 10.1080/01677063.2021.1940172 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA) is a heterogeneous adult-onset disorder with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance pattern mainly caused by triplet repeat 
      expansions. Clinical diagnosis of SCA is based on phenotypic features followed by 
      confirmation through molecular diagnosis. To identify status of repeat range in 
      Indian SCA cases and provide extended family screening, we enrolled 70 clinical 
      SCA suspects. For molecular diagnosis, multiplex PCR (M-PCR) was used for common 
      Indian SCA subtypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12 and 17. TP-PCR was further used in 
      SCA2, 7 and 10 to identify larger expansions. Eighteen out of 70 SCA suspects 
      (25%) were found to be positive for various SCA subtypes- (5 SCA1 (28%), 6 SAC2 
      (34%), 2 SCA3 (12%), 3 SCA7 (16%) and one each for SCA6 (1%) and SCA17 (1%) 
      subtypes). Genetic counselling and extended family screening were offered to all 
      positive cases and yielded additional nine cases. We have established M-PCR and 
      TP-PCR to detect the CAG repeat expansion in SCA suspects. This method can 
      confirm SCA subtypes in a reliable, rapid and cost-effective way. Genetic 
      characterization of SCA-related genes has great clinical relevance, as it could 
      provide additional information and guidance to clinicians and family members 
      regarding prognosis.

PG  - 117-125
LID - 10.1007/s10286-020-00759-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Investigate single nucleotide variants and short tandem repeats in 39 
      genes related to spinocerebellar ataxia in clinical and pathologically defined 
      cohorts of multiple system atrophy. METHODS: Exome sequencing was conducted in 28 
      clinical multiple system atrophy patients to identify single nucleotide variants 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes. Novel variants were validated in two 
      independent disease cohorts: 86 clinically diagnosed multiple system atrophy 
      patients and 166 pathological multiple system atrophy cases. Expanded repeat 
      alleles in spinocerebellar ataxia genes were evaluated in 36 clinically diagnosed 
      multiple system atrophy patients, and CAG/CAA repeats in TATA-Box Binding Protein 
      (TBP, causative of SCA17) were screened in 216 clinical and pathological multiple 
      system atrophy patients and 346 controls. RESULTS: No known pathogenic 
      spinocerebellar ataxia single nucleotide variants or pathogenic range expanded 
      repeat alleles of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, AXTN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, 
      and TBP were detected in any clinical multiple system atrophy patients. However, 
      four novel variants were identified in four spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes 
      across three multiple system atrophy patients. Additionally, four multiple system 
      atrophy patients (1.6%) and one control (0.3%) carried an intermediate length 41 
      TBP CAG/CAA repeat allele (OR = 4.11, P = 0.21). There was a significant 
      association between the occurrence of a repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) and an increased risk of multiple system atrophy (OR = 1.64, P = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: Occurrence of TBP CAG/CAA repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) is significantly associated with increased multiple system atrophy risk. 
      This discovery warrants further investigation and supports a possible genetic 
      overlap of multiple system atrophy with SCA17.

TI  - Genomic Portrait of a Sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Case in a Large 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 Family.
LID - 10.3390/jpm10040262 [doi]
LID - 262
AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansions in the spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) gene 
      ATXN1 increases the risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), supporting a 
      relationship between these disorders. We recently reported the co-existence, in a 
      large SCA1 family, of a clinically definite ALS individual bearing an 
      intermediate ATXN1 expansion and SCA1 patients with a full expansion, some of 
      which manifested signs of lower motor neuron involvement. METHODS: In this study, 
      we employed a systems biology approach that integrated multiple genomic analyses 
      of the ALS patient and some SCA1 family members. RESULTS: Our analysis identified 
      common and distinctive candidate genes/variants and related biological processes 
      that, in addition to or in combination with ATXN1, may contribute to motor neuron 
      degeneration phenotype. Among these, we distinguished ALS-specific likely 
      pathogenic variants in TAF15 and C9ORF72, two ALS-linked genes involved in the 
      regulation of RNA metabolism, similarly to ATXN1, suggesting a selective role for 
      this pathway in ALS pathogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our work supports the 
      utility to apply personal genomic information for characterizing complex disease 
      phenotypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3 and Huntington disease are 
      neurodegenerative disorders caused by expanded CAG repeats. METHODS: We performed 
      an in-silico analysis of CAG repeats in ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, and HTT using 30x 
      whole-=genome sequencing data of 2504 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. 
      RESULTS: Seven HTT-positive, 3 ATXN2-positive, 1 ATXN3-positive, and 6 possibly 
      ATXN1-positive samples were identified. No correlation was found between the 
      repeat sizes of the different genes. The distribution of CAG alleles varied by 
      ethnicity. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that there may be asymptomatic small 
      expanded repeats in almost 0.5% of these populations. (c) 2020 International

TI  - ATXN1 repeat expansions confer risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 
      contribute to TDP-43 mislocalization.
PG  - fcaa064

AB  - Increasingly, repeat expansions are being identified as part of the complex 
      genetic architecture of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To date, several repeat 
      expansions have been genetically associated with the disease: intronic repeat 
      expansions in C9orf72, polyglutamine expansions in ATXN2 and polyalanine 
      expansions in NIPA1. Together with previously published data, the identification 
      of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patient with a family history of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, caused by polyglutamine expansions in ATXN1, 
      suggested a similar disease association for the repeat expansion in ATXN1. We, 
      therefore, performed a large-scale international study in 11 700 individuals, in 
      which we showed a significant association between intermediate ATXN1 repeat 
      expansions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (P = 3.33 x 10(-7)). Subsequent 
      functional experiments have shown that ATXN1 reduces the nucleocytoplasmic ratio 
      of TDP-43 and enhances amyotrophic lateral sclerosis phenotypes in Drosophila, 
      further emphasizing the role of polyglutamine repeat expansions in the 
      pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

TI  - Conversion of individuals at risk for spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, and 6 
      to manifest ataxia (RISCA): a longitudinal cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative diseases. Our aim was to study the conversion to manifest 
      ataxia among apparently healthy carriers of mutations associated with the most 
      common SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6), and the sensitivity of clinical and 
      functional measures to detect change in these individuals. METHODS: In this 
      prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study, based at 14 referral 
      centres in seven European countries, we enrolled children or siblings of patients 
      with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6. Eligible individuals were those without ataxia, 
      defined by a score on the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) of 
      less than 3; participants had to be aged 18-50 years for children or siblings of 
      patients with SCA1, SCA2, or SCA3, and 35-70 years for children or siblings of 
      patients with SCA6. Study visits took place at recruitment and after 2, 4, and 6 
      years (plus or minus 3 months). We did genetic testing to identify mutation 
      carriers, with results concealed to the participant and clinical investigator. We 
      assessed patients with clinical scales, questionnaires of patient-reported 
      outcome measures, a rating of the examiner's confidence of presence of ataxia, 
      and performance-based coordination tests. Conversion to ataxia was defined by an 
      SARA score of 3 or higher. We analysed the association of factors at baseline 
      with conversion to ataxia and the evolution of outcome parameters on temporal 
      scales (time from inclusion and time to predicted age at ataxia onset) in the 
      context of mutation status and conversion status. This study is registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01037777. FINDINGS: Between Sept 13, 2008, and Oct 28, 
      2015, 302 participants were enrolled. We analysed data for 252 participants with 
      at least one follow-up visit. 83 (33%) participants were from families affected 
      by SCA1, 99 (39%) by SCA2, 46 (18%) by SCA3, and 24 (10%) by SCA6. In 
      participants who carried SCA mutations, 26 (52%) of 50 SCA1 carriers, 22 (59%) of 
      37 SCA2 carriers, 11 (42%) of 26 SCA3 carriers, and two (13%) of 15 SCA6 carriers 
      converted to ataxia. One (3%) of 33 SCA1 non-carriers and one (2%) of 62 SCA2 
      non-carriers converted to ataxia. Owing to the small number of people who met our 
      criteria for ataxia, subsequent analyses could not be done in carriers of the 
      SCA6 mutation. Baseline factors associated with conversion were age (hazard ratio 
      1.13 [95% CI 1.03-1.24]; p=0.011), CAG repeat length (1.25 [1.11-1.41]; 
      p=0.0002), and ataxia confidence rating (1.72 [1.23-2.41]; p=0.0015) for SCA1; 
      age (1.08 [1.02-1.14]; p=0.0077) and CAG repeat length (1.65 [1.27-2.13]; 
      p=0.0001) for SCA2; and age (1.27 [1.09-1.50]; p=0.0031), confidence rating (2.60 
      [1.23-5.47]; p=0.012), and double vision (14.83 [2.15-102.44]; p=0.0063) for 
      SCA3. From the time of inclusion, the SARA scores of SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 
      mutation carriers increased, whereas they remained stable in non-carriers. On a 
      timescale defined by the predicted time of ataxia onset, SARA progression in 
      SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 mutation carriers was non-linear, with marginal progression 
      before ataxia and increasing progression after ataxia onset. INTERPRETATION: Our 
      study provides quantitative data on the conversion of non-ataxic SCA1, SCA2, and 
      SCA3 mutation carriers to manifest ataxia. Our data could prove useful for the 
      design of preventive trials aimed at delaying the onset of ataxia by aiding 
      sample size calculations and stratification of study participants. FUNDING:

LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddaa139 [doi]
AB  - The expanded HTT CAG repeat causing Huntington's disease (HD) exhibits somatic 
      expansion proposed to drive the rate of disease onset by eliciting a pathological 
      process that ultimately claims vulnerable cells. To gain insight into somatic 
      expansion in humans, we performed comprehensive quantitative analyses of CAG 
      expansion in ~50 central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral postmortem tissues 
      from seven adult-onset and one juvenile-onset HD individual. We also assessed 
      ATXN1 CAG repeat expansion in brain regions of an individual with a 
      neurologically and pathologically distinct repeat expansion disorder, 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). Our findings reveal similar profiles of 
      tissue instability in all HD individuals, which, notably, were also apparent in 
      the SCA1 individual. CAG expansion was observed in all tissues, but to different 
      degrees, with multiple cortical regions and neostriatum tending to have the 
      greatest instability in the CNS, and liver in the periphery. These patterns 
      indicate different propensities for CAG expansion contributed by disease 
      locus-independent trans-factors and demonstrate that expansion per se is not 
      sufficient to cause cell type or disease-specific pathology. Rather, pathology 
      may reflect distinct toxic processes triggered by different repeat lengths across 
      cell types and diseases. We also find that the HTT CAG length-dependent expansion 
      propensity of an individual is reflected in all tissues and in cerebrospinal 
      fluid. Our data indicate that peripheral cells may be a useful source to measure 
      CAG expansion in biomarker assays for therapeutic efforts, prompting efforts to 
      dissect underlying mechanisms of expansion that may differ between the brain and 
      periphery.

AB  - SAFB1 is a DNA and RNA binding protein that is highly expressed in the cerebellum 
      and hippocampus and is involved in the processing of coding and non-coding RNAs, 
      splicing and dendritic function. We analyzed SAFB1 expression in the post-mortem 
      brain tissue of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), Huntington's disease (HD), Multiple 
      sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease patients and controls. In SCA cases, the 
      expression of SAFB1 in the nucleus was increased and there was abnormal and 
      extensive expression in the cytoplasm where it co-localized with the markers of 
      Purkinje cell injury. Significantly, no SAFB1 expression was found in the 
      cerebellar neurons of the dentate nucleus in control or MS patients; however, in 
      SCA patients, SAFB1 expression was increased significantly in both the nucleus 
      and cytoplasm of dentate neurons. In HD, we found that SAFB1 expression was 
      increased in the nucleus and cytoplasm of striatal neurons; however, there was no 
      SAFB1 staining in the striatal neurons of controls. In PD substantia nigra, we 
      did not see any changes in neuronal SAFB1 expression. iCLIP analysis found that 
      SAFB1 crosslink sites within ATXN1 RNA were adjacent to the start and within the 
      glutamine repeat sequence. Further investigation found increased binding of SAFB1 
      to pathogenic ATXN1-85Q mRNA. These novel data strongly suggest SAFB1 contributes 
      to the etiology of SCA and Huntington's chorea and that it may be a pathological 
      marker of polyglutamine repeat expansion diseases.

AB  - Little is known about the genetic basis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 
      outside Europe and US. In this study, we investigated whether intermediate CAG 
      expansions at ATXN1 were associated to ALS in the Brazilian population. To 
      accomplish that, representative samples from 411 unrelated patients and 436 
      neurologically normal controls from 6 centers spread over the territory were 
      genotyped to quantify ATXN1 expansions. We found that ATXN1 intermediate-length 
      expansion (>/=34 CAG repeats) are associated with the disease (odds ratio...=...2.19, 
      95% CI...=...1.081-4.441, p...=....026). Most ATXN1-positive patients had classical 
      phenotype, but some of them presented predominant lower motor neuron involvement. 
      None of them had associated ataxia. Frontotemporal dementia was concomitantly 
      found in 12.5% of patients carrying the intermediate ATXN1 expansion. Further 
      studies are needed to validate these findings and to understand the 
      pathophysiological mechanisms that connect ataxin-1 and ALS.

TI  - Frequency and distribution of polyQ disease intermediate-length repeat alleles in 
      healthy Italian population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1-2-17 
      (SCA1-2-17) are adult-onset autosomal dominant diseases, caused by triplet repeat 
      expansions in the HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, and TBP genes. Alleles with a repeat number 
      just below the pathological threshold are associated with reduced penetrance and 
      meiotic instability and are defined as intermediate alleles (IAs). OBJECTIVES: We 
      aimed to determine the frequencies of IAs in healthy Italian subjects and to 
      compare the proportion of the IAs with the prevalence of the respective diseases. 
      METHODS: We analyzed the triplet repeat size in HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, and TBP genes 
      in the DNA samples from 729 consecutive adult healthy Italian subjects. RESULTS: 
      IAs associated with reduced penetrance were found in ATXN2 gene (1 subject, 0.1%) 
      and TBP gene (0.82%). IAs at risk for meiotic instability were found in HTT 
      (5.3%) and ATXN2 genes (2.7%). In ATXN1, we found a low percentage of IAs (0.4%). 
      Alleles lacking the common CAT interruption within the CAG sequence were also 
      rare (0.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The high frequencies of IAs in HTT and ATXN2 genes 
      suggest a correlation with the prevalence of the diseases in our population and 
      support the hypothesis that IAs could represent a reservoir of new pathological 
      expansions. On the opposite, ATXN1-IA were very rare in respect to the prevalence 
      of SCA1 in our country, and TBP- IA were more frequent than expected, suggesting 
      that other mechanisms could influence the occurrence of novel pathological 
      expansions.

AB  - We analyzed the frequency of intermediate alleles (IAs) in the ATXN1, ATXN2, and 
      HTT genes in several neurodegenerative diseases. The study included 1126 patients 
      with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 440 patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 
      and 610 patients with Parkinson's disease. In all cohorts, we genotyped ATXN1 and 
      ATXN2 CAG repeats. In addition, in the FTD cohort, we determined the number of 
      HTT CAG repeats. The frequency of HTT IAs was higher in patients with FTD (6.9%) 
      versus controls (2.9%) and in the C9orf72 expansion noncarriers (7.2%) versus 
      controls (2.9%), although the difference was nonsignificant after correction for 
      multiple testing. Compared with controls, progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) 
      groups showed a significantly higher frequency of HTT IAs (13.6% vs. 2.9% 
      controls). For the ATXN2 gene, we observed an increase in IA frequency in AD 
      cases (AD 4.1% vs. controls 1.8%) and in the behavioral FTD group (4.8% vs. 
      1.8%). For the ATXN1 gene, we found a significant increase of IAs in patients 
      with PNFA (18.6%) versus controls (6.7%). In conclusion, our work suggests that 
      the HTT and ATXN1 IAS may contribute to PNFA pathogenesis and point to a link 
      between ATXN2 IAS and AD.

AB  - Trinucleotide repeats are responsible for many genetic diseases. Previous studies 
      have shown that duplex RNAs (dsRNAs) can be used to target expression of a mutant 
      repeat allele while leaving expression of the wild-type allele untouched, 
      creating opportunities for allele-selective inhibition and better therapeutic 
      outcomes. In contrast to successes with other genes, we report here that we 
      cannot achieve allele-selective inhibition when targeting the expanded CAG repeat 
      within Ataxin-1 (ATXN1), the cause of spinal cerebellar ataxia-1 (SCA1). The most 
      likely explanation for this unfavorable outcome is that the mean CAG repeat 
      number within wild-type ATXN1 is relatively high compared to other trinucleotide 
      repeat diseases. Because the wild-type repeat number is high, it is likely that 
      there is poor discrimination between the mutant and wild-type repeat and less 
      opportunity for allele-selective inhibition across the entire spectrum of 
      mutations found in SCA1 patients. Our data support the conclusion that the 
      potential for multiple cooperative binding interactions is a critical factor 
      governing allele-selective recognition of trinucleotide repeat genes by duplex 
      RNAs. These results should be helpful in predicting which diseases and which 
      patients are most likely to benefit from allele-selective targeting of expanded 
      repeats.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) and type 1 (SCA1) are dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative disorders that are currently incurable. Both diseases are 
      caused by a CAG-repeat expansion in exon 10 of the Ataxin-3 and exon 8 of the 
      Ataxin-1 gene, respectively, encoding an elongated polyglutamine tract that 
      confers toxic properties to the resulting proteins. We have previously shown 
      lowering of the pathogenic polyglutamine protein in Huntington's disease mouse 
      models using (CUG)7, a CAG repeat-targeting antisense oligonucleotide. Here we 
      evaluated the therapeutic capacity of (CUG)7 for SCA3 and SCA1, in vitro in 
      patient-derived cell lines and in vivo in representative mouse models. Repeated 
      intracerebroventricular (CUG)7 administration resulted in a significant reduction 
      of mutant Ataxin-3 and Ataxin-1 proteins throughout the brain of SCA3 and SCA1 
      mouse models, respectively. Furthermore, in both a SCA3 patient cell line and the 
      MJD84.2 mouse model, (CUG)7 induced formation of a truncated Ataxin-3 protein 
      species lacking the polyglutamine stretch, likely arising from (CUG)7-mediated 
      exon 10 skipping. In contrast, skipping of exon 8 of Ataxin-1 did not 
      significantly contribute to the Ataxin-1 protein reduction observed in 
      (CUG)7-treated SCA1(154Q/2Q) mice. These findings support the therapeutic 
      potential of a single CAG repeat-targeting AON for the treatment of multiple 
      polyglutamine disorders.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the time and frequency domain measures of cardiac autonomic 
      activity/tone in patients of genetically defined spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 
      types 1 and 2, as well as to decipher the probable associations among the 
      cardiovascular autonomic parameters and genetic and clinical characteristics. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Simultaneous 5-min recording of RR interval (RRI) and 
      blood pressure (BP) for the calculation of heart rate variability (HRV), blood 
      pressure variability (BPV) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) were performed in 
      genotypically confirmed SCA1 (n = 31) and SCA2 (n = 40) patients and healthy 
      controls (n = 40). Additionally, the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating 
      Scale (ICARS) was used for scoring of clinical severity in SCA patients. RESULTS: 
      Time and frequency domain parameters of HRV, BPV and BRS were depressed in SCA1 
      and SCA2 subtypes as compared to controls, although there was no statistically 
      significant difference in autonomic tone between the two SCA subtypes. On 
      correlation analysis, autonomic tone parameters were found to be associated with 
      the clinical and genetic features of the SCA subtypes. Also, ICARS was associated 
      with the genotype (CAG repeat length) in SCA2 patents. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac 
      autonomic tone is depressed in both SCA1 and 2 as compared to healthy controls 
      while the two SCA subtypes do not differ in terms of autonomic tone. Also, a 
      typical association exists between disease characteristics and autonomic indices.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1 (SCA1) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder 
      that is characterized by worsening of disordered coordination, ataxia of the 
      trunk, and other neurological symptoms. Physical activity improves both mobility 
      and the daily living activities of patients with SCA. Intervention with daily 
      regular treadmill exercise may slow the deterioration of cerebellar neurons in 
      SCA1. Therefore, the signal changes and performance of cerebellar neurons after 
      exercise in SCA1 was investigated in this study. We employed a transgenic mouse 
      model of SCA1, generated by amplifying the cytosine-adenine-guanine trinucleotide 
      repeat expansions, and the mice underwent 1 month of moderate daily treadmill 
      exercise for 1 hour. The rotarod test revealed that the motor function of the 
      SCA1 mice that underwent training was superior to that of the control SCA1 mice, 
      which did not undergo training. Moreover, the cerebellar pathology revealed 
      preserved Purkinje neurons stained by carbindin with an increase of the neuronal 
      Per Arnt Sim domain protein 4, a key regulation in the structural and functional 
      plasticity of neurons, in the excised SCA1 mice relative to the controls. The 
      mechanism was related to an increase of phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, 
      a downstream target of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway, but not to 
      autophagy activation. This study determined that regular treadmill exercise may 
      play a crucial role in the viable support of cerebellar neurons in SCA1.

TI  - (CAG)(n) loci as genetic modifiers of age at onset in patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 from mainland China.
PG  - 1130-1136
LID - 10.1111/ene.13954 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The expanded repeat length in ATXN1 negatively correlates 
      with age at onset (AAO) of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) but can explain 
      only part of it, indicating that other factors affect AAO. Some studies have 
      explored the influence of non-causative CAG repeats on the AAO of SCA patients. 
      However, studies on Chinese SCA1 patients regarding candidate modifier factors 
      involved in the variability in AAO are rare. METHODS: In all, 152 Chinese SCA1 
      patients who were genotyped for ATXN1 and nine other (CAG)(n) -containing genes 
      were enrolled. Regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of the 
      expanded allele of ATXN1 (linear and quadratic effects) on AAO. Then, different 
      models were used to explore the modulatory effect of nine other (CAG)(n) 
      -containing genes. RESULTS: Our results verified the negative effect of the 
      expanded allele in ATXN1 by regression analysis. Some (CAG)(n) -containing genes 
      including TBP, ATN1 and HTT modified AAO with variance ranging from 0.8% to 3.8% 
      and tended to decrease or delay AAO. However, no modifier effects of ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, KCNN3, RAI1 and normal ATXN1 alleles in trans were 
      detected. CONCLUSION: By using interaction analyses, TBP, ATN1 and HTT were 
      determined to have modifying effects. Our study revealed that differences in 
      modulation may be due to ethnic and geographic diversity across different 
      populations. Furthermore, the variability of AAO was not completely explained by 
      the genetic modifiers examined here, suggesting that other genetic or 
      environmental factors are involved in these diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) caused by pathogenic CAG repeat 
      expansion in the ATXN1 is characterized by loss of vision with little fundus 
      abnormalities in some patients. Recently, macular degeneration has been reported 
      to account for the visual symptoms in sporadic cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five 
      consecutive patients diagnosed as SCA1 with supporting genetical evidence were 
      newly referred to ophthalmology department from neurology unit. They underwent 
      ocular examination to assess visual acuity and the structural integrity of the 
      macula using optical coherent tomography (OCT). Full-field and multifocal 
      electroretinogram (ERG) were recorded in some patients. Genetic testing was done 
      by a polymerase chain reaction-based method. RESULTS: Fundus examinations 
      revealed normal optic disc and macula appearance. However, four out of five 
      patients had foveal thinning by OCT. This included three patients who showed 
      reduced visual acuity. Among the three, multifocal ERG was performed in two, 
      which showed reduced amplitudes in the localized foveal area. Full-field ERG 
      showed normal responses in all five patients assessed. Only one patient had 
      normal visual function and normal macular structure. CONCLUSIONS: Macular 
      degeneration with subtle funduscopic alterations, sometimes mimicking occult 
      macular dystrophy, is an important cause of visual loss in SCA1 patients, which 
      could be reliably detected with OCT and multifocal ERGs.

TI  - Large normal alleles of ATXN2 decrease age at onset in transthyretin familial 
      amyloid polyneuropathy Val30Met patients.
PG  - 251-258
LID - 10.1002/ana.25409 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Transthyretin (TTR)-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is 
      an autosomal dominant neurological disease, caused most frequently by a Val30Met 
      (now classified as Val50Met) substitution in TTR. Age at onset (AO) ranges from 
      19 to 82 years, and variability exists mostly between generations. Unstable 
      oligonucleotide repeats in various genes are the mechanism behind several 
      neurological diseases, found also to act as modifiers for other disorders. Our 
      aim was to investigate whether large normal repeat alleles of 10 genes had a 
      possible modifier effect in AO in Portuguese TTR-FAP Val30Met families. METHODS: 
      We analyzed 329 Portuguese patients from 123 families. Repeat length (at ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, TBP, ATN1, HTT, JPH3, AR, and DMPK) was assessed by single 
      and multiplex polymerase chain reaction, using fluorescently labeled primers, 
      followed by capillary electrophoresis. We used a family-centered approach, and 
      generalized estimating equations were used to account for AO correlation between 
      family members. RESULTS: For ATXN2, the presence of at least 1 allele longer than 
      22 CAGs was significantly associated with an earlier onset in TTR-FAP Val30Met, 
      decreasing mean AO by 6 years (95% confidence interval = -8.81 to -2.19, p = 
      0.001). No association was found for the remaining repeat loci. INTERPRETATION: 
      Length of normal repeats at ATXN2 may modify AO in TTR-FAP Val30Met and may 
      function as a risk factor. This can be due to the role of ATXN2 in RNA metabolism 
      and as a modulator of various cellular processes, including mitochondrial stress. 
      This may have relevant implications for prognosis and the follow-up of 
      presymptomatic carriers. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:251-258.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to reappraise the progression of the five 
      most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) in the Chinese population and to 
      establish a much-needed critical comparison with that in other ethnic groups. 
      There are very few longitudinal cohort studies of SCAs in Asian populations. An 
      intriguing finding in an earlier study demonstrated a faster progression of SCA 
      among Chinese than that among Caucasians. METHODS: Patients with SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, SCA6 or SCA17 were consecutively assessed using the scale for the 
      assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA) for five years. A linear mixed model was 
      used to compare the annual progression rates measured using the SARA among 
      patients with different SCA subtypes. Predictors of the progression rates were 
      analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 199 patients with SCA (10 with SCA1, 37 with SCA2, 
      118 with SCA3, 25 with SCA6 and 9 with SCA17) were enrolled. The mean annual 
      increase in SARA scores was 1.23 points for SCA1, 1.52 points for SCA2, 1.60 
      points for SCA3, 0.99 points for SCA6 and 3.26 points for SCA17. A larger CAG 
      repeat length (>/=74) was associated with faster progression in SCA3, whereas a 
      lower total SARA score at the first visit (<12) was associated with faster 
      clinical progression in SCA6. CONCLUSION: The results of this study confirm that 
      the annual progression rates of SCA2 and SCA3 are comparable between Han Chinese 
      and other ethnic populations. More studies are warranted to confirm the rapid 
      progression of SCA17 observed in our cohort.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is a rare autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the TATA-box 
      binding protein gene (TBP). The disease has a varied age at onset and clinical 
      presentation. It is distinct from other SCAs for its association with dementia, 
      psychiatric symptoms, and some patients presenting with chorea. For this reason, 
      it is also called Huntington's disease-like 4 (HDL-4). Here we examine the 
      distribution of SCA17 allele repeat sizes in a United Kingdom-based cohort with 
      ataxia and find that fully penetrant pathogenic alleles are very rare (5 in 1,316 
      chromosomes; 0.38%). Phenotype-genotype correlation was performed on 30 
      individuals and the repeat structure of their TBP genes was examined. We found a 
      negative linear correlation between total CAG repeat length and age at disease 
      onset and, unlike SCA1, there was no correlation between the longest contiguous 
      CAG tract and age at disease onset. We were unable to identify any particular 
      phenotypic trait that segregated with particular CAG/CAA repeat tract structures 
      or repeat lengths. One individual within the cohort was homozygous for variable 
      penetrance range SCA17 alleles. This patient had a similar age at onset to 
      heterozygotes with the same repeat sizes, but also presented with a rapidly 
      progressive dementia. A pair of monozygotic twins within the cohort presented 3 
      years apart with the sibling with the earlier onset having a more severe 
      phenotype with dementia and chorea in addition to the ataxia observed in their 
      twin. This appears to be a case of variable expressivity, possibly influenced by 
      other environmental or epigenetic factors. Finally, there was an asymptomatic 
      father with a severely affected child with an age at onset in their twenties. 
      Despite this, they share the same expanded allele repeat sizes and sequences, 
      which would suggest that there is marked difference in the penetrance of this 
      51-repeat allele. We therefore propose that the variable penetrance range extend 
      from 48 repeats to incorporate this allele. This study shows that there is 
      variability in the presentation and penetrance of the SCA17 phenotype and 
      highlights the complexity of this disorder.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in ATXN1, characterized by progressive cerebellar and 
      extracerebellar symptoms. MRI-based studies in SCA1 focused in the cerebellum and 
      connections, but there are few data about supratentorial/spinal damage and its 
      clinical relevance. We have thus designed this multimodal MRI study to uncover 
      the structural signature of SCA1. To accomplish that, a group of 33 patients and 
      33 age-and gender-matched healthy controls underwent MRI on a 3T scanner. All 
      patients underwent a comprehensive neurological and neuropsychological 
      evaluation. We correlated the structural findings with the clinical features of 
      the disease. In addition, we evaluated the disease progression looking at 
      differences in SCA1 subgroups defined by disease duration. Ataxia and pyramidal 
      signs were the main symptoms. Neuropsychological evaluation disclosed cognitive 
      impairment in 53% with predominant frontotemporal dysfunction. Gray matter 
      analysis unfolded cortical thinning of primary and associative motor areas with 
      more restricted impairment of deep structures. Deep gray matter atrophy was 
      associated with motor handicap and poor cognition skills. White matter integrity 
      loss was diffuse in the brainstem but restricted in supratentorial structures. 
      Cerebellar cortical thinning was found in multiple areas and correlated not only 
      with motor disability but also with verbal fluency. Spinal cord atrophy 
      correlated with motor handicap. Comparison of MRI findings in disease 
      duration-defined subgroups identified a peculiar pattern of progressive 
      degeneration.

AB  - Genomewide association studies (GWASs) have contributed greatly to unraveling the 
      genetic basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a large amount of "missing 
      heritability" remains. In this exploratory study, we investigated the effect of 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in polyglutamine disease-associated genes 
      (PDAGs) on the risk of AD and its expression. In a cohort of 959 patients 
      diagnosed with AD (Amsterdam Dementia cohort) and 4106 cognitively healthy 
      participants (Leiden 85-plus Study and the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in 
      the Elderly at Risk), we determined the CAG repeat sequences in ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, HTT, ATN1, and AR. We did not find a significant 
      association between the risk of AD and variations in CAG repeat numbers of PDAGs. 
      However, we found that differences in CAG repeat numbers in ATXN1, ATXN2, and AR 
      were significantly associated with several clinical and imaging features in AD 
      patients. Specifically, the association between memory performance in patients 
      with AD and the CAG repeat size in the longer ATXN1 allele, and the association 
      between atrophy in the medial temporal lobes and the CAG repeat number in the 
      longer AR allele remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Our 
      findings suggest that repeat polymorphisms in ATXN1 and AR can act as important 
      genetic modifiers of AD, warranting further scrutiny of their role in its missing 
      heritability and pathogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The worldwide prevalence of obesity, a major risk factor for numerous 
      debilitating chronic disorders, is increasing rapidly. Although a substantial 
      amount of the variation in body mass index (BMI) is estimated to be heritable, 
      the largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to date 
      explained only ~2.7% of the variation. To tackle this 'missing heritability' 
      problem of obesity, here we focused on the contribution of DNA repeat length 
      polymorphisms which are not detectable by GWAS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We 
      determined the cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat length in the nine known 
      polyglutamine disease-associated genes (ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, 
      HTT, ATN1 and AR) in two large cohorts consisting of 12,457 individuals and 
      analyzed their association with BMI, using generalized linear mixed-effect 
      models. RESULTS: We found a significant association between BMI and the length of 
      CAG repeats in seven polyglutamine disease-associated genes (including ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP and AR). Importantly, these repeat variations 
      could account for 0.75% of the total BMI variation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      incriminate repeat polymorphisms as an important novel class of genetic risk 
      factors of obesity and highlight the role of the brain in its pathophysiology.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by an expansion of a polyglutamine tract within the ATXN1 gene. 
      Normal alleles have been reported to range from 6 to 35 repeats, intermediate 
      alleles from 36 to 38 repeats and fully penetrant pathogenic alleles have at 
      least 39 repeats. This distribution was based on relatively few samples and the 
      narrow intermediate range makes the accuracy of the repeat sizing crucial for 
      interpreting and reporting diagnostic tests, which can vary between laboratories. 
      Here, we examine the distribution of 6378 SCA1 chromosomes and identify a very 
      late onset SCA1 family with a fully penetrant uninterrupted pathogenic allele 
      containing 38 repeats. This finding supports the theory that polyQ toxicity is 
      related to the increase of the length of the inherited tracts and not as 
      previously hypothesized to the structural transition occurring above a specific 
      threshold. In addition, the threshold of toxicity shifts to a shorter polyQ 
      length with the increase of the lifespan in SCA1. Furthermore, we show that SCA1 
      intermediate alleles have a different behavior compared to the other 
      polyglutamine disorders as they do not show reduced penetrance when 
      uninterrupted. Therefore, the pathogenic mechanism in SCA1 is distinct from other 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat disorders. Accurately sizing repeats is 
      paramount in precision medicine and can be challenging particularly with 
      borderline alleles. We examined plasmids containing cloned CAG repeat tracts 
      alongside a triplet repeat primed polymerase chain reaction (TP PCR) CAG repeat 
      ladder to improve accuracy in repeat sizing by fragment analysis. This method 
      accurately sizes the repeats irrespective of repeat composition or length. We 
      also improved the model for calculating repeat length from fragment analysis 
      sizing by fragment analyzing 100 cloned repeats of known size. Therefore, we 
      recommend these methods for accurately sizing repeat lengths and restriction 
      enzyme digestion to identify interruptions for interpretation of a given allele's 
      pathogenicity.

TI  - Long-term evolution of patient-reported outcome measures in spinocerebellar 
      ataxias.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To study the long-term evolution of patient-reported outcome 
      measures (PROMs) in the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), we analyzed 
      8 years follow-up data of the EUROSCA Natural History Study, a cohort study of 
      526 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6. METHODS: To assess the functional 
      capacity in daily living, we used the functional assessment (part IV) of the 
      Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS-IV), for health-related quality 
      of life the visual analogue scale of the EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire 
      (EQ-5D VAS), and for depressive symptoms the Patient Health Questionnaire 
      (PHQ-9). Severity of ataxia was assessed using the Scale for the Assessment and 
      Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and neurological symptoms other than ataxia with the 
      Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS). RESULTS: UHDRS-IV [SCA1: - 1.35 (0.12); 
      SCA2: - 1.15 (0.11); SCA3: - 1.16 (0.11); SCA6: - 0.99 (0.12)] and EQ-5D [SCA1: 
      - 2.88 (0.72); SCA2: - 1.97 (0.49); SCA3: - 2.06 (0.55); SCA6: - 1.03 (0.57)] 
      decreased linearly, whereas PHQ-9 increased [SCA1: 0.15 (0.04); SCA2: 0.09 
      (0.03); SCA3: 0.06 (0.04); SCA6: 0.07 (0.04)] during the observational period. 
      Standard response means (SRMs) of UHDRS-IV (0.473-0.707) and EQ-5D VAS 
      (0.053-0.184) were lower than that of SARA (0.404-0.979). In SCA1, higher SARA 
      scores [- 0.0288 (0.01), p = 0.0251], longer repeat expansions [- 0.0622 (0.02), 
      p = 0.0002] and the presence of cognitive impairment at baseline [- 0.5381 
      (0.25), p = 0.0365] were associated with faster UHDRS-IV decline. In SCA3, higher 
      INAS counts were associated with a faster UHDRS-IV decline [- 0.05 (0.02), 
      p = 0.0212]. In SCA1, PHQ-9 progression was faster in patients with cognitive 
      impairment [0.14 (0.07); p = 0.0396]. CONCLUSIONS: In the common SCAs, PROMs give 
      complementary information to the information provided by neurological scales. 
      This underlines the importance of PROMs as additional outcome measures in future 
      interventional trials.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a group of genetic diseases of the nervous system 
      with genetic and clinical heterogeneity. SCA is often caused by an expanded CAG 
      repeat sequence in the encoding protein. Genetic testing is necessary to diagnose 
      and classify the types of SCA. Next...generation DNA sequencing usually generates a 
      high error rate for insertion or deletion mutations, so it is unhelpful for 
      classifying the types of SCA. In the present study, a Chinese SCA pedigree was 
      preliminarily diagnosed with SCA1 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      amplification. The propositus and his three younger siblings were diagnosed with 
      SCA1 as a result of the identification of the length of the expanded CAG repeat 
      sequence in the ATXN1 gene performed using Sanger sequencing. The current study 
      presents a convenient and efficient method to identify causative mutations for 
      polyglutamine SCA using PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing.

TI  - Serum neurofilament light is increased in multiple system atrophy of cerebellar 
      type and in repeat-expansion spinocerebellar ataxias: a pilot study.
PG  - 1618-1624
LID - 10.1007/s00415-018-8893-9 [doi]
AB  - Blood biomarkers in degenerative ataxias are still largely missing. Here, we 
      aimed to provide piloting proof-of-concept that serum Neurofilament light (NfL) 
      could offer a promising peripheral blood biomarker in degenerative ataxias. 
      Specifically, as a marker of neuronal damage, NfL might (1) help to differentiate 
      multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type (MSA-C) from sporadic adult-onset 
      ataxia (SAOA), and (2) show increases in repeat-expansion spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs) which might be amenable to treatment in the future. To explore these two 
      hypotheses, we measured serum NfL levels by single-molecule array (Simoa) 
      technique in 115 subjects, comprising patients with MSA-C (n = 25), SAOA 
      (n = 25), the most frequent repeat-expansion SCAs (SCA 1, 2, 3 and 6) (n = 20), 
      and age-matched controls (n = 45). Compared to controls, NfL was significantly 
      increased in MSA-C, with levels significantly higher than in SAOA (AUC = 0.74 
      (0.59-0.89), mean and 95% confidence interval, p = .004). NfL was also 
      significantly increased in SCA patients as compared to controls (AUC = 0.91 
      (0.81-1.00), p < .001), including NfL increases in SCA1 and SCA3. These findings 
      provide first proof-of-concept that NfL might provide a promising peripheral 
      biomarker in degenerative ataxias, e.g. supporting the differentiation of MSA-C 
      from SAOA, and indicating neuronal damage in repeat-expansion SCAs.

AB  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an adult onset, progressive, neurodegenerative 
      disorder of unknown etiology characterized by autonomic dysfunction, parkinsonism 
      (MSA-P) and cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C). The phenotypic spectrum may present 
      overlapping features with other neurodegenerative diseases, particularly the 
      autosomal dominant inherited polyglutamine disorders. To investigate the possible 
      contribution of CAG expansions in the MSA phenotype, we analyzed the triplet 
      repeat length in the autosomal dominant causative genes for spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) type 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 17, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) 
      and Huntington disease (HD) in a cohort of 246 Italian MSA patients. As 
      comparison, 223 controls were also analyzed. The alleles were classified on the 
      basis of CAG repeat length as "normal", "intermediate" or "expanded" according to 
      literature. The MSA patients (101 men/145 women) had a mean age at onset of 58 
      years and a mean age at genetic testing of 63 years. MSA-C patients had 
      significantly younger age at onset and at examination in comparison to MSA-P 
      (p...<...0.0001). We identified a SCA1 intermediate allele in a MSA-C subject (36 
      CAG), a SCA2 intermediate allele in a MSA-P patient (31 CAG), and a 
      pathologically expanded SCA2 allele (36 CAG) in a patient initially misdiagnosed 
      as MSA-C. No intermediate or expanded SCA alleles were detected in controls. The 
      distribution of CAG repeat length was similar among groups except for SCA1 gene 
      that showed a higher percentage of longer normal alleles in MSA-C as compared to 
      MSA-P and controls (p...<...0.0001). This study supports the utility of polyQ genetic 
      testing in the differential diagnosis of MSA, and may suggest a possible role of 
      SCA1 repeat length as risk factor for MSA-C. SCA1 and SCA2 genetic screening is 
      recommended in MSA Italian patients.

TI  - Genetic testing for clinically suspected spinocerebellar ataxias: report from a 
      tertiary referral centre in India.
PG  - 219-224
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      syndromes, characterized by a wide range of muscular weakness and motor deficits, 
      caused due to cerebellar degeneration. The prevalence of the syndromes of SCA 
      varies across the world and is known to be linked to the instability of 
      trinucleotide repeats within the high-end normal alleles, along with susceptible 
      haplotype. We estimated sizes of the CAG or GAA repeat expansions at the SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA12 and frataxin loci among 864 referrals of subjects to genetic 
      counselling and testing (GCAT) clinic, National Institute of Mental Health and 
      Neurosciences, Bengaluru, India, with suspected SCA. The most frequent mutations 
      detected were SCA1 (n = 100 (11.6%)) and SCA2 (n = 98 (11.3%)) followed by SCA3 
      (n = 40 (4.6%)), FRDA (n = 20 (2.3%)) and SCA12 (n = 8 (0.9%)).

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 8 of the ATXN1 gene. We generated 
      induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from a SCA1 patient and his non-affected 
      sister by using non-integrating Sendai Viruses (SeV). The resulting hiPSCs are 
      SeVfree, express pluripotency markers, display a normal karyotype, retain the 
      mutation (length of the CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN1 gene) and are able to 
      differentiate into the three germ layers in vitro.

TI  - Survival in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, and 6 (EUROSCA): 
      a longitudinal cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias are dominantly inherited progressive ataxia 
      disorders that can lead to premature death. We aimed to study the overall 
      survival of patients with the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, and SCA6) and to identify the strongest contributing predictors that affect 
      survival. METHODS: In this longitudinal cohort study (EUROSCA), we enrolled men 
      and women, aged 18 years or older, from 17 ataxia referral centres in ten 
      European countries; participants had positive genetic test results for SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 and progressive, otherwise unexplained, ataxias. Survival was 
      defined as the time from enrolment to death for any reason. We used the Cox 
      regression model adjusted for age at baseline to analyse survival. We used 
      prognostic factors with a p value less than 0.05 from a multivariate model to 
      build nomograms and assessed their performance based on discrimination and 
      calibration. The EUROSCA study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
      NCT02440763. FINDINGS: Between July 1, 2005, and Aug 31, 2006, 525 patients with 
      SCA1 (n=117), SCA2 (n=162), SCA3 (n=139), or SCA6 (n=107) were enrolled and 
      followed up. The 10-year survival rate was 57% (95% CI 47-69) for SCA1, 74% 
      (67-81) for SCA2, 73% (65-82) for SCA3, and 87% (80-94) for SCA6. Factors 
      associated with shorter survival were: dysphagia (hazard ratio 4.52, 95% CI 
      1.83-11.15) and a higher value for the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of 
      Ataxia (SARA) score (1.26, 1.19-1.33) for patients with SCA1; older age at 
      inclusion (1.04, 1.01-1.08), longer CAG repeat length (1.16, 1.03-1.31), and 
      higher SARA score (1.15, 1.10-1.20) for patients with SCA2; older age at 
      inclusion (1.44, 1.20-1.74), dystonia (2.65, 1.21-5.53), higher SARA score (1.26, 
      1.17-1.35), and negative interaction between CAG and age at inclusion (0.994, 
      0.991-0.997) for patients with SCA3; and higher SARA score (1.17, 1.08-1.27) for 
      patients with SCA6. The nomogram-predicted probability of 10-year survival showed 
      good discrimination (c index 0.905 [SD 0.027] for SCA1, 0.822 [0.032] for SCA2, 
      0.891 [0.021] for SCA3, and 0.825 [0.054] for SCA6). INTERPRETATION: Our study 
      provides quantitative data on the survival of patients with the most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, based on a long follow-up period. These results have 
      implications for the design of future interventional studies of spinocerebellar 
      ataxias; for example, the prognostic survival nomogram could be useful for 
      selection and stratification of patients. Our findings need validation in an 
      external population before they can be used to counsel patients and their 
      families. FUNDING: European Union 6th Framework programme, German Ministry of

AB  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a complex and multifactorial neurodegenerative 
      disease, and its pathogenesis remains uncertain. Patients with MSA or 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) show overlapping clinical phenotypes. Previous 
      studies have reported that intermediate or long CAG expansions in SCA genes have 
      been associated with other neurodegenerative disease. In this study, we screened 
      for the number of CAG repeats in ATXN1, 2 and 3 in 200 patients with MSA and 314 
      healthy controls to evaluate possible associations between (CAG)(n) in these 
      three polyQ-related genes and MSA. Our findings indicated that longer repeat 
      lengths in ATXN2 were associated with increased risk for MSA in Chinese 
      individuals. No relationship was observed between CAG repeat length in the three 
      examined genes and age at onset (AO) of MSA.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7, associated with a (CAG)(n) 
      repeat expansion in coding sequences, are the most prevalent autosomal dominant 
      ataxias worldwide (approximately 60% of the cases). In addition, the phenotype of 
      SCA2 expansions has been now extended to Parkinson disease and amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis. Their diagnosis is currently based on a PCR to identify small 
      expanded alleles, followed by a second-level test whenever a false normal 
      homozygous or a CAT interruption in SCA1 needs to be verified. Next-generation 
      sequencing still does not allow efficient detection of these repeats. Here, we 
      show the efficacy of a novel, rapid, and cost-effective method to identify and 
      size pathogenic expansions in SCA1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 and recognize large alleles or 
      interruptions without a second-level test. Twenty-five healthy controls and 33 
      expansion carriers were analyzed: alleles migrated consistently in different PCRs 
      and capillary runs, and homozygous individuals were always distinguishable from 
      heterozygous carriers of both common and large (>100 repeats) pathogenic CAG 
      expansions. Repeat number could be calculated counting the number of peaks, 
      except for the largest SCA2 and SCA7 alleles. Interruptions in SCA1 were always 
      visible. Overall, our method allows a simpler, cost-effective, and sensibly 
      faster SCA diagnostic protocol compared with the standard technique and to the 
      still unadapted next-generation sequencing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) subtypes are often caused by expansions 
      in non-coding regions of genes like SCA8, SCA10, SCA12 and SCA36. Other ataxias 
      are known to be associated with repeat expansions such as fragile X-associated 
      tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) or expansions in the C9orf72 gene. When no 
      mutation has been identified in the aforementioned genes next-generation 
      sequencing (NGS)-based diagnostics may also be applied. In order to define an 
      optimal diagnostic strategy, more information about the frequency and phenotypic 
      characteristics of rare repeat expansion disorders associated with ataxia should 
      be at hand. METHODS: We analyzed a consecutive cohort of 440 German unrelated 
      patients with symptoms of cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria and other unspecific 
      symptoms who were referred to our center for SCA diagnostics. They showed alleles 
      in the normal range for the most common SCA subtypes SCA1-3, SCA6, SCA7 and 
      SCA17. These patients were screened for expansions causing SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA36 and FXTAS as well as for the pathogenic hexanucleotide repeat in the 
      C9orf72 gene. RESULTS: Expanded repeats for SCA10, SCA12 or SCA36 were not 
      identified in the analyzed patients. Five patients showed expanded SCA8 CTA/CTG 
      alleles with 92-129 repeats. One 51-year-old male with unclear dementia symptoms 
      was diagnosed with a large GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72. The analysis of 
      the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) revealed one patient with a 
      premutation (>50 CGG repeats) and seven patients with alleles in the grey zone 
      (41 to 54 CGG repeats). CONCLUSIONS: Altogether five patients showed 92 or more 
      SCA8 CTA/CTG combined repeats. Our results support the assumption that smaller 
      FMR1 gene expansions could be associated with the risk of developing neurological 
      signs. The results do not support genetic testing for C9orf72 expansion in ataxia 
      patients.

AB  - To clarify the possible involvement of intermediate ATXN1 alleles as risk factors 
      for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we tested ATXN1 in a cohort of 1146 
      Italian ALS patients, previously screened for variants in other ALS genes, and in 
      529 controls. We detected ATXN1 alleles with >/=33 polyglutamine repeats in 105 of 
      1146 patients (9.16%) and 29 of 529 controls (5.48%) (p = 0.003). The frequency 
      of ATXN1 alleles with >/=33 polyglutamine repeats was particularly high in the 
      group of ALS patients carrying the C9orf72 expansion (12/59, 20.3%). We confirmed 
      this result in an independent cohort of C9orf72 Italian patients (10/80 cases, 
      12.5%), thus finding a cumulative frequency of ATXN1 expansion of 15.82% in 
      C9orf72 carriers (p = 2.40E-05). Our results strongly support the hypothesis that 
      ATXN1 could act as a disease risk gene in ALS, mostly in C9orf72 expansion 
      carriers. Further studies are needed to confirm our results and to define the 
      mechanism by which ATXN1 might contribute to neuronal degeneration leading to 
      ALS.

AB  - Cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansions in the coding regions of nine 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) genes (HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATN1, AR, 
      and TBP) are the cause of several neurodegenerative diseases including 
      Huntington's disease (HD), six different spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. The 
      expanded CAG repeat length in the causative gene is negatively related to the 
      age-at-onset (AAO) of clinical symptoms. In addition to the expanded CAG repeat 
      length in the causative gene, the normal CAG repeats in the other polyQ genes can 
      affect the AAO, suggesting functional interactions between the polyQ genes. 
      However, there is no detailed assessment of the relationships among polyQ genes 
      in pathologically relevant brain regions. We used gene co-expression analysis to 
      study the functional relationships among polyQ genes in different brain regions 
      using the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), a spatial map of gene expression in the 
      healthy brain. We constructed co-expression networks for seven anatomical brain 
      structures, as well as a region showing a specific pattern of atrophy in HD 
      patients detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. In this 
      HD-associated region, we found that ATN1 and ATXN2 were co-expressed and shared 
      co-expression partners which were enriched for DNA repair genes. We observed a 
      similar co-expression pattern in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and striatum in 
      which this relation was most pronounced. Given that the co-expression patterns 
      for these anatomical structures were similar to those for the HD-associated 
      region, our results suggest that their disruption is likely involved in HD 
      pathology. Moreover, ATN1 and ATXN2 also shared many co-expressed genes with HTT, 
      the causative gene of HD, across the brain. Although this triangular relationship 
      among these three polyQ genes may also be dysregulated in other polyQ diseases, 
      stronger co-expression patterns between ATN1 and ATXN2 observed in the 
      HD-associated region, especially in the striatum, may be more specific to HD.

TI  - Postural Tremor and Ataxia Progression in Spinocerebellar Ataxias.
PG  - 492

LID - 492
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postural tremor can sometimes occur in spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs). However, the prevalence and clinical characteristics of postural tremor 
      in SCAs are poorly understood, and whether SCA patients with postural tremor have 
      different ataxia progression is not known. METHODS: We studied postural tremor in 
      315 patients with SCA1, 2, 3, and 6 recruited from the Clinical Research 
      Consortium for Spinocerebellar Ataxias (CRC-SCA), which consists of 12 
      participating centers in the United States, and we evaluated ataxia progression 
      in these patients from January 2010 to August 2012. RESULTS: Among 315 SCA 
      patients, postural tremor was most common in SCA2 patients (SCA1, 5.8%; SCA2, 
      27.5%; SCA3, 12.4%; SCA6, 16.9%; p = 0.007). SCA3 patients with postural tremor 
      had longer CAG repeat expansions than SCA3 patients without postural tremor 
      (73.67 +/- 3.12 vs. 70.42 +/- 3.96, p = 0.003). Interestingly, SCA1 and SCA6 patients 
      with postural tremor had a slower rate of ataxia progression (SCA1, beta = -0.91, p 
      < 0.001; SCA6, beta = -1.28, p = 0.025), while SCA2 patients with postural tremor 
      had a faster rate of ataxia progression (beta = 1.54, p = 0.034). We also found that 
      the presence of postural tremor in SCA2 patients could be influenced by repeat 
      expansions of ATXN1 (beta = -1.53, p = 0.037) and ATXN3 (beta = 0.57, p = 0.018), 
      whereas postural tremor in SCA3 was associated with repeat lengths in TBP (beta = 
      0.63, p = 0.041) and PPP2R2B (beta = -0.40, p = 0.032). DISCUSSION: Postural tremor 
      could be a clinical feature of SCAs, and the presence of postural tremor could be 
      associated with different rates of ataxia progression. Genetic interactions 
      between ataxia genes might influence the brain circuitry and thus affect the 
      clinical presentation of postural tremor.

TI  - Genetic Screening for Spinocerebellar Ataxia Genes in a Japanese Single-Hospital 
      Cohort.
PG  - 116-122
LID - 10.14802/jmd.17011 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diagnosis of sporadic cerebellar ataxia is a challenge for 
      neurologists. A wide range of potential causes exist, including chronic alcohol 
      use, multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type (MSA-C), and sporadic late 
      cortical cerebellar atrophy. Recently, an autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) mutation was identified in a cohort of patients with non-MSA-C 
      sporadic cerebellar ataxia. The aim of this study is to genetically screen genes 
      involved in SCA in a Japanese single-hospital cohort. METHODS: Over an 8-year 
      period, 140 patients with cerebellar ataxia were observed. There were 109 
      patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia (no family history for at least four 
      generations, 73 patients with MSA-C, and 36 patients with non-MSA-C sporadic 
      cerebellar ataxia) and 31 patients with familial cerebellar ataxia. We performed 
      gene analysis comprising SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 17, 31, and 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) in 28 of 31 non-MSA-C sporadic 
      patients who requested the test. Familial patients served as a control. RESULTS: 
      Gene abnormalities were found in 57% of non-MSA-C sporadic cerebellar ataxia 
      cases. Among patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia, abnormalities in SCA6 were 
      the most common (36%), followed by abnormalities in SCA1 (7.1%), SCA2 (3.6%), 
      SCA3 (3.6%), SCA8 (3.6%), and DRPLA (3.6%). In contrast, gene abnormalities were 
      found in 75% of familial cerebellar ataxia cases, with abnormalities in SCA6 
      being the most common (29%). For sporadic versus familial cases for those with 
      SCA6 abnormalities, the age of onset was older (69 years vs. 59 years, 
      respectively), and CAG repeat length was shorter (23 vs. 25, respectively) in the 
      former than in the latter (not statistically significant). CONCLUSION: 
      Autosomal-dominant mutations in SCA genes, particularly in SCA6, are not rare in 
      sporadic cerebellar ataxia. The reason for the frequency of mutations in SCA6 
      remains unclear; however, the reason may reflect a higher age at onset and 
      variable penetrance of SCA6 mutations.

TI  - Large normal-range TBP and ATXN7 CAG repeat lengths are associated with increased 
      lifetime risk of depression.

AB  - Depression is one of the most prevalent and debilitating psychiatric disorders 
      worldwide. Recently, we showed that both relatively short and relatively long 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in the huntingtin gene (HTT) are 
      associated with an increased risk of lifetime depression. However, to what extent 
      the variations in CAG repeat length in the other eight polyglutamine 
      disease-associated genes (PDAGs) are associated with depression is still unknown. 
      We determined the CAG repeat sizes of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, 
      ATN1 and AR in two well-characterized Dutch cohorts-the Netherlands Study of 
      Depression and Anxiety and the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older 
      Persons-including 2165 depressed and 1058 non-depressed individuals-aged 18-93 
      years. The association between PDAG CAG repeat size and the risk for depression 
      was assessed via binary logistic regression. We found that the odds ratio (OR) 
      for lifetime depression was significantly higher for individuals with >10, 
      compared with subjects with </=10, CAG repeats in both ATXN7 alleles (OR=1.90, 
      confidence interval (CI) 1.26-2.85). For TBP we found a similar association: A 
      CAG repeat length exceeding the median in both alleles was associated with an 
      increased risk for lifetime depression (OR=1.33, CI 1.00-1.76). In conclusion, we 
      observed that carriers of either ATXN7 or TBP alleles with relatively large CAG 
      repeat sizes in both alleles had a substantially increased risk of lifetime 
      depression. Our findings provide critical evidence for the notion that repeat 
      polymorphisms can act as complex genetic modifiers of depression.

TI  - A panel study on patients with dominant cerebellar ataxia highlights the 
      frequency of channelopathies.
PG  - 1579-1594
LID - 10.1093/brain/awx081 [doi]
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias have a marked heterogeneous genetic 
      background, with mutations in 34 genes identified so far. This large amount of 
      implicated genes accounts for heterogeneous clinical presentations, making 
      genotype-phenotype correlations a major challenge in the field. While 
      polyglutamine ataxias, linked to CAG repeat expansions in genes such as ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, CACNA1A and TBP, have been extensively characterized in 
      large cohorts, there is a need for comprehensive assessment of frequency and 
      phenotype of more 'conventional' ataxias. After exclusion of CAG/polyglutamine 
      expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia genes in 412 index cases with dominantly 
      inherited cerebellar ataxias, we aimed to establish the relative frequencies of 
      mutations in other genes, with an approach combining panel sequencing and TaqMan(R) 
      polymerase chain reaction assay. We found relevant genetic variants in 59 
      patients (14.3%). The most frequently mutated were channel genes [CACNA1A (n = 
      16), KCND3 (n = 4), KCNC3 (n = 2) and KCNA1 (n = 2)]. Deletions in ITPR1 (n = 11) 
      were followed by biallelic variants in SPG7 (n = 9). Variants in AFG3L2 (n = 7) 
      came next in frequency, and variants were rarely found in STBN2 (n = 2), ELOVL5, 
      FGF14, STUB1 and TTBK2 (n = 1 each). Interestingly, possible risk factor variants 
      were detected in SPG7 and POLG. Clinical comparisons showed that ataxias due to 
      channelopathies had a significantly earlier age at onset with an average of 24.6 
      years, versus 40.9 years for polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias and 
      37.8 years for SPG7-related forms (P = 0.001). In contrast, disease duration was 
      significantly longer in the former (20.5 years versus 9.3 and 13.7, P=0.001), 
      though for similar functional stages, indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. Of interest, intellectual deficiency was more frequent in channel 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, while cognitive impairment in adulthood was similar 
      among the three groups. Similar differences were found among a single gene group, 
      comparing 23 patients with CACNA1A expansions (spinocerebellar ataxia 6) to 22 
      patients with CACNA1A point mutations, which had lower average age at onset (25.2 
      versus 47.3 years) with longer disease duration (18.7 versus 10.9), but lower 
      severity indexes (0.39 versus 0.44), indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. In conclusion, we identified relevant genetic variations in up to 15% of 
      cases after exclusion of polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias, and 
      confirmed CACNA1A and SPG7 as major ataxia genes. We could delineate firm 
      genotype-phenotype correlations that are important for genetic counselling and of 
      possible prognostic value.

TI  - Spinal Cord Damage in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1.
PG  - 792-796
LID - 10.1007/s12311-017-0854-9 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by 
      a CAG repeat expansion, characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia and 
      pyramidal signs. Non-motor and extracerebellar symptoms may occur. MRI-based 
      studies in SCA1 focused in the cerebellum and connections, but there are no data 
      about cord damage in the disease and its clinical relevance. To evaluate in vivo 
      spinal cord damage in SCA1, a group of 31 patients with SCA1 and 31 age- and 
      gender-matched healthy controls underwent MRI on a 3T scanner. We used 
      T1-weighted 3D images to estimate the cervical spinal cord area (CA) and 
      eccentricity (CE) at three C2/C3 levels based on a semi-automatic image 
      segmentation protocol. The scale for assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA) was 
      used to quantify disease severity. The groups were significantly different 
      regarding CA (47.26 +/- 7.4 vs. 68.8 +/- 5.7 mm2, p < 0.001) and CE values 
      (0.803 +/- 0.044 vs. 0.774 +/- 0.043, p < 0.05). Furthermore, in the patient group, 
      CA presented significant correlation with SARA scores (R = -0.633, p < 0.001) and 
      CAGn expansion (R = -0.658, p < 0.001). CE was not associated with SARA scores 
      (p = 0.431). In the multiple variable regression, CA was strongly associated with 
      disease duration (coefficient -0.360, p < 0.05) and CAGn expansion (coefficient 
      -1.124, p < 0.001). SCA1 is characterized by cervical cord atrophy and 
      anteroposterior flattening. Morphometric analyses of the spinal cord MRI might be 
      a useful biomarker in the disease.

TI  - Compound heterozygous intermediate MJD alleles cause cerebellar ataxia with 
      sensory neuropathy.
PG  - e123
LID - e123
AB  - Spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) is a group of disorders characterized by 
      progressive ataxia caused by dysfunction and atrophy of the cerebellum or its 
      projections. Approximately one-third of SCD cases are familial SCD, the majority 
      of which are attributed to CAG triplet repeat expansions including 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, and dentate-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      triplet repeat number of the alleles representing complete penetrance varies 
      among diseases. Generally, there is a gap between the normal alleles and the 
      complete penetrance alleles. Rarely, intermediate alleles with the repeat numbers 
      between the abnormal and normal ranges are observed, although the implications of 
      these intermediate alleles remain ambiguous.

TI  - The Initial Symptom and Motor Progression in Spinocerebellar Ataxias.
PG  - 615-622
LID - 10.1007/s12311-016-0836-3 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study is to determine whether the initial symptom associates with 
      motor progression in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). SCAs are clinically 
      heterogeneous and the initial presentation may represent different subtypes of 
      SCA with different motor progression. We studied 317 participants with SCAs1, 2, 
      3, and 6 from the Clinical Research Consortium for SCAs (CRC-SCA) and repeatedly 
      measured the severity of ataxia for 2 years. SCA patients were divided into 
      gait-onset and non-gait-onset (speech, vision, and hand dexterity) groups based 
      on the initial presentation. In addition to demographic comparison, we employed 
      regression models to study ataxia progression in these two groups after adjusting 
      for age, sex, and pathological CAG repeats. The majority of SCA patients had gait 
      abnormality as an initial presentation. The pathological CAG repeat expansions 
      were similar between the gait-onset and non-gait-onset groups. In SCA1, 
      gait-onset group progressed slower than non-gait-onset group, while gait-onset 
      SCA6 group progressed faster than their counterpart. In addition, the disease 
      presented 9 years later for SCA2 gait-onset group than non-gait-onset group. 
      Initial symptoms of SCA3 did not influence age of onset or disease progression. 
      The initial symptom in each SCA has a different influence on age of onset and 
      motor progression. Therefore, gait and non-gait-onset groups of SCAs might 
      represent different subtypes of the diseases.

AB  - Expansion of the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the huntingtin (Htt) protein 
      causes Huntington's disease (HD), a fatal inherited movement disorder linked to 
      neurodegeneration in the striatum and cortex. S-nitrosylation and S-acylation of 
      cysteine residues regulate many functions of cytosolic proteins. We therefore 
      used a resin-assisted capture approach to identify these modifications in Htt. In 
      contrast to many proteins that have only a single S-nitrosylation or S-acylation 
      site, we identified sites along much of the length of Htt. Moreover, analysis of 
      cells expressing full-length Htt or a large N-terminal fragment of Htt shows that 
      polyQ expansion strongly increases Htt S-nitrosylation. This effect appears to be 
      general since it is also observed in Ataxin-1, which causes spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 1 (SCA1) when its polyQ tract is expanded. Overexpression of nitric 
      oxide synthase increases the S-nitrosylation of normal Htt and the frequency of 
      conspicuous juxtanuclear inclusions of Htt N-terminal fragments in transfected 
      cells. Taken together with the evidence that S-nitrosylation of Htt is widespread 
      and parallels polyQ expansion, these subcellular changes show that 
      S-nitrosylation affects the biology of this protein in vivo.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The natural history of clinical symptoms in the spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCA)s has been well characterised. However there is little longitudinal 
      data comparing cognitive changes in the most common SCA subtypes over time. The 
      present study provides a preliminary longitudinal characterisation of the 
      clinical and cognitive profiles in patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7, 
      with the aim of elucidating the role of the cerebellum in cognition. METHODS: 13 
      patients with different SCAs all caused by CAG repeat expansion (SCA1, n = 2; 
      SCA2, n = 2; SCA3, n = 2; SCA6, n = 4; and SCA7, n = 3) completed a comprehensive 
      battery of cognitive and mood assessments at two time points, a mean of 
      7.35 years apart. All patients were evaluated clinically using the Scale for the 
      Rating and Assessment of Ataxia (SARA) and the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs 
      (INAS). Patients underwent structural MRI imaging at follow-up. RESULTS: Clinical 
      scale scores increased in all patients over time, most prominently in the SCA1 
      (SARA) and SCA3 (INAS) groups. New impairments on neuropsychological tests were 
      most commonly observed with executive functions, speed, attention, visual memory 
      and Theory of Mind. Results suggest possible differences in cognitive decline in 
      SCA subtypes, with the most rapid cognitive decline observed in the SCA1 
      patients, and the least in the SCA6 patients, congruent with observed patterns of 
      motor deterioration. Minimal changes in mood were observed, and MRI measures of 
      atrophy did not correlate with cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: As well as 
      increasing physical impairment, cognitive decline over time appears to be a 
      distinct aspect of the SCA phenotype, in keeping with the cerebellar 
      cognitive-affective syndrome. Our data suggest a trend of cognitive decline that 
      is different for each SCA subtype, and for the majority is related to the 
      severity of cerebellar motor impairment.

TI  - Expansion and Hepatic Differentiation of Adult Blood-Derived CD34+ Progenitor 
      Cells and Promotion of Liver Regeneration After Acute Injury.
PG  - 723-32
LID - 10.5966/sctm.2015-0268 [doi]
AB  - The low availability of functional hepatocytes has been an unmet demand for basic 
      scientific research, new drug development, and cell-based clinical applications 
      for decades. Because of the inability to expand hepatocytes in vitro, alternative 
      sources of hepatocytes are a focus of liver regenerative medicine. We report a 
      new group of blood-derived CD34(+) progenitor cells (BDPCs) that have the ability 
      to expand and differentiate into functional hepatocyte-like cells and promote 
      liver regeneration. BDPCs were obtained from the peripheral blood of an adult 
      mouse with expression of surface markers CD34, CD45, Sca-1, c-kit, and Thy1.1. 
      BDPCs can proliferate in vitro and differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells 
      expressing hepatocyte markers, including CK8, CK18, CK19, alpha-fetoprotein, 
      integrin-beta1, and A6. The differentiated BDPCs (dBDPCs) also display 
      liver-specific functional activities, such as glycogen storage, urea production, 
      and albumin secretion. dBDPCs have cytochrome P450 activity and express specific 
      hepatic transcription factors, such as hepatic nuclear factor 1alpha. To demonstrate 
      liver regenerative activity, dBDPCs were injected into mice with severe acute 
      liver damage caused by a high-dose injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). 
      dBDPC treatment rescued the mice from severe acute liver injury, increased 
      survival, and induced liver regeneration. Because of their ease of access and 
      application through peripheral blood and their capability of rapid expansion and 
      hepatic differentiation, BDPCs have great potential as a cell-based therapy for 
      liver disease. SIGNIFICANCE: Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell expansion and 
      tissue-specific differentiation in vitro are challenges in regenerative medicine, 
      although stem cell therapy has raised hope for the treatment of liver diseases by 
      overcoming the scarcity of hepatocytes. This study identified and characterized a 
      group of blood-derived progenitor cells (BDPCs) from the peripheral blood of an 
      adult mouse. The CD34(+) progenitor-dominant BDPCs were rapidly expanded and 
      hepatically differentiated into functional hepatocyte-like cells with our 
      established coculture system. BDPC treatment increased animal survival and 
      produced full regeneration in a severe liver injury mouse model caused by CCl4. 
      BDPCs could have potential for liver cell therapies.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 28: a novel AFG3L2 mutation in a German family with young 
      onset, slow progression and saccadic slowing.
PG  - 19

LID - 19
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 28 (SCA28) is related to mutations of the 
      ATPase family gene 3-like 2 gene (AFG3L2). To date, 13 private missense mutations 
      have been identified in families of French, Italian, and German ancestry, but 
      overall, the disorder seems to be rare in Europe. Here, we report a kindred of 
      German ancestry with four affected family members presenting with slowly 
      progressive ataxia, mild pyramidal tract signs and slow saccades. METHODS: After 
      excluding repeat expansions in the genes for SCA1-3, 6-8, 10, 12, and 17, Sanger 
      sequencing of the coding regions of TTBK2 (SCA11), KCNC3 (SCA13), PRKCG (SCA14), 
      FGF14 (SCA27) and AFG3L2 (SCA28) was performed. The 17 coding exons of AFG3L2 
      with flanking intronic sequences were amplified by PCR and sequenced on both 
      strands. RESULTS: Sequencing detected a novel potential missense mutation 
      (p.Y689N) in the C-terminal proteolytic domain, the mutational hotspot of AFG3L2. 
      The online programme "PolyPhen-2" classifies this amino acid exchange as probably 
      damaging (score 0.990). Similarly to most of the published SCA28 mutations, the 
      novel mutation is located within exon 16. Mutations in exon 16 alter the 
      proteolytic activity of the protease AFG3L2 that is highly expressed in Purkinje 
      cells. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic testing should be considered in dominant ataxia with 
      pyramidal tract signs and saccadic slowing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias are dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      diseases. As potential treatments for these diseases are being developed, precise 
      knowledge of their natural history is needed. We aimed to study the long-term 
      disease progression of the most common spinocerebellar ataxias: SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, 
      and SCA6. Furthermore, we aimed to establish the order and occurrence of 
      non-ataxia symptoms, and identify predictors of disease progression. METHODS: In 
      this longitudinal cohort study (EUROSCA), we enrolled men and women with positive 
      genetic testing for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 and with progressive, otherwise 
      unexplained ataxia who were aged 18 years or older from 17 ataxia referral 
      centres in ten European countries. Patients were seen every year for 3 years, and 
      at irregular intervals thereafter. The primary outcome was the scale for the 
      assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA), and the inventory of non-ataxia signs 
      (INAS). We used linear mixed models to analyse progression. To account for 
      dropouts, we applied a pattern-mixture model. This study is registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02440763. FINDINGS: Between July 1, 2005, and Aug 
      31, 2006, 526 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 were enrolled. We analysed 
      data for 462 patients with at least one follow-up visit. Median observation time 
      was 49 months (IQR 35-72). SARA progression data were best fitted with a linear 
      model in all genotypes. Annual SARA score increase was 2.11 (SE 0.12) in patients 
      with SCA1, 1.49 (0.07) in patients with SCA2, 1.56 (0.08) in patients with SCA3, 
      and 0.80 (0.09) in patients with SCA6. The increase of the number of non-ataxia 
      signs reached a plateau in SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3. In patients with SCA6, the 
      number of non-ataxia symptoms increased linearly, but more slowly than in 
      patients with SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 (p<0.0001). Factors that were associated with 
      faster progression of the SARA score were short duration of follow-up (p=0.0179), 
      older age at inclusion (0.04 [SE 0.02] per additional year; p=0.0476), and longer 
      repeat expansions (0.06 [SE 0.02] per additional repeat unit; p=0.0128) in SCA1, 
      short duration of follow-up (p<0.0001), lower age at onset (-0.02 [SE 0.01] per 
      additional year; p=0.0014), and lower baseline SARA score (-0.02 [SE 0.01] per 
      additional SARA point; p=0.0083) in SCA2, and lower baseline SARA score (-0.03 
      [SE 0.01] per additional SARA point; p=0.0195) in SCA6. In SCA3, we did not 
      identify factors that affected progression of the SARA score. INTERPRETATION: Our 
      study provides quantitative data on the progression of the most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxias based on a follow-up period that exceeds those of 
      previous studies. Our data could prove useful for sample size calculation and 
      patient stratification in interventional trials. FUNDING: EU FP6 (EUROSCA),

      spinocerebellar ataxia: a Thai multicentre study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: About 50 % of Thai patients with adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) was Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6. The author 
      investigated further on less common SCAs in the patients without any known 
      mutations. METHODS: DNA samples of 82 index patients who were genetically 
      excluded MJD, SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) were examined. Analysis of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, SCA17 and SCA19 genes were 
      comprehensively performed. Normal range of trinucleotide repeat expansion sizes 
      of TATA-box-binding protein gene (TBP) were also determined in 374 control 
      subjects. RESULTS: Eight patients carried >/=42 CAG/CAA repeat allele in the TBP 
      consistent with SCA17. The pathological repeat alleles ranged from 42 to 57 
      repeats. All patients had significant degree of cognitive dysfunction. Other 
      non-ataxic phenotypes comprised of parkinsonism, chorea, dystonia and myoclonus. 
      A sporadic patient carried a heterozygous 41-repeat allele developed chronic 
      progressive cerebellar degeneration commenced at the age of 28 years. Whilst, 2 % 
      of the control subjects (8/374) carried the 41-repeat allele. Five of the 
      carriers were re-examined, and revealed that four of them had parkinsonism and/or 
      cognitive impairment without cerebellar signs. Analysis of other types of SCAs 
      was all negative. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA17 and SCA19 in Thais. SCA17 appears to be an important cause of ataxia in 
      Thailand. Although, the pathological cut-off point of the TBP repeat allele 
      remains unclear, the finding suggests that the 41-repeat may be a pathological 
      allele resulting late-onset or mild phenotype. Apart from ataxia, cognitive 
      impairment and parkinsonism may be clinical presentations in these carriers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association of repeat expansion size in 10 common 
      degenerative hereditary ataxia genes with essential tremor. These genes were 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 
      (CACNA1A), SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), 
      SCA-17 (TBP) and dentatorubral-pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA) (ATN1). METHODS: 
      Genetic analysis of repeat size in 10 degenerative hereditary ataxia loci was 
      performed in 323 essential tremor patients and 299 controls enrolled at Columbia 
      University. To test for differences in the allele distribution between patients 
      and controls, a CLUMP analysis was performed. RESULTS: None of the essential 
      tremor patients had a repeat expansion in the intermediate or pathogenic range. 
      Significant differences in the distribution of repeats in the 'normal' range for 
      SCA2 and SCA8 (both p </= 0.02) were observed between essential tremor patients and 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      SCA loci are not associated with essential tremor.

PG  - 165-73

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are characterized by autosomal dominantly 
      inherited progressive ataxia but are clinically heterogeneous due to variable 
      involvement of non-cerebellar parts of the nervous system. Non-cerebellar 
      symptoms contribute significantly to the burden of SCAs, may guide the clinician 
      to the underlying genetic subtype, and might be useful markers to monitor 
      disease. Peripheral neuropathy is frequently observed in SCA, but 
      subtype-specific features and subclinical manifestations have rarely been 
      evaluated. We performed a multicenter nerve conduction study with 162 patients 
      with genetically confirmed SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6. The study proved 
      peripheral nerves to be involved in the neurodegenerative process in 82 % of 
      SCA1, 63 % of SCA2, 55 % of SCA3, and 22 % of SCA6 patients. Most patients of all 
      subtypes revealed affection of both sensory and motor fibers. Neuropathy was most 
      frequently of mixed type with axonal and demyelinating characteristics in all SCA 
      subtypes. However, nerve conduction velocities of SCA1 patients were slower 
      compared to other genotypes. SCA6 patients revealed less axonal damage than 
      patients with other subtypes. No influence of CAG repeat length or biometric 
      determinants on peripheral neuropathy could be identified in SCA1, SCA3, and 
      SCA6. In SCA2, earlier onset and more severe ataxia were associated with 
      peripheral neuropathy. We proved peripheral neuropathy to be a frequent site of 
      the neurodegenerative process in all common SCA subtypes. Since damage to 
      peripheral nerves is readily assessable by electrophysiological means, nerve 
      conduction studies should be performed in a longitudinal approach to assess these 
      parameters as potential progression markers.

AB  - A 50-year-old Japanese man showed slowly progressive gait disturbance and 
      dysarthria. Neurological examination 5 years after onset revealed slow eye 
      movement with nystagmus as well as limb and truncal ataxia. Magnetic resonance 
      imaging showed atrophy of the cerebellum and brainstem. Because genetic 
      examination revealed CAG repeat expansion of the ataxin-1 gene, the patient was 
      diagnosed with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1. Ten years after onset, he showed 
      psychiatric symptoms with cognitive impairment, and antipsychotic drugs were 
      administered. As psychiatric symptoms gradually worsened, particularly with 
      regard to resisting nursing care and shouting, the doses of the drugs were 
      increased. Although the clinicopathologic findings were generally identical to 
      previously reported spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 cases with the exception of the 
      conspicuous psychiatric symptoms, there are two notable immunohistochemical 
      findings. Firstly, numerous anti-expanded polyglutamine antibody-immunopositive 
      neuronal inclusions were extensively observed, including in the cerebral cortex 
      and limbic system, but not in the Purkinje cells. Secondly, anti-fused in sarcoma 
      antibody-immunopositive intranuclear inclusions were extensively observed. We 
      posit that the anti-expanded polyglutamine antibody-immunopositive neuronal 
      inclusions and possibly the anti-fused in sarcoma antibody-immunopositive 
      inclusions, particularly those in the neocortex and limbic system, may correspond 
      to the psychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment that were observed in the 
      patient.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) is predominantly characterized 
      by action tremor, followed by slowly progressive cerebellar dysfunction. It is a 
      very rare disorder and only identified in certain countries so far. The current 
      appreciation for phenotypic and genotypic features of SCA12 is still limited. 
      METHODS: We investigated CAG copies within PPP2R2B in 29 patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia who are excluded from the most common SCA subtypes 
      including SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6. The medical data of patients carrying 
      abnormal expanded PPP2R2B allele were reviewed and summarized. RESULTS: We found 
      that 3 patients carried 53, 46 and 54 CAG repeats respectively, while the other 
      26 cases harbored CAG repeats less than 30. The probably shortest pathogenic 
      allele of 46 repeats was detected in one kindred typically experiencing action 
      tremor. Additionally, compared to the prominent cerebellar ataxia, nystagmus and 
      dysphagia seem to be rare in our SCA12 patients. CONCLUSIONS: SCA12 might not be 
      as rare in Chinese as previously assumed. The identification of the shortest 
      pathogenic allele helps to define the minimal limit implicated in the disease 
      onset. Moreover, the disease manifestations distinct from other SCA subtypes 
      could help clinicians to provide timely genetic counseling.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an incurable, dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative disease of the cerebellum caused by a polyglutamine-repeat 
      expansion in the protein ataxin-1 (ATXN1). While analysis of human autopsy 
      material indicates significant glial pathology in SCA1, previous research has 
      focused on characterizing neuronal dysfunction. In this study, we characterized 
      astrocytic and microglial response in SCA1 using a comprehensive array of mouse 
      models. We have discovered that astrocytes and microglia are activated very early 
      in SCA1 pathogenesis even when mutant ATXN1 expression was limited to Purkinje 
      neurons. Glial activation occurred in the absence of neuronal death, suggesting 
      that glial activation results from signals emanating from dysfunctional neurons. 
      Finally, in all different models examined glial activation closely correlated 
      with disease progression, supporting the development of glial-based biomarkers to 
      follow disease progression.

AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that are related 
      to at least 36 different genetic loci; they are clinically characterized by 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia and are frequently accompanied by other 
      neurological and non-neurological manifestations. The relative frequency of SCA 
      varies greatly among different regions, presumably because of a founder effect or 
      local ethnicities. Between July 1998 and May 2012, we investigated 320 Brazilian 
      patients with an SCA phenotype who belonged to 150 unrelated families with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and 23 sporadic patients from 13 Brazilian 
      states. A total of 265 patients (82.8%) belonging to 131 unrelated families 
      (87.3%) were found to have a definite mutation, and SCA3 accounted for most of 
      the familial cases (70.7%), followed by SCA7 (6%), SCA1 (5.3%), SCA2 (2.7%), SCA6 
      (1.3%), SCA8 (0.7%) and SCA10 (0.7%). In the Ribeirao Preto mesoregion, which is 
      located in the northeast part of Sao Paulo State, the prevalence of SCA3 was 
      approximately 5 per 100,000 inhabitants, which is the highest prevalence found in 
      Brazil. No mutation was found in the SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA genes, and all the 
      sporadic cases remained without a molecular diagnosis. This study further 
      characterizes the spectrum of SCA mutations found in Brazilian patients, which 
      suggests the existence of regional differences and demonstrates the expansion of 
      the SCA8 locus in Brazilian families.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a late onset autosomal 
      dominant cerebellar ataxia, caused by CAG triplet repeat expansion in the ATXN1 
      gene. The frequency of SCA1 occurrence is more in Southern India than in other 
      regions as observed from hospital-based studies. However there are no reports on 
      variability of CAG repeat expansion, phenotype-genotype association and founder 
      mutations in a homogenous population from India. METHODS: Genomic DNA isolated 
      from buccal mouthwash of the individuals in the cohort was used for PCR-based 
      diagnosis of SCA1. Subsequently SNP's found within the ATXN1 loci were identified 
      by Taqman allelic discrimination assays. Significance testing of the 
      genotype-phenotype associations was calculated by Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test with 
      post-hoc Dunnett's test and Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: By 
      genetic analysis of an affected population in Southern India we identified 21 
      pre-symptomatic individuals including four that were well past the average age of 
      disease onset of 44 years, 16 symptomatic and 63 normal individuals. All 
      pre-symptomatic cases harbor "pure" expansions of greater than 40 CAGs. 
      Genotyping to test for the presence of two previously identified SNPs showed a 
      founder effect of the same repeat carrying allele as in the general Indian 
      population. We show that SCA1 disease onset is significantly delayed when 
      transmission of the disease is maternal. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of early 
      disease onset in individuals with a paternally inherited allele could serve as 
      valuable information for clinicians towards early detection of SCA1 in patients 
      with affected fathers. Identification of older pre-symptomatic individuals (n = 
      4) in our cohort among individuals with a shared genetic and environmental 
      background, suggests that second site genetic or epigenetic modifiers might 
      significantly affect SCA1 disease progression. Moreover, such undetected SCA1 
      cases could underscore the true prevalence of SCA1 in India.

TI  - Role of dynamic and mitochondrial mutations in neurodegenerative diseases with 
      ataxia: lower repeats and LNAs at multiple loci as alternative pathogenesis.
PG  - 837-47

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia is a growing group of hereditary neurodegenerative 
      diseases for which >/=30 different genetic loci have been identified. In this 
      study, we assessed the repeats at eight spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) loci in 188 
      clinical SCA patients and 100 individuals without any neurological signs. Results 
      from the present study were able to identify 16/188 (8.5%) clinical ataxia 
      patients with repeat expansions in the pathological range of SCA genes, with the 
      majority having expansion at the SCA1, 2, and 3 loci. The present study further 
      evaluated two mitochondrial mutations associated with ataxia, i.e., T8993G and 
      A8344G. Six patients were identified with A8344G mutation and none had the 
      mutation in ATPase 6 gene; however, G8994A variation was found in three cases. 
      Overall, three cases had triplet repeat expansions as well as mitochondrial (mt) 
      mutations, which indicates potential association of triplet repeat expansions and 
      mitochondrial mutations. Both the molecular analysis of several SCA loci and two 
      relevant mt mutations indicated that the majority of ataxia cases were still 
      undiagnosed; hence, the following hypotheses were proposed and tested based on 
      available data: (i) lower repeats than normal range and (ii) large normal alleles 
      (LNAs) at multiple loci may be an alternative basis for disease pathogenesis.

TI  - Decreased expression of glutamate transporter GLAST in Bergmann glia is 
      associated with the loss of Purkinje neurons in the spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      1.
PG  - 8-11
LID - 10.1007/s12311-014-0605-0 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease of the cerebellum caused by a polyglutamine-repeat expansion in the 
      protein ATXN1. We have previously demonstrated that astrocytic activation occurs 
      early in pathogenesis, correlates with disease progression, and can occur when 
      mutant ATXN1 expression is limited to Purkinje neurons. We now show that 
      expression of glutamate and aspartate transporter, GLAST, is decreased in 
      cerebellar astrocytes in a mouse model of SCA1. This decrease occurs in non-cell 
      autonomous manner late in disease and correlates well with the loss of Purkinje 
      neurons. Astrogliosis or decreased neuronal activity does not correlate with 
      diminished GLAST expression. In addition, Bergmann glia remain capable of 
      transcriptional upregulation of GLAST in response to improvement in Purkinje 
      neurons supporting the notion of active neuron-glia crosstalk in disease.

TI  - Hmga2 is a direct target gene of RUNX1 and regulates expansion of myeloid 
      progenitors in mice.
PG  - 2203-12
LID - 10.1182/blood-2014-02-554543 [doi]
AB  - RUNX1 is a master transcription factor in hematopoiesis and mediates the 
      specification and homeostasis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). 
      Disruptions in RUNX1 are well known to lead to hematologic disease. In this 
      study, we sought to identify and characterize RUNX1 target genes in HSPCs by 
      performing RUNX1 chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing 
      (ChIP-seq) using a murine HSPC line and complementing this data with our 
      previously described gene expression profiling of primary wild-type and 
      RUNX1-deficient HSPCs (Lineage(-)/cKit(+)/Sca1(+)). From this analysis, we 
      identified and confirmed that Hmga2, a known oncogene, as a direct target of 
      RUNX1. Hmga2 was strongly upregulated in RUNX1-deficient HSPCs, and the promoter 
      of Hmga2 was responsive in a cell-type dependent manner upon coexpression of 
      RUNX1. Conditional Runx1 knockout mice exhibit expansion of their HSPCs and 
      myeloid progenitors as hallmark phenotypes. To further validate and establish 
      that Hmga2 plays a role in inducing HSPC expansion, we generated mouse models of 
      HMGA2 and RUNX1 deficiency. Although mice lacking both factors continued to 
      display higher frequencies of HSPCs, the expansion of myeloid progenitors was 
      effectively rescued. The data presented here establish Hmga2 as a transcriptional 
      target of RUNX1 and a critical regulator of myeloid progenitor expansion.

TI  - Modulation of the age at onset in spinocerebellar ataxia by CAG tracts in various 
      genes.
PG  - 2444-55
LID - 10.1093/brain/awu174 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine-coding (CAG)n repeat expansions in seven different genes cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxias. Although the size of the expansion is negatively 
      correlated with age at onset, it accounts for only 50-70% of its variability. To 
      find other factors involved in this variability, we performed a regression 
      analysis in 1255 affected individuals with identified expansions (spinocerebellar 
      ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7), recruited through the European Consortium on 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxias, to determine whether age at onset is influenced by the 
      size of the normal allele in eight causal (CAG)n-containing genes (ATXN1-3, 6-7, 
      17, ATN1 and HTT). We confirmed the negative effect of the expanded allele and 
      detected threshold effects reflected by a quadratic association between age at 
      onset and CAG size in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 3 and 6. We also evidenced 
      an interaction between the expanded and normal alleles in trans in individuals 
      with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 6 and 7. Except for individuals with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, age at onset was also influenced by other 
      (CAG)n-containing genes: ATXN7 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2; ATXN2, ATN1 and 
      HTT in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3; ATXN1 and ATXN3 in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 6; and ATXN3 and TBP in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7. This suggests that 
      there are biological relationships among these genes. The results were partially 
      replicated in four independent populations representing 460 Caucasians and 216 
      Asian samples; the differences are possibly explained by ethnic or geographical 
      differences. As the variability in age at onset is not completely explained by 
      the effects of the causative and modifier sister genes, other genetic or 
      environmental factors must also play a role in these diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA)--SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and 
      SCA6--are caused by (CAG)n repeat expansion. While the number of repeats of the 
      coding (CAG)n expansions is correlated with the age at onset, there are no 
      appropriate models that include both affected and preclinical carriers allowing 
      for the prediction of age at onset. METHODS: We combined data from two major 
      European cohorts of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6 mutation carriers: 1187 affected 
      individuals from the EUROSCA registry and 123 preclinical individuals from the 
      RISCA cohort. For each SCA genotype, a regression model was fitted using a 
      log-normal distribution for age at onset with the repeat length of the alleles as 
      covariates. From these models, we calculated expected age at onset from birth and 
      conditionally that this age is greater than the current age. RESULTS: For SCA2 
      and SCA3 genotypes, the expanded allele was a significant predictor of age at 
      onset (-0.105+/-0.005 and -0.056+/-0.003) while for SCA1 and SCA6 genotypes both the 
      size of the expanded and normal alleles were significant (expanded: -0.049+/-0.002 
      and -0.090+/-0.009, respectively; normal: +0.013+/-0.005 and -0.029+/-0.010, 
      respectively). According to the model, we indicated the median values (90% 
      critical region) and the expectancy (SD) of the predicted age at onset for each 
      SCA genotype according to the CAG repeat size and current age. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      estimations can be valuable in clinical and research. However, results need to be 
      confirmed in other independent cohorts and in future longitudinal studies.

TI  - The histone deacetylase HDAC3 is essential for Purkinje cell function, 
      potentially complicating the use of HDAC inhibitors in SCA1.
PG  - 3733-45
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddu081 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a pathogenic glutamine repeat expansion in the protein ataxin-1 
      (ATXN1). One likely mechanism mediating pathogenesis is excessive transcriptional 
      repression induced by the expanded ATXN-1. Because ATXN1 binds HDAC3, a Class I 
      histone deacetylase (HDAC) that we have found to be required for ATXN1-induced 
      transcriptional repression, we tested whether genetically depleting HDAC3 
      improves the phenotype of the SCA1 knock-in mouse (SCA1(154Q/2Q)), the most 
      physiologically relevant model of SCA1. Given that HDAC3 null mice are embryonic 
      lethal, we used for our analyses a combination of HDAC3 haploinsufficient and 
      Purkinje cell (PC)-specific HDAC3 null mice. Although deleting a single allele of 
      HDAC3 in the context of SCA1 was insufficient to improve cerebellar and cognitive 
      deficits of the disease, a complete loss of PC HDAC3 was highly deleterious both 
      behaviorally, with mice showing early onset ataxia, and pathologically, with 
      progressive histologic evidence of degeneration. Inhibition of HDAC3 may yet have 
      a role in SCA1 therapy, but our study provides cautionary evidence that this 
      approach could produce untoward effects. Indeed, the neurotoxic consequences of 
      HDAC3 depletion could prove relevant, wherever pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC3 
      is being contemplated, in disorders ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration.

AB  - We evaluated the contributions of various polyglutamine (polyQ) disease genes to 
      Parkinson's disease (PD). We compared the distributions of polyQ repeat lengths 
      in 8 common genes (ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, ATN1, and HTT) in 
      299 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant PD (ADPD) and 329 normal controls. 
      We also analyzed the possibility of genetic interactions between ATXN1 and ATXN2, 
      ATXN2 and ATXN3, and ATXN2 and CACNA1A. Intermediate-length polyQ expansions (>24 
      Qs) of ATXN2 were found in 7 ADPD patients and no controls (7/299 = 2.34% and 
      0/329 = 0%, respectively; p = 0.0053 < 0.05/8 after Bonferroni correction). These 
      patients showed typical L-DOPA-responsive PD phenotypes. Conversely, no 
      significant differences in polyQ repeat lengths were found between the ADPD 
      patients and the controls for the other 7 genes. Our results may support the 
      hypothesis that ATXN2 polyQ expansion is a specific predisposing factor for 
      multiple neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - The human immune system can be reconstituted in experimental animals by 
      transplanting human hematopoietic stem cells (hHSCs) into immunodeficient mice. 
      To generate such humanized mice, further improvements are required, particularly 
      to ensure that transplanted hHSCs are maintained in mice and proliferate long 
      enough to follow prolonged immune responses to chronic diseases or monitor 
      therapeutic effects. To prepare the relatively human bone marrow environment in 
      mice, we generated nonobese diabetic/severe combined 
      immunodeficiency/interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain null (NOG) mice expressing 
      human Jagged1 (hJ1) in an osteoblast-specific manner (hJ1-NOG mice) to examine 
      whether Notch signaling induced by hJ1 mediates hHSC proliferation and/or 
      maintenance in mice. The established hJ1-NOG mice possess relatively larger bone 
      marrow space and thinner cortical bone compared with nontransgenic littermates, 
      but the number of c-kit(+) Sca-1(+) lineage(-) cells was not significantly 
      different between hJ1-NOG and nontransgenic littermates. In the transplantation 
      experiments of CD34(+) cells obtained from human cord blood, CD34(+)CD38(-) cells 
      (hHSCs) were more increased in hJ1-NOG recipient mice than in nontransgenic 
      littermates in mouse bone marrow environment. In contrast, the transplanted mouse 
      c-kit(+) Sca-1(+) lineage(-) cells did not show significant increase in the same 
      hJ1-NOG mice. These results suggest that hJ1-NOG mice could contribute to the 
      growth of transplanted human CD34(+) cells in a human-specific manner and be 
      useful to study the in vivo behavior and/or development of human stem cells, 
      including cancer stem cells and immune cells.

AB  - Trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansion underpins a number of inheritable 
      neurological human disorders. Multiple mechanisms are thought to contribute to 
      the expansion process. The incorrect processing of the repeat tract by DNA repair 
      proteins can drive this mutation process forward, as expansions are suppressed 
      following ablation of certain repair factors in mouse models and cell models of 
      disease. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is one repair pathway implicated in TNR 
      instability, although most previous work focussed on TNR contractions, not 
      expansions. Here we investigated the role of NER in modulating expansions of 
      threshold-length (CTG.CAG) repeats in yeast. We show that both the global genome 
      and transcription-coupled repair subpathways promote expansions of 
      threshold-length TNRs. Furthermore, NER works with the 26S proteasome to drive 
      expansions, based on analysis of double mutants defective in both pathways, and 
      of Rad23, a protein involved in both NER and the shuttling of ubiquitinated 
      proteins to the proteasome. This work provides the first evidence that both 
      subpathways of NER can promote threshold-length TNR expansions and that NER 
      interacts with the proteasome to drive expansions.

AB  - Limited data exist on the spectrum of heredoataxias in Greece, including the 
      prevalence and phenotype of Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) and the prevalence and 
      subtypes of dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). We analyzed clinically and 
      investigated genetically for FRDA and triplet-repeat expansion SCAs a consecutive 
      series of 186 patients with suspected heredoataxia referred to Athens over 18 
      years. For prevalence estimates we included patients with molecular diagnosis 
      from Cyprus that were absent from the Athens cohort. The minimum prevalence of 
      FRDA was ~0.9/100,000, with clusters of high prevalence in Aegean islands. FRDA 
      was diagnosed in 73 probands. The genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of FRDA was 
      similar to other populations, with one patient compound heterozygote for a known 
      point mutation in FXN (Asn146Lys). Undiagnosed recessive ataxias included 
      FRDA-like and spastic ataxias. The minimum prevalence of dominant SCAs was 
      ~0.7/100,000. SCA1 (4), SCA7 (4), SCA2, SCA6, and SCA17 (1 each) probands were 
      identified. A molecular diagnosis was reached in 31% of dominant cases. 
      Undiagnosed dominant patients included a majority of type III autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxias. FRDA is the commonest heredoataxia in the Greek population 
      with prevalence towards the lower end of other European populations. Dominant 
      SCAs are almost as prevalent. SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and SCA17 patients complete 
      the spectrum of cases with a specific molecular diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a group of hereditary 
      neurodegenerative disorders. Prevalence of SCA subtypes differ worldwide. 
      Autosomal dominant ataxias are the commonest types of inherited ataxias seen in 
      Sri Lanka. The aim of the study is to determine the genetic etiology of patients 
      with autosomal dominant ataxia in Sri Lanka and to describe the clinical features 
      of each genetic subtype. METHODS: Thirty four patients with autosomal dominant 
      ataxia were recruited. For every patient the following was done: recording of 
      clinical details and genotyping for SCA 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, and 17. RESULTS: 
      Sixty one per cent of the subjects were identified as SCA1. One subject had SCA2, 
      12 remain unidentified. Mean age at onset was 34.8 +/- 10years for SCA1 and 
      32.7 +/- 9.8 for non SCA1. 76% of SCA1 patients and 50% of non SCA1 were using 
      walking aids. Quantification of symptoms and signs were similar in the SCA1 and 
      non SCA1 groups. Clinical depression was evidenced in 68.4% of SCA1 and 75% non 
      SCA-1 patients. Mean CAG repeat length in SCA1 patients was 52.0 +/- 3.8, with 
      greater anticipation seen with paternal inheritance. CONCLUSION: SCA1 was the 
      predominant subtype and showed similar phenotype to previous reports. However, 
      disease severity was higher and depression more prevalent in this population than 
      previously described.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias are dominantly inherited disorders that are associated 
      with progressive brain degeneration, mainly affecting the cerebellum and 
      brainstem. As part of the multicentre European integrated project on 
      spinocerebellar ataxias study, 37 patients with spinocerebellar ataxia-1, 19 with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-3 and seven with spinocerebellar ataxia-6 were clinically 
      examined and underwent magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and after a 2-year 
      follow-up. All patients were compared with age-matched and gender-matched healthy 
      control subjects. Magnetic resonance imaging analysis included three-dimensional 
      volumetry and observer-independent longitudinal voxel-based morphometry. 
      Volumetry revealed loss of brainstem, cerebellar and basal ganglia volume in all 
      genotypes. Most sensitive to change was the pontine volume in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia-1, striatal volume in spinocerebellar ataxia-3 and caudate volume in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-6. Sensitivity to change, as measured by standard response 
      mean, of the respective MRI measures was greater than that of the most sensitive 
      clinical measure, the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia. Longitudinal 
      voxel-based morphometry revealed greatest grey matter loss in the cerebellum and 
      brainstem in spinocerebellar ataxia-1, in the putamen and pallidum in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-3 and in the cerebellum, thalamus, putamen and pallidum in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-6. There was a mild correlation between CAG repeat length 
      and volume loss of the bilateral cerebellum and the pons in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia-1. Quantitative volumetry and voxel-based morphometry imaging demonstrated 
      genotype-specific patterns of atrophy progression in spinocerebellar ataxias-1, 3 
      and 6, and they showed a high sensitivity to detect change that was superior to 
      clinical scales. These structural magnetic resonance imaging findings have the 
      potential to serve as surrogate markers, which might help to delineate 
      quantifiable endpoints and non-invasive methods for rapid and reliable data 
      acquisition, encouraging their use in clinical trials.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by polyglutamine repeat expansions in Ataxin-1. Recent evidence 
      supports a role for microRNAs (miRNAs) deregulation in SCA1 pathogenesis. 
      However, the extent to which miRNAs may modulate the onset, progression or 
      severity of SCA1 remains largely unknown. In this study, we used a mouse model of 
      SCA1 to determine if miRNAs are misregulated in pre- and post-symptomatic SCA1 
      cerebellum. We found a significant alteration in the steady-state levels of 
      numerous miRNAs prior to and following phenotypic onset. In addition, we provide 
      evidence that increased miR-150 levels in SCA1 Purkinje neurons may modulate 
      disease pathogenesis by targeting the expression of Rgs8 and Vegfa.

TI  - Analysis of CAG repeats in five SCA loci in Mexican population: epidemiological 
      evidence of a SCA7 founder effect.
PG  - 159-65
LID - 10.1111/cge.12114 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. CAG (cytosine-adenine-guanine) trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 
      causative genes have been identified as the cause of different SCA. In this 
      study, we simultaneously genotyped SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 applying a 
      fluorescent multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay. We analyzed 10 families 
      with SCA (64 patients) from five different communities of Veracruz, a Mexican 
      southeastern state, and identified 55 patients for SCA7 and 9 for SCA2, but none 
      for SCA1, SCA3, or SCA6. To our knowledge, this sample represents one of the 
      largest series of SCA7 cases reported worldwide. Genotyping of 300 healthy 
      individuals from Mexican population and compiled data from different ethnicities 
      showed discordant results concerning the hypothesis that SCA disease alleles 
      arise by expansion of large normal alleles.

TI  - Ataxin-1 and ataxin-2 intermediate-length PolyQ expansions in amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis.
PG  - 2315-20
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0b013e318278b618 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence suggests that intermediate-length polyglutamine 
      (PolyQ) expansions in the ataxin-2 (ATXN-2) gene are a risk factor for 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This work was undertaken with the aim to 
      investigate the frequency of ataxin-1 (ATXN-1) and ATXN-2 PolyQ expansions in a 
      cohort of patients with sporadic ALS (sALS) and patients with familial ALS (fALS) 
      from southern Italy. METHODS: We assessed the PolyQ lengths of ATXN-1 and ATXN-2 
      in 405 patients with sALS, 13 patients with fALS, and 296 unrelated controls 
      without history of neurodegenerative disorders. RESULTS: We found significantly 
      higher intermediate PolyQ expansions >/= 32 for ATXN-1 alleles and >/= 28 for ATXN-2 
      alleles in the sALS cohort (ATXN-1: ALS, 7.07% vs controls, 2.38%; p = 0.0001; 
      ATXN-2: ALS, 2.72% vs controls, 0.5%; p = 0.001). ATXN-1 CAT and ATXN-2 CAA 
      interruptions were detected in patients with ALS only. Age at onset, site of 
      onset, and sex were not significantly related to the ATXN-1 or ATXN-2 PolyQ 
      repeat length expansions. CONCLUSIONS: Both ATXN-1 and ATXN-2 PolyQ intermediate 
      expansions are independently associated with an increased risk for ALS.

AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) encompass a heterogeneous group of 
      rare diseases that affect the cerebellum and its connections. The most common 
      forms have been associated with dynamic mutations while some rarer forms with 
      conventional mutations. Studies in different populations revealed differences in 
      their relative frequencies both within and between the studied populations, 
      showing that the frequencies are depended on ethnic and geographical factors. 
      Previous investigation of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in the Cypriot population, revealed no 
      pathogenic expansion in the Cypriot SCA patients. We hereby present our recent 
      investigation of the SCA10 pentanucleotide repeat expansion. Forty-two 
      ascertained Cypriot sporadic ataxia patients, the index case from 1 ADCA and 14 
      ARCA families and a cohort of normal population individuals were included in the 
      study. All our patients have normal range ATXN10 gene ATTCT repeat numbers 
      (10-19). In the normal population group, repeat lengths ranged from 11 to 20 with 
      the 14 repeats allele being the most frequent. Therefore, all currently 
      established dynamic repeat SCA mutations are absent from the Cypriot population, 
      indicating distinct genetic causes.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease that results from a pathogenic glutamine-repeat expansion in the protein 
      ataxin-1 (ATXN1). Although the functions of ATXN1 are still largely unknown, 
      there is evidence to suggest that ATXN1 plays a role in regulating gene 
      expression, the earliest process known to go awry in SCA1 mouse models. In this 
      study, we show that ATXN1 reduces histone acetylation, a post-translational 
      modification of histones associated with enhanced transcription, and represses 
      histone acetyl transferase-mediated transcription. In addition, we find that 
      depleting the Leucine-rich Acidic Nuclear Protein (LANP)-an ATXN1 binding 
      inhibitor of histone acetylation-reverses aspects of SCA1 neuritic pathology.

TI  - Inherited polyglutamine spinocerebellar ataxias in South Africa.
PG  - 683-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and distribution of polyglutamine 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) from referrals over a 24-year period to the 
      National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) in South Africa (SA). METHODS: 
      Paper-based clinical reports in the University of Cape Town laboratory and the 
      NHLS electronic patient record database spanning a 24-year period were mined for 
      information regarding the molecular diagnosis, ethnicity and CAG repeat length 
      for individuals referred for molecular genetic testing for the polyglutamine 
      SCAs. RESULTS: SCA1 and 7 are the most frequent types of polyglutamine SCA in the 
      SA patient population, followed by SCA2, 3 and 6. SCA1 is the most common type in 
      the coloured, white and Indian populations, whereas the majority of indigenous 
      black African patients are affected with SCA7 and 2. Of individuals tested, 22% 
      were found to be positive for one of the polyglutamine SCAs. CONCLUSION: Although 
      trends in the frequency and distribution of the polyglutamine SCAs in SA have not 
      changed significantly since our previous study in 2003, they differ remarkably 
      from those reported elsewhere, and reflect the unique genetic and demographic 
      background of SA. The provision of accurate and complete patient information and 
      family history is crucial to the diagnostic process, to enable comprehensive 
      epidemiological studies and assist in developing therapeutic and patient 
      management strategies.

      for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.
PG  - 74-82

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias are autosomal dominant diseases, associated in some types 
      with a CAG repeat expansion, and characterised by a progressive loss of motor 
      function. Currently, as there is no cure for most ataxias, treatment 
      predominantly involves physical therapy. Various symptomatic drug treatments have 
      been tried; however, published clinical studies have provided inconsistent 
      results, likely due to small sample sizes, mixed patient populations and 
      insensitive or subjective assessment scales. SCA1(154Q) transgenic mice display 
      motor function impairments and ultimately a reduced number of cerebellar Purkinje 
      neurons-characteristics comparable to most forms of sporadic and hereditary 
      ataxias. We monitored motor function in SCA1(154Q) mice from 5 to 20 weeks of age 
      and assessed the efficacy of four potential cerebellar modulatory drugs in 
      attenuating deficits in rotor-rod performance. The drugs riluzole, amantadine, 
      zolpidem and buspirone were selected based on their different mechanisms of 
      action and their Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/Australian Therapeutic Goods 
      Administration approval for other indications. SCA1(154Q) and C57/Bl6 wild-type 
      mice were administered with four ascending acute doses of each drug, over 2 days. 
      Following each dose, mice were assesed for motor function on the accelerating 
      rotor-rod. None of the four drugs attenuated motor deficts in SCA1(154Q) mice at 
      any dose; at FDA equivalent and higher dose administration of zolpidem and 
      buspirone led to sedation in both strains. Our results suggest that the 
      aforementioned drugs are likely to be ineffective for symptomatic treatment of 
      SCA1 and most other ataxic patients and emphasise the need for comphrehensive 
      drug studies prior to clinical use.

TI  - Analysis of spinocerebellar ataxias due to expanded triplet repeats in Greek 
      patients with cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 178-80
LID - 10.1016/j.jns.2012.03.019 [doi]
AB  - The relative frequency of different autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, 
      commonly referred to as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), varies considerably among 
      populations of different ethnic origin. No data exist at present on the frequency 
      of different SCAs in the Greek population. In the present study we investigated 
      the presence of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in a cohort of 83 Greek patients with slowly 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia. Twenty patients came from autosomal dominant (AD) 
      pedigrees, seven displayed recessive or unclear inheritance and 56 were sporadic. 
      We found four patients with pathological SCA expansions, all from AD pedigrees. 
      Two patients had SCA1, one SCA2 and one SCA7 (10.0, 5.0 and 5.0% of the AD group, 
      respectively). The clinical features of these patients were within the expected 
      spectrum. In total, a pathological expansion was detected in 20% of patients from 
      AD pedigrees. Interestingly, no cases of SCA3 or SCA6 were detected in the AD 
      group. No expansions were found in other familial cases or in sporadic patients. 
      Overall, no cases of SCA3, SCA6, SCA12, SCA17 or DRPLA were identified in the 
      Greek population. In conclusion, SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 are present in Greek 
      patients with AD cerebellar ataxia in frequencies similar to those observed in 
      other populations. SCA3 and SCA6 appear however to be rare in Greece. The genetic 
      cause for the majority of AD ataxias remains to be identified.

TI  - Genetic screening of Greek patients with Huntington's disease phenocopies 
      identifies an SCA8 expansion.
PG  - 1874-8
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a 
      triad of chorea, psychiatric disturbance and cognitive decline. Around 1% of 
      patients with HD-like symptoms lack the causative HD expansion and are considered 
      HD phenocopies. Genetic diseases that can present as HD phenocopies include 
      HD-like syndromes such as HDL1, HDL2 and HDL4 (SCA17), some spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCAs) and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). In this study we 
      screened a cohort of 21 Greek patients with HD phenocopy syndromes formutations 
      causing HDL2, SCA17, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3,SCA8, SCA12 and DRPLA. Fifteen patients 
      (71%) had a positive family history. We identified one patient (4.8% of the total 
      cohort) with an expansion of 81 combined CTA/CTG repeats at the SCA8 locus. This 
      falls within what is believed to be the high-penetrance allele range. In addition 
      to the classic HD triad, the patient had features of dystonia and oculomotor 
      apraxia. There were no cases of HDL2, SCA17, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA12 or DRPLA. 
      Given the controversy surrounding the SCA8 expansion, the present finding may be 
      incidental. However, if pathogenic, it broadens the phenotype that may be 
      associated with SCA8 expansions. The absence of any other mutations in our cohort 
      is not surprising, given the low probability of reaching a genetic diagnosis in 
      HD phenocopy patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain quantitative data on the progression of the most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) and identify factors that influence their 
      progression, we initiated the EUROSCA natural history study, a multicentric 
      longitudinal cohort study of 526 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6. We 
      report the results of the 1- and 2-year follow-up visits. METHODS: As the primary 
      outcome measure we used the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA, 
      0-40), and as a secondary measure the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Symptoms (INAS, 
      0-16) count. RESULTS: The annual increase of the SARA score was greatest in SCA1 
      (2.18 +/- 0.17, mean +/- SE) followed by SCA3 (1.61 +/- 0.12) and SCA2 (1.40 +/- 0.11). 
      SARA progression in SCA6 was slowest and nonlinear (first year: 0.35 +/- 0.34, 
      second year: 1.44 +/- 0.34). Analysis of the INAS count yielded similar results. 
      Larger expanded repeats and earlier age at onset were associated with faster SARA 
      progression in SCA1 and SCA2. In SCA1, repeat length of the expanded allele had a 
      similar effect on INAS progression. In SCA3, SARA progression was influenced by 
      the disease duration at inclusion, and INAS progression was faster in females. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study gives a comprehensive quantitative account of disease 
      progression in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6 and identifies factors that 
      specifically affect disease progression.

TI  - Gray matter volume deficits in spinocerebellar ataxia: an optimized voxel based 
      morphometric study.
PG  - 521-7
LID - 10.1016/j.parkreldis.2011.04.008 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a group of autosomal dominant 
      ataxias with varied clinical phenotypes. However there are no unique 
      distinguishing features on routine neuroimaging among the various genetically 
      defined SCAs. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) provides an automated unbiased 
      analysis of structural MRI scans and gives a comprehensive assessment of 
      anatomical differences throughout the brain. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study 
      were to (i) characterize the patterns of atrophy in SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3 using 
      optimized VBM, (ii) demonstrate the characteristic anatomical differences in 
      these genetically distinct SCA subtypes, and (iii) assess the relationship 
      between morphometric measures and the CAG repeat lengths and other attributes of 
      the disease. METHODS: Thirty-one genetically confirmed patients suffering from 
      SCA (SCA1 - 12, SCA2 - 9, and SCA3 - 10) were studied. High resolution 
      T1-weighted 3-Dimensional Magnetic Resonance Images of 31 patients were analyzed 
      using the optimized VBM procedure. RESULTS: In all the three SCAs there was a 
      significant loss of gray matter in both cerebellar hemispheres and vermis. 
      Vermian atrophy was more pronounced in SCA3, while SCA1 and SCA2 had significant 
      white matter atrophy. Pontine white matter atrophy was more pronounced in SCA2. 
      In SCA1, the severity of ataxia strongly correlated with the degree of gray 
      matter atrophy in cerebellar hemispheres. The duration of symptoms and lengths of 
      CAG repeats had no correlation with the degree of atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study showed that the different subtypes of SCAs may have morphometric 
      differences in the cerebellum, brainstem and the supratentorial structures.

TI  - Determinants of R-loop formation at convergent bidirectionally transcribed 
      trinucleotide repeats.
PG  - 1749-62
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkq935 [doi]
AB  - R-loops have been described at immunoglobulin class switch sequences, prokaryotic 
      and mitochondrial replication origins, and disease-associated (CAG)n and (GAA)n 
      trinucleotide repeats. The determinants of trinucleotide R-loop formation are 
      unclear. Trinucleotide repeat expansions cause diseases including DM1 (CTG)n, 
      SCA1 (CAG)n, FRAXA (CGG)n, FRAXE (CCG)n and FRDA (GAA)n. Bidirectional convergent 
      transcription across these disease repeats can occur. We find R-loops formed when 
      CTG or CGG and their complementary strands CAG or CCG were transcribed; GAA 
      transcription, but not TTC, yielded R-loops. R-loop formation was sensitive to 
      DNA supercoiling, repeat length, insensitive to repeat interruptions, and formed 
      by extension of RNA:DNA hybrids in the RNA polymerase. R-loops arose by 
      transcription in one direction followed by transcription in the opposite 
      direction, and during simultaneous convergent bidirectional transcription of the 
      same repeat forming double R-loop structures. Since each transcribed disease 
      repeat formed R-loops suggests they may have biological functions.

TI  - Exhaustive expansion: A novel technique for analyzing complex data generated by 
      higher-order polychromatic flow cytometry experiments.

LID - 10.1186/1479-5876-8-106 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The complex data sets generated by higher-order polychromatic flow 
      cytometry experiments are a challenge to analyze. Here we describe Exhaustive 
      Expansion, a data analysis approach for deriving hundreds to thousands of cell 
      phenotypes from raw data, and for interrogating these phenotypes to identify 
      populations of biological interest given the experimental context. METHODS: We 
      apply this approach to two studies, illustrating its broad applicability. The 
      first examines the longitudinal changes in circulating human memory T cell 
      populations within individual patients in response to a melanoma peptide 
      (gp100209-2M) cancer vaccine, using 5 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to delineate 
      subpopulations of viable, gp100-specific, CD8+ T cells. The second study measures 
      the mobilization of stem cells in porcine bone marrow that may be associated with 
      wound healing, and uses 5 different staining panels consisting of 8 mAbs each. 
      RESULTS: In the first study, our analysis suggests that the cell surface markers 
      CD45RA, CD27 and CD28, commonly used in historical lower order (2-4 color) flow 
      cytometry analysis to distinguish memory from naive and effector T cells, may not 
      be obligate parameters in defining central memory T cells (TCM). In the second 
      study, we identify novel phenotypes such as CD29+CD31+CD56+CXCR4+CD90+Sca1-CD44+, 
      which may characterize progenitor cells that are significantly increased in 
      wounded animals as compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these 
      results demonstrate that Exhaustive Expansion supports thorough interrogation of 
      complex higher-order flow cytometry data sets and aids in the identification of 
      potentially clinically relevant findings.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (SCA11) is an uncommon cause of dominant ataxia 
      among French and German kindreds.
PG  - 1229-32
LID - 10.1136/jnnp.2009.202150 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: At least 28 loci have been linked to autosomal dominant 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (ADCA). Causative genes have been cloned for 10 nucleotide 
      repeat expansions (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17 and 31) and six genes with 
      classical mutations (SCA5, 13, 14, 15/16, 27 and 28). Recently, a large British 
      pedigree linked to SCA11 has been reported to carry a mutation in the TTBK2 gene. 
      In order to assess the prevalence and phenotypic spectrum of SCA11, the authors 
      screened 148 index patients of predominantly German (n=69) and French (n=79) 
      descent with ADCA tested negative for a panel of SCA mutations (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 
      and 17), for mutations in TTBK2. METHODS: In the German ADCA cohort, the complete 
      coding sequence of the TTBK2 gene was PCR-amplified and screened for mutations by 
      high-resolution-melting (HRM) analysis. In the French cohort, exons known to 
      carry mutations were directly sequenced. For both cohorts, the gene-dosage 
      alterations were assessed using a customised multiplex ligation probe 
      amplification (MLPA) assay. RESULTS: In two of 148 ADCA families--one German and 
      one French--the authors identified a potentially disease-causing SCA11 mutation. 
      Interestingly, both carried an identical two-basepair deletion (c.1306_1307delGA, 
      p.D435fs448X in exon 12) leading to a premature stop codon. Gene-dosage 
      alterations were not detected in the TTBK2 gene. Clinically, the SCA11 patients 
      had phenotypic characteristics as described before presenting with slowly 
      progressive almost pure cerebellar ataxia with normal life expectancy. 
      CONCLUSION: SCA11 presented as ADCA III according to Harding's classification and 
      is a rare cause of spinocerebellar ataxia in Caucasians accounting for less than 
      1% of dominant ataxias in central Europe.

PG  - 1124-32
LID - S0004-282X2009000600034 [pii]
AB  - The diagnosis and incidence of spinocerebelar ataxias (SCA) is sometimes 
      difficult to analyze due the overlap of phenotypes subtypes and are disorders of 
      mutations caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion. To investigate the 
      incidence of the SCA in Southern Brazil, we analyzed the trinucleotide repeats 
      (CAG)n at the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7 loci to identify allele size ranges 
      and frequencies. We examined blood sample from 154 asymptomatic blood donors and 
      115 individuals with progressive ataxias. PCR products were submitted to 
      capillary electrophoresis. In the blood donors, the ranges of the five loci were: 
      SCA1, 19 to 36 (CAG)n; SCA2, 6 to 28 (CAG)n; SCA3, 12 to 34 (CAG)n; SCA6, 2 to 13 
      (CAG)n; and SCA7, 2 to 10 (CAG)n. No deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
      were detected. In the ataxia group, we found (CAG)n above the range of the 
      asymptomatic blood donors in SCA3 (21.74%) followed by SCA2 (5.22%), SCA7 
      (2.61%), SCA6 (0.87%), and no cases of SCA1. The remaining 80 cases (69.56%) have 
      different diagnoses from the type here studied. These data defined the alleles 
      and their frequencies, as well as demonstrated their stability in the population 
      not affected. The molecular diagnosis test confirmed the clinical diagnosis in 
      28/45 cases and classified another 7/70 from the clinical unclassified ataxias 
      group.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Biomarkers to monitor neurological dysfunction in 
      autosomal dominant inherited spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are lacking. We 
      therefore aimed to visualize, quantify and correlate localized brain atrophy with 
      clinical symptoms in SCA1, SCA3, and SCA6. METHODS: We compared patients 
      suffering from SCA1 (n=48), SCA3 (n=24), and SCA6 (n=10) with 32 controls using 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on four different scanners in eight centers 
      followed by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and quantitative three-dimensional (3D) 
      volumetry. RESULTS: SCA1 and SCA3 patients presented with severe atrophy in total 
      brainstem (consisting of midbrain, pons, and medulla), pons, medulla, total 
      cerebellum, cerebellar hemispheres and cerebellar vermis, putamen and caudate 
      nucleus. Atrophy in the cerebellar hemispheres was less severe in SCA3 than in 
      SCA1 and SCA6. Atrophy in SCA6 was restricted to the grey matter of the 
      cerebellum (VBM and volumetry), total brainstem and pons (volumetry only). 
      Overall, we did not observe substantial atrophy in the cerebral cortex. A 
      discriminant analysis taking into account data from pons, cerebellar hemispheres, 
      medulla, midbrain and putamen achieved a reclassification probability of 81.7% 
      for SCA1, SCA3, and SCA6. The repeat length of the expanded allele showed a weak 
      negative correlation with the volume of the brainstem, pons, caudate nucleus and 
      putamen in SCA3, and a weak correlation with the pons in SCA1, whereas no such 
      correlation was found in SCA6. Clinical dysfunction as measured by the Scale for 
      the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and the Unified Huntington's Disease 
      Rating Scale functional assessment correlated best with the atrophy of pons in 
      SCA1, with total brainstem atrophy in SCA3 and atrophy of total cerebellum in 
      SCA6. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide strong evidence that MRI is an attractive 
      surrogate marker for clinical studies of SCA. In each SCA genotype clinical 
      dysfunction may be caused by different patho-anatomical processes.

AB  - Recent studies of inherited neurodegenerative disorders have suggested a linkage 
      between the propensity toward aggregation of mutant protein and disease onset. 
      This is particularly apparent for polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases caused by 
      expansion of CAG-trinucleotide repeats. However, a quantitative framework for 
      relating aggregation kinetics with molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration 
      initiation is lacking. Here, using the repeat-length-dependent age-of-onset in 
      polyQ diseases, we derived a mathematical model based on nucleation of 
      aggregation kinetics to describe genotype-phenotype correlations, and validated 
      the model using both in vitro data and clinical data. Instead of describing polyQ 
      aggregation kinetics with a derivative equation, our model divided age-of-onset 
      (equivalent to the time required for aggregation) into two processes: nucleation 
      lag time (a first-order exponential function of CAG-repeat length) and elongation 
      time. With the exception of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 3, the relation between 
      CAG-repeat length and age-of-onset in all examined polyQ diseases, including 
      Huntington's disease, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and SCA1, -2, -6 and 
      -7, could be well explained by three parameters derived from linear regression 
      analysis based on the nucleated growth polymerization model. These parameters 
      composed of probability of nucleation at an individual repeat, a protein 
      concentration associated factor, and elongation time predict the overall features 
      of neurodegeneration initiation, including constant risk for cell death, toxic 
      polyQ species, main pathological subcellular site and the contribution of 
      cellular factors. Our model also presents an alternative therapeutic strategy 
      according to the distinct subcellular loci by the finding that nuclear 
      localization of soluble mutant protein monomers itself has great impact on 
      disease onset.

LID - 10.1007/s10815-009-9325-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The lengths of CAG repeats in two spinocerebellar ataxia genes, SCA1 and 
      SCA3, were analyzed to determine whether such repeats exist in higher numbers in 
      infertile males. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from healthy controls, 
      oligozoospermia patients, and azoospermia patients. DNA fragments containing 
      target CAG repeats were amplified by PCR with template DNA purified from the 
      blood samples. CAG repeats in PCR fragments were determined, using ABI PRISM 310 
      Gene Analyzer. RESULTS: In SCA1, the distribution of CAG repeats in 
      oligozoospermic males was different from that of the control group: More alleles 
      had a repeat number that exceeded 32. Conversely, for SCA3, the examined 
      oligozoospermia and azoospermia patients exhibited no differences in distribution 
      of CAG repeats in comparison with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: SCA1 in a 
      subset of oligozoospermia patients has an increased number of CAG repeats.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of spinocerebellar ataxias in Cuba: insights into SCA2 
      founder effect in Holguin.
PG  - 157-60
LID - 10.1016/j.neulet.2009.03.015 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of hereditary ataxias 
      in Cuba, with a special focus on the clinical and molecular features of SCA2. 
      Clinical assessments were performed by neurological examinations and application 
      of the SARA scale. Molecular analyses of genes SCA1-3, SCA6, SCA17 and DRPLA 
      identified 753 patients with SCA and 7173 asymptomatic relatives, belonging to 
      200 unrelated families. 86.79% of all SCA patients were affected with SCA2. In 
      the Holguin province, the average population prevalence of SCA2 is 40.18x10(5) 
      inhabitants, with the remarkable figure of 141.66x10(5) in the Baguanos 
      municipality. The high prevalence of the SCA2 mutation in Holguin reflects most 
      likely a founder effect. The stabilization of the prevalence along time suggests 
      the existence of premutated chromosomes with pure CAG, acting as reservoir for 
      further expansions. CAG repeat length correlated inversely with age at onset, 
      accounting for 80% of the variability. Genetic anticipation was observed in the 
      80% of transmissions. Repeat instability was greater in paternal transmissions 
      whereas CAG expansions without anticipation was observed in 10.97% suggesting the 
      effect of CAA interruptions in the CAG segment, which decrease the toxicity of 
      the abnormal ataxin-2, and/or other protective factors.

TI  - SCA-LSVD: a repeat-oriented locus-specific variation database for genotype to

PG  - 1037-42
LID - 10.1002/humu.21006 [doi]
AB  - Repeat expansion has been implicated in 10 out of 17 candidate genes identified 
      for autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs)-commonly referred as 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Though genetically distinct, the SCAs share a 
      large number of features that confound their clinical classification. In 
      addition, there is a difference in the prevalence and phenotypic expression of 
      ataxias between different ethnic groups. We have created a new SCA-locus-specific 
      variation database (LSVD) that aims to catalog and integrate information on SCAs 
      associated with trinucleotide repeat expansion (SCA1, SCA 2, SCA 3, SCA 6, SCA 7, 
      SCA 8, SCA 12, SCA 17, Friedreich's ataxia [FRDA], and 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA]) from all over the world. The 
      database has been developed using the Leiden Open (source) Variation Database 
      (LOVD) software (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands). The 
      database houses detailed information on clinical features, such as age and 
      symptom at onset, mode of inheritance, and genotype information, pertaining to 
      the SCA patients from more than 400 families across India. All the compiled 
      genotype data conforms to the HGVS Nomenclature guidelines. This would be a very 
      useful starting point for understanding the molecular correlates of phenotypes in 
      ataxia-a multilocus disease in which related molecular mechanisms converge to 
      overlapping phenotypes.

      disease at presentation correlates with size of CAG repeat lengths.
PG  - 83-6
LID - 10.1016/j.jns.2008.10.016 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the correlation, if any, 
      between the clinical rate of disease progression at presentation with the CAG 
      repeat size in patients with spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 2 and 3 (SCA1, SCA2 and 
      SCA3). METHODS: The severity of ataxia was measured using the International 
      Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (IARS) in 31 patients of SCA1 (mean+/-SD age: 
      35.1+/-12.6 years; age at onset (AAO): 29.9+/-10.7 years), 25 patients of SCA2 
      (age: 34.9+/-14.9 years; AAO: 29.7+/-14.0 years) and 15 patients of SCA3 (age: 
      40.9+/-8.6 years; AAO: 36.9+/-10.1). The rate of disease progression at 
      presentation was measured by the age adjusted IARS (IARS/Age). For each SCA, 
      correlations of AAO, raw scores of IARS, age adjusted IARS and duration adjusted 
      IARS (IARS/Duration) with the CAG repeat size were determined. RESULTS: The 
      number of CAG repeats of the abnormal allele ranged from 42 to 67 in SCA1, 38 to 
      66 in SCA2, and 69 to 79 in SCA3. In all the three types of SCAs, there were 
      significant inverse correlations of AAO with CAG repeat size (SCA1: r=-0.9, 
      p<0.0001; SCA2: r=-0.7, p<0.0001; SCA3:-0.8, p=0.0003) and significant positive 
      correlations of IARS/Age with CAG repeat size (SCA1: r=0.6, p=0.0015; SCA2: 
      r=0.9, p<0.0001; SCA3:0.7, p=0.0057). However, the raw IARS scores and the 
      duration adjusted IARS scores did not correlate significantly with the CAG repeat 
      sizes. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the rate of clinical disease 
      progression at presentation, especially in SCA2, is dependent on the CAG repeat 
      size, and may commence linearly from birth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Quantitative assessment of balance in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 
      (SCA1). BACKGROUND: Evaluation of balance in degenerative ataxias is often 
      clinical and subject to bias. Quantification of balance is crucial for evaluating 
      the efficacy of therapeutic and rehabilitative interventions. METHODS: The 
      subjects were 20 patients (males: 14, females: 6) with genetically positive SCA1 
      and 20 age and gender matched healthy subjects. Ataxia was rated using the 
      International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). Balance was assessed by 
      dynamic posturography (Biodex, USA) which included: (a) ability to control 
      balance in all directions (overall balance index, OBI), front to back 
      (anterior-posterior index, API) and side-to-side (medio-lateral index, MLI); and 
      (b) the limits of stability (LOS) in all directions. Balance index was considered 
      abnormal if the actual value exceeded the predictive value. RESULTS: Impaired 
      balance was found in 80% of patients (all indices in 35%, OBI+API in 25%, only 
      OBI in 15%, and OBI+MLI in 5%). Compared to controls, SCA1 patients had 
      significantly higher balance indices and lower LOS scores. Unlike in controls, 
      the mean value of API was significantly higher than MLI in SCA1. LOS was found to 
      the best predictor of balance abnormality. In patients, all balance indices had 
      significant positive correlations with ICARS, static score of ICARS, body weight, 
      severity and duration of illness, but not with the CAG repeat length. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SCA1 had global impairment of balance, with greater 
      instability in anterior-posterior than medio-lateral directions. Apart from 
      severity and duration of illness, body weight was detriment to maintenance of 
      balance in SCA1. This information may be useful in planning balance 
      rehabilitation in SCA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) has been related to mutations associated 
      with spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA); the frequency of the diagnosis of these 
      mutations is low in general late-onset PD cases. Our aim was to investigate a 
      selected high-risk group of PD patients. METHODS: PD patients with autosomal 
      dominant inheritance or atypical neurological manifestations were enrolled, 
      underwent a full neurological examination and had the CAG tracts of their SCA1, 
      2, 3, 6 and 7 genes analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 23 studied families, two SCA3 and 
      one SCA2 cases were identified. All had autosomal dominant inheritance. In the 
      SCA2 pedigree, four affected sibs had a homogeneous PD phenotype. CAG repeats 
      varied between 35 and 44 with CAA interruptions. Intrafamilial phenotypic 
      heterogeneity was identified in the SCA3 pedigrees; parkinsonian and ataxic 
      phenotypes coexisted in both kindreds. CAGn varied between 69 and 71 repeats. Age 
      of onset was lower in the SCA3 patients than in the remaining 24 cases (38 versus 
      46.7+/-12 years of age, p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: SCA2 and SCA3 mutations were 
      detected in 13% of the present sample: the strategy of selecting a high-risk 
      group increased the rate of making these diagnoses. The SCA2 cases confirmed an 
      association between PD and interrupted expansions, as well as PD intrafamilial 
      phenotypic homogeneity. Clinical heterogeneity of SCA3 pedigrees suggests that 
      disease-modifying agents outside the MJD1 gene may play a role in determining PD 
      symptoms in this disorder.

AB  - Onset of genetically determined neurodegenerative diseases is difficult to 
      specify because of their insidious and slowly progressive nature. This is 
      especially true for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) because of varying affection of 
      many parts of the nervous system and huge variability of symptoms. We 
      investigated early symptoms in 287 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 and 
      calculated the influence of CAG repeat length on age of onset depending on (1) 
      the definition of disease onset, (2) people defining onset, and (3) duration of 
      symptoms. Gait difficulty was the initial symptom in two-thirds of patients. 
      Double vision, dysarthria, impaired hand writing, and episodic vertigo preceded 
      ataxia in 4% of patients, respectively. Frequency of other early symptoms did not 
      differ from controls and was regarded unspecific. Data about disease onset varied 
      between patients and relatives for 1 year or more in 44% of cases. Influence of 
      repeat length on age of onset was maximum when onset was defined as beginning of 
      permanent gait disturbance and cases with symptoms for more than 10 years were 
      excluded. Under these conditions, CAG repeat length determined 64% of onset 
      variability in SCA1, 67% in SCA2, 46% in SCA3, and 41% in SCA6 demonstrating 
      substantial influence of nonrepeat factors on disease onset in all SCA subtypes. 
      Identification of these factors is of interest as potential targets for disease 
      modifying compounds. In this respect, recognition of early symptoms that develop 
      before onset of ataxia is mandatory to determine the shift from presymptomatic to 
      affected status in SCA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that determine disease severity and clinical 
      phenotype of the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), we studied 526 
      patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3. or SCA6. METHODS: To measure the severity of 
      ataxia we used the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). In 
      addition, nonataxia symptoms were assessed with the Inventory of Non-Ataxia 
      Symptoms (INAS). The INAS count denotes the number of nonataxia symptoms in each 
      patient. RESULTS: An analysis of covariance with SARA score as dependent variable 
      and repeat lengths of the expanded and normal allele, age at onset, and disease 
      duration as independent variables led to multivariate models that explained 60.4% 
      of the SARA score variance in SCA1, 45.4% in SCA2, 46.8% in SCA3, and 33.7% in 
      SCA6. In SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3, SARA was mainly determined by repeat length of the 
      expanded allele, age at onset, and disease duration. The only factors determining 
      the SARA score in SCA6 were age at onset and disease duration. The INAS count was 
      5.0 +/- 2.3 in SCA1, 4.6 +/- 2.2 in SCA2, 5.2 +/- 2.5 in SCA3, and 2.0 +/- 1.7 in 
      SCA6. In SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3, SARA score and disease duration were the strongest 
      predictors of the INAS count. In SCA6, only age at onset and disease duration had 
      an effect on the INAS count. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) 1, SCA2, and SCA3 share a number of common biologic properties, 
      whereas SCA6 is distinct in that its phenotype is more determined by age than by 
      disease-related factors.

LID - 10.1007/s12311-008-0023-2 [doi]
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of autosomal 
      dominantly inherited progressive ataxia diseases. Up to now, almost 30 different 
      gene loci have been found. In 14 of them, the underlying mutations have been 
      identified. The more common SCAs, SCA1, 2, 3 and 6 are due to translated CAG 
      repeat expansions that code for an elongated polyglutamine tract within the 
      respective proteins. These diseases belong to a larger group of polyglutamine 
      disorders that also includes Huntington's disease. Epidemiological studies 
      conducted in different European regions found prevalence rates of SCAs ranging 
      from 0.9 to 3.0:100,000. In all SCAs, ataxia is the prominent symptom. However, 
      the majority have a complex phenotype in which ataxia is accompanied by varying 
      non-ataxia symptoms. In all ataxia patients with proven or suspected autosomal 
      dominant mode of inheritance, the available molecular genetic tests for SCA 
      mutations should be performed. Depending on the geographical origin of the 
      family, these tests will lead to positive diagnostic results in at least half of 
      the families.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) comprise a clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorders 
      affecting the cerebellum and to variable degrees further parts of the nervous 
      system. Electrophysiology is a potent tool to prove impairment of multiple 
      neuronal systems and fibre tracts and even to decipher subclinical affection. 
      Electrooculography, evoked potentials, nerve conduction studies and 
      polysomnography are especially helpful in the setting of SCAs. Severely slowed 
      saccades are a hallmark of SCA2. Vertical nystagmus occurs most frequently in 
      SCA3 and SCA6. Visual potentials recede especially in SCA7. Substantially 
      prolonged central motor conduction times in motor-evoked potentials occur 
      frequently in SCA1 even in patients without clinical signs of pyramidal 
      affection. Thus, electrophysiological analyses may help to predict the SCA 
      genotype and direct molecular genetic diagnostics. Polysomnography is a helpful 
      tool in the analysis of sleep disorders and frequently helps to decipher 
      treatable causes like periodic leg movement in sleep and REM sleep behaviour 
      disorder in SCAs. Nerve conduction studies reveal sensory neuropathy in all 
      common SCA subtypes, but to variable degrees. Age rather than CAG repeat length 
      appears to be the most important determinant for neuropathy and makes sensory 
      nerve action potentials a potential progression marker in SCA.

      contribute to SCA1.
PG  - 713-8
LID - 10.1038/nature06731 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by expansion of a glutamine-encoding repeat in ataxin 1 (ATXN1). 
      In all known polyglutamine diseases, the glutamine expansion confers toxic 
      functions onto the protein; however, the mechanism by which this occurs remains 
      enigmatic, in light of the fact that the mutant protein apparently maintains 
      interactions with its usual partners. Here we show that the expanded 
      polyglutamine tract differentially affects the function of the host protein in 
      the context of different endogenous protein complexes. Polyglutamine expansion in 
      ATXN1 favours the formation of a particular protein complex containing RBM17, 
      contributing to SCA1 neuropathology by means of a gain-of-function mechanism. 
      Concomitantly, polyglutamine expansion attenuates the formation and function of 
      another protein complex containing ATXN1 and capicua, contributing to SCA1 
      through a partial loss-of-function mechanism. This model provides mechanistic 
      insight into the molecular pathogenesis of SCA1 as well as other polyglutamine 
      diseases.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 is a rare autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia 
      (ADCA). Herein, we describe the molecular and clinical findings in patients 
      within six generations of a large Chinese family with spinocerebellar ataxia. To 
      identify the genetic cause(s), 4 affected patients and 26 asymptomatic relatives 
      were recruited for the study. Molecular screening of the SCA1 and SCA7 genes was 
      carried out by subcloning and direct PCR-sequencing methods. Both neurological 
      and ophthalmic examinations were performed to investigate the clinical 
      characteristics of the disease. The patients had typical cerebellar ataxia, 
      achromatopsia and macular degeneration, and displayed a rare phenotype 
      manifesting as a combination of cerebellar ataxia and craniocervical dystonia. 
      Mutational analysis of the SCA7 genes demonstrated expanded CAG-repeats in the 
      four patients. In conclusion, we identified expanded CAG-repeats in the SCA7 gene 
      within members of a large Chinese family with spinocerebellar ataxia. The defined 
      phenotypic characteristics of the patients may be helpful for clinical diagnosis 
      and genetic typing of new patients.

      analysis".
PG  - 287-295

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1; OMIM: #164400) is an autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia caused by an expansion of CAG repeat, which encodes 
      polyglutamine, in the ataxin-1 (ATXN1) gene. Length of polyglutamine in the ATXN1 
      protein is the critical determinant of pathogenesis of this disease. Molecular 
      diagnosis of SCA1 is usually undertaken by assessing the length of CAG repeat 
      configuration using primers spanning this configuration. However, this 
      conventional method may potentially lead to misdiagnosis in assessing 
      polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat length, since CAT interruptions may be present 
      within the CAG repeat configuration, not only in normal controls but also in 
      neurologically symptomatic subjects. We developed a new method for assessing 
      actual CAG repeat numbers not interrupted by CAT sequences. Polymerase chain 
      reaction using a primer pair labeled with two different fluorescences followed by 
      restriction enzyme digestion with SfaNI which recognizes the sequence 
      "GCATC(N)(5)", lengths of actual CAG repeats that encode polyglutamine were 
      directly detected. We named this method "dual fluorescence labeled 
      PCR-restriction fragment length analysis". We found that numbers of actual CAG 
      repeat encoding polyglutamine do not overlap between our cohorts of normal 
      chromosomes (n=385) and SCA1 chromosomes (n=5). We conclude that the present 
      method is a useful way for molecular diagnosis of SCA1.

TI  - Dnmt1 deficiency promotes CAG repeat expansion in the mouse germline.
PG  - 1306-17
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddn019 [doi]
AB  - Expanded CAG repeat tracts are the cause of at least a dozen neurodegenerative 
      disorders. In humans, long CAG repeats tend to expand during transmissions from 
      parent to offspring, leading to an earlier age of disease onset and more severe 
      symptoms in subsequent generations. Here, we show that the maintenance DNA 
      methyltransferase Dnmt1, which preserves the patterns of CpG methylation, plays a 
      key role in CAG repeat instability in human cells and in the male and female 
      mouse germlines. SiRNA knockdown of Dnmt1 in human cells destabilized CAG triplet 
      repeats, and Dnmt1 deficiency in mice promoted intergenerational expansion of CAG 
      repeats at the murine spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (Sca1) locus. Importantly, 
      Dnmt1(+/-) SCA1 mice, unlike their Dnmt1(+/+) SCA1 counterparts, closely 
      reproduced the intergenerational instability patterns observed in human SCA1 
      patients. In addition, we found aberrant DNA and histone methylation at sites 
      within the CpG island that abuts the expanded repeat tract in Dnmt1-deficient 
      mice. These studies suggest that local chromatin structure may play a role in 
      triplet repeat instability. These results are consistent with normal epigenetic 
      changes during germline development contributing to intergenerational instability 
      of CAG repeats in mice and in humans.

TI  - Polyglutamine expansion accelerates the dynamics of ataxin-1 and does not result 
      in aggregate formation.
PG  - e1503
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0001503 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polyglutamine expansion disorders are caused by an expansion of the 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the disease related protein, leading to severe 
      neurodegeneration. All polyQ disorders are hallmarked by the presence of 
      intracellular aggregates containing the expanded protein in affected neurons. The 
      polyQ disorder SpinoCerebellar Ataxia 1 (SCA1) is caused by a polyQ-expansion in 
      the ataxin-1 protein, which is thought to lead to nuclear aggregates. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using advanced live cell fluorescence microscopy 
      and a filter retardation assay we show that nuclear accumulations formed by 
      polyQ-expanded ataxin-1 do not resemble aggregates of other polyQ-expanded 
      proteins. Instead of being static, insoluble aggregates, nuclear accumulations 
      formed by the polyQ-expanded ataxin-1 showed enhanced intracellular kinetics as 
      compared to wild-type ataxin-1. During mitosis, ataxin-1 accumulations 
      redistributed equally among daughter cells, in contrast to polyQ aggregates. 
      Interestingly, polyQ expansion did not affect the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling 
      of ataxin-1 as proposed before. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate 
      that polyQ expansion does not necessarily lead to aggregate formation, and that 
      the enhanced kinetics may affect the nuclear function of ataxin-1. The unexpected 
      findings for a polyQ-expanded protein and their consequences for ongoing SCA1 
      research are discussed.

TI  - Molecular analysis of CAG repeats at five different spinocerebellar ataxia loci: 
      correlation and alternative explanations for disease pathogenesis.
PG  - 338-42
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are caused by expansion of (CAG)n triplet repeats. 
      These repeats occur as polymorphic forms in general population; however, beyond a 
      threshold size they become pathogenic. The sizes and distributions of repeats at 
      the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA7 and DRPLA loci were assessed by molecular analysis of 
      124 unrelated ataxia patients and 44 controls, and the association of larger 
      normal (LN) alleles with disease prevalence was evaluated. Triplet repeat 
      expansions in the disease range were detected in 8% (10/124) of the cases, with 
      the majority having expansion at the SCA1 locus. Normal allele ranges in the 
      cohort studied were similar to the Caucasian and North Indian populations but 
      differed from the Korean and Japanese populations at various loci. The percentage 
      of individuals with LN alleles at the SCA1 and SCA2 loci was higher than reported 
      in Indians, Japanese and Caucasians. LN alleles showed a good correlation with 
      the incidence of SCA1, indicating that SCA1 is the most prevalent ataxia in our 
      population. The majority of cases with clinical symptoms of SCA could not be 
      diagnosed by established CAG repeat criteria, suggesting that there may be an 
      alternative basis for disease pathogenesis: (i) Repeats lower than the normal 
      range may also result in abnormal phenotypes (ii) LN alleles at different loci in 
      the same individual may contribute to symptoms (iii) Exogenous factors may play a 
      role in triggering disease symptoms in individuals with LN alleles (iv) Triplet 
      repeats may reach the disease range in the brain but not in the blood.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias type 1, 2 and 3: a study of heart rate variability.
PG  - 337-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect cardiac autonomic dysfunction, using analysis of heart rate 
      variability in genetically defined spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA). MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Consecutive RR intervals were analyzed for time- and frequency-domain 
      parameters in 22 genotypically proven SCA patients (SCA1 = 11, SCA2 = 6 and SCA3 
      = 5) and compared with that of age- and gender-matched controls. RESULTS: 
      Reduction in the standard deviation of RR interval (RR_SD) was seen in 72.7% of 
      SCA patients. There was a reduction in both the parasympathetic and sympathetic 
      parameters in SCA without any change in the ratio of low- to high-frequency 
      power. In SCA1, there was a significant negative correlation between RR_SD and 
      duration of illness but not with the CAG repeat lengths of the abnormal allele. 
      Small sample size of SCA2 and SCA3 precluded similar comparison. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Cardiac autonomic dysfunction, predominantly parasympathetic, was seen in SCA, 
      and the severity correlated with the duration of illness in SCA1.

TI  - Case control analysis of repeat expansion size in ataxia.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurological diseases. The expansion of unstable microsatellite 
      repeats has been identified as the underlying pathogenic cause of 10 subtypes of 
      autosomal dominant SCAs. The aetiology of sporadic SCA is unknown. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effect of large normal repeats in patients 
      presenting with sporadic or familial ataxia compared to a control population. The 
      size of the expansion was determined using a fluorescent PCR approach in 10 
      common SCA genes: SCA-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 (CACNA1A), 
      SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), SCA-17 (TBP) 
      and DRPLA (ATN1), in 165 ataxia patients and 307 controls of Welsh origin. There 
      was no difference between cases and controls in the distribution of the large 
      normal alleles, or in the distribution of the combined CAG repeats. The normal 
      allele distribution in the Welsh population was largely similar to that of other 
      Caucasian populations. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of large normal 
      repeats on the susceptibility to develop ataxia.

TI  - Multiplex families with multiple system atrophy.
PG  - 545-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) has been considered a sporadic disease, 
      without patterns of inheritance. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of 
      4 multiplex families with MSA, including clinical genetic aspects. DESIGN: 
      Clinical and genetic study. SETTING: Four departments of neurology in Japan. 
      Patients Eight patients in 4 families with parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and 
      autonomic failure with age at onset ranging from 58 to 72 years. Two siblings in 
      each family were affected with these conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical 
      evaluation was performed according to criteria by Gilman et al. Trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the responsible genes for the spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 
      series and for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) was evaluated by 
      polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequence analysis of coding regions in the 
      alpha-synuclein gene was performed. RESULTS: Consanguineous marriage was observed 
      in 1 of 4 families. Among 8 patients, 1 had definite MSA, 5 had probable MSA, and 
      2 had possible MSA. The most frequent phenotype was MSA with predominant 
      parkinsonism, observed in 5 patients. Six patients showed pontine atrophy with 
      cross sign or slitlike signal change at the posterolateral putaminal margin or 
      both on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Possibilities of hereditary ataxias, 
      including SCA1 (ataxin 1, ATXN1), SCA2 (ATXN2), Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3 
      (ATXN1), SCA6 (ATXN1), SCA7 (ATXN7), SCA12 (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory 
      subunit B, beta isoform; PP2R2B), SCA17 (TATA box binding protein, TBP) and DRPLA 
      (atrophin 1; ATN1), were excluded, and no mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene 
      were found. CONCLUSIONS: Findings in these multiplex families suggest the 
      presence of familial MSA with autosomal recessive inheritance and a genetic 
      predisposition to MSA. Molecular genetic approaches focusing on familial MSA are 
      expected to provide clues to the pathogenesis of MSA.

TI  - Cardiac stem cells: isolation, expansion and experimental use for myocardial 
      regeneration.
PG  - S9-S14
AB  - Cellular cardiomyoplasty (myogenic cell grafting) is actively being explored as a 
      novel method to regenerate damaged myocardium. The adult human heart contains 
      small populations of indigenous committed cardiac stem cells or multipotent 
      cardiac progenitor cells, identified by their cell-surface expression of c-kit 
      (the receptor for stem cell factor), P-glycoprotein (a member of the multidrug 
      resistance protein family), and Sca-1 (stem cell antigen 1, a mouse hematopoietic 
      stem cell marker) or a Sca-1-like protein. Cardiac stem cells represent a logical 
      source to exploit in cardiac regeneration therapy because, unlike other adult 
      stem cells, they are likely to be intrinsically programmed to generate cardiac 
      tissue in vitro and to increase cardiac tissue viability in vitro. Cardiac stem 
      cell therapy could, therefore, change the fundamental approach to the treatment 
      of heart disease.

PG  - 73-9
AB  - Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) has a strong hereditary component, but an 
      understanding of predisposition genes is poor. Anticipation with familial CLL has 
      been reported, although the molecular mechanism is unknown. Expansion of 
      trinucleotide repeat sequences underlies anticipation observed in 
      neurodegenerative disease. A polymerase chain reaction-based assay was used to 
      analyse the stability of ten CCG- and CAG-trinucleotide repeat tracts in 18 CLL 
      families and 140 patients with the sporadic form of the disease. The study 
      suggests that anticipation, if it occurs in CLL, is not linked to CCG- and 
      CAG-repeat expansion, however, variation in repeat length at certain loci 
      (FRA16A) may permit identification of susceptible family members. In addition, 
      polymorphisms with prognostic significance were identified. These were high 
      length (but not expanded) repeats at FRA11B (P = 0.01), ATXN1 (P = 0.032) and 
      ATXN3 (P = 0.022), all associated with poor risk disease.

TI  - Effects of SCA1, MJD, and DPRLA triplet repeat polymorphisms on cognitive 
      phenotypes in a normal population of adolescent twins.
PG  - 95-100
AB  - The expansion of unstable trinucleotide CAG repeat polymorphisms of a number of 
      genes causes several neurodegenerative disorders with decreased cognitive 
      function, the severity of the disorder being related to allele length at the 
      triplet repeat locus. While the effects of repeat length have been well studied 
      in clinical samples, there has been little investigation of the effects of 
      triplet repeat variation in the normal range for these genes. We have, therefore, 
      examined linkage and association for three CAG triplet repeat markers 
      (Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1, SCA1; Machado-Joseph Disease, MJD; 
      Dentatorubro-pallidoluysian Atrophy, DRPLA) to assess their contribution to 
      variation in cognitive ability (IQ, reading ability, processing speed) in a 
      normal, unselected sample of adolescent twins (248 dizygotic (DZ) sibling pairs, 
      aged 16 years). Association tests, performed in Mx and QTDT, showed a consistent 
      positive association of SCA1 with Arithmetic (P = 0.04). While association was 
      supported between SCA1 and Cambridge reading scores and between DRPLA and 
      inspection time, results were inconsistent across software packages. Given the 
      number of statistical tests performed, it is unlikely that trinucleotide repeat 
      variation in the normal range for these genes influences variation in normal 
      cognition.

TI  - Pten deletion leads to the expansion of a prostatic stem/progenitor cell 
      subpopulation and tumor initiation.
PG  - 1480-5
AB  - PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is a potent tumor 
      suppressor gene frequently mutated in human prostate cancers. Deletion of Pten in 
      a murine model of prostate cancer recapitulates the disease progression seen in 
      humans. Using defined cell lineage markers, we demonstrate that PTEN negatively 
      regulates p63-positive prostatic basal cell proliferation without blocking 
      differentiation. Concomitant with basal cell proliferation is the expansion of a 
      prostate stem/progenitor-like subpopulation as evidenced by the progressive 
      increase of stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1)- and BCL-2-positive cells. This 
      observation provides strong evidence that basal cell proliferation can be an 
      initiating event for precancerous lesions. Sca-1(+) and BCL-2(+) progenitors may 
      serve as cancer-initiating cells in this model.

TI  - CAG repeats in Restless Legs syndrome.
PG  - 173-6
AB  - Recent reports established an association of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1, 2, and 3. To evaluate the contribution of 
      SCA alleles to idiopathic RLS we investigated the CAG repeat length at the SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17 loci in 215 patients who fulfilled the clinical 
      criteria of RLS and presented periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS) in 
      polysomnographic recording. Fifty percent of patients had a positive family 
      history of RLS. We found one intermediate (CAG)(43) allele for SCA17 in a 
      44-year-old female with RLS starting at the age of 43. Neurologic examination and 
      family history were unremarkable in this patient. Otherwise, allele distribution 
      did not differ between RLS patients and healthy controls. Stratification for age, 
      age of onset, sex, peripheral neuropathy, and sporadic or familial RLS revealed 
      no effect. Thus, CAG repeat length in the investigated genes is not a major 
      determinant of idiopathic or familial RLS.

TI  - Insights into the mutational history and prevalence of SCA1 in the Indian 
      population through anchored polymorphisms.
PG  - 107-14
AB  - There is a wide variation in prevalence of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) 
      in different populations. In the present study, we observed SCA1 in approximately 
      22% (37/167 families) of the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) in the 
      Indian population. We investigated the role of various genetic factors like 
      repeat length, interruption pattern and chromosomal background in predisposing 
      the repeats to instability in these families. We analyzed 12 markers (9 SNPs and 
      3 microsatellite markers) and found 3 of them, spanning a region of approximately 
      65 kbp to be linked with the disease locus in the Indian population. The 
      haplotype C-4-C defined by rs1476464 (SNP9)-D6S288-rs2075974 (SNP1), which was 
      extremely rare in nonaffected chromosomes (approximately 3%), was observed to be 
      significantly (P<0.0000) associated with the expanded chromosomes in 
      approximately 44% of SCA1 families. This haplotype was found in all nonhuman 
      primates. SNP1 (C/T), which showed a skewed allelic distribution between large 
      (LN > 30 repeats) and small normal (SN <or= 30 repeats) alleles (P<0.0000) had 
      similar allelic distribution (P=0.3477) in LN and expanded alleles. Our study 
      suggested that LN and expanded chromosomes linked with the ancestral C allele of 
      SNP1 might have originated simultaneously during evolution by the lengthening of 
      repeats. The LN alleles might have accumulated repeat stabilizing non-CAG 
      interruptions during this process. Similar proportions of T allele in SN with 
      single interruptions, LN and expanded chromosomes lend credence to the origin of 
      expanded alleles from singly-interrupted chromosomes. Our analyses using markers 
      linked (anchoring) to SCA1 suggest that prevalence of SCA1 is correlated to both 
      repeat length and number of interruptions in the Indian population. The spectrum 
      of these alleles also points toward the antiquity of SCA1 mutation in the Indian 
      population.

PG  - 325-8
AB  - We report on a family with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), in which the age 
      at onset and the severity of the disease do not correlate with the number of CAG 
      repeat units. Although a marked anticipation was observed in the proband, it was 
      not a consequence of an expansion of the CAG tract. None of the expanded alleles 
      contained CAT interruptions. The pathologic expansion in this family was stable 
      during the paternal but not maternal transmission, where it expanded by one 
      trinucleotide and unexpectedly did not lead to anticipation. Our observations 
      suggest that factors other than the length of the CAG repeat play a considerable 
      role in determination of the disease course.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Searching for small tandem/disperse repetitive DNA sequences 
      streamlines many biomedical research processes. For instance, whole genomic array 
      analysis in yeast has revealed 22 PHO-regulated genes. The promoter regions of 
      all but one of them contain at least one of the two core Pho4p binding sites, 
      CACGTG and CACGTT. In humans, microsatellites play a role in a number of rare 
      neurodegenerative diseases such as spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). SCA1 is 
      a hereditary neurodegenerative disease caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the 
      coding sequence of the gene. In bacterial pathogens, microsatellites are proposed 
      to regulate expression of some virulence factors. For example, bacteria commonly 
      generate intra-strain diversity through phase variation which is strongly 
      associated with virulence determinants. A recent analysis of the complete 
      sequences of the Helicobacter pylori strains 26695 and J99 has identified 46 
      putative phase-variable genes among the two genomes through their association 
      with homopolymeric tracts and dinucleotide repeats. Life scientists are 
      increasingly interested in studying the function of small sequences of DNA. 
      However, current search algorithms often generate thousands of matches -- most of 
      which are irrelevant to the researcher. RESULTS: We present our hash function as 
      well as our search algorithm to locate small sequences of DNA within multiple 
      genomes. Our system applies information retrieval algorithms to discover 
      knowledge of cross-species conservation of repeat sequences. We discuss our 
      incorporation of the Gene Ontology (GO) database into these algorithms. We 
      conduct an exhaustive time analysis of our system for various repetitive sequence 
      lengths. For instance, a search for eight bases of sequence within 3.224 GBases 
      on 49 different chromosomes takes 1.147 seconds on average. To illustrate the 
      relevance of the search results, we conduct a search with and without added 
      annotation terms for the yeast Pho4p binding sites, CACGTG and CACGTT. Also, a 
      cross-species search is presented to illustrate how potential hidden correlations 
      in genomic data can be quickly discerned. The findings in one species are used as 
      a catalyst to discover something new in another species. These experiments also 
      demonstrate that our system performs well while searching multiple genomes -- 
      without the main memory constraints present in other systems. CONCLUSION: We 
      present a time-efficient algorithm to locate small segments of DNA and 
      concurrently to search the annotation data accompanying the sequence. Genome-wide 
      searches for short sequences often return hundreds of hits. Our experiments show 
      that subsequently searching the annotation data can refine and focus the results 
      for the user. Our algorithms are also space-efficient in terms of main memory 
      requirements. Source code is available upon request.

TI  - Age at onset variance analysis in spinocerebellar ataxias: a study in a 
      Dutch-French cohort.
PG  - 505-12
AB  - In dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), the issue of whether non-CAG 
      dependent factors contribute to onset age remains unsettled. Data on SCA 
      genotype, onset age, normal/expanded CAG repeat length, sex of the patient and 
      transmitting parent, and family details were available from 802 patients. Based 
      on the model [log(10) (age at onset) = k - b CAG(exp) + epsilon], we examined 
      changes in adjusted R(2) and residual standard error following incorporation of 
      the other factors in this model. The expanded repeat explained 44.3 to 74.9% of 
      onset age variance, although this was less than 50% in SCA3 and SCA6, implicating 
      a large effect of non-CAG factors. The relation between onset age and CAG repeat 
      was similar for SCA1, 3, 6, and 7, but different for SCA2, pointing to different 
      polyglutamine effects in SCA2. For SCA2 and SCA3, 17.1 and 45.5% of onset age 
      variance, respectively, were explained by currently (unidentified) familial 
      factors. We found a significant contribution of the nonexpanded allele in SCA1 
      and SCA6. Besides polyglutamine motif (determined by the expanded CAG repeat 
      length), we identified the following age at onset modifiers: protein context in 
      SCA2; familial factors in SCA2 and SCA3; and the nonexpanded CAG repeat in SCA1 
      and SCA6.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat analysis of spinocerebellar ataxia patients in Oman.
PG  - 61-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the profile of cytosine/adenine/guanine (CAG) repeat 
      expansion in Omani spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) patients. METHODS: Ten SCA 
      patients attending the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital Neurologic clinics, 
      Al-Khoud, Oman in the 3 years starting from January 2000 were recruited for this 
      study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples and CAG repeat 
      expansion analysis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing, 
      when required. RESULTS: The CAG triplet repeats leading to polyglutamine 
      expansion and neurodegeneration are seen in spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 
      and 17. By using primers for SCA 1, 2, 3 and 7, we found the repeats were in the 
      normal range and triplet repeats do not seem to be a common cause for ataxia in 
      Oman. CONCLUSION: Spinocerebellar ataxia in Oman has the normal range of CAG 
      repeats for the commonly found SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA7.

TI  - Comparative genetics of functional trinucleotide tandem repeats in humans and 
      apes.
PG  - 329-39
AB  - Several human neurodegenerative disorders are caused by the expansion of 
      polymorphic trinucleotide repeat regions. Many of these loci are functional short 
      tandem repeats (STRs) located in brain-expressed genes, and their study is thus 
      relevant from both a medical and an evolutionary point of view. The aims of our 
      study are to infer the comparative pattern of variation and evolution of this set 
      of loci in order to show species-specific features in this group of STRs and on 
      their potential for expansion (therefore, an insight into evolutionary medicine) 
      and to unravel whether any human-specific feature may be identified in 
      brain-expressed genes involved in human disease. We analyzed the variability of 
      the normal range of seven expanding STR CAG/CTG loci (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3-MJD, SCA6, 
      SCA8, SCA12, and DRPLA) and two nonexpanding polymorphic CAG loci (KCNN3 and 
      NCOA3) in humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. The study showed a 
      general conservation of the repetitive tract and of the polymorphism in the four 
      species and high heterogeneity among loci distributions. Humans present slightly 
      larger alleles than the rest of species but a more relevant difference appears in 
      variability levels: Humans are the species with the largest variance, although 
      only for the expanding loci, suggesting a relationship between variability levels 
      and expansion potential. The sequence analysis shows high levels of sequence 
      conservation among species, a lack of correspondence between interruption 
      patterns and variability levels, and signs of conservative selective pressure for 
      some of the STR loci. Only two loci (SCA1 and SCA8) show a human specific 
      distribution, with larger alleles than the rest of species. This could account, 
      at the same time, for a human-specific trait and a predisposition to disease 
      through expansion.

TI  - CAG repeats containing CAA interruptions form branched hairpin structures in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 transcripts.
PG  - 3898-910
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), one of the hereditary human 
      neurodegenerative disorders, is caused by the expansion of the CAG tandem repeats 
      in the translated sequence of the SCA2 gene. In a normal population the CAG 
      repeat is polymorphic not only in length but also in the number and localization 
      of its CAA interruptions. The aim of this study was to determine the structure of 
      the repeat region in the normal and mutant SCA2 transcripts and to reveal the 
      structural basis of its normal function and dysfunction. We show here that the 
      properties of the CAA interruptions are major determinants of the CAG repeat 
      folding in the normal SCA2 transcripts. We also show that the uninterrupted 
      repeats in mutant transcripts form slippery hairpins, whose length is further 
      reduced by the base pairing of the repeat portion with a specific flanking 
      sequence. The structural organization of the repeat interruption systems present 
      in other human transcripts, such as SCA1, TBP, FOXP2, and MAML2, are also 
      discussed.

TI  - Patterns of CAG repeat interruptions in SCA1 and SCA2 genes in relation to repeat 
      instability.
PG  - 236-47
AB  - About 3% of the human genome is composed of simple sequence repeats and many of 
      these sequences occur within genes. These repeats are often polymorphic in a 
      normal population and their expansion in specific genes leads to a number of 
      hereditary neurological diseases. Normal variants of disease-related genes 
      contain either pure or interrupted repeats, and the postulated function of the 
      interruptions is to prevent repeat expansions. Their structural role in the 
      repeat tracts of genes and transcripts awaits detailed characterization. In this 
      study, we have determined the SCA1 and SCA2 genotypes in a Polish population and 
      found significant differences in allele spectra and frequencies from those 
      reported for other populations. They are discussed in relation to the repeat 
      expansion mechanism and disease incidence. We postulate that the dynamic mutation 
      of the genes SCA1 (also ATX1 or ataxin 1) and SCA2 (also ATX2 or ataxin 2) may 
      begin from the expansion of long pure repeat tracts without the prior loss of 
      interruptions. A simple way of cost-effective allelotyping of CAG repeat regions 
      in the SCA1 and SCA2genes is also shown. The reliable SSCP/duplex analysis 
      presented here may be the method of choice for the systematic searching of genes 
      for known and novel interrupted repeats.

TI  - Imperfect CAG repeats form diverse structures in SCA1 transcripts.
PG  - 41563-72
AB  - The expanded CAG repeat in the coding sequence of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      1 (SCA1) gene is responsible for SCA1, one of the hereditary human 
      neurodegenerative diseases. In the normal SCA1 alleles usually 1-3 CAT triplets 
      break the continuity of the CAG repeat tracts. Here we show what is the 
      structural role of the CAU interruptions in the SCA1 transcripts. Depending on 
      their number and localization within the repeat tract the interruptions either 
      enlarge the terminal loop of the hairpin formed by the repeats, nucleate the 
      internal loops in its stem structure, or force the repeats to fold into two 
      smaller hairpins. Thus, the interruptions destabilize the CAG repeat hairpin, 
      which is likely to decrease its ability to participate in the putative RNA 
      pathogenesis mechanism driven by the long CAG repeat hairpins.

TI  - No association of the SCA1 (CAG)31 allele with Huntington's disease, myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1 and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.
PG  - 61-3
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansions are the underlying mutation in several 
      neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders including at least eight 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA). The molecular mechanisms of repeat expansion are 
      as yet insufficiently understood. Recently, an association of the SCA1 (CAG)31 
      repeat allele with Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy type 1 was 
      described. These findings implicate a possible role of the SCA1 (CAG)31 allele in 
      other triplet diseases. We analyzed the SCA1 CAG repeat length in a large sample 
      of Huntington's disease (n=182), myotonic dystrophy type 1 (n=64) and SCA3 (n=31) 
      patients. In none of these groups was a significant association with the 31 
      repeat allele found. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that this allele 
      is involved in the etiology of trinucleotide expansion.

TI  - Molecular genetics of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia: mutation analysis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia genes and CAG/CTG repeat expansion detection in 225 
      Italian families.
PG  - 727-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, at present 
      associated with 22 loci (spinocerebellar ataxia [SCA] 1-SCA8, SCA10-SCA19, SCA21, 
      SCA22, fibroblast growth factor 14 [FGF14]-SCA, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy [DRPLA]). The relevant gene has been identified in 12 cases (SCA1-3, 
      SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, FGF14, and DRPLA), and in all but the recently identified 
      SCA14, SCA17, PRKCG and FGF14 genes, the defect consists of the expansion of a 
      short nucleotide repeat. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relative prevalence of 
      SCA1-3, SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, and SCA17 gene expansions in Italian families with 
      hereditary ataxia, specifically to verify the occurrence of SCA10, SCA12, and 
      SCA17 in Italy; and to analyze samples from probands with negative test results 
      at the initial screening by means of the repeat expansion detection technique to 
      identify CAG/CTG expansions in novel loci.Patients Two hundred twenty-five 
      unrelated Italian index cases with hereditary ataxia, most (n = 183) of whom 
      presented with a clear dominantly transmitted trait. RESULTS: We found that SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene mutations accounted for most cases (21% and 24%, respectively). We 
      found SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, and SCA17 to be very rare (approximately 1% each), 
      and no case of SCA10 or SCA12 was identified. Half of the index cases (113/225) 
      were negative for expansions in the known SCA genes. Repeat expansion detection 
      analysis performed on 111 of these cases showed a CAG/CTG repeat expansion of at 
      least 50 triplets in 22 (20%). Twenty-one of 22 expansions could be attributed to 
      length variation at 2 polymorphic loci (expanded repeat domain CAG/CTG 1 [ERDA1] 
      or CTG repeat on chromosome 18q21.1 [CTG18.1]). In 1 patient, the expansion was 
      assigned to the DRPLA gene. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of SCA1-3 and SCA6-7 
      gene mutations is peculiar in Italy. We found a relatively high frequency of SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene expansions; SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 mutations were rare, compared with 
      other European countries. No SCA10 or SCA12 and only a few SCA8 (2/225) and SCA17 
      (2/225) families were detected. In patients negative for defects in known SCA 
      genes, repeat expansion detection data strongly suggest that, at least in our 
      population, CAG/CTG expansions in novel genes should be considered an unlikely 
      cause of the SCA phenotype.

TI  - Analysis of trinucleotide repeats in different SCA loci in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      patients and in normal population of Taiwan.
PG  - 355-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) patients referred to our research 
      center, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD (Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, SCA8 and SCA12 
      loci were assessed for expansion of trinucleotide repeats. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      A total of 211 ADCA patients, including 202 patients with dominantly inherited 
      ataxia from 81 Taiwanese families and nine patients with sporadic ataxia, were 
      included in this study and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. 
      The amplified products of all loci were analyzed on both 3% agarose gels and 6% 
      denaturing urea-polyacrylamide gels. PCR-based Southern blots were also applied 
      for the detection of SCA7 locus. RESULTS: The SCA1 mutation was detected in six 
      affected individuals from one family (1.2%) with expanded alleles of 50-53 CAG 
      repeats. Fourteen individuals from nine families (11%) had a CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while affected SCA2 alleles have 34-49 CAG 
      repeats. The SCA3/MJD CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in 60 affected 
      individuals from 26 families (32%) was expanded to 71-85 CAG repeats. As for the 
      SCA7 locus, there were two affected individuals from one family (1.2%) possessed 
      41 and 100 CAG repeats, respectively. However, we did not detect expansion in the 
      SCA6, SCA8 and SCA12 loci in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The SCA3/MJD CAG expansion 
      was the most frequent mutation among the SCA patients. The relative prevalence of 
      SCA3/MJD in Taiwan was higher than that of SCA2, SCA1 and SCA7.

TI  - Possible reduced penetrance of expansion of 44 to 47 CAG/CAA repeats in the 
      TATA-binding protein gene in spinocerebellar ataxia type 17.
PG  - 209-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is an autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia caused by expansion of CAG/CAA trinucleotide repeats in the 
      TATA-binding protein (TBP) gene. Because the number of triplets in patients with 
      SCA17 in previous studies ranged from 43 to 63, the normal number of 
      trinucleotide units has been considered to be 42 or less. However, some healthy 
      subjects in SCA17 pedigrees carry alleles with the same number of expanded 
      repeats as patients with SCA17. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the minimum number of 
      CAG/CAA repeats in the TBP gene that causes SCA17. DESIGN: We amplified the 
      region of the TBP gene containing the CAG/CAA repeat by means of polymerase chain 
      reaction and performed fragment and sequence analyses. PATIENTS: The subjects 
      included 734 patients with SCA (480 patients with sporadic SCA and 254 patients 
      with familial SCA) without CAG repeat expansions at the SCA1, SCA2, 
      Machado-Joseph disease, SCA6, SCA7, or dentatorubral-pallidolluysian atrophy 
      loci, with 162 healthy subjects, 216 patients with Parkinson disease, and 195 
      with Alzheimer disease as control subjects. RESULTS: Eight patients with SCA 
      possessed an allele with more than 43 CAG/CAA repeats. Among the non-SCA groups, 
      alleles with 43 to 45 repeats were seen in 3 healthy subjects and 2 with 
      Parkinson disease. In 1 SCA pedigree, a patient with possible SCA17 and her 
      healthy sister had alleles with 45 repeats. A 34-year-old man carrying alleles 
      with 47 and 44 repeats (47/44) had developed progressive cerebellar ataxia and 
      myoclonus at 25 years of age, and he exhibited dementia and pyramidal signs. He 
      was the only affected person in his pedigree, although his father and mother 
      carried alleles with mildly expanded repeats (44/36 and 47/36, respectively). In 
      another pedigree, 1 patient carried a 43-repeat allele, whereas another patient 
      had 2 normal alleles, indicating that the 43-repeat allele may not be pathologic 
      in this family. CONCLUSIONS: We estimate that 44 CAG/CAA repeats is the minimum 
      number required to cause SCA17. However, the existence of unaffected subjects 
      with mildly expanded triplets suggests that the TBP gene mutation may not 
      penetrate fully. Homozygosity of alleles with mildly expanded triplet repeats in 
      the TBP gene might contribute to the pathologic phenotype.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia: SCA2 is the most frequent mutation in 
      eastern India.
PG  - 448-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) has been reported as the 
      commonest dominant hereditary ataxia in India. However, India is an ethnically 
      and religiously diverse population. Previous studies have not clearly indicated 
      exact ethnic and religious origins, and must therefore be interpreted with 
      caution. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of different 
      SCA mutations in a relatively homogeneous population from eastern India. METHODS: 
      We identified 28 families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia from eastern 
      India. Each underwent full clinical evaluation and were analysed for the presence 
      of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, and SCA17 mutations. In addition, 
      haplotype analysis was carried out in seven of the 16 families with SCA2. 
      RESULTS: Seven patients from four (14%) families were positive for an expansion 
      in SCA1 and 26 patients from 16 (57%) families were positive for an expansion in 
      SCA2. No mutations were detected in the remaining eight families (29%). Most of 
      the SCA1 and SCA2 families were Hindu from the state of Bihar. Five out of 26 
      SCA2 patients in this study did not have slow saccades. In addition, four of 
      seven SCA1 patients had slow saccades. We found an association between the SCA2 
      CAG repeat expansion and the 285 base pair (bp) allele of microsatellite marker 
      D12S1672, and also data supportive of the association between the expansion and 
      the 225 bp allele of D12S1333, which has been previously described. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We conclude that (1) although slow ocular saccades are highly suggestive of SCA2, 
      that they are not universal, nor are they exclusive to this disorder and (2) SCA2 
      is likely to be the commonest dominant ataxia in eastern India, with further 
      evidence for a founder effect.

TI  - Genetic testing in spinocerebellar ataxia in Taiwan: expansions of trinucleotide 
      repeats in SCA8 and SCA17 are associated with typical Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 209-14
AB  - DNA tests in normal subjects and patients with ataxia and Parkinson's disease 
      (PD) were carried out to assess the frequency of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) and 
      to document the distribution of SCA mutations underlying ethnic Chinese in 
      Taiwan. MJD/SCA3 (46%) was the most common autosomal dominant SCA in the 
      Taiwanese cohort, followed by SCA6 (18%) and SCA1 (3%). No expansions of SCA 
      types 2, 10, 12, or dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) were detected. The 
      clinical phenotypes of these affected SCA patients were very heterogeneous. All 
      of them showed clinical symptoms of cerebellar ataxia, with or without other 
      associated features. The frequencies of large normal alleles are closely 
      associated with the prevalence of SCA1, SCA2, MJD/SCA3, SCA6, and DRPLA among 
      Taiwanese, Japanese, and Caucasians. Interestingly, abnormal expansions of SCA8 
      and SCA17 genes were detected in patients with PD. The clinical presentation for 
      these patients is typical of idiopathic PD with the following characteristics: 
      late onset of disease, resting tremor in the limbs, rigidity, bradykinesia, and a 
      good response to levodopa. This study appears to be the first report describing 
      the PD phenotype in association with an expanded allele in the TATA-binding 
      protein gene and suggests that SCA8 may also be a cause of typical PD.

TI  - Slipped (CTG).(CAG) repeats of the myotonic dystrophy locus: surface probing with 
      anti-DNA antibodies.
PG  - 585-600
AB  - At least 15 human diseases have been associated with the length-dependent 
      expansion of gene-specific (CTG).(CAG) repeats, including myotonic dystrophy 
      (DM1) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). Repeat expansion is likely to 
      involve unusual DNA structures. We have structurally characterized such DNA, with 
      (CTG)(n).(CAG)(n) repeats of varying length (n=17-79), by high-resolution gel 
      electrophoresis, and have probed their surfaces with anti-DNA antibodies of known 
      specificities. We prepared homoduplex S-DNAs, which are (CTG)x.(CAG)y where x=y, 
      and heteroduplex SI-DNAs, which are hybrids where x>y or x<y. S-DNAs formed many 
      different species of slipped isomers, as indicated by its multiple 
      electrophoretic species. In contrast, SI-DNAs formed distinct structures, as 
      indicated by the limited electrophoretic species for all possible repeat length 
      pairings. Sister SI-DNAs with an excess of CAG repeats always migrated slower 
      than their sister SI-DNAs with an excess of CTG repeats. Strikingly, both the 
      propensity to form slipped structures and the pattern of S-DNAs, but not SI-DNAs, 
      varied for similar lengths of CTG/CAG repeats between the DM1 and SCA1 loci, 
      highlighting a role for flanking cis-elements in S-DNA but not SI-DNA formation. 
      Slipped structures bound structure and nucleotide-specific anti-DNA antibodies. 
      Binding of anti-B-DNA antibodies was reduced for both S-DNAs and SI-DNAs relative 
      to their linear forms. SI-DNAs bound anti-Z-DNA antibodies, while both S and 
      SI-DNAs bound anti-cruciform antibodies, revealing shared characteristics between 
      the corresponding DNA structures and slipped DNAs. Such features of the repeats 
      may be recognized by cellular proteins known to bind such structures.

TI  - Frequency analysis and clinical characterization of spinocerebellar ataxia types 
      1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 in Korean patients.
PG  - 858-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: By genetic analysis, the CAG repeat expansion has been established in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. Despite the genetic 
      differentiation of SCA, the characterization of the phenotypes of various SCAs 
      has been challenging for better clinical diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the 
      frequencies and the clinical manifestations of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 
      in Korean patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed genetic analysis in 253 
      unrelated Korean patients with progressive cerebellar ataxia. We compared the 
      frequencies, inheritance patterns, and various clinical manifestations of 
      patients with genetically confirmed SCA. RESULTS: Among the 52 patients with 
      expanded CAG repeat, the most frequent SCA type was SCA2, followed by SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA1, and SCA7. Nine patients (17%) had a negative family history of ataxia, 
      mostly in SCA6. There were characteristic clinical features such as hypotonia and 
      optic atrophy for SCA1; hyporeflexia for SCA2; nystagmus, bulging eye, and 
      dystonia for SCA3; and macular degeneration for SCA7. Interestingly, 4 patients 
      (1 with SCA2, 1 with SCA3, and 2 with SCA6) were misdiagnosed as having 
      multiple-system atrophy because of the absence of family history and the presence 
      of parkinsonism and urinary incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a 
      detailed analysis of the clinical characteristics of the genetically defined 
      CAG-repeat SCAs in Korean patients. Although phenotypes were heterogeneous, some 
      clinical features may be helpful for clinical diagnosis. However, genetic studies 
      for SCA are needed despite uncertain family history or the presence of atypical 
      clinical features causing misdiagnosis as atypical parkinsonism.

TI  - A novel autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA22) linked to chromosome 
      1p21-q23.
PG  - 1293-9
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically, pathologically 
      and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. Ten responsible genes have been 
      identified for spinocerebellar ataxia types SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, 
      SCA10, SCA12 and SCA17, and dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      mutation is caused by an expansion of a CAG, CTG or ATTCT repeat sequence of 
      these genes. Six additional loci, SCA4, SCA5, SCA11, SCA13, SCA14 and SCA16 have 
      also been mapped. The growing heterogeneity of the autosomal dominant forms of 
      these diseases shows that the genetic aetiologies of at least 20% of ADCA have 
      yet to be elucidated. We ascertained and clinically characterized a 
      four-generation Chinese pedigree segregating an autosomal dominant phenotype for 
      cerebellar ataxia. Direct mutation analysis, linkage analysis for all known SCA 
      loci and a genome-wide linkage study were performed. Direct mutation analysis 
      excluded SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17 and DRPLA, and genetic linkage analysis 
      excluded SCA4, 5, 11, 13, 14 and 16. The genome-wide linkage study suggested 
      linkage to a locus on chromosome 1p21-q23, with the highest two-point LOD score 
      at D1S1167 (Zmax = 3.46 at theta = 0.00). Multipoint analysis and haplotype 
      reconstruction traced this novel SCA locus (SCA22) to a 43.7-cM interval flanked 
      by D1S206 and D1S2878 (Zmax = 3.78 under four liability classes, and 2.67 using 
      affected-only method). The age at onset ranged from 10 to 46 years. All affected 
      members had gait ataxia with variable features of dysarthria and hyporeflexia. 
      Head MRI showed homogeneous atrophy of the cerebellum without involvement of the 
      brainstem. In six parent-child pairs, median onset occurred 10 years earlier in 
      offspring than in their parents, suggesting anticipation. This family is distinct 
      from other families with SCA and is characterized by a slowly progressive, pure 
      cerebellar ataxia.

TI  - Interaction of Akt-phosphorylated ataxin-1 with 14-3-3 mediates neurodegeneration 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.
PG  - 457-68
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is one of several neurological disorders 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion. In SCA1, this expansion produces an abnormally 
      long polyglutamine tract in the protein ataxin-1. Mutant polyglutamine proteins 
      accumulate in neurons, inducing neurodegeneration, but the mechanism underlying 
      this accumulation has been unclear. We have discovered that the 14-3-3 protein, a 
      multifunctional regulatory molecule, mediates the neurotoxicity of ataxin-1 by 
      binding to and stabilizing ataxin-1, thereby slowing its normal degradation. The 
      association of ataxin-1 with 14-3-3 is regulated by Akt phosphorylation, and in a 
      Drosophila model of SCA1, both 14-3-3 and Akt modulate neurodegeneration. Our 
      finding that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling and 14-3-3 cooperate to 
      modulate the neurotoxicity of ataxin-1 provides insight into SCA1 pathogenesis 
      and identifies potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

      SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and DRPLA cases were immunostained with anti-ubiquitin or 
      anti-expanded polyglutamine antibody (1C2) and were screened for the presence of 
      neuronal intranuclear inclusions. Although the degree of cerebellar degeneration 
      varied greatly, cerebellar Purkinje cells were uniformly characterised by the 
      absence of neuronal intranuclear inclusion. Complete absence of neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusion in Purkinje cells is apparently paradoxical and hardly 
      explained if neuronal intranuclear inclusion formation is positively correlated 
      to a mechanism accelerating neuronal death. It may, otherwise, suggest an 
      intrinsic link between neuronal intranuclear inclusion formation and 
      neurodegeneration in opposite directions in human Purkinje cells, more or less 
      affected in these CAG repeat disorders.

TI  - Analysis of SCA8 and SCA12 loci in 134 Italian ataxic patients negative for 
      SCA1-3, 6 and 7 CAG expansions.
PG  - 923-9
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders, six of which are caused by expansion of a polyglutamine-coding CAG 
      repeats ( SCA1- 3, 6, 7 and 17). In addition, expansions of a CAG triplet in the 
      5' region of a gene and a CTG triplet in an antisense RNA have been demonstrated 
      in the SCA12 and SCA8 genes respectively. Our series of 134 ataxic patients (22 
      familial and 112 sporadic, tested negative for SCAI-3, 6, 7) was investigated for 
      the presence of triplet expansions in the SCA8 and SCA12 genes. No SCA12 
      expansion was identified. A moderate SCA8 expansion (85-97 repeats) was found in 
      two unrelated families with slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia. The frequency 
      of SCA8 expansion accounts for approximately 4.3 % of the whole pool of our 
      ataxia families (2 out of 46), while none of the 127 controls screened carried > 
      35 CTG+CTA repeats. Our data suggest a possible pathogenetic role of this 
      mutation, which at present is still controversial, and confirm the rarity of the 
      SCA12 expansion in Italian patients.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1): phenotype-genotype correlation studies in 
      intermediate alleles.
PG  - 204-9
AB  - CAG repeat expansions with loss of CAT interruptions in the coding region of the 
      ataxin-1 gene are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). For 
      molecular genetic diagnosis it is necessary to define the limits of normal and 
      pathological size ranges. In most studies, normal alleles as measured by PCR 
      range from 6-39 units with interruptions of 1-3 CAT trinucleotides that are 
      thought to be involved in the stability of the trinucleotide stretch during DNA 
      replication. Expanded alleles have been reported to carry 39-81 CAG 
      trinucleotides without stabilising CAT interruptions. To evaluate the limits 
      between normal and disease size ranges we analysed the repeat length and 
      composition of the SCA1 gene in 15 individuals with alleles ranging from 36 and 
      41 triplets for genotype-phenotype correlation studies. We found the 39 
      trinucleotide-allele to be either interrupted by CAT repeats or formed by a pure 
      CAG stretch. The clinical features of individuals carrying 39 uninterrupted CAG 
      repeats did not differ from the SCA1 phenotype in general with dysphagia, pale 
      discs, pyramidal signs and cerebellar tremor being more frequent as compared to 
      other SCA genotypes. In contrast, the interrupted 39 trinucleotide-allele is not 
      correlated with the SCA1 phenotype.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias in the Netherlands: prevalence and age at onset variance 
      analysis.
PG  - 702-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: International prevalence estimates of autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxias (ADCA) vary from 0.3 to 2.0 per 100,000. The prevalence of ADCA in the 
      Netherlands is unknown. Fifteen genetic loci have been identified (SCA-1-8, 
      SCA-10-14, SCA-16, and SCA-17) and nine of the corresponding genes have been 
      cloned. In SCA-1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA-12 and SCA-17 the mutation has been 
      shown to be an expanded CAG repeat. Previously, the length of the CAG repeat was 
      found to account for 50 to 80% of variance in age at onset. Because of 
      heterogeneity in encoded proteins, different pathophysiologic mechanisms leading 
      to neurodegeneration could be involved. The relationship between CAG repeat 
      length and age at onset would then differ accordingly. METHOD: Based on the 
      results of SCA mutation analysis in the three DNA diagnostic laboratories that 
      serve the entire Dutch population, the authors surveyed the number of families 
      and affected individuals per SCA gene, as well as individual repeat length and 
      age at onset. Regression analysis was applied to study the relationship between 
      CAG repeat length and age at onset per SCA gene. The slopes of the different 
      regression curves were compared. RESULTS: On November 1, 2000, mutations were 
      found in 145 ADCA families and 391 affected individuals were identified. The 
      authors extrapolated a minimal prevalence of 3.0 per 100,000 (range 2.8 to 
      3.8/100,000). SCA3 was the most frequent mutation. CAG repeat length contributed 
      to 52 to 76% of age at onset variance. Regression curve slopes for SCA-1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, and SCA7 did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated minimal 
      prevalence of ADCA in the Netherlands is 3.0 per 100,000 inhabitants. Except for 
      SCA6, the relationship between age at onset and CAG repeat expansion does not 
      differ significantly between SCA-1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA7 patient groups in our 
      population, indicating that these SCA subtypes share similar mechanisms of 
      polyglutamine-induced neurotoxicity, despite heterogeneity in gene products.

TI  - Spastic paraplegia, ataxia, mental retardation (SPAR): a novel genetic disorder.
PG  - 411-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a kindred with a dominantly inherited neurologic disorder 
      manifested either as uncomplicated spastic paraplegia or ataxia, spastic 
      paraplegia, and mental retardation. METHODS: Neurologic examinations and 
      molecular genetic analysis (exclusion of known SCA and HSP genes and loci; and 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion detection [RED]) were performed in six affected 
      and four unaffected subjects in this family. MRI, electromyography (EMG), and 
      nerve conduction studies were performed in three affected subjects. RESULTS: The 
      phenotype of this dominantly inherited syndrome varied in succeeding generations. 
      Pure spastic paraplegia was present in the earliest generation; subsequent 
      generations had ataxia and mental retardation. MRI showed marked atrophy of the 
      spinal cord in all patients and cerebellar atrophy in those with ataxia. 
      Laboratory analysis showed that the disorder was not caused by mutations in genes 
      that cause SCA-1, SCA-2, SCA-3, SCA-6, SCA-7, SCA-8, and SCA-12; not linked to 
      other known loci for autosomal dominant ataxia (SCA-4, SCA-5, SCA-10, SCA-11, 
      SCA-13, SCA-14, and SCA-16); and not linked to known loci for autosomal dominant 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (SPG-3, SPG-4, SPG-6, SPG-8, SPG-9, SPG-10, 
      SPG-12, and SPG-13) or autosomal recessive HSP SPG-7. Analysis of 
      intergenerational differences in age at onset of symptoms suggests genetic 
      anticipation. Using RED, the authors did not detect expanded CAG, CCT, TGG, or 
      CGT repeats that segregate with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The authors describe an 
      unusual, dominantly inherited neurologic disorder in which the phenotype (pure 
      spastic paraplegia or spastic ataxia with variable mental retardation) differed 
      in subsequent generations. The molecular explanation for apparent genetic 
      anticipation does not appear to involve trinucleotide repeat expansion.

TI  - Is the 31 CAG repeat allele of the spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) gene locus 
      non-specifically associated with trinucleotide expansion diseases?
PG  - 201-5
AB  - A number of human hereditary neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders are 
      caused by the expansion of trinucleotide repeats within certain genes. The 
      molecular mechanisms that underlie these expansions are not yet known. We have 
      analyzed six trinucleotide repeat-containing loci [spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, 
      SCA3, SCA8), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), Huntington chorea (HD) 
      and fragile X syndrome (FRAXA)] in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients (n = 
      52). As controls, we analyzed two groups of subjects: healthy control subjects (n 
      =133), and a group of patients with non-triplet neuromuscular diseases (n = 68) 
      caused by point mutations, deletions or duplications (spinal muscular atrophy, 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 1A, hereditary neuropathy with liability to 
      pressure palsies, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy). Allele frequency 
      distributions for all tested loci were similar in these three groups with the 
      exception of the SCA1 locus. In DM1 patients, the SCA1 allele with 31 CAG repeats 
      account for 40.4% of all chromosomes tested, which is significantly higher than 
      in two other groups (11.3% in healthy controls and 6.6% in the group of 
      non-triplet diseased patients; P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). This is 
      consistent with our previous findings in HD patients. The absence of this 
      association in non-triplet diseases as well as in healthy controls could indicate 
      a possible role of this SCA1 allele with 31 repeats in triplet diseases. Here we 
      discuss a possible role of the SCA1 region in pathological trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions.

TI  - Molecular analysis of Spinocerebellar ataxias in Koreans: frequencies and 
      reference ranges of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7.
PG  - 336-41
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. CAG repeat expansions in the causative genes have been identified as 
      the basic cause of several types of SCAs, and have been used for the diagnoses 
      and classifications of patients with ataxia. In order to assess the frequency and 
      CAG repeat size ranges of SCAs, and to establish an effective strategy for 
      molecular diagnosis, we performed a molecular analysis of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      and SCA7 in 76 patients. These patients were as follows: 32 with dominant 
      inheritance, 39 sporadic cases, and 5 with unknown family histories. The normal 
      and affected CAG repeat size ranges were established at five SCA loci in Koreans, 
      which was consistent with previous reports. The total prevalence of the five 
      types of SCAs was 39.5% in the 76 patients with ataxia, regardless of their 
      family history. It was 75.0% in the 32 families with a dominant inheritance. The 
      most frequent type was SCA3 (15.8%), followed by SCA2 (14.5%). Both types 
      combined formed 76.7% of the 30 patients with CAG expansions. SCA1, SCA6, and 
      SCA7 were less frequent, affecting 3.9%, 2.6%, and 2.6% of the cases, 
      respectively. This mutation spectrum is quite different from a previous report 
      concerning Koreans, but is similar to the distributions that are seen in several 
      ethnic populations worldwide. For a correct and effective diagnosis of SCAs, we 
      suggest that a molecular diagnosis be undertaken, even in patients without a 
      family history, as well as those with a family history. A stepwise approach is 
      also recommended. Patients with ataxia should be tested for SCA2 and SCA3. 
      Individuals testing negative should be tested for SCA1, SCA6, and SCA7.

TI  - Ophthalmological findings in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 are not 
      correlated with neurological anticipation.
PG  - 722-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Optic atrophy, attenuation of the oscillatory potentials (OPs) of the 
      electroretinogram (ERG), and enlargement of corneal endothelial cells, have been 
      reported in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). These patients 
      have a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the SCA1 gene and show neurological 
      anticipation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the 
      ophthalmological findings are correlated with the neurological disorders, and 
      whether ophthalmological anticipation is present in patients with SCA1. METHODS: 
      The visual acuity, ERGs, and corneal endothelial cell density were examined in 14 
      patients whose DNA analysis revealed an expanded trinucleotide repeat in an 
      allele of the SCA1 gene. The results of the tests were compared with the 
      trinucleotide repeat number and the duration of the neuronal disease. RESULTS: 
      The neurological disorders in the patients showed anticipation. The negative 
      correlation between the trinucleotide repeat number and the neurological disorder 
      was statistically significant (P<0.0001). However, the correlations between 
      trinucleotide repeat number and visual acuity, amplitude of OPs, and corneal 
      endothelial cell density were not significant. Statistically significant 
      correlations were found between the duration of the neuronal disease and the 
      visual acuity, OPs, and corneal endothelial cell density (P<0.0001, P=0.0004, and 
      P<0.0001, respectively). The ophthalmological disorders were prominent in 
      patients who had neuronal disease for more than 10 years. CONCLUSION: Unlike the 
      neurological findings, the ophthalmological disorders in patients with SCA1 were 
      not correlated with the trinucleotide repeat number of the SCA1 gene. The 
      ophthalmological findings were most highly correlated with the duration of the 
      neuronal disease.

TI  - Frequency analysis of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias in Taiwanese patients 
      and clinical and molecular characterization of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 1105-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders. The mutational basis for most of these disorders is 
      an expanded CAG repeat sequence within the coding regions of the genes involved. 
      The prevalence of SCA in the ethnic Chinese on Taiwan remains unclear. Moreover, 
      there has been no report of SCA type 6 (SCA6) among Chinese people. OBJECTIVES: 
      To characterize the prevalence of SCA in the ethnic Chinese on Taiwan, and to 
      specifically characterize Chinese patients with SCA6 in terms of clinical and 
      molecular features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a molecular approach, we 
      investigated SCA in 74 Taiwanese families with dominantly inherited ataxias and 
      in 49 Taiwanese patients with sporadic ataxias. Clinical and molecular features 
      of SCA6 were further characterized in 12 patients from 8 families and in 2 
      sporadic cases. Furthermore, the intragenic polymorphic marker D19S1150 was 
      amplified by polymerase chain reaction to analyze for linkage disequilibrium. 
      RESULTS: Machado-Joseph disease-SCA3 was the most common type of autosomal 
      dominant SCA in the Taiwanese cohort, accounting for 35 cases (47.3%), followed 
      by SCA6 (8 [10.8%]), SCA2 (8 [10.8%]), SCA1 (4 [5.4%]), SCA7 (2 [2.7%]), 
      dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (1 [1.4%]), and SCA8 (0%). The genes 
      responsible for 16 (21.6%) of Taiwanese dominantly inherited SCA cases remain to 
      be determined. Among the 49 patients with sporadic ataxias in the present series, 
      2 (4.1%) were found to harbor SCA6 mutations. In the families with SCA6, we found 
      significant anticipation in the absence of genetic instability on transmission, 
      indicating that some other mechanism might account for the anticipation. The same 
      frequent allele of the intragenic DNA marker (D19S1150) was shared by 7 of 10 
      Taiwanese families with SCA6. CONCLUSIONS: Although SCA6 has, so far, not been 
      reported in mainland Chinese, we found a geographic cluster of families with SCA6 
      on Taiwan. Genotyping studies suggest a founder effect in the Taiwanese patients 
      with SCA6.

PG  - 43-8
AB  - Fourteen patients with spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) and 11 controls with 
      similar mean age and IQ estimates were submitted to a neuropsychological test 
      battery comprising tests for IQ, attention, verbal and visuospatial memory as 
      well as executive functions. Neuropsychological assessment yielded verbal memory 
      and executive dysfunction while tests of visuospatial memory and attention were 
      not significantly impaired in SCA1 as compared to controls. Test performance was 
      neither related to the repeat length, the age of onset nor the disease duration. 
      The profile of cognitive impairment in SCA1 with prominent executive dysfunction 
      corresponds to the concept of "frontal-subcortical" dementia that is likely to be 
      contingent upon disruption of a cerebrocerebellar circuitry that consists of 
      afferent and efferent connections between the prefrontal cortex and the 
      cerebellum.

PG  - 311-4
AB  - To identify the prevalence and determinants of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) we studied 58 patients with a molecular diagnosis of 
      SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3. Data on the symptoms of RLS were collected by a standardized 
      questionnaire, and RLS was diagnosed when patients met the four minimal criteria 
      of the syndrome as recently defined by an international study group. In addition, 
      we studied the relationship between RLS and age, age at ataxia onset, CAG repeat 
      length, and nerve conduction and evoked potentials data. RLS was significantly 
      more frequent in SCA patients than in controls (28% vs. 10%). Age at RLS onset in 
      SCA was 49.0 +/- 10.9 years. There were no significant differences in nerve 
      conduction or evoked potentials between RLS and non-RLS SCA patients. The 
      probability of developing RLS increased with age but not with CAG repeat length 
      or higher age of ataxia onset. The data provide evidence that patients with SCA1, 
      SCA2 and SCA3 are per se more susceptible to RLS than non-affected individuals. 
      The probability of developing RLS is related principally to the period over which 
      the CAG repeat mutation exerts its effect and not to CAG repeat length or age of 
      ataxia onset.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 in China: molecular analysis and genotype-phenotype 
      correlation in 5 families.
PG  - 789-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Twelve genetic types of autosomal dominant hereditary ataxia have 
      been recently identified and the genes responsible for most of them cloned. 
      Molecular identification of the type of ataxia is important to determine the 
      disease prevalence and its natural history in various populations. OBJECTIVES: To 
      perform molecular analysis of 75 Chinese families affected with spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) and to evaluate the spectrum of mutations in these genes and the 
      correlation between genotypes and phenotypes in Chinese patients. SETTING: 
      Neurogenetics Unit, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China. METHODS: One 
      hundred nine patients from 75 kindreds diagnosed as having autosomal dominant 
      SCA, 16 patients with sporadic SCA or spastic paraplegia, 280 control chromosomes 
      of the Chinese population, and 120 control chromosomes of the Sakha population 
      were selected for this study. We conducted detailed mutational analysis by direct 
      sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products amplified from genomic DNA. 
      RESULTS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) was identified in 5 families with 
      12 studied patients. All affected family members were heterozygous for a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the SCA1 gene containing 51 to 64 trinucleotide repeats. 
      Normal alleles had 26 to 35 repeats. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 accounted for 
      7% of the studied Chinese families with ataxia. In addition, we determined the 
      frequency of a single vs double CAT interruption in 120 control chromosomes of 
      the Siberian Sakha population, which has the highest known prevalence of SCA1, 
      and compared this with 280 control chromosomes from the Chinese populations. The 
      results show that 64.7% of the Siberian normal alleles contain a single CAT 
      interruption, whereas 92% of the Chinese had more than 1 interruption. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 is responsible for 7% of affected 
      families in the Chinese population. A correlation between the prevalence of SCA1 
      and the number of CAT interruptions in the trinucleotide chain suggests that a 
      CAT-to-CAG substitution may have been the initial event contributing to the 
      generation of expanded alleles and influencing relative prevalence of SCA1.

      heterogeneous group of disorders. The mutations for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, and SCA-12 are identified and caused by an expansion of a CAG or a CTG 
      repeat sequence of these genes. Six additional loci for SCA4, SCA5, SCA-10, 
      SCA-11, SCA-13, and SCA-14 are mapped. The growing heterogeneity of the autosomal 
      dominant forms of these diseases shows that the genetic etiologies of at least 
      20% of ADCA have yet to be elucidated. METHODS: The authors ascertained and 
      clinically characterized a four-generation pedigree segregating an autosomal 
      dominant phenotype for SCA. Direct mutation analysis, repeat expansion detection 
      analysis, and linkage analysis for all known SCA loci were performed. RESULTS: 
      Direct mutational analysis excluded SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 12; genetic linkage 
      analysis excluded SCA4, 5,10, 11, 13, and 14, giving significant negative lod 
      scores. Examination of the family showed that all affected members had gait 
      ataxia and akinesia with variable features of dysarthria, hyporeflexia, and mild 
      intellectual impairment. Eye movements were normal. Head MRI showed atrophy of 
      the cerebellum without involvement of the brainstem. In 10 parent-child pairs, 
      median onset occurred 10.5 years earlier in offspring than in their parents, 
      suggesting anticipation. CONCLUSION: This family is distinct from other families 
      with SCA and is characterized by cerebellar ataxia and extrapyramidal signs.

PG  - 91-6
AB  - Expanded CAG trinucleotide repeats are known to be responsible for five of the 
      autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7). We 
      have typed each of these repeats in 226 multiple sclerosis sibling pair families. 
      No expanded repeats were seen, indicating an absence of SCA phenocopies in 
      clinically defined familial multiple sclerosis. However, transmission 
      disequilibrium testing for these repeats demonstrated significant excess 
      transmission of the 22 repeat length allele of the SCA2 gene (P=4. 4E-06) in 
      multiple sclerosis patients. This observation is consistent with pleiotropic 
      effects of the SCA2 gene, with a non-dynamic mutation/polymorphism contributing 
      epistatically to susceptibility in multiple sclerosis.

TI  - Genetic background of apparently idiopathic sporadic cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 132-7
AB  - Disease-causing mutations have been identified in various entities of autosomal 
      dominant ataxia and in Friedreich's ataxia. However, no molecular pathogenic 
      factor is known to cause idiopathic cerebellar ataxias. We investigated the 
      CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats causing spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 
      8 and 12, and the GAA repeat of the frataxin gene in 124 patients apparently 
      suffering from idiopathic sporadic ataxia, including 20 patients with the 
      clinical diagnosis of multiple system atrophy. Patients with a positive family 
      history, a typical Friedreich phenotype, or symptomatic ataxia were excluded. 
      Genetic analyses uncovered the most common Friedreich mutation in 10 patients 
      with an age at onset between 13 and 36 years. The SCA6 mutation was present in 
      nine patients with disease onset between 47 and 68 years of age. The CTG repeat 
      associated with SCA8 was expanded in three patients. One patient had SCA2 
      attributable to a de novo mutation from a paternally transmitted, intermediate 
      allele. We did not identify the SCA1, SCA3, SCA7 or SCA12 mutation in idiopathic 
      sporadic ataxia patients. No trinucleotide repeat expansion was detected in the 
      MSA subgroup. This study has revealed the genetic basis in 19% of apparently 
      idiopathic ataxia patients. SCA6 is the most frequent mutation in late onset 
      cerebellar ataxia. The frataxin trinucleotide expansion should be investigated in 
      all sporadic ataxia patients with onset before age 40, even when the phenotype is 
      atypical for Friedreich's ataxia.

TI  - Analysis of CAG repeats in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia patients and distribution of CAG repeats at the SCA1, SCA2 
      and SCA6 loci in nine ethnic populations of eastern India.
PG  - 597-604
AB  - To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 57 unrelated 
      individuals clinically diagnosed as ataxia patients we analysed the SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci for expansion of CAG repeats. We detected CAG 
      repeat expansion in 6 patients (10.5%) at the SCA1 locus. Ten of the 57 patients 
      (17.5%) had CAG repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while four had CAG expansion 
      at the SCA3/MJD locus (7%). At the SCA6 locus there was a single patient (1.8%) 
      with 21 CAG repeats. We have not detected any patient with expansion in the SCA7 
      and DRPLA loci. To test whether the frequencies of the large normal alleles in 
      SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6 loci can reflect some light on prevalence of the subtypes of 
      SCAs we studied the CAG repeat variation in these loci in nine ethnic 
      sub-populations of eastern India from which the patients originated. We report 
      here that the frequency of large normal alleles (>31 CAG repeats) in SCA1 locus 
      to be 0.211 of 394 chromosomes studied. We also report that the frequency of 
      large normal alleles (>22 CAG repeats) at the SCA2 locus is 0.038 while at the 
      SCA6 locus frequency of large normal alleles (>13 repeats) is 0.032. We discussed 
      our data in light of the distribution of normal alleles and prevalence of SCAs in 
      the Japanese and white populations.

TI  - Relative frequencies of CAG expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia and

PG  - 31-6
AB  - Two hundred and forty-eight patients from 116 Italian families with dominant 
      ataxia were studied for CAG expansion within SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 (spinocerebellar 
      ataxia) and DRPLA (dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy) genes. Fifty-six percent 
      of the families originated from Southern, 19% from Central and 25% from Northern 
      Italy. SCA2 was the commonest mutation, accounting for 47% of the families, 
      followed by SCA1 (24%), SCA6 (2%), SCA7 (2%) and DRPLA (1%). No SCA3 family was 
      found. Twenty-four percent of the families carried a still unidentified mutation. 
      When occurrence of mutations was evaluated according to the geographic origin, 
      SCA1 was the commonest in Northern (72%), whereas SCA2 was prevalent (63%) in 
      Southern Italy. The number of CAG repeats in SCA1 normal alleles was higher in 
      Northern than in Central-Southern Italy.

TI  - Prevalence of triplet repeat expansion in ataxia patients from Hokkaido, the 
      northernmost island of Japan.
PG  - 45-51
AB  - Approximately 44% of cases of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) in Hokkaido, the 
      northernmost island of Japan, were estimated to be inherited. To determine the 
      prevalence of triplet repeat expansion in hereditary SCA patients, we genotyped 
      seven genetically defined dominant SCAs in 349 patients, including 266 patients 
      from 77 families, 78 probands from unrelated families with hereditary late-onset 
      SCA, and five patients in whom a family history of SCA was not demonstrated. The 
      frequency of each disorder in a total of 155 unrelated families was 23.9% for 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), 29.0% for SCA6, 9.7% for SCA1, 7.7% for SCA2, and 
      2.6% for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. Abnormal expansion of triplet 
      repeats for SCA7 and SCA8 was not detected. A total of 27.1% of the patients had 
      still unknown SCA mutations. In addition, the GAA repeat in the frataxin gene was 
      not abnormally expanded in 13 early-onset SCA patients with clinical features 
      similar to those of Friedreich ataxia. Comparison of our results with those from 
      other centers handling SCA showed that MJD is prevalent throughout Japan, but the 
      frequencies of other dominant SCAs differ considerably even within Japan.

TI  - Frequency of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, and DRPLA CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in patients with hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia from Chinese 
      kindreds.
PG  - 540-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of SCA1 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 1), SCA2, 
      SCA3/MJD (spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, and 
      DRPLA (dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy) CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions 
      [(CAG)n] among persons diagnosed with hereditary SCA from Chinese families. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, 
      and DRPLA (CAG)n mutation were detected with the polymerase chain reaction, 
      highly denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and silver staining 
      technique in 167 patients with autosomal dominant SCA from 85 Chinese families 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA. RESULTS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (CAG)n 
      mutation in 7 patients from 4 kindreds (4.70%) was expanded to 53 to 62 repeats. 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (CAG)n mutation in 12 patients from 5 kindreds 
      (5.88%) was expanded to 42 to 47 repeats. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3/Machado-Joseph disease (CAG)n mutation in 83 patients from 41 kindreds (48.23%) 
      was expanded to 68 to 83 repeats. Sixty-five patients from 35 kindreds (41.19%) 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA did not test positive for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, 
      SCA6, SCA7, or DRPLA. There was a predictable inverse relationship between the 
      number of CAG repeats and the age at onset for SCA3/MJD and SCA2. Clinically, 
      dementia and hyporeflexia were more frequent in patients with SCA2, while 
      spasticity, hyperreflexia, and Babinski signs were more frequent in patients with 
      SCA3/ MJD, and those might be helpful in clinical work to primarily distinguish 
      patients with SCA3/MJD and SCA2 from others with different types of SCA. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of SCA3/MJD is substantially higher than that of SCA1 
      and SCA2 in patients with autosomal dominant SCA from Chinese kindreds, who are 
      non-Portuguese. Clinical expressions of the various types of SCAs overlap one 
      another; therefore, for clinical study it is important to make a gene diagnosis 
      and genetic classification for patients with SCA.

TI  - Absence of unidentified CAG repeat expansion in patients with Huntington's 
      disease-like phenotype.
PG  - 672-5
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by an expanded (CAG)n repeat on the huntingtin gene. It is characterised 
      by motor, psychiatric and cognitive disturbances. Diagnosis can be confirmed by 
      direct genetic testing, which is highly sensitive and specific and is now 
      considered definitive. This study focused on 21 patients presenting with a 
      clinical phenotype showing strong similarity to HD, but who do not have an 
      expanded CAG in the huntingtin gene. However, other possible diagnoses could be 
      evoked for most of them. Seven patients (3.5% of our cohort) could be considered 
      as phenocopies of HD with no alternative diagnosis. Samples were screened for 
      other triplet repeat diseases with similar presentation (DRPLA, SCA-1, SCA-2, 
      SCA-3, SCA-6, and SCA-7) and were all negative. The repeat expansion detection 
      technique (RED) was used to detect uncloned CAG repeat expansions and samples 
      were also analysed by polymerase chain reaction for expansions of the polymorphic 
      CAG-ERDA-1 and CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeats. RED expansion (>40 repeats) was 
      detected in only one patient. The results suggest that unstable CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions corresponding to known or unknown sequences are not involved in the 
      aetiology of HD-like disorders. It is hypothesised that some of these phenocopies 
      could correspond to mutations in other unidentified genes with other unstable 
      repeats (different from CAG) or in unknown genes with other mutations.

TI  - Effects of heat shock, heat shock protein 40 (HDJ-2), and proteasome inhibition 
      on protein aggregation in cellular models of Huntington's disease.
PG  - 2898-903
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxias types 1 and 3 (SCA1, SCA3), 
      and spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) are caused by CAG/polyglutamine expansion 
      mutations. A feature of these diseases is ubiquitinated intraneuronal inclusions 
      derived from the mutant proteins, which colocalize with heat shock proteins 
      (HSPs) in SCA1 and SBMA and proteasomal components in SCA1, SCA3, and SBMA. 
      Previous studies suggested that HSPs might protect against inclusion formation, 
      because overexpression of HDJ-2/HSDJ (a human HSP40 homologue) reduced ataxin-1 
      (SCA1) and androgen receptor (SBMA) aggregate formation in HeLa cells. We 
      investigated these phenomena by transiently transfecting part of huntingtin exon 
      1 in COS-7, PC12, and SH-SY5Y cells. Inclusion formation was not seen with 
      constructs expressing 23 glutamines but was repeat length and time dependent for 
      mutant constructs with 43-74 repeats. HSP70, HSP40, the 20S proteasome and 
      ubiquitin colocalized with inclusions. Treatment with heat shock and lactacystin, 
      a proteasome inhibitor, increased the proportion of mutant huntingtin exon 
      1-expressing cells with inclusions. Thus, inclusion formation may be enhanced in 
      polyglutamine diseases, if the pathological process results in proteasome 
      inhibition or a heat-shock response. Overexpression of HDJ-2/HSDJ did not modify 
      inclusion formation in PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells but increased inclusion formation 
      in COS-7 cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an HSP increasing 
      aggregation of an abnormally folded protein in mammalian cells and expands the 
      current understanding of the roles of HDJ-2/HSDJ in protein folding.

TI  - Polyglutamine expansion down-regulates specific neuronal genes before pathologic 
      changes in SCA1.
PG  - 157-63
AB  - The expansion of an unstable CAG repeat causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 
      (SCA1) and several other neurodegenerative diseases. How polyglutamine expansions 
      render the resulting proteins toxic to neurons, however, remains elusive. 
      Hypothesizing that long polyglutamine tracts alter gene expression, we found 
      certain neuronal genes involved in signal transduction and calcium homeostasis 
      sequentially downregulated in SCA1 mice. These genes were abundant in Purkinje 
      cells, the primary site of SCA1 pathogenesis; moreover, their downregulation was 
      mediated by expanded ataxin-1 and occurred before detectable pathology. Similar 
      downregulation occurred in SCA1 human tissues. Altered gene expression may be the 
      earliest mediator of polyglutamine toxicity.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat polymorphism at five disease loci in mixed Hungarian 
      population.
PG  - 245-50
AB  - In apparently healthy, unrelated Hungarians we examined triplet repeat length 
      polymorphism at Huntington disease (HD), spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy 
      (SBMA), spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA-1), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA), and myotonic dystrophy (MD) loci. The distribution of alleles of 
      the SCA-1 locus was markedly different compared with Asians and Caucasian samples 
      examined by Watkins WS, Bamshad M, and Jorde LB [1995: Hum Mol Genet 
      4:1485-1491]. The unimodal distribution of peaks was shifted towards the shorter 
      repeats on the average with 4-5 repeats. Alleles under 21 repeats at the SBMA 
      locus were significantly less frequent in Hungarians than in Asians and 
      Caucasians. We also found significant difference in the distribution of DRPLA 
      allele size at repeat length over 15 repeats; these alleles were less frequent in 
      Hungarians compared with Asians and Caucasians. No significant differences were 
      found in alleles at the MD and also at the HD loci compared with the other 
      groups. These findings suggest that these trinucleotide sites in combination with 
      other markers are particularly useful for determination of the genetic origin of 
      a population, if they can be compared with similar subset of data of other 
      populations. The present results could not confirm the large genetic distance 
      between Hungarian and Oriental races and the relatively short distance between 
      Hungarian and other European populations suggested in earlier reports [Czeizel A, 
      Benkmann H-G, Goedde HW, editors. 1991: Genetics of the Hungarian population. 
      Budapest: Akademiai Kiado. p 82-334].

PG  - 789-97
AB  - Forty-six patients suffering from autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I 
      (ADCA I) underwent to a genotype-phenotype correlation analysis by molecular 
      genetic assignment to the spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, 2, or 3 (SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3) genetic locus and electro-oculography. Oculomotor deficits that are 
      attributed to dysfunction of cerebellar structures occurred in all three 
      mutations without major differences between the groups. Gaze-evoked nystagmus, 
      however, was not found to be associated with SCA2. Square wave jerks were 
      exclusively observed in SCA3. The gain in vestibulo-ocular reflex was 
      significantly impaired in SCA3 and SCA1. In SCA3 the severity of vestibular 
      impairment increased with CAG repeat length. Severe saccade slowing was a highly 
      characteristic feature of SCA2. In SCA3 saccade velocity was normal to mildly 
      reduced while SCA1 fell into an intermediate range. The present data show that 
      each mutation is associated with a distinct syndrome of oculomotor deficits. 
      Reduced saccade velocity and the absence of both square-wave jerks and 
      gaze-evoked nystagmus allow one SCA2 to be distinguished from SCA3 patients in 
      almost all cases. The eye movement disorder of SCA1 patients, however, overlaps 
      with both SCA2 and SCA3.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias in Spanish patients: genetic analysis of familial and 
      sporadic cases. The Ataxia Study Group.
PG  - 516-22
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically heterogeneous group 
      of neurodegenerative disorders caused by unstable CAG repeat expansions encoding 
      polyglutamine tracts. Five spinocerebellar ataxia genes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 
      and SCA7) and another related dominant ataxia gene (DRPLA) have been cloned, 
      allowing the genetic classification of these disorders. We present here the 
      molecular analysis of 87 unrelated familial and 60 sporadic Spanish cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia. For ADCA cases 15% were SCA2, 15% SCA3, 6% SCA1, 3% SCA7, 
      1% SCA6 and 1% DRPLA, an extremely rare mutation in Caucasoid populations. About 
      58% of ADCA cases remained genetically unclassified. All the SCA1 cases belong to 
      the same geographical area and share a common haplotype for the SCA1 mutation. 
      The expanded alleles ranged from 41 to 59 repeats for SCA1, 35 to 46 [corrected] 
      for SCA2, 67 to 77 for SCA3, and 38 to 113 for SCA7. One SCA6 case had 25 repeats 
      and one DRPLA case had 63 repeats. The highest CAG repeat variation in meiotic 
      transmission of expanded alleles was detected in SCA7, this being of +67 units in 
      one paternal transmission and giving rise to a 113 CAG repeat allele in a patient 
      who died at 3 years of age. Meiotic transmissions have also shown a tendency to 
      more frequent paternal transmission of expanded alleles in SCA1 and maternal in 
      SCA7. All SCA1 and SCA2 expanded alleles analyzed consisted of pure CAG repeats, 
      whereas normal alleles were interrupted by 1-2 CAT trinucleotides in SCA1, except 
      for three alleles of 6, 14 and 21 CAG repeats, and by 1-3 CAA trinucleotides in 
      SCA2. No SCA or DRPLA mutations were detected in the 60 sporadic cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia, but one late onset patient was identified as a recessive 
      form due to GAA-repeat expansions in the Friedreich's ataxia gene.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat expansion of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1) found in a 
      Chinese family.
PG  - 160-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the gene mutation and the ratio of the spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 1 (SCA1) in Chinese patients with autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (ADSCA). METHOD: The family material and DNA samples were collected from 
      thirteen families with ADSCA. To determine the characteristics of the CAG 
      trinucleotide repeats in SCA1 gene, the PCR products of the Rep1 and Rep2 primers 
      were analyzed, and the bands with CAG repeat expansion were cloned by PCR2. 1 
      vector and sequenced. RESULTS: One family was found to have an expanded CAG 
      repeat in the 13 families with ADSCA. The clinically affected individual was 
      heterozygous with one disease allele being 55 CAG repeats, whereas the mean size 
      of the CAG repeats on 104 chromosomes generated from unrelated control Chinese 
      individuals is 29.3 (ranging from 18 to 34). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of the 
      SCA1 mutation is about 7% in the 13 Chinese families with ADSCA, suggesting that 
      this type of genetic defect is not the main cause involved in the pathogenesis of 
      ADSCA in China. Since the mutation has also been found in Caucasian, Japanese, 
      Malaysian, and Bangladeshi kindreds, it is suggested that this genetic defect may 
      well have multiple origins in different ethnic groups.

TI  - Mapping of a new autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia to chromosome 22.
PG  - 594-9
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) are a clinically and 
      genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. The clinical symptoms include 
      cerebellar dysfunction and associated signs from dysfunction in other parts of 
      the nervous system. So far, five spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) genes have been 
      identified: SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7. Loci for SCA4 and SCA5 have been 
      mapped. However, approximately one-third of SCAs have remained unassigned. We 
      have identified a Mexican American pedigree that segregates a new form of ataxia 
      clinically characterized by gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus. Two 
      individuals have seizures. After excluding all known genetic loci for linkage, we 
      performed a genomewide search and identified linkage to a 15-cM region on 
      chromosome 22q13. A maximum LOD score of 4.3 (recombination fraction 0) was 
      obtained for D22S928 and D22S1161. This distinct form of ataxia has been 
      designated "SCA10." Anticipation was observed in the available parent-child 
      pairs, suggesting that trinucleotide-repeat expansion may be the mutagenic 
      mechanism.

TI  - Mitotic and meiotic instability of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.
PG  - 564-9
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal, dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in the ataxin-1 gene located on chromosome 6p22-p23. The expanded CAG 
      repeat is unstable during transmission, and a variation in the CAG repeat length 
      has been found in different tissues, including sperm samples from affected males. 
      In order further to examine the mitotic and meiotic instability of the (CAG)n 
      stretch we have performed single sperm and low-copy genome analysis in SCA1 
      patients and asymptomatic carriers. A pronounced variation in the size of the 
      expanded allele was found in sperm cells and peripheral blood leucocytes, with a 
      higher degree of instability seen in the sperm cells, where an allele with 50 
      repeat units was contracted in 11.8%, further expanded in 63.5% and unchanged in 
      24.6% of the single sperm analysed. We found a low instability of the normal 
      alleles; the normal alleles from the individuals carrying a CAG repeat expansion 
      were significantly more unstable than the normal alleles from the control 
      individuals (P<0.001), indicating an interallelic interaction between the 
      expanded and the normal alleles.

TI  - Incidence of dominant spinocerebellar and Friedreich triplet repeats among 361 
      ataxia families.
PG  - 1666-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 
      3, 6, and 7 and Friedreich's ataxia (FA) among a large panel of ataxia families. 
      BACKGROUND: The ataxias are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative diseases that variably affect the cerebellum, brainstem, and 
      spinocerebellar tracts. Trinucleotide repeat expansions have been shown to be the 
      mutational mechanism for five dominantly inherited SCAs as well as FA. METHODS: 
      We collected DNA samples and clinical data from patients representing 361 
      families with adult-onset ataxia of unknown etiology. Patients with a clinical 
      diagnosis of FA were specifically excluded from our collection. RESULTS: Among 
      the 178 dominant kindreds, we found SCA1 expansion at a frequency of 5.6%, SCA2 
      expansion at a frequency of 15.2%, SCA3 expansion at a frequency of 20.8%, SCA6 
      expansion at a frequency of 15.2%, and SCA7 expansion at a frequency of 4.5%. FA 
      alleles were found in 11.4% of apparently recessive and 5.2% of apparently 
      sporadic patients. Among these patients the repeat sizes for one or both FA 
      alleles were relatively small, with sizes for the smaller allele ranging from 90 
      to 600 GAA repeats. The clinical presentation for these patients is atypical for 
      FA, with one or more of the following characteristics: adult onset of disease, 
      retained tendon reflexes, normal plantar response, and intact or partially intact 
      sensory perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogenic trinucleotide repeat expansions were 
      found among 61% of the dominant kindreds. Among patients with apparently 
      recessive or negative family histories of ataxia, 6.8% and 4.4% tested positive 
      for a CAG expansion at one of the dominant loci, and 11.4 and 5.2% of patients 
      with apparently recessive or sporadic forms of ataxia had FA expansions. Because 
      of the significant implications that a dominant versus recessive inheritance 
      pattern has for future generations, it is important to screen patients who do not 
      have a clearly dominant inheritance pattern for expansions at both the FA and the 
      dominant ataxia loci.

TI  - Expanded (CAG)n, (CGG)n and (GAA)n trinucleotide repeat microsatellites, and 
      mutant purine synthesis and pigmentation genes cause schizophrenia and autism.
PG  - 223-33
AB  - Unstable (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat microsatellites are hypothesized to cause 
      schizophrenia. The (CAG)n microsatellite of dominant spinal cerebellar ataxia 
      type 1 (SCA1) is a candidate schizophrenia gene. Autism results from expansions 
      of (CGG)n and (GAA)n trinucleotide repeat stretches at fragile X syndrome 
      (FRAXA), and the recessive Friedreich's ataxia (FA). Dominant ataxia genes may 
      cause schizophrenia and recessive ataxia genes may cause autism. Syndromes with 
      autism show purine synthesis defects (PSDs) and/or pigmentation defects (PDs). 
      Autism is caused by very lengthy expansions of (CAG)n, (CGG)n and (GAA)n repeats, 
      while schizophrenia results from much smaller (CAG)n and (CGG)n repeat 
      expansions.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I. MRI-based volumetry of posterior 
      fossa structures and basal ganglia in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2 and 3.
PG  - 1687-93
AB  - Twenty-six patients suffering from autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I 
      were subjected to a genotype-phenotype correlation analysis using molecular 
      genetic assignment to the genetic loci for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, 2 or 3 
      (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3) and MRI-based volumetry of posterior fossa structures and 
      basal ganglia nuclei. There was significant atrophy of the cerebellum and 
      brainstem in all three SCA mutations compared with a group of 31 age- and 
      sex-matched controls. Comparison between the SCA groups showed that cerebellar 
      and brainstem atrophy was more severe in SCA2 than in SCA1 and SCA3. Putaminal 
      and caudate volume was reduced only in SCA3, but not in SCA1 and SCA2. A set of 
      three morphological criteria was defined that enabled us to assign all SCA2 and 
      SCA3 patients correctly to the underlying genotype. In contrast, these criteria 
      did not distinguish SCA1 from SCA2 and SCA3. Regression analysis failed to reveal 
      a significant association between CAG repeat length and the volumes of the 
      respective brain structures in any of the SCA mutant types. The present data 
      provide in vivo evidence that SCA2 and SCA3 lead to distinct patterns of brain 
      atrophy, while the atrophy changes in SCA1 overlap with both SCA2 and SCA3.

TI  - Close associations between prevalences of dominantly inherited spinocerebellar 
      ataxias with CAG-repeat expansions and frequencies of large normal CAG alleles in 
      Japanese and Caucasian populations.
PG  - 1060-6
AB  - To test the hypothesis that the frequencies of normal alleles (ANs) with a 
      relatively large number of CAG repeats (large ANs) are related to the prevalences 
      of the dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs)-SCA types 1, 2, 3 (Machado-Joseph 
      disease), 6, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA)-we investigated the 
      relative prevalences of these diseases in 202 Japanese and 177 Caucasian families 
      and distributions of the number of CAG repeats of ANs at these disease loci in 
      normal individuals in each population. The relative prevalences of SCA1 and SCA2 
      were significantly higher in Caucasian pedigrees (15% and 14%, respectively) than 
      in Japanese pedigrees (3% and 5%, respectively), corresponding to the observation 
      that the frequencies of large ANs of SCA1 (alleles >30 repeats) and of SCA2 
      (alleles >22 repeats) were significantly higher in Caucasians than in Japanese. 
      The relative prevalences of MJD/SCA3, SCA6, and DRPLA were significantly higher 
      in Japanese pedigrees (43%, 11%, and 20%, respectively) than in Caucasian 
      pedigrees (30%, 5%, and 0%, respectively), corresponding to the observation that 
      the frequencies of large ANs of MJD/SCA3 (>27 repeats), SCA6 (>13 repeats), and 
      DRPLA (>17 repeats) were significantly higher in Japanese than in Caucasians. The 
      close correlations of the relative prevalences of the dominant SCAs with the 
      distributions of large ANs strongly support the assumption that large ANs 
      contribute to generation of expanded alleles (AEs) and the relative prevalences 
      of the dominant SCAs.

TI  - CAG repeat expansions in patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 55-9
AB  - CAG repeat expansions cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), SCA2, SCA3, 
      SCA6 and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). So far these expansions 
      have been examined mainly in ataxia patients with a family history. However, some 
      sporadic cases with SCA have recently been reported. To elucidate the frequency 
      and characteristics of sporadic SCAs, we screened 85 Japanese ataxia patients 
      without a family history for the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and DRPLA mutations. As a 
      result, 19 patients (22%) were found to have expanded CAG repeats. Among sporadic 
      SCAs, the SCA6 mutation was most frequently observed. The sporadic SCA6 patients 
      had smaller CAG repeats and a later age of onset than SCA6 patients with an 
      established family history. We also identified one father-child pair in which 
      intermediate sized CAG repeats expanded into the SCA2 disease range during 
      transmission. These findings suggest that patients with ataxia even without a 
      family history should be examined for a CAG repeat expansion.

TI  - Patients with features similar to Huntington's disease, without CAG expansion in 
      huntingtin.
PG  - 215-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe characteristics of gene-negative patients with clinical 
      features of Huntington's disease (HD), exploring likely etiologies. BACKGROUND: 
      When a direct gene test became definitive for diagnosis of HD, we discovered a 
      number of patients in our clinics in Baltimore, MD, and Cambridge, UK, believed 
      or suspected to have HD who did not have the triplet repeat expansion. METHODS: 
      Patients were examined using standardized instruments, and given full neurologic 
      and psychiatric evaluations. Those negative for HD were tested for 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy, SCA-1, SCA-3, SCA-2, SCA-6, and other 
      conditions as indicated. RESULTS: Of 15 patients, 7 received specific diagnoses 
      or appear to be sporadic cases, 4 have a possible but uncertain relation to HD, 
      and 4 have unknown familial progressive movement disorders. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      last group of patients might be properly described as phenocopies of HD, some of 
      which may be caused by unidentified triplet repeat expansions.

TI  - Analysis of SCA1, DRPLA, MJD, SCA2, and SCA6 CAG repeats in 48 Portuguese ataxia 
      families.
PG  - 134-8
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are clinically and genetically a heterogeneous 
      group of neurodegenerative disorders. To date, eight different loci causing SCA 
      have been identified: SCA1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA4, SCA5, 
      SCA6, SCA7, and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). Expansion of a CAG 
      repeat in the disease genes has been found in five of these disorders. To 
      estimate the relative frequencies of the SCA1, DRPLA, MJD, SCA2, and SCA6 
      mutations among Portuguese ataxia patients, we collected DNA samples from 48 
      ataxia families and performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of 
      the CAG repeat mutations on chromosomes 6p, 12p, 14q, 12q, and 19p, respectively. 
      Fifty-five individuals belonging to 34 dominant families (74%) had an expanded 
      CAG repeat at the MJD gene. In five individuals from two kindreds with a dominant 
      pattern of inheritance (4%), an expanded CAG repeat at the SCA2 gene was found. 
      In MJD patients, the normal allele size ranged from 13 to 41, whereas the mutant 
      alleles contained 65 to 80 repeats. For the SCA2 patients, normal alleles had 22 
      or 23, while expanded alleles had between 36 and 47 CAG units. We did not find 
      the SCA1, DRPLA, or SCA6 mutations in our group of families. The MJD mutation 
      remains the most common cause of SCA in Portugal, while a small number of cases 
      are caused by mutations at the SCA2 gene, and 22% are due to still unidentified 
      genes.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7): a neurodegenerative disorder with neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusions.
PG  - 913-8
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with progressive macular degeneration is 
      caused by a CAG/glutamine repeat expansion in the SCA7 gene/protein. Neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusions were detected in the brain of an early onset SCA7 case 
      with the 1C2 antibody directed against an expanded polyglutamine domain. Nuclear 
      inclusions were most frequent in the inferior olivary complex, a site of severe 
      neuronal loss in SCA7. They were also observed in other brain regions, including 
      the cerebral cortex, not considered to be affected in the disease. Using confocal 
      microscopy we showed that some inclusions were ubiquitinated, but to varying 
      degrees, ranging from <1% in the cerebral cortex to 60% in the inferior olive. In 
      addition, we also observed cytoplasmic staining using the 1C2 antibody, 
      particularly in the supramarginal gyrus, the hippocampus, the thalamus, the 
      lateral geniculate body and the pontine nuclei. These data confirm that the 
      presence of intranuclear inclusions in neurons is a common characteristic of 
      disorders caused by CAG/polyglutamine expansions, but unlike what has been 
      reported for Huntington's disease, SCA1 and SCA3/MJD, in SCA7 the inclusions were 
      not restricted to the sites of severe neuronal loss.

TI  - Functional analysis of the Huntington's disease (HD) gene promoter.
PG  - 791-800
AB  - The basis for the highly specific neuronal vulnerability seen in Huntington's 
      disease (HD) has not been determined. Recent studies have demonstrated that 
      variation in HD protein expression occurs in the striatum, with affected regions 
      showing increased HD immunoreactivity. Experiments in HD and SCA1 transgenic mice 
      suggest a correlation between phenotypic severity and expression of the mutant 
      transgene. To gain insights into control of HD gene expression, and to 
      investigate the possibility of cell-cell differences in transcription, we have 
      analysed the 5' upstream region of the HD gene in a neuronal (SK-N-SH) and a 
      non-neuronal (JEG3) cell line. Reporter gene assays demonstrated the presence of 
      a key positive-acting region apparently arising from two Sp1 sites in a tandem 
      repeat acting synergistically. This site is polymorphic, and a single Sp1 site is 
      associated with reduced levels of transcription. These experiments also reveal 
      differences in control of expression between neuronal and non-neuronal cell 
      lines.

TI  - The natural history of degenerative ataxia: a retrospective study in 466 
      patients.
PG  - 589-600
AB  - The aim of the present study was (i) to compare disease progression and survival 
      in different types of degenerative ataxia, and (ii) to identify variables that 
      may modify the rate of disease progression. We included patients suffering from 
      Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA, n = 83), early onset cerebellar ataxia (EOCA, n = 30), 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) type I (ADCA-I, n = 273), ADCA-III (n 
      = 13) and multiple system atrophy (MSA, n = 67). Molecular genetic testing 
      allowed us to assign 202 ADCA-I patients to one of the following subgroups: 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type I (SCAI, n = 36), SCA2 (n = 56) and SCA3 (n = 110). 
      To assess disease progression we defined the following disease stages: stage 0 = 
      no gait difficulties; stage 1 = disease onset, as defined by onset of gait 
      difficulties; stage 2 = loss of independent gait; stage 3 = confinement to 
      wheelchair; stage 4 = death. Disease progression was most rapid in MSA, 
      intermediate in FRDA, ADCA-I and ADCA-III and slowest in EOCA. The rate of 
      progression was similar in SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3. The CAG repeat length was a 
      significant risk factor for faster progression in SCA2 and SCA3, but not in SCA1. 
      In FRDA, the time until confinement to wheelchair was shorter in patients with 
      earlier disease onset, suggesting that patients with long GAA repeats and early 
      disease onset have a poor prognosis. Female gender increased the risk of becoming 
      dependent on walking aids or a wheelchair, but it did not influence survival in 
      FRDA, SCA3 and MSA. In SCA2, female gender was associated with shortened 
      survival. In MSA, later age of onset increased the risk of rapid progression and 
      death.

TI  - The role of the SCA2 trinucleotide repeat expansion in 89 autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia families. Frequency, clinical and genetic correlates.
PG  - 459-67
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is caused by a trinucleotide (CAG) 
      expansion in the coding region of the ataxin 2 gene on chromosome 12q.89 families 
      with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) types I, II and III, and 47 
      isolated cases with idiopathic late onset cerebellar ataxia (ILOCA), were 
      analysed for this mutation. The identification of the SCA2 mutation in 31 out of 
      38 families with the ADCA I phenotype, but in none of those with ADCA II, ADCA 
      III or ILOCA confirms the specificity of this mutation. A clinical comparison of 
      the ADCA I patients with the three known mutations (SCA1, -2 or -3) highlights 
      significant differences between the groups; SCA2 patients tended to have a longer 
      disease duration, a higher frequency of slow saccades and depressed tendon 
      reflexes. However, these neurological signs were also seen in an ADCA I family in 
      which the SCA2 mutation was not identified, illustrating the importance of a 
      direct genetic test. The SCA2 families were from different geographical and 
      ethnic backgrounds. However, haplotype analysis failed to show evidence of a 
      founder mutation, even in families from the same geographical origin. The range 
      of normal alleles varied from 17 to 30 CAG repeats and from 35 to 51 repeats for 
      the pathological alleles. Similar to the other diseases caused by unstable 
      trinucleotide repeats, a significant inverse correlation has been found between 
      the number of repeats and age of onset, and there is a significantly higher 
      paternal instability of repeat length on transmission to offspring. The SCA2 
      mutation is the most frequent amongst ADCA I patients, accounting for 40%, 
      compared with SCA1 and SCA3 which account for 35% and 15%, respectively.

TI  - Interruptions in the triplet repeats of SCA1 and FRAXA reduce the propensity and 
      complexity of slipped strand DNA (S-DNA) formation.
PG  - 2701-8
AB  - Models for the disease-associated expansion of trinucleotide repeats involve the 
      participation of alternative DNA structures during replication, repair, or 
      recombination. CAT or AGG interruptions within the (CAG)n or (CGG)n repeats of 
      SCA1 or FRAXA, respectively, confer increased genetic stability to the repeats. 
      In this study, we report the formation of slipped strand structures (S-DNA) using 
      genomic sequences containing pure and interrupted SCA1 and FRAXA repeats having 
      lengths above and below the genetic stability thresholds. S-DNA forms within the 
      repeats during annealing of complementary strands containing equal lengths of 
      repeats. Increased lengths of pure repeats led to an increased propensity for 
      S-DNA formation. CAT or AGG interruptions have both quantitative and qualitative 
      effects upon S-DNA formation: they decrease the total amount of slipped 
      structures as well as limit the specific isomers formed. This demonstrates a 
      unifying inhibitory effect of interruptions in both (CAG)n and (CGG)n tracts. We 
      also present transmission stability data for SCA1 and FRAXA alleles spanning the 
      thresholds and compare these with the ability to form slipped structures. The 
      effect of both the length and purity of the repeat tract on the propensity of 
      slipped structure formation correlates with their effect on genetic instability 
      and disease, suggesting that S-DNA structures may be models for mutagenic 
      intermediates in instability.

TI  - Uncloned expanded CAG/CTG repeat sequences in autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia (ADCA) detected by the repeat expansion detection (RED) method.
PG  - 99-102
AB  - In some neurodegenerative diseases, genetic anticipation correlates with 
      expansions of the CAG/CTG repeat sequence above the normal range through the 
      generations of a pedigree. Among these neurodegenerative diseases are late onset 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA). ADCA are genetically heterogeneous 
      disorders with different cloned genes for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), 
      type 2 (SCA2), type 3 or Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), and type 6 (SCA6). 
      Another related dominant ataxia, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), 
      also shows CAG/CTG repeat expansions. Genetic anticipation has been reported for 
      all of them except for the recently cloned SCA6 gene. Other, as yet undetected 
      SCA genes may show the same features. We have used the repeat expansion detection 
      (RED) method to detect repeat expansions directly in DNA samples from ADCA 
      patients not resulting from known genes. Our sample consists of 19 affected index 
      cases, corresponding to 52.8% of our ADCA families without CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions in the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, or DRPLA genes. Eighty-nine percent 
      of the index cases had expansions of a CAG/CTG sequence greater than 40 repeats 
      by RED, while these were observed in only 26.9% of 78 healthy subjects from the 
      general population (p < 0.0001). The distribution of RED fragments in controls 
      and ADCA patients also shows significant differences with the Mann-Whitney U test 
      (U = 376.5, p = 0.0007). Moreover, there was a significant inverse correlation 
      between the size of expansion and the age of onset (r = -0.54, p = 0.018). These 
      results show CAG/CTG repeat expansions of over 40 repeats in our sample of ADCA 
      families not resulting from known SCA genes.

TI  - Somatic mosaicism of the CAG repeat expansion in spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3/Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 23-7
AB  - An expanded and unstable CAG repeat in the coding region of the MJD1 gene is the 
      mutation responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia 3/Machado-Joseph disease. In 
      order to determine whether there was a higher degree of instability in affected 
      regions, the size of the expanded CAG repeat was analyzed in different regions of 
      the central nervous system, in two unrelated SCA3/MJD patients. The degree of 
      somatic mosaicism was quantified and compared to that in a SCA1 patient. 
      Instability of the expanded CAG repeat was observed in peripheral tissues as well 
      as in CNS of the three patients, but there was no correlation between the degree 
      of mosaicism and the selective vulnerability of CNS structures. As in the other 
      diseases caused by expanded CAG repeats, a lower degree of mosaicism was found in 
      the cerebellar cortex of both SCA1 and SCA3/MJD patients, probably reflecting 
      specific properties of this structure. In SCA3/MJD, the degree of mosaicism 
      seemed to correlate with age at death rather than with the size of the expanded 
      CAG repeat. Finally, somatic instability was more pronounced in SCA1 than in 
      SCA3/MJD patients.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6: genotype and phenotype in German kindreds.
PG  - 67-73
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is an autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) of which the mutation causing the disease has recently 
      been characterised as an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the gene coding for 
      the alpha1A-subunit of the voltage dependent calcium channel. The aim was to 
      further characterise the SCA6 phenotype METHODS: The SCA6 mutation was 
      investigated in 69 German families with ADCA and 61 patients with idiopathic 
      sporadic cerebellar ataxia and the CAG repeat length of the expanded allele was 
      correlated with the disease phenotype. RESULTS: Expanded alleles were found in 
      nine of 69 families as well as in four patients with sporadic disease. Disease 
      onset ranged from 30 to 71 years of age and was significantly later than in other 
      forms of ADCA. Age at onset correlated inversely with repeat length. The SCA6 
      phenotype comprises predominantly cerebellar signs in concordance with isolated 
      cerebellar atrophy on MRI. Non-cerebellar systems were only mildly affected with 
      external ophthalmoplegia, spasticity, peripheral neuropathy, and parkinsonism. 
      Neither these clinical signs nor progression rate correlated with CAG repeat 
      length. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first detailed characterisation of 
      the SCA6 phenotype. Clinical features apart from cerebellar signs were highly 
      variable in patients with SCA6. By comparison with SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 no 
      clinical or electrophysiological finding was specific for SCA6. Therefore, the 
      molecular defect cannot be predicted from clinical investigations. In Germany, 
      SCA6 accounts for about 13% of families with ADCA. However, up to 30% of SCA6 
      kindreds may be misdiagnosed clinically as sporadic disease due to late 
      manifestation in apparently healthy parents. Genetic testing is therefore 
      recommended for the SCA6 mutation also in patients with putative sporadic ataxia.

TI  - Polymorphisms at 13 expressed human sequences containing CAG/CTG repeats and 
      analysis in autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) patients.
PG  - 18-21
AB  - Genetic anticipation--increasing severity and a decrease in the age of onset with 
      successive generations of a pedigree--is clearly present in autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia (ADCA). Anticipation is correlated with expansion of the 
      CAG/CTG repeat sequence to sizes above those in the normal range through the 
      generations of a pedigree. Genetic heterogeneity has been demonstrated for ADCA, 
      with four cloned genes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, and SCA6) and three mapped loci 
      (SCA4, SCA5 and SCA7). Another related dominant ataxia, 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), presents anticipation with CAG/CTG 
      repeat expansions. We had previously analysed ADCA patients who had not shown 
      repeat expansions in cloned genes for CAG/CTG repeat expansions by the repeat 
      expansion detection method (RED) and had detected expansions of between 48 and 88 
      units in 17 unrelated familial cases. We present here an analysis of 13 genes and 
      expressed sequence tags (ESTs) containing 10 or more CAG/CTG repeat sequences 
      selected from public databases in the 17 unrelated ADCA patients. Of the 13 
      selected genes and ESTs, 9 were found to be polymorphic with heterozygosities 
      ranging between 0.09 and 0.80 and 2 to 17 alleles. In ADCA patients none of the 
      loci showed expansions above the normal range of the CAG/CTG repeat sequences, 
      excluding them as the mutation causing ADCA.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia: phenotypic differences in genetically 
      defined subtypes?
PG  - 924-32
AB  - Seventy-seven families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia were analyzed 
      for the CAG repeat expansions causing spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 
      and 6. The SCA1 mutation accounted for 9%, SCA2 for 10%, SCA3 for 42%, and SCA6 
      for 22% of German ataxia families. Seven of 27 SCA6 patients had no family 
      history of ataxia. Age at onset correlated inversely with repeat length in all 
      subtypes. Yet the average effect of one CAG unit on onset age was different for 
      each SCA subtype. We compared clinical, electrophysiological, and magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) findings to identify phenotypic characteristics of 
      genetically defined SCA subtypes. Slow saccades, hyporeflexia, myoclonus, and 
      action tremor proposed SCA2. SCA3 patients frequently developed diplopia, severe 
      spasticity or pronounced peripheral neuropathy, and impaired temperature 
      discrimination, apart from ataxia. SCA6 presented with a predominantly cerebellar 
      syndrome and patients often had onset after 55 years of age. SCA1 was 
      characterized by markedly prolonged peripheral and central motor conduction times 
      in motor evoked potentials. MRI scans showed pontine and cerebellar atrophy in 
      SCA1 and SCA2. In SCA3, enlargement of the fourth ventricle was the main sequel 
      of atrophy. SCA6 presented with pure cerebellar atrophy on MRI. However, overlap 
      between the four SCA subtypes was broad.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6: CAG repeat expansion in alpha1A voltage-dependent 
      calcium channel gene and clinical variations in Japanese population.
PG  - 879-84
AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are clinically and genetically 
      a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, mild CAG repeat 
      expansion in the alpha1A voltage-dependent calcium channel gene has been found to 
      be associated with a type of autosomal dominant SCA (SCA6). We analyzed 98 
      Japanese families with autosomal dominant SCAs, for whom CAG repeat expansions of 
      the SCA1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy genes were excluded, and 5 apparently sporadic cases of cortical 
      cerebellar atrophy. The diagnosis of SCA6 was confirmed in 30 families (31%) 
      comprising 47 affected individuals and 1 sporadic case. The size of expanded CAG 
      repeats ranged from 21 to 26 repeat units and was found to be correlated 
      inversely with age at onset. We identified 2 SCA6 patients homozygous for 
      expanded CAG repeats, whose ages at onset were earlier than the 95% lower 
      confidence level, suggesting the presence of a gene dosage effect of expanded CAG 
      repeat. Ataxia is the most common initial symptom found in 45 of the 48 patients. 
      Patients with a prolonged disease course showed other accompanying clinical 
      features including dystonic postures, involuntary movements, and abnormalities in 
      tendon reflexes.

      (SCA1) gene.
PG  - 488-93
AB  - The CAG repeat tract at the autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 
      (SCA1) locus was analyzed in SCA1 families and French-Acadian, African-American, 
      Caucasian, Greenland Inuit, and Thai populations. The normal alleles had 9-37 
      repeats, whereas disease alleles contained 44-64 repeats. The CAG repeat tract 
      contained one or two CAT interruptions in 44 of 47 normal human chromosomes and 
      in all five chimpanzees examined. In contrast, no CAT interruptions were found in 
      Old World monkeys or expanded human alleles. The number and positions of CAT 
      interruptions may be important in stabilizing CAG repeat tracts in normal 
      chromosomes. At least five codons occupy the region corresponding to the 
      polyglutamine tract at the SCA1 locus in mice, rats, and other rodents. They 
      comprise three or four CCN (coding for proline) in addition to one or two CAG 
      repeats.

TI  - The expansion of the CAG repeat in ataxin-2 is a frequent cause of autosomal 
      dominant spinocerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 1009-13
AB  - The autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (ADSCAs) are a heterogeneous group 
      of late-onset neurodegenerative disorders with overlapping clinical features. 
      Genetic linkage studies have identified at least seven distinct loci for the 
      ADSCAs, allowing the genetic classification of these disorders. The 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) locus was mapped to chromosome 12, and a 
      gene responsible for this disorder was recently isolated. The mutation causing 
      SCA2 is an expansion of a trinucleotide CAG repeat contained within the coding 
      region of a novel gene. We describe the results of genotypic analysis for the 
      SCA2 repeat in individuals with ADSCA who were previously found negative for CAG 
      repeat expansions in the SCA1, SCA3, or SCA6 genes. The expanded CAG repeat has 
      been identified in 15 independent families. Repeat instability and anticipation 
      were observed in two large kindreds. The SCA2 mutation was found in 18% of our 
      ADSCA kindreds, confirming the high proportion of SCA2 among this group of 
      disorders.

TI  - SCA6 is caused by moderate CAG expansion in the alpha1A-voltage-dependent calcium 
      channel gene.
PG  - 1289-93
AB  - Recently, moderate (CAG)>20 repeat expansions in the alpha1A-voltage-dependent 
      calcium channel gene (CACNL1A4) have been identified in a previously unmapped 
      type of SCA which has been named SCA6. We investigated the (CAG)n repeat length 
      of the CACNL1A4 gene in 733 patients with sporadic ataxia and in 46 German 
      families with dominantly inherited SCA which do not harbor the SCA1, SCA2, or 
      MJD1/SCA3 mutation, respectively. The SCA6 (CAG)n expansion was identified in 32 
      patients most frequently with late manifestation of the disease. The (CAG)n 
      stretch of the affected allele varied between 22 and 28 trinucleotide units and 
      is therefore the shortest trinucleotide repeat expansion causing spinocerebellar 
      ataxia. The (CAG)n repeat length is inversely correlated with the age at onset. 
      In 11 parental transmissions of the expanded allele no repeat instability has 
      been observed. Repeat instability was also not found for the normal allele 
      investigating 431 meioses in the CEPH families. Analyzing 248 apparently healthy 
      octogenerians revealed one allele of 18 repeats which is the longest normal CAG 
      repeat in the CACNL1A4 gene reported. The SCA6 mutation causes the disease in 
      approximately 10% of autosomal dominant SCA in Germany. Most importantly, the 
      trinucleotide expansion was observed in four ataxia patients without obvious 
      family history of the disease which necessitates a search for the SCA6 (CAG)n 
      expansion even in sporadic patients.

TI  - The CAG repeats number of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 gene in normal Taiwanese 
      and in patients with dominant inherited ataxia.
PG  - 91-5
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA 1) is an autosomal dominant disorder 
      characterized by neurodegeneration of the cerebellum, spinal cord and brainstem. 
      This neurodegeneration disease is associated with expansion of unstable CAG 
      repeats within the coding region of the gene. We are conducting a local survey of 
      the normal population and candidate patients to analyze the CAG repeats in SCA 1 
      gene. So far, we have collected peripheral blood from 78 normal individuals and 
      10 patients with dominant inherited ataxia disorders, and assayed the SCA1 CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat using genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Even though 
      no local SCA 1 patients have been identified, we have established the 
      distributions of the CAG repeat units of SCA 1 gene in the normal population in 
      Taiwan. The normal range of CAG repeats is from 22 to 33 repeats, with the most 
      common being 30 repeats. The range is relatively narrow compared to that reported 
      for other ethnic groups. In addition, direct genomic PCR analysis of the SCA 1 
      gene from villous DNA has been successful in our laboratory. Screening of SCA 1 
      patients from patients with dominant inherited ataxia is currently underway in 
      our laboratory. Here, we demonstrate that our molecular analysis technique makes 
      possible the quick and accurate diagnosis of SCA1 patients and prenatal screening 
      for SCA 1 families.

TI  - Expanded CAG repeats in spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1) segregate with distinct 
      haplotypes in South african families.
PG  - 131-7
AB  - The autosomal dominant late onset spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are genetically 
      heterogeneous. Three genes, SCA1 on 6p, SCA2 on 12q and MJD1 on 14q, have been 
      isolated for SCA1, SCA2 and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), respectively. In these 
      three autosomal dominant disorders the mutation is an expanded CAG repeat. 
      Evidence for heterogeneity in families not linked to the SCA1, SCA2 and MJD loci 
      is provided by the mapping of SCA loci to chromosomes 16q, 11cen and 3p. A total 
      of 14 South African kindreds and 22 sporadic individuals with SCA were 
      investigated for the expanded SCA1 and MJD repeats. None of the families nor the 
      sporadic individuals showed expansion of the MJD repeat. Expanded SCA1 and CAG 
      repeats were found to cosegregate with the disorder in six of the families tested 
      and were also observed in one sporadic individual with a negative family history 
      of SCA. The use of the microsatellite markers D6S260, D6S89 and D6S274 provided 
      evidence that the expanded SCA1 repeats segregated with three distinct haplotypes 
      in the six families. Use of the highly polymorphic tightly linked microsatellite 
      markers is still important as this stage, particularly where this coincides with 
      the possibility of a homozygous genotype with the trinucleotide repeat marker. 
      Importantly, our molecular findings indicate: (1) an absence of MJD expanded 
      repeats underlying SCA; (2) the major disease in this group is due to mutations 
      in the SCA1 gene; and (3) the familial disorder in the majority population group 
      (i.e. mixed ancestry) in the Western Cape region of South Africa is most likely 
      to be the result of two distinct founder events.

TI  - Analysis of amino-acid and nucleotide variants in the spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      1 (SCA1) gene in schizophrenic patients.
PG  - 772-5
AB  - Several loci-containing genes that might harbour mutations predisposing to 
      schizophrenia have recently been identified. The locus on chromosome 6p has been 
      detected by several groups and appears to predispose to schizophrenia in 15%-30% 
      of the pedigrees in one of these studies. The chromosome 6p locus for 
      schizophrenia spans about 30 cM, between markers D6S296 and D6S276. The current 
      transcription map of the 6p22-24 region includes three expressed sequence tags 
      and six genes, one of which is the spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) gene. 
      Patients with SCA1 have the CAG repeat sequence, which encodes a polyglutamine 
      stretch in the ataxin-1 protein, expanded beyond the normal range. More recently, 
      linkage disequilibrium between schizophrenia and the SCA1 CAG repeat has been 
      reported. SCA1 is a good candidate gene for the schizophrenia-susceptibility 
      locus on chromosome 6p as indicated by its expression pattern. We have studied 
      the coding region of the SCA1 gene (exons 8 and 9) in samples from schizophrenia 
      patients and have identified two amino-acid variants (S186C and P754S) and three 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (1409A/G, 1865T/C and 2150A/G). One of the amino-acid 
      changes (S186C) was present in two schizophrenic brothers from one family and in 
      a schizophrenic patient and a non-affected subject of a second family but it was 
      not detected in 100 unrelated subjects from the general population. S186C and 
      other variants may be of relevance to the complex genetic factors involved in 
      schizophrenia phenotypes.

TI  - Analysis of the CAG repeats in the SCA1 and B37 genes in schizophrenic and 
      bipolar I disorder patients: tentative association between B37 and schizophrenia.
PG  - 324-30
AB  - We have genotyped unrelated French Alsatian schizophrenic and bipolar I disorder 
      (BPD) patients and matched controls for the polymorphic CAG repeats within the 
      genes for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (B37), in order to test their possible involvement in these disorders. No 
      alleles with abnormally expanded repeats were found in either gene in patients 
      and controls. Differences in allele and genotype frequencies for the SCA1 CAG 
      repeat between patients and controls were not significant, thus providing no 
      support for its role as a possible positional candidate gene for schizophrenia 
      and BPD in our patients. Chi square testing revealed a significant result (P = 
      0.019) for an association between the B37 CAG repeat on chromosome 12p and 
      schizophrenia. This result was more significant when only schizophrenics with a 
      positive family history were compared with controls (P = 0.0001). The frequencies 
      of alleles with 14, 12, and 15 CAG repeats differed the most, respectively, 
      between schizophrenics and controls. When choosing the median of the B37 allele 
      distribution (15 CAG repeats) as a threshold, there were significantly more 
      controls than schizophrenics in the group with longer alleles (15 or more 
      repeats) and more schizophrenics with shorter alleles (P = 0.002 by Fisher exact 
      test). No particular genotype was associated with schizophrenia. This result 
      possibly indicates linkage disequilibrium with another locus on chromosome 12p 
      and therefore deserves further attention. No association was found between the 
      B37 CAG repeat and patients with BPD.

TI  - SCA2 trinucleotide expansion in German SCA patients.
PG  - 59-64
AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a group of clinically and 
      genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders which lead to progressive 
      cerebellar ataxia. A gene responsible for SCA type 2 has been mapped to human 
      chromosome 12 and the disease causing mutation has been identified as an unstable 
      and expanded (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat. We investigated the (CAG)n repeat 
      length of the SCA2 gene in 842 patients with sporadic ataxia and in 96 German 
      families with dominantly inherited SCA which do not harbor the SCA1 or MJD1/SCA3 
      mutation, respectively. The SCA2 (CAG)n expansion was identified in 71 patients 
      from 54 families. The (CAG)n stretch of the affected allele varied between 36 and 
      64 trinucleotide units. Significant repeat expansions occurred most commonly 
      during paternal transmission. Analysis of the (CAG)n repeat lengths with the age 
      of onset in 41 patients revealed an inverse correlation. Two hundred and 
      forty-one apparently healthy octogenerians carried alleles between 16 and 31 
      repeats. One 50-year old, healthy individual had 34 repeats; she had transmitted 
      an expanded allele to her child. The small difference between 'normal' and 
      disease alleles makes it necessary to define the extreme values of their ranges. 
      With one exception, the trinucleotide expansion was not observed in 842 ataxia 
      patients without a family history of the disease. The SCA2 mutation causes the 
      disease in nearly 14% of autosomal dominant SCA in Germany.

TI  - Brain regional differences in the expansion of a CAG repeat in the 
      spinocerebellar ataxias: dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, Machado-Joseph 
      disease, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.
PG  - 505-11
AB  - Three autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA), Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 
      (SCA1), are associated with the expansion of a CAG repeat in the respective 
      genes. To investigate the association between CAG repeat expansion and 
      neuropathological findings, we analyzed several brain regions from 9 cases of 
      DRPLA, 3 cases of MJD, and 1 case of SCA1. We found that the expanded alleles 
      were smaller in the cerebellar cortex than in other brain regions, such as the 
      frontal cortex, in these three diseases. The discrepancy in the expanded CAG 
      repeat length between cerebellar cortex and other tissues was most prominent in 
      DRPLA, and especially in cases of adult-onset DRPLA. A significant correlation 
      was found between the age at onset of DRPLA and the size of the CAG repeat 
      expansion. Cerebella of DRPLA patients were microscopically dissected into three 
      layers, the molecular and granular layers and the white matter, which were 
      analyzed separately. The lower level of CAG repeat expansion in DRPLA cerebella 
      was representative of CAG repeat expansion in the granule cells. The 
      microdissected samples of the granular layer of the hippocampal formation, which 
      is densely packed with neuronal cells, revealed that the degree of CAG repeat 
      expansion in this layer was similar to that in the cerebellum. These observations 
      suggest that granule cells in the cerebellum and hippocampus have low levels of 
      CAG repeat expansion, and that other types of cells exhibit a higher level of CAG 
      repeat expansion, in spinocerebellar ataxias.

      and coordination. The utility of genetic classification of the ADCAs has been 
      highlighted by the striking variability in clinical phenotype observed within 
      families and the overlap in clinical phenotype observed between those with 
      different genotypes. The recent demonstration that spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      (SCA2) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion within the ataxin-2 gene has allowed 
      us to determine the frequency of SCA2 compared with SCA1, SCA3/Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD), and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) in patients with 
      sporadic and inherited ataxia. SCA2 accounts for 13% of patients with ADCA 
      (without retinal degeneration), intermediate between SCA1 and SCA3/MJD, which 
      account for 6% and 23%, respectively. Together, SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3/MJD 
      constitute >40% of the mutations leading to ADCA I in our population. No patient 
      without a family history of ataxia, or with a pure cerebellar or spastic 
      syndrome, tested positive for SCA1, SCA2, or SCA3. No overlap in ataxin-2 allele 
      size between normal and disease chromosomes, or intermediate-sized alleles, were 
      observed. Repeat length correlated inversely with age at onset, accounting for 
      approximately 80% of the variability in onset age. Haplotype analysis provided no 
      evidence for a single founder chromosome, and diverse ethnic origins were 
      observed among SCA2 kindreds. In addition, a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes 
      was observed among SCA2 patients, including typical mild dominant ataxia, the MJD 
      phenotype with facial fasciculations and lid retraction, and early-onset ataxia 
      with a rapid course, chorea, and dementia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine ocular changes in patients with spinocerebellar 
      degeneration who have repeated trinucleotide expansion in the spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 1 (SCA1) gene. DESIGN: Ophthalmic findings in 6 patients from 3 
      families whose DNA analysis revealed that they had an expanded allele of the 
      trinucleotide repeated in the SCA1 gene were compared with those of normal 
      control subjects and other healthy family members. The DNA was extracted from 
      peripheral blood lymphocytes of the neurodegenerative family and normal control 
      subjects. SETTING: University medical center. RESULTS: Visual acuity gradually 
      decreased in successive follow-up visits. Color vision and visual fields were 
      gradually affected. Electroretinograms showed mild attenuation of oscillatory 
      potentials. Corneal endothelial cell density was severely decreased from 600 to 
      1300 cells/mm2. These findings were not observed in the normal control subjects, 
      other healthy family members, or other patients with spinocerebellar degeneration 
      who had repeated trinucleotide expansion of other genes. CONCLUSION: To the best 
      of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the association between 
      ocular changes in patients with spinocerebellar degeneration and gene mutation. 
      These ocular changes were considered specific to patients who had the expanded 
      allele of the repeated trinucleotide in the SCA1 gene.

TI  - Instability of highly expanded CAG repeats in mice transgenic for the 
      Huntington's disease mutation.
PG  - 197-200
AB  - Six inherited neurodegenerative diseases are caused by a CAG/polyglutamine 
      expansion, including spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), Huntington's 
      disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), dentatorubral pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA) Machado-Joseph disease (MJD or SCA3) and SCA2. Normal and 
      expanded HD allele sizes of 6-39 and 35-121 repeats have been reported, and the 
      allele distributions for the other diseases are comparable. Intergenerational 
      instability has been described in all cases, and repeats tend to be more unstable 
      on paternal transmission. This may present as larger increases on paternal 
      inheritance as in HD, or as a tendency to increase on male and decrease on female 
      transmission as in SCA1 (ref. 15). Somatic repeat instability is also apparent 
      and appears most pronounced in the CNS. The major exception is the cerebellum, 
      which in HD, DRPLA, SCA1 and MJD has a smaller repeat relative to the other brain 
      regions tested. Of non-CNS tissues, instability was observed in blood, liver, 
      kidney and colon. A mouse model of CAG repeat instability would be helpful in 
      unravelling its molecular basis although an absence of CAG repeat instability in 
      transgenic mice has so far been reported. These studies include (CAG) in the 
      androgen receptor cDNA, (CAG) in the HD cDNA, (CAG) in the SCA1 cDNA, (CAG) in 
      the SCA3 cDNA and as an isolated (CAG) tract.

TI  - Estimated contribution of known ataxia genes in ataxia patients undergoing DNA 
      testing.
PG  - 275-8
AB  - We estimated the relative contributions of known ataxia genes (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 
      and X25) in the patient population sent to our DNA diagnostic laboratory for 
      diagnostic testing. Approximately 28% of these patients had an abnormal triplet 
      repeat expansion in one of these ataxia genes (3% for SCA1, 8% for SCA2, 11% for 
      SCA3/MJD, 2% for SCA6, 3% for SCA7, and 1.5% for X25). The lack of abnormal 
      repeat expansions in the majority of ataxis patients tested suggests that the 
      molecular defects associated with most ataxia cases are currently undetermined 
      and that this population includes both familial and sporadic cases. In contrast, 
      of the patients submitted for genetic testing for Friedrich's ataxia (FRDA), 44% 
      (69/157) showed at least one expansion in the X25 gene, indicating that FRDA 
      accounts for a significant proportion of the recessively inherited ataxias and 
      appears to have a high rate of accurate clinical diagnosis. On the basis of our 
      DNA studies, we propose a comprehensive and efficient approach for molecular 
      analysis of ataxia patients.

TI  - The repeat expansion detection method in the analysis of diseases with CAG/CTG 
      repeat expansion: usefulness and limitations.
PG  - 486-8
AB  - The repeat expansion detection (RED) method was described to detect expansions of 
      trinucleotide repeats of unknown chromosomal location. We have improved the RED 
      method by the use of 8-mer oligonucleotides and assessed its usefulness in 30 
      samples from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), Huntington's 
      disease (HD), and Machado Joseph's disease (MJD), for which the number of CAG/CTG 
      repeats was determined by sequencing. There was a good correlation between the 
      number of repeats detected by sequencing and those identified by RED. However, in 
      17% of samples, the RED gave additional fragments for ligation products of 
      different size than the CAG/CTG repeat expansion detected in the sample by 
      sequencing. The same was observed in a group of control subjects (n = 78) without 
      known clinical abnormalities in which products of more than 40 repeats were 
      detected in 27% of them, indicating that CAG/CTG repeat expansions are common in 
      the general population. Wether this corresponds to unidentified loci with 
      expansions deserves further investigation.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 is caused by the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat, located at the 5' end of the gene responsible for the disease (SCA1 
      gene). We propose a simple and rapid method for SCA1 diagnosis, avoiding both 
      radioactive and Southern blotting analysis. The method allows an accurate allele 
      sizing by visualization of polymerase chain reaction products through a silver 
      nitrate-stained polyacrylamide gel.

TI  - Peptides containing glutamine repeats as substrates for 
      transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking: relevance to diseases of the nervous 
      system.
PG  - 14580-5
AB  - Many proteins contain reiterated glutamine residues, but polyglutamine of 
      excessive length may result in human disease by conferring new properties on the 
      protein containing it. One established property of a glutamine residue, depending 
      on the nature of the flanking residues, is its ability to act as an amine 
      acceptor in a transglutaminase-catalyzed reaction and to make a glutamyl-lysine 
      cross-link with a neighboring polypeptide. To learn whether glutamine repeats can 
      act as amine acceptors, we have made peptides with variable lengths of 
      polyglutamine flanked by the adjacent amino acid residues in the proteins 
      associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), Machado-Joseph disease 
      (SCA3), or dentato-rubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) or those residues 
      adjacent to the preferred cross-linking site of involucrin, or solely by arginine 
      residues. The polyglutamine was found to confer excellent substrate properties on 
      any soluble peptide; under optimal conditions, virtually all the glutamine 
      residues acted as amine acceptors in the reaction with glycine ethyl-ester, and 
      lengthening the sequence of polyglutamine increased the reactivity of each 
      glutamine residue. In the presence of transglutaminase, peptides containing 
      polyglutamine formed insoluble aggregates with the proteins of brain extracts and 
      these aggregates contained glutamyl-lysine cross-links. Repeated glutamine 
      residues exposed on the surface of a neuronal protein should form cross-linked 
      aggregates in the presence of any transglutaminase activated by the presence of 
      Ca2+.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias in the Kinki area of Japan.
PG  - 399-406
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders characterized by slowly progressive cerebellar 
      ataxia. Recently, among the ataxias, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy have been 
      found to be caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the coding 
      region of the disease genes. We have analyzed the CAG repeats of 67 patients from 
      47 families with dominantly inherited ataxia who lived in the Kinki area of 
      Japan. The following results were obtained. First, 31 patients from 22 families 
      were found to be positive for the MJD repeat expansion, indicating that MJD is 
      the most common dominantly inherited ataxia in the Kinki area of Japan. Second, 
      no SCA1 repeat expansion was found among the families studied. This presents a 
      striking contrast to the fact that there are many families with SCA1 in Hokkaido 
      and the Tohoku area of Japan. These findings suggest geographic variation in 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias in Japan.

TI  - Screening for proteins with polyglutamine expansions in autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxias.
PG  - 1887-92
AB  - Expansion of trinucleotide CAG repeats coding for polyglutamine has been 
      implicated in five neurodegenerative disorders, including spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) 1 and SCA3 or Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), two forms of type I 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA). Using the 1C2 antibody which 
      specifically recognizes large polyglutamine tracts, particularly those that are 
      expanded, we recently reported the detection of proteins with pathological 
      glutamine expansions in lymphoblasts from another form of ADCA type I, SCA2, as 
      well as from patients presenting with the distinct phenotype of ADCA type II. We 
      now have screened a large series of patients with ADCA or isolated cases with 
      cerebellar ataxia, for the presence of proteins with polyglutamine expansions. A 
      150 kDa SCA2 protein was detected in 16 out of 40 families with ADCA type I. This 
      corresponds to 24% of all ADCA type I families, which is much more frequent than 
      SCA1 in this series of patients (13%). The signal intensity of the SCA2 protein 
      was negatively correlated to age at onset, as expected for an expanded and 
      unstable trinucleotide repeat mutation. The disease segregated with markers 
      closely linked to the SCA2 locus in all identified SCA2 families. In addition, a 
      specific 130 kDa protein, which segregated with the disease, was detected in 
      lymphoblasts of patients from nine families with ADCA type II. It was also 
      visualized in the cerebral cortex of one of the patients, demonstrating its 
      translation in the nervous system. Finally, no new disease-related proteins 
      containing expanded polyglutamine tracts could be detected in lymphoblasts from 
      the remaining patients with ADCA or isolated cases with cerebellar ataxia.

TI  - Genetic fitness in Huntington's Disease and Spinocerebellar Ataxia 1: a 
      population genetics model for CAG repeat expansions.
PG  - 423-35
AB  - An analysis of genetic fitness was performed in Huntington's Disease (HD) and 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia 1 (SCA1) families. Two partially overlapping samples were 
      used: clinically defined HD and SCA1 patients from families ascertained in 
      definite geographical areas, and molecularly typed carriers of HD and SCA1 
      mutations (CAG trinucleotide expansions). In both cases, a control group of 
      normal relatives was used. HD and SCA1 patients born before 1915-20 had more 
      children than normal controls. Carriers of HD and SCA1 mutations, all in the 
      low/medium expansion range (37-49 and 47-54 CAG repeats respectively), had a 
      higher number of children than controls up to more recent times (1935-1950). The 
      reproduction of heterozygotes for large expansions could be analysed only in 
      subjects born after 1950 and provided indirect evidence of a lower than normal 
      number of children. The above results fit a model based on a differential fitness 
      according to the degree of expansion. Such a model predicts that 1) up to 
      relatively recently the frequency of alleles in the low/medium range has been 
      maintained or even increased by the increased fitness of their carriers, as well 
      as by new mutations, and 2) the frequency of large expansions, part of which are 
      lost at each generation, is maintained through further expansions of alleles in 
      the low/medium expansion range. The implications of such a model on linkage 
      disequilibrium and the possible spread of these diseases in future generations 
      are discussed.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 in Russia.
PG  - 506-10
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is one form of autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia (ADCA) caused by trinucleotide (CAG) repeat expansion within a mutant 
      gene. We investigated 25 patients from 15 Russian ADCA families for SCA1 mutation 
      and found an expanded CAG repeat in 5 families. Mutant chromosomes contained 
      41-51 CAG repeats (mean 46.1, SD 3.1), and normal chromosomes displayed 21-27 
      repeat units (mean 24.7, SD 1.3). Progressive cerebellar ataxia in our series of 
      SCA1 patients was very commonly associated with dysarthria (in all cases) and 
      pyramidal signs (in 10 of 11 cases). In three patients from one family we found 
      optic atrophy, which has never been described before in genetically proven cases 
      of SCA1. We observed no specific clinical features distinguishing SCA1 from 
      non-SCA1 patients. In contrast to the high frequency of SCA1 in our series, we 
      found no patients with Machado-Joseph disease, another form of ADCA caused by 
      expanded CAG repeat.

TI  - Reevaluation of the exact CAG repeat length in hereditary cerebellar ataxias 
      using highly denaturing conditions and long PCR.
PG  - 591-5
AB  - Hereditary cerebellar ataxias, including spinocerebellar ataxia type I (SCA1), 
      dentato-rubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), 
      have been associated with unstable CAG repeats. The length of the CAG repeat is a 
      major factor in determining the age of onset of these diseases. In 
      electrophoresis through acrylamide gels with formamide, the CAG repeat length 
      following the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coincides with the 
      sequence-determined repeat length after subcloning. However, without formamide, 
      PCR products with long CAG repeats appear 1-4 repeats shorter than when 
      electrophoresed with formamide, and the repeat lengths are variable. In addition, 
      the larger the CAG repeats are, the more difficult are the PCR reactions. A 
      mixture containing thermostable Taq and Pwo DNA polymerases (so-called "long 
      PCR") is much more sensitive than that with Taq polymerase alone in detecting- 
      expanded CAG repeats. Therefore, highly denaturing conditions, especially 
      formamide gel electrophoresis, and the "long PCR" protocol should be used to 
      evaluate the exact CAG repeat length. We have used these principles to detect 
      unstable CAG repeats. The normal ranges are 14-34 repeats for MJD, 6-31 repeats 
      for DRPLA, and 21-32 repeats for SCA1.

TI  - Analysis of CAG trinucleotide expansion associated with Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 101-7
AB  - There are currently some types of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias such as 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), spinocerebellar ataxia types 1-5 (SCA1-5), or 
      hereditary dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy. It is very important for these 
      ataxias to be clinically differentiated, but that is sometimes difficult. In 
      particular, the differential diagnosis between MJD and SCA1 is thought to be the 
      most difficult. Recently, both MJD and SCA1 have been proven to be related to 
      expansions of CAG trinucleotide in their causative genes. In this study, 20 cases 
      of MJD in 13 unrelated Japanese families were genetically and clinically examined 
      in comparison with 20 cases of age at onset- and duration-matched Japanese SCA1. 
      The CAG repeat number of expanded MJD and SCA1 alleles was 72.2 +/- 3.1 (mean +/- 
      SD, n = 20) and 47.3 +/- 4.4 (n = 20), respectively, and each repeat size was 
      inversely correlated with age at onset in both MJD and SCA1. The repeat number in 
      leukocytes increased from parents to children with acceleration of age at onset 
      (anticipation) in MJD. In MJD, the number of CAG repeats in the expanded allele 
      was lower in sperm than that of leukocytes, but was more in SCA1. However, the 
      number of peaks in the expanded allele was greater in sperm than in leukocytes in 
      both MJD and SCA1 (increased mosaicism level). MJD was clinically characterized 
      by a relatively higher frequency of ocular signs such as eyelid retraction, 
      bulging eyes, ophthalmoparesis, and nystagmus, spasticity in lower limbs, and 
      sensory and urinary disturbances in contrast to the SCA1 patients except for slow 
      eye movement. These results indicate that the expanded CAG repeat and clinical 
      features are correlated in both MJD and SCA1, and MJD can be differentiated from 
      SCA1 by clinical characteristics mentioned above as well as DNA analysis.

TI  - Mutation detection in Machado-Joseph disease using repeat expansion detection.
PG  - 77-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several neurological disorders have recently been explained through 
      the discovery of expanded DNA repeat sequences. Among these is Machado-Joseph 
      disease, one of the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (MJD/SCA3), caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion on chromosome 14. A useful way of detecting repeat sequence 
      mutations is offered by the repeat expansion detection method (RED), in which a 
      thermostable ligase is used to detect repeat expansions directly from genomic 
      DNA. We have used RED to detect CAG expansions in families with either MJD/SCA3 
      or with previously uncharacterized spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Five MJD/SCA3 families and one SCA family where linkage to SCA1-5 had 
      been excluded were analyzed by RED and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: 
      An expansion represented by RED products of 180-270 bp segregated with MJD/SCA3 
      (p < 0.00001) in five families (n = 60) and PCR products corresponding to 66-80 
      repeat copies were observed in all affected individuals. We also detected a 
      210-bp RED product segregating with disease (p < 0.01) in a non-SCA1-5 family (n 
      = 16), suggesting involvement of a CAG expansion in the pathophysiology. PCR 
      analysis subsequently revealed an elongated MJD/SCA3 allele in all affected 
      family members. CONCLUSIONS: RED products detected in Machado-Joseph disease 
      families correlated with elongated PCR products at the MJD/SCA3 locus. We 
      demonstrate the added usefulness of RED in detecting repeat expansions in 
      disorders where linkage is complicated by phenotyping problems in gradually 
      developing adult-onset disorders, as in the non-SCA1-5 family examined. The RED 
      method is informative without any knowledge of flanking sequences. This is 
      particularly useful when studying diseases where the mutated gene is unknown. We 
      conclude that RED is a reliable method for analyzing expanded repeat sequences in 
      the genome.

TI  - Frequency of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy, 
      and Machado-Joseph disease mutations in a large group of spinocerebellar ataxia 
      patients.
PG  - 214-8
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders varying in both clinical manifestations and mode of inheritance. Six 
      different genes causing autosomal dominant SCA are mapped: SCA1, SCA2, 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA4, SCA5, and dentatorubropallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA). Expansions of an unstable trinucleotide CAG repeat cause three 
      of these disorders: SCA type 1 (SCA1), MJD, and DRPLA. We determine the frequency 
      of the SCA1, DRPLA, and MJD mutations in a large group of unrelated SCA patients 
      with various patterns of inheritance and different ethnic backgrounds. We studied 
      92 unrelated SCA patients. The frequency of the SCA1 mutation was 3% in the 
      overall patient group and 10% in the non-Portuguese dominantly inherited SCA 
      subgroup. We found that DRPLA mutation in only one Japanese patient, who was 
      previously diagnosed with this disease. We identified the MJD mutation in 41% of 
      the overall patient group, which included 38 autosomal dominant kindreds of 
      Portuguese origin; the frequency of the MJD mutation among the non-Portuguese 
      dominantly inherited cases was 17%. These results suggest that SCA may be 
      occasionally caused by the SCA1 mutation and rarely caused by the DRPLA mutation 
      and that, to date, the MJD mutation seems to be the most common cause of 
      dominantly inherited SCA. Finally, our results suggest that recessively inherited 
      cases of SCA are not caused by the known trinucleotide repeat expansions.

TI  - Anomalous rapid electrophoretic mobility of DNA containing triplet repeats 
      associated with human disease genes.
PG  - 16125-31
AB  - Eight human genetic diseases have been associated with the expansion of CTG or 
      CGG triplet repeats. The molecular etiology behind expansion is unknown but may 
      involve participation of an unusual DNA structure in replication, repair, or 
      recombination. We show that DNA fragments containing CTG triplet repeats derived 
      from the human myotonic dystrophy gene migrate up to 20% faster than expected in 
      nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, suggesting the presence of an unusual DNA 
      helix structure within the CTG triplet repeats. The anomalous migration is 
      dependent upon the number of triplet repeats, the length of the flanking DNA, and 
      the percentage and temperature of the polyacrylamide. The effect could be reduced 
      by the addition of actinomycin D. Applying a reptation model for electrophoresis, 
      the results are consistent with a 20% increase in persistence length of the DNA. 
      PCR products containing CTG or CGG repeats from the spinocerebellar ataxia type I 
      gene (SCA1) or the fragile X FMR1 gene, respectively, also showed higher 
      electrophoretic mobility. These are the first sequences of defined length for 
      which a dramatic increase in mobility can be attributed to sequence-dependent 
      structural elements in DNA.

      trinucleotide repeat expansion in families with autosomal dominant motor 
      disorders, including the Drew family of Walworth.
PG  - 1077-85
AB  - Affected members of 63 families with a variety of autosomal dominant late onset 
      cerebellar ataxias (ADCA), and 29 patients with similar phenotypes but no 
      affected relatives, were investigated for the trinucleotide (CAG) repeat 
      expansion described in Japanese families with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). This 
      disorder had previously been shown to map to the region of chromosome 14 which 
      also contains a locus causing ADCA in French families, spinocerebellar ataxia 3 
      (SCA3). The MJD/SCA3 mutation was identified in nine families with ADCA type I, 
      and a further family in which affected members had parkinsonism, peripheral 
      neuropathy, dystonia, and spasticity, but little evidence of cerebellar disease. 
      Only one of the 10 families was British (the Drew family of Walworth); the others 
      originated from India, Jamaica, Ghana, Brazil and France. There was no single 
      clinical feature which distinguished patients with the MJD/SCA3 mutation from 
      those with the CAG expansion on chromosome 6 (SCA1) or ADCA type I families with 
      no known mutation. The CAG repeat length ranged from 13-41 copies on normal 
      chromosomes and 62-80 copies on affected chromosomes. There was a significant 
      inverse correlation between age of onset of symptoms and repeat length, but no 
      significant effect of parental sex on repeat length or age of onset in offspring. 
      DNA analysis for the MJD/SCA3 mutation is useful for diagnosis in patients with 
      familial ataxic or extrapyramidal syndromes, and will aid genetic counselling in 
      these disorders.

TI  - SCA1 transgenic mice: a model for neurodegeneration caused by an expanded CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat.
PG  - 937-48
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder 
      characterized by degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells, spinocerebellar 
      tracts, and selective brainstem neurons owing to the expansion of an unstable CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of the SCA1 mutation 
      and the intergenerational stability of trinucleotide repeats in mice, we have 
      generated transgenic mice expressing the human SCA1 gene with either a normal or 
      an expanded CAG tract. Both transgenes were stable in parent to offspring 
      transmissions. While all six transgenic lines expressing the unexpanded human 
      SCA1 allele had normal Purkinje cells, transgenic animals from five of six lines 
      with the expanded SCA1 allele developed ataxia and Purkinje cell degeneration. 
      These data indicate that expanded CAG repeats expressed in Purkinje cells are 
      sufficient to produce degeneration and ataxia and demonstrate that a mouse model 
      can be established for neurodegeneration caused by CAG repeat expansions.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat. We analyzed CAG repeat expansion in one 
      Japanese SCA1 family with mild clinical manifestations. Clinically, this SCA1 
      family showed less frequent nystagmus (p = 0.045, Fisher's exact-test) in 
      comparison with duration-matched control patients with larger numbers of CAG 
      repeats (48.4 +/- 4.2, p < 0.01). Some patients showed no other signs than 
      cerebellar ataxia in the earlier stage. All six patients had expanded alleles for 
      SCA1 with relatively small CAG repeats (41.5 +/- 1.0, mean +/- SD), which may be 
      related to the mild clinical symptoms of the disease. The present results also 
      suggest that slow saccades and amyotrophy are constantly observed in 30-40% of 
      SCA1 patients without regard to the size of CAG repeats, while the frequency of 
      nystagmus decreases with reduction in size of the CAG expansion.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 and Machado-Joseph disease: incidence of CAG 
      expansions among adult-onset ataxia patients from 311 families with dominant, 
      recessive, or sporadic ataxia.
PG  - 603-8
AB  - The ataxias are a complex group of diseases with both environmental and genetic 
      causes. Among the autosomal dominant forms of ataxia the genes for two, 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), have been 
      isolated. In both of these disorders the molecular basis of disease is the 
      expansion of an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat. To assess the frequency of the 
      SCA1 and MJD trinucleotide repeat expansions among individuals diagnosed with 
      ataxia we have collected DNA from individuals representing 311 families with 
      adult-onset ataxia of unknown etiology and screened these samples for 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions within the SCA1 and MJD genes. Within this group 
      there are 149 families with dominantly inherited ataxia. Of these, 3% had SCA1 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions, whereas 21% were positive for the MJD 
      trinucleotide expansion. Thus, together SCA1 and MJD represent 24% of the 
      autosomal dominant ataxias in our group, and the frequency of MJD is 
      substantially greater than that of SCA1. For the 57 patients with MJD 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions, a strong inverse correlation between CAG repeat 
      size and age at onset was observed (r = -.838). Among the MJD patients, the 
      normal and affected ranges of CAG repeat size are 14-40 and 68-82 repeats, 
      respectively. For SCA1 the normal and affected ranges are much closer, containing 
      19-38 and 40-81 CAG repeats, respectively.

TI  - Analysis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1)-related CAG trinucleotide 
      expansion in Japan.
PG  - 1587-94
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat. We analyzed CAG repeat expansion in 25 
      families in the northeast of Japan with hereditary ataxia of Menzel type. Twenty 
      of 38 patients in 12 families had expanded allele for SCA1. The number of CAG 
      repeats correlated with the age at onset. Although the relationship between 
      anticipation and the number of CAG repeats in successive generations was not 
      ascertainable, there was a tendency to paternal bias for the accelerated age at 
      onset. Study of the number of CAG repeats in various tissues showed no 
      differences in the repeat length in lymphocytes, muscle, or brain; sperm, 
      however, showed an obvious expansion. This may be a clue to a possible mechanism 
      for the molecular basis of paternal anticipation of the disease. The SCA1 gene 
      was transcribed from both wild and mutated alleles in muscles of affected 
      individuals, but the repeat length was the same for both the muscle cDNA and the 
      lymphocyte genomic DNA. These results suggest that, in the area of Japan where 
      SCA1 is prevalent, 48% of families with spinocerebellar degeneration have SCA1 
      mutation.

TI  - Familial periodic cerebellar ataxia without myokymia maps to a 19-cM region on 
      19p13.
PG  - 1443-9
AB  - Familial periodic cerebellar ataxia (FPCA) is a heterogeneous group of rare 
      autosomal dominant disorders characterized by episodic cerebellar disturbance. A 
      potassium-channel gene (KCNA1) has been found to be responsible for one of its 
      subgroups, familial periodic cerebellar ataxia with myokymia (FPCA/+M; MIM 
      160120). A different subgroup that is not associated with myokymia (FPCA/-M; MIM 
      108500) was recently mapped to chromosome 19p. Here we have performed linkage 
      analysis in two large families with FPCA/-M that also demonstrated 
      neurodegenerative pathology of the cerebellum. Three markers in 19p13 gave 
      significant lod scores (> 3.0), while linkage to KCNA1 and three known loci for 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3) was excluded. The highest lod score 
      was obtained with the marker D19S413 (4.4 at recombination fraction 0), and 
      identification of meiotic recombinants in affected individuals placed the locus 
      between the flanking markers D19S406 and D19S226, narrowing the interval to 19 
      cM. A CAG trinucleotide-repeat expansion was detected in one family but did not 
      cosegregate with the disease.

TI  - Clinical, neuropathologic, and genetic studies of a large spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 1 (SCA1) kindred: (CAG)n expansion and early premonitory signs and symptoms.
PG  - 24-30
AB  - We report the clinical, neuropathologic, and genetic studies of a large kindred 
      (family M-ADCA1) with autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), 
      ascertained in 41 members, with clinical data available in twenty-two. The mean 
      age of onset was 36.3 +/- 6.2 years (ages, 26 to 52), the mean duration of the 
      disease was 15.8 +/- 6.5 years (range, 10 to 28 years), and the mean age at death 
      was 54.1 +/- 9.5 years (ages, 39 to 72). Premonitory signs and symptoms appeared 
      earlier than the usual onset symptoms in many of the clinically unaffected 
      patients who inherited the mutated SCA1 gene. Anticipation was present when we 
      compared the seventh and eighth generations. A more severe course of the disease 
      occurred in offspring of affected males. Neuropathologic examination, performed 
      on three patients, showed the usual findings of SCA1; Golgi and 
      immunocytochemistry studies suggested primary damage of the Purkinje cells. We 
      analyzed the CAG-repeat mutation responsible for the SCA1 phenotype in a total of 
      41 family members. There was expansion in 19 subjects (10 clinically affected, 
      seven with early signs and symptoms, and two asymptomatic individuals), and all 
      showed heterozygosity, with one allele between 41 and 59 repeats (SCA1 mutation) 
      and the other in the range of 6 to 39 repeats (normal range). The clinical 
      analysis of "at risk" patients with the SCA1 mutation showed that minor signs and 
      symptoms begin before full clinical diagnosis, and these premonitory 
      manifestations can herald full development of SCA1 by years.

      for familial effects on the age at onset.
PG  - 244-52
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias are a group of debilitating neurodegenerative 
      diseases for which a clinical classification system has proved unreliable. We 
      have recently isolated the gene for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and have 
      shown that the disease is caused by an expanded, unstable, CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat within an expressed gene. Normal alleles have a size range of 19-36 
      repeats, while SCA1 alleles have 42-81 repeats. In this study, we examined the 
      frequency and variability of the SCA1 repeat expansion in 87 kindreds with 
      diverse ethnic backgrounds and dominantly inherited ataxia. All nine families for 
      which linkage to the SCA1 region of 6p had previously been established showed 
      repeat expansion, while 3 of the remaining 78 showed a similar abnormality. For 
      113 patients from the families with repeat expansion, inverse correlations 
      between CAG repeat size and both age at onset and disease duration were observed. 
      Repeat size accounted for 66% of the variation in age at onset in these patients. 
      After correction for repeat size, interfamilial differences in age at onset 
      remained significant, suggesting that additional genetic factors affect the 
      expression of the SCA1 gene product.

PG  - 645-9
AB  - Affected members of 73 families with a variety of autosomal dominant late onset 
      cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) were investigated for the trinucleotide (CAG) repeat 
      expansion which is found in pedigrees exhibiting linkage to the SCA1 locus on 
      chromosome 6. Most of the families were too small for linkage analysis. The 
      mutation was only found in ADCA type I, in 19 out of 38 such kindreds 
      investigated (50%). It was slightly more common in Italian (59%) than British 
      (50%) families, and was also found in Malaysian, Bangladeshi and Jamaican 
      kindreds. Overall, ADCA type I patients with the expansion had a lower incidence 
      of hyporeflexia and facial fasciculation than those without. The trinucleotide 
      expansion was not found in eight families with ADCA and maculopathy or 24 
      kindreds with a pure type of ADCA, confirming that these syndromes are 
      genetically distinct. It was also not detected in 12 patients with sporadic 
      degenerative ataxias. DNA analysis for the SCA1 mutation is useful diagnostically 
      in single patients or small families, and can be used for presymptomatic testing 
      where appropriate.

PG  - 959-65
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansion has been found in 64 subjects from 19 families: 57 
      patients with SCA1 and 7 subjects predicted, by haplotype analysis, to carry the 
      mutation. Comparison with a large set of normal chromosomes shows two distinct 
      distributions, with a much wider variation among expanded chromosomes. The sex of 
      transmitting parent plays a major role in the size distribution of expanded 
      alleles, those with > 54 repeats being transmitted by affected fathers 
      exclusively. Our data suggest that alleles with > 54 repeats have a reduced 
      chance of survival; these appear to be replaced in each generation by further 
      expansion of alleles in the low- to medium-expanded repeat range, preferentially 
      in male transmissions. Detailed clinical follow-up of a subset of our patients 
      demonstrates significant relationships between increasing repeat number on 
      expanded chromosomes and earlier age at onset, faster progression of the disease, 
      and earlier age at death.

AB  - The triplet repeat sequences (CGG)n, (GCT)n, and (CAG)n, which naturally occur in

      (Curschmann-Steinert), to spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy disease), 
      and recently to Huntington disease. A GCC trinucleotide repeat was found to be 
      expanded and methylated in the fragile site FRAXE on the human X chromosome. 
      These findings were associated with mental retardation (Knight et al., 1993). In 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), a polymorphic CAG repeat was found to be 
      unstable and expanded in individuals with that disease (Orr et al., 1993). We 
      have demonstrated in in vitro experiments that the synthetic 
      oligodeoxyribonucleotides (CGG)17, (CGG)12, (GCC)17, (CG)25, (CTG)17, or (CAG)17 
      plus (GTC)17, in the absence of added natural DNA, can be expanded with Taq 
      polymerase in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Some expansion can already be 
      detected after 4 PCR cycles. The E. coli Klenow DNA polymerase also functions in 
      a similar amplification and expansion reaction performed at 37 degrees C without 
      cycling. Other oligodeoxyribonucleotides, like, (CGG)7, (CGGT)13, or (TAA)17, are 
      devoid of this property or have very low activity. The cytidine-methylated 
      polymers (GCC)17 or (CG)25 yield expansion products of considerably reduced chain 
      lengths. The expansion of the polymer (CGG)17 is affected by cytidine methylation 
      to a lesser degree. A specific sequence and/or secondary structure and high CG 
      content appear to be requirements for this expansion reaction by a possible 
      slippage mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type 1 (ADCA1) is a clinical and genetic 
      heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder which leads to progressive cerebellar 
      ataxia. One defective gene responsible for the disease was first localised to 6p 
      (SCA1, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1) and the mutation has been more recently 
      characterised. We have analysed the CAG-repeat mutation responsible for the SCA1 
      phenotype in a large Spanish kindred with 41 affected members, in which positive 
      linkage with D6S89 was previously shown. All (10) clinically affected members 
      analysed were heterozygous with one disease allele being between 41 to 57 CAG 
      repeats, and the other in the normal range, from 6 to 39 repeats. Nine clinically 
      unaffected individuals who were between the ages of 18 and 40, were found to have 
      expansions of the CAG repeat (41 to 59), and 22 other 'at risk' individuals were 
      found to have inherited the SCA1 gene with copies of the CAG repeat in the normal 
      range. We have also observed that affected fathers passed on the mutated SCA1 
      gene with larger increases in the number of CAG repeats than affected mothers 
      did. In one case a decrease in the number of CAG repeats (51 to 50) was detected 
      in the transmission from the affected mother, and in two cases no change was 
      observed in the transmission of a 41 allele repeat by a mother. As in the other 
      disorders in which knowledge of the mutation has been obtained, analysis of the 
      repeat expansion dramatically changes diagnosis of SCA1.

TI  - Expansion of an unstable trinucleotide CAG repeat in spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      1.
PG  - 221-6
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant disorder 
      characterized by neurodegeneration of the cerebellum, spinal cord and brainstem. 
      A 1.2-Megabase stretch of DNA from the short arm of chromosome 6 containing the 
      SCA1 locus was isolated in a yeast artificial chromosome contig and subcloned 
      into cosmids. A highly polymorphic CAG repeat was identified in this region and 
      was found to be unstable and expanded in individuals with SCA1. There is a direct 
      correlation between the size of the (CAG)n repeat expansion and the age-of-onset 
      of SCA1, with larger alleles occurring in juvenile cases. We also show that the 
      repeat is present in a 10 kilobase mRNA transcript. SCA1 is therefore the fifth 
      genetic disorder to display a mutational mechanism involving an unstable 
      trinucleotide repeat.
