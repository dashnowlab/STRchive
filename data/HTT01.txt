AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The variable CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin 
      gene and its inverse relationship to motor dysfunction onset are fundamental 
      features of Huntington disease (HD). However, the wider phenotype (including 
      non-motor features) at particular CAG lengths, ages, and functional levels is 
      less well-characterized. The large number of participants in the Enroll-HD 
      observational study enables the development of a phenotype atlas that summarizes 
      the range and distribution of HD phenotypes, including outliers and possible 
      clusters, with respect to various CAG repeat lengths, age ranges, and declining 
      functional levels. METHODS: Enroll-HD is an ongoing prospective longitudinal 
      observational study that collects natural history data, releasing periodic data 
      sets, in people with HD (PwHD) and controls. Core assessments at annual visits 
      focus on behavioral, cognitive, motor, and functional status. Periodic data set 
      5, used for the development of the first iteration of the Enroll-HD Phenotype 
      Atlas (EHDPA), included all eligible data collected through October 31, 2020. The 
      atlas is based on subsets (cells) of descriptive data for all motor, cognitive, 
      psychiatric, and functional measures that are routinely collected at most 
      Enroll-HD sites, analyzed by single CAG lengths and 5-year age blocks. RESULTS: 
      Data from 42,840 visits from 15,982 unique PwHD were available for analysis. At 
      baseline, participants had a mean +/- SD age of 48.9 +/- 13.9 years and CAG repeat 
      length of 43.4 +/- 3.6 and 54.1% were female. The EHDPA includes 223 age-by-CAG 
      subsets for CAG repeats between 36 and 69 with five-year age brackets starting 
      from 20-24 years up to 85-89 years. The atlas can be browsed at 
      enroll-hd.org/for-researchers/atlas-of-hd-phenotype/. DISCUSSION: The EHDPA 
      summarizes the spectrum and distribution of HD phenotypes, including outliers and 
      possible clusters, in all domains of disease involvement for the range of CAG 
      repeat lengths, ages, and functional levels. Its availability in an easy-to-use 
      online format will assist clinicians in tracking disease progression in PwHD by 
      identifying phenotypic features most associated with loss of function and 
      enabling conversations related to prognosis. The observable patterns in the EHDPA 
      should also catalyze more formal multidomain characterization of motor, 
      cognitive, and psychiatric progression and their relationships to functional 
      decline and disease modifiers. TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: Enroll-HD is 
      registered with clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01574053.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a dominantly 
      inherited CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT). Neuroinflammation 
      and microglia have been implicated in HD pathology, however it has been unclear 
      if mutant HTT (mHTT) expression has an adverse cell-autonomous effect on 
      microglial function, or if they are only activated in response to the 
      neurodegenerative brain environment in HD. To establish a human cell model of HD 
      microglia function, we generated isogenic controls for HD patient-derived induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) with 109 CAG repeats (Q109). Q109 and isogenic Q22 
      iPSC, as well as non-isogenic Q60 and Q33 iPSC lines, were differentiated to 
      iPSC-microglia. Our study supports a model of basal microglia dysfunction in HD 
      leading to elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine production together with impaired 
      phagocytosis and endocytosis capacity, in the absence of immune stimulation. 
      These findings are consistent with early microglia activation observed in 
      pre-manifest patients and indicate that mHTT gene expression affects microglia 
      function in a cell-autonomous way.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the epidemiology of Huntington's disease (HD) in Korea 
      differs notably from that in Western countries, the genetic disparities between 
      these regions remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics and 
      clinical significance of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat size associated 
      with HD in the Korean population. METHODS: We analyzed the CAG repeat lengths of 
      the HTT gene in 941 healthy individuals (1,882 alleles) and 954 patients with 
      chorea (1,908 alleles) from two referral hospitals in Korea. We presented 
      normative CAG repeat length data for the Korean population and computed the 
      reduced penetrance (36-39 CAG) and intermediate allele (27-35 CAG) frequencies in 
      the two groups. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between 
      intermediate alleles and chorea development using logistic regression models in 
      individuals aged >/=55 years. RESULTS: The mean (+/-standard deviation) CAG repeat 
      length in healthy individuals was 17.5 +/- 2.0, with a reduced penetrance allele 
      frequency of 0.05 % (1/1882) and intermediate allele frequency of 0.69 % 
      (13/1882). We identified 213 patients with genetically confirmed HD whose CAG 
      repeat length ranged from 39 to 140, with a mean of 45.2 +/- 7.9 in the longer 
      allele. Compared with normal CAG repeat alleles, intermediate CAG repeat alleles 
      were significantly related to a higher risk of developing chorea (age of onset 
      range, 63-84 years) in individuals aged >/=55 years. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      provides insights into the specific characteristics of CAG repeat lengths in the 
      HTT gene in the Korean population. The reduced penetrance and intermediate allele 
      frequencies in the Korean general population seem to be lower than those reported 
      in Western populations. The presence of intermediate alleles may increase the 
      risk of chorea in the Korean elderly population, which requires further 
      large-scale investigations.

AB  - Both Huntington's disease (HD) and Spinocerebellar ataxia 17 (SCA17) mutations 
      showed expanded CAG repeats, with overlapping clinical manifestation: motor 
      disorders, psychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairments. Therefore, SCA17 is 
      also called Huntington like disease (HD-like, HDL) type 4. In this paper, we 
      reported that one patient had 47 CAG repeats in HTT gene and 42 CAG repeats in 
      TBP gene. There is a dilemma in differentiation of SCA 17 from HD in one patient, 
      never been reported before. Is the diagnosis comorbidity of HD with SCA17 or HD 
      only?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder 
      characterized by personality changes (such as irritability and restlessness) and 
      psychotic symptoms (such as hallucinations and delusions). When the personality 
      changes become noticeable, involuntary movements (chorea) also develop. The 
      disease is caused by the CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of the HTT 
      gene, and the diagnosis is based on the presence of this expansion. However, 
      there is currently no effective treatment for the progression of Huntington's 
      disease and its involuntary motor symptoms. Herein, we present a case in which 
      memantine was effective in treating the chorea movements of Huntington's disease. 
      CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old Japanese woman presented to the hospital with 
      involuntary movements of Huntington's disease that began when she was 73 years 
      old. In a cerebral blood flow test (N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine-single-photon 
      emission computed tomography), decreased blood flow was observed in the precuneus 
      (anterior wedge) and posterior cingulate gyrus. Usually, such areas of decreased 
      blood flow are observed in patients with Alzheimer's-type dementia. So, we 
      administered memantine for Alzheimer's-type dementia, and this treatment 
      suppressed the involuntary movements of Huntington's disease, and the symptoms 
      progressed slowly for 7 years after the onset of senility. In contrast, her 
      brother died of complications of pneumonia during the course of Huntington's 
      disease. CONCLUSIONS: We recorded changes in parameters such as the results of 
      the N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine-single-photon emission computed tomography and 
      gait videos over 7 years. Treatment with memantine prevented the chorea movement 
      and the progression of Huntington's disease. We believe this record will provide 
      clinicians with valuable information in diagnosing and treating Huntington's 
      disease.

AB  - Alternative splicing (AS) appears to be altered in Huntington's disease (HD), but 
      its significance for early, pre-symptomatic disease stages has not been 
      inspected. Here, taking advantage of Htt CAG knock-in mouse in vitro and in vivo 
      models, we demonstrate a correlation between Htt CAG repeat length and increased 
      aberrant linear AS, specifically affecting neural progenitors and, in vivo, the 
      striatum prior to overt behavioral phenotypes stages. Remarkably, a significant 
      proportion (36%) of the aberrantly spliced isoforms are not-functional and meant 
      to non-sense mediated decay (NMD). The expanded Htt CAG repeats further reflect 
      on a previously neglected, global impairment of back-splicing, leading to 
      decreased circular RNAs production in neural progenitors. Integrative 
      transcriptomic analyses unveil a network of transcriptionally altered micro-RNAs 
      and RNA-binding proteins (Celf, hnRNPs, Ptbp, Srsf, Upf1, Ythd2) which might 
      influence the AS machinery, primarily in neural cells. We suggest that this 
      unbalanced expression of linear and circular RNAs might alter neural fitness, 
      contributing to HD pathogenesis.

AB  - Expansions of repeat DNA tracts cause >70 diseases, and ongoing expansions in 
      brains exacerbate disease. During expansion mutations, single-stranded DNAs 
      (ssDNAs) form slipped-DNAs. We find the ssDNA-binding complexes canonical 
      replication protein A (RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3) and Alternative-RPA (RPA1, RPA3, and 
      primate-specific RPA4) are upregulated in Huntington disease and spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 1 (SCA1) patient brains. Protein interactomes of RPA and Alt-RPA 
      reveal unique and shared partners, including modifiers of CAG instability and 
      disease presentation. RPA enhances in vitro melting, FAN1 excision, and repair of 
      slipped-CAGs and protects against CAG expansions in human cells. RPA 
      overexpression in SCA1 mouse brains ablates expansions, coincident with decreased 
      ATXN1 aggregation, reduced brain DNA damage, improved neuron morphology, and 
      rescued motor phenotypes. In contrast, Alt-RPA inhibits melting, FAN1 excision, 
      and repair of slipped-CAGs and promotes CAG expansions. These findings suggest a 
      functional interplay between the two RPAs where Alt-RPA may antagonistically 
      offset RPA's suppression of disease-associated repeat expansions, which may 
      extend to other DNA processes.

TI  - Investigating Neuron Degeneration in Huntington's Disease Using RNA-Seq Based 
      Transcriptome Study.
LID - 10.3390/genes14091801 [doi]
LID - 1801
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused due 
      to a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. The primary symptoms of 
      HD include motor dysfunction such as chorea, dystonia, and involuntary movements. 
      The primary motor cortex (BA4) is the key brain region responsible for executing 
      motor/movement activities. Investigating patient and control samples from the BA4 
      region will provide a deeper understanding of the genes responsible for neuron 
      degeneration and help to identify potential markers. Previous studies have 
      focused on overall differential gene expression and associated biological 
      functions. In this study, we illustrate the relationship between variants and 
      differentially expressed genes/transcripts. We identified variants and their 
      associated genes along with the quantification of genes and transcripts. We also 
      predicted the effect of variants on various regulatory activities and found that 
      many variants are regulating gene expression. Variants affecting miRNA and its 
      targets are also highlighted in our study. Co-expression network studies revealed 
      the role of novel genes. Function interaction network analysis unveiled the 
      importance of genes involved in vesicle-mediated transport. From this unified 
      approach, we propose that genes expressed in immune cells are crucial for 
      reducing neuron death in HD.

AB  - Huntington's disease is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin gene 
      (HTT), coding for polyglutamine in the Huntingtin protein, with longer CAG 
      repeats causing earlier age of onset. The variable 'Age' x ('CAG'-L), where 'Age' 
      is the current age of the individual, 'CAG' is the repeat length and L is a 
      constant (reflecting an approximation of the threshold), termed the 'CAG Age 
      Product' (CAP) enables the consideration of many individuals with different CAG 
      repeat expansions at the same time for analysis of any variable and graphing 
      using the CAG Age Product score as the X axis. Structural MRI studies have showed 
      that progressive striatal atrophy begins many years prior to the onset of 
      diagnosable motor Huntington's disease, confirmed by longitudinal multicentre 
      studies on three continents, including PREDICT-HD, TRACK-HD and IMAGE-HD. 
      However, previous studies have not clarified the relationship between striatal 
      atrophy, atrophy of other basal ganglia structures, and atrophy of other brain 
      regions. The present study has analysed all three longitudinal datasets together 
      using a single image segmentation algorithm and combining data from a large 
      number of subjects across a range of CAG Age Product score. In addition, we have 
      used a strategy of normalizing regional atrophy to atrophy of the whole brain, in 
      order to determine which regions may undergo preferential degeneration. This made 
      possible the detailed characterization of regional brain atrophy in relation to 
      CAG Age Product score. There is dramatic selective atrophy of regions involved in 
      the basal ganglia circuit-caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus 
      and substantia nigra. Most other regions of the brain appear to have slower but 
      steady degeneration. These results support (but certainly do not prove) the 
      hypothesis of circuit-based spread of pathology in Huntington's disease, possibly 
      due to spread of mutant Htt protein, though other connection-based mechanisms are 
      possible. Therapeutic targets related to prion-like spread of pathology or other 
      mechanisms may be suggested. In addition, they have implications for current 
      neurosurgical therapeutic approaches, since delivery of therapeutic agents solely 
      to the caudate and putamen may miss other structures affected early, such as 
      nucleus accumbens and output nuclei of the striatum, the substantia nigra and the 
      globus pallidus.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon1 of the huntingtin gene (HTT). 
      This expansion leads to the production of N-terminal mutant huntingtin protein 
      (mHtt) that contains an expanded polyglutamine tract, which is toxic to neurons 
      and causes neurodegeneration. While the production of N-terminal mHtt can be 
      mediated by proteolytic cleavage of full-length mHtt, abnormal splicing of 
      exon1-intron1 of mHtt has also been identified in the brains of HD mice and 
      patients. However, the proportion of aberrantly spliced exon1 mHTT in relation to 
      normal mHTT exon remains to be defined. In this study, HTT exon1 production was 
      examined in the HD knock-in (KI) pig model, which more closely recapitulates 
      neuropathology seen in HD patient brains than HD mouse models. The study revealed 
      that aberrant spliced HTT exon1 is also present in the brains of HD pigs, but it 
      is expressed at a much lower level than the normally spliced HTT exon products. 
      These findings suggest that careful consideration is needed when assessing the 
      contribution of aberrantly spliced mHTT exon1 to HD pathogenesis, and further 
      rigorous investigation is required.

AB  - Changes in the brain of patients with Huntington's disease (HD) begin years 
      before clinical onset, so it remains critical to identify biomarkers to track 
      these early changes. Metrics derived from tensor modeling of diffusion-weighted 
      MRIs (DTI), that indicate the microscopic brain structure, can add important 
      information to regional volumetric measurements. This study uses two large-scale 
      longitudinal, multicenter datasets, PREDICT-HD and IMAGE-HD, to trace changes in 
      DTI of HD participants with a broad range of CAP scores (a product of CAG repeat 
      expansion and age), including those with pre-manifest disease (i.e., prior to 
      clinical onset). Utilizing a fully automated data-driven approach to study the 
      whole brain divided in regions of interest, we traced changes in DTI metrics 
      (diffusivity and fractional anisotropy) versus CAP scores, using sigmoidal and 
      linear regression models. We identified points of inflection in the sigmoidal 
      regression using change-point analysis. The deep gray matter showed more evident 
      and earlier changes in DTI metrics over CAP scores, compared to the deep white 
      matter. In the deep white matter, these changes were more evident and occurred 
      earlier in superior and posterior areas, compared to anterior and inferior areas. 
      The curves of mean diffusivity vs. age of HD participants within a fixed CAP 
      score were different from those of controls, indicating that the disease has an 
      additional effect to age on the microscopic brain structure. These results show 
      the regional and temporal vulnerability of the white matter and deep gray matter 
      in HD, with potential implications for experimental therapeutics.

TI  - Arginine methylation of RNA-binding proteins is impaired in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 3006-3025
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddad125 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the HD gene, coding for huntingtin protein (HTT). 
      Mechanisms of HD cellular pathogenesis remain undefined and likely involve 
      disruptions in many cellular processes and functions presumably mediated by 
      abnormal protein interactions of mutant HTT. We previously found HTT interaction 
      with several protein arginine methyl-transferase (PRMT) enzymes. Protein arginine 
      methylation mediated by PRMT enzymes is an important post-translational 
      modification with an emerging role in neurodegeneration. We found that normal 
      (but not mutant) HTT can facilitate the activity of PRMTs in vitro and the 
      formation of arginine methylation complexes. These interactions appear to be 
      disrupted in HD neurons. This suggests an additional functional role for HTT/PRMT 
      interactions, not limited to substrate/enzyme relationship, which may result in 
      global changes in arginine protein methylation in HD. Our quantitative analysis 
      of striatal precursor neuron proteome indicated that arginine protein methylation 
      is significantly altered in HD. We identified a cluster highly enriched in 
      RNA-binding proteins with reduced arginine methylation, which is essential to 
      their function in RNA processing and splicing. We found that several of these 
      proteins interact with HTT, and their RNA-binding and localization are affected 
      in HD cells likely due to a compromised arginine methylation and/or abnormal 
      interactions with mutant HTT. These studies reveal a potential new mechanism for 
      disruption of RNA processing in HD, involving a direct interaction of HTT with 
      methyl-transferase enzymes and modulation of their activity and highlighting 
      methylation of arginine as potential new therapeutic target for HD.

TI  - Establishment and characterization of a novel cell line (SCCOHT-CH-1) and PDX

AB  - Small cell carcinoma of the ovary hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare and 
      aggressive malignancy that poses a significant clinical challenge due to its grim 
      prognosis. Unfortunately, only three SCCOHT cell lines are currently available 
      for scientific research. In this study, we have successfully established a novel 
      SCCOHT cell line from a recurrent lesion of a SCCOHT patient, named SCCOHT-CH-1. 
      We comprehensively characterized the novel cell line by employing techniques such 
      as morphological observation, CCK-8 assay, Transwell assay, clone formation 
      assay, short tandem repeat sequence (STR) analysis, karyotype analysis, 
      immunohistochemical staining, western blot assay, and xenograft tumor formation 
      assay. SCCOHT-CH-1 cells were small circular and had a unique STR profile. The 
      population-doubling time of SCCOHT-CH-1 was 33.02 h. The cell line showed 
      potential migratory and invasive ability. Compared with another SCCOHT cell line 
      COV434, SCCOHT-CH-1 exhibited higher expression of AKT, VIM, and CCND1. At the 
      same time, SCCOHT-CH-1 has the ability of tumorigenesis in vivo. We also 
      successfully constructed three patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of SCCOHT, 
      which were pathologically diagnosed to be consistent with the primary tumor, 
      accompanied by loss of SAMRCA4 protein expression. The establishment of 
      SCCOHT-CH-1 cell line and PDX models from Chinese people represent a pivotal step 
      toward unraveling the molecular mechanism of SCCOHT and fostering the development 
      of targeted interventions to tackle this challenging malignancy.

AB  - Brain changes at the end-stage of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS) are largely unknown due to mobility impairment. We conducted a postmortem 
      MRI study of FXTAS to quantify cerebrovascular disease, brain atrophy and iron 
      content, and examined their relationships using principal component analysis 
      (PCA). Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) was observed in 4/17 FXTAS cases, among 
      which one was confirmed by histologic staining. Compared with seven control 
      brains, FXTAS cases showed higher ratings of T2-hyperintensities (indicating 
      cerebral small vessel disease) in the cerebellum, globus pallidus and 
      frontoparietal white matter, and significant atrophy in the cerebellar white 
      matter, red nucleus and dentate nucleus. PCA of FXTAS cases revealed negative 
      associations of T2-hyperintensity ratings with anatomic volumes and iron content 
      in the white matter, hippocampus and amygdala, that were independent from a 
      highly correlated number of regions with ICH and iron content in subcortical 
      nuclei. Post-hoc analysis confirmed PCA findings and further revealed increased 
      iron content in the white matter, hippocampus and amygdala in FXTAS cases 
      compared to controls, after adjusting for T2-hyperintensity ratings. These 
      findings indicate that both ischemic and hemorrhagic brain damage may occur in 
      FXTAS, with the former being marked by demyelination/iron depletion and atrophy, 
      and the latter by ICH and iron accumulation in basal ganglia.

TI  - Machine learning in Huntington's disease: exploring the Enroll-HD dataset for 
      prognosis and driving capability prediction.
PG  - 218

AB  - BACKGROUND: In biomedicine, machine learning (ML) has proven beneficial for the 
      prognosis and diagnosis of different diseases, including cancer and 
      neurodegenerative disorders. For rare diseases, however, the requirement for 
      large datasets often prevents this approach. Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the coding region 
      of the huntingtin gene. The world's largest observational study for HD, 
      Enroll-HD, describes over 21,000 participants. As such, Enroll-HD is amenable to 
      ML methods. In this study, we pre-processed and imputed Enroll-HD with ML methods 
      to maximise the inclusion of participants and variables. With this dataset we 
      developed models to improve the prediction of the age at onset (AAO) and compared 
      it to the well-established Langbehn formula. In addition, we used recurrent 
      neural networks (RNNs) to demonstrate the utility of ML methods for longitudinal 
      datasets, assessing driving capabilities by learning from previous participant 
      assessments. RESULTS: Simple pre-processing imputed around 42% of missing values 
      in Enroll-HD. Also, 167 variables were retained as a result of imputing with ML. 
      We found that multiple ML models were able to outperform the Langbehn formula. 
      The best ML model (light gradient boosting machine) improved the prognosis of AAO 
      compared to the Langbehn formula by 9.2%, based on root mean squared error in the 
      test set. In addition, our ML model provides more accurate prognosis for a wider 
      CAG repeat range compared to the Langbehn formula. Driving capability was 
      predicted with an accuracy of 85.2%. The resulting pre-processing workflow and 
      code to train the ML models are available to be used for related HD predictions 
      at: https://github.com/JasperO98/hdml/tree/main . CONCLUSIONS: Our pre-processing 
      workflow made it possible to resolve the missing values and include most 
      participants and variables in Enroll-HD. We show the added value of a ML 
      approach, which improved AAO predictions and allowed for the development of an 
      advisory model that can assist clinicians and participants in estimating future 
      driving capability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Huntington's disease (HD), a CAG repeat expansion mutation in the 
      Huntingtin (HTT) gene drives a gain-of-function toxicity that disrupts mRNA 
      processing. Although dysregulation of gene splicing has been shown in human HD 
      post-mortem brain tissue, post-mortem analyses are likely confounded by cell type 
      composition changes in late-stage HD, limiting the ability to identify 
      dysregulation related to early pathogenesis. METHODS: To investigate gene 
      splicing changes in early HD, we performed alternative splicing analyses coupled 
      with a proteogenomics approach to identify early CAG length-associated splicing 
      changes in an established isogenic HD cell model. FINDINGS: We report widespread 
      neuronal differentiation stage- and CAG length-dependent splicing changes, and 
      find an enrichment of RNA processing, neuronal function, and epigenetic 
      modification-related genes with mutant HTT-associated splicing. When integrated 
      with a proteomics dataset, we identified several of these differential splicing 
      events at the protein level. By comparing with human post-mortem and mouse model 
      data, we identified common patterns of altered splicing from embryonic stem cells 
      through to post-mortem striatal tissue. INTERPRETATION: We show that widespread 
      splicing dysregulation in HD occurs in an early cell model of neuronal 
      development. Importantly, we observe HD-associated splicing changes in our HD 
      cell model that were also identified in human HD striatum and mouse model HD 
      striatum, suggesting that splicing-associated pathogenesis possibly occurs early 
      in neuronal development and persists to later stages of disease. Together, our

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG-repeat 
      expansions in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. The resulting mutant HTT (mHTT) protein 
      induces toxicity and cell death via multiple mechanisms and no effective therapy 
      is available. Here, we employ a genome-wide screening in pluripotent mouse 
      embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to identify suppressors of mHTT toxicity. Among the 
      identified suppressors, linked to HD-associated processes, we focus on Metal 
      response element binding transcription factor 1 (Mtf1). Forced expression of Mtf1 
      counteracts cell death and oxidative stress caused by mHTT in mouse ESCs and in 
      human neuronal precursor cells. In zebrafish, Mtf1 reduces malformations and 
      apoptosis induced by mHTT. In R6/2 mice, Mtf1 ablates motor defects and reduces 
      mHTT aggregates and oxidative stress. Our screening strategy enables a quick in 
      vitro identification of promising suppressor genes and their validation in vivo, 
      and it can be applied to other monogenic diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To perform a screening for Huntington disease (HD) phenocopies in a 
      Swedish cohort. METHODS: Seventy-three DNA samples negative for HD were assessed 
      at a tertiary center in Stockholm. The screening included analyses for 
      C9orf72-frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9orf72-FTD/ALS), 
      octapeptide repeat insertions (OPRIs) in PRNP associated with inherited prion 
      diseases (IPD), Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2), spinocerebellar ataxia-2 
      (SCA2), spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) and spinocerebellar ataxia-17 (SCA17). 
      Targeted genetic analysis was carried out in two cases based on the salient 
      phenotypic features. RESULTS: The screening identified two patients with SCA17, 
      one patient with IPD associated with 5-OPRI but none with nucleotide expansions 
      in C9orf72 or for HDL2, SCA2 or SCA3. Furthermore, SGCE-myoclonic-dystonia 11 
      (SGCE-M-D) and benign hereditary chorea (BHC) was diagnosed in two sporadic 
      cases. WES identified VUS in STUB1 in two patients with predominant cerebellar 
      ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in keeping with previous screenings and 
      suggest that other genes yet to be discovered are involved in the etiology of HD 
      phenocopies.

AB  - Neurodegeneration in Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is 
      caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of FMR1. Expanded 
      CGG repeat RNAs form stable secondary structures, which in turn support 
      repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation to produce toxic peptides. The 
      parameters that impact RAN translation initiation efficiency are not well 
      understood. Here we used a Drosophila melanogaster model of FXTAS to evaluate the 
      role of the eIF4G family of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (EIF4G1, 
      EIF4GII and EIF4G2/DAP5) in modulating RAN translation and CGG repeat-associated 
      toxicity. DAP5 knockdown robustly suppressed CGG repeat-associated toxicity and 
      inhibited RAN translation. Furthermore, knockdown of initiation factors that 
      preferentially associate with DAP5 (such as EIF2beta, EIF3F and EIF3G) also 
      selectively suppressed CGG repeat-induced eye degeneration. In mammalian cellular 
      reporter assays, DAP5 knockdown exhibited modest and cell-type specific effects 
      on RAN translation. Taken together, these data support a role for DAP5 in CGG 
      repeat associated toxicity possibly through modulation of RAN translation.

AB  - TAR binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is normally present in the nucleus but 
      mislocalized in the cytoplasm in a number of neurodegenerative diseases including 
      Huntington's disease (HD). The nuclear loss of TDP-43 impairs gene transcription 
      and regulation. However, it remains to be investigated whether loss of TDP-43 
      influences trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion in the HD gene, a genetic cause for 
      HD. Here we report that CRISPR/Cas9 mediated-knock down of endogenous TDP-43 in 
      the striatum of HD knock-in mice promoted CAG repeat expansion, accompanied by 
      the increased expression of the DNA mismatch repair genes, Msh3 and Mlh1, which 
      have been reported to increase trinucleotide repeat instability. Furthermore, 
      suppressing Msh3 and Mlh1 by CRISPR/Cas9 targeting diminished the CAG repeat 
      expansion. These findings suggest that nuclear TDP-43 deficiency may dysregulate 
      the expression of DNA mismatch repair genes, leading to CAG repeat expansion and 
      contributing to the pathogenesis of CAG repeat diseases.

TI  - Toxicity of copper and zinc alone and in combination in Caenorhabditis elegans 
      model of Huntington's disease and protective effects of rutin.

AB  - Copper (Cu) and Zinc (Zn) are required in small concentrations for metabolic 
      functions, but are also toxic. There is a great concern about soil pollution by 
      heavy metals, which may exposure the population to these toxicants, either by 
      inhalation of dust or exposure to toxicants through ingestion of food derived 
      from contaminated soils. In addition, the toxicity of metals in combination is 
      questionable, as soil quality guidelines only assess them separately. It is well 
      known that metal accumulation is often found in the pathologically affected 
      regions of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD). 
      HD is caused by an autosomal dominantly inherited CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. This results in the formation of a mutant 
      huntingtin (mHTT) protein with an abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat. 
      The pathology of HD results in loss of neuronal cells, motor changes, and 
      dementia. Rutin is a flavonoid found in various food sources, and previous 
      studies indicate it has protective effects in HD models and acts as a metal 
      chelator. However, further studies are needed to unravel its effects on metal 
      dyshomeostasis and to discern the underlying mechanisms. In the present study, we 
      investigated the toxic effects of long-term exposure to copper, zinc, and their 
      mixture, and the relationship with the progression of neurotoxicity and 
      neurodegeneration in a C. elegans-based HD model. Furthermore, we investigated 
      the effects of rutin post metal exposure. Overall, we demonstrate that chronic 
      exposure to the metals and their mixture altered body parameters, locomotion, and 
      developmental delay, in addition to increasing polyQ protein aggregates in 
      muscles and neurons causing neurodegeneration. We also propose that rutin has 
      protective effects acting through mechanisms involving antioxidant and chelating 
      properties. Altogether, our data provides new indications about the higher 
      toxicity of metals in combination, the chelating potential of rutin in the C. 
      elegans model of HD and possible strategies for future treatments of 
      neurodegenerative diseases caused by the aggregation of proteins related to 
      metals.

TI  - Huntington's Disease with Small CAG Repeat Expansions.
PG  - 1294-1306

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carriers of small cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats below 39 in 
      the HTT gene are traditionally associated with milder Huntington's disease, but 
      their clinical profile has not been extensively studied. OBJECTIVE: To study the 
      phenotype of CAG(36-38) repeat carriers. METHODS: We included 35 patients and 
      premanifest carriers of CAG(36-38) repeats. We compared clinical and 
      neuropsychological profiles of 11 CAG(36-38) patients with 11 matched CAG(40-42) 
      patients. In addition, we analyzed 243 CAG(36-38) individuals from the ENROLL 
      study to complete the phenotype description. RESULTS: Global cognitive efficiency 
      and performance in different cognitive subdomains were similar in small 
      CAG(36-38) and typically CAG(40-42) expanded individuals. Chorea as the first 
      symptom was significantly less frequent for CAG(36-38) patients (P = 0.04) 
      despite similar total motor scores at first visit. Total motor score at last 
      visit was significantly lower in CAG(36-38) carriers (P = 0.003). The similar 
      cognitive and different motor profile of CAG(36-38) (n = 243) and CAG(40-42) 
      (n = 4675) carriers was confirmed in the ENROLL database. Additionally, 
      clinicians were significantly less confident in diagnosing Huntington's disease 
      (P = 2.4e-8) and diagnosis happened significantly later in CAG(36-38) 
      (P = 2.2e-6) despite a similar age at symptom onset (P = 0.29). CONCLUSIONS: We 
      showed that small CAG(36-38) expansion carriers had a similar cognitive profile 
      to those with the more common CAG(40-42) expansions. These individuals may evade 
      molecular diagnosis because of the absence of chorea rather than because of a low 
      penetrance of symptoms. This finding should encourage neurologists to consider 
      Huntington's disease in cognitively impaired elderly patients without typical 
      chorea and anticipate consequences for genetic counseling in their offspring. (c)

AB  - Long-read HiFi genome sequencing allows for accurate detection and direct phasing 
      of single nucleotide variants, indels, and structural variants. Recent 
      algorithmic development enables simultaneous detection of CpG methylation for 
      analysis of regulatory element activity directly in HiFi reads. We present a 
      comprehensive haplotype resolved 5-base HiFi genome sequencing dataset from a 
      rare disease cohort of 276 samples in 152 families to identify rare (~0.5%) 
      hypermethylation events. We find that 80% of these events are allele-specific and 
      predicted to cause loss of regulatory element activity. We demonstrate 
      heritability of extreme hypermethylation including rare cis variants associated 
      with short (~200 bp) and large hypermethylation events (>1 kb), respectively. We 
      identify repeat expansions in proximal promoters predicting allelic gene 
      silencing via hypermethylation and demonstrate allelic transcriptional events 
      downstream. On average 30-40 rare hypermethylation tiles overlap rare disease 
      genes per patient, providing indications for variation prioritization including a 
      previously undiagnosed pathogenic allele in DIP2B causing global developmental 
      delay. We propose that use of HiFi genome sequencing in unsolved rare disease 
      cases will allow detection of unconventional diseases alleles due to loss of 
      regulatory element activity.

TI  - Huntingtin Decreases Susceptibility to a Spontaneous Seizure Disorder in FVN/B 
      Mice.
PG  - 2249-2266
LID - 10.14336/AD.2023.0423 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder that is 
      caused by a trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene that codes for the 
      protein huntingtin (HTT in humans or Htt in mice). HTT is a multi-functional, 
      ubiquitously expressed protein that is essential for embryonic survival, normal 
      neurodevelopment, and adult brain function. The ability of wild-type HTT to 
      protect neurons against various forms of death raises the possibility that loss 
      of normal HTT function may worsen disease progression in HD. Huntingtin-lowering 
      therapeutics are being evaluated in clinical trials for HD, but concerns have 
      been raised that decreasing wild-type HTT levels may have adverse effects. Here 
      we show that Htt levels modulate the occurrence of an idiopathic seizure disorder 
      that spontaneously occurs in approximately 28% of FVB/N mice, which we have 
      called FVB/N Seizure Disorder with SUDEP (FSDS). These abnormal FVB/N mice 
      demonstrate the cardinal features of mouse models of epilepsy including 
      spontaneous seizures, astrocytosis, neuronal hypertrophy, upregulation of 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and sudden seizure-related death. 
      Interestingly, mice heterozygous for the targeted inactivation of Htt (Htt+/- 
      mice) exhibit an increased frequency of this disorder (71% FSDS phenotype), while 
      over-expression of either full length wild-type HTT in YAC18 mice or full length 
      mutant HTT in YAC128 mice completely prevents it (0% FSDS phenotype). Examination 
      of the mechanism underlying huntingtin's ability to modulate the frequency of 
      this seizure disorder indicated that over-expression of full length HTT can 
      promote neuronal survival following seizures. Overall, our results demonstrate a 
      protective role for huntingtin in this form of epilepsy and provide a plausible 
      explanation for the observation of seizures in the juvenile form of HD, 
      Lopes-Maciel-Rodan syndrome, and Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. Adverse effects caused 
      by decreasing huntingtin levels have ramifications for huntingtin-lowering 
      therapies that are being developed to treat HD.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder caused by the 
      expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat tract in the huntingtin gene. 
      Inheritance of expanded CAG repeats is needed for HD manifestation, but further 
      somatic expansion of the repeat tract in non-dividing cells, particularly 
      striatal neurons, hastens disease onset. Called somatic repeat expansion, this 
      process is mediated by the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. Among MMR components 
      identified as modifiers of HD onset, MutS homolog 3 (MSH3) has emerged as a 
      potentially safe and effective target for therapeutic intervention. Here, we 
      identify a fully chemically modified short interfering RNA (siRNA) that robustly 
      silences Msh3 in vitro and in vivo. When synthesized in a di-valent scaffold, 
      siRNA-mediated silencing of Msh3 effectively blocked CAG-repeat expansion in the 
      striatum of two HD mouse models without affecting tumor-associated microsatellite 
      instability or mRNA expression of other MMR genes. Our findings establish a 
      promising treatment approach for patients with HD and other repeat expansion 
      diseases.

AB  - Pathogenic short tandem repeat (STR) expansions cause over 20 neurodegenerative 
      diseases. To determine the contribution of STRs in sporadic amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), we used ExpansionHunter, 
      REviewer, and polymerase chain reaction validation to assess 21 neurodegenerative 
      disease-associated STRs in whole-genome sequencing data from 608 patients with 
      sporadic ALS, 68 patients with sporadic FTD, and 4703 matched controls. We also 
      propose a data-derived outlier detection method for defining allele thresholds in 
      rare STRs. Excluding C9orf72 repeat expansions, 17.6% of clinically diagnosed ALS 
      and FTD cases had at least one expanded STR allele reported to be pathogenic or 
      intermediate for another neurodegenerative disease. We identified and validated 
      162 disease-relevant STR expansions in C9orf72 (ALS/FTD), ATXN1 [spinal 
      cerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1)], ATXN2 (SCA2), ATXN8 (SCA8), TBP (SCA17), HTT 
      (Huntington's disease), DMPK [myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)], CNBP (DM2), and 
      FMR1 (fragile-X disorders). Our findings suggest clinical and pathological 
      pleiotropy of neurodegenerative disease genes and highlight their importance in 
      ALS and FTD.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin 
      (HTT) gene. CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease causes double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the 
      targeted DNA that induces toxicity, whereas CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) using 
      dead Cas9 (dCas9) suppresses the target gene expression without DSBs. Delivery of 
      dCas9-sgRNA targeting CAG repeat region does not damage the targeted DNA in 
      HEK293T cells containing CAG repeats. When this study investigates whether 
      CRISPRi can suppress mutant HTT (mHTT), CRISPRi results in reduced expression of 
      mHTT with relative preservation of the wild-type HTT in human HD fibroblasts. 
      Although both dCas9 and Cas9 treatments reduce mHTT by sgRNA targeting the CAG 
      repeat region, CRISPRi delays behavioral deterioration and protects striatal 
      neurons against cell death in HD mice. Collectively, CRISPRi can delay disease 
      progression by suppressing mHtt, suggesting DNA DSB-free CRISPRi is a potential 
      therapy for HD that can compensate for the shortcoming of CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a cytosine adenine guanine-repeat 
      expansion in the huntingtin gene. This results in the production of toxic mutant 
      huntingtin protein (mHTT), which has an elongated polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch 
      near the protein's N-terminal end. The pharmacological lowering of mHTT 
      expression in the brain targets the underlying driver of HD and is one of the 
      principal therapeutic strategies being pursued to slow or stop disease 
      progression. This report describes the characterisation and validation of an 
      assay designed to quantify mHTT in the cerebrospinal fluid of individuals with 
      HD, for use in registrational clinical trials. The assay was optimised, and its 
      performance was characterised with recombinant huntingtin protein (HTT) varying 
      in overall and polyQ-repeat length. The assay was successfully validated by two 
      independent laboratories in regulated bioanalytical environments and showed a 
      steep signal increase as the polyQ stretch of recombinant HTTs pivoted from 
      wild-type to mutant protein forms. Linear mixed effects modelling confirmed 
      highly parallel concentration-response curves for HTTs, with only a minor impact 
      of individual slopes of the concentration-response for different HTTs 
      (typically < 5% of the overall slope). This implies an equivalent quantitative 
      signal behaviour for HTTs with differing polyQ-repeat lengths. The reported 
      method may be a reliable biomarker tool with relevance across the spectrum of HD 
      mutations, which can facilitate the clinical development of HTT-lowering 
      therapies in HD.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. The resulting polyglutamine (polyQ) tract 
      alters the function of the HTT protein. Although HTT is expressed in different 
      tissues, the medium-spiny projection neurons (MSNs) in the striatum are 
      particularly vulnerable in HD. Thus, we sought to define the proteome of human HD 
      patient-derived MSNs. We differentiated HD72-induced pluripotent stem cells and 
      isogenic controls into MSNs and carried out quantitative proteomic analysis. 
      Using data-dependent acquisitions with FAIMS for label-free quantification on the 
      Orbitrap Lumos mass spectrometer, we identified 6323 proteins with at least two 
      unique peptides. Of these, 901 proteins were altered significantly more in the 
      HD72-MSNs than in isogenic controls. Functional enrichment analysis of 
      upregulated proteins demonstrated extracellular matrix and DNA signaling (DNA 
      replication pathway, double-strand break repair, G1/S transition) with the 
      highest significance. Conversely, processes associated with the downregulated 
      proteins included neurogenesis-axogenesis, the brain-derived neurotrophic 
      factor-signaling pathway, Ephrin-A:EphA pathway, regulation of synaptic 
      plasticity, triglyceride homeostasis cholesterol, plasmid lipoprotein particle 
      immune response, interferon-gamma signaling, immune system major histocompatibility 
      complex, lipid metabolism, and cellular response to stimulus. Moreover, proteins 
      involved in the formation and maintenance of axons, dendrites, and synapses 
      (e.g., septin protein members) were dysregulated in HD72-MSNs. Importantly, lipid 
      metabolism pathways were altered, and using quantitative image analysis, we found 
      that lipid droplets accumulated in the HD72-MSN, suggesting a deficit in the 
      turnover of lipids possibly through lipophagy. Our proteomics analysis of 
      HD72-MSNs identified relevant pathways that are altered in MSNs and confirm 
      current and new therapeutic targets for HD.

AB  - Over a third of the human genome is comprised of repetitive sequences, including 
      more than a million short tandem repeats (STRs). While studies of the pathologic 
      consequences of repeat expansions that cause syndromic human diseases are 
      extensive, the potential native functions of STRs are often ignored. Here, we 
      summarize a growing body of research into the normal biological functions for 
      repetitive elements across the genome, with a particular focus on the roles of 
      STRs in regulating gene expression. We propose reconceptualizing the pathogenic 
      consequences of repeat expansions as aberrancies in normal gene regulation. From 
      this altered viewpoint, we predict that future work will reveal broader roles for 
      STRs in neuronal function and as risk alleles for more common human neurological 
      diseases.

TI  - Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis of Shared Genes, miRNA, Biological Pathways 
      and Their Potential Role as Therapeutic Targets in Huntington's Disease Stages.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24054873 [doi]
LID - 4873
AB  - Huntington's Disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by 
      CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT). The HTT gene was the first 
      disease-associated gene mapped to a chromosome, but the pathophysiological 
      mechanisms, genes, proteins or miRNAs involved in HD remain poorly understood. 
      Systems bioinformatics approaches can divulge the synergistic relationships of 
      multiple omics data and their integration, and thus provide a holistic approach 
      to understanding diseases. The purpose of this study was to identify the 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs), HD-related gene targets, pathways and 
      miRNAs in HD and, more specifically, between the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic 
      HD stages. Three publicly available HD datasets were analysed to obtain DEGs for 
      each HD stage from each dataset. In addition, three databases were used to obtain 
      HD-related gene targets. The shared gene targets between the three public 
      databases were compared, and clustering analysis was performed on the common 
      shared genes. Enrichment analysis was performed on (i) DEGs identified for each 
      HD stage in each dataset, (ii) gene targets from the public databases and (iii) 
      the clustering analysis results. Furthermore, the hub genes shared between the 
      public databases and the HD DEGs were identified, and topological network 
      parameters were applied. Identification of HD-related miRNAs and their gene 
      targets was obtained, and a miRNA-gene network was constructed. Enriched pathways 
      identified for the 128 common genes revealed pathways linked to multiple 
      neurodegeneration diseases (HD, Parkinson's disease, Spinocerebellar ataxia), 
      MAPK and HIF-1 signalling pathways. Eighteen HD-related hub genes were identified 
      based on network topological analysis of MCC, degree and closeness. The 
      highest-ranked genes were FoxO3 and CASP3, CASP3 and MAP2 were found for 
      betweenness and eccentricity and CREBBP and PPARGC1A were identified for the 
      clustering coefficient. The miRNA-gene network identified eleven miRNAs 
      (mir-19a-3p, mir-34b-3p, mir-128-5p, mir-196a-5p, mir-34a-5p, mir-338-3p, 
      mir-23a-3p and mir-214-3p) and eight genes (ITPR1, CASP3, GRIN2A, FoxO3, TGM2, 
      CREBBP, MTHFR and PPARGC1A). Our work revealed that various biological pathways 
      seem to be involved in HD either during the pre-symptomatic or symptomatic stages 
      of HD. This may offer some clues for the molecular mechanisms, pathways and 
      cellular components underlying HD and how these may act as potential therapeutic 
      targets for HD.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited intellectual disability. 
      FXS is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region 
      of the FMR1 gene, which leads to gene methylation, transcriptional silencing, and 
      lack of expression of Fragile X Messenger Riboprotein (FMRP). Currently available 
      FXS therapies are inefficient, and the disease severity is highly variable, 
      making it difficult to predict disease trajectory and treatment response. We and 
      others have recently shown that a subset of full-mutation, fully-methylated 
      (FM-FM) males with FXS express low amounts of FMRP which could contribute to 
      phenotypic variability. To better understand the underlying mechanisms, we 
      developed a sensitive qRT-PCR assay to detect FMR1 mRNA in blood. This assay 
      reproducibly detects trace amounts of FMR1 mRNA in a subset of FM-FM males, 
      suggesting that current Southern Blot and PCR determination of FM-FM status is 
      not always associated with complete transcriptional silencing. The functional 
      relevance of trace-level FMR1 mRNA is confirmed by showing a positive correlation 
      with cognitive function; however, phenotypic variability is not fully explained 
      by FMR1 expression. These results corroborate the need for better molecular 
      assays for FXS diagnosis and encourage studies to elucidate the factors 
      contributing to the phenotypic variability of FXS.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive inherited neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene, which is translated into 
      the pathologic mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein. Despite the great potential of 
      HTT lowering strategies and the numerous antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) in 
      pre- and clinical trials, sustained silencing of mHTT has not been achieved. As a 
      strategy to improve ASO delivery, cyclodextrin-based nanoparticles (CDs) offer a 
      promising approach. Here, three CDs with distinct chemical structures were 
      designed and their efficacies were compared as potential platforms for the 
      delivery of ASO targeting HTT. Results using striatal neurons and HD 
      patient-derived fibroblasts indicate that modified gamma-CDs exhibited the best 
      uptake efficiency and successfully downregulated mHTT at protein and allele 
      levels. The incorporation of the brain-targeting peptide RVG into the modified 
      gamma-CDs showed greater downregulation of mHTT protein and HD-causing allele SNP1 
      than untargeted ones in an in vitro blood-brain barrier model. Although the ASO 
      sequence was designed as a nonallele-specific therapeutic approach, our strategy 
      gives an additional benefit of some mHTT selectivity. Overall, this study 
      demonstrated the CD platform's feasibility for delivering ASO-based therapeutics 
      for HD treatment.

AB  - Introduction: Huntington disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder which is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene that codes for 
      an elongated polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin (HTT) protein. Huntingtin is 
      subjected to multiple post-translational modifications which regulate its 
      cellular functions and degradation. We have previously identified a 
      palmitoylation site at cysteine 214 (C214), catalyzed by the enzymes ZDHHC17 and 
      ZDHHC13. Reduced palmitoylation level of mutant huntingtin is linked to toxicity 
      and loss of function. Moreover, we have described N-terminal myristoylation by 
      the N-myristoyltransferases of a short fragment of huntingtin (HTT553-586) at 
      glycine 553 (G553) following proteolysis at aspartate 552 (D552). Results: Here, 
      we show that huntingtin is palmitoylated at numerous cysteines: C105, C433, C3134 
      and C3144. In addition, we confirm that full-length huntingtin is cleaved at D552 
      and post-translationally myristoylated at G553. Importantly, blocking caspase 
      cleavage at the critical and pathogenic aspartate 586 (D586) significantly 
      increases posttranslational myristoylation of huntingtin. In turn, myristoylation 
      of huntingtin promotes the co-interaction between C-terminal and N-terminal 
      huntingtin fragments, which is also protective. Discussion: This suggests that 
      the protective effect of inhibiting caspase-cleavage at D586 may be mediated 
      through post-translational myristoylation of huntingtin at G553.

TI  - Fast and reliable detection of repeat expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia using 
      exomes.

AB  - Usually, molecular diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia is based on a step-by-step 
      approach with targeted sizing of four repeat expansions accounting for most 
      dominant cases, then targeted sequencing of other genes. Nowadays, genome 
      sequencing allows detection of most pathogenic variants in a single step. The 
      ExpansionHunter tool can detect expansions in short-read genome sequencing data. 
      Recent studies have shown that ExpansionHunter can also be used to identify 
      repeat expansions in exome sequencing data. We tested ExpansionHunter on 
      spinocerebellar ataxia exomes in a research context as a second-line analysis, 
      after exclusion of main CAG repeat expansions in half of the probands. First, we 
      confirmed the detection of expansions in seven known expansion carriers and then, 
      after targeted analysis of ATXN1, 2, 3 and 7, CACNA1A, TBP, ATN1, NOP56, AR and 
      HTT in 498 exomes, we found 22 additional pathogenic expansions. Comparison with 
      capillary migration sizing in 247 individuals and confirmation of all expanded 
      alleles detected by ExpansionHunter demonstrated that for these loci, sensitivity 
      and specificity reached 100%. ExpansionHunter detected but underestimated the 
      repeat size for larger expansions, and the normal alleles distribution at each 
      locus should be taken into account to detect expansions. Exome combined with 
      ExpansionHunter is reliable to detect repeat expansions in selected loci as 
      first-line analysis in spinocerebellar ataxia.

TI  - Reduced-penetrance Huntington's disease-causing alleles with 39 CAG trinucleotide 
      repeats could be a genetic factor of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
PG  - 47-51

AB  - BACKGROUND: Expanded HTT alleles with 40 or more CAG repeats were recently found 
      to be a rare cause of frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (ALS) spectrum diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of HTT 
      repeat expansions in a Taiwanese cohort with ALS. METHODS: We analyzed the 
      numbers of CAG repeats in exon 1 of HTT in a cohort of 410 Taiwanese patients 
      with ALS and 1514 control individuals by utilizing polymerase chain reaction and 
      amplicon fragment length analysis. RESULTS: Only one of the 410 ALS patients 
      carried a reduced-penetrance HD-causing allele with 39 CAG repeats, and none had 
      an expanded HTT CAG repeats >/=40. The patient presented with rapidly progressive 
      bulbar-onset ALS with disease onset at the age of 64 years. He had neither chorea 
      nor cognitive impairment. He had a family history of chorea, but no other family 
      member manifested with ALS. None of the 1514 control individuals carried an HTT 
      expanded allele with CAG repeats larger than 37 repeats. CONCLUSION: The HTT 
      allele with 39 CAG repeats could be a genetic factor linked to ALS 
      susceptibility.

AB  - Mutant messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein contribute to the clinical manifestation 
      of many repeat-associated neurological disorders, with the presence of nuclear 
      RNA clusters being a common pathological feature. Yet, investigations into 
      Huntington's disease-caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin 
      (HTT) gene-have primarily focused on toxic protein gain-of-function as the 
      primary disease-causing feature. To date, mutant HTT mRNA has not been identified 
      as an in vivo hallmark of Huntington's disease. Here, we report that, in two 
      Huntington's disease mouse models (YAC128 and BACHD-97Q-DeltaN17), mutant HTT mRNA is 
      retained in the nucleus. Widespread formation of large mRNA clusters 
      ( approximately 0.6-5 microm(3)) occurred in 50-75% of striatal and cortical neurons. Cluster 
      formation was independent of age and driven by expanded repeats. Clusters 
      associate with chromosomal transcriptional sites and quantitatively co-localize 
      with the aberrantly processed N-terminal exon 1-intron 1 mRNA isoform, HTT1a. 
      HTT1a mRNA clusters are observed in a subset of neurons from human Huntington's 
      disease post-mortem brain and are likely caused by somatic expansion of repeats. 
      In YAC128 mice, clusters, but not individual HTT mRNA, are resistant to antisense 
      oligonucleotide treatment. Our findings identify mutant HTT/HTT1a mRNA clustering 
      as an early, robust molecular signature of Huntington's disease, providing in 
      vivo evidence that Huntington's disease is a repeat expansion disease with mRNA 
      involvement.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by an 
      autosomal dominant trinucleotide (CAG) tandem repeat, resulting in complex motor, 
      psychiatric and cognitive symptoms as well as gastrointestinal disturbances and 
      other peripheral symptoms. There are currently no disease-modifying treatments, 
      and the peripheral pathology of the disorder is not well understood. Emerging 
      evidence suggests that the bi-directional communication pathways between the gut 
      and the brain, including the microbiota-gut-brain axis, can affect motor, 
      psychiatric and cognitive symptoms as well as weight loss and sexual dimorphism 
      seen in HD. Furthermore, both HD and the microbiota-gut-brain axis can be 
      influenced by environmental factors, opening potential new avenues to explore 
      therapeutic options for this devastating disorder.

TI  - Expression of expanded GGC repeats within NOTCH2NLC causes behavioral deficits 
      and neurodegeneration in a mouse model of neuronal intranuclear inclusion 
      disease.

AB  - GGC repeat expansions within NOTCH2NLC have been identified as the genetic cause 
      of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). To understand the molecular 
      pathogenesis of NIID, here, we established both a transgenic mouse model and a 
      human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) model. Expression of the NOTCH2NLC with 
      expanded GGC repeats produced widespread intranuclear and perinuclear polyglycine 
      (polyG), polyalanine (polyA), and polyarginine (polyR) inclusions, leading to 
      behavioral deficits and severe neurodegeneration, which faithfully mimicked the 
      clinical and pathological features associated with NIID. Furthermore, conserved 
      alternative splicing events were identified between the NIID mouse and hNPC 
      models, among which was the enrichment of the binding motifs of hnRNPM, an RNA 
      binding protein known as alternative splicing regulator. Expanded NOTCH2NLC-polyG 
      and NOTCH2NLC-polyA could interact with and sequester hnRNPM, while 
      overexpression of hnRNPM could ameliorate the cellular toxicity. These results 
      together suggested that dysfunction of hnRNPM could play an important role in the 
      molecular pathogenesis of NIID.

TI  - Complexities in Genetic Counseling and Testing of Huntington's Disease: A 
      Perspective from India.
PG  - 2141-2144
LID - 10.4103/0028-3886.359184 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, progressive 
      neuropsychiatric illness caused by CAG repeat expansion. The high penetrance of 
      the mutation and limited treatment options make it challenging for patients and 
      caretakers. Proper counseling enables families to cope better and make informed 
      life choices. OBJECTIVE: To explore some complex issues in genetic counseling and 
      testing (GCAT) in HD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vignettes of patients who underwent 
      genetic testing along with pre and post-test counseling at our GCAT clinic. 
      RESULTS: Case 1: Diagnosis of juvenile HD meant that the healthy parent was an 
      obligate carrier of the mutation. Case 2: Consanguinity resulted in a dense 
      prevalence of HD and >50% risk for the progeny. Case 3: Predictive testing in 
      youth with healthy parents but affected uncles and aunts revealed a HD expansion. 
      CONCLUSIONS: HD can present with complex inheritance patterns and proper 
      counseling is necessary for better outcomes.

AB  - Variability in neurodegenerative disease progression poses great challenges for 
      the evaluation of potential treatments. Identifying the persons who will 
      experience significant progression in the short term is key for the 
      implementation of trials with smaller sample sizes. We apply here disease course 
      mapping to forecast biomarker progression for individual carriers of the 
      pathological CAG repeat expansions responsible for Huntington disease. We used 
      data from two longitudinal studies (TRACK-HD and TRACK-ON) to synchronize 
      temporal progression of 15 clinical and imaging biomarkers from 290 participants 
      with Huntington disease. We used then the resulting HD COURSE MAP to forecast 
      clinical endpoints from the baseline data of 11,510 participants from ENROLL-HD, 
      an external validation cohort. We used such forecasts to select participants at 
      risk for progression and compute the power of trials for such an enriched 
      population. HD COURSE MAP forecasts biomarkers 5 years after the baseline 
      measures with a maximum mean absolute error of 10 points for the total motor 
      score and 2.15 for the total functional capacity. This allowed reducing sample 
      sizes in trial up to 50% including participants with a higher risk for 
      progression ensuring a more homogeneous group of participants.

AB  - Haplotyping individual full-length transcripts can be important in diagnosis and 
      treatment of certain genetic diseases. One set of diseases, repeat expansions of 
      simple tandem repeat sequences are the cause of over 40 neurological disorders. 
      In many of these conditions, expanding a polymorphic repeat beyond a given 
      threshold has been strongly associated with disease onset and severity. Given 
      that most repeat expansions are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, 
      repeat expansion disorders are typically characterized by a heterozygous 
      expansion locus associated with a single haplotype. Precision genetic medicines 
      can be used to selectively target expansion-containing sequences in a 
      haplotype-specific manner.However, repeat expansion lengths often exceed the 
      capacity of next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads. Therefore, the accurate 
      length and haplotype determination of repeat expansions requires special 
      considerations and requires the development of custom methods. Here we highlight 
      a method for targeted haplotype phasing of the HTT gene, which can be adopted for 
      use with other full-length transcripts and in other repeat expansion disorders.

AB  - HTT full-penetrance pathogenic repeat expansions, the genetic cause of 
      Huntington's disease (HD), have been recently reported in a minority of 
      frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients (0.13%). We 
      analyzed HTT CAG repeats in an Italian cohort of ALS patients (n = 467) by 
      repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction. One patient harbored two expanded 
      alleles in the HTT gene (42 and 37 CAG repeats). The absence of HD typical 
      symptoms and the clinical picture consistent with ALS, corroborated by the 
      diagnostic assessment, apparently excluded a misdiagnosis of HD.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions in exon-1 of huntingtin (HTT). 
      Currently, there is no cure for HD, and the clinical care of individuals with HD 
      is focused on symptom management. Previously, we showed allele-specific deletion 
      of the expanded HTT allele (mHTT) using CRISPR-Cas9 by targeting nearby (<10 kb) 
      SNPs that created or eliminated a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) near exon-1. 
      Here, we comprehensively analyzed all potential PAM sites within a 10.4-kb 
      genomic region flanking exon-1 of HTT in 983 individuals with HD using a 
      multiplex targeted long-read sequencing approach on the Oxford Nanopore platform. 
      We developed computational tools (NanoBinner and NanoRepeat) to de-multiplex the 
      data, detect repeats, and phase the reads on the expanded or the wild-type HTT 
      allele. One SNP common to 30% of individuals with HD of European ancestry emerged 
      through this analysis, which was confirmed as a strong candidate for 
      allele-specific deletion of the mHTT in human HD cell lines. In addition, up to 
      57% HD individuals may be candidates for allele-specific editing through 
      combinatorial SNP targeting. Cumulatively, we provide a haplotype map of the 
      region surrounding exon-1 of HTT in individuals affected with HD. Our workflow 
      can be applied to other repeat expansion diseases to facilitate the design of 
      guide RNAs for allele-specific gene editing.

AB  - The C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion is an established cause of 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and has 
      also been associated with Huntington disease (HD)-like syndromes and rarely with 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study we 
      aimed to investigate the genotypic and phenotypic profile of C9ORF72-related 
      disorders in Greece. For this reason, 957 patients (467 with ALS, 53 with HD-like 
      syndromes, 247 with dementia, 175 with PD and 15 with hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia, HSP) and 321 controls were tested for the C9ORF72 repeat expansion. 
      Forty-nine patients with ALS (10.5%), 2 with HD-like syndromes (3.8%), 13 with 
      FTD (11.5%), 1 with AD (1.6%), and 2 with PD (1.1%) were expansion-positive. The 
      expansion was not detected in the HSP or control groups. The results of this 
      study provide an update on the spectrum of C9ORF72-related neurodegenerative 
      diseases, emphasizing the importance of C9ORF72 genetic testing in Greek patients 
      with familial and sporadic ALS and/or FTD and HD-like syndromes.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation in the 
      gene encoding the huntingtin (Htt) protein, with mutant Htt protein subsequently 
      forming aggregates within the brain. Mutant Htt is a current target for novel 
      therapeutic strategies for HD, however, the lack of translation from preclinical 
      research to disease-modifying treatments highlights the need to improve our 
      understanding of the role of Htt protein in the human brain. This study aims to 
      undertake an immunohistochemical screen of 12 candidate antibodies against 
      various sequences along the Htt protein to characterize Htt distribution and 
      expression in post-mortem human brain tissue microarrays (TMAs). 
      Immunohistochemistry was performed on middle temporal gyrus TMAs comprising of up 
      to 28 HD and 27 age-matched control cases, using 12 antibodies specific to 
      various sequences along the Htt protein. From this study, six antibodies directed 
      to the Htt N-terminus successfully immunolabeled human brain tissue. Htt 
      aggregates and Htt protein expression levels for the six successful antibodies 
      were subsequently quantified with a customized automated image analysis pipeline 
      on the TMAs. A 2.5-12 fold increase in the number of Htt aggregates were detected 
      in HD cases using antibodies MAB5374, MW1, and EPR5526, despite no change in 
      overall Htt protein expression compared to control cases, suggesting a 
      redistribution of Htt into aggregates in HD. MAB5374, MW1, and EPR5526 Htt 
      aggregate numbers were positively correlated with CAG repeat length, and 
      negatively correlated with the age of symptom onset in HD. However, the number of 
      Htt aggregates did not correlate with the degree of striatal degeneration or the 
      degree of cortical neuron loss. Together, these results suggest that longer CAG 
      repeat lengths correlate with Htt aggregation in the HD human brain, and greater 
      Htt cortical aggregate deposition is associated with an earlier age of symptom 
      onset in HD. This study also reinforces that antibodies MAB5492, MW8, and 2B7 
      which have been utilized to characterize Htt in animal models of HD do not 
      specifically immunolabel Htt aggregates in HD human brain tissue exclusively, 
      thereby highlighting the need for validated means of Htt detection to support 
      drug development for HD.

TI  - Developing HDAC4-Selective Protein Degraders To Investigate the Role of HDAC4 in 
      Huntington's Disease Pathology.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a lethal autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder resulting from a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. The 
      product of translation of this gene is a highly aggregation-prone protein 
      containing a polyglutamine tract >35 repeats (mHTT) that has been shown to 
      colocalize with histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) in cytoplasmic inclusions in HD 
      mouse models. Genetic reduction of HDAC4 in an HD mouse model resulted in delayed 
      aggregation of mHTT, along with amelioration of neurological phenotypes and 
      extended lifespan. To further investigate the role of HDAC4 in cellular models of 
      HD, we have developed bifunctional degraders of the protein and report the first 
      potent and selective degraders of HDAC4 that show an effect in multiple cell 
      lines, including HD mouse model-derived cortical neurons. These degraders act via 
      the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway and selectively degrade HDAC4 over other class 
      IIa HDAC isoforms (HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9).

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. HTT is 
      involved in the axonal transport of vesicles containing brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In HD, diminished BDNF transport leads to reduced 
      BDNF delivery to the striatum, contributing to striatal and cortical neuronal 
      death. Pridopidine is a selective and potent sigma-1 receptor (S1R) agonist 
      currently in clinical development for HD. The S1R is located at the endoplasmic 
      reticulum (ER)-mitochondria interface, where it regulates key cellular pathways 
      commonly impaired in neurodegenerative diseases. We used a microfluidic device 
      that reconstitutes the corticostriatal network, allowing the investigation of 
      presynaptic dynamics, synaptic morphology and transmission, and postsynaptic 
      signaling. Culturing primary neurons from the HD mouse model Hdh(CAG140/+) 
      provides a "disease-on-a-chip" platform ideal for investigating pathogenic 
      mechanisms and drug activity. Pridopidine rescued the trafficking of BDNF and 
      TrkB resulting in an increased neurotrophin signaling at the synapse. This 
      increased the capacity of HD neurons to release glutamate and restored 
      homeostasis at the corticostriatal synapse. These data suggest that pridopidine 
      enhances the availability of corticostriatal BDNF via S1R activation, leading to 
      neuroprotective effects.

TI  - Suppression of trinucleotide repeat expansion in spermatogenic cells in 
      Huntington's disease.
PG  - 2413-2430
LID - 10.1007/s10815-022-02594-x [doi]
AB  - Trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) are dispersed throughout the human genome. About 20 
      loci are related to human diseases, such as Huntington's disease (HD). A larger 
      TNR instability is predominantly observed in the paternal germ cells in some TNR 
      disorders. Suppressing the expansion during spermatogenesis can provide a unique 
      opportunity to end the vicious cycle of genetic anticipation. Here, using an in 
      vitro differentiation method to derive advanced spermatogenic cells, we 
      investigated the efficacy of two therapeutic agents, araC (cytarabine) and 
      aspirin, on stabilizing TNRs in spermatogenic cells. Two WT patient-derived 
      induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines and two HD hiPSC lines, with 44 Q and 
      180 Q, were differentiated into spermatogonial stem cell-like cells (SSCLCs). 
      Both HD cell lines showed CAG tract expansion in SSCLC. When treated with araC 
      and aspirin, HD1 showed moderate but not statistically significant stabilization 
      of TNR. In HD2, 10 nM of aspirin and araC showed significant stabilization of 
      TNR. All cell lines showed increased DNA damage response (DDR) gene expression in 
      SSCLCs while more genes were significantly induced in HD SSCLC. In HD1, araC and 
      aspirin treatment showed general suppression of DNA damage response genes. In 
      HD2, only FAN1, OGG1, and PCNA showed significant suppression. When the 
      methylation profile of HD cells was analyzed, FAN1 and OGG1 showed significant 
      hypermethylation after the aspirin and araC treatment in SSCLC compared to the 
      control. This study underscores the utility of our in vitro spermatogenesis model 
      to study and develop therapies for TNR disorders such as HD.

AB  - Huntington's disease is caused by an expanded CAG tract in HTT. The length of the 
      CAG tract accounts for over half the variance in age at onset of disease, and is 
      influenced by other genetic factors, mostly implicating the DNA maintenance 
      machinery. We examined a single nucleotide variant, rs79727797, on chromosome 5 
      in the TCERG1 gene, previously reported to be associated with Huntington's 
      disease and a quasi-tandem repeat (QTR) hexamer in exon 4 of TCERG1 with a 
      central pure repeat. We developed a method for calling perfect and imperfect 
      repeats from exome-sequencing data, and tested association between the QTR in 
      TCERG1 and residual age at motor onset (after correcting for the effects of CAG 
      length in the HTT gene) in 610 individuals with Huntington's disease via 
      regression analysis. We found a significant association between age at onset and 
      the sum of the repeat lengths from both alleles of the QTR (p = 2.1 x 10(-9)), 
      with each added repeat hexamer reducing age at onset by one year (95% confidence 
      interval [0.7, 1.4]). This association explained that previously observed with 
      rs79727797. The association with age at onset in the genome-wide association 
      study is due to a QTR hexamer in TCERG1, translated to a glutamine/alanine tract 
      in the protein. We could not distinguish whether this was due to cis-effects of 
      the hexamer repeat on gene expression or of the encoded glutamine/alanine tract 
      in the protein. These results motivate further study of the mechanisms by which 
      TCERG1 modifies onset of HD.

TI  - CAG Repeat Instability in the Peripheral and Central Nervous System of Transgenic 
      Huntington's Disease Monkeys.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10081863 [doi]
LID - 1863
AB  - Huntington's Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disease that results in severe 
      neurodegeneration with no cure. HD is caused by the expanded CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat (TNR) on the Huntingtin gene (HTT). Although the somatic and germline 
      expansion of the CAG repeats has been well-documented, the underlying mechanisms 
      had not been fully delineated. Increased CAG repeat length is associated with a 
      more severe phenotype, greater TNR instability, and earlier age of onset. The 
      direct relationship between CAG repeat length and molecular pathogenesis makes 
      TNR instability a useful measure of symptom severity and tissue susceptibility. 
      Thus, we examined the tissue-specific TNR instability of transgenic nonhuman 
      primate models of Huntington's disease. Our data show a similar profile of CAG 
      repeat expansion in both rHD1 and rHD7, where high instability was observed in 
      testis, liver, caudate, and putamen. CAG repeat expansion was observed in all 
      tissue samples, and tissue- and CAG repeat size-dependent expansion was observed. 
      Correlation analysis of CAG repeat expansion and the gene expression profile of 
      four genes in different tissues, clusterin (CLU), transferrin (TF), ribosomal 
      protein lateral stalk subunit P1 (RPLP1), and ribosomal protein L13a (RPL13A), 
      showed a strong correlation with CAG repeat instability. Overall, our data, along 
      with previously published studies, can be used for studying the biology of CAG 
      repeat instability and identifying new therapeutic targets.

      Subset of MicroRNAs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by 
      CAG-repeat expansions (>36) in exon 1 of HTT, which dysregulates multiple 
      cellular machineries. Translin-associated protein X (TRAX) is a scaffold protein 
      with diverse functions, including suppressing the microRNA (miRNA)-mediated 
      silencing by degrading pre-miRNA. To date, the role of TRAX in neurodegenerative 
      diseases remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: We delineated the role of TRAX upregulation 
      during HD progression. METHODS: Expression of TRAX in the brains of humans and 
      three mouse models with HD were analyzed by immunohistochemistry staining, 
      western blot, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. 
      Adeno-associated viruses harboring TRAX short hairpin RNA were intrastriatally 
      injected into HD mice to downregulate TRAX. HD-like symptoms were analyzed by 
      behavioral and biochemical assessments. The miRNA-sequencing and RNA-sequencing 
      analyses were used to identify the TRAX- regulated miRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) 
      axis during HD progression. The identified gene targets were validated 
      biochemically in mouse and human striatal cells. RESULTS: We discovered that TRAX 
      was upregulated in the brains of HD patients and three HD mouse models. 
      Downregulation of TRAX enhanced 83 miRNAs (including miR-330-3p, miR-496a-3p) and 
      subsequently changed the corresponding mRNA networks critical for HD pathogenesis 
      (eg, DARPP-32 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor). Disruption of the 
      TRAX-mediated miRNA-mRNA axis accelerated the progression of HD-like symptoms, 
      including the degeneration of motor function, accumulation of mHTT aggregates, 
      and shortened neurite outgrowth. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that TRAX 
      upregulation is authentic and protective in HD. Our study provides a novel layer 
      of regulation for HD pathogenesis and may lead to the development of new 
      therapeutic strategies for HD. (c) 2022 International Parkinson and Movement

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a monogenic disease that results in a combination of 
      motor, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms. It is caused by a CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which results in the 
      production of a mutant HTT protein (mHTT) with an extended polyglutamine tract 
      (PolyQ). Severe motor symptoms are a hallmark of HD and typically appear during 
      middle age; however, mild cognitive and personality changes often occur already 
      during early adolescence. Wild-type HTT is a regulator of synaptic functions and 
      plays a role in axon guidance, neurotransmitter release, and synaptic vesicle 
      trafficking. These functions are important for proper synapse assembly during 
      neuronal network formation. In the present study, we assessed the effect of mHTT 
      exon1 isoform on the synaptic and functional maturation of human induced 
      pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons. We used a relatively fast-maturing 
      hiPSC line carrying a doxycycline-inducible pro-neuronal transcription factor, 
      (iNGN2), and generated a double transgenic line by introducing only the exon 1 of 
      HTT, which carries the mutant CAG (mHTTEx1). The characterization of our cell 
      lines revealed that the presence of mHTTEx1 in hiPSC-derived neurons alters the 
      synaptic protein appearance, decreases synaptic contacts, and causes a delay in 
      the development of a mature neuronal activity pattern, recapitulating some of the 
      developmental alterations observed in HD models, nonetheless in a shorted time 
      window. Our data support the notion that HD has a neurodevelopmental component 
      and is not solely a degenerative disease.

      from the Mexican Mestizo Population.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are reports of different clinical statuses in carriers of 
      intermediate alleles (IAs) of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the HTT gene, from 
      individuals affected by a clinical picture indistinguishable from Huntington's 
      disease (HD) to those without manifestations. Therefore, the possible clinical 
      significance of these alleles has been widely debated. OBJECTIVES: The aim of 
      this study was to describe general and clinical features and discard HD 
      phenocopies by molecular assessment in a case series of IA carriers on the HTT 
      gene of a laboratory sample from a neurological center in Mexico. METHODS: We 
      selected individuals who had previously been tested for the HTT gene expansion, 
      which resulted in IAs. Clinical information was obtained from medical records, 
      and molecular analysis of the JPH3, PRNP, and TBP genes was performed only in IA 
      carriers with clinical manifestations. In addition, two patients with IA and 
      acanthocytes were evaluated by whole-exome sequencing. The scientific and ethical 
      committees of the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery Manuel Velasco 
      Suarez (NINNMVS) approved this study. RESULTS: From 1994 to 2019, the Genetics 
      Department of the NINNMVS confirmed 34 individuals with IAs, 15 of whom belonged 
      to 11 families with HD (IA-HD) and 19 of whom had no family history of HD 
      (IA-non-HD). We found a high proportion of manifestations of the HD phenotypic 
      spectrum in the IA-non-HD subgroup. In addition, among the 20 samples of IA 
      carriers with manifestations molecularly evaluated, we identified two unrelated 
      subjects with CAG/CTG repeat expansions on the JPH3 gene, confirming HD-like 2 
      (HDL2), and one patient with the homozygous pathogenic c.3232G>T variant 
      (p.Glu1078Ter) in the VPS13A gene, demonstrating choreoacanthocytosis. 
      DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Our results show the most extensive series of subjects 
      with IAs and clinical manifestations. In addition, we identify three HD 
      phenocopies, two HDL2 cases, and one choreoacanthocytosis case. Therefore, we 
      emphasize evaluating other HD phenocopies in IA carriers with clinical 
      manifestations whose family background is not associated with HD.

AB  - Earlier work has shown that siRNA-mediated reduction of the SUPT4H or SUPT5H 
      proteins, which interact to form the DSIF complex and facilitate transcript 
      elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), can decrease expression of mutant gene 
      alleles containing nucleotide repeat expansions differentially. Using 
      luminescence and fluorescence assays, we identified chemical compounds that 
      interfere with the SUPT4H-SUPT5H interaction and then investigated their effects 
      on synthesis of mRNA and protein encoded by mutant alleles containing repeat 
      expansions in the huntingtin gene (HTT), which causes the inherited 
      neurodegenerative disorder, Huntington's Disease (HD). Here we report that such 
      chemical interference can differentially affect expression of HTT mutant alleles, 
      and that a prototypical chemical, 6-azauridine (6-AZA), that targets the 
      SUPT4H-SUPT5H interaction can modify the biological response to mutant HTT gene 
      expression. Selective and dose-dependent effects of 6-AZA on expression of HTT 
      alleles containing nucleotide repeat expansions were seen in multiple types of 
      cells cultured in vitro, and in a Drosophila melanogaster animal model for HD. 
      Lowering of mutant HD protein and mitigation of the Drosophila "rough eye" 
      phenotype associated with degeneration of photoreceptor neurons in vivo were 
      observed. Our findings indicate that chemical interference with DSIF complex 
      formation can decrease biochemical and phenotypic effects of nucleotide repeat 
      expansions.

TI  - CGG repeats trigger translational frameshifts that generate aggregation-prone 
      chimeric proteins.
PG  - 8674-8689
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkac626 [doi]
AB  - CGG repeat expansions in the FMR1 5'UTR cause the neurodegenerative disease 
      Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). These repeats form stable 
      RNA secondary structures that support aberrant translation in the absence of an 
      AUG start codon (RAN translation), producing aggregate-prone peptides that 
      accumulate within intranuclear neuronal inclusions and contribute to 
      neurotoxicity. Here, we show that the most abundant RAN translation product, 
      FMRpolyG, is markedly less toxic when generated from a construct with a 
      non-repetitive alternating codon sequence in place of the CGG repeat. While 
      exploring the mechanism of this differential toxicity, we observed a +1 
      translational frameshift within the CGG repeat from the arginine to glycine 
      reading frame. Frameshifts occurred within the first few translated repeats and 
      were triggered predominantly by RNA sequence and structural features. Short 
      chimeric R/G peptides form aggregates distinct from those formed by either pure 
      arginine or glycine, and these chimeras induce toxicity in cultured rodent 
      neurons. Together, this work suggests that CGG repeats support translational 
      frameshifting and that chimeric RAN translated peptides may contribute to CGG 
      repeat-associated toxicity in FXTAS and related disorders.

PG  - 1841-1849
LID - 10.1002/mds.29153 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest a link between CAG repeat number in the HTT 
      gene and non-Huntington neurodegenerative diseases. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to 
      analyze whether expanded HTT CAG alleles and/or their size are associated with 
      the risk for developing alpha-synucleinopathies or their behavior as modulators of 
      the phenotype. METHODS: We genotyped the HTT gene CAG repeat number and APOE-E 
      isoforms in a case-control series including patients with either clinical or 
      neuropathological diagnosis of alpha-synucleinopathy. RESULTS: We identified three 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) patients (0.30%) and two healthy controls (0.19%) 
      carrying low-penetrance HTT repeat expansions whereas none of the dementia with 
      Lewy bodies (DLB) or multisystem atrophy (MSA) patients carried pathogenic HTT 
      expansions. In addition, a clear increase in the number of HTT CAG repeats was 
      found among DLB and PD groups influenced by the male gender and also by the APOE4 
      allele among DLB patients. HTT intermediate alleles' (IAs) distribution frequency 
      increased in the MSA group compared with controls (8.8% vs. 3.9%, respectively). 
      These differences were indeed statistically significant in the MSA group with 
      neuropathological confirmation. Two MSA HTT CAG IAs carriers with 32 HTT CAG 
      repeats showed isolated polyQ inclusions in pons and basal nuclei, which are two 
      critical structures in the neurodegeneration of MSA. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      point to a link between HTT CAG number, HTT IAs, and expanded HTT CAG repeats 
      with other non-HD brain pathology and support the hypothesis that they can share 
      common neurodegenerative pathways. (c) 2022 International Parkinson and Movement

      disease therapeutics.
PG  - 4409-4424
LID - 10.1093/brain/awac241 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the 
      huntingtin gene (HTT) that is translated into a polyglutamine stretch in the 
      huntingtin protein (HTT). We previously showed that HTT mRNA carrying an expanded 
      CAG repeat was incompletely spliced to generate HTT1a, an exon 1 only transcript, 
      which was translated to produce the highly aggregation-prone and pathogenic exon 
      1 HTT protein. This occurred in all knock-in mouse models of Huntington's disease 
      and could be detected in patient cell lines and post-mortem brains. To extend 
      these findings to a model system expressing human HTT, we took advantage of 
      YAC128 mice that are transgenic for a yeast artificial chromosome carrying human 
      HTT with an expanded CAG repeat. We discovered that the HTT1a transcript could be 
      detected throughout the brains of YAC128 mice. We implemented RNAscope to 
      visualize HTT transcripts at the single molecule level and found that full-length 
      HTT and HTT1a were retained together in large nuclear RNA clusters, as well as 
      being present as single transcripts in the cytoplasm. Homogeneous time-resolved 
      fluorescence analysis demonstrated that the HTT1a transcript had been translated 
      to produce the exon 1 HTT protein. The levels of exon 1 HTT in YAC128 mice, 
      correlated with HTT aggregation, supportive of the hypothesis that exon 1 HTT 
      initiates the aggregation process. Huntingtin-lowering strategies are a major 
      focus of therapeutic development for Huntington's disease. These approaches often 
      target full-length HTT alone and would not be expected to reduce pathogenic exon 
      1 HTT levels. We have established YAC128 mouse embryonic fibroblast lines and 
      shown that, together with our QuantiGene multiplex assay, these provide an 
      effective screening tool for agents that target HTT transcripts. The effects of 
      current targeting strategies on nuclear RNA clusters are unknown, structures that 
      may have a pathogenic role or alternatively could be protective by retaining 
      HTT1a in the nucleus and preventing it from being translated. In light of 
      recently halted antisense oligonucleotide trials, it is vital that agents 
      targeting HTT1a are developed, and that the effects of HTT-lowering strategies on 
      the subcellular levels of all HTT transcripts and their various HTT protein 
      isoforms are understood.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The expansion of a hexanucleotide GGGGCC repeat (G4C2) in the 
      C9orf72 locus is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In addition, C9orf72 expansion has also 
      been detected in patients with a clinical manifestation of Parkinson's Disease 
      (PD), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Huntington's Disease (HD), and ataxic disorders. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 1,387 patients with clinically suspected ALS, HD 
      or spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) were enrolled, and the prevalence of 
      C9orf72 expansions was estimated. RESULTS: The hexanucleotide expansion accounted 
      for 3.7% of the ALS patients, 0.2% of the HD suspected patients with excluded HTT 
      mutation, and 1.3% of the suspected SBMA patients with excluded mutation in AR 
      gene. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report revealing the presence of C9orf72 
      expansion in patients with a suspected SBMA diagnosis. Consequently, we advise 
      testing for C9orf72 expansion in patients presenting with the SBMA phenotype and 
      a genetically unsolved diagnosis.

      synaptic dysregulation in huntington's disease.
PG  - 83

LID - 83
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene for which no therapies are 
      available. HTT mutation causes protein misfolding and aggregation, preferentially 
      affecting medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the basal ganglia. Transcriptional 
      perturbations in synaptic genes and neuroinflammation are key processes that 
      precede MSN dysfunction and motor symptom onset. Understanding the interplay 
      between these processes is crucial to develop effective therapeutic strategies to 
      treat HD. We investigated the role of protein kinase CK2alpha', a kinase upregulated 
      in MSNs in HD and previously associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), in the 
      regulation of neuroinflammation and synaptic function in HD. We used the 
      heterozygous knock-in zQ175 HD mouse model and compared that to zQ175 mice 
      lacking one allele of CK2alpha' (zQ175:CK2alpha'((+/-))). CK2alpha' haploinsufficiency in zQ175 
      mice resulted in decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, HTT aggregation, 
      astrogliosis and transcriptional alterations of synaptic genes related to 
      glutamatergic signaling. zQ175:CK2alpha'((+/-)) mice also presented increased frequency 
      of striatal miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), an indicator of 
      synaptic activity, and improved motor coordination compared to zQ175 mice. 
      Neuropathological and phenotypic changes mediated by CK2alpha' were connected to 
      alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) dysregulation and correlated with differences in alpha-syn 
      serine 129 phosphorylation (pS129-alpha-syn), a post-translational modification 
      involved in alpha-synucleinopathy and shown to be regulated by CK2 in PD. pS129-alpha-syn 
      was increased in the nuclei of MSNs in zQ175 mice and in the striatum of patients 
      with HD, and it decreased in zQ175:CK2alpha'((+/-)) mice. Collectively, our data 
      established a novel connection between CK2alpha', neuroinflammation and synaptic gene 
      dysregulation with synucleinopathy in HD and suggested common molecular 
      mechanisms of neurodegeneration between HD and PD. Our results also support CK2alpha' 
      inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy to modulate neuronal function and 
      neuroprotection in HD.

TI  - Huntingtin Co-Isolates with Small Extracellular Vesicles from Blood Plasma of 
      TgHD and KI-HD Pig Models of Huntington's Disease and Human Blood Plasma.

LID - 5598
AB  - (1) Background: Huntington's disease (HD) is rare incurable hereditary 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG repeat expansion in the gene coding for 
      the protein huntingtin (HTT). Mutated huntingtin (mHTT) undergoes fragmentation 
      and accumulation, affecting cellular functions and leading to neuronal cell 
      death. Porcine models of HD are used in preclinical testing of currently emerging 
      disease modifying therapies. Such therapies are aimed at reducing mHTT 
      expression, postpone the disease onset, slow down the progression, and point out 
      the need of biomarkers to monitor disease development and therapy efficacy. 
      Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs), particularly exosomes, gained attention 
      as possible carriers of disease biomarkers. We aimed to characterize HTT and mHTT 
      forms/fragments in blood plasma derived EVs in transgenic (TgHD) and knock-in 
      (KI-HD) porcine models, as well as in HD patients' plasma. (2) Methods: Small EVs 
      were isolated by ultracentrifugation and HTT forms were visualized by western 
      blotting. (3) Results: The full length 360 kDa HTT co-isolated with EVs from both 
      the pig model and HD patient plasma. In addition, a ~70 kDa mutant HTT fragment 
      was specific for TgHD pigs. Elevated total huntingtin levels in EVs from plasma 
      of HD groups compared to controls were observed in both pig models and HD 
      patients, however only in TgHD were they significant (p = 0.02). (4) Conclusions: 
      Our study represents a valuable initial step towards the characterization of EV 
      content in the search for HD biomarkers.

AB  - Centenarians are the best example of successful aging, reaching extreme longevity 
      escaping age-related diseases. Genome sequencing studies provided evidence for 
      genetic factors linked to heathy long life, including genes related to 
      age-dependent diseases. HTT (Huntingtin) gene is linked to Huntington's Disease, 
      but also associated to longevity in capuchins and mice. HTT Intermediate alleles 
      (IAs) are defined as CAG repeat expansion between 27 and 35. According to recent 
      data IAs might increase Alzheimer's Disease risk, but also might have a 
      neuroprotective effect and can confer an advantage in brain development. Here, we 
      investigated, for the first time, the possible implication of HTT IAs in extreme 
      longevity and their possible association in cognitive decline. We analysed the 
      distribution of IAs in Italian Centenarians (n = 143) and compared with 
      pathological controls with cognitive decline (n = 232, including 80 Alzheimer's 
      Disease, 78 Frontotemporal Dementia and 74 Subjective Cognitive Decline patients) 
      and healthy controls (n = 104). Our data show a statistically significant higher 
      frequency of IAs in Centenarians with respect to pathological controls with 
      cognitive decline (p = .031; OR = 2.3097 95% CI 1.0591 to 5.0371), with a 
      percentage of 11.2 respect to 5.4 respectively. The highest presence of IAs in 
      Centenarians confirms and extends in humans a possible implication of HTT gene in 
      exceptional lifespan and in brain development with a neuroprotective effect.

TI  - Subfamily-specific differential contribution of individual monomers and the 
      tether sequence to mouse L1 promoter activity.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/s13100-022-00269-z [doi]
LID - 13
AB  - BACKGROUND: The internal promoter in L1 5'UTR is critical for autonomous L1 
      transcription and initiating retrotransposition. Unlike the human genome, which 
      features one contemporarily active subfamily, four subfamilies (A_I, Gf_I and 
      Tf_I/II) have been amplifying in the mouse genome in the last one million years. 
      Moreover, mouse L1 5'UTRs are organized into tandem repeats called monomers, 
      which are separated from ORF1 by a tether domain. In this study, we aim to 
      compare promoter activities across young mouse L1 subfamilies and investigate the 
      contribution of individual monomers and the tether sequence. RESULTS: We observed 
      an inverse relationship between subfamily age and the average number of monomers 
      among evolutionarily young mouse L1 subfamilies. The youngest subgroup (A_I and 
      Tf_I/II) on average carry 3-4 monomers in the 5'UTR. Using a single-vector 
      dual-luciferase reporter assay, we compared promoter activities across six L1 
      subfamilies (A_I/II, Gf_I and Tf_I/II/III) and established their antisense 
      promoter activities in a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line and a mouse 
      embryonal carcinoma cell line. Using consensus promoter sequences for three 
      subfamilies (A_I, Gf_I and Tf_I), we dissected the differential roles of 
      individual monomers and the tether domain in L1 promoter activity. We validated 
      that, across multiple subfamilies, the second monomer consistently enhances the 
      overall promoter activity. For individual promoter components, monomer 2 is 
      consistently more active than the corresponding monomer 1 and/or the tether for 
      each subfamily. Importantly, we revealed intricate interactions between monomer 
      2, monomer 1 and tether domains in a subfamily-specific manner. Furthermore, 
      using three-monomer 5'UTRs, we established a complex nonlinear relationship 
      between the length of the outmost monomer and the overall promoter activity. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The laboratory mouse is an important mammalian model system for 
      human diseases as well as L1 biology. Our study extends previous findings and 
      represents an important step toward a better understanding of the molecular 
      mechanism controlling mouse L1 transcription as well as L1's impact on 
      development and disease.

TI  - The distribution and density of Huntingtin inclusions across the Huntington 
      disease neocortex: regional correlations with Huntingtin repeat expansion 
      independent of pathologic grade.

AB  - Huntington disease is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, especially 
      of the striatum, and the presence of polyglutamine huntingtin (HTT) inclusions. 
      Although HTT inclusions are most abundant in the neocortex, their neocortical 
      distribution and density in relation to the extent of CAG repeat expansion in the 
      HTT gene and striatal pathologic grade have yet to be formally established. We 
      immunohistochemically studied 65 brains with a pathologic diagnosis of Huntington 
      disease to investigate the cortical distributions and densities of HTT inclusions 
      within the calcarine (BA17), precuneus (BA7), motor (BA4) and prefrontal (BA9) 
      cortices; in 39 of these brains, a p62 immunostain was used for comparison. HTT 
      inclusions predominate in the infragranular cortical layers (layers V-VI) and 
      layer III, however, the densities of HTT inclusions across the human cerebral 
      cortex are not uniform but are instead regionally contingent. The density of HTT 
      and p62 inclusions (intranuclear and extranuclear) in layers V-VI increases 
      caudally to rostrally (BA17 < BA7 < BA4 < BA9) with the median burden of HTT 
      inclusions being 38-fold greater in the prefrontal cortex (BA9) than in the 
      calcarine cortex (BA17). Conversely, intranuclear HTT inclusions prevail in the 
      calcarine cortex irrespective of HTT CAG length. Neocortical HTT inclusion 
      density correlates with CAG repeat expansion, but not with the neuropathologic 
      grade of striatal degeneration (Vonsattel grade) or with the duration of clinical 
      disease since motor onset. Extrapolation of these findings suggest that HTT 
      inclusions are at a regionally-contingent, CAG-dependent, density during the 
      advanced stages of HD. The distribution and density of HTT inclusions in HD 
      therefore does not provide a measure of pathologic disease stage but rather 
      infers the degree of pathogenic HTT expansion.

AB  - Repeat expansion diseases are a large group of human genetic disorders caused by 
      expansion of a specific short tandem repeat tract. Expansion in somatic cells 
      affects age of onset and disease severity in some of these disorders. However, 
      alleles in DNA derived from blood, a commonly used source of DNA, usually show 
      much less expansion than disease-relevant cells in the central nervous system in 
      both humans and mouse models. Here we examined the extent of expansion in 
      different DNA sources from mouse models of the fragile X-related disorders, 
      Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 and spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 2. We found that DNA isolated from stool is a much better indicator of 
      somatic expansion than DNA from blood. As stool is a sensitive and noninvasive 
      source of DNA, it can be useful for studies of factors affecting the risk of 
      expansion, or the monitoring of treatments aimed at reducing expansion in 
      preclinical trials, as it would allow expansions to be examined longitudinally in 
      the same animal and allow significant changes in expansion to be observed much 
      earlier than is possible with other DNA sources.

TI  - Tissue-specific and repeat length-dependent somatic instability of the X-linked 
      dystonia parkinsonism-associated CCCTCT repeat.

AB  - X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is a progressive adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by insertion of a SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) 
      retrotransposon in the TAF1 gene. The SVA retrotransposon contains a CCCTCT 
      hexameric repeat tract of variable length, whose length is inversely correlated 
      with age at onset. This places XDP in a broader class of repeat expansion 
      diseases, characterized by the instability of their causative repeat mutations. 
      Here, we observe similar inverse correlations between CCCTCT repeat length with 
      age at onset and age at death and no obvious correlation with disease duration. 
      To gain insight into repeat instability in XDP we performed comprehensive 
      quantitative analyses of somatic instability of the XDP CCCTCT repeat in blood 
      and in seventeen brain regions from affected males. Our findings reveal repeat 
      length-dependent and expansion-based instability of the XDP CCCTCT repeat, with 
      greater levels of expansion in brain than in blood. The brain exhibits 
      regional-specific patterns of instability that are broadly similar across 
      individuals, with cerebellum exhibiting low instability and cortical regions 
      exhibiting relatively high instability. The spectrum of somatic instability in 
      the brain includes a high proportion of moderate repeat length changes of up to 5 
      repeats, as well as expansions of ~ 20- > 100 repeats and contractions of ~ 20-40 
      repeats at lower frequencies. Comparison with HTT CAG repeat instability in 
      postmortem Huntington's disease brains reveals similar brain region-specific 
      profiles, indicating common trans-acting factors that contribute to the 
      instability of both repeats. Analyses in XDP brains of expansion of a different 
      SVA-associated CCCTCT located in the LIPG gene, and not known to be 
      disease-associated, reveals repeat length-dependent expansion at overall lower 
      levels relative to the XDP CCCTCT repeat, suggesting that expansion propensity 
      may be modified by local chromatin structure. Together, the data support a role 
      for repeat length-dependent somatic expansion in the process(es) driving the 
      onset of XDP and prompt further investigation into repeat dynamics and the 
      relationship to disease.

AB  - The age at onset of motor symptoms in Huntington's disease (HD) is driven by HTT 
      CAG repeat length but modified by other genes. In this study, we used exome 
      sequencing of 683 patients with HD with extremes of onset or phenotype relative 
      to CAG length to identify rare variants associated with clinical effect. We 
      discovered damaging coding variants in candidate modifier genes identified in 
      previous genome-wide association studies associated with altered HD onset or 
      severity. Variants in FAN1 clustered in its DNA-binding and nuclease domains and 
      were associated predominantly with earlier-onset HD. Nuclease activities of 
      purified variants in vitro correlated with residual age at motor onset of HD. 
      Mutating endogenous FAN1 to a nuclease-inactive form in an induced pluripotent 
      stem cell model of HD led to rates of CAG expansion similar to those observed 
      with complete FAN1 knockout. Together, these data implicate FAN1 nuclease 
      activity in slowing somatic repeat expansion and hence onset of HD.

TI  - CAG Repeats Within the Non-pathological Range in the HTT Gene Influence 
      Personality Traits in Patients With Subjective Cognitive Decline: A 13-Year 
      Follow-Up Study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: HTT is a gene containing a key region of CAG repeats. When expanded 
      beyond 39 repeats, Huntington disease (HD) develops. HTT genes with <35 repeats 
      are not associated with HD. The biological function of CAG repeat expansion below 
      the non-pathological threshold is not well understood. In fact higher number of 
      repeats in HTT confer advantageous changes in brain structure and general 
      intelligence, but several studies focused on establishing the association between 
      CAG expansions and susceptibility to psychiatric disturbances and to other 
      neurodegenerative disease than HD. We hypothesized that HTT CAG repeat length 
      below the pathological threshold might influence mood and personality traits in a 
      longitudinal sample of individuals with Subjective Cognitive Decline. METHODS: We 
      included 54 patients with SCD. All patients underwent an extensive 
      neuropsychological battery at baseline, APOE genotyping and analysis of HTT 
      alleles. We used the Big Five Factors Questionnaire (BFFQ) and Hamilton 
      Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), respectively, to assess personality traits of 
      patients and depression at baseline. Patients who did not progress to Mild 
      Cognitive Impairment (MCI) had at least 5-year follow-up time. RESULTS: In the 
      whole sample, CAG repeat number in the shorter HTT allele was inversely 
      correlated with conscientiousness (Pearson = -0.364, p = 0.007). There was no 
      correlation between HDRS and CAG repeats. During the follow-up, 14 patients 
      [25.93% (95% C.I. = 14.24-37.61)] progressed to MCI (MCI(+)) and 40 [74.07% (95% 
      C.I. = 62.39-85.76)] did not (MCI(-)). When we performed the same analysis in the 
      MCI(+) group we found that: CAG repeat length on the shorter allele was inversely 
      correlated with energy (Pearson = 0.639, p = 0.014) and conscientiousness 
      (Pearson = -0.695, p = 0.006). CAG repeat length on the longer allele was 
      inversely correlated with conscientiousness (Pearson = -0.901, p < 0.001) and 
      directly correlated with emotional stability (Pearson = 0.639, p = 0.014). These 
      associations were confirmed also by multivariate analysis. We found no 
      correlations between BFFQ parameters and CAG repeats in the MCI(-) group. 
      DISCUSSION: Personality traits and CAG repeat length in the intermediate range 
      have been associated with progression of cognitive decline and neuropathological 
      findings consistent with AD. We showed that CAG repeat lengths in the HTT gene 
      within the non-pathological range influence personality traits.

TI  - Clinical and genetic characteristics of late-onset Huntington's disease in a 
      large European cohort.
PG  - 1940-1951
LID - 10.1111/ene.15340 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant 
      condition caused by CAG-triplet repeat expansions. CAG-triplet repeat expansion 
      is inversely correlated with age of onset in HD and largely determines the 
      clinical features. The aim of this study was to examine the phenotypic and 
      genotypic correlates of late-onset HD (LoHD) and to determine whether LoHD is a 
      more benign expression of HD. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational 
      study of 5053 White European HD patients from the ENROLL-HD database. 
      Sociodemographic, genetic and phenotypic variables at baseline evaluation of 
      subjects with LoHD, common-onset HD (CoHD) and young-onset HD (YoHD) were 
      compared. LoHD subjects were compared with healthy subjects (HS) aged >/=60 years. 
      Differences between the CoHD and LoHD groups were also explored in subjects with 
      41 CAG triplets, a repeat number in the lower pathological expansion range 
      associated with wide variability in age at onset. RESULTS: Late-onset HD 
      presented predominantly as motor-onset disease, with a lower prevalence of both 
      psychiatric history and current symptomatology. Absent/unknown HD family history 
      was significantly more common in the LoHD group (31.2%) than in the other groups. 
      The LoHD group had more severe motor and cognitive deficits than the HS group. 
      Subjects with LoHD and CoHD with 41 triplets in the larger allele were comparable 
      with regard to cognitive impairment, but those with LoHD had more severe motor 
      disorders, less problematic behaviors and more often an unknown HD family 
      history. CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that cognitive disorders and motor symptoms of 
      LoHD are at least partly age-related and not a direct expression of the disease. 
      In addition to CAG-triplet repeat expansion, future studies should investigate 
      the role of other genetic and environmental factors in determining age of onset.

AB  - Huntington's Disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions in exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene. The 
      mutant HTT (mHTT) protein causes neuronal dysfunction, causing progressive motor, 
      cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. Current treatments for HD only alleviate 
      symptoms, but cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) or central nervous system (CNS) 
      delivery of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) or virus vectors expressing 
      RNA-induced silencing (RNAi) moieties designed to induce mHTT mRNA lowering have 
      progressed to clinical trials. Here, we present an alternative disease modifying 
      therapy the orally available, brain penetrant small molecule branaplam. By 
      promoting inclusion of a pseudoexon in the primary transcript, branaplam lowers 
      mHTT protein levels in HD patient cells, in an HD mouse model and in blood 
      samples from Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type I patients dosed orally for SMA 
      (NCT02268552). Our work paves the way for evaluating branaplam's utility as an  
      HD therapy, leveraging small molecule splicing modulators to reduce expression of 
      dominant disease genes by driving pseudoexon inclusion.

      network modules in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 479-493

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin 
      (HTT) gene. Knock-in mice carrying a CAG repeat-expanded Htt will develop HD 
      phenotypes. Previous studies suggested dysregulated molecular networks in a CAG 
      length genotype- and the age-dependent manner in brain tissues from knock-in mice 
      carrying expanded Htt CAG repeats. Furthermore, a large-scale phenome analysis 
      defined a behavioral signature for HD genotype in knock-in mice carrying expanded 
      Htt CAG repeats. However, an integrated analysis correlating phenotype features 
      with genotypes (CAG repeat expansions) was not conducted previously. In this 
      study, we revealed the landscape of the behavioral features and gene expression 
      correlations based on 445 mRNA samples and 445 microRNA samples, together with 
      behavioral features (396 PhenoCube behaviors and 111 NeuroCube behaviors) in Htt 
      CAG-knock-in mice. We identified 37 behavioral features that were significantly 
      associated with CAG repeat length including the number of steps and hind limb 
      stand duration. The behavioral features were associated with several gene 
      coexpression groups involved in neuronal dysfunctions, which were also supported 
      by the single-cell RNA sequencing data in the striatum and the spatial gene 
      expression in the brain. We also identified 15 chemicals with significant 
      responses for genes with enriched behavioral features, most of them are agonist 
      or antagonist for dopamine receptors and serotonin receptors used for 
      neurology/psychiatry. Our study provides further evidence that abnormal neuronal 
      signal transduction in the striatum plays an important role in causing HD-related 
      phenotypic behaviors and provided rich information for the further 
      pharmacotherapeutic intervention possibility for HD.

      disorders in the UK: a retrospective diagnostic accuracy and prospective clinical 
      validation study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansion disorders affect about 1 in 3000 individuals and are 
      clinically heterogeneous diseases caused by expansions of short tandem DNA 
      repeats. Genetic testing is often locus-specific, resulting in underdiagnosis of 
      people who have atypical clinical presentations, especially in paediatric 
      patients without a previous positive family history. Whole genome sequencing is 
      increasingly used as a first-line test for other rare genetic disorders, and we 
      aimed to assess its performance in the diagnosis of patients with neurological 
      repeat expansion disorders. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic 
      accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect the most common repeat expansion 
      loci associated with neurological outcomes (AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, 
      C9orf72, CACNA1A, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, and TBP) using samples obtained within 
      the National Health Service in England from patients who were suspected of having 
      neurological disorders; previous PCR test results were used as the reference 
      standard. The clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat 
      expansions was prospectively examined in previously genetically tested and 
      undiagnosed patients recruited in 2013-17 to the 100 000 Genomes Project in the 
      UK, who were suspected of having a genetic neurological disorder (familial or 
      early-onset forms of ataxia, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, dementia, motor 
      neuron disease, parkinsonian movement disorders, intellectual disability, or 
      neuromuscular disorders). If a repeat expansion call was made using whole genome 
      sequencing, PCR was used to confirm the result. FINDINGS: The diagnostic accuracy 
      of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat expansions was evaluated against 793 
      PCR tests previously performed within the NHS from 404 patients. Whole genome 
      sequencing correctly classified 215 of 221 expanded alleles and 1316 of 1321 
      non-expanded alleles, showing 97.3% sensitivity (95% CI 94.2-99.0) and 99.6% 
      specificity (99.1-99.9) across the 13 disease-associated loci when compared with 
      PCR test results. In samples from 11 631 patients in the 100 000 Genomes Project, 
      whole genome sequencing identified 81 repeat expansions, which were also tested 
      by PCR: 68 were confirmed as repeat expansions in the full pathogenic range, 11 
      were non-pathogenic intermediate expansions or premutations, and two were 
      non-expanded repeats (16% false discovery rate). INTERPRETATION: In our study, 
      whole genome sequencing for the detection of repeat expansions showed high 
      sensitivity and specificity, and it led to identification of neurological repeat 
      expansion disorders in previously undiagnosed patients. These findings support 
      implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical laboratories for diagnosis 
      of patients who have a neurological presentation consistent with a repeat 
      expansion disorder. FUNDING: Medical Research Council, Department of Health and

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Metabolic changes are associated with HD 
      progression, but underlying mechanisms are not fully known. As the IKKbeta/NF-kappaB 
      pathway is an essential regulator of metabolism, we investigated the involvement 
      of IKKbeta, the upstream activator of NF-kappaB in hypothalamus-specific HD metabolic 
      changes. We expressed amyloidogenic N-terminal fragments of mutant HTT (mHTT) in 
      the hypothalamus of mice with brain-specific ablation of IKKbeta 
      (Nestin/IKKbeta(lox/lox)) and control mice (IKKbeta(lox/lox)). We assessed effects on 
      body weight, metabolic hormones, and hypothalamic neuropathology. Hypothalamic 
      expression of mHTT led to an obese phenotype only in female mice. CNS-specific 
      inactivation of IKKbeta prohibited weight gain in females, which was independent of 
      neuroprotection and microglial activation. Our study suggests that mHTT in the 
      hypothalamus causes metabolic imbalance in a sex-specific fashion, and central 
      inhibition of the IKKbeta pathway attenuates the obese phenotype.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the HTT gene encoding an elongated polyglutamine tract in the 
      huntingtin (HTT) protein. Expanded mutant HTT (mHTT) is toxic and leads to 
      regional atrophy and neuronal cell loss in the brain, which occurs earliest in 
      the striatum. Therapeutic lowering of mHTT in the central nervous system (CNS) 
      has shown promise in preclinical studies, with multiple approaches currently in 
      clinical development for HD. Quantitation of mHTT in the cerebrospinal fluid 
      (CSF) is being used as a clinical pharmacodynamic biomarker of target engagement 
      in the CNS. We have previously shown that the CNS is a major source of mHTT in 
      the CSF. However, little is known about the specific brain regions and cell types 
      that contribute to CSF mHTT. Therefore, a better understanding of the origins of 
      CSF mHTT and whether therapies targeting mHTT in the striatum would be expected 
      to be associated with significant lowering of mHTT in the CSF is needed. Here, we 
      use complementary pharmacological and genetic-based approaches to either restrict 
      expression of mHTT to the striatum or selectively deplete mHTT in the striatum to 
      evaluate the contribution of this brain region to mHTT in the CSF. We show that 
      viral expression of a mHTT fragment restricted to the striatum leads to 
      detectable mHTT in the CSF. We demonstrate that targeted lowering of mHTT 
      selectively in the striatum using an antisense oligonucleotide leads to a 
      significant reduction of mHTT in the CSF of HD mice. Furthermore, using a 
      transgenic mouse model of HD that expresses full length human mHTT and wild type 
      HTT, we show that genetic inactivation of mHTT selectively in the striatum 
      results in a significant reduction of mHTT in the CSF. Taken together, our data 
      supports the conclusion that the striatum contributes sufficiently to the pool of 
      mHTT in the CSF that therapeutic levels of mHTT lowering in the striatum can be 
      detected by this measure in HD mice. This suggests that CSF mHTT may represent a 
      pharmacodynamic biomarker for therapies that lower mHTT in the striatum.

TI  - Absence of a significant interaction of two common NOS1 and 5-HTT polymorphisms 
      on sensorimotor gating in humans.
PG  - S387-S395
AB  - The neurotransmitter serotonin has been critically implicated in the pathogenesis 
      of several mental disorders. The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is a key regulator 
      of serotonergic neurotransmission and its genetic variability is associated with 
      increased risk of psychopathology. One well known polymorphic locus in the 5-HTT 
      gene affecting its expression is a tandem repeat in the promoter region 
      (5-HTTLPR). It has been reported that 5-HTT is functionally coupled with the 
      neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1 or nNOS), an enzyme catalyzing the 
      production of nitric oxide (NO). We have previously demonstrated that a tandem 
      repeat polymorphism in the promoter of NOS1 exon 1f (Ex1f-VNTR) is associated 
      with sensorimotor gating, a marker of inhibitory processing and a well 
      established endophenotype of several neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we 
      investigated the combined genetic effects of NOS1 Ex1f-VNTR and 5-HTTLPR on 
      sensorimotor gating, measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic 
      startle reflex, in 164 healthy adults. We found no evidence for the interaction 
      between NOS1 Ex1f-VNTR and 5-HTTLPR on PPI. PPI was associated with NOS1 
      Ex1f-VNTR, but not 5-HTTLPR. Our data suggest that while NOS1 plays a role in 
      sensorimotor gating, the nitrergic pathway of gating regulation does not involve 
      the action of 5-HTT.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is the most common monogenic neurodegenerative disease 
      and is fatal. CAG repeat expansions in mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) exon 1 encode for 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches and influence age of onset and disease severity, 
      depending on their length. mHTT is more structured compared to wild-type (wt) 
      HTT, resulting in a decreased N-terminal conformational flexibility. mHTT 
      inflexibility may contribute to both gain of function toxicity, due to increased 
      mHTT aggregation propensity, but also to loss of function phenotypes, due to 
      decreased interactions with binding partners. High-throughput-screening 
      techniques to identify mHTT flexibility states and potential flexibility 
      modifying small molecules are currently lacking. Here, we propose a novel 
      approach for identifying small molecules that restore mHTT's conformational 
      flexibility in human patient fibroblasts. We have applied a well-established 
      antibody-based time-resolved Forster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) 
      immunoassay, which measures endogenous HTT flexibility using two validated 
      HTT-specific antibodies, to a high-throughput screening platform. By performing a 
      small-scale compound screen, we identified several small molecules that can 
      partially rescue mHTT inflexibility, presumably by altering HTT 
      post-translational modifications. Thus, we demonstrated that the HTT TR-FRET 
      immunoassay can be miniaturized and applied to a compound screening workflow in 
      patient cells. This automated assay can now be used in large screening campaigns 
      to identify previously unknown HD drugs and drug targets.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a severe inherited neurological disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT), leading to the accumulation of 
      mutant huntingtin with polyglutamine repeats. Despite its severity, there is no 
      cure for this debilitating disease. HTT lowering strategies, including antisense 
      oligonucleotides (ASO) showed promising results very recently. Attempts to 
      develop stem cell-based therapeutics have shown efficacy in preclinical HD 
      models. Using an HD patient's autologous cells, which have genetic defects, may 
      hamper therapeutic efficacy due to mutant HTT. Pretreating these cells to reduce 
      mutant HTT expression and transcription may improve the transplanted cells' 
      therapeutic efficacy. To investigate this, we targeted the SUPT4H1 gene that 
      selectively supports the transcription of long trinucleotide repeats. 
      Transplanting SUPT4H1-edited HD-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural 
      precursor cells (iPSC-NPCs) into the YAC128 HD transgenic mouse model improved 
      motor function compared to unedited HD iPSC-NPCs. Immunohistochemical analysis 
      revealed reduced mutant HTT expression without compensating wild-type HTT 
      expression. Further, SUPT4H1 editing increased neuronal and decreased reactive 
      astrocyte differentiation in HD iPSC-NPCs compared to the unedited HD iPSC-NPCs. 
      This suggests that ex vivo editing of SUPT4H1 can reduce mutant HTT expression 
      and provide a therapeutic gene editing strategy for autologous stem cell 
      transplantation in HD.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder with progressive 
      motor dysfunction and cognitive decline. The disease is caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the IT15 gene, which elongates a polyglutamine stretch of the HD 
      protein, Huntingtin. No therapeutic treatments are available, and new 
      pharmacological targets are needed. Retrotransposons are transposable elements 
      (TEs) that represent 40% and 30% of the human and Drosophila genomes and 
      replicate through an RNA intermediate. Mounting evidence suggests that mammalian 
      TEs are active during neurogenesis and may be involved in diseases of the nervous 
      system. Here we show that TE expression and mobilization are increased in a 
      Drosophila melanogaster HD model. By inhibiting TE mobilization with Reverse 
      Transcriptase inhibitors, polyQ-dependent eye neurodegeneration and genome 
      instability in larval brains are rescued and fly lifespan is increased. These 
      results suggest that TE activation may be involved in polyQ-induced neurotoxicity 
      and a potential pharmacological target.

AB  - Atxn10 is a gene known for its role in cytokinesis and is associated with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA10), a slowly progressing cerebellar syndrome caused 
      by an intragenic pentanucleotide repeat expansion. Atxn10 is also implicated in 
      the ciliopathy syndromes nephronophthisis (NPHP) and Joubert syndrome (JBTS), 
      which are caused by the disruption of cilia function leading to nephron loss, 
      impaired renal function, and cerebellar hypoplasia. How Atxn10 disruption 
      contributes to these disorders remains unknown. Here, we generated Atxn10 
      congenital and conditional mutant mouse models. Our data indicate that while 
      ATXN10 protein can be detected around the base of the cilium as well as in the 
      cytosol, its loss does not cause overt changes in cilia formation or morphology. 
      Congenital loss of Atxn10 results in embryonic lethality around E10.5 associated 
      with pericardial effusion and loss of trabeculation. Similarly, tissue-specific 
      loss of ATXN10 in the developing endothelium (Tie2-Cre) and myocardium (cTnT-Cre) 
      also results in embryonic lethality with severe cardiac malformations occurring 
      in the latter. Using an inducible Cagg-CreER to disrupt ATXN10 systemically at 
      postnatal stages, we show that ATXN10 is also required for survival in adult 
      mice. Loss of ATXN10 results in severe pancreatic and renal abnormalities leading 
      to lethality within a few weeks post ATXN10 deletion in adult mice. Evaluation of 
      these phenotypes further identified rapid epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition 
      (EMT) in these tissues. In the pancreas, the phenotype includes signs of both 
      acinar to ductal metaplasia and EMT with aberrant cilia formation and severe 
      defects in glucose homeostasis related to pancreatic insufficiency or defects in 
      feeding or nutrient intake. Collectively, this study identifies ATXN10 as an 
      essential protein for survival.

TI  - Identification of Novel Therapeutic Targets for Polyglutamine Diseases That 
      Target Mitochondrial Fragmentation.
LID - 10.3390/ijms222413447 [doi]
LID - 13447
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is one of at least nine polyglutamine diseases caused 
      by a trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion, all of which lead to age-onset 
      neurodegeneration. Mitochondrial dynamics and function are disrupted in HD and 
      other polyglutamine diseases. While multiple studies have found beneficial 
      effects from decreasing mitochondrial fragmentation in HD models by disrupting 
      the mitochondrial fission protein DRP1, disrupting DRP1 can also have detrimental 
      consequences in wild-type animals and HD models. In this work, we examine the 
      effect of decreasing mitochondrial fragmentation in a neuronal C. elegans model 
      of polyglutamine toxicity called Neur-67Q. We find that Neur-67Q worms exhibit 
      mitochondrial fragmentation in GABAergic neurons and decreased mitochondrial 
      function. Disruption of drp-1 eliminates differences in mitochondrial morphology 
      and rescues deficits in both movement and longevity in Neur-67Q worms. In testing 
      twenty-four RNA interference (RNAi) clones that decrease mitochondrial 
      fragmentation, we identified eleven clones-each targeting a different gene-that 
      increase movement and extend lifespan in Neur-67Q worms. Overall, we show that 
      decreasing mitochondrial fragmentation may be an effective approach to treating 
      polyglutamine diseases and we identify multiple novel genetic targets that 
      circumvent the potential negative side effects of disrupting the primary 
      mitochondrial fission gene drp-1.

TI  - Developmental Exposure to a Human-Relevant Polychlorinated Biphenyl Mixture 
      Causes Behavioral Phenotypes That Vary by Sex and Genotype in Juvenile Mice 
      Expressing Human Mutations That Modulate Neuronal Calcium.

AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are putative environmental risks for 
      neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we tested two hypotheses: (1) developmental 
      exposure to a human-relevant PCB mixture causes behavioral phenotypes relevant to 
      neurodevelopmental disorders; and (2) expression of human mutations that 
      dysregulate neuronal Ca(2+) homeostasis influence sensitivity to behavioral 
      effects of developmental PCB exposures. To test these hypotheses, we used mice 
      that expressed a gain-of-function mutation (T4826I) in ryanodine receptor 1 
      (RYR1), the X-linked fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) CGG repeat expansion 
      or both mutations (double mutant; DM). Transgenic mice and wildtype (WT) mice 
      were exposed to the MARBLES PCB mix at 0, 0.1, 1, and 6 mg/kg/day in the maternal 
      diet throughout gestation and lactation. The MARBLES PCB mix simulates the 
      relative proportions of the 12 most abundant PCB congeners found in the serum of 
      pregnant women at increased risk for having a child with a neurodevelopmental 
      disorder. We assessed ultrasonic vocalizations at postnatal day 7 (P7), 
      spontaneous repetitive behaviors at P25-P30, and sociability at P27-P32. 
      Developmental PCB exposure reduced ultrasonic vocalizations in WT litters in all 
      dose groups, but had no effect on ultrasonic vocalizations in transgenic litters. 
      Developmental PCB exposure significantly increased self-grooming and decreased 
      sociability in WT males in the 0.1 mg/kg dose group, but had no effect on WT 
      females in any dose group. Genotype alone influenced ultrasonic vocalizations, 
      self-grooming and to a lesser extent sociability. Genotype alone also influenced 
      effects of PCBs on sociability. PCB levels in the brain tissue of pups increased 
      in a dose-dependent manner, but within any dose group did not differ between 
      genotypes. In summary, developmental PCB exposure phenocopied social behavior 
      phenotypes observed in mice expressing human mutations that modify intracellular 
      Ca(2+) dynamics, and expression of these mutations alleviated PCB effects on 
      ultrasonic vocalizations and repetitive behavior, and modified the dose-response 
      relationships and sex-dependent effects of PCB effects on social behavior. These 
      findings suggest that: (1) developmental PCB exposure causes behavioral 
      phenotypes that vary by sex and genotype; and (2) sex-specific responses to 
      environmental factors may contribute to sex biases in the prevalence and/or 
      severity of neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - While many neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are thought to result from 
      interactions between environmental and genetic risk factors, the identification 
      of specific gene-environment interactions that influence NDD risk remains a 
      critical data gap. We tested the hypothesis that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 
      interact with human mutations that alter the fidelity of neuronal Ca(2+) 
      signaling to confer NDD risk. To test this, we used three transgenic mouse lines 
      that expressed human mutations known to alter Ca(2+) signals in neurons: (1) 
      gain-of-function mutation in ryanodine receptor-1 (T4826I-RYR1); (2) CGG-repeat 
      expansion in the 5' non-coding portion of the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 
      (FMR1); and (3) a double mutant (DM) that expressed both mutations. Transgenic 
      and wildtype (WT) mice were exposed throughout gestation and lactation to the 
      MARBLES PCB mix at 0.1, 1, or 6 mg/kg in the maternal diet. The MARBLES mix 
      simulates the relative proportions of the twelve most abundant PCB congeners 
      found in serum from pregnant women at increased risk for having a child with an 
      NDD. Using Golgi staining, the effect of developmental PCB exposure on dendritic 
      arborization of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 hippocampus and somatosensory cortex 
      of male and female WT mice was compared to pyramidal neurons from transgenic 
      mice. A multilevel linear mixed-effects model identified a main effect of dose 
      driven by increased dendritic arborization of cortical neurons in the 1 mg/kg PCB 
      dose group. Subsequent analyses with genotypes indicated that the MARBLES PCB 
      mixture had no effect on the dendritic arborization of hippocampal neurons in WT 
      mice of either sex, but significantly increased dendritic arborization of 
      cortical neurons of WT males in the 6 mg/kg PCB dose group. Transgene expression 
      increased sensitivity to the impact of developmental PCB exposure on dendritic 
      arborization in a sex-, and brain region-dependent manner. In conclusion, 
      developmental exposure to PCBs present in the gestational environment of at-risk 
      humans interfered with normal dendritic morphogenesis in the developing mouse 
      brain in a sex-, genotype- and brain region-dependent manner. Overall, these 
      observations provide proof-of-principle evidence that PCBs interact with 
      heritable mutations to modulate a neurodevelopmental outcome of relevance to 
      NDDs.

TI  - FAN1's protection against CGG repeat expansion requires its nuclease activity and

AB  - The Repeat Expansion Diseases, a large group of human diseases that includes the 
      fragile X-related disorders (FXDs) and Huntington's disease (HD), all result from 
      expansion of a disease-specific microsatellite via a mechanism that is not fully 
      understood. We have previously shown that mismatch repair (MMR) proteins are 
      required for expansion in a mouse model of the FXDs, but that the FANCD2 and 
      FANCI associated nuclease 1 (FAN1), a component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA 
      repair pathway, is protective. FAN1's nuclease activity has been reported to be 
      dispensable for protection against expansion in an HD cell model. However, we 
      show here that in a FXD mouse model a point mutation in the nuclease domain of 
      FAN1 has the same effect on expansion as a null mutation. Furthermore, we show 
      that FAN1 and another nuclease, EXO1, have an additive effect in protecting 
      against MSH3-dependent expansions. Lastly, we show that the loss of FANCD2, a 
      vital component of the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway, has no effect on 
      expansions. Thus, FAN1 protects against MSH3-dependent expansions without 
      diverting the expansion intermediates into the canonical FA pathway and this 
      protection depends on FAN1 having an intact nuclease domain.

      Parallel-Group, Phase 2a Study.
PG  - 757825

AB  - Background: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common single-gene cause of 
      intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is caused by a 
      >200-trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region of the fragile 
      X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Individuals with FXS can present with a range 
      of neurobehavioral impairments including, but not limited to: cognitive, 
      language, and adaptive deficits; ASD; anxiety; social withdrawal and avoidance; 
      and aggression. Decreased expression of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) 
      receptor delta subunit and deficient GABAergic tonic inhibition could be associated 
      with symptoms of FXS. Gaboxadol (OV101) is a delta-subunit-selective, extrasynaptic 
      GABA(A) receptor agonist that enhances GABAergic tonic inhibition, providing the 
      rationale for assessment of OV101 as a potential targeted treatment of FXS. No 
      drug is approved in the United States for the treatment of FXS. Methods: This 
      12-weeks, randomized (1:1:1), double-blind, parallel-group, phase 2a study was 
      designed to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and optimal daily dose of 
      OV101 5 mg [once (QD), twice (BID), or three-times daily (TID)] when administered 
      for 12 weeks to adolescent and adult men with FXS. Safety was the primary study 
      objective, with key assessments including treatment-emergent adverse events 
      (TEAEs), treatment-related adverse events leading to study discontinuation, and 
      serious adverse events (SAEs). The secondary study objective was to evaluate the 
      effect of OV101 on a variety of problem behaviors. Results: A total of 23 
      participants with FXS (13 adolescents, 10 adults) with moderate-to-severe 
      neurobehavioral phenotypes (Full Scale Intelligence Quotient, 41.5 +/- 3.29; ASD, 
      82.6%) were randomized to OV101 5 mg QD (n = 8), 5 mg BID (n = 8), or 5 mg TID (n 
      = 7) for 12 weeks. OV101 was well tolerated across all 3 treatment regimens. The 
      most common TEAEs were upper respiratory tract infection (n = 4), headache (n = 
      3), diarrhea (n = 2), and irritability (n = 2). No SAEs were reported. 
      Improvements from baseline to end-of-treatment were observed on several efficacy 
      endpoints, and 60% of participants were identified as treatment responders based 
      on Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement. Conclusions: Overall, OV101 was safe 
      and well tolerated. Efficacy results demonstrate an initial signal for OV101 in 
      individuals with FXS. These results need to be confirmed in a larger, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled study with optimal outcomes and in the most appropriate age 
      group. Clinical Trial Registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: 
      NCT03697161.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an abnormal 
      CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion within exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene. 
      This mutation leads to the production of mutant HTT (mHTT) protein which triggers 
      neuronal death through several mechanisms. Here, we investigated the 
      neuroprotective effects of esculetin (ESC), a bioactive phenolic compound, in an 
      inducible PC12 model and a transgenic Drosophila melanogaster model of HD, both 
      of which express mHTT fragments. ESC partially inhibited the progression of mHTT 
      aggregation and reduced neuronal death through its ability to counteract the 
      oxidative stress and mitochondria impairment elicited by mHTT in the PC12 model. 
      The ability of ESC to counteract neuronal death was also confirmed in the 
      transgenic Drosophila model. Although ESC did not modify the lifespan of the 
      transgenic Drosophila, it still seemed to have a positive impact on the HD 
      phenotype of this model. Based on our findings, ESC may be further studied as a 
      potential neuroprotective agent in a rodent transgenic model of HD.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Here, we examined the effects 
      of antioxidants on 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP; a mitochondrial complex II 
      inhibitor)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in STHdhQ111 striatal 
      cells carrying homozygous mutant HTT with extended CAG repeats compared with 
      those in STHdhQ7 striatal cells. 3-NP reduced cell viability and increased cell 
      death both in STHdhQ111 and STHdhQ7, and the cytotoxicity was markedly attenuated 
      by antioxidants (N-acetyl-l-cysteine and edaravone). Furthermore, 3-NP increased 
      intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in both cell lines, and 
      this increase was inhibited by antioxidants. Mitochondrial ROS was also increased 
      by 3-NP in STHdhQ111 but not in STHdhQ7, and this increase was significantly 
      inhibited by edaravone. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was lower in 
      STHdhQ111 than that in STHdhQ7, and antioxidants prevented 3-NP-induced MMP 
      decrease in STHdhQ111.3-NP enhanced oligomerization of dynamin-related protein 1 
      (Drp1), a protein that promotes mitochondrial fission in both cells, and both 
      antioxidants prevented the increase in oligomerization. These results suggest 
      that reduced mitochondrial complex II activity enhances cell death via 
      intracellular ROS production and Drp1 oligomerization in striatal cells with 
      mutant HTT and antioxidants may reduce striatal cell death.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT). Disease progression is 
      characterized by the loss of vulnerable neuronal populations within the striatum. 
      A consistent phenotype across HD models is disruption of nucleocytoplasmic 
      transport and nuclear pore complex (NPC) function. Here we demonstrate that high 
      content imaging is a suitable method for detecting mislocalization of lamin-B1, 
      RAN and RANGAP1 in striatal neuronal cultures thus allowing a robust, unbiased, 
      highly powered approach to assay nuclear pore deficits. Furthermore, nuclear pore 
      deficits extended to the selectively vulnerable DARPP32 + subpopulation neurons, 
      but not to astrocytes. Striatal neuron cultures are further affected by changes 
      in gene and protein expression of RAN, RANGAP1 and lamin-B1. Lowering total HTT 
      using HTT-targeted anti-sense oligonucleotides partially restored gene 
      expression, as well as subtly reducing mislocalization of proteins involved in 
      nucleocytoplasmic transport. This suggests that mislocalization of RAN, RANGAP1 
      and lamin-B1 cannot be normalized by simply reducing expression of CAG-expanded 
      HTT in the absence of healthy HTT protein.

      Models of Huntington's Disease.
PG  - 1753-1772
LID - 10.14336/AD.2021.0404 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
      trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene. While the pathogenesis of HD 
      is incompletely understood, mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be a key 
      contributor. In this work, we used C. elegans models to elucidate the role of 
      mitochondrial dynamics in HD. We found that expression of a disease-length 
      polyglutamine tract in body wall muscle, either with or without exon 1 of 
      huntingtin, results in mitochondrial fragmentation and mitochondrial network 
      disorganization. While mitochondria in young HD worms form elongated tubular 
      networks as in wild-type worms, mitochondrial fragmentation occurs with age as 
      expanded polyglutamine protein forms aggregates. To correct the deficit in 
      mitochondrial morphology, we reduced levels of DRP-1, the GTPase responsible for 
      mitochondrial fission. Surprisingly, we found that disrupting drp-1 can have 
      detrimental effects, which are dependent on how much expression is decreased. To 
      avoid potential negative side effects of disrupting drp-1, we examined whether 
      decreasing mitochondrial fragmentation by targeting other genes could be 
      beneficial. Through this approach, we identified multiple genetic targets that 
      rescue movement deficits in worm models of HD. Three of these genetic targets, 
      pgp-3, F25B5.6 and alh-12, increased movement in the HD worm model and restored 
      mitochondrial morphology to wild-type morphology. This work demonstrates that 
      disrupting the mitochondrial fission gene drp-1 can be detrimental in animal 
      models of HD, but that decreasing mitochondrial fragmentation by targeting other 
      genes can be protective. Overall, this study identifies novel therapeutic targets 
      for HD aimed at improving mitochondrial health.

AB  - Transcribed CGG repeat expansions cause neurodegeneration in Fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). CGG repeat RNAs sequester RNA-binding proteins 
      (RBPs) into nuclear foci and undergo repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation 
      into toxic peptides. To identify proteins involved in these processes, we 
      employed a CGG repeat RNA-tagging system to capture repeat-associated RBPs by 
      mass spectrometry in mammalian cells. We identified several SR 
      (serine/arginine-rich) proteins that interact selectively with CGG repeats 
      basally and under cellular stress. These proteins modify toxicity in a Drosophila 
      model of FXTAS. Pharmacologic inhibition of serine/arginine protein kinases 
      (SRPKs), which alter SRSF protein phosphorylation, localization, and activity, 
      directly inhibits RAN translation of CGG and GGGGCC repeats (associated with 
      C9orf72 ALS/FTD) and triggers repeat RNA retention in the nucleus. Lowering SRPK 
      expression suppressed toxicity in both FXTAS and C9orf72 ALS/FTD model flies, and 
      SRPK inhibitors suppressed CGG repeat toxicity in rodent neurons. Together, these 
      findings demonstrate roles for CGG repeat RNA binding proteins in RAN translation 
      and repeat toxicity and support further evaluation of SRPK inhibitors in 
      modulating RAN translation associated with repeat expansion disorders.

TI  - Neurofilament Light Chain and Intermediate HTT Alleles as Combined Biomarkers in

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the possible implication of the two biomarkers, intermediate 
      alleles (IAs) of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene and neurofilament light chain (NfL) 
      levels in plasma, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. METHODS: We 
      analyzed IAs in a cohort of 106 Italian ALS patients and measured the plasma NfL 
      levels in 20% of the patients of the cohort. We correlated the two biomarkers 
      with clinical phenotypes. RESULTS: Intermediate alleles were present in 7.5% of 
      the patients of our cohort, a frequency higher than that reported in general 
      population. Plasma NfL levels increased with age at onset (p < 0.05). Patients 
      with bulbar onset (BO) had higher plasma NfL concentration (CI -0.61 to -0.06, p 
      = 0.02) and a later age at onset of the disease (CI -24.78 to -4.93, p = 0.006) 
      with respect to the spinal onset (SO) form. Additionally, two of the patients, 
      with IAs and plasma NfL concentration lower with respect to normal alleles' 
      carriers, presented an age at onset higher than the mean of the entire cohort. 
      CONCLUSION: According to our findings, plasma NfL and IAs of HTT gene may 
      represent potential biomarkers in ALS, providing evidence of a possible 
      implication in clinical phenotype.

TI  - Oligonucleotides Targeting DNA Repeats Downregulate Huntingtin Gene Expression in 
      Huntington's Patient-Derived Neural Model System.
PG  - 443-456
LID - 10.1089/nat.2021.0021 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is one of the most common, dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative disorders. It affects the striatum, cerebral cortex, and other 
      subcortical structures leading to involuntary movement abnormalities, emotional 
      disturbances, and cognitive impairments. HD is caused by a CAG*CTG 
      trinucleotide-repeat expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene leading to 
      the formation of mutant HTT (mtHTT) protein aggregates. Besides the toxicity of 
      the mutated protein, there is also evidence that mtHTT transcripts contribute to 
      the disease. Thus, the reduction of both mutated mRNA and protein would be most 
      beneficial as a treatment. Previously, we designed a novel anti-gene 
      oligonucleotide (AGO)-based strategy directly targeting the HTT 
      trinucleotide-repeats in DNA and reported downregulation of mRNA and protein in 
      HD patient fibroblasts. In this study, we differentiate HD patient-derived 
      induced pluripotent stem cells to investigate the efficacy of the AGO, a 
      DNA/Locked Nucleic Acid mixmer with phosphorothioate backbone, to modulate HTT 
      transcription during neural in vitro development. For the first time, we 
      demonstrate downregulation of HTT mRNA following both naked and magnetofected 
      delivery into neural stem cells (NSCs) and show that neither emergence of neural 
      rosette structures nor self-renewal of NSCs is compromised. Furthermore, the 
      inhibition potency of both HTT mRNA and protein without off-target effects is 
      confirmed in neurons. These results further validate an anti-gene approach for 
      the treatment of HD.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in 
      the first exon of the huntingtin (HTT) gene coding for the huntingtin (HTT) 
      protein. The misfolding and consequential aggregation of CAG-expanded mutant HTT 
      (mHTT) underpin HD pathology. Our interest in the life cycle of HTT led us to 
      consider the development of high-affinity small-molecule binders of HTT 
      oligomerized/amyloid-containing species that could serve as either cellular and 
      in vivo imaging tools or potential therapeutic agents. We recently reported the 
      development of PET tracers CHDI-180 and CHDI-626 as suitable for imaging mHTT 
      aggregates, and here we present an in-depth pharmacological investigation of 
      their binding characteristics. We have implemented an array of in vitro and ex 
      vivo radiometric binding assays using recombinant HTT, brain homogenate-derived 
      HTT aggregates, and brain sections from mouse HD models and humans post-mortem to 
      investigate binding affinities and selectivity against other pathological 
      proteins from indications such as Alzheimer's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia 
      1. Radioligand binding assays and autoradiography studies using brain homogenates 
      and tissue sections from HD mouse models showed that CHDI-180 and CHDI-626 
      specifically bind mHTT aggregates that accumulate with age and disease 
      progression. Finally, we characterized CHDI-180 and CHDI-626 regarding their 
      off-target selectivity and binding affinity to beta amyloid plaques in brain 
      sections and homogenates from Alzheimer's disease patients.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by 
      progressive dementia, psychiatric problems, and chorea, is known to be caused by 
      CAG repeat expansions in the HD gene HTT. However, the mechanism of this 
      pathology is not fully understood. The translesion DNA polymerase theta (Poltheta) 
      carries a large insertion sequence in its catalytic domain, which has been shown 
      to allow DNA loop-outs in the primer strand. As a result of high levels of 
      oxidative DNA damage in neural cells and Poltheta's subsequent involvement in base 
      excision repair of oxidative DNA damage, we hypothesized that Poltheta contributes to 
      CAG repeat expansion while repairing oxidative damage within HTT. Here, we 
      performed Poltheta-catalyzed in vitro DNA synthesis using various CAG*CTG repeat DNA 
      substrates that are similar to base excision repair intermediates. We show that 
      Poltheta efficiently extends (CAG)(n)*(CTG)(n) hairpin primers, resulting in hairpin 
      retention and repeat expansion. Poltheta also triggers repeat expansions to pass the 
      threshold for HD when the DNA template contains 35 repeats upward. Strikingly, 
      Poltheta depleted of the catalytic insertion fails to induce repeat expansions 
      regardless of primers and templates used, indicating that the insertion sequence 
      is responsible for Poltheta's error-causing activity. In addition, the level of 
      chromatin-bound Poltheta in HD cells is significantly higher than in non-HD cells and 
      exactly correlates with the degree of CAG repeat expansion, implying Poltheta's 
      involvement in triplet repeat instability. Therefore, we have identified Poltheta as 
      a potent factor that promotes CAG*CTG repeat expansions in HD and other 
      neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene drives Huntington's disease (HD) 
      pathogenesis and is modulated by DNA damage repair pathways. In this context, the 
      interaction between FAN1, a DNA-structure-specific nuclease, and MLH1, member of 
      the DNA mismatch repair pathway (MMR), is not defined. Here, we identify a highly 
      conserved SPYF motif at the N terminus of FAN1 that binds to MLH1. Our data 
      support a model where FAN1 has two distinct functions to stabilize CAG repeats. 
      On one hand, it binds MLH1 to restrict its recruitment by MSH3, thus inhibiting 
      the assembly of a functional MMR complex that would otherwise promote CAG repeat 
      expansion. On the other hand, it promotes accurate repair via its nuclease 
      activity. These data highlight a potential avenue for HD therapeutics in 
      attenuating somatic expansion.

TI  - RNA Toxicity and Perturbation of rRNA Processing in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 
      2.
PG  - 2519-2529
LID - 10.1002/mds.28729 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in Ataxin-2 (ATXN2) gene. The mutant ATXN2 
      protein with a polyglutamine tract is known to be toxic and contributes to the 
      SCA2 pathogenesis. OBJECTIVE: Here, we tested the hypothesis that the mutant 
      ATXN2 transcript with an expanded CAG repeat (expATXN2) is also toxic and 
      contributes to SCA2 pathogenesis. METHODS: The toxic effect of expATXN2 
      transcripts on SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells and primary mouse cortical neurons was 
      evaluated by caspase 3/7 activity and nuclear condensation assay, respectively. 
      RNA immunoprecipitation assay was performed to identify RNA binding proteins 
      (RBPs) that bind to expATXN2 RNA. Quantitative PCR was used to examine if 
      ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing is disrupted in SCA2 and Huntington's disease 
      (HD) human brain tissue. RESULTS: expATXN2 RNA induces neuronal cell death, and 
      aberrantly interacts with RBPs involved in RNA metabolism. One of the RBPs, 
      transducin beta-like protein 3 (TBL3), involved in rRNA processing, binds to both 
      expATXN2 and expanded huntingtin (expHTT) RNA in vitro. rRNA processing is 
      disrupted in both SCA2 and HD human brain tissue. CONCLUSION: These findings 
      provide the first evidence of a contributory role of expATXN2 transcripts in SCA2 
      pathogenesis, and further support the role of expHTT transcripts in HD 
      pathogenesis. The disruption of rRNA processing, mediated by aberrant interaction 
      of RBPs with expATXN2 and expHTT transcripts, suggest a point of convergence in 
      the pathogeneses of repeat expansion diseases with potential therapeutic 
      implications. (c) 2021 The Authors. Movement Disorders published by Wiley

AB  - Neurodegenerative dementias are a group of diseases with highly heterogeneous 
      pathology and complicated etiology. There exist potential genetic component 
      overlaps between different neurodegenerative dementias. Here, 1795 patients with 
      neurodegenerative dementias from South China were enrolled, including 1592 with 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), 110 with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and 93 with 
      dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Genes targeted sequencing analysis were 
      performed. According to the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) 
      guidelines, 39 pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants were identified in 47 
      unrelated patients in 14 different genes, including PSEN1, PSEN2, APP, MAPT, GRN, 
      CHCHD10, TBK1, VCP, HTRA1, OPTN, SQSTM1, SIGMAR1, and abnormal repeat expansions 
      in C9orf72 and HTT. Overall, 33.3% (13/39) of the variants were novel, the 
      identified P/LP variants were seen in 2.2% (35/1592) and 10.9% (12/110) of AD and 
      FTD cases, respectively. The overall molecular diagnostic rate was 2.6%. Among 
      them, PSEN1 was the most frequently mutated gene (46.8%, 22/47), followed by 
      PSEN2 and APP. Additionally, the age at onset of patients with P/LP variants 
      (51.4 years), ranging from 30 to 83 years, was ~10 years earlier than those 
      without P/LP variants (p < 0.05). This study sheds insight into the genetic 
      spectrum and clinical manifestations of neurodegenerative dementias in South 
      China, further expands the existing repertoire of P/LP variants involved in known 
      dementia-associated genes. It provides a new perspective for basic research on 
      genetic pathogenesis and novel guiding for clinical practice of neurodegenerative 
      dementia.

LID - 10.1089/hum.2020.323 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating, autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. 
      Inactivation of the mutant allele by clustered regularly interspaced short 
      palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 based gene editing offers a possible 
      therapeutic approach for this disease, but permanent disruption of normal HTT 
      function might compromise adult neuronal function. Here, we use a novel HD mouse 
      model to examine allele-specific editing of mutant HTT (mHTT), with a BAC97 
      transgene expressing mHTT and a YAC18 transgene expressing normal HTT. We achieve 
      allele-specific inactivation of HTT by targeting a protein coding sequence 
      containing a common, heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The 
      outcome is a marked and allele-selective reduction of mHTT protein in a mouse 
      model of HD. Expression of a single CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease in neurons generated a 
      high frequency of mutations in the targeted HD allele that included both small 
      insertion/deletion (InDel) mutations and viral vector insertions. Thus, 
      allele-specific targeting of InDel and insertion mutations to heterozygous coding 
      region SNPs provides a feasible approach to inactivate autosomal dominant 
      mutations that cause genetic disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening for short tandem repeat (STR) expansions in next-generation 
      sequencing data can enable diagnosis, optimal clinical management/treatment, and 
      accurate genetic counseling of patients with repeat expansion disorders. We aimed 
      to develop an efficient computational workflow for reliable detection of STR 
      expansions in next-generation sequencing data and demonstrate its clinical 
      utility. METHODS: We characterized the performance of eight STR analysis methods 
      (lobSTR, HipSTR, RepeatSeq, ExpansionHunter, TREDPARSE, GangSTR, STRetch, and 
      exSTRa) on next-generation sequencing datasets of samples with known 
      disease-causing full-mutation STR expansions and genomes simulated to harbor 
      repeat expansions at selected loci and optimized their sensitivity. We then used 
      a machine learning decision tree classifier to identify an optimal combination of 
      methods for full-mutation detection. In Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)-aligned 
      genomes, the ensemble approach of using ExpansionHunter, STRetch, and exSTRa 
      performed the best (precision = 82%, recall = 100%, F1-score = 90%). We applied 
      this pipeline to screen 301 families of children with suspected genetic 
      disorders. RESULTS: We identified 10 individuals with full-mutations in the AR, 
      ATXN1, ATXN8, DMPK, FXN, or HTT disease STR locus in the analyzed families. 
      Additional candidates identified in our analysis include two probands with 
      borderline ATXN2 expansions between the established repeat size range for 
      reduced-penetrance and full-penetrance full-mutation and seven individuals with 
      FMR1 CGG repeats in the intermediate/premutation repeat size range. In 67 
      probands with a prior negative clinical PCR test for the FMR1, FXN, or DMPK 
      disease STR locus, or the spinocerebellar ataxia disease STR panel, our pipeline 
      did not falsely identify aberrant expansion. We performed clinical PCR tests on 
      seven (out of 10) full-mutation samples identified by our pipeline and confirmed 
      the expansion status in all, showing absolute concordance between our 
      bioinformatics and molecular findings. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully 
      demonstrated the application of a well-optimized bioinformatics pipeline that 
      promotes the utility of genome-wide sequencing as a first-tier screening test to 
      detect expansions of known disease STRs. Interrogating clinical next-generation 
      sequencing data for pathogenic STR expansions using our ensemble pipeline can 
      improve diagnostic yield and enhance clinical outcomes for patients with repeat 
      expansion disorders.

      frequency of falls and head trauma. SDH can cause serious disability, but there 
      is little information about the association of SDH with HD in the medical 
      literature. OBJECTIVE: To review the occurrence and characteristics of SDH seen 
      in clinics specializing in HD. METHODS: A retrospective review identifying the 
      occurrence and manifestations of SDH in HD patients attending three HDSA Centers 
      of Excellence. RESULTS: Twenty-five HD patients (16F/9M) were identified with 
      SDH. Twelve (44%) SDH were bilateral, 16 (60%) required surgical intervention, 
      and 2 resulted in death. Mean age at the time of SDH was 60 years, mean duration 
      of HD symptoms prior to event was 8 years, mean CAG repeat expansion size was 43 
      and mean UHDRS motor score obtained closest to time of SDH was 51 (16 patients). 
      Most SDH occurred in the context of ground level falls or using stairs although 5 
      patients had no history of head trauma. Additional brain injury may occur along 
      with the SDH. The most common symptoms were altered mental status, hemiparesis 
      and loss of consciousness. The over-representation of females in this study 
      requires replication and further investigation. CONCLUSION: Patients with HD are 
      at increased risk for SDH. An increased suspicion for SDH in HD patients should 
      be considered, as this phenomenon may be initially unrecognized, may require 
      extensive utilization of medical resources and is a potential cause of death.

TI  - FAN1-MLH1 interaction affects repair of DNA interstrand cross-links and 
      slipped-CAG/CTG repeats.
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.abf7906 [doi]
LID - eabf7906
AB  - FAN1, a DNA structure-specific nuclease, interacts with MLH1, but the repair 
      pathways in which this complex acts are unknown. FAN1 processes DNA interstrand 
      crosslinks (ICLs) and FAN1 variants are modifiers of the neurodegenerative 
      Huntington's disease (HD), presumably by regulating HD-causing CAG repeat 
      expansions. Here, we identify specific amino acid residues in two adjacent FAN1 
      motifs that are critical for MLH1 binding. Disruption of the FAN1-MLH1 
      interaction confers cellular hypersensitivity to ICL damage and defective repair 
      of CAG/CTG slip-outs, intermediates of repeat expansion mutations. FAN1-S126 
      phosphorylation, which hinders FAN1-MLH1 association, is cell cycle-regulated by 
      cyclin-dependent kinase activity and attenuated upon ICL induction. Our data 
      highlight the FAN1-MLH1 complex as a phosphorylation-regulated determinant of ICL 
      response and repeat stability, opening novel paths to modify cancer and 
      neurodegeneration.

TI  - Immortalized striatal precursor neurons from Huntington's disease patient-derived 
      iPS cells as a platform for target identification and screening for experimental 
      therapeutics.
PG  - 2469-2487
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddab200 [doi]
AB  - We have previously established induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of 
      Huntington's disease (HD), demonstrating CAG-repeat-expansion-dependent cell 
      biological changes and toxicity. However, the current differentiation protocols 
      are cumbersome and time consuming, making preparation of large quantities of 
      cells for biochemical or screening assays difficult. Here, we report the 
      generation of immortalized striatal precursor neurons (ISPNs) with normal (33) 
      and expanded (180) CAG repeats from HD iPSCs, differentiated to a phenotype 
      resembling medium spiny neurons (MSN), as a proof of principle for a more 
      tractable patient-derived cell model. For immortalization, we used co-expression 
      of the enzymatic component of telomerase hTERT and conditional expression of 
      c-Myc. ISPNs can be propagated as stable adherent cell lines, and rapidly 
      differentiated into highly homogeneous MSN-like cultures within 2 weeks, as 
      demonstrated by immunocytochemical criteria. Differentiated ISPNs recapitulate 
      major HD-related phenotypes of the parental iPSC model, including brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-withdrawal-induced cell death that can be rescued by 
      small molecules previously validated in the parental iPSC model. Proteome and 
      RNA-seq analyses demonstrate separation of HD versus control samples by principal 
      component analysis. We identified several networks, pathways, and upstream 
      regulators, also found altered in HD iPSCs, other HD models, and HD patient 
      samples. HD ISPN lines may be useful for studying HD-related cellular 
      pathogenesis, and for use as a platform for HD target identification and 
      screening experimental therapeutics. The described approach for generation of 
      ISPNs from differentiated patient-derived iPSCs could be applied to a larger 
      allelic series of HD cell lines, and to comparable modeling of other genetic 
      disorders.

TI  - The influence of sex, genotype, and dose on serum and hippocampal cytokine levels 
      in juvenile mice developmentally exposed to a human-relevant mixture of 
      polychlorinated biphenyls.
PG  - 85-103
LID - 10.1016/j.crtox.2020.09.001 [doi]
AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are pervasive environmental contaminants 
      implicated as risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Immune 
      dysregulation is another NDD risk factor, and developmental PCB exposures are 
      associated with early life immune dysregulation. Studies of the immunomodulatory 
      effects of PCBs have focused on the higher-chlorinated congeners found in legacy 
      commercial mixtures. Comparatively little is known about the immune effects of 
      contemporary, lower-chlorinated PCBs. This is a critical data gap given recent 
      reports that lower-chlorinated congeners comprise >70% of the total PCB burden in 
      serum of pregnant women enrolled in the MARBLES study who are at increased risk 
      for having a child with an NDD. To examine the influence of PCBs, sex, and 
      genotype on cytokine levels, mice were exposed throughout gestation and lactation 
      to a PCB mixture in the maternal diet, which was based on the 12 most abundant 
      PCBs in sera from MARBLES subjects. Using multiplex array, cytokines were 
      quantified in the serum and hippocampus of weanling mice expressing either a 
      human gain-of-function mutation in ryanodine receptor 1 (T4826I mice), a human 
      CGG premutation repeat expansion in the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 (CGG 
      mice), or both mutations (DM mice). Congenic wildtype (WT) mice were used as 
      controls. There were dose-dependent effects of PCB exposure on cytokine 
      concentrations in the serum but not hippocampus. Differential effects of genotype 
      were observed in the serum and hippocampus. Hippocampal cytokines were 
      consistently elevated in T4826I mice and also in WT animals for some cytokines 
      compared to CGG and DM mice, while serum cytokines were usually elevated in the 
      mutant genotypes compared to the WT group. Males had elevated levels of 19 
      cytokines in the serum and 4 in the hippocampus compared to females, but there 
      were also interactions between sex and genotype for 7 hippocampal cytokines. Only 
      the chemokine CCL5 in the serum showed an interaction between PCB dose, genotype, 
      and sex. Collectively, these findings indicate differential influences of PCB 
      exposure and genotype on cytokine levels in serum and hippocampal tissue of 
      weanling mice. These results suggest that developmental PCB exposure has chronic 
      effects on baseline serum, but not hippocampal, cytokine levels in juvenile mice.

AB  - Despite widespread clinical genetic testing, many individuals with suspected 
      genetic conditions lack a precise diagnosis, limiting their opportunity to take 
      advantage of state-of-the-art treatments. In some cases, testing reveals 
      difficult-to-evaluate structural differences, candidate variants that do not 
      fully explain the phenotype, single pathogenic variants in recessive disorders, 
      or no variants in genes of interest. Thus, there is a need for better tools to 
      identify a precise genetic diagnosis in individuals when conventional testing 
      approaches have been exhausted. We performed targeted long-read sequencing 
      (T-LRS) using adaptive sampling on the Oxford Nanopore platform on 40 
      individuals, 10 of whom lacked a complete molecular diagnosis. We computationally 
      targeted up to 151 Mbp of sequence per individual and searched for pathogenic 
      substitutions, structural variants, and methylation differences using a single 
      data source. We detected all genomic aberrations-including single-nucleotide 
      variants, copy number changes, repeat expansions, and methylation 
      differences-identified by prior clinical testing. In 8/8 individuals with complex 
      structural rearrangements, T-LRS enabled more precise resolution of the mutation, 
      leading to changes in clinical management in one case. In ten individuals with 
      suspected Mendelian conditions lacking a precise genetic diagnosis, T-LRS 
      identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in six and variants of 
      uncertain significance in two others. T-LRS accurately identifies pathogenic 
      structural variants, resolves complex rearrangements, and identifies Mendelian 
      variants not detected by other technologies. T-LRS represents an efficient and 
      cost-effective strategy to evaluate high-priority genes and regions or complex 
      clinical testing results.

TI  - Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) phenotype in fragile X premutation 
      carriers: case series.
PG  - 687-690
LID - 10.1136/jmedgenet-2020-107609 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While an association between full mutation CGG-repeat expansions of 
      the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene and connective tissue problems are 
      clearly described, problems in fragile X premutation carriers (fXPCs) CGG-repeat 
      range (55-200 repeats) of the FMR1 gene may be overlooked. OBJECTIVE: To report 
      five FMR1 fXPCs cases with the hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) 
      phenotype. METHODS: We collected medical histories and FMR1 molecular measures 
      from five cases who presented with joint hypermobility and loose connective 
      tissue and met inclusion criteria for hEDS. RESULTS: Five cases were female and 
      ranged between 16 and 49 years. The range of CGG-repeat allele sizes ranged from 
      66 to 150 repeats. All had symptoms of hEDS since early childhood. Commonalities 
      in molecular pathogenesis and coexisting conditions between the fXPCs and hEDS 
      are also presented. The premutation can lead to a reduction of fragile X mental 
      retardation protein, which is crucial in maintaining functions of the 
      extracellular matrix-related proteins, particularly matrix metallopeptidase 9 and 
      elastin. Moreover, elevated FMR1 messenger RNA causes sequestration of proteins, 
      which results in RNA toxicity. CONCLUSION: Both hEDS phenotype and premutation 
      involvement may co-occur because of related commonalities in pathogenesis.

AB  - GGGGCC (G(4)C(2)) hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the endosomal trafficking 
      gene C9orf72 are the most common genetic cause of ALS and frontotemporal 
      dementia. Repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation of this expansion through 
      near-cognate initiation codon usage and internal ribosomal entry generates toxic 
      proteins that accumulate in patients' brains and contribute to disease 
      pathogenesis. The helicase protein DEAH-box helicase 36 (DHX36-G4R1) plays active 
      roles in RNA and DNA G-quadruplex (G4) resolution in cells. As G(4)C(2) repeats 
      are known to form G4 structures in vitro, we sought to determine the impact of 
      manipulating DHX36 expression on repeat transcription and RAN translation. Using 
      a series of luciferase reporter assays both in cells and in vitro, we found that 
      DHX36 depletion suppresses RAN translation in a repeat length-dependent manner, 
      whereas overexpression of DHX36 enhances RAN translation from G(4)C(2) reporter 
      RNAs. Moreover, upregulation of RAN translation that is typically triggered by 
      integrated stress response activation is prevented by loss of DHX36. These 
      results suggest that DHX36 is active in regulating G(4)C(2) repeat translation, 
      providing potential implications for therapeutic development in nucleotide repeat 
      expansion disorders.

TI  - Respiratory dysfunction in a mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 7.
LID - 10.1242/dmm.048893 [doi]
LID - dmm048893
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of the ataxin-7 
      gene. Infantile-onset SCA7 patients display extremely large repeat expansions 
      (>200 CAGs) and exhibit progressive ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia and retinal 
      degeneration. Severe hypotonia, aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure 
      often contribute to death in affected infants. To better understand the features 
      of respiratory and upper airway dysfunction in SCA7, we examined breathing and 
      putative phrenic and hypoglossal neuropathology in a knock-in mouse model of 
      early-onset SCA7 carrying an expanded allele with 266 CAG repeats. Whole-body 
      plethysmography was used to measure awake spontaneously breathing SCA7-266Q 
      knock-in mice at baseline in normoxia and during a hypercapnic/hypoxic 
      respiratory challenge at 4 and 8 weeks, before and after the onset of disease. 
      Postmortem studies included quantification of putative phrenic and hypoglossal 
      motor neurons and microglia, and analysis of ataxin-7 aggregation at end stage. 
      SCA7-266Q mice had profound breathing deficits during a respiratory challenge, 
      exhibiting reduced respiratory output and a greater percentage of time in apnea. 
      Histologically, putative phrenic and hypoglossal motor neurons of SCA7 mice 
      exhibited a reduction in number accompanied by increased microglial activation, 
      indicating neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, intranuclear 
      ataxin-7 accumulation was observed in cells neighboring putative phrenic and 
      hypoglossal motor neurons in SCA7 mice. These findings reveal the importance of 
      phrenic and hypoglossal motor neuron pathology associated with respiratory 
      failure and upper airway dysfunction, which are observed in infantile-onset SCA7 
      patients and likely contribute to their early death.

AB  - CGG expansions between 55 and 200 in the 5'-untranslated region of the fragile-X 
      mental retardation gene (FMR1) increase the risk of developing the late-onset 
      debilitating neuromuscular disease Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome 
      (FXTAS). While the science behind this mutation, as a paradigm for RNA-mediated 
      nucleotide triplet repeat expansion diseases, has progressed rapidly, no 
      treatment has proven effective at delaying the onset or decreasing morbidity, 
      especially at later stages of the disease. Here, we demonstrated the beneficial 
      effect of the phytochemical sulforaphane (SFN), exerted through NRF2-dependent 
      and independent manner, on pathways relevant to brain function, bioenergetics, 
      unfolded protein response, proteosome, antioxidant defenses, and iron metabolism 
      in fibroblasts from FXTAS-affected subjects at all disease stages. This study 
      paves the way for future clinical studies with SFN in the treatment of FXTAS, 
      substantiated by the established use of this agent in clinical trials of diseases 
      with NRF2 dysregulation and in which age is the leading risk factor.

      Community-Based Cohort.
PG  - 2378-2386

AB  - BACKGROUND: Premutation-sized (55-200) CGG repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene 
      cause fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Most studies of 
      premutation carriers utilized reverse ascertainment to identify patients, leading 
      to a selection bias for larger repeats. As shorter CGG premutation repeats are 
      common in the population, understanding their impact on health outcomes has a 
      potentially large public health footprint. OBJECTIVE: The study's objective was 
      to compare an unselected group of premutation carriers (n = 35, 55-101 CGG 
      repeats) with matched controls (n = 61, 29-39 CGG repeats) with respect to 
      FXTAS-type signs using structured neurological assessments. METHODS: Three 
      neurologists independently rated signs, using an adapted version of the FXTAS 
      Rating Scale (Leehey MA, Berry-Kravis E, Goetz CG, et al. FMR1 CGG repeat length 
      predicts motor dysfunction in premutation carriers. Neurology. 2008). This was a 
      double-blind study, as genetic status (premutation vs. control) was known neither 
      by the participants nor by any of the neurologists. Analyses controlled 
      potentially confounding comorbid conditions in the electronic health record (eg, 
      osteoarthritis and stroke) and probed the association of age with signs. RESULTS: 
      Although there was no overall difference between carriers and controls, among 
      individuals without any potentially confounding comorbid diagnoses, there was a 
      statistically significant age-associated elevation in FXTAS-type signs in 
      premutation carriers compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Among those who do not 
      have other comorbid diagnoses, women who have CGG repeats at the lower end of the 
      premutation range may be at greater risk for ataxia and parkinsonism than their 
      age peers, although their overall risk of developing such clinical features is 
      low. This study should provide reassurance to those who share characteristics 
      with the present cohort. (c) 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder

AB  - Non-coding repeat expansions, such as CGG, GGC, CUG, CCUG, and GGGGCC, have been 
      shown to be involved in many human diseases, particularly neurological disorders. 
      Of the diverse pathogenic mechanisms proposed in these neurodegenerative 
      diseases, dysregulated RNA metabolism has emerged as an important contributor. 
      Expanded repeat RNAs that form particular structures aggregate to form RNA foci, 
      sequestering various RNA binding proteins and consequently altering RNA splicing, 
      transport, and other downstream biological processes. One of these repeat 
      expansion-associated diseases, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS), is caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the 5'UTR region of the fragile X 
      mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Moreover, recent studies have revealed abnormal 
      GGC repeat expansion within the 5'UTR region of the NOTCH2NLC gene in both 
      essential tremor (ET) and neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). These 
      CGG repeat expansion-associated diseases share genetic, pathological, and 
      clinical features. Identification of the similarities at the molecular level 
      could lead to a better understanding of the disease mechanisms as well as 
      developing novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we highlight our current 
      understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of CGG repeat expansion-associated 
      diseases and discuss potential therapeutic interventions for these neurological 
      disorders.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a dominant 
      CAG-repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Microglial activation is a key 
      feature of HD pathology, and is present before clinical disease onset. The 
      kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan degradation is activated in HD, and is 
      thought to contribute to disease progression. Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) 
      catalyzes the first step in this pathway; this and other pathway enzymes reside 
      with microglia. While HD brain microglia accumulate iron, the role of iron in 
      promoting microglial activation and KP activity is unclear. Here we utilized the 
      neonatal iron supplementation model to investigate the relationship between iron, 
      microglial activation and neurodegeneration in adult HD mice. We show in the 
      N171-82Q mouse model of HD microglial morphologic changes consistent with immune 
      activation. Neonatal iron supplementation in these mice promoted 
      neurodegeneration and resulted in additional microglial activation in adults as 
      determined by increased soma volume and decreased process length. We further 
      demonstrate that iron activates IDO, both in brain lysates and purified 
      recombinant protein (EC50 = 1.24 nM). Brain IDO activity is increased by HD. 
      Neonatal iron supplementation further promoted IDO activity in cerebral cortex, 
      altered KP metabolite profiles, and promoted HD neurodegeneration as measured by 
      brain weights and striatal volumes. Our results demonstrate that dietary iron is 
      an important activator of microglia and the KP pathway in this HD model, and that 
      this occurs in part through a direct effect on IDO. The findings are relevant to 
      understanding how iron promotes neurodegeneration in HD.

AB  - Our previous work has established a huntingtin knock-in (KI) pig model that 
      displays striatal neuronal loss, allowing us to examine if somatic CAG expansion 
      in striatum accounts for the preferential neurodegeneration in Huntington disease 
      (HD). We found that HD KI pigs do not display somatic CAG expansion in striatum 
      as HD KI mice and that the majority of polyQ repeats in exon 1 HTT in the 
      striatum of HD KI mice are fairly stable. We also found that striatal MSH2 and 
      MLH3, which are involved in DNA repair, are more abundant in mouse brains than 
      pig brains. Consistently inhibiting MSH2 and MLH3 reduced the somatic CAG 
      expansion in HD KI mouse striatum with no influence on neuropathology. Our 
      findings suggest that somatic CAG expansion is species-dependent, occurs in a 
      small fraction of the HD gene in mice, and does not critically contribute to HD 
      neuropathology.

TI  - Genetic Screen in Adult Drosophila Reveals That dCBP Depletion in Glial Cells 
      Mitigates Huntington Disease Pathology through a Foxo-Dependent Pathway.

LID - 3884
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive and fatal autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of 
      the huntingtin gene (HTT). In spite of considerable efforts, there is currently 
      no treatment to stop or delay the disease. Although HTT is expressed 
      ubiquitously, most of our knowledge has been obtained on neurons. More recently, 
      the impact of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) on other cell types, including glial 
      cells, has received growing interest. It is currently unclear whether new 
      pathological pathways could be identified in these cells compared to neurons. To 
      address this question, we performed an in vivo screen for modifiers of mutant 
      huntingtin (HTT-548-128Q) induced pathology in Drosophila adult glial cells and 
      identified several putative therapeutic targets. Among them, we discovered that 
      partial nej/dCBP depletion in these cells was protective, as revealed by strongly 
      increased lifespan and restored locomotor activity. Thus, dCBP promotes the HD 
      pathology in glial cells, in contrast to previous opposite findings in neurons. 
      Further investigations implicated the transcriptional activator Foxo as a 
      critical downstream player in this glial protective pathway. Our data suggest 
      that combinatorial approaches combined to specific tissue targeting may be 
      required to uncover efficient therapies in HD.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder, caused by 
      a CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion, that results in the aggregation of the 
      huntingtin protein, culminating in the deposition of inclusion bodies in HD 
      patient brains. We have previously shown that the heat shock response becomes 
      impaired with disease progression in mouse models of HD. The disruption of this 
      inducible arm of the proteostasis network is likely to exacerbate the 
      pathogenesis of this protein-folding disease. To allow a rapid and more 
      comprehensive analysis of the heat shock response, we have developed, and 
      validated, a 16-plex QuantiGene assay that allows the expression of Hsf1 and nine 
      heat shock genes, to be measured directly, and simultaneously, from mouse tissue. 
      We used this QuantiGene assay to show that, following pharmacological activation 
      in vivo, the heat shock response impairment in tibialis anterior, brain 
      hemispheres and striatum was comparable between zQ175 and R6/2 mice. In contrast, 
      although a heat shock impairment could be detected in R6/2 cortex, this was not 
      apparent in the cortex from zQ175 mice. Whilst the mechanism underlying this

AB  - Transcribed nucleotide repeat expansions form detectable RNA foci in patient 
      cells that contribute to disease pathogenesis. The most widely used method for 
      detecting RNA foci, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), is powerful but 
      can suffer from issues related to signal above background. Here we developed a 
      repeat-specific form of hybridization chain reaction (R-HCR) as an alternative 
      method for detection of repeat RNA foci in two neurodegenerative disorders: 
      C9orf72 associated ALS and frontotemporal dementia (C9 ALS/FTD) and Fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. R-HCR to both G(4)C(2) and CGG repeats 
      exhibited comparable specificity but > 40 x sensitivity compared to FISH, with 
      better detection of both nuclear and cytoplasmic foci in human C9 ALS/FTD 
      fibroblasts, patient iPSC derived neurons, and patient brain samples. Using 
      R-HCR, we observed that integrated stress response (ISR) activation significantly 
      increased the number of endogenous G(4)C(2) repeat RNA foci and triggered their 
      selective nuclear accumulation without evidence of stress granule co-localization 
      in patient fibroblasts and patient derived neurons. These data suggest that R-HCR 
      can be a useful tool for tracking the behavior of repeat expansion mRNA in C9 
      ALS/FTD and other repeat expansion disorders.

AB  - Junctophilin-3 belongs to a triprotein junctional complex implicated in the 
      regulation of neuronal excitability and involved in the formation of junctional 
      membrane structures between voltage-gated ion channels and endoplasmic 
      (ryanodine) reticular receptors. A monoallelic trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      located within the junctophilin-3 gene (JPH3) has been implicated in a rare 
      autosomal dominant (AD) late-onset (and progressive) disorder clinically 
      resembling Huntington disease (HD), and known as HD-like 2 (HDL2; MIM# 606438). 
      Although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying HDL2 has not yet been fully 
      elucidated, toxic gain-of-function of the aberrant transcript (containing the 
      trinucleotide repeat) and loss of expression of (full-length) junctophilin-3 have 
      both been implicated in HDL2 pathophysiology. In this study, we identified by 
      whole exome sequencing (WES) a JPH3 homozygous truncating variant [NM_020655.4: 
      c.17405dup; p.(Val581Argfs*137)]. in a female individual affected with 
      genetically undetermined neurodevelopmental anomalies (including delayed motor 
      milestones, abnormal social communication, language difficulties and borderline 
      cognitive impairment) and paroxysmal attacks of dystonia since her early infancy. 
      Our study expands the JPH3-associated mutational spectrum and clinical 
      phenotypes, implicating the loss of Junctophilin-3 in heterogeneous 
      neurodevelopmental phenotypes and early-onset paroxysmal movement disorders.

LID - 10.1038/s41431-021-00832-x [doi]
AB  - HEAT repeats are 37-47 amino acid flexible tandem repeat structural motifs 
      occurring in a wide variety of eukaryotic proteins with diverse functions. Due to 
      their ability to undergo elastic conformational changes, they often serve as 
      scaffolds at sites of protein interactions. Here, we describe four affected 
      children from two families presenting with pontocerebellar hypoplasia manifest 
      clinically with neonatal seizures, severe intellectual disability, and motor 
      delay. Whole exome sequencing identified biallelic variants at predicted splice 
      sites in intron 31 of HEATR5B, encoding the HEAT repeat-containing protein 5B 
      segregating in a recessive fashion. Aberrant splicing was found in patient 
      fibroblasts, which correlated with reduced levels of HEATR5B protein. HEATR5B is 
      expressed during brain development in human, and we failed to recover live-born 
      homozygous Heatr5b knockout mice. Taken together, our results implicate loss of 
      HEATR5B in pontocerebellar hypoplasia.

AB  - Virtually all genome sequencing efforts in national biobanks, complex and 
      Mendelian disease programs, and medical genetic initiatives are reliant upon 
      short-read whole-genome sequencing (srWGS), which presents challenges for the 
      detection of structural variants (SVs) relative to emerging long-read WGS (lrWGS) 
      technologies. Given this ubiquity of srWGS in large-scale genomics initiatives, 
      we sought to establish expectations for routine SV detection from this data type 
      by comparison with lrWGS assembly, as well as to quantify the genomic properties 
      and added value of SVs uniquely accessible to each technology. Analyses from the 
      Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC) of three families captured 
      ~11,000 SVs per genome from srWGS and ~25,000 SVs per genome from lrWGS assembly. 
      Detection power and precision for SV discovery varied dramatically by genomic 
      context and variant class: 9.7% of the current GRCh38 reference is defined by 
      segmental duplication (SD) and simple repeat (SR), yet 91.4% of deletions that 
      were specifically discovered by lrWGS localized to these regions. Across the 
      remaining 90.3% of reference sequence, we observed extremely high (93.8%) 
      concordance between technologies for deletions in these datasets. In contrast, 
      lrWGS was superior for detection of insertions across all genomic contexts. Given 
      that non-SD/SR sequences encompass 95.9% of currently annotated 
      disease-associated exons, improved sensitivity from lrWGS to discover novel 
      pathogenic deletions in these currently interpretable genomic regions is likely 
      to be incremental. However, these analyses highlight the considerable added value 
      of assembly-based lrWGS to create new catalogs of insertions and transposable 
      elements, as well as disease-associated repeat expansions in genomic sequences 
      that were previously recalcitrant to routine assessment.

AB  - Somatic expansion of the CAG repeat tract that causes Huntington's disease (HD) 
      is thought to contribute to the rate of disease pathogenesis. Therefore, factors 
      influencing repeat expansion are potential therapeutic targets. Genes in the DNA 
      mismatch repair pathway are critical drivers of somatic expansion in HD mouse 
      models. Here, we have tested, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, the 
      role of the endonuclease domain of the mismatch repair protein MLH3 in somatic 
      CAG expansion in HD mice and patient cells. A point mutation in the MLH3 
      endonuclease domain completely eliminated CAG expansion in the brain and 
      peripheral tissues of a HD knock-in mouse model (HttQ111). To test whether the 
      MLH3 endonuclease could be manipulated pharmacologically, we delivered splice 
      switching oligonucleotides in mice to redirect Mlh3 splicing to exclude the 
      endonuclease domain. Splice redirection to an isoform lacking the endonuclease 
      domain was associated with reduced CAG expansion. Finally, CAG expansion in HD 
      patient-derived primary fibroblasts was also significantly reduced by redirecting 
      MLH3 splicing to the endogenous endonuclease domain-lacking isoform. These data 
      indicate the potential of targeting the MLH3 endonuclease domain to slow somatic 
      CAG repeat expansion in HD, a therapeutic strategy that may be applicable across 
      multiple repeat expansion disorders.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in exon 1 of huntingtin (HTT). While there are currently no 
      disease-modifying treatments for HD, recent efforts have focused on 
      the development of nucleotide-based therapeutics to lower HTT expression. As an 
      alternative to siRNA or oligonucleotide methods, we hypothesized that suppression 
      of HTT expression might be accomplished by small molecules that either (1) 
      directly decrease HTT expression by suppressing HTT promoter activity or (2) 
      indirectly decrease HTT expression by increasing the promoter activity of HTT-AS, 
      the gene antisense to HTT that appears to inhibit expression of HTT. We developed 
      and employed a high-throughput screen for modifiers of HTT and HTT-AS promoter 
      activity using luminescent reporter HEK293 cells; of the 52,041 compounds tested, 
      we identified 898 replicable hits. We used a rigorous stepwise approach to assess 
      compound toxicity and the capacity of the compounds to specifically lower 
      huntingtin protein in 5 different cell lines, including HEK293 cells, HD 
      lymphoblastoid cells, mouse primary neurons, HD iPSCs differentiated into 
      cortical-like neurons, and HD hESCs. We found no compounds which were able to 
      lower huntingtin without lowering cell viability in all assays, though the 
      potential efficacy of a few compounds at non-toxic doses could not be excluded. 
      Our results suggest that more specific targets may facilitate a small molecule 
      approach to HTT suppression.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited, progressively debilitating disorder 
      marked by prominent degeneration in striatal and cortical brain regions. HD is 
      caused by (CAG)(n) repeat expansion in huntingtin (HTT) gene that translates into 
      a mutant form of the ubiquitously present Huntingtin (HTT) protein. Extensive 
      metabolic dysfunction coexisting with overt neuropathies has been evidenced in 
      clinical and experimental settings of HD. Body weight loss despite normal to high 
      caloric intake remains a critical determinant of the disease progression and a 
      challenge for therapeutic interventions. In the present study, we intended to 
      monitor the cellular and molecular perturbations in Drosophila, caused by 
      pan-neuronal expression of mHTT (mutant Huntingtin) protein. We found aberrant 
      transcription profile of key lipolytic and lipogenic genes in whole-body of the 
      fly with disease progression. Interestingly, fatbody undergoes extensive 
      alteration of vital cellular processes and eventually surrenders to increased 
      apoptotic cell death in terminal stage of the disease. Extensive mitochondrial 
      dysfunction from early disease stage along with calcium derangement at terminal 
      stage were observed in fatbody, which contribute to its deteriorating integrity. 
      All the mechanisms were monitored progressively, at different disease stages, and 
      many alterations were documented in the early stage itself. Our study hence 
      provides insight into the mechanisms through which neuronal expression of mHTT 
      might be inflicting the profound systemic effects, specifically on lipid 
      metabolism, and may open new therapeutic avenues for alleviation of the 
      multidimensional disease.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion of the huntingtin gene (HTT) that 
      affects 1 in every 10 000 individuals in the United States. Our lab developed a 
      novel immune deficient HD mouse strain, the YACNSG, from a commonly used line, 
      the YAC128 mouse, to enable transplantation studies using engineered human cells 
      in addition to studying the impact of the immune system on disease progression. 
      The primary goal of this project was to characterize this novel immune deQficient 
      HD mouse model, using behavioral assays and histology to compare this new model 
      to the immune competent YAC128 and immune deficient mice that had engraftment of 
      a human immune system. Flow cytometry was used to confirm that the YACNSG strain 
      lacked immune cells, and in vivo imaging was used to assess human mesenchymal 
      stem/stromal cell (MSC) retention compared with a commonly used immune deficient 
      line, the NSG mouse. We found that YACNSG were able to retain human MSCs longer 
      than the immune competent YAC128 mice. We performed behavioral assessments 
      starting at 4 months of age and continued testing monthly until 12 months on the 
      accelerod and in the open field. At 12 months, brains were isolated and evaluated 
      using immunohistochemistry for striatal volume. Results from these studies 
      suggest that the novel immune deficient YACNSG strain of mice could provide a 
      good model for human stem-cell based therapies and that the immune system appears 
      to play an important role in the pathology of HD.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by an 
      abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene coding for a protein with an 
      elongated polyglutamine sequence. HD patients present choreiform movements, which 
      are caused by the loss of neurons in the striatum and cerebral cortex. Previous 
      reports indicate that the absence of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) protects 
      mice from excitotoxic insults and increases the transcription of neurotrophic 
      factors. Based on these data, we evaluated the effects of the lack of the AhR on 
      a mice model of HD, generating a double transgenic mouse, expressing human 
      mutated huntingtin (R6/1 mice) and knockout for the AhR. Our results show that 
      the body weight of 30-week-old double transgenic mice is similar to that of R6/1 
      mice; however, feet clasping, an indicative of neuronal damage in the R6/1 
      animals, was not observed. In addition, motor coordination and ambulatory 
      behavior in double transgenic mice did not deteriorate over time as occur in the 
      R6/1 mice. Moreover, the anxiety behavior of double transgenic mice was similar 
      to wild type mice. Interestingly, astrogliosis is also reduced in the double 
      transgenic mice. The present data demonstrate that the complete loss of the AhR 
      reduces the motor and behavioral deterioration observed in R6/1 mice, suggesting 
      that the pharmacological modulation of the AhR could be a therapeutic target in 
      HD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a genetically inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder that classically involves a trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion on 
      chromosome 4, with 36 repeats or greater being disease identifying. It generally 
      presents between the age of 30 and 40 years old and is characterised by severe 
      caudate/striatum degeneration with huntingtin protein aggregation. We present 
      here the case of a patient in her early 80s who presented with 5-year history of 
      worsening chorea and family history of HD but an intermediate length CAG 
      expansion. METHODS: Genetic testing of CAG repeats on chromosome 4. Postmortem 
      brain tissue was obtained and stained using immunohistochemistry for 
      amyloid-beta, tau and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Sections from the 
      caudate/putamen were also analysed by p62 immunofluorescence. All sections were 
      reviewed by trained neuropathologists. RESULTS: On genetic testing the patient 
      was found to have a 28 CAG repeat on the longest expansion. Microscopic analysis 
      revealed significant neuronal atrophy in the caudate and putamen with gliosis. 
      Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated minimal intranuclear p62 inclusions 
      suggesting little huntingtin aggregation present. Furthermore, there was 
      significant amyloid-beta pathology (Thal-IV stage) and tau involvement in the 
      medial temporal lobe (Braak stage II). CONCLUSION: This case provides clinical 
      and pathological evidence to support an emerging clinical entity involving HD 
      presentation in late age with an intermediate CAG repeat.

TI  - Small Non-coding RNAs Are Dysregulated in Huntington's Disease Transgenic Mice 
      Independently of the Therapeutic Effects of an Environmental Intervention.
PG  - 3308-3318
LID - 10.1007/s12035-021-02342-9 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Transcriptomic 
      dysregulations are well-documented in HD and alterations in small non-coding RNAs 
      (sncRNAs), particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), could underpin that phenomenon. 
      Additionally, environmental enrichment (EE), which is used to model a stimulating 
      lifestyle in pre-clinical research, has been shown to ameliorate HD-related 
      symptoms. However, the mechanisms mediating the therapeutic effects of EE remain 
      largely unknown. This study assessed the effect of EE on sncRNA expression in the 
      striatum of female R6/1 transgenic HD mice at 12 weeks (prior to over motor 
      deficits) and 20 weeks (fully symptomatic) of age. When comparing wild-type and 
      R6/1 mice in the standard housing condition, we found 6 and 64 miRNAs that were 
      differentially expressed at 12 and 20 weeks of age, respectively. The 6 miRNAs 
      (miR-132, miR-212, miR-222, miR-1a, miR-467a, and miR-669c) were commonly 
      dysregulated at both time points. Additionally, genotype had minor effects on the 
      levels of other sncRNAs, in particular, 1 piRNA was dysregulated at 12 weeks of 
      age, and at 20 weeks of age 11 piRNAs, 1 tRNA- and 2 snoRNA-derived fragments 
      were altered in HD mice. No difference in the abundance of other sncRNA subtypes, 
      including rRNA- and snRNA- derived fragments, were observed. While EE improved 
      locomotor symptoms in HD, we found no effect of the housing condition on any of 
      the sncRNA populations examined. Our findings show that HD mainly affects miRNAs 
      and has a minor effect on other sncRNA populations. Furthermore, the therapeutic 
      effects of EE are not associated with the rescue of these dysregulated sncRNAs 
      and may therefore exert these experience-dependent effects via other molecular 
      mechanisms.

TI  - CAG repeat instability in embryonic stem cells and derivative spermatogenic cells 
      of transgenic Huntington's disease monkey.
PG  - 1215-1229

AB  - PURPOSE: The expansion of CAG (glutamine; Q) trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) 
      predominantly occurs through male lineage in Huntington's disease (HD). As a 
      result, offspring will have larger CAG repeats compared to their fathers, which 
      causes an earlier onset of the disease called genetic anticipation. This study 
      aims to develop a novel in vitro model to replicate CAG repeat instability in 
      early spermatogenesis and demonstrate the biological process of genetic 
      anticipation by using the HD stem cell model for the first time. METHODS: HD 
      rhesus monkey embryonic stem cells (rESCs) were cultured in vitro for an extended 
      period. Male rESCs were used to derive spermatogenic cells in vitro with a 10-day 
      differentiation. The assessment of CAG repeat instability was performed by 
      GeneScan and curve fit analysis. RESULTS: Spermatogenic cells derived from rESCs 
      exhibit progressive expansion of CAG repeats with high daily expansion rates 
      compared to the extended culture of rESCs. The expansion of CAG repeats is cell 
      type-specific and size-dependent. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we report a novel stem cell 
      model that replicates genome instability and CAG repeat expansion in in vitro 
      derived HD monkey spermatogenic cells. The in vitro spermatogenic cell model 
      opens a new opportunity for studying TNR instability and the underlying mechanism 
      of genetic anticipation, not only in HD but also in other TNR diseases.

TI  - An imaging mass spectrometry atlas of lipids in the human neurologically normal 
      and Huntington's disease caudate nucleus.
PG  - 2158-2172

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal disorder associated with germline 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions in the HTT gene and characterised by striatal 
      neurodegeneration. No efficacious interventions are available for HD, 
      highlighting a major unmet medical need. The molecular mechanisms underlying HD 
      are incompletely understood despite its monogenic aetiology. However, direct 
      interactions between HTT and membrane lipids suggest that lipidomic perturbations 
      may be implicated in the neuropathology of HD. In this study, we employed 
      matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) 
      to generate a comprehensive, unbiased and spatially resolved lipidomic atlas of 
      the caudate nucleus (CN) in human post-mortem tissue from neurologically normal 
      (n = 10) and HD (n = 13) subjects. Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass 
      spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were used for 
      lipid assignment. Lipidomic specialisation was observed in the grey and white 
      matter constituents of the CN and these features were highly conserved between 
      subjects. While the majority of lipid species were highly conserved in HD, 
      compared to age-matched controls, CN specimens from HD cases in our cohort 
      spanning a range of neuropathological grades showed a lower focal abundance of 
      the neuroprotective docosahexaenoic and adrenic acids, several cardiolipins, the 
      ganglioside GM1 and glycerophospholipids with long polyunsaturated fatty acyls. 
      HD cases showed a higher focal abundance of several sphingomyelins and 
      glycerophospholipids with shorter monosaturated fatty acyls. Moreover, we 
      demonstrate that MALDI-IMS is tractable as a primary discovery modality comparing 
      heterogeneous human brain tissue, provided that appropriate statistical 
      approaches are adopted. Our findings support further investigation into the 
      potential role of lipidomic aberrations in HD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent advances in therapeutic options may prevent deterioration 
      related to Huntington's disease (HD), even at the pre-symptomatic stage. Be that 
      as it may, a well-characterized patient population is essential for screening and 
      monitoring outcome. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to describe the 
      characteristics of a Hungarian subpopulation of HD patients and mutation carriers 
      diagnosed at the University of Szeged. METHODS: We conducted a search for 
      International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code G10H0 in the local medical 
      database for the period of 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2018. RESULTS: We 
      identified 90 HD cases (male: 45, female: 45) and 34 asymptomatic carriers (male: 
      15, female: 19). The median age of onset was 45 years (range: 16-79). There were 
      3 cases of juvenile onset (3.3%), and 7 of late disease onset (7.8%). The median 
      repeat length was 43 (range: 36-70) for the pathological and 19 for the 
      non-pathological alleles (range: 9-35). 17.5% of the pathological alleles were in 
      the decreased penetrance range, while 7% of non-pathological alleles were 
      intermediate. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic and clinical features of the population 
      examined in the present study were in line with the previous Hungarian study, as 
      well as with international literature. The exceptions were the higher ratio of 
      reduced penetrance and intermediate alleles.

LID - 600840
AB  - Background: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is an adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder associated with premutation CGG-repeat expansions 
      (55-200 repeats) in the 5' non-coding portion of the fragile X mental retardation 
      1 (FMR1) gene. Core features of FXTAS include progressive tremor/ataxia, 
      cognitive decline, variable brain volume loss, and white matter disease. The 
      principal histopathological feature of FXTAS is the presence of central nervous 
      system (CNS) and non-CNS intranuclear inclusions. Objective: To further elucidate 
      the molecular underpinnings of FXTAS through the proteomic characterization of 
      human FXTAS cortexes. Results: Proteomic analysis of FXTAS brain cortical tissue 
      (n = 8) identified minor differences in protein abundance compared to control 
      brains (n = 6). Significant differences in FXTAS relative to control brain 
      predominantly involved decreased abundance of proteins, with the greatest 
      decreases observed for tenascin-C (TNC), cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38), 
      and phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1); proteins typically increased in 
      other neurodegenerative diseases. Proteins with the greatest increased abundance 
      include potentially novel neurodegeneration-related proteins and small 
      ubiquitin-like modifier 1/2 (SUMO1/2). The FMRpolyG peptide, proposed in models 
      of FXTAS pathogenesis but only identified in trace amounts in the earlier study 
      of FXTAS inclusions, was not identified in any of the FXTAS or control brains in 
      the current study. Discussion: The observed proteomic shifts, while generally 
      relatively modest, do show a bias toward decreased protein abundance with FXTAS. 
      Such shifts in protein abundance also suggest altered RNA binding as well as loss 
      of cell-cell adhesion/structural integrity. Unlike other neurodegenerative 
      diseases, the proteome of end-stage FXTAS does not suggest a strong 
      inflammation-mediated degenerative response.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by the expansion of the HTT CAG repeat. Affected individuals 
      inherit >/=36 repeats and longer alleles cause earlier onset, greater disease 
      severity and faster disease progression. The HTT CAG repeat is genetically 
      unstable in the soma in a process that preferentially generates somatic 
      expansions, the proportion of which is associated with disease onset, severity 
      and progression. Somatic mosaicism of the HTT CAG repeat has traditionally been 
      assessed by semi-quantitative PCR-electrophoresis approaches that have 
      limitations (e.g., no information about sequence variants). 
      Genotyping-by-sequencing could allow for some of these limitations to be 
      overcome. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the utility of PCR sequencing to genotype 
      large (>50 CAGs) HD alleles and to quantify the associated somatic mosaicism. 
      METHODS: We have applied MiSeq and PacBio sequencing to PCR products of the HTT 
      CAG repeat in transgenic R6/2 mice carrying  approximately 55,  approximately 110,  approximately 255 and  approximately 470 CAGs. For 
      each of these alleles, we compared the repeat length distributions generated for 
      different tissues at two ages. RESULTS: We were able to sequence the CAG repeat 
      full length in all samples. However, the repeat length distributions for samples 
      with  approximately 470 CAGs were biased towards shorter repeat lengths. CONCLUSION: PCR 
      sequencing can be used to sequence all the HD alleles considered, but this 
      approach cannot be used to estimate modal allele size or quantify somatic 
      expansions for alleles ...250 CAGs. We review the limitations of PCR sequencing and 
      alternative approaches that may allow the quantification of somatic contractions 
      and very large somatic expansions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Establishing the diagnosis of Huntington's disease (HD) involves 
      molecular genetic testing and estimation of the number of CAG repeats. MATERIAL 
      AND METHODS: We report a 42-year-old patient with clinical phenotype suggestive 
      of HD, who was repeatedly negative on genetic testing for HD at a reference 
      laboratory. He had positive history of similar symptoms in his father, but not in 
      other family members. During a 2-year follow-up his symptoms slowly deteriorated 
      (videos attached). The family history was misleading, as we discovered that 
      patient's father was adopted as infant. Having excluded HD-like disorders and 
      other causes of the symptoms we hypothesized that the primer could not bind to 
      the mutated allele. RESULTS: The PCR reaction with primers HD1 and Hu3 revealed 
      homozygosity of the other adjacent microsatellite tract consisting of the CCG 
      repeats. The newly designed set of primers, located outside of the CAG tract 
      (HD6extF, HD7extR) was used and enabled amplification of the mutant allele and 
      detection of the abnormal range of CAG repeats. CONCLUSIONS: As application of 
      the novel primers led to the diagnosis of HD in other 5 patients previously 
      tested negative, we propose their incorporation into routine genetic testing in 
      patients suspected of HD displaying homoallelism in the standard protocol.

AB  - The expanded CAG repeat number in HTT gene causes Huntington disease (HD), which 
      is a severe, dominant neurodegenerative illness. The accurate determination of 
      the expanded allele size is crucial to confirm the genetic status in symptomatic 
      and presymptomatic at-risk subjects and avoid genetic polymorphism-related 
      false-negative diagnoses. Precise CAG repeat number determination is critical to 
      discriminate the cutoff between unexpanded and intermediate mutable alleles (IAs, 
      27-35 CAG) as well as between IAs and pathological, low-penetrance alleles (i.e., 
      36-39 CAG repeats), and it is also critical to detect large repeat expansions 
      causing pediatric HD variants. We analyzed the HTT-CAG repeat number of 14 DNA 
      reference materials and of a DNA collection of 43 additional samples carrying 
      unexpanded, IAs, low and complete penetrance alleles, including large (>60 
      repeats) and very large (>100 repeats) expansions using a novel triplet-primed 
      PCR-based assay, the AmplideX PCR/CE HTT Kit. The results demonstrate that the 
      method accurately genotypes both normal and expanded HTT-CAG repeat numbers and 
      reveals previously undisclosed and very large CAG expansions >200 repeats. We 
      also show that this technique can improve genetic test reliability and accuracy 
      by detecting CAG expansions in samples with sequence variations within or 
      adjacent to the repeat tract that cause allele drop-outs or inaccuracies using 
      other PCR methods.

AB  - Synaptic structure and function are compromised prior to cell death and symptom 
      onset in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. In Huntington disease (HD), a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the gene encoding the huntingtin protein results in a 
      presymptomatic stage that typically spans multiple decades and is followed by 
      striking degeneration of striatal tissue and the progression of debilitating 
      motor symptoms. Many lines of evidence demonstrate that the HD presymptomatic 
      window is associated with injurious effects to striatal synapses, many of which 
      appear to be prerequisites to subsequent cell death. While the striatum is the 
      most vulnerable region in the HD brain, it is widely recognized that HD is a 
      brain-wide disease, affecting numerous extrastriatal regions that contribute to 
      debilitating non-motor symptoms including cognitive dysfunction. Currently, we 
      have a poor understanding of the synaptic integrity, or lack thereof, in 
      extrastriatal regions in the presymptomatic HD brain. If early therapeutic 
      intervention seeks to maintain healthy synaptic function, it is important to 
      understand early HD-associated synaptopathy at a brain-wide, rather than 
      striatal-exclusive, level. Here, we focused on the hippocampus as this structure 
      is generally thought to be affected only in manifest HD despite the subtle 
      cognitive deficits known to emerge in prodromal HD. We used super-resolution 
      microscopy and multi-electrode array electrophysiology as sensitive measures of 
      excitatory synapse structure and function, respectively, in the hippocampus of 
      presymptomatic heterozygous HD mice (Q175FDN model). We found clear evidence for 
      enhanced AMPA receptor subunit clustering and hyperexcitability well before the 
      onset of a detectable HD-like behavioral phenotype. In addition, 
      activity-dependent re-organization of synaptic protein nanostructure, and 
      functional measures of synaptic plasticity were impaired in presymptomatic HD 
      mice. These data demonstrate that synaptic abnormalities in the presymptomatic HD 
      brain are not exclusive to the striatum, and highlight the need to better 
      understand the region-dependent complexities of early synaptopathy in the HD 
      brain.

AB  - Progressive motor alterations and selective death of striatal medium spiny 
      neurons (MSNs) are key pathological hallmarks of Huntington's disease (HD), a 
      neurodegenerative condition caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 
      coding region of the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Most research has focused on the 
      pathogenic effects of the resultant protein product(s); however, growing evidence 
      indicates that expanded CAG repeats within mutant HTT mRNA and derived small CAG 
      repeat RNAs (sCAG) participate in HD pathophysiology. The individual contribution 
      of protein versus RNA toxicity to HD pathophysiology remains largely 
      uncharacterized and the role of other classes of small RNAs (sRNA) that are 
      strongly perturbed in HD is uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that sRNA produced in 
      the putamen of HD patients (HD-sRNA-PT) are sufficient to induce HD pathology in 
      vivo. Mice injected with HD-sRNA-PT show motor abnormalities, decreased levels of 
      striatal HD-related proteins, disruption of the indirect pathway, and strong 
      transcriptional abnormalities, paralleling human HD pathology. Importantly, we 
      show that the specific blockage of sCAG mitigates HD-sRNA-PT neurotoxicity only 
      to a limited extent. This observation prompted us to identify other sRNA species 
      enriched in HD putamen with neurotoxic potential. We detected high levels of tRNA 
      fragments (tRFs) in HD putamen, and we validated the neurotoxic potential of an 
      Alanine derived tRF in vitro. These results highlight that HD-sRNA-PT are 
      neurotoxic, and suggest that multiple sRNA species contribute to striatal 
      dysfunction and general transcriptomic changes, favoring therapeutic strategies 
      based on the blockage of sRNA-mediated toxicity.

TI  - Developmental malformations in Huntington disease: neuropathologic evidence of 
      focal neuronal migration defects in a subset of adult brains.
PG  - 399-413

AB  - Neuropathologic hallmarks of Huntington Disease (HD) include the progressive 
      neurodegeneration of the striatum and the presence of Huntingtin (HTT) aggregates 
      that result from abnormal polyQ expansion of the HTT gene. Whether the pathogenic 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion of the HTT gene causes neurodevelopmental 
      abnormalities has garnered attention in both murine and human studies; however, 
      documentation of discrete malformations in autopsy brains of HD individuals has 
      yet to be described. We retrospectively searched the New York Brain Bank 
      (discovery cohort) and an independent cohort (validation cohort) to determine 
      whether developmental malformations are more frequently detected in HD versus 
      non-HD brains and to document their neuropathologic features. One-hundred and 
      thirty HD and 1600 non-HD whole brains were included in the discovery cohort and 
      720 HD and 1989 non-HD half brains were assessed in the validation cohort. Cases 
      with developmental malformations were found at 6.4-8.2 times greater frequency in 
      HD than in non-HD brains (discovery cohort: OR 8.68, 95% CI 3.48-21.63, 
      P=4.8 x 10(-5); validation cohort: OR 6.50, 95% CI 1.83-23.17, P=0.0050). 
      Periventricular nodular heterotopias (PNH) were the most frequent malformations 
      and contained HTT and p62 aggregates analogous to the cortex, whereas cortical 
      malformations with immature neuronal populations did not harbor such inclusions. 
      HD individuals with malformations had heterozygous HTT CAG expansions between 40 
      and 52 repeats, were more frequently women, and all were asymmetric and focal, 
      aside from one midline hypothalamic hamartoma. Using two independent brain bank 
      cohorts, this large neuropathologic series demonstrates an increased occurrence 
      of developmental malformations in HD brains. Since pathogenic HTT gene expansion 
      is associated with genomic instability, one possible explanation is that neuronal 
      precursors are more susceptible to somatic mutation of genes involved in cortical 
      migration. Our findings further support emerging evidence that pathogenic 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions of the HTT gene may impact neurodevelopment.

PG  - e538

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the population of subjects seeking presymptomatic 
      counseling for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and/or frontotemporal dementia 
      (ALS/FTD) and compared them with those demanding the well-established 
      presymptomatic test for Huntington disease (HD). METHODS: We retrospectively 
      examined the requests of a cohort of individuals at risk of familial ALS/FTD and 
      1 at risk of HD over the same time frame of 11 years. The individuals were seen 
      in the referral center of our neurogenetics unit. RESULTS: Of the 106 
      presymptomatic testing (PT) requests from subjects at risk of ALS/FTD, 65% were 
      seen in the last 3 years. Over two-thirds of the subjects were at risk of 
      carrying mutations responsible for ALS, FTD, or both. Sixty-two percent of the 
      subjects came from families with a known hexanucleotide repeat expansion in 
      C9ORF72. During the same period, we counseled 840 subjects at risk of HD. 
      Subjects at risk of ALS/FTD had the presymptomatic test significantly sooner 
      after being aware of their risk, but were older than those at risk of HD. The 
      youngest subjects requesting the test had the highest disease load in the family 
      (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Demands for PT for ALS/FTD have been increasingly 
      growing, particularly since the discovery of the C9ORF72 gene. The major 
      specificity of the genetic counseling for these diseases is the unpredictability 
      of the clinical phenotype for most of the genes involved. Awareness of this added 
      uncertainty does not prevent individuals from taking the test, as the dropout 
      rate is not higher than that for HD.

TI  - Upper and Lower Limb Movement Kinematics in Aging FMR1 Gene Premutation Carriers.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci11010013 [doi]
LID - 13
AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative 
      disorder associated with a premutation cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion of the FMR1 gene. FXTAS is estimated to be the 
      most common single-gene form of ataxia in the aging population. Gait ataxia and 
      intention tremor are the primary behavioral symptoms of FXTAS, though clinical 
      evaluation of these symptoms often is subjective, contributing to difficulties in 
      reliably differentiating individuals with FXTAS and asymptomatic premutation 
      carriers. This study aimed to clarify the extent to which quantitative measures 
      of gait and upper limb kinematics may serve as biobehavioral markers of FXTAS 
      degeneration. Nineteen premutation carriers (aged 46-77 years), including 9 with 
      possible, probable, or definite FXTAS and 16 sex- and IQ-matched healthy 
      controls, completed tests of non-constrained walking and reaching while both 
      standing (static reaching) and walking (dynamic reaching) to quantify gait and 
      upper limb control, respectively. For the non-constrained walking task, 
      participants wore reflective markers and walked at their preferred speed on a 
      walkway. During the static reaching task, participants reached and lifted boxes 
      of different sizes while standing. During the dynamic reaching task, participants 
      walked to reach and lift the boxes. Movement kinematics were examined in relation 
      to clinical ratings of neuromotor impairments and CGG repeat length. During 
      non-constrained walking, individuals with FXTAS showed decreased stride lengths 
      and stride velocities, increased percentages of double support time, and 
      increased variabilities of cadence and center of mass relative to both 
      asymptomatic premutation carriers and controls. While individuals with FXTAS did 
      not show any static reaching differences relative to the other two groups, they 
      showed multiple differences during dynamic reaching trials, including reduced 
      maximum reaching velocity, prolonged acceleration time, and jerkier movement of 
      the shoulder, elbow, and hand. Gait differences during non-constrained walking 
      were associated with more severe clinically rated posture and gait symptoms. 
      Reduced maximum reaching velocity and increased jerkiness during dynamic reaching 
      were each related to more severe clinically rated kinetic dysfunction and overall 
      neuromotor symptoms in FMR1 premutation carriers. Our findings suggest kinematic 
      alterations consistent with gait ataxia and upper limb bradykinesia are each 
      selectively present in individuals with FXTAS, but not asymptomatic aging 
      premutation carriers. Consistent with neuropathological and magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) studies of FXTAS, these findings implicate cerebellar and basal 
      ganglia degeneration associated with neuromotor decline. Our results showing 
      associations between quantitative kinematic differences in FXTAS and clinical 
      ratings suggest that objective assessments of gait and reaching behaviors may 
      serve as critical and reliable targets for detecting FXTAS risk and monitoring 
      progression.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the Huntingtin gene. As 
      disease-modifying therapies for HD are being developed, peripheral blood cells 
      may be used to indicate disease progression and to monitor treatment response. In 
      order to investigate whether gene expression changes can be found in the blood of 
      individuals with HD that distinguish them from healthy controls, we performed 
      transcriptome analysis by next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq). We detected a 
      gene expression signature consistent with dysregulation of immune-related 
      functions and inflammatory response in peripheral blood from HD cases vs. 
      controls, including induction of the interferon response genes, IFITM3, IFI6 and 
      IRF7. Our results suggest that it is possible to detect gene expression changes 
      in blood samples from individuals with HD, which may reflect the immune pathology 
      associated with the disease.

      lower HTT have shown preclinical promise and are being evaluated in clinical 
      trials. However, clinical assessment of brain HTT lowering presents challenges. 
      We have reported that mutant HTT (mHTT) in the CSF of HD patients correlates with 
      clinical measures, including disease burden as well as motor and cognitive 
      performance. We have also shown that lowering HTT in the brains of HD mice 
      results in correlative reduction of mHTT in the CSF, prompting the use of this 
      measure as an exploratory marker of target engagement in clinical trials. In this 
      study, we investigate the mechanisms of mHTT clearance from the brain in adult 
      mice of both sexes to elucidate the significance of therapy-induced CSF mHTT 
      changes. We demonstrate that, although neurodegeneration increases CSF mHTT 
      concentrations, mHTT is also present in the CSF of mice in the absence of 
      neurodegeneration. Importantly, we show that secretion of mHTT from cells in the 
      CNS followed by glymphatic clearance from the extracellular space contributes to 
      mHTT in the CSF. Furthermore, we observe secretion of wild type HTT from healthy 
      control neurons, suggesting that HTT secretion is a normal process occurring in 
      the absence of pathogenesis. Overall, our data support both passive release and 
      active clearance of mHTT into CSF, suggesting that its treatment-induced changes 
      may represent a combination of target engagement and preservation of 
      neurons.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Changes in CSF mutant huntingtin (mHTT) are being 
      used as an exploratory endpoint in HTT lowering clinical trials for the treatment 
      of Huntington disease (HD). Recently, it was demonstrated that intrathecal 
      administration of a HTT lowering agent leads to dose-dependent reduction of CSF 
      mHTT in HD patients. However, little is known about how HTT, an intracellular 
      protein, reaches the extracellular space and ultimately the CSF. Our findings 
      that HTT enters CSF by both passive release and active secretion followed by 
      glymphatic clearance may have significant implications for interpretation of 
      treatment-induced changes of CSF mHTT in clinical trials for HD.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Disrupted cortico-striatal 
      transmission is an early event that contributes to neuronal spine and synapse 
      dysfunction primarily in striatal medium spiny neurons, the most vulnerable cell 
      type in the disease, but also in neurons of other brain regions including the 
      cortex. Although striatal and cortical neurons eventually degenerate, these 
      synaptic and circuit changes may underlie some of the earliest motor, cognitive, 
      and psychiatric symptoms. Moreover, synaptic dysfunction and spine loss are 
      hypothesized to be therapeutically reversible before neuronal death occurs, and 
      restoration of normal synaptic function may delay neurodegeneration. One of the 
      earliest synaptic alterations to occur in HD mouse models is enhanced striatal 
      extrasynaptic NMDA receptor expression and activity. This activity is mediated 
      primarily through GluN2B subunit-containing receptors and is associated with 
      increased activation of cell death pathways, inhibition of survival signaling, 
      and greater susceptibility to excitotoxicity. Death-associated protein kinase 1 
      (DAPK1) is a pro-apoptotic kinase highly expressed in neurons during development. 
      In the adult brain, DAPK1 becomes re-activated and recruited to extrasynaptic 
      NMDAR complexes during neuronal death, where it phosphorylates GluN2B at S1303, 
      amplifying toxic receptor function. Approaches to reduce DAPK1 activity have 
      demonstrated benefit in animal models of stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
      disease, and chronic stress, indicating that DAPK1 may be a novel target for 
      neuroprotection. Here, we demonstrate that dysregulation of DAPK1 occurs early in 
      the YAC128 HD mouse model, and contributes to elevated extrasynaptic GluN2B S1303 
      phosphorylation. Inhibition of DAPK1 normalizes extrasynaptic GluN2B 
      phosphorylation and surface expression, and completely prevents YAC128 striatal 
      spine loss in cortico-striatal co-culture, thus validating DAPK1 as a potential 
      target for synaptic protection in HD and warranting further development of 
      DAPK1-targeted therapies for neurodegeneration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder with onset and severity of symptoms influenced by various environmental 
      factors. Recent discoveries have highlighted the importance of the 
      gastrointestinal microbiome in mediating the gut-brain-axis bidirectional 
      communication via circulating factors. Using shotgun sequencing, we investigated 
      the gut microbiome composition in the R6/1 transgenic mouse model of HD from 4 to 
      12 weeks of age (early adolescent through to adult stages). Targeted metabolomics 
      was also performed on the blood plasma of these mice (n = 9 per group) at 
      12 weeks of age to investigate potential effects of gut dysbiosis on the plasma 
      metabolome profile. RESULTS: Modelled time profiles of each species, KEGG 
      Orthologs and bacterial genes, revealed heightened volatility in the R6/1 mice, 
      indicating potential early effects of the HD mutation in the gut. In addition to 
      gut dysbiosis in R6/1 mice at 12 weeks of age, gut microbiome function was 
      perturbed. In particular, the butanoate metabolism pathway was elevated, 
      suggesting increased production of the protective SCFA, butyrate, in the gut. No 
      significant alterations were found in the plasma butyrate and propionate levels 
      in the R6/1 mice at 12 weeks of age. The statistical integration of the 
      metagenomics and metabolomics unraveled several Bacteroides species that were 
      negatively correlated with ATP and pipecolic acid in the plasma. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      present study revealed the instability of the HD gut microbiome during the 
      pre-motor symptomatic stage of the disease which may have dire consequences on 
      the host's health. Perturbation of the HD gut microbiome function prior to 
      significant cognitive and motor dysfunction suggest the potential role of the gut 
      in modulating the pathogenesis of HD, potentially via specific altered plasma 
      metabolites which mediate gut-brain signaling.

AB  - We examined the role of repeat expansions in the pathogenesis of frontotemporal 
      dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by analyzing whole-genome 
      sequence data from 2,442 FTD/ALS patients, 2,599 Lewy body dementia (LBD) 
      patients, and 3,158 neurologically healthy subjects. Pathogenic expansions 
      (range, 40-64 CAG repeats) in the huntingtin (HTT) gene were found in three 
      (0.12%) patients diagnosed with pure FTD/ALS syndromes but were not present in 
      the LBD or healthy cohorts. We replicated our findings in an independent 
      collection of 3,674 FTD/ALS patients. Postmortem evaluations of two patients 
      revealed the classical TDP-43 pathology of FTD/ALS, as well as 
      huntingtin-positive, ubiquitin-positive aggregates in the frontal cortex. The 
      neostriatal atrophy that pathologically defines Huntington's disease was absent 
      in both cases. Our findings reveal an etiological relationship between HTT repeat 
      expansions and FTD/ALS syndromes and indicate that genetic screening of FTD/ALS 
      patients for HTT repeat expansions should be considered.

AB  - Novel treatments for Huntington's disease (HD), a progressive neurodegenerative 
      disorder, include selective targeting of the mutant allele of the huntingtin gene 
      (mHTT) carrying the abnormally expanded disease-causing cytosine-adenine-guanine 
      (CAG) repeat. WVE-120101 and WVE-120102 are investigational stereopure antisense 
      oligonucleotides that enable selective suppression of mHTT by targeting 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are in haplotype phase with the CAG 
      repeat expansion. Recently developed long-read sequencing technologies can 
      capture CAG expansions and distant SNPs of interest and potentially facilitate 
      haplotype-based identification of patients for clinical trials of oligonucleotide 
      therapies. However, improved methods are needed to phase SNPs with CAG repeat 
      expansions directly and reliably without need for familial genotype/haplotype 
      data. Our haplotype phasing method uses single-molecule real-time sequencing and 
      a custom algorithm to determine with confidence bases at SNPs on mutant alleles, 
      even without familial data. Herein, we summarize this methodology and validate 
      the approach using patient-derived samples with known phasing results. Comparison 
      of experimentally measured CAG repeat lengths, heterozygosity, and phasing with 
      previously determined results showed improved performance. Our methodology 
      enables the haplotype phasing of SNPs of interest and the disease-causing, 
      expanded CAG repeat of the huntingtin gene, enabling accurate identification of 
      patients with HD eligible for allele-selective clinical studies.

TI  - A Progressive Loss of phosphoSer138-Profilin Aligns with Symptomatic Course in 
      the R6/2 Mouse Model of Huntington's Disease: Possible Sex-Dependent Signaling.
PG  - 871-888
LID - 10.1007/s10571-020-00984-2 [doi]
AB  - The R6/2 transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease (HD) carries several 
      copies of exon1 of the huntingtin gene that contains a highly pathogenic 120 
      CAG-repeat expansion. We used kinome analysis to screen for kinase activity 
      patterns in neural tissues from wildtype (WT) and R6/2 mice at a pre-symptomatic 
      (e.g., embryonic) and symptomatic (e.g., between 3 and 10 weeks postnatal) time 
      points. We identified changes in several signaling cascades, for example, the 
      Akt/FoxO3/CDK2, mTOR/ULK1, and RAF/MEK/CREB pathways. We also identified the 
      Rho-Rac GTPase cascade that contributes to cytoskeleton organization through 
      modulation of the actin-binding proteins, cofilin and profilin. Immunoblotting 
      revealed higher levels of phosphoSer138-profilin in embryonic R6/2 mouse samples 
      (cf. WT mice) that diminish progressively and significantly over the postnatal, 
      symptomatic course of the disease. We detected sex- and genotype-dependent 
      patterns in the phosphorylation of actin-regulators such a ROCK2, PAK, LIMK1, 
      cofilin, and SSH1L, yet none of these aligned consistently with the changing 
      levels of phosphoSer138-profilin. This could be reflecting an imbalance in the 
      sequential influences these regulators are known to exert on actin signaling. The 
      translational potential of these observations was inferred from preliminary 
      observations of changes in LIMK-cofilin signaling and loss of neurite integrity 
      in neural stem cells derived from an HD patient (versus a healthy control). Our 
      observations suggest that a pre-symptomatic, neurodevelopmental onset of change 
      in the phosphorylation of Ser138-profilin, potentially downstream of distinct 
      signaling changes in male and female mice, could be contributing to cytoskeletal 
      phenotypes in the R6/2 mouse model of HD pathology.

TI  - DRPLA: understanding the natural history and developing biomarkers to accelerate 
      therapeutic trials in a globally rare repeat expansion disorder.
PG  - 3031-3041
LID - 10.1007/s00415-020-10218-6 [doi]
AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by CAG repeat expansions in the atrophin-1 gene and is inherited in an 
      autosomal dominant fashion. There are currently no disease-modifying treatments 
      available. The broad development of therapies for DRPLA, as well as other similar 
      rare diseases, has hit a roadblock due to the rarity of the condition and the 
      wide global distribution of patients and families, consequently inhibiting 
      biomarker development and therapeutic research. Considering the shifting focus 
      towards diverse populations, widespread genetic testing, rapid advancements in 
      the development of clinical and wet biomarkers for Huntington's disease (HD), and 
      the ongoing clinical trials for antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies, the 
      prospect of developing effective treatments in rare disorders has completely 
      changed. The awareness of the HD ASO program has prompted global collaboration 
      for rare disorders in natural history studies and the development of biomarkers, 
      with the eventual goal of undergoing treatment trials. Here, we discuss DRPLA, 
      which shares similarities with HD, and how in this and other repeat expansion 
      disorders, neurogenetics groups like ours at UCL are gearing up for forthcoming 
      natural history studies to accelerate future ASO treatment trials to hopefully 
      emulate the progress seen in HD.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder which is 
      characterised by a triad of highly debilitating motor, cognitive, and psychiatric 
      symptoms. While cell death occurs in many brain regions, GABAergic medium spiny 
      neurons (MSNs) in the striatum experience preferential and extensive 
      degeneration. Unlike most neurodegenerative disorders, HD is caused by a single 
      genetic mutation resulting in a CAG repeat expansion and the production of a 
      mutant Huntingtin protein (mHTT). Despite identifying the mutation causative of 
      HD in 1993, there are currently no disease-modifying treatments for HD. One 
      potential strategy for the treatment of HD is the development of cell-based 
      therapies. Cell-based therapies aim to restore neuronal circuitry and function by 
      replacing lost neurons, as well as providing neurotropic support to prevent 
      further degeneration. In order to successfully restore basal ganglia functioning 
      in HD, cell-based therapies would need to reconstitute the complex signalling 
      network disrupted by extensive MSN degeneration. This chapter will discuss the 
      potential use of foetal tissue grafts, pluripotent stem cells, neural stem cells, 
      and somatic cell reprogramming to develop cell-based therapies for treating HD.

      Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington Disease-Like 2 (HDL2) is a rare autosomal dominant 
      disorder caused by an abnormal CAG/CTG triplet repeat expansion on chromosome 
      16q24. The symptoms of progressive decline in motor, cognitive and psychiatric 
      functioning are similar to those of Huntington's disease (HD). The psychiatric 
      features of the HDL2 have been poorly characterized. OBJECTIVE: To describe the 
      neuropsychiatric features of HDL2 and compare them with those of HD. METHODS: A 
      blinded cross-sectional design was used to compare the behavioural component of 
      the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) in participants with HDL2 
      (n = 15) and HD (n = 13) with African ancestry. RESULTS: HDL2 patients presented 
      with psychiatric symptoms involving mood disturbances and behavioural changes 
      that were not significantly different from those in the HD group. Duration of 
      disease and motor performance correlated (p < 0.001) with the Functional Capacity 
      score and the Independence score of the UHDRS. HD patients reported movement 
      dysfunction as the first symptom more frequently than HDL2 Patients (p < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: The psychiatric phenotype of HDL2 is similar to that of HD and linked 
      to motor decline and disease duration. Psychiatric symptoms seem more severe for 
      HDL2 patients in the early stages of the disease.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene. Emerging 
      evidence shows that additional epigenetic factors can modify disease phenotypes. 
      Harnessing the ability of the epigenome to modify the disease for therapeutic 
      purposes is therefore of interest. Epigenome modifiers, such as histone 
      deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), have improved pathology in a range of HD models. 
      Yet in clinical trials, HDACi have failed to alleviate HD symptoms in patients. 
      This study investigated potential reasons for the lack of translation of the 
      therapeutic benefits of HDACi from lab to clinic. We analysed histone acetylation 
      patterns of immuno-positive nuclei from brain sections and tissue microarrays 
      from post-mortem human control and HD cases alongside several well-established HD 
      models (OVT73 transgenic HD sheep, YAC128 mice, and an in vitro cell model 
      expressing 97Q mutant huntingtin). Significant increases in histone H4 
      acetylation were observed in post-mortem HD cases, OVT73 transgenic HD sheep and 
      in vitro models; these changes were absent in YAC128 mice. In addition, nuclear 
      labelling for acetyl-histone H4 levels were inversely proportional to mutant 
      huntingtin aggregate load in HD human cortex. Our data raise concerns regarding 
      the utility of HDACi for the treatment of HD when regions of pathology exhibit 
      already elevated histone acetylation patterns and emphasize the importance of 
      searching for alternative epigenetic targets in future therapeutic strategies 
      aiming to rescue HD phenotypes.

AB  - Huntington's disease is caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat within exon 1 of 
      the HTT gene, which is unstable, leading to further expansion, the extent of 
      which is brain region and peripheral tissue specific. The identification of DNA 
      repair genes as genetic modifiers of Huntington's disease, that were known to 
      abrogate somatic instability in Huntington's disease mouse models, demonstrated 
      that somatic CAG expansion is central to disease pathogenesis, and that the CAG 
      repeat threshold for pathogenesis in specific brain cells might not be known. We 
      have previously shown that the HTT gene is incompletely spliced generating a 
      small transcript that encodes the highly pathogenic exon 1 HTT protein. The 
      longer the CAG repeat, the more of this toxic fragment is generated, providing a 
      pathogenic consequence for somatic expansion. Here, we have used the R6/2 mouse 
      model to investigate the molecular and behavioural consequences of expressing 
      exon 1 HTT with 90 CAGs, a mutation that causes juvenile Huntington's disease, 
      compared to R6/2 mice carrying  approximately 200 CAGs, a repeat expansion of a size rarely 
      found in Huntington's disease patient's blood, but which has been detected in 
      post-mortem brains as a consequence of somatic CAG repeat expansion. We show that 
      nuclear aggregation occurred earlier in R6/2(CAG)(90) mice and that this 
      correlated with the onset of transcriptional dysregulation. Whereas in 
      R6/2(CAG)(200) mice, cytoplasmic aggregates accumulated rapidly and closely 
      tracked with the progression of behavioural phenotypes and with end-stage 
      disease. We find that aggregate species formed in the R6/2(CAG)(90) brains have 
      different properties to those in the R6/2(CAG)(200) mice. Within the nucleus, 
      they retain a diffuse punctate appearance throughout the course of the disease, 
      can be partially solubilized by detergents and have a greater seeding potential 
      in young mice. In contrast, aggregates from R6/2(CAG)(200) brains polymerize into 
      larger structures that appear as inclusion bodies. These data emphasize that a 
      subcellular analysis, using multiple complementary approaches, must be undertaken 
      in order to draw any conclusions about the relationship between HTT aggregation 
      and the onset and progression of disease phenotypes.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in HTT. The length of this repeat, however, only explains a 
      proportion of the variability in age of onset in patients. Genome-wide 
      association studies have identified modifiers that contribute toward a proportion 
      of the observed variance. By incorporating tissue-specific transcriptomic 
      information with these results, additional modifiers can be identified. We 
      performed a transcriptome-wide association study assessing heritable differences 
      in genetically determined expression in diverse tissues, with genome-wide data 
      from over 4000 patients. Functional validation of prioritized genes was 
      undertaken in isogenic HD stem cells and patient brains. Enrichment analyses were 
      performed with biologically relevant gene sets to identify the core pathways. 
      HD-associated gene coexpression modules were assessed for associations with 
      neurological phenotypes in an independent cohort and to guide drug repurposing 
      analyses. Transcriptomic analyses identified genes that were associated with age 
      of HD onset and displayed colocalization with gene expression signals in brain 
      tissue (FAN1, GPR161, PMS2, SUMF2), with supporting evidence from functional 
      experiments. This included genes involved in DNA repair, as well as 
      novel-candidate modifier genes that have been associated with other neurological 
      conditions. Further, cortical coexpression modules were also associated with 
      cognitive decline and HD-related traits in a longitudinal cohort. In summary, the 
      combination of population-scale gene expression information with HD patient 
      genomic data identified novel modifier genes for the disorder. Further, these 
      analyses expanded the pathways potentially involved in modifying HD onset and 
      prioritized candidate therapeutics for future study.

TI  - Promotion of somatic CAG repeat expansion by Fan1 knock-out in Huntington's 
      disease knock-in mice is blocked by Mlh1 knock-out.
PG  - 3044-3053
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddaa196 [doi]
AB  - Recent genome-wide association studies of age-at-onset in Huntington's disease 
      (HD) point to distinct modes of potential disease modification: altering the rate 
      of somatic expansion of the HTT CAG repeat or altering the resulting CAG 
      threshold length-triggered toxicity process. Here, we evaluated the mouse 
      orthologs of two HD age-at-onset modifier genes, FAN1 and RRM2B, for an influence 
      on somatic instability of the expanded CAG repeat in Htt CAG knock-in mice. Fan1 
      knock-out increased somatic expansion of Htt CAG repeats, in the juvenile- and 
      the adult-onset HD ranges, whereas knock-out of Rrm2b did not greatly alter 
      somatic Htt CAG repeat instability. Simultaneous knock-out of Mlh1, the ortholog 
      of a third HD age-at-onset modifier gene (MLH1), which suppresses somatic 
      expansion of the Htt knock-in CAG repeat, blocked the Fan1 knock-out-induced 
      acceleration of somatic CAG expansion. This genetic interaction indicates that 
      functional MLH1 is required for the CAG repeat destabilizing effect of FAN1 loss. 
      Thus, in HD, it is uncertain whether the RRM2B modifier effect on timing of onset 
      may be due to a DNA instability mechanism. In contrast, the FAN1 modifier effects 
      reveal that functional FAN1 acts to suppress somatic CAG repeat expansion, likely 
      in genetic interaction with other DNA instability modifiers whose combined 
      effects can hasten or delay onset and other CAG repeat length-driven phenotypes.

      Huntington's disease.
PG  - 1119-1130
LID - 10.1177/0271678X20949286 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG triplet 
      repeat expansion in the Huntingtin gene. Metabolic and microvascular 
      abnormalities in the brain may contribute to early physiological changes that 
      subserve the functional impairments in HD. This study is intended to investigate 
      potential abnormality in dynamic changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) and 
      cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) in the 
      brain in response to functional stimulation in premanifest and early manifest HD 
      patients. A recently developed 3-D-TRiple-acquisition-after-Inversion-Preparation 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach was used to measure dynamic responses 
      in CBV, CBF, and CMRO(2) during visual stimulation in one single MRI scan. 
      Experiments were conducted in 23 HD patients and 16 healthy controls. Decreased 
      occipital cortex CMRO(2) responses were observed in premanifest and early 
      manifest HD patients compared to controls (P < 0.001), correlating with the 
      CAG-Age Product scores in these patients (R(2) = 0.4, P = 0.001). The results 
      suggest the potential value of this reduced CMRO(2) response during visual 
      stimulation as a biomarker for HD and may illuminate the role of metabolic 
      alterations in the pathophysiology of HD.

TI  - Screening for the C9ORF72 expansion in Greek Huntington Disease phenocopies and 
      controls and meta-analysis of current data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several European studies examined the role of C9orf72 repeat 
      expansion in patients with Huntington-disease like phenotypes (HD-L). The scope 
      of our study is to investigate the expansion frequency in a Greek HD-L cohort and 
      the meta-analysis of all published cases. This will be of use in genetic 
      counseling of these cases. METHODS: A cohort of 74 patients with HD-L and 67 
      healthy controls were screened for the C9orf72 expansion status. Case-controls 
      comparison was assessed with the Pearson's chi-square statistic for a 2 x 2 
      table.A systematic database search was conducted and seven studies, including the 
      current study, were considered eligible for inclusion in a meta-analysis 
      considering a total of 812 patients with HD phenocopies. Pooled mutation 
      frequency was calculated using a Random Effects model or the Mantel-Haezsel fixed 
      effects model, depending on the observed heterogeneity. RESULTS: In our cohort, 
      one patient was found to have a pathologic expansion of C9orf72, and none from 
      the control group (chi-square: 0.91, p-value: 0.34). Pooled mutation frequency 
      was found at 2% (CI: 1-3%) with low heterogeneity (I(2):15%). DISCUSSION: Based 
      on this meta-analysis the recommendation for genetic testing for C9orf72 
      expansions is further solidified.

TI  - Patterns of CAG repeat instability in the central nervous system and periphery in 
      Huntington's disease and in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.
PG  - 2551-2567
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddaa139 [doi]
AB  - The expanded HTT CAG repeat causing Huntington's disease (HD) exhibits somatic 
      expansion proposed to drive the rate of disease onset by eliciting a pathological 
      process that ultimately claims vulnerable cells. To gain insight into somatic 
      expansion in humans, we performed comprehensive quantitative analyses of CAG 
      expansion in ~50 central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral postmortem tissues 
      from seven adult-onset and one juvenile-onset HD individual. We also assessed 
      ATXN1 CAG repeat expansion in brain regions of an individual with a 
      neurologically and pathologically distinct repeat expansion disorder, 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). Our findings reveal similar profiles of 
      tissue instability in all HD individuals, which, notably, were also apparent in 
      the SCA1 individual. CAG expansion was observed in all tissues, but to different 
      degrees, with multiple cortical regions and neostriatum tending to have the 
      greatest instability in the CNS, and liver in the periphery. These patterns 
      indicate different propensities for CAG expansion contributed by disease 
      locus-independent trans-factors and demonstrate that expansion per se is not 
      sufficient to cause cell type or disease-specific pathology. Rather, pathology 
      may reflect distinct toxic processes triggered by different repeat lengths across 
      cell types and diseases. We also find that the HTT CAG length-dependent expansion 
      propensity of an individual is reflected in all tissues and in cerebrospinal 
      fluid. Our data indicate that peripheral cells may be a useful source to measure 
      CAG expansion in biomarker assays for therapeutic efforts, prompting efforts to 
      dissect underlying mechanisms of expansion that may differ between the brain and 
      periphery.

TI  - Frequency of the loss of CAA interruption in the HTT CAG tract and implications 
      for Huntington disease in the reduced penetrance range.
PG  - 2108-2113
LID - 10.1038/s41436-020-0917-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In some Huntington disease (HD) patients, the "loss of interruption" 
      (LOI) variant eliminates an interrupting codon in the HTT CAG-repeat tract, which 
      causes earlier age of onset (AOO). The magnitude of this effect is uncertain, 
      since previous studies included few LOI carriers, and the variant also causes CAG 
      size misestimation. We developed a rapid LOI detection screen, enabling unbiased 
      frequency estimation among manifest HD patients. Additionally, we combined 
      published data with clinical data from newly identified patients to accurately 
      characterize the LOI's effect on AOO. METHODS: We developed a LOI detection 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, and screened patients to estimate the 
      frequency of the LOI variant and its effect on AOO. RESULTS: Mean onset for LOI 
      carriers (n = 49) is 20.4 years earlier than expected based on diagnosed CAG 
      size. After correcting for CAG size underestimation, the variant is still 
      associated with onset 9.5 years earlier. The LOI is present in 1.02% of 
      symptomatic HD patients, and in 32.2% of symptomatic reduced penetrance (RP) 
      range patients (36-39 CAGs). CONCLUSION: The LOI causes significantly earlier 
      onset, greater than expected by CAG length, particularly in persons with 36-39 
      CAG repeats. Detection of this variant has implications for HD families, 
      especially for those in the RP range.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      trinucleotide (CAG) repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT). The R6/2 
      transgenic mouse model of HD expresses exon 1 of the human HTT gene with 
      approximately 150 CAG repeats. R6/2 mice develop progressive behavioural 
      abnormalities, impaired neurogenesis, and atrophy of several brain regions. In 
      recent years, erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to confer neuroprotection and 
      enhance neurogenesis, rendering it a promising molecule to attenuate HD symptoms. 
      In this study, the therapeutic potential of EPO was evaluated in female R6/2 
      transgenic mice. A single bilateral injection of a lentivirus encoding human EPO 
      (LV-hEPO) was performed into the lateral ventricles of R6/2 mice at disease onset 
      (8 weeks of age). Control groups were either untreated or injected with a 
      lentivirus encoding green fluorescent protein (LV-GFP). Thirty days after virus 
      administration, hEPO mRNA and protein were present in injected R6/2 brains. 
      Compared to control R6/2 mice, LV-hEPO-treated R6/2 mice exhibited reduced 
      hippocampal atrophy, increased neuroblast branching towards the dentate granular 
      cell layer, and improved spatial cognition. Our results suggest that LV-hEPO 
      administration may be a promising strategy to reduce cognitive impairment in HD.

AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are incurable neurological disorders caused by CAG 
      repeat expansion in the open reading frames (ORFs) of specific genes. This type 
      of mutation in the HTT gene is responsible for Huntington's disease (HD). CAG 
      repeat-targeting artificial miRNAs (art-miRNAs) were shown as attractive 
      therapeutic approach for polyQ disorders as they caused allele-selective decrease 
      in the level of mutant proteins. Here, using polyQ disease models, we aimed to 
      demonstrate how miRNA-based gene expression regulation is dependent on target 
      sequence features. We show that the silencing efficiency and selectivity of 
      art-miRNAs is influenced by the localization of the CAG repeat tract within 
      transcript and the specific sequence context. Furthermore, we aimed to reveal the 
      events leading to downregulation of mutant polyQ proteins and found very rapid 
      activation of translational repression and HTT transcript deadenylation. 
      Slicer-activity of AGO2 was dispensable in this process, as determined in AGO2 
      knockout cells generated with CRISPR-Cas9 technology. We also showed highly 
      allele-selective downregulation of huntingtin in human HD neural progenitors 
      (NPs). Taken together, art-miRNA activity may serve as a model of the cooperative 
      activity and targeting of ORF regions by endogenous miRNAs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnostic workup for choreiform movement disorders including 
      Huntington's disease (HD) and those mimicking HD like phenotype is complex. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to genetically define HD and HD-like 
      presentations in an Indian cohort. We also describe HTT-CAG expansion manifesting 
      as neuroferritinopathy-like disorder in four families from Punjab in India. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: 159 patients clinically diagnosed as HD and HD-like 
      presentations from various tertiary neurology clinics were referred to our centre 
      (CSIR-IGIB) for genetic investigations. As a first tier test, CAG-TNR for HTT was 
      performed and subsequently HD-negative samples were screened for JPH3 (HDL2), TBP 
      (SCA17), ATN1 (DRPLA), PPP2R2B (SCA12) and GGGGCC expansion in C9orf72 gene. Four 
      families presenting as neuroferritinopathy-like disorder were also investigated 
      for HTT-CAG expansion. RESULTS: 94 of 159 (59%) patients were found to have 
      expanded HTT-CAG repeats. Pathogenic repeat expansion in JPH3, TBP, ATN1 and 
      C9orf72 were not found in HD negative cases. Two patients were positive for 
      SCA12-CAG expansion in pathogenic length, whereas 5 cases harboured TBP-CAG 
      repeats falling in reduced penetrance range of 41- 48 repeats for SCA17. Four 
      unrelated families, presented with atypical chorea and brain MRI findings 
      suggestive of basal ganglia abnormalities mimicking neuroferritinopathy were 
      found to harbour HTT-CAG expansion. CONCLUSION: We present SCA12 as a new 
      reported phenocopy of HD which should be considered for diagnostic workout along 
      with SCA17 for HD-like syndromes. This study also illustrates the necessity, to 
      consider evolving HD like phenotype, as a clinical diagnosis for cases with 
      initial manifestations depicting neuroferritinopathy.

AB  - PURPOSE: We aimed to determine the origin and genetic characteristics of 
      Huntington disease (HD) in the Middle East. METHODS: We performed genetic and 
      genealogical analyses to establish the ancestral origin of the HTT pathgenic 
      variant from a large kindred from Oman (hereafter called the OM-HD-01 pedigree) 
      by single-nucleotide polymorphism and dense haplotype analysis genotyping. 
      RESULTS: We traced the oldest ancestry of the largest, eight-generation, OM-HD-01 
      pedigree (n = 302 subjects, with 54 showing manifest HD) back to sub-Saharan 
      Africa and identified a unique HD haplotype carried by all pedigree members, 
      which consisted of portions of the C6 and C9 haplotypes and was carried by all 
      affected members. Such a unique HD haplotype was of African origin and appeared 
      to be associated with large CAG repeat expansions on average and high frequency 
      of juvenile-onset HD. Three other families from the same area were also 
      identified and found carrying a Caucasian HD haplotype A, also shared by most 
      families of Arab ancestry. CONCLUSION: Mutated HTT spread into Middle East with a 
      unique haplotype of African origin, appeared to be associated with 
      juvenile-onset, a HD condition frequently occurring in Black Africans, and may 
      have a significant impact on further development of novel targeted genetic 
      therapies.

      expansion.

LID - eaaz4012
AB  - Expanded CAG/CTG repeats underlie 13 neurological disorders, including myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and Huntington's disease (HD). Upon expansion, disease 
      loci acquire heterochromatic characteristics, which may provoke changes to 
      chromatin conformation and thereby affect both gene expression and repeat 
      instability. Here, we tested this hypothesis by performing 4C sequencing at the 
      DMPK and HTT loci from DM1 and HD-derived cells. We find that allele sizes 
      ranging from 15 to 1700 repeats displayed similar chromatin interaction profiles. 
      This was true for both loci and for alleles with different DNA methylation levels 
      and CTCF binding. Moreover, the ectopic insertion of an expanded CAG repeat tract 
      did not change the conformation of the surrounding chromatin. We conclude that 
      CAG/CTG repeat expansions are not enough to alter chromatin conformation in cis. 
      Therefore, it is unlikely that changes in chromatin interactions drive repeat 
      instability or changes in gene expression in these disorders.

      Pharmacokinetics, Acute Liver Toxicity, and Vomiting in Children With Acute 
      Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treated With High Doses of Methotrexate.

AB  - Introduction: High dose methotrexate (HD-Mtx) is highly effective and 
      significantly improves overall acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients 
      survival. The pharmacodynamics of Mtx depends on the polymorphism of genes 
      encoding proteins engaged in the folate metabolism pathway. The aim of the 
      current study is to determine the relationship between variants of folate 
      metabolism-related genes and the frequency of acute toxicities of HD-Mtx. 
      Material and Methods: A group of 133 patients aged 1.5-18.1 years (median: 6.3) 
      was treated in accordance with the ALL-IC-2002 and ALL-IC-2009 protocols. The 
      following polymorphisms were determined: 80 G>A SLC19A1 (solute carrier family 19 
      member 1; rs1051266) with direct DNA sequencing, as well as 677 C>T MTHFR 
      (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; rs1801133) and the tandem repeats of the TS 
      (thymidylate synthase) with PCR technique. HD-Mtx organ toxicities were evaluated 
      based on the laboratory tests results and the National Cancer Institute criteria. 
      Results: In patients with genotypes AA for SLC19A1 and CC or CT for MTHFR Mtx 
      steady state concentrations (C(ss)) and AUC(inf) were distinctly higher. In 
      patients with genotype 3R/3R for TS initial elimination rate constant was 
      significantly higher (P = 0.003). Patients receiving Mtx at the dose of 5 g/m(2) 
      had lower clearance (4.35 vs. 8.92 L/h/m(2)) as compared to the ones receiving 2 
      g/m(2) that indicates non-linear Mtx elimination at the higher dose. Liver 
      impairment was the most frequently observed toxicity. The homozygous genotype was 
      associated with a significantly higher incidence of hepatic toxicity for both the 
      SLC19A1 (P = 0.037) and TS (P = 0.002). Logistic regression analysis indicated an 
      increased risk of vomiting for the 2R/3R genotype of the TS gene (OR 3.20, 95% CI 
      1.33-7.68, P = 0.009) and for vomiting and hepatic toxicity for the 3R/3R 
      genotype (vomiting: OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.12-10.23, P = 0.031; liver toxicity: OR 
      2.28, 95% CI 1.05-4.95, P = 0.038). None of the acute toxicities differed between 
      the analyzed dosing groups. Conclusions: Determination of polymorphisms of 
      SLC19A1, MTHFR, and TS genes might allow for a better prior selection of patients 
      with higher risk of elevated Mtx levels. Our study is the first one to report the 
      increased risk of hepatotoxicity and vomiting in patients with TS polymorphisms.

AB  - A recent genome-wide association study of Huntington disease (HD) implicated 
      genes involved in DNA maintenance processes as modifiers of onset, including 
      multiple genome-wide significant signals in a chr15 region containing the DNA 
      repair gene Fanconi-Associated Nuclease 1 (FAN1). Here, we have carried out 
      detailed genetic, molecular, and cellular investigation of the modifiers at this 
      locus. We find that missense changes within or near the DNA-binding domain 
      (p.Arg507His and p.Arg377Trp) reduce FAN1's DNA-binding activity and its capacity 
      to rescue mitomycin C-induced cytotoxicity, accounting for two infrequent 
      onset-hastening modifier signals. We also idenified a third onset-hastening 
      modifier signal whose mechanism of action remains uncertain but does not involve 
      an amino acid change in FAN1. We present additional evidence that a frequent 
      onset-delaying modifier signal does not alter FAN1 coding sequence but is 
      associated with increased FAN1 mRNA expression in the cerebral cortex. Consistent 
      with these findings and other cellular overexpression and/or suppression studies, 
      knockout of FAN1 increased CAG repeat expansion in HD-induced pluripotent stem 
      cells. Together, these studies support the process of somatic CAG repeat 
      expansion as a therapeutic target in HD, and they clearly indicate that multiple 
      genetic variations act by different means through FAN1 to influence HD onset in a 
      manner that is largely additive, except in the rare circumstance that two 
      onset-hastening alleles are present. Thus, an individual's particular combination 
      of FAN1 haplotypes may influence their suitability for HD clinical trials, 
      particularly if the therapeutic agent aims to reduce CAG repeat instability.

AB  - SAFB1 is a DNA and RNA binding protein that is highly expressed in the cerebellum 
      and hippocampus and is involved in the processing of coding and non-coding RNAs, 
      splicing and dendritic function. We analyzed SAFB1 expression in the post-mortem 
      brain tissue of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), Huntington's disease (HD), Multiple 
      sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease patients and controls. In SCA cases, the 
      expression of SAFB1 in the nucleus was increased and there was abnormal and 
      extensive expression in the cytoplasm where it co-localized with the markers of 
      Purkinje cell injury. Significantly, no SAFB1 expression was found in the 
      cerebellar neurons of the dentate nucleus in control or MS patients; however, in 
      SCA patients, SAFB1 expression was increased significantly in both the nucleus 
      and cytoplasm of dentate neurons. In HD, we found that SAFB1 expression was 
      increased in the nucleus and cytoplasm of striatal neurons; however, there was no 
      SAFB1 staining in the striatal neurons of controls. In PD substantia nigra, we 
      did not see any changes in neuronal SAFB1 expression. iCLIP analysis found that 
      SAFB1 crosslink sites within ATXN1 RNA were adjacent to the start and within the 
      glutamine repeat sequence. Further investigation found increased binding of SAFB1 
      to pathogenic ATXN1-85Q mRNA. These novel data strongly suggest SAFB1 contributes 
      to the etiology of SCA and Huntington's chorea and that it may be a pathological 
      marker of polyglutamine repeat expansion diseases.

AB  - Trinucleotide (CAG) repeat expansions longer than 39 in the huntingtin (HTT) gene 
      cause Huntington's disease (HD). The frequency of intermediate alleles (IA) with 
      a length of 27-35 in the general population is not fully known, but studied in 
      specific materials connected to the incidence of HD. The Swedish Huntingtin 
      Alleles and Phenotype (SHAPE) study aims to assess the frequency of trinucleotide 
      repeat expansions in the HTT gene in north Sweden. 8260 individuals unselected 
      for HD from the counties of Norr- and Vasterbotten in the north of Sweden were 
      included. DNA samples were obtained and analysis of the HTT gene was performed, 
      yielding data on HTT gene expansion length in 7379 individuals. A high frequency 
      of intermediate alleles, 6.8%, was seen. Also, individuals with repeat numbers 
      lower than ever previously reported (<5) were found. These results suggest a high 
      frequency of HD in the norther parts of Sweden. Subsequent analyses may elucidate 
      the influence of IA:s on traits other than HD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The huntingtin gene (HTT) pathogenic cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) 
      repeat expansion responsible for Huntington disease (HD) is phased with single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), providing targets for allele-selective 
      treatments. OBJECTIVE: This prospective observational study defined the frequency 
      at which rs362307 (SNP1) or rs362331 (SNP2) was found on the same allele with 
      pathogenic CAG expansions. METHODS: Across 7 US sites, 202 individuals with HD 
      provided blood samples that were processed centrally to determine the number and 
      size of CAG repeats, presence and heterozygosity of SNPs, and whether SNPs were 
      present on the mutant HTT allele using long-read sequencing and phasing. RESULTS: 
      Heterozygosity of SNP1 and/or SNP2 was identified in 146 (72%) individuals. The 2 
      polymorphisms were associated only with the mHTT allele in 61% (95% high density 
      interval: 55%, 67%) of individuals. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent 
      with previous reports and demonstrate the feasibility of genotyping, phasing, and 
      targeting of HTT SNPs for personalized treatment of HD.

TI  - Pathogenic SREK1 decrease in Huntington's disease lowers TAF1 mimicking X-linked 
      dystonia parkinsonism.
PG  - 2207-2219
LID - 10.1093/brain/awaa150 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease and X-linked dystonia parkinsonism are two monogenic basal 
      ganglia model diseases. Huntington's disease is caused by a 
      polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene leading 
      to several toxic interactions of both the expanded CAG-containing mRNA and the 
      polyglutamine-containing protein, while X-linked dystonia parkinsonism is caused 
      by a retrotransposon insertion in the TAF1 gene, which decreases expression of 
      this core scaffold of the basal transcription factor complex TFIID. SRSF6 is an 
      RNA-binding protein of the serine and arginine-rich (SR) protein family that 
      interacts with expanded CAG mRNA and is sequestered into the characteristic 
      polyglutamine-containing inclusion bodies of Huntington's disease brains. Here we 
      report decreased levels of the SRSF6 interactor and regulator SREK1-another SR 
      protein involved in RNA processing-which includes TAF1 as one of its targets. 
      This led us to hypothesize that Huntington's disease and X-linked dystonia 
      parkinsonism pathogeneses converge in TAF1 alteration. We show that diminishing 
      SRSF6 through RNA interference in human neuroblastoma cells leads to a decrease 
      in SREK1 levels, which, in turn, suffices to cause diminished TAF1 levels. We 
      also observed decreased SREK1 and TAF1 levels in striatum of Huntington's disease 
      patients and transgenic model mice. We then generated mice with neuronal 
      transgenic expression of SREK1 (TgSREK1 mice) that, interestingly, showed 
      transcriptomic alterations complementary to those in Huntington's disease mice. 
      Most importantly, by combining Huntington's disease and TgSREK1 mice we verify 
      that SREK1 overexpression corrects TAF1 deficiency and attenuates striatal 
      atrophy and motor phenotype of Huntington's disease mice. Our results therefore 
      demonstrate that altered RNA processing upon SREK1 dysregulation plays a key role 
      in Huntington's disease pathogenesis and pinpoint TAF1 as a likely general 
      determinant of selective vulnerability of the striatum in multiple neurological 
      disorders.

TI  - Tau Accumulation via Reduced Autophagy Mediates GGGGCC Repeat Expansion-Induced 
      Neurodegeneration in Drosophila Model of ALS.
PG  - 1414-1428
LID - 10.1007/s12264-020-00518-2 [doi]
AB  - Expansions of trinucleotide or hexanucleotide repeats lead to several 
      neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington disease [caused by expanded CAG 
      repeats (CAGr) in the HTT gene], and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS, possibly 
      caused by expanded GGGGCC repeats (G4C2r) in the C9ORF72 gene], of which the 
      molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that lowering the 
      Drosophila homologue of tau protein (dtau) significantly rescued in vivo 
      neurodegeneration, motor performance impairments, and the shortened life-span in 
      Drosophila expressing expanded CAGr or expanded G4C2r. Expression of human tau 
      (htau4R) restored the disease-related phenotypes that had been mitigated by the 
      loss of dtau, suggesting an evolutionarily-conserved role of tau in 
      neurodegeneration. We further revealed that G4C2r expression increased tau 
      accumulation by inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion, possibly due to 
      lowering the level of BAG3, a regulator of autophagy and tau. Taken together, our 
      results reveal a novel mechanism by which expanded G4C2r causes neurodegeneration 
      via an evolutionarily-conserved mechanism. Our findings provide novel 
      autophagy-related mechanistic insights into C9ORF72-ALS and possible entry points 
      to disease treatment.

AB  - In neurodegeneration studies, researchers are faced with problems such as limited 
      material availability and late disease manifestation. Cell models provide the 
      opportunity to investigate molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis. Moreover, genome 
      editing technologies enable generation of isogenic cell models of hereditary 
      diseases. Our protocol outlines an approach for introducing an expanded CAG 
      repeat tract into the first exon of the HTT gene, the Huntington's disease 
      causing mutation. The protocol allows modeling the disease at various severity 
      levels by introducing different numbers of CAG repeats. Furthermore, the protocol 
      can be applicable for modeling other diseases caused by trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion. It is important to note there are many difficulties with cloning 
      repeated sequences and amplification of GC-rich regions. Here, we also propose 
      troubleshooting options, which overcome these problems. The protocol is based on 
      CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination with a uniquely designed donor 
      plasmid harboring an expanded CAG tract flanked with long homology arms. (c) 2020

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin 
      gene. The expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat of the encoded protein leads to 
      protein misfolding and aggregation, resulting in increased neuronal cell death. 
      DNAJ co-chaperones play a crucial role in transferring misfolded/unfolded 
      proteins to HSP70 chaperones, which play an essential role for protein folding. 
      Here, we investigated the effect of knock out (KO) of three individual DNAJ genes 
      in HEK293 cells expressing polyglutamine74exon1 huntingtin (polyQ74htt). 
      Flourescence microscopy analysis revealed that KO of DNAJB6 resulted in a 5-fold 
      increase in polyQ74htt aggregation and that DNAJA1 KO resulted in a 4-fold 
      decrease of polyQ74htt aggregation. KO of DNAJB1 did not change the propensity of 
      polyQ74htt to aggregate in cells. These findings where confirmed both by 
      fluorescence microscopy analysis and filter trap assay (FTA). DNAJB6 KO cells 
      displayed an increased rate of cell death as assessed by trypan blue exclusion 
      and propidium iodide (PI) uptake assays. These results demonstrate that the DNAJ 
      proteins DNAJA1 and DNAJB6 can modulate polyQ aggregation in opposite manners, 
      and thus that fine-tuning the cellular levels of DNAJ proteins is critical for 
      suppression of polyQ aggregation and cell survival.

AB  - Expanded CAG nucleotide repeats are the underlying genetic cause of at least 14 
      incurable diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD). The toxicity associated 
      with many CAG repeat expansions is thought to be due to the translation of the 
      CAG repeat to create a polyQ protein, which forms toxic oligomers and aggregates. 
      However, recent studies show that HD CAG repeats undergo a non-canonical form of 
      translation called Repeat-associated non-AUG dependent (RAN) translation. RAN 
      translation of the CAG sense and CUG anti-sense RNAs produces six distinct repeat 
      peptides: polyalanine (polyAla, from both CAG and CUG repeats), polyserine 
      (polySer), polyleucine (polyLeu), polycysteine (polyCys), and polyglutamine 
      (polyGln). The toxic potential of individual CAG-derived RAN polypeptides is not 
      well understood. We developed pure C. elegans protein models for each CAG RAN 
      polypeptide using codon-varied expression constructs that preserve RAN protein 
      sequence but eliminate repetitive CAG/CUG RNA. While all RAN polypeptides formed 
      aggregates, only polyLeu was consistently toxic across multiple cell types. In 
      GABAergic neurons, which exhibit significant neurodegeneration in HD patients, 
      codon-varied (Leu)38, but not (Gln)38, caused substantial neurodegeneration and 
      motility defects. Our studies provide the first in vivo evaluation of CAG-derived 
      RAN polypeptides in a multicellular model organism and suggest that 
      polyQ-independent mechanisms, such as RAN-translated polyLeu peptides, may have a 
      significant pathological role in CAG repeat expansion disorders.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene. HD patient-specific induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) represent an excellent model for the disease 
      study. We generated iPSC line from blood mononuclear cells of HD patient with 38 
      CAG repeats in the HTT exon 1 using integration free episomal plasmids expressing 
      Yamanaka factors. The iPSC line retained the disease causing mutation and 
      expressed pluripotency markers. It also displayed a normal karyotype and the 
      ability to differentiate into derivatives of three germ layers.

TI  - Live births following preimplantation genetic testing for dynamic mutation 
      diseases by karyomapping: a report of three cases.
PG  - 539-548
LID - 10.1007/s10815-020-01718-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic defects (PGT-M) is a 
      beneficial strategy for the patients suffering from a Mendelian disease, which 
      could protect their offspring from inheriting the disease. The purpose of this 
      study is to report the effectiveness of PGT-M based on karyomapping for three 
      cases of dynamic mutation diseases with trinucleotide repeat expansion. METHODS: 
      PGT-M was carried out on three couples, whose family members were diagnosed with 
      Huntington's disease or spinocerebellar ataxias 2 or 12. The whole genome 
      amplification was obtained using the multiple displacement amplification (MDA) 
      method. Then, karyomapping was performed to detect the allele that is carrying 
      the trinucleotide repeat expansion using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
      linkage analyses, and the copy number variations (CNVs) of the embryos were also 
      identified. Prenatal diagnosis was performed to validate the accuracy of PGT-M. 
      RESULTS: PGT-M was successfully performed on the three couples, and they accepted 
      the transfers of euploid blastocysts without the relevant pathogenic allele. The 
      clinical pregnancies were acquired and the prenatal diagnosis of the three 
      families confirmed the effectiveness of karyomapping. The three born babies were 
      healthy and free of the pathogenic alleles HTT, ATXN2, or PPP2R2B corresponding 
      to Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxias 2 or 12, respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: This study shows that karyomapping is a highly powerful and efficient 
      approach for dynamic mutation detection in preimplantation embryos. In this work, 
      we first report the birth of healthy babies that are free of the pathogenic gene 
      for dynamic mutation diseases in patients receiving PGT-M by karyomapping.

AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNA (miRNA) regulation is associated with several diseases, 
      including neurodegenerative diseases. Several approaches can be used for modeling 
      miRNA regulation. However, their precision may be limited for analyzing 
      multidimensional data. Here, we addressed this question by integrating shape 
      analysis and feature selection into miRAMINT, a methodology that we used for 
      analyzing multidimensional RNA-seq and proteomic data from a knock-in mouse model 
      (Hdh mice) of Huntington's disease (HD), a disease caused by CAG repeat expansion 
      in huntingtin (htt). This dataset covers 6 CAG repeat alleles and 3 age points in 
      the striatum and cortex of Hdh mice. RESULTS: Remarkably, compared to previous 
      analyzes of this multidimensional dataset, the miRAMINT approach retained only 31 
      explanatory striatal miRNA-mRNA pairs that are precisely associated with the 
      shape of CAG repeat dependence over time, among which 5 pairs with a strong 
      change of target expression levels. Several of these pairs were previously 
      associated with neuronal homeostasis or HD pathogenesis, or both. Such miRNA-mRNA 
      pairs were not detected in cortex. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that miRNA 
      regulation has a limited global role in HD while providing accurately-selected 
      miRNA-target pairs to study how the brain may compute molecular responses to HD 
      over time. These data also provide a methodological framework for researchers to 
      explore how shape analysis can enhance multidimensional data analytics in biology 
      and disease.

AB  - In many repeat diseases, such as Huntington's disease (HD), ongoing repeat 
      expansions in affected tissues contribute to disease onset, progression and 
      severity. Inducing contractions of expanded repeats by exogenous agents is not 
      yet possible. Traditional approaches would target proteins driving repeat 
      mutations. Here we report a compound, naphthyridine-azaquinolone (NA), that 
      specifically binds slipped-CAG DNA intermediates of expansion mutations, a 
      previously unsuspected target. NA efficiently induces repeat contractions in HD 
      patient cells as well as en masse contractions in medium spiny neurons of HD 
      mouse striatum. Contractions are specific for the expanded allele, independently 
      of DNA replication, require transcription across the coding CTG strand and arise 
      by blocking repair of CAG slip-outs. NA-induced contractions depend on active 
      expansions driven by MutSbeta. NA injections in HD mouse striatum reduce mutant HTT 
      protein aggregates, a biomarker of HD pathogenesis and severity. 
      Repeat-structure-specific DNA ligands are a novel avenue to contract expanded 
      repeats.

TI  - Ellagic acid rescues motor and cognitive deficits in the R6/2 mouse model of 
      Huntington's disease by lowering mutant huntingtin protein.
PG  - 1334-1348
LID - 10.1039/c9fo02131k [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      highly polymorphic CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion encoding an extended 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) tract at the N-terminus of huntingtin protein (HTT). The 
      polyQ tract promotes the formation of toxic oligomers and aggregates of HTT, 
      which leads to neuronal dysfunction and death. Therapies to lower mutant HTT 
      (mHTT) and its aggregates appear to be the most promising strategies. Ellagic 
      acid (EA) has been marketed as a dietary supplement with various claimed benefits 
      and neuroprotective effects on several neurodegenerative disorders, while its 
      effect on mHTT pathology is still unknown. Here we reported that EA significantly 
      attenuated motor and cognitive deficits in R6/2 mice. Moreover, EA significantly 
      lowered mHTT levels, reduced neuroinflammation, rescued synapse loss, and 
      decreased oxidative stress in R6/2 mouse brains. These findings indicated that EA 
      has promising therapeutic potential for HD treatment.

TI  - Frequency and distribution of polyQ disease intermediate-length repeat alleles in 
      healthy Italian population.
PG  - 1475-1482
LID - 10.1007/s10072-019-04233-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1-2-17 
      (SCA1-2-17) are adult-onset autosomal dominant diseases, caused by triplet repeat 
      expansions in the HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, and TBP genes. Alleles with a repeat number 
      just below the pathological threshold are associated with reduced penetrance and 
      meiotic instability and are defined as intermediate alleles (IAs). OBJECTIVES: We 
      aimed to determine the frequencies of IAs in healthy Italian subjects and to 
      compare the proportion of the IAs with the prevalence of the respective diseases. 
      METHODS: We analyzed the triplet repeat size in HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, and TBP genes 
      in the DNA samples from 729 consecutive adult healthy Italian subjects. RESULTS: 
      IAs associated with reduced penetrance were found in ATXN2 gene (1 subject, 0.1%) 
      and TBP gene (0.82%). IAs at risk for meiotic instability were found in HTT 
      (5.3%) and ATXN2 genes (2.7%). In ATXN1, we found a low percentage of IAs (0.4%). 
      Alleles lacking the common CAT interruption within the CAG sequence were also 
      rare (0.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The high frequencies of IAs in HTT and ATXN2 genes 
      suggest a correlation with the prevalence of the diseases in our population and 
      support the hypothesis that IAs could represent a reservoir of new pathological 
      expansions. On the opposite, ATXN1-IA were very rare in respect to the prevalence 
      of SCA1 in our country, and TBP- IA were more frequent than expected, suggesting 
      that other mechanisms could influence the occurrence of novel pathological 
      expansions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationships between the motor phenotype and the 
      presence of specific neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological disorders in 
      patients with early motor-manifest Huntington's disease (HD). METHODS: From the 
      Enroll-HD study, 3,505 individuals with HD who had </=5 years of motor symptoms 
      were classified based on the predefined parkinsonism/chorea index into 
      chorea-dominant (n = 1125), parkinsonism-dominant (n = 867), and mixed-motor 
      phenotype (n = 1513) groups. An analysis was performed on the results of the 
      short Problem Behaviors Assessment. This test assesses patients for 
      neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, irritability/aggression, apathy, 
      obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and psychosis as well as cognitive disorders by 
      using neuropsychological tests such as the Stroop Interference test, Trail Making 
      Test Part A and B, letter fluency, Symbol Digit Modality test, and animal fluency 
      test. RESULTS: In these early motor-manifest HD individuals, motor phenotype was 
      associated with neuropsychiatric and cognitive changes. Independent of the age of 
      motor onset, motor duration and severity, CAG repeat expansion, and medication 
      use, the parkinsonism-dominant group had more severe neuropsychiatric disorders 
      (depression, apathy, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and psychosis) and poorer 
      performance on all cognitive tests than those patients in the mixed-motor 
      phenotype and chorea-dominant groups. The patients in the chorea-dominant group 
      had less apathy and depression than those in the mixed-motor phenotype group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In the early stage of motor-manifest HD, parkinsonism-dominant 
      patients appear to have more severe neuropsychiatric disturbances and more 
      cognitive impairments than those HD patients with chorea-dominant and mixed-motor 
      phenotypes. Future studies should explore the brain mechanisms of these disorders 
      and the possible treatments. (c) 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant late-onset 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by an unstable cytosine-adenine-guanine 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Preimplantation 
      genetic testing (PGT) is a diagnostic procedure available for these individuals, 
      because they carry a high risk of transmitting this genetic condition to their 
      offspring. METHODS: Information about 15 HD couples referred for PGT and 21 
      cycles performed from 2009 to 2018 was collected retrospectively. PGT provide 
      direct testing of embryos obtained after intracytoplasmic sperm injection, using 
      polymerase chain reaction multiplex as the genetic testing protocol. RESULTS: PGT 
      for HD was performed in 15 couples, with no history of previous attempts, in a 
      total of 21 cycles. The mean number of biopsied embryos per cycle was 4.9. The 
      amplification efficiency in blastomeres was 87.4%. From the 90 amplified embryos, 
      32 were normal and suitable for transfer. The mean number of transferred embryos 
      per couple was 1.2.Overall, 3 positive human chorionic gonadotropin tests were 
      obtained in 3 couples, resulting in 2 clinical pregnancies. The 2 ongoing 
      clinical pregnancies had normal evolution, and culminated in 2 deliveries, 
      resulting in the birth of 2 healthy children. CONCLUSIONS: PGT for HD is 
      considered an effective and safe reproductive option for couples who are at risk 
      of transmitting HD, when proper genetic and reproductive counseling is warranted.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome, the leading heritable form of intellectual disability, is 
      caused by hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of large (CGG) repeat 
      expansions (> 200 repeats) in the 5' untranslated region of the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. As a consequence of FMR1 gene silencing, there is 
      little or no production of FMR1 protein (FMRP), an important element in normal 
      synaptic function. Although the absence of FMRP has long been known to be 
      responsible for the cognitive impairment in fragile X syndrome, the relationship 
      between FMRP level and cognitive ability (IQ) is only imprecisely understood. To 
      address this issue, a high-throughput, fluorescence resonance energy transfer 
      (FRET) assay has been used to quantify FMRP levels in dermal fibroblasts, and the 
      relationship between FMRP and IQ measures was assessed by statistical analysis in 
      a cohort of 184 individuals with CGG-repeat lengths spanning normal (< 45 CGGs) 
      to full mutation (> 200 CGGs) repeat ranges in fibroblasts. The principal 
      findings of the current study are twofold: i) For those with normal CGG repeats, 
      IQ is no longer sensitive to further increases in FMRP above an FMRP threshold of 
      ~70% of the mean FMRP level; below this threshold, IQ decreases steeply with 
      further decreases in FMRP; and ii) For the current cohort, a mean IQ of 85 (lower 
      bound for the normal IQ range) is attained for FMRP levels that are only ~35% of 
      the mean FMRP level among normal CGG-repeat controls. The current results should 
      help guide expectations for efforts to induce FMR1 gene activity and for the 
      levels of cognitive function expected for a given range of FMRP levels.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant progressive neurodegenerative 
      disorder, caused by a CAG/polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the 
      Huntingtin (HTT) gene. The polyQ tract is located in and transcribed from 
      N-terminal HTT of exon 1. HTT is a large multifaceted protein, which participates 
      in a range of cellular functions. Previous studies have shown that truncated HTT, 
      which lacks N-terminus, retains specific functions that can produce 
      neuroprotective benefits. It gives an insight that it is possible to repair HD by 
      removing deleterious N-terminal HTT with CRISPR/Cas9, without compromising 
      functions of remaining HTT peptides. To successfully generate functional 
      truncated HTT proteins, an alternative downstream ATG start codon that is capable 
      of initiating truncated HTT expression is required. In this study, we searched 
      all possible in-frame ATGs before exon 7 and demonstrated that one of them can 
      indeed initiate the downstream GFP expression in plasmids. We then tried to 
      remove endogenous N-terminal HTT with an optimized dual-sgRNA strategy by 
      CRISPR/Cas9; however, we cannot detect obvious traits of truncated HTT 
      expression. Our results suggest that noncanonical ATGs of N-terminal HTT may not 
      be effective in the genomic context, as in the construct context. Nevertheless, 
      our study examined the therapeutic efficacy of downstream noncanonical ATGs for 
      protein translation and also provided an optimized dual-sgRNA strategy for 
      further genome manipulation of the HTT gene.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder caused by poly Q 
      repeat expansion in the Huntingtin (Htt) gene. While the Htt amyloid aggregates 
      are known to affect many cellular processes, their role in translation has not 
      been addressed. Here we report that pathogenic Htt expression causes a protein 
      synthesis deficit in cells. We find a functional prion-like protein, the 
      translation regulator Orb2, to be sequestered by Htt aggregates in cells. 
      Co-expression of Orb2 can partially rescue the lethality associated with poly Q 
      expanded Htt. These findings can be relevant for HD as human homologs of Orb2 are 
      also sequestered by pathogenic Htt aggregates. Our work suggests that translation 
      dysfunction is one of the contributors to the pathogenesis of HD and new 
      therapies targeting protein synthesis pathways might help to alleviate disease 
      symptoms.

AB  - Alterations in protein folding may lead to aggregation of misfolded proteins, 
      which is strongly correlated with neurotoxicity and cell death. Protein 
      aggregation has been shown as a normal consequence of aging, but it is largely 
      associated with age-related disease, particularly neurodegenerative diseases like 
      Huntington disease (HD). HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin 
      gene and serves as a useful model for neurodegeneration due to its strictly 
      genetic origin. Research in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans suggests 
      that glucose protects against cell stress, including proteotoxicity related to 
      aggregation, despite the well-known, lifespan-shortening effects of glucose. We 
      hypothesized that glucose could be beneficial by alleviating energy deficiency, a 
      well-characterized phenomenon in HD. We used C. elegans expressing polyglutamine 
      repeats to quantify lifespan, motility, reproduction, learning, and activity of 
      succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), with and without glucose, to identify the role of 
      glucose in proteotoxicity and neuroprotection. Our data show poly-Q worms on 
      glucose plates exhibited shorter lifespans, no change in motility, learning, or 
      SDH product formation, but had altered reproductive phenotypes. Notably, worms 
      expressing toxic polyglutamine repeats were unable to learn association of food 
      with a neutral odorant, even early in life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin 
      (HTT) gene. No disease-modifying therapy exists for the treatment of patients 
      with HD. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate early disease 
      mechanisms that potentially could be used as a target therapeutically. METHODS: 
      Lymphocyte activity in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 4 cohorts of HTT gene 
      expansion carriers (n = 121 in total) and controls was analyzed by techniques 
      based on flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: The data 
      of this study provide evidence of immune abnormalities before motor onset of 
      disease. In CSF of HTT gene expansion carriers, we found increased levels of 
      proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-17, and increased consumption of the 
      lymphocyte growth factor IL-7 before motor onset of HD. In concordance, we 
      observed an increased prevalence of IL-17-producing Th17.1 cells in the CSF of 
      HTT gene expansion carriers, predominantly in pre-motor manifest individuals. The 
      frequency of intrathecal Th17.1 cells correlated negatively with progression of 
      HD and the level of neurodegeneration, suggesting a role of Th17.1 cells in the 
      early disease stage. We also observed a skewing in the balance between 
      proinflammatory and regulatory T cells potentially favoring a proinflammatory 
      intrathecal environment in HTT gene expansion carriers. INTERPRETATION: These 
      data suggest that Th17.1 cells are implicated in the earliest pathogenic phases 
      of HD and suggest that treatment to dampen T -cell-driven inflammation before 
      motor onset might be of benefit in HTT gene expansion carriers. ANN NEUROL

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's Disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion, resulting in a mutant huntingtin protein. While 
      it is now clear that astrocytes are affected by HD and significantly contribute 
      to neuronal dysfunction and pathogenesis, the alterations in the transcriptional 
      and epigenetic profiles in HD astrocytes have yet to be characterized. Here, we 
      examine global transcription and chromatin accessibility dynamics during in vitro 
      astrocyte differentiation in a transgenic non-human primate model of HD. RESULTS: 
      We found global changes in accessibility and transcription across different 
      stages of HD pluripotent stem cell differentiation, with distinct trends first 
      observed in neural progenitor cells (NPCs), once cells have committed to a neural 
      lineage. Transcription of p53 signaling and cell cycle pathway genes was highly 
      impacted during differentiation, with depletion in HD NPCs and upregulation in HD 
      astrocytes. E2F target genes also displayed this inverse expression pattern, and 
      strong associations between E2F target gene expression and accessibility at 
      nearby putative enhancers were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that 
      chromatin accessibility and transcription are altered throughout in vitro HD 
      astrocyte differentiation and provide evidence that E2F dysregulation contributes 
      to aberrant cell-cycle re-entry and apoptosis throughout the progression from 
      NPCs to astrocytes.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a lethal neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      expansion of a CAG repeat within the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Disease prevention 
      can be facilitated by preimplantation genetic testing for this monogenic disorder 
      (PGT-M). We developed a strategy for HD PGT-M, involving whole genome 
      amplification (WGA) followed by combined triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) for HTT CAG 
      repeat expansion detection and multi-microsatellite marker genotyping for disease 
      haplotype phasing. The strategy was validated and tested pre-clinically in a 
      simulated PGT-M case before clinical application in five cycles of a PGT-M case. 
      The assay reliably and correctly diagnosed all embryos, even where allele dropout 
      (ADO) occurred at the HTT CAG repeat locus or at one or more linked markers. Ten 
      of the 27 embryos analyzed were diagnosed as unaffected. Four embryo transfers 
      were performed, two of which involved fresh cycle double embryo transfers and two 
      were frozen-thawed single embryo transfers. Pregnancies were achieved from each 
      of the frozen-thawed single embryo transfers and confirmed to be unaffected by 
      amniocentesis, culminating in live births at term. This strategy enhances 
      diagnostic confidence for PGT-M of HD and can also be employed in situations 
      where disease haplotype phase cannot be established prior to the start of PGT-M.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion within exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene. HTT mRNA 
      contains 67 exons and does not always splice between exon 1 and exon 2 leading to 
      the production of a small polyadenylated HTTexon1 transcript, and the full-length 
      HTT mRNA has three 3'UTR isoforms. We have developed a QuantiGene multiplex panel 
      for the simultaneous detection of all of these mouse Htt transcripts directly 
      from tissue lysates and demonstrate that this can replace the more work-intensive 
      Taqman qPCR assays. We have applied this to the analysis of brain regions from 
      the zQ175 HD mouse model and wild type littermates at two months of age. We show 
      that the incomplete splicing of Htt occurs throughout the brain and confirm that 
      this originates from the mutant and not endogenous Htt allele. Given that 
      HTTexon1 encodes the highly pathogenic exon 1 HTT protein, it is essential that 
      the levels of all Htt transcripts can be monitored when evaluating HTT lowering 
      approaches. Our QuantiGene panel will allow the rapid comparative assessment of 
      all Htt transcripts in cell lysates and mouse tissues without the need to first 
      extract RNA.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by CAG repeat expansion within the HTT gene, 
      with the dysfunction and eventual loss of striatal medium spiny neurons a notable 
      feature. Since medium spiny neurons receive high amounts of synaptic input, we 
      hypothesised that this vulnerability originates from an inability to sustain 
      presynaptic performance during intense neuronal activity. To test this 
      hypothesis, primary cultures of either hippocampal or striatal neurons were 
      prepared from either wild-type mice or a knock-in HD mouse model which contains 
      140 poly-glutamine repeats in the huntingtin protein (htt(Q140/Q140)). We 
      identified a striatum-specific defect in synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis in 
      htt(Q140/Q140) neurons that was only revealed during high frequency stimulation. 
      This dysfunction was also present in neurons that were heterozygous for the 
      mutant HTT allele. Depletion of endogenous huntingtin using 
      hydrophobically-modified siRNA recapitulated this activity-dependent defect in 
      wild-type neurons, whereas depletion of mutant huntingtin did not rescue the 
      effect in htt(Q140/Q140) neurons. Importantly, this SV endocytosis defect was 
      corrected by overexpression of wild-type huntingtin in homozygous htt(Q140/Q140) 
      neurons. Therefore, we have identified an activity-dependent and 
      striatum-specific signature of presynaptic dysfunction in neurons derived from 
      pre-symptomatic HD mice, which is due to loss of wild-type huntingtin function. 
      This presynaptic defect may render this specific neuronal subtype unable to 
      operate efficiently during high frequency activity patterns, potentially 
      resulting in dysfunctional neurotransmission, synapse failure and ultimately 
      degeneration.

TI  - A genetic association study of glutamine-encoding DNA sequence structures,

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is caused by an unstable CAG/CAA repeat 
      expansion encoding a toxic polyglutamine tract. Here, we tested the hypotheses 
      that HD outcomes are impacted by somatic expansion of, and polymorphisms within, 
      the HTT CAG/CAA glutamine-encoding repeat, and DNA repair genes. METHODS: The 
      sequence of the glutamine-encoding repeat and the proportion of somatic CAG 
      expansions in blood DNA from participants inheriting 40 to 50 CAG repeats within 
      the TRACK-HD and Enroll-HD cohorts were determined using high-throughput 
      ultra-deep-sequencing. Candidate gene polymorphisms were genotyped using 
      kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP). Genotypic associations were assessed 
      using time-to-event and regression analyses. FINDINGS: Using data from 203 
      TRACK-HD and 531 Enroll-HD participants, we show that individuals with higher 
      blood DNA somatic CAG repeat expansion scores have worse HD outcomes: a one-unit 
      increase in somatic expansion score was associated with a Cox hazard ratio for 
      motor onset of 3.05 (95% CI...=...1.94 to 4.80, p...=...1.3 x 10(-6)). We also show that 
      individual-specific somatic expansion scores are associated with variants in FAN1 
      (pFDR...=...4.8...x...10(-6)), MLH3 (pFDR...=...8.0...x...10(-4)), MLH1 (pFDR...=...0.004) and MSH3 
      (pFDR...=...0.009). We also show that HD outcomes are best predicted by the number of 
      pure CAGs rather than total encoded-glutamines. INTERPRETATION: These data 
      establish pure CAG length, rather than encoded-glutamine, as the key inherited 
      determinant of downstream pathophysiology. These findings have implications for 
      HD diagnostics, and support somatic expansion as a mechanistic link for genetic 
      modifiers of clinical outcomes, a driver of disease, and potential therapeutic 
      target in HD and related repeat expansion disorders. FUNDING: CHDI Foundation.

TI  - Expanded polyglutamine impairs normal nuclear distribution of fused in sarcoma

PG  - 358-367
LID - 10.1111/neup.12600 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
      polyglutamine repeat expansion in the huntingtin protein. Immunohistochemical 
      studies using the 1C2 antibody for polyglutamine expansion have detected 
      characteristic intranuclear inclusions (INIs) in affected neurons in HD. Further, 
      in vitro and mouse models of HD have shown that the INIs recruit several proteins 
      relating to RNA splicing and translation. In the present study, we 
      immunohistochemically investigated the association of INIs with various 
      heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins in the cerebral cortex of four autopsy 
      cases of HD. Fused in sarcoma (FUS) was colocalized with 1C2-positive nuclear 
      inclusions in all examined cases. Localization of poly (rC)-binding protein 1 
      (PCBP1) in 1C2-positive nuclear inclusions was also observed. Double 
      immunofluorescence revealed complete or partial loss of the normal, diffuse 
      nuclear distribution of FUS or PCBP1 in neurons with 1C2-positive nuclear 
      inclusions. This maldistribution of FUS in cortical neurons suggests a severe 
      disturbance of messenger RNA processing, which may be a common pathogenetic 
      mechanism of FUS-related familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

TI  - Recurrent homozygous damaging mutation in TMX2, encoding a protein disulfide 
      isomerase, in four families with microlissencephaly.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) proteins are part of the 
      thioredoxin protein superfamily. PDIs are involved in the formation and 
      rearrangement of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues during protein folding 
      in the endoplasmic reticulum and are implicated in stress response pathways. 
      METHODS: Eight children from four consanguineous families residing in distinct 
      geographies within the Middle East and Central Asia were recruited for study. All 
      probands showed structurally similar microcephaly with lissencephaly 
      (microlissencephaly) brain malformations. DNA samples from each family underwent 
      whole exome sequencing, assessment for repeat expansions and confirmatory 
      segregation analysis. RESULTS: An identical homozygous variant in TMX2 
      (c.500G>A), encoding thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein 2, segregated with 
      disease in all four families. This variant changed the last coding base of exon 
      6, and impacted mRNA stability. All patients presented with microlissencephaly, 
      global developmental delay, intellectual disability and epilepsy. While TMX2 is 
      an activator of cellular C9ORF72 repeat expansion toxicity, patients showed no 
      evidence of C9ORF72 repeat expansions. CONCLUSION: The TMX2 c.500G>A allele 
      associates with recessive microlissencephaly, and patients show no evidence of 
      C9ORF72 expansions. TMX2 is the first PDI implicated in a recessive disease, 
      suggesting a protein isomerisation defect in microlissencephaly.

TI  - Tracking Expansions of Stable and Threshold Length Trinucleotide Repeat Tracts In 
      Vivo and In Vitro Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 25-68

AB  - Trinucleotide repeat (TNR) tracts are inherently unstable during DNA replication, 
      leading to repeat expansions and/or contractions. Expanded tracts are the cause 
      of over 40 neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. In this chapter, we 
      focus on the (CAG)(n) and (CTG)(n) repeat sequences that, when expanded, lead to 
      Huntington's disease (HD) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), respectively, as 
      well as a number of other neurodegenerative diseases. TNR tracts in most 
      individuals are relatively small and stable in terms of length. However, TNR 
      tracts become increasingly prone to expansion as tract length increases, 
      eventually leading to very long tracts that disrupt coding (e.g. HD) or noncoding 
      (e.g., DM1) regions of the genome. It is important to understand the early stages 
      in TNR expansions, that is, the transition from small, stable lengths to 
      susceptible threshold lengths. We describe PCR-based in vivo assays, using the 
      model system Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to determine and characterize the dynamic 
      behavior of TNR tracts in the stable and threshold ranges. We also describe a 
      simple in vitro system to assess tract dynamics during 5' single-stranded DNA 
      (ssDNA) flap processing and to assess the role of different DNA metabolism 
      proteins in these dynamics. These assays can ultimately be used to determine 
      factors that influence the early stages of TNR tract expansion.

AB  - The expanded CAG repeat results in somatic mosaicism and genetic anticipation in 
      Huntington's disease (HD). Here we report a longitudinal study examining CAG 
      repeat instability in lymphocytes and sperm of three HD monkeys throughout their 
      whole life-span that encompass the prodromal to symptomatic stages of HD. We 
      demonstrate a progressive increase in CAG repeat length in lymphocytes and sperm 
      as the animals aged. We also examined the impact of CAG repeat length on 
      expansion rate, which showed a clear linear correlation up to 62Q, and high 
      instability after. Our findings stress the importance of further investigation in 
      CAG instability in peripheral blood cells longitudinally.

AB  - Although the heritability of cognitive function in old age is substantial, 
      genome-wide association studies have had limited success in elucidating its 
      genetic basis, leaving a considerable amount of "missing heritability." Aside 
      from single nucleotide polymorphisms, genome-wide association studies are unable 
      to assess other large sources of genetic variation, such as tandem repeat 
      polymorphisms. Therefore, here, we studied the association of 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat variations in polyglutamine 
      disease-associated genes (PDAGs) with cognitive function in older adults. In a 
      large cohort consisting of 5786 participants, we found that the CAG repeat number 
      in 3 PDAGs (TBP, HTT, and AR) were significantly associated with the decline in 
      cognitive function, which together accounted for 0.49% of the variation. 
      Furthermore, in an magnetic resonance imaging substudy, we found that CAG repeat 
      polymorphisms in 4 PDAGs (ATXN2, CACNA1A, ATXN7, and AR) were associated with 
      different imaging characteristics, including brain stem, putamen, globus 
      pallidus, thalamus, and amygdala volumes. Our findings indicate that tandem 
      repeat polymorphisms are associated with cognitive function in older adults and 
      highlight the importance of PDAGs in elucidating its missing heritability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The expression of the HTT CAG repeat expansion mutation causes 
      neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (HD). OBJECTIVES: In light of the - 
      mainly in-vitro - evidence suggesting an additional role of huntingtin in 
      neurodevelopment we used 3T MRI to test the hypothesis that in CAG-expanded 
      individuals without clinical signs of HD (preHD) there is evidence for 
      neurodevelopmental abnormalities. METHODS: We specifically investigated the 
      complexity of cortical folding, a measure of cortical neurodevelopment, employing 
      a novel method to quantify local fractal dimension (FD) measures that uses 
      spherical harmonic reconstructions. RESULTS: The complexity of cortical folding 
      differed at a group level between preHD (n...=...57) and healthy volunteers (n...=...57) 
      in areas of the motor and visual system as well as temporal cortical areas. 
      However, there was no association between the complexity of cortical folding and 
      the loss in putamen volume that was clearly evident in preHD. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results suggest that HTT CAG repeat length may have an influence on cortical 
      folding without evidence that this leads to developmental pathology or was 
      clinically meaningful. This suggests that the HTT CAG-repeat expansion mutation 
      may influence the processes governing cortical neurodevelopment; however, that 
      influence seems independent of the events that lead to neurodegeneration.

TI  - Composition of the Intranuclear Inclusions of Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia 
      Syndrome.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative 
      disorder associated with a premutation repeat expansion (55-200 CGG repeats) in 
      the 5' noncoding region of the FMR1 gene. Solitary intranuclear inclusions within 
      FXTAS neurons and astrocytes constitute a hallmark of the disorder, yet our 
      understanding of how and why these bodies form is limited. Here, we have 
      discovered that FXTAS inclusions emit a distinct autofluorescence spectrum, which 
      forms the basis of a novel, unbiased method for isolating FXTAS inclusions by 
      preparative fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Using a combination of 
      autofluorescence-based FACS and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomics, we have identified more than two hundred proteins 
      that are enriched within the inclusions relative to FXTAS whole nuclei. Whereas 
      no single protein species dominates inclusion composition, highly enriched levels 
      of conjugated small ubiquitin-related modifier 2 (SUMO 2) protein and 
      p62/sequestosome-1 (p62/SQSTM1) protein were found within the inclusions. Many 
      additional proteins involved with RNA binding, protein turnover, and DNA damage 
      repair were enriched within inclusions relative to total nuclear protein. The 
      current analysis has also allowed the first direct detection, through peptide 
      sequencing, of endogenous FMRpolyG peptide, the product of repeat-associated 
      non-ATG (RAN) translation of the FMR1 mRNA. However, this peptide was found only 
      at extremely low levels and not within whole FXTAS nuclear preparations, raising 
      the question whether endogenous RAN products exist at quantities sufficient to 
      contribute to FXTAS pathogenesis. The abundance of the inclusion-associated 
      ubiquitin- and SUMO-based modifiers supports a model for inclusion formation as 
      the result of increased protein loads and elevated oxidative stress leading to 
      maladaptive autophagy. These results highlight the need to further investigate 
      FXTAS pathogenesis in the context of endogenous systems.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a currently incurable and, ultimately, fatal 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion within 
      exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which results in the production of a mutant 
      protein that forms inclusions and selectively destroys neurons in the striatum 
      and other adjacent structures. The RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease from CRISPR-Cas9 
      systems is a versatile technology for inducing DNA double-strand breaks that can 
      stimulate the introduction of frameshift-inducing mutations and permanently 
      disable mutant gene function. Here, we show that the Cas9 nuclease from 
      Staphylococcus aureus, a small Cas9 ortholog that can be packaged alongside a 
      single guide RNA into a single adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, can be used 
      to disrupt the expression of the mutant HTT gene in the R6/2 mouse model of HD 
      following its in vivo delivery to the striatum. Specifically, we found that 
      CRISPR-Cas9-mediated disruption of the mutant HTT gene resulted in a  approximately 50% 
      decrease in neuronal inclusions and significantly improved lifespan and certain 
      motor deficits. These results thus illustrate the potential for CRISPR-Cas9 
      technology to treat HD and other autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorders 
      caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion via in vivo genome editing.

AB  - Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACDMPV) is a 
      rare lethal lung developmental disease. Affected infants manifest with severe 
      respiratory distress and refractory pulmonary hypertension and uniformly die in 
      the first month of life. Heterozygous point mutations or copy-number variant 
      deletions involving FOXF1 and/or its upstream lung-specific enhancer on 16q24.1 
      have been identified in the vast majority of ACDMPV patients. We have previously 
      described two unrelated families with a de novo pathogenic frameshift variant 
      c.691_698del (p.Ala231Argfs*61) in the exon 1 of FOXF1. Here, we present a third 
      unrelated ACDMPV family with the same de novo variant and propose that a direct 
      tandem repeat of eight consecutive nucleotides GCGGCGGC within the ~4 kb CpG 
      island in FOXF1 exon 1 is a novel mutation hotspot causative for ACDMPV.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized 
      by a clinical triad of motor, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. HD is caused by 
      a CAG repeat expansion in the gene encoding the huntingtin protein. Homozygosity 
      for the HD-causing mutation is extremely rare; thus, the majority of HD patients 
      express the mutant huntingtin protein in addition to reduced levels of the 
      non-pathogenic huntingtin protein. Deficits in synaptic plasticity, including 
      hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), have been identified in various mouse 
      models of HD and are thought to contribute to the debilitating cognitive symptoms 
      associated with the disease. However, the bulk of these studies used N-terminal 
      fragment or homozygous knock-in mouse models of HD at symptomatic ages, and our 
      understanding of the onset and progression of synaptic plasticity deficits in the 
      HD brain is lacking. To better understand the time-course of synaptic plasticity 
      deficits in HD, as well as the impact of heterozygous and homozygous huntingtin 
      mutations, we quantified basal synaptic connectivity, presynaptic release 
      probability, presynaptically mediated post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) and 
      postsynaptically mediated LTP at presymptomatic, early symptomatic and late 
      symptomatic ages in heterozygous and homozygous Q175FDN knock-in HD mice. Our 
      results demonstrate clear age-dependent effects of the HD-causing mutation on 
      both short and long-term plasticity that generally emerge earlier in homozygous 
      mice. Interestingly, deficits in presynaptic short-term plasticity were more 
      closely linked to disease progression than deficits in postsynaptic LTP, and 
      heterozygous mice were more susceptible to an LTP deficit when induced by high 
      frequency stimulation compared to theta burst stimulation. To the best of our 
      knowledge, the present study represents the most thorough characterization to 
      date of the onset and progression of hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficits in 
      a mouse model of HD, and should prove valuable to future studies exploring 
      cellular mechanisms underlying the debilitating cognitive decline in HD.

TI  - Increased translation as a novel pathogenic mechanism in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 3158-3175
LID - 10.1093/brain/awz230 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene. Striatal projection neurons are 
      mainly affected, leading to motor symptoms, but molecular mechanisms involved in 
      their vulnerability are not fully characterized. Here, we show that eIF4E binding 
      protein (4E-BP), a protein that inhibits translation, is inactivated in 
      Huntington's disease striatum by increased phosphorylation. Accordingly, we 
      detected aberrant de novo protein synthesis. Proteomic characterization indicates 
      that translation specifically affects sets of proteins as we observed 
      upregulation of ribosomal and oxidative phosphorylation proteins and 
      downregulation of proteins related to neuronal structure and function. 
      Interestingly, treatment with the translation inhibitor 4EGI-1 prevented R6/1 
      mice motor deficits, although corticostriatal long-term depression was not 
      markedly changed in behaving animals. At the molecular level, injection of 4EGI-1 
      normalized protein synthesis and ribosomal content in R6/1 mouse striatum. In 
      conclusion, our results indicate that dysregulation of protein synthesis is 
      involved in mutant huntingtin-induced striatal neuron dysfunction.

TI  - RPS25 is required for efficient RAN translation of C9orf72 and other 
      neurodegenerative disease-associated nucleotide repeats.
PG  - 1383-1388
LID - 10.1038/s41593-019-0455-7 [doi]
AB  - Nucleotide repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene are the most common cause of 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Unconventional 
      translation (RAN translation) of C9orf72 repeats generates dipeptide repeat 
      proteins that can cause neurodegeneration. We performed a genetic screen for 
      regulators of RAN translation and identified small ribosomal protein subunit 25 
      (RPS25), presenting a potential therapeutic target for C9orf72-related 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia and other 
      neurodegenerative diseases caused by nucleotide repeat expansions.

AB  - The gut microbiota is important for maintaining homeostasis of the host. Gut 
      microbes represent the initial site for toxicant processing following dietary 
      exposures to environmental contaminants. The diet is the primary route of 
      exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which are absorbed via the gut, and 
      subsequently interfere with neurodevelopment and behavior. Developmental 
      exposures to PCBs have been linked to increased risk of neurodevelopmental 
      disorders (NDD), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which are also 
      associated with a high prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) distress and 
      intestinal dysbiosis. We hypothesized that developmental PCB exposure impacts 
      colonization of the gut microbiota, resulting in GI pathophysiology, in a 
      genetically susceptible host. Mouse dams expressing two heritable human mutations 
      (double mutants [DM]) that result in abnormal Ca(2+) dynamics and produce 
      behavioral deficits (gain of function mutation in the ryanodine receptor 1 
      [T4826I-RYR1] and a human CGG repeat expansion [170-200 CGG repeats] in the 
      fragile X mental retardation gene 1 [FMR1 premutation]). DM and congenic wild 
      type (WT) controls were exposed to PCBs (0-6...mg/kg/d) in the diet starting 2 
      weeks before gestation and continuing through postnatal day 21 (P21). Intestinal 
      physiology (Ussing chambers), inflammation (qPCR) and gut microbiome (16S 
      sequencing) studies were performed in offspring mice (P28-P30). Developmental 
      exposure to PCBs in the maternal diet caused significant mucosal barrier defects 
      in ileum and colon (increased secretory state and tight junction permeability) of 
      juvenile DM mice. Furthermore, PCB exposure increased the intestinal inflammatory 
      profile (Il6, Il1beta, and Il22), and resulted in dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, 
      including altered beta-diversity, in juvenile DM mice developmentally exposed to 
      1...mg/kg/d PCBs when compared to WT controls. Collectively, these findings 
      demonstrate a novel interaction between PCB exposure and the gut microbiota in a 
      genetically susceptible host that provide novel insight into environmental risk 
      factors for neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion within the coding sequence of the HTT gene, 
      resulting in a highly toxic protein with an expanded polyglutamine stretch that 
      forms typical protein aggregates throughout the brain. We generated human induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from two HD patients using non-integrating Sendai 
      virus (SeV). The hiPSCs display a normal karyotype, express all pluripotency 
      markers, have the same CAG repeat expansion as the original fibroblasts and are 
      able to differentiate into the three germ layers in vitro.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the gene encoding the huntingtin protein (HTT). This expansion leads 
      to the formation of mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) that is expressed in many 
      body tissue cells. The mHTT interacts with several molecular pathways within 
      different cell types, affecting the regulation of the immune system cells. It is 
      still very limited the understanding of the immune changes in peripheral tissues 
      in HD. Herein, we investigated the levels of inflammatory and regulatory 
      cytokines in peripheral organs (i.e. kidney, heart, liver and spleen) of the 
      12-month-old BACHD model of HD. This robust murine model closely resembles the 
      human disease. We found significant changes in cytokine levels in all organs 
      analyzed. Increased levels of IL-6 were found in the kidney, while levels of IL-6 
      and IL-12p70 were increased in the heart of BACHD mice in comparison with 
      wild-type (WT) animals. In the liver, we observed enhanced IL-12p70 and TNF-alpha 
      levels. In the spleen, there was an increase in the levels of IL-4 and a decrease 
      in the levels of IL-5 and IL-6 in BACHD compared to WT. Our findings provide the 
      first evidence that the BACHD model also exhibits immune changes in peripheral 
      organs, opening an avenue for the investigation of the potential role played by 
      peripheral inflammatory response in HD. Further studies are needed to 
      systematically address the mechanisms and pathways underlying immune signaling in 
      peripheral organs in HD.

AB  - Genomic technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) are revolutionizing 
      molecular diagnostics and clinical medicine. However, these approaches have 
      proven inefficient at identifying pathogenic repeat expansions. Here, we apply a 
      collection of bioinformatics tools that can be utilized to identify either known 
      or novel expanded repeat sequences in NGS data. We performed genetic studies of a 
      cohort of 35 individuals from 22 families with a clinical diagnosis of cerebellar 
      ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). 
      Analysis of whole-genome sequence (WGS) data with five independent algorithms 
      identified a recessively inherited intronic repeat expansion [(AAGGG)(exp)] in 
      the gene encoding Replication Factor C1 (RFC1). This motif, not reported in the 
      reference sequence, localized to an Alu element and replaced the reference 
      (AAAAG)(11) short tandem repeat. Genetic analyses confirmed the pathogenic 
      expansion in 18 of 22 CANVAS-affected families and identified a core ancestral 
      haplotype, estimated to have arisen in Europe more than twenty-five thousand 
      years ago. WGS of the four RFC1-negative CANVAS-affected families identified 
      plausible variants in three, with genomic re-diagnosis of SCA3, spastic ataxia of 
      the Charlevoix-Saguenay type, and SCA45. This study identified the genetic basis 
      of CANVAS and demonstrated that these improved bioinformatics tools increase the 
      diagnostic utility of WGS to determine the genetic basis of a heterogeneous group 
      of clinically overlapping neurogenetic disorders.

AB  - The mismatch repair gene MSH3 has been implicated as a genetic modifier of the 
      CAG.CTG repeat expansion disorders Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy 
      type 1. A recent Huntington's disease genome-wide association study found 
      rs557874766, an imputed single nucleotide polymorphism located within a 
      polymorphic 9 bp tandem repeat in MSH3/DHFR, as the variant most significantly 
      associated with progression in Huntington's disease. Using Illumina sequencing in 
      Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy type 1 subjects, we show that 
      rs557874766 is an alignment artefact, the minor allele for which corresponds to a 
      three-repeat allele in MSH3 exon 1 that is associated with a reduced rate of 
      somatic CAG.CTG expansion (P = 0.004) and delayed disease onset (P = 0.003) in 
      both Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy type 1, and slower progression 
      (P = 3.86 x 10-7) in Huntington's disease. RNA-Seq of whole blood in the 
      Huntington's disease subjects found that repeat variants are associated with MSH3 
      and DHFR expression. A transcriptome-wide association study in the Huntington's 
      disease cohort found increased MSH3 and DHFR expression are associated with 
      disease progression. These results suggest that variation in the MSH3 exon 1 
      repeat region influences somatic expansion and disease phenotype in Huntington's 
      disease and myotonic dystrophy type 1, and suggests a common DNA repair mechanism 
      operates in both repeat expansion diseases.

TI  - Lowering Mutant Huntingtin Using Tricyclo-DNA Antisense Oligonucleotides As a 
      Therapeutic Approach for Huntington's Disease.
PG  - 256-265
LID - 10.1089/nat.2018.0775 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the first exon of huntingtin gene (HTT) encoding for a toxic 
      polyglutamine protein. This disease is characterized by motor, psychiatric, and 
      cognitive impairments. Currently, there is no disease modifying treatment. 
      However, reducing the expression of the huntingtin protein (HTT) using antisense 
      oligonucleotides (ASOs) has been shown as a promising therapeutic strategy. In 
      this study, we explore the therapeutic potential of ASO made of tricyclo-DNA 
      (tcDNA), a conformationally constrained DNA analog, to silence HTT. We used a 
      gapmer ASO, containing central DNA nucleotides flanked by tcDNA modifications on 
      5' and 3' ends, allowing the recruitment of RNAse H and subsequent degradation of 
      the messenger RNA. After transfection of tcDNA-ASO in patient-derived fibroblast 
      cell lines, we show a strong decrease of HTT mRNA and protein levels. As a 
      control, 2'O-methyl-RNA targeting the same region of HTT was also tested and did 
      not induce a significant effect. tcDNA-ASO were also evaluated in vivo in the 
      YAC128 mice, containing the full-length human HTT gene with 128 CAG repeat 
      expansion. Single intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of tcDNA induce a 
      significant decrease of HTT messenger and protein levels in the cortex, 
      hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum of treated mice. tcDNA-ASO were found well 
      distributed in the central nervous system (CNS) and show long lasting effect with 
      protein levels still low, 12 weeks after a single ICV injection. This proof of 
      concept study suggests the therapeutic potential of gapmer tcDNA ASO to 
      downregulate huntingtin in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Huntington's disease is caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the 
      huntingtin protein which affects the function and folding of the protein, and 
      results in intracellular protein aggregates. Here, we examined whether this 
      mutation leads to altered ubiquitination of huntingtin and other proteins in both 
      soluble and insoluble fractions of brain lysates of the Q175 knock-in 
      Huntington's disease mouse model and the Q20 wild-type mouse model. 
      Ubiquitination sites are detected by identification of Gly-Gly (diGly) remnant 
      motifs that remain on modified lysine residues after digestion. We identified K6, 
      K9, K132, K804, and K837 as endogenous ubiquitination sites of soluble 
      huntingtin, with wild-type huntingtin being mainly ubiquitinated at K132, K804, 
      and K837. Mutant huntingtin protein levels were strongly reduced in the soluble 
      fraction whereas K6 and K9 were mainly ubiquitinated. In the insoluble fraction 
      increased levels of huntingtin K6 and K9 diGly sites were observed for mutant 
      huntingtin as compared with wild type. Besides huntingtin, proteins with various 
      roles, including membrane organization, transport, mRNA processing, gene 
      transcription, translation, catabolic processes and oxidative phosphorylation, 
      were differently expressed or ubiquitinated in wild-type and mutant huntingtin 
      brain tissues. Correlating protein and diGly site fold changes in the soluble 
      fraction revealed that diGly site abundances of most of the proteins were not 
      related to protein fold changes, indicating that these proteins were 
      differentially ubiquitinated in the Q175 mice. In contrast, both the fold change 
      of the protein level and diGly site level were increased for several proteins in 
      the insoluble fraction, including ubiquitin, ubiquilin-2, sequestosome-1/p62 and 
      myo5a. Our data sheds light on putative novel proteins involved in different 
      cellular processes as well as their ubiquitination status in Huntington's 
      disease, which forms the basis for further mechanistic studies to understand the 
      role of differential ubiquitination of huntingtin and ubiquitin-regulated 
      processes in Huntington's disease.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a rare, hereditary, neurodegenerative and dominantly 
      transmitted disorder affecting about 10 out of 100,000 people in Western 
      Countries. The genetic cause is a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene 
      (HTT), which is unstable and may further increase its length in subsequent 
      generations, so called anticipation. Mutation repeat length coupled with other 
      gene modifiers and environmental factors contribute to the age at onset in the 
      offspring. Considering the unpredictability of age at onset and of clinical 
      prognosis in HD, the accurate interpretation, a proper psychological support and 
      a scientifically sound and compassionate communication of the genetic test result 
      are crucial in the context of Good Clinical Practice and when considering further 
      potential disease-modifying therapies. We discuss various genetic test scenarios 
      that require a particularly careful attention in psychological and genetic 
      counseling and expect that the counseling procedures will require a constant 
      update.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the Huntingtin gene (HTT), translated into a Huntingtin protein with 
      a polyglutamine expansion. There is preferential loss of medium spiny neurons 
      within the striatum and cortical pyramidal neurons. Pridopidine is a small 
      molecule showing therapeutic potential in HD preclinical and clinical studies. 
      Pridopidine has nanomolar affinity to the sigma-1 receptor (sigma-1R), which is 
      located predominantly at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial 
      associated ER membrane, and activates neuroprotective pathways. Here we evaluate 
      the neuroprotective effects of pridopidine against mutant Huntingtin toxicity in 
      mouse and human derived in vitro cell models. We also investigate the involvement 
      of the sigma-1 receptor in the mechanism of pridopidine. Pridopidine protects 
      mutant Huntingtin transfected mouse primary striatal and cortical neurons, with 
      an EC50 in the mid nanomolar range, as well as HD patient-derived induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This protection by pridopidine is blocked by 
      NE-100, a purported sigma-1 receptor antagonist, and not blocked by ANA-12, a 
      reported TrkB receptor antagonist. 3PPP, a documented sigma-1 receptor agonist, 
      shows similar neuroprotective effects. Genetic knock out of the sigma-1 receptor 
      dramatically decreases protection from pridopidine and 3PPP, but not protection 
      via brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The neuroprotection afforded by 
      pridopidine in our HD cell models is robust and sigma-1 receptor dependent. These 
      studies support the further development of pridopidine, and other sigma-1 
      receptor agonists as neuroprotective agents for HD and perhaps for other 
      disorders.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin 
      (HTT) gene. Although the length of this repeat is inversely correlated with age 
      of onset (AOO), it does not fully explain the variability in AOO. We assessed the 
      sequence downstream of the CAG repeat in HTT [reference: (CAG)n-CAA-CAG], since 
      variants within this region have been previously described, but no study of AOO 
      has been performed. These analyses identified a variant that results in complete 
      loss of interrupting (LOI) adenine nucleotides in this region [(CAG)n-CAG-CAG]. 
      Analysis of multiple HD pedigrees showed that this LOI variant is associated with 
      dramatically earlier AOO (average of 25 years) despite the same polyglutamine 
      length as in individuals with the interrupting penultimate CAA codon. This LOI 
      allele is particularly frequent in persons with reduced penetrance alleles who 
      manifest with HD and increases the likelihood of presenting clinically with HD 
      with a CAG of 36-39 repeats. Further, we show that the LOI variant is associated 
      with increased somatic repeat instability, highlighting this as a significant 
      driver of this effect. These findings indicate that the number of uninterrupted 
      CAG repeats, which is lengthened by the LOI, is the most significant contributor 
      to AOO of HD and is more significant than polyglutamine length, which is not 
      altered in these individuals. In addition, we identified another variant in this 
      region, where the CAA-CAG sequence is duplicated, which was associated with later 
      AOO. Identification of these cis-acting modifiers have potentially important 
      implications for genetic counselling in HD-affected families.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the gene encoding the 
      huntingtin (Htt) protein, which results in a protein containing an abnormally 
      expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) sequence. The expanded polyQ in the Htt protein is 
      toxic to brain cells. No therapy exists to delay disease progression. METHODS: 
      This study describes a gene-liposome system that synergistically applied focused 
      ultrasound (FUS)-blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening for rescuing motor and 
      neuropathological impairments when administered from pre to post-symptomatic 
      transgenic mouse models of HD. DPPC liposomes (LPs) are designed to carry glia 
      cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) plasmid DNA (GDNFp) to form a 
      GDNFp-liposome (GDNFp-LPs) complex. Pulsed FUS exposure with microbubbles (MBs) 
      was used to induce BBB opening for non-viral, non-invasive, and targeted gene 
      delivery into the central nervous system (CNS) for therapeutic purposes. RESULTS: 
      FUS-gene therapy significantly improved motor performance with GDNFp-LPs + FUS 
      treated HD mice equilibrating longer periods in the animal behavior. Reflecting 
      the improvements observed in motor function, GDNF overexpression results in 
      significantly decreased formation of polyglutamine-expanded aggregates, reduced 
      oxidative stress and apoptosis, promoted neurite outgrowth, and improved neuronal 
      survival. Immunoblotting and histological staining further confirmed the 
      neuroprotective effect from delivery of GDNF genes to neuronal cells. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the GDNFp-LPs plus FUS sonication can 
      provide an effective gene therapy to achieve local extravasation and triggered 
      gene delivery for non-invasive in vivo treatment of CNS diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in HTT, resulting in a 
      mutant huntingtin protein. IONIS-HTT(Rx) (hereafter, HTT(Rx)) is an antisense 
      oligonucleotide designed to inhibit HTT messenger RNA and thereby reduce 
      concentrations of mutant huntingtin. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, 
      double-blind, multiple-ascending-dose, phase 1-2a trial involving adults with 
      early Huntington's disease. Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to 
      receive HTT(Rx) or placebo as a bolus intrathecal administration every 4 weeks 
      for four doses. Dose selection was guided by a preclinical model in mice and 
      nonhuman primates that related dose level to reduction in the concentration of 
      huntingtin. The primary end point was safety. The secondary end point was HTT(Rx) 
      pharmacokinetics in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Prespecified exploratory end 
      points included the concentration of mutant huntingtin in CSF. RESULTS: Of the 46 
      patients who were enrolled in the trial, 34 were randomly assigned to receive 
      HTT(Rx) (at ascending dose levels of 10 to 120 mg) and 12 were randomly assigned 
      to receive placebo. Each patient received all four doses and completed the trial. 
      Adverse events, all of grade 1 or 2, were reported in 98% of the patients. No 
      serious adverse events were seen in HTT(Rx)-treated patients. There were no 
      clinically relevant adverse changes in laboratory variables. Predose (trough) 
      concentrations of HTT(Rx) in CSF showed dose dependence up to doses of 60 mg. 
      HTT(Rx) treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the concentration of 
      mutant huntingtin in CSF (mean percentage change from baseline, 10% in the 
      placebo group and -20%, -25%, -28%, -42%, and -38% in the HTT(Rx) 10-mg, 30-mg, 
      60-mg, 90-mg, and 120-mg dose groups, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal 
      administration of HTT(Rx) to patients with early Huntington's disease was not 
      accompanied by serious adverse events. We observed dose-dependent reductions in 
      concentrations of mutant huntingtin. (Funded by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and F.

TI  - AAV5-miHTT Gene Therapy Demonstrates Sustained Huntingtin Lowering and Functional 
      Improvement in Huntington Disease Mouse Models.
PG  - 334-343
LID - 10.1016/j.omtm.2019.03.002 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by an 
      autosomal dominant CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. The 
      translated expanded polyglutamine repeat in the HTT protein is known to cause 
      toxic gain of function. We showed previously that strong HTT lowering prevented 
      neuronal dysfunction in HD rodents and minipigs after single intracranial 
      injection of adeno-associated viral vector serotype 5 expressing a microRNA 
      targeting human HTT (AAV5-miHTT). To evaluate long-term efficacy, AAV5-miHTT was 
      injected into the striatum of knockin Q175 HD mice, and the mice were sacrificed 
      12 months post-injection. AAV5-miHTT caused a dose-dependent and sustained HTT 
      protein reduction with subsequent suppression of mutant HTT aggregate formation 
      in the striatum and cortex. Functional proof of concept was shown in transgenic 
      R6/2 HD mice. Eight weeks after AAV5-miHTT treatment, a significant improvement 
      in motor coordination on the rotarod was observed. Survival analysis showed that 
      a single AAV5-miHTT treatment resulted in a significant 4-week increase in median 
      survival compared with vehicle-treated R6/2 HD mice. The combination of long-term 
      HTT lowering, reduction in aggregation, prevention of neuronal dysfunction, 
      alleviation of HD-like symptoms, and beneficial survival observed in HD rodents 
      treated with AAV5-miHTT supports the continued development of HTT-lowering gene 
      therapies for HD.

TI  - Modulation of mTOR and CREB pathways following mGluR5 blockade contribute to 
      improved Huntington's pathology in zQ175 mice.

LID - 35
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a genetic 
      abnormality in the huntingtin gene that leads to a polyglutamine repeat expansion 
      of the huntingtin protein. The cleaved polyglutamine expansion of mutant 
      huntingtin (mHTT) protein can form aggregates strongly correlated with HD 
      progression. We have previously shown that the inhibition of mGluR5 using CTEP, a 
      selective negative allosteric mGluR5 modulator, can delay disease progression and 
      reduce in mHTT aggregates in the zQ175 mouse model of HD. This was paralleled by 
      enhanced catalytic activity of Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), a kinase modulated by 
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and key regulator of autophagy initiation. 
      In the present study, we show that CTEP can correct aberrant phosphoinositide 
      3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR signaling detected in zQ175 mice that may underlie the 
      enhanced ULK1 activity and activation of autophagy. We also show that CTEP can 
      facilitate cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-mediated expression of 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to foster neuronal survival and reduce 
      apoptosis. Taken together, our findings provide the molecular evidence for how 
      targeting mGluR5 using a well-tolerated selective NAM can mitigate two critical 
      mechanisms of neurodegeneration, autophagy and apoptosis.

TI  - Clinical manifestations of homozygote allele carriers in Huntington disease.
PG  - e2101-e2108
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000007147 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Because patients homozygous for Huntington disease (HD) receive the 
      gain-of-function mutation in a double dose, one would expect a more toxic effect 
      in homozygotes than in heterozygotes. Our aim was to investigate the phenotypic 
      differences between homozygotes with both alleles >/=36 CAG repeats and 
      heterozygotes with 1 allele >/=36 CAG repeats. METHODS: This was an international, 
      longitudinal, case-control study (European Huntington's Disease Network Registry 
      database). Baseline and longitudinal total functional capacity, motor, cognitive, 
      and behavioral scores of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) 
      were compared between homozygotes and heterozygotes. Four-year follow-up data 
      were analyzed using longitudinal mixed-effects models. To estimate the 
      association of age at onset with the length of the shorter and larger allele in 
      homozygotes and heterozygotes, regression analysis was applied. RESULTS: Of 
      10,921 participants with HD (5,777 female [52.9%] and 5,138 male [47.0%]) with a 
      mean age of 55.1 +/- 14.1 years, 28 homozygotes (0.3%) and 10,893 (99.7%) 
      heterozygotes were identified. After correcting for multiple comparisons, 
      homozygotes and heterozygotes had similar age at onset and UHDRS scores and 
      disease progression. In the multivariate linear regression analysis, the longer 
      allele was the most contributing factor to decreased age at HD onset in the 
      homozygotes (p < 0.0001) and heterozygotes (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: CAG repeat 
      expansion on both alleles of the HTT gene is infrequent. Age at onset, HD 
      phenotype, and disease progression do not significantly differ between 
      homozygotes and heterozygotes, indicating similar effect on the mutant protein. 
      CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that age at 
      onset, the motor phenotype and rate of motor decline, and symptoms and signs 
      progression is similar in homozygotes compared to heterozygotes.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the most common autosomal dominant muscular dystrophy 
      and encompasses both skeletal muscle and cardiac complications. DM is nucleotide 
      repeat expansion disorder in which type 1 (DM1) is due to a trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion on chromosome 19 and type 2 (DM2) arises from a tetranucleotide repeat 
      expansion on chromosome 3. Developing representative models of DM in animals has 
      been challenging due to instability of nucleotide repeat expansions, especially 
      for DM2, which is characterized by nucleotide repeat expansions often greater 
      than 5,000 copies. To investigate mechanisms of human DM, we generated cellular 
      models of DM1 and DM2. We used regulated MyoD expression to reprogram 
      urine-derived cells into myotubes. In this myogenic cell model, we found impaired 
      dystrophin expression, in the presence of muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) foci, and 
      aberrant splicing in DM1 but not in DM2 cells. We generated induced pluripotent 
      stem cells (iPSC) from healthy controls and DM1 and DM2 subjects, and we 
      differentiated these into cardiomyocytes. DM1 and DM2 cells displayed an increase 
      in RNA foci concomitant with cellular differentiation. iPSC-derived 
      cardiomyocytes from DM1 but not DM2 had aberrant splicing of known target genes 
      and MBNL sequestration. High-resolution imaging revealed tight association 
      between MBNL clusters and RNA foci in DM1. Ca2+ transients differed between DM1- 
      and DM2 iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, and each differed from healthy control 
      cells. RNA-sequencing from DM1- and DM2 iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes revealed 
      distinct misregulation of gene expression, as well as differential aberrant 
      splicing patterns. Together, these data support that DM1 and DM2, despite some 
      shared clinical and molecular features, have distinct pathological signatures.

TI  - Enhanced striatopallidal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor transmission 
      in mouse models of huntington's disease.
PG  - 684-696
LID - 10.1002/mds.27622 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the 
      huntingtin gene. This mutation leads to progressive dysfunction that is largely 
      attributable to dysfunction of the striatum. The earliest signs of striatal 
      pathology in HD are found in indirect pathway gamma-Aminobutyric acid 
      (GABA)-ergic spiny projection neurons that innervate the external segment of the 
      globus pallidus (GPe). What is less clear is whether the synaptic coupling of 
      spiny projection neurons with GPe neurons changes in HD. OBJECTIVES: The 
      principal goal of this study was to determine whether striatopallidal synaptic 
      transmission was altered in 2 mouse models of HD. METHODS: Striatopallidal 
      synaptic transmission was studied using electrophysiological and optogenetic 
      approaches in ex vivo brain slices from 2 HD models: Q175 heterozygous (het) and 
      R6/2 mice. RESULTS: Striatopallidal synaptic transmission increased in strength 
      with the progression of behavioral deficits in Q175 and R6/2 mice. The alteration 
      in synaptic transmission was evident in both prototypical and arkypallidal GPe 
      neurons. This change did not appear attributable to an increase in the 
      probability of GABA release but, rather, to an enhancement in the postsynaptic 
      response to GABA released at synaptic sites. This alteration significantly 
      increased the ability of striatopallidal axon terminals to pause ongoing GPe 
      activity. CONCLUSIONS: In 2 mouse models of HD, striatopallidal synaptic 
      transmission increased in parallel with the progression of behavioral deficits. 
      This adaptation could compensate in part for the concomitant deficit in the 
      ability of corticostriatal signals to activate spiny projection neurons and pause 
      GPe activity. (c) 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

AB  - Antagonist pleiotropy, where a gene exerts a beneficial effect at early stages 
      and a deleterious effect later on in an animal's life, may explain the 
      evolutionary persistence of devastating genetic diseases such as Huntington's 
      disease (HD). To date, however, there is little direct experimental evidence to 
      support this theory. Here, we studied a transgenic mouse carrying the HD mutation 
      with a repeat of 50 CAGs (R6/2_50) that is within the pathological range of 
      repeats causing adult-onset disease in humans. R6/2_50 mice develop 
      characteristic HD brain aggregate pathology, with aggregates appearing 
      predominantly in the striatum and cortex. However, they show few signs of disease 
      in their lifetime. On the contrary, R6/2_50 mice appear to benefit from carrying 
      the mutation. They have extended lifespans compared to wildtype (WT) mice, and 
      male mice show enhanced fecundity. Furthermore, R6/2_50 mice outperform WT mice 
      on the rotarod and show equal or better performance in the two choice 
      discrimination task than WT mice. This novel mouse line provides direct 
      experimental evidence that, although the HD mutation causes a fatal 
      neurodegenerative disorder, there may be premorbid benefits of carrying the 
      mutation.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene and 
      is characterized by early and selective striatal neurodegeneration. The 
      huntingtin (HTT) protein is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and the 
      cellular pathogenesis of the disease is not fully understood. Immune cell 
      dysfunction due to mutant HTT (mHTT) expression and aberrant immune system 
      activation in HD patients suggests that inflammatory processes may contribute to 
      HD pathogenesis. Here we used the BACHD mouse model of HD, which carries a 
      conditional transgene expressing full-length human mHTT, to selectively deplete 
      mHTT expression in myeloid lineage cells, including microglia, and evaluated the 
      effects on HD-related behavior and neuropathology. In the converse experiment, we 
      depleted mHTT expression in the majority of cells in the brain but specifically 
      excluding microglia and again evaluated behavior and neuropathology. In mice with 
      myeloid-specific mHTT-depletion, we observed no significant rescue of any 
      behavioral or neuropathological outcome measures, while neural-specific knockout 
      mice showed significant rescue of body weight, rotarod performance and striatal 
      volume. We conclude that mHTT expression in microglia, though clearly affecting 
      specific aspects of microglia function, does not alter disease pathogenesis in 
      the BACHD mouse model. This may have implications for current or future 
      therapeutic trials testing immune-modulating drugs in HD patients.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a tandem 
      repeat mutation encoding an expanded polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin 
      protein, which leads to cognitive, psychiatric and motor dysfunction. Exposure to 
      environmental enrichment (EE), which enhances levels of cognitive stimulation and 
      physical activity, has therapeutic effects on cognitive, affective and motor 
      function of transgenic HD mice. The present study investigated gene expression 
      changes and behavioral pharmacology in male and female R6/1 transgenic HD mice at 
      an early time-point in HD progression associated with onset of cognitive and 
      affective abnormalities, following EE and exercise (wheel running) interventions. 
      We have demonstrated changes in expression levels of the serotonin (5-HT) 
      receptor Htr1a, Htr1b, Htr2a and Htr2c genes (encoding the 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), 
      5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors, respectively) in HD brains at 8 weeks of age, 
      using quantitative real-time PCR. In contrast, expression of the serotonin 
      transporter (SerT, also known as 5-HTT or Slc6a4) was not altered in these 
      brains. Furthermore, we identified region-specific, sex-specific and 
      environmentally regulated (comparing EE, exercise and standard housing 
      conditions) impacts on gene expression of particular 5-HT receptors, as well as 
      SerT. For example, SerT gene expression was upregulated by exercise (wheel 
      running from 6 to 8 weeks of age) in the hippocampus. Interestingly, when EE was 
      introduced from 6 to 8 weeks of age, Htr2a gene expression was upregulated in the 
      cortex, striatum and hippocampus of male mice. EE also rescued the functional 
      activity of 5-HT(2) receptors as observed in the head-twitch test, reflecting 
      sexually dimorphic effects of environmental stimulation. These findings 
      demonstrate that disruption of the serotonergic system occurs early in HD 
      pathogenesis and, together with previous findings, show that the timing and 
      duration of environmental interventions are critical in terms of their ability to 
      modify gene expression. This study is the first to show that EE is able to 
      selectively enhance both gene expression of a neurotransmitter receptor and the 
      functional consequences on behavioral pharmacology, and links this molecular 
      modulation to the therapeutic effects of environmental stimulation in this 
      neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Baratela-Scott syndrome (BSS) is a rare, autosomal-recessive disorder 
      characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphisms, developmental delay, and 
      skeletal dysplasia caused by pathogenic variants in XYLT1. We report clinical and 
      molecular investigation of 10 families (12 individuals) with BSS. Standard 
      sequencing methods identified biallelic pathogenic variants in XYLT1 in only two 
      families. Of the remaining cohort, two probands had no variants and six probands 
      had only a single variant, including four with a heterozygous 3.1 Mb 16p13 
      deletion encompassing XYLT1 and two with a heterozygous truncating variant. 
      Bisulfite sequencing revealed aberrant hypermethylation in exon 1 of XYLT1, 
      always in trans with the sequence variant or deletion when present; both alleles 
      were methylated in those with no identified variant. Expression of the methylated 
      XYLT1 allele was severely reduced in fibroblasts from two probands. Southern blot 
      studies combined with repeat expansion analysis of genome sequence data showed 
      that the hypermethylation is associated with expansion of a GGC repeat in the 
      XYLT1 promoter region that is not present in the reference genome, confirming 
      that BSS is a trinucleotide repeat expansion disorder. The hypermethylated allele 
      accounts for 50% of disease alleles in our cohort and is not present in 130 
      control subjects. Our study highlights the importance of investigating 
      non-sequence-based alterations, including epigenetic changes, to identify the 
      missing heritability in genetic disorders.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal hereditary neurodegenerative disorder, best 
      known for its clinical triad of progressive motor impairment, cognitive deficits 
      and psychiatric disturbances, is caused by CAG-repeat expansion in exon 1 of 
      Huntingtin (HTT). However, in addition to the neurological disease, mutant HTT 
      (mHTT), which is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, impairs other organ 
      systems. Not surprisingly, cardiovascular dysautonomia as well as the 
      deterioration of circadian rhythms are among the earliest detectable 
      pathophysiological changes in individuals with HD. Mitochondrial dysfunction in 
      the brain and skeletal muscle in HD has been well documented, as the disease 
      progresses. However, not much is known about mitochondrial abnormalities in the 
      heart. In this study, we describe a role for Drp1/Fis1-mediated excessive 
      mitochondrial fission and dysfunction, associated with lysosomal dysfunction in 
      H9C2 expressing long polyglutamine repeat (Q73) and in human iPSC-derived 
      cardiomyocytes transfected with Q77. Expression of long polyglutamine repeat led 
      to reduced ATP production and mitochondrial fragmentation. We observed an 
      increased accumulation of damaged mitochondria in the lysosome that was coupled 
      with lysosomal dysfunction. Importantly, reducing Drp1/Fis1-mediated 
      mitochondrial damage significantly improved mitochondrial function and cell 
      survival. Finally, reducing Fis1-mediated Drp1 recruitment to the mitochondria, 
      using the selective inhibitor of this interaction, P110, improved mitochondrial 
      structure in the cardiac tissue of R6/2 mice. We suggest that drugs focusing on 
      the central nervous system will not address mitochondrial function across all 
      organs, and therefore will not be a sufficient strategy to treat or slow down HD 
      disease progression.

PG  - 412-422
LID - 10.1080/15374416.2018.1514613 [doi]
AB  - Although temperament has been studied for decades as a predictor of 
      psychopathology in the general population, examining temperament in neurogenetic 
      groups has unique potential to inform the genetic and biological factors that may 
      confer risk for psychopathology in later development. The present study examined 
      early temperament in two heritable neurogenetic conditions associated with 
      atypical CGG repeat expansions on the FMR1 gene: the FMR1 premutation (FXpm; 
      55-200 repeats) and fragile X syndrome (FXS; > 200 repeats). We focus 
      specifically on the FXpm, as the condition is highly prevalent (1:209-291 female 
      individuals, 1:430-855 male individuals) and has been preliminarily associated 
      with increased risk for pediatric psychopathology, including attention problems, 
      autism, and anxiety. In contrast, FXS is a low-incidence disorder (1:7,143 males, 
      1:11,111 females) often associated with intellectual disability and severe 
      co-occurring psychosocial conditions, particularly in male individuals. Given 
      information on infant clinical phenotypes in the FXpm and FXS is sparse, we aimed 
      to characterize parent-reported infant temperament in infants with the FXpm 
      (n = 22) relative to FXS (n = 24) and controls (n = 24) assessed on 1 to 3 
      occasions each. Temperament in infants with the FXpm largely fell between TD and 
      FXS groups, with trends toward suppressed negative affect in younger 
      participants, similar to lower negative affect previously reported in FXS. The 
      FXS group consistently demonstrated lower negative affect and surgency than TD 
      controls. These data suggest that FMR1 gene mutations are associated with 
      atypical temperament that emerges as early as infancy, particularly among infants 
      with FXS, warranting further study of whether temperament may index emergent 
      clinical risks in these populations.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by an expanded CAG repeat. Though symptom onset commonly occurs at midlife 
      and inversely correlates with the CAG repeat expansion, age at clinical onset and 
      progression rate are variable. In the present study we investigated the 
      relationship between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and HD development. LTL was 
      measured by real-time PCR in manifest HD patients (HD, n...=...62), pre-manifest HD 
      patients (pre-HD, n...=...38), and age-matched controls (n...=...76). Significant LTL 
      differences were observed between the three groups (p...<....0001), with LTL values 
      in the order: HD...<...pre-HD...<...controls. The relationship between LTL and age was 
      different in the three groups. An inverse relationship between mean LTL and CAG 
      repeat number was found in the pre-HD (p...=....03). The overall data seem to 
      indicate that after age 30...years, LT begins to shorten markedly in pre-HD 
      patients according to CAG number and increasing age, up to the values observed in 
      HD. This very suggestive picture allowed us to hypothesize that in pre-manifest 
      HD, LTL could be a measure of time to clinical HD onset. The possible use of LTL 
      as a reliable biomarker to track HD development and progression was evaluated and 
      discussed.

TI  - Regional subcortical shape analysis in premanifest Huntington's disease.
PG  - 1419-1433
LID - 10.1002/hbm.24456 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) involves preferential and progressive degeneration of 
      striatum and other subcortical regions as well as regional cortical atrophy. It 
      is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin gene, and the longer the 
      expansion the earlier the age of onset. Atrophy begins prior to manifest clinical 
      signs and symptoms, and brain atrophy in premanifest expansion carriers can be 
      studied. We employed a diffeomorphometric pipeline to contrast subcortical 
      structures' morphological properties in a control group with three disease groups 
      representing different phases of premanifest HD (far, intermediate, and near to 
      onset) as defined by the length of the CAG expansion and the participant's age 
      (CAG-Age-Product). A total of 1,428 magnetic resonance image scans from 694 
      participants from the PREDICT-HD cohort were used. We found significant 
      region-specific atrophies in all subcortical structures studied, with the 
      estimated abnormality onset time varying from structure to structure. 
      Heterogeneous shape abnormalities of caudate nuclei were present in premanifest 
      HD participants estimated furthest from onset and putaminal shape abnormalities 
      were present in participants intermediate to onset. Thalamic, hippocampal, and 
      amygdalar shape abnormalities were present in participants nearest to onset. We 
      assessed whether the estimated progression of subcortical pathology in 
      premanifest HD tracked specific pathways. This is plausible for changes in basal 
      ganglia circuits but probably not for changes in hippocampus and amygdala. The 
      regional shape analyses conducted in this study provide useful insights into the 
      effects of HD pathology in subcortical structures.

TI  - FAN1 modifies Huntington's disease progression by stabilizing the expanded HTT 
      CAG repeat.
PG  - 650-661
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddy375 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by an 
      expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. CAG repeat length explains 
      around half of the variation in age at onset (AAO) but genetic variation 
      elsewhere in the genome accounts for a significant proportion of the remainder. 
      Genome-wide association studies have identified a bidirectional signal on 
      chromosome 15, likely underlain by FANCD2- and FANCI-associated nuclease 1 
      (FAN1), a nuclease involved in DNA interstrand cross link repair. Here we show 
      that increased FAN1 expression is significantly associated with delayed AAO and 
      slower progression of HD, suggesting FAN1 is protective in the context of an 
      expanded HTT CAG repeat. FAN1 overexpression in human cells reduces CAG repeat 
      expansion in exogenously expressed mutant HTT exon 1, and in patient-derived stem 
      cells and differentiated medium spiny neurons, FAN1 knockdown increases CAG 
      repeat expansion. The stabilizing effects are FAN1 concentration and CAG repeat 
      length-dependent. We show that FAN1 binds to the expanded HTT CAG repeat DNA and 
      its nuclease activity is not required for protection against CAG repeat 
      expansion. These data shed new mechanistic insights into how the genetic 
      modifiers of HD act to alter disease progression and show that FAN1 affects 
      somatic expansion of the CAG repeat through a nuclease-independent mechanism. 
      This provides new avenues for therapeutic interventions in HD and potentially 
      other triplet repeat disorders.

TI  - C9orf72 Repeat Expansion Frequency among Patients with Huntington Disease Genetic 
      Testing.
PG  - 239-253
LID - 10.1159/000492499 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: European studies identified the C9orf72 repeat expansion as the most 
      frequent genetic alteration in patients with Huntington disease (HD)-like 
      phenotypes but negative HD genetic testing. OBJECTIVE: To investigate C9orf72 
      repeat expansion frequency in individuals tested for HD in a North American 
      tertiary referral laboratory. METHODS: Three hundred and seventy-three cases (115 
      positive and 258 negative for HD) were evaluated by genotyping PCR, with 
      follow-up Southern blot and 5' repeat methylation status assessment by combined 
      repeat-primed and methylation-specific PCR in a subset. RESULTS: Three cases (all 
      HD-negative) tested positive: 2 had > 2,000 repeats and were methylated, 1 had 
      80-100 repeats and was unmethylated. Two cases (1 HD-positive and 1 HD-negative) 
      had intermediate alleles (20-29 repeats) and were unmethylated. The remaining 368 
      cases were negative (< 20 repeats). C9orf72 repeat expansion was absent in 
      patients with HD and was identified in a small subset (1.2%) of patients with 
      negative HD genetic testing. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that C9orf72 
      repeat expansion does not coexist with HTT repeat expansion and that C9orf72 
      repeat expansion testing is unnecessary for patients with HD. In addition, 
      C9orf72 evaluation may be considered for individuals negative for HD genetic 
      testing. Similar to in previous studies, methylation of C9orf72 repeat expansion 
      was limited to large expansions.

TI  - Genetic mutations in Ca(2+) signaling alter dendrite morphology and social 
      approach in juvenile mice.
PG  - e12526
LID - 10.1111/gbb.12526 [doi]
AB  - Dendritic morphology is a critical determinant of neuronal connectivity, and 
      calcium signaling plays a predominant role in shaping dendrites. Altered 
      dendritic morphology and genetic mutations in calcium signaling are both 
      associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). In this study we tested the 
      hypothesis that dendritic arborization and NDD-relevant behavioral phenotypes are 
      altered by human mutations that modulate calcium-dependent signaling pathways 
      implicated in NDDs. The dendritic morphology of pyramidal neurons in CA1 
      hippocampus and somatosensory cortex was quantified in Golgi-stained brain 
      sections from juvenile mice of both sexes expressing either a human 
      gain-of-function mutation in ryanodine receptor 1 (T4826I-RYR1), a human CGG 
      repeat expansion (170-200 CGG repeats) in the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 
      (FMR1 premutation), both mutations (double mutation; DM), or wildtype mice. In 
      hippocampal neurons, increased dendritic arborization was observed in male 
      T4826I-RYR1 and, to a lesser extent, male FMR1 premutation neurons. Dendritic 
      morphology of cortical neurons was altered in both sexes of FMR1 premutation and 
      DM animals with the most pronounced differences seen in DM females. Genotype also 
      impaired behavior, as assessed using the three-chambered social approach test. 
      The most striking lack of sociability was observed in DM male and female mice. In 
      conclusion, mutations that alter the fidelity of calcium signaling enhance 
      dendritic arborization in a brain region- and sex-specific manner and impair 
      social behavior in juvenile mice. The phenotypic outcomes of these mutations 
      likely provide a susceptible biological substrate for additional environmental 
      stressors that converge on calcium signaling to determine individual NDD risk.

AB  - Huntington's disease is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the HTT 
      gene. We have previously shown that exon 1 HTT does not always splice to exon 2 
      producing a small transcript (HTTexon1) that encodes the highly pathogenic exon 1 
      HTT protein. The mechanisms by which this incomplete splicing occurs are unknown. 
      Here, we have generated a minigene system that recapitulates the CAG 
      repeat-length dependence of HTTexon1 production, and has allowed us to define the 
      regions of intron 1 necessary for incomplete splicing. We show that manipulation 
      of the expression levels of the splicing factor SRSF6, predicted to bind CAG 
      repeats, modulates this aberrant splicing event and also demonstrate that RNA 
      polymerase II transcription speed regulates the levels of HTTexon1 production. 
      Understanding the mechanisms by which this pathogenic exon 1 HTT is generated may 
      provide the basis for the development of strategies to prevent its production.

AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat diseases are a class of neurodegenerative disorders 
      caused by CAG-repeat expansion. There are diverse cellular mechanisms behind the 
      pathogenesis of polyQ disorders, including transcriptional dysregulation. 
      Interestingly, we find that levels of the long isoform of nuclear paraspeckle 
      assembly transcript 1 (Neat1L) are elevated in the brains of mouse models of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 7 and Huntington's disease (HD). Neat1L was 
      also elevated in differentiated striatal neurons derived from HD knock-in mice 
      and in HD patient brains. The elevation was mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) dependent, 
      as knockdown of mHTT in vitro and in vivo restored Neat1L to normal levels. In 
      additional studies, we found that Neat1L is repressed by methyl CpG binding 
      protein 2 (MeCP2) by RNA-protein interaction but not by occupancy of MeCP2 at its 
      promoter. We also found that NEAT1L overexpression protects from mHTT-induced 
      cytotoxicity, while reducing it enhanced mHTT-dependent toxicity. Gene set 
      enrichment analysis of previously published RNA sequencing data from mouse 
      embryonic fibroblasts and cells derived from HD patients shows that loss of 
      NEAT1L impairs multiple cellular functions, including pathways involved in cell 
      proliferation and development. Intriguingly, the genes dysregulated in HD human 
      brain samples overlap with pathways affected by a reduction in NEAT1, confirming 
      the correlation of NEAT1L and HD-induced perturbations. Cumulatively, the role of 
      NEAT1L in polyQ disease model systems and human tissues suggests that it may play 
      a protective role in CAG-repeat expansion diseases.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which is expressed 
      ubiquitously throughout the brain and peripheral tissues. Whilst the focus of 
      much research has been on the cognitive, psychiatric and motor symptoms of HD, 
      the extent of peripheral pathology and its potential impact on central symptoms 
      has been less intensely explored. Disruption of the gastrointestinal microbiome 
      (gut dysbiosis) has been recently reported in a number of neurological and 
      psychiatric disorders, and therefore we hypothesized that it might also occur in 
      HD. We have used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize the gut microbiome 
      in the R6/1 transgenic mouse model of HD, relative to littermate wild-type 
      controls. We report that there is a significant difference in microbiota 
      composition in HD mice at 12...weeks of age. Specifically, we observed an increase 
      in Bacteriodetes and a proportional decrease in Firmicutes in the HD gut 
      microbiome. In addition, we observed an increase in microbial diversity in male 
      HD mice, compared to wild-type controls, but no differences in diversity were 
      observed in female HD mice. The gut dysbiosis observed coincided with impairment 
      in body weight gain despite higher food intake as well as motor deficits at 
      12...weeks of age. Gut dysbiosis was also associated with a change in the gut 
      microenvironment, as we observed higher fecal water content in HD mice at 
      12...weeks of age. This study provides the first evidence of gut dysbiosis in HD.

AB  - Huntington's disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder resulting from a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the first exon of the gene encoding the Huntingtin protein 
      (Htt). Phosphorylation of this protein region (Httex1) has been shown to play 
      important roles in regulating the structure, toxicity, and cellular properties of 
      N-terminal fragments and full-length Htt. However, increasing evidence suggests 
      that phosphomimetic substitutions in Htt result in inconsistent findings and do 
      not reproduce all aspects of true phosphorylation. Here, we investigated the 
      effects of bona fide phosphorylation at Ser-13 or Ser-16 on the structure, 
      aggregation, membrane binding, and subcellular properties of the Httex1-Q18A 
      variant and compared these effects with those of phosphomimetic substitutions. We 
      show that phosphorylation at either Ser-13 and/or Ser-16 or phosphomimetic 
      substitutions at both these residues inhibit the aggregation of mutant Httex1, 
      but that only phosphorylation strongly disrupts the amphipathic alpha-helix of the N 
      terminus and prompts the internalization and nuclear targeting of preformed 
      Httex1 aggregates. In synthetic peptides, phosphorylation at Ser-13, Ser-16, or 
      both residues strongly disrupted the amphipathic alpha-helix of the N-terminal 17 
      residues (Nt17) of Httex1 and Nt17 membrane binding. Experiments with peptides 
      bearing different combinations of phosphorylation sites within Nt17 revealed a 
      phosphorylation-dependent switch that regulates the Httex1 structure, involving 
      cross-talk between phosphorylation at Thr-3 and Ser-13 or Ser-16. Our results 
      provide crucial insights into the role of phosphorylation in regulating Httex1 
      structure and function, and underscore the critical importance of identifying the 
      enzymes responsible for regulating Htt phosphorylation, and their potential as 
      therapeutic targets for managing Huntington's disease.

TI  - GLP-1 Analogue Liraglutide Attenuates Mutant Huntingtin-Induced Neurotoxicity by 
      Restoration of Neuronal Insulin Signaling.
LID - 10.3390/ijms19092505 [doi]
LID - 2505
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of huntingtin (HTT) protein. 
      The accumulation of mutant HTT (mHTT) contributes to neurotoxicity by causing 
      autophagy defects and oxidative stress that ultimately lead to neuronal death. 
      Interestingly, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of 
      type-2 diabetes, a metabolic disease mainly caused by defective insulin 
      signaling, is higher in patients with HD than in healthy controls. Although the 
      precise mechanisms of mHTT-mediated toxicity remain unclear, the blockade of 
      brain insulin signaling may initiate or exacerbate mHTT-induced 
      neurodegeneration. In this study, we used an in vitro HD model to investigate 
      whether neuronal insulin signaling is involved in mHTT-mediated neurotoxicity. 
      Our results demonstrated that mHTT overexpression significantly impairs insulin 
      signaling and causes apoptosis in neuronal cells. However, treatment with 
      liraglutide, a GLP-1 analogue, markedly restores insulin sensitivity and enhances 
      cell viability. This neuroprotective effect may be attributed to the contribution 
      of the upregulated expression of genes associated with endogenous antioxidant 
      pathways to oxidative stress reduction. In addition, liraglutide stimulates 
      autophagy through AMPK activation, which attenuates the accumulation of HTT 
      aggregates within neuronal cells. Our findings collectively suggest that 
      liraglutide can rescue impaired insulin signaling caused by mHTT and that GLP-1 
      may potentially reduce mHTT-induced neurotoxicity in the pathogenesis of HD.

AB  - Prodynorphin (PDYN) binds to k-opioid receptors (KOPr; encoded by OPRK1) and is 
      known to regulate dopaminergic tone, making this system important for drugs 
      addiction. Dynorphin (Dyn)/KORr system are powerful effectors of stress-induced 
      alterations in reward processing and dysphoric states. Thus, We identified 11 
      potential functional SNPs and one variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) in this 
      system, performed a case-control association analysis, investigated particular 
      disease phenotypes, assessed the joint effect of variants in two genes, carried 
      out a meta-analysis to analyze the association between this VNTR and Heroin 
      dependence (HD) risk. Eleven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were 
      genotyped using SNaPshot SNP technology. Participants included 566 healthy 
      controls and 541 patients with HD. We found that PDYN polymorphisms modulate the 
      susceptibility to HD. An increased risk of HD was significantly associated with H 
      alleles of PDYN VNTR (chi(2) = 10.824, p = 0.001, OR = 1.419, 95% CI = 
      1.151-1.748). In addition, the results revealed the patients with the HH genotype 
      showed greater number of withdrawal instances (F(2538) = 7.987, p = 0.0004) 
      compared to the patients with the LL genotype. The Meta-analysis showed the 
      pooled effect of the H allele at this locus is a risk factor for HD in Chinese 
      Han. Gene-gene interaction analysis indicated strong interactions between PDYN 
      rs3830064, 68-bp VNTR and OPRK1 rs16918842, rs3802279. These findings support the 
      important role of PDYN polymorphism in HD, and may guide future studies to 
      identify genetic risk factors for HD.

TI  - Associations of serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphisms and monoamine 
      oxidase A gene polymorphisms with oppositional defiant disorder in a Chinese Han 
      population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is a behavioral disorder that 
      mainly refers to a recurrent pattern of disobedient, defiant, negativistic and 
      hostile behaviors toward authority figures. Previous studies have showed 
      associations of serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) with 
      behavioral and psychiatric disorders. The purposes of this study were to 
      investigate the potential association of 5-HTT gene promoter polymorphism 
      (5-HTTLPR) and MAOA gene polymorphism with susceptibility to ODD in a Han Chinese 
      school population. METHODS: The 5-HTTLPR gene polymorphism and the MAOA gene 
      polymorphism were genotyped in a case-control study of 257 Han Chinese children 
      (123 ODD and 134 healthy controls). RESULTS: There was significant difference in 
      the allele distribution of 5-HTTLPR (chi(2) = 7.849, P = 0.005) between the ODD and 
      control groups. Further, there were significant differences in genotype 
      (chi(2) = 5.168, P = 0.023) and allele distributions (chi(2) = 10.336, P = 0.001) of 
      the MAOA gene polymorphism that is variable-number tandem repeat (MAOA-uVNTR) 
      between two groups. Moreover, there were significant differences in genotype 
      (chi(2) = 4.624, P = 0.032) and allele distributions (chi(2) = 9.248, P = 0.002) of 
      MAOA-uVNTR only in the male ODD and healthy groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      suggest that 5-HTTLPR and MAOA-uVNTR gene variants may contribute to 
      susceptibility to ODD. Further, MAOA-uVNTR gene polymorphism may play a role in 
      susceptibility to ODD only in male children.

AB  - Age at onset of Huntington disease, an inherited neurodegenerative disorder, is 
      influenced by the size of the disease-causing CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      in HTT and by genetic modifier loci on chromosomes 8 and 15. Stratifying by 
      modifier genotype, we have examined putamen volume, total motor score (TMS), and 
      symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) scores, both at study entry and 
      longitudinally, in normal controls and CAG-expansion carriers who were enrolled 
      prior to the emergence of manifest HD in the PREDICT-HD study. The modifiers, 
      which included onset-hastening and onset-delaying alleles on chromosome 15 and an 
      onset-hastening allele on chromosome 8, revealed no major effect in controls but 
      distinct patterns of modification in prediagnosis HD subjects. Putamen volume at 
      study entry showed evidence of reciprocal modification by the chromosome 15 
      alleles, but the rate of loss of putamen volume was modified only by the 
      deleterious chromosome 15 allele. By contrast, both alleles modified the rate of 
      change of the SDMT score, but neither had an effect on the TMS. The influence of 
      the chromosome 8 modifier was evident only in the rate of TMS increase. The data 
      indicate that (1) modification of pathogenesis can occur early in the 
      prediagnosis phase, (2) the modifier loci act in genetic interaction with the HD 
      mutation rather than through independent additive effects, and (3) HD subclinical 
      phenotypes are differentially influenced by each modifier, implying distinct 
      effects in different cells or tissues. Together, these findings indicate the 
      potential benefit of using genetic modifier strategies for dissecting the 
      prediagnosis pathogenic process in HD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease is a late onset neurological disorder caused by 
      a trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion mutation in the HTT gene encoding for the 
      protein huntingtin. Despite considerable ongoing research, the wild-type function 
      of huntingtin is not yet fully understood. OBJECTIVE: To improve knowledge of HTT 
      gene regulation at the transcriptional level and inform future studies aimed at 
      uncovering the HTT gene's normal function. METHODS: The HTT gene region was 
      functionally characterized through an in silico analysis using publicly available 
      data sets. ChIP-seq data sets and the online STRING database were used to 
      identify putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and protein-protein 
      interactions within the HTT promoter region. siRNA-mediated knockdown and 
      ChIP-qPCR of STAT1, a TF identified from the in silico analysis, were used to 
      validate the bioinformatics screen. RESULTS: 16 regions containing potential 
      regulatory genomic markers were identified. TFBSs for 59 transcription factors 
      (TFs) were detected in one or more of the 16 candidate regions. Using these TFs, 
      15 clusters of protein-protein interactions were identified using STRING. 
      siRNA-mediated knockdown of STAT1 resulted in an increase in HTT expression, and 
      ChIP-qPCR detected enrichment of STAT1 binding at one of the predicted regions. 
      These assays confirmed the utility of the bioinformatic analysis. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Putative regulatory regions outside of the immediate HTT promoter region have 
      been identified with specific protein-protein interactions. Future work will 
      focus on in vitro and in vivo studies to examine the effect of modulating 
      identified TFBSs and altering the levels of specific TFs of interest in 
      regulating HTT gene expression.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Previously, we showed 
      strong huntingtin reduction and prevention of neuronal dysfunction in HD rodents 
      using an engineered microRNA targeting human huntingtin, delivered via 
      adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 5 vector with a transgene encoding an 
      engineered miRNA against HTT mRNA (AAV5-miHTT). One of the challenges of rodents 
      as a model of neurodegenerative diseases is their relatively small brain, making 
      successful translation to the HD patient difficult. This is particularly relevant 
      for gene therapy approaches, where distribution achieved upon local 
      administration into the parenchyma is likely dependent on brain size and 
      structure. Here, we aimed to demonstrate the translation of huntingtin-lowering 
      gene therapy to a large-animal brain. We investigated the feasibility, efficacy, 
      and tolerability of one-time intracranial administration of AAV5-miHTT in the 
      transgenic HD (tgHD) minipig model. We detected widespread dose-dependent 
      distribution of AAV5-miHTT throughout the tgHD minipig brain that correlated with 
      the engineered microRNA expression. Both human mutant huntingtin mRNA and protein 
      were significantly reduced in all brain regions transduced by AAV5-miHTT. The 
      combination of widespread vector distribution and extensive huntingtin lowering 
      observed with AAV5-miHTT supports the translation of a huntingtin-lowering gene 
      therapy for HD from preclinical studies into the clinic.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a dominant, late-onset disease characterized by 
      choreiform movements, cognitive decline, and personality disturbance. It is 
      caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the Huntington's disease gene 
      encoding for the Huntingtin protein (Htt) which functions as a scaffold for 
      selective macroautophagy. Mutant Htt (mHtt) disrupts vesicle trafficking and 
      prevents autophagosome fusion with lysosomes, thus deregulating autophagy in 
      neuronal cells, leading to cell death. Autophagy has been described as a 
      therapeutic target for HD, owing to the key role Htt plays in the cellular 
      process. Rhodiola rosea, a plant extract used in traditional medicine in Europe 
      and Asia, has been shown to attenuate aging in the fly and other model species. 
      It has also been shown to inhibit the mTOR pathway and induce autophagy in 
      bladder cancer cell lines. We hypothesized that R. rosea, by inducing autophagy, 
      may improve the phenotype of a Huntington's disease model of the fly. Flies 
      expressing HttQ93 which exhibit decreased lifespan, impaired locomotion, and 
      increased neurodegeneration were supplemented with R. rosea extract, and assays 
      testing lifespan, locomotion, and pseudopupil degeneration provided quantitative 
      measures of improvement. Based on our observations, R. rosea may be further 
      evaluated as a potential therapy for Huntington's disease.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is one of the most common tandem repeat disorders and 
      presents as a unique trilogy of cognitive, psychiatric and motor symptoms. One of 
      the major mysteries of HD is why it selectively affects specific neuronal 
      populations. A new article in BMC Biology provides a piece in the puzzle of 
      pathogenesis. By demonstrating the delicate relationship between cortical and 
      striatal neurons, it provokes broader questions of how we might understand HD as 
      a disorder of synapses, neural circuits and systems biology.

AB  - Amplification of DNA is required as a mandatory step during library preparation 
      in most targeted sequencing protocols. This can be a critical limitation when 
      targeting regions that are highly repetitive or with extreme guanine-cytosine 
      (GC) content, including repeat expansions associated with human disease. Here, we 
      used an amplification-free protocol for targeted enrichment utilizing the 
      CRISPR/Cas9 system (No-Amp Targeted sequencing) in combination with single 
      molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing for studying repeat elements in the 
      huntingtin (HTT) gene, where an expanded CAG repeat is causative for Huntington 
      disease. We also developed a robust data analysis pipeline for repeat element 
      analysis that is independent of alignment of reads to a reference genome. The 
      method was applied to 11 diagnostic blood samples, and for all 22 alleles the 
      resulting CAG repeat count agreed with previous results based on fragment 
      analysis. The amplification-free protocol also allowed for studying somatic 
      variability of repeat elements in our samples, without the interference of PCR 
      stutter. In summary, with No-Amp Targeted sequencing in combination with our 
      analysis pipeline, we could accurately study repeat elements that are difficult 
      to investigate using PCR-based methods.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
      progressive movement disorders and cognitive deficits, which is caused by a 
      CAG-repeat expansion encoding an extended polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the 
      huntingtin protein (HTT). Reduction of mutant HTT levels and inhibition of 
      neuroinflammation has been proposed as a major therapeutic strategy in treating 
      HD. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy has been firmly established for the 
      treatment of several autoimmune or inflammatory neurological diseases, either as 
      adjunctive treatment or as first-line therapy. However, whether IVIg has 
      therapeutic potential on HD remains unclear. Here we for the first time 
      demonstrated that IVIg treatment remarkably rescued motor and cognitive deficits, 
      prevented synaptic degeneration, attenuated neuroinflammation and oxidative 
      stress in R6/2 mouse model. Further investigation showed that the beneficial 
      effects of IVIg resulted from the reduced levels of mutant HTT and inhibition of 
      NF-kappaB signalling pathway. These findings suggest that IVIg is a promising 
      therapeutic potential for HD.

TI  - Tissue-Specific Upregulation of Drosophila Insulin Receptor (InR) Mitigates 
      Poly(Q)-Mediated Neurotoxicity by Restoration of Cellular Transcription 
      Machinery.

AB  - Polyglutamine [poly(Q)] disorders are a class of trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      neurodegenerative disorders which are dominantly inherited and progressively 
      acquired with age. This group of disorders entail the characteristic formation of 
      protein aggregates leading to widespread loss of neurons in different regions of 
      the brain. SCA3 and HD, the two most commonly occurring types of poly(Q) 
      disorders were examined in the present study. With the aim of elucidating novel 
      genetic modifiers of poly(Q) disorders, the Drosophila insulin receptor (InR) was 
      identified as a potential suppressor of poly(Q)-induced neurotoxicity and 
      degeneration. We demonstrate for the first time that targeted upregulation of InR 
      could effectively mitigate poly(Q)-mediated neurodegeneration in fly models. A 
      significant reduction in poly(Q)-mediated cellular stress and apoptosis was noted 
      upon InR overexpression in poly(Q) background. We further reveal that targeted 
      upregulation of InR causes a substantial reduction in poly(Q) aggregate formation 
      with the residual inclusion bodies localised to the cytoplasm. We also 
      demonstrate that InR achieves suppression of poly(Q) toxicity by replenishing the 
      cellular pool of CREB binding protein and improving the histone acetylation 
      status of the cell. This leads to restoration of the cellular transcriptional 
      machinery which is otherwise severely compromised in poly(Q) disease conditions. 
      Interestingly, there also appeared a possibility of autophagy-mediated rescue of 
      poly(Q) phenotype due to upregulation of InR. Therefore, our study strongly 
      suggests that modulation of the insulin signalling pathway could be an effective 
      therapeutic intervention against poly(Q) disorders.

AB  - The CAG repeat expansion that elongates the polyglutamine tract in huntingtin is 
      the root genetic cause of Huntington's disease (HD), a debilitating 
      neurodegenerative disorder. This seemingly slight change to the primary amino 
      acid sequence alters the physical structure of the mutant protein and alters its 
      activity. We have identified a set of G-quadruplex-forming DNA aptamers (MS1, 
      MS2, MS3, MS4) that bind mutant huntingtin proximal to lysines K2932/K2934 in the 
      C-terminal CTD-II domain. Aptamer binding to mutant huntingtin abrogated the 
      enhanced polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) stimulatory activity conferred by 
      the expanded polyglutamine tract. In HD, but not normal, neuronal progenitor 
      cells (NPCs), MS3 aptamer co-localized with endogenous mutant huntingtin and was 
      associated with significantly decreased PRC2 activity. Furthermore, MS3 
      transfection protected HD NPCs against starvation-dependent stress with increased 
      ATP. Therefore, DNA aptamers can preferentially target mutant huntingtin and 
      modulate a gain of function endowed by the elongated polyglutamine segment. These 
      mutant huntingtin binding aptamers provide novel molecular tools for delineating 
      the effects of the HD mutation and encourage mutant huntingtin structure-based 
      approaches to therapeutic development.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The age of diagnosis of Huntington's disease (HD) varies among 
      individuals with the same HTT CAG-repeat expansion size. We investigated whether 
      early-life events, like perinatal insults or neurodevelopmental disorders, 
      influence the diagnosis age. METHODS: We used data from 13,856 participants from 
      REGISTRY and Enroll-HD, two large international multicenter observational 
      studies. Disease-free survival analyses of mutation carriers with an HTT CAG 
      repeat expansion size above and including 36 were computed through Kaplan-Meier 
      estimates of median time until an HD diagnosis. Comparisons between groups were 
      computed using a Cox proportional hazard survival model adjusted for CAG-repeat 
      expansion length. We also assessed whether the group effect depended on gender 
      and the affected parent. RESULTS: Insults in the perinatal period were associated 
      with an earlier median age of diagnosis of 45.00 years (95%CI: 42.07-47.92) 
      compared to 51.00 years (95%CI: 50.68-51.31) in the reference group, with a 
      CAG-adjusted hazard ratio of 1.61 (95%CI: 1.26-2.06). Neurodevelopmental 
      disorders were also associated with an earlier median age of diagnosis than the 
      reference group of 47.00 years (95% CI: 43.38-50.62) with a CAG-adjusted hazard 
      ratio of 1.42 (95%CI: 1.16-1.75). These associations did not change significantly 
      with gender or affected parent. CONCLUSIONS: These results, derived from large 
      observational datasets, show that perinatal insults and neurodevelopmental 
      disorders are associated with earlier ages of diagnosis of magnitudes similar to 
      the effects of known genetic modifiers of HD. Given their clear temporal 
      separation, these early events may be causative of earlier HD onset, but further 
      research is needed to prove causation.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, characterised 
      by a triad of movement disorder, emotional and behavioural disturbances and 
      cognitive impairment. The underlying cause is an expanded CAG repeat in the 
      huntingtin gene. For a small proportion of patients presenting with HD-like 
      symptoms, the mutation in this gene is not identified and they are said to have a 
      HD "phenocopy". South Africa has the highest number of recorded cases of an 
      African-specific phenocopy, Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2), caused by a repeat 
      expansion in the junctophilin-3 gene. However, a significant proportion of black 
      patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of HD still test negative for HD and 
      HDL2. This study thus aimed to investigate five other loci associated with HD 
      phenocopy syndromes - ATN1, ATXN2, ATXN7, TBP and C9orf72. In a sample of 
      patients in whom HD and HDL2 had been excluded, a single expansion was identified 
      in the ATXN2 gene, confirming a diagnosis of Spinocerebellar ataxia 2. The 
      results indicate that common repeat expansion disorders do not contribute 
      significantly to the HD-like phenotype in black South African patients. 
      Importantly, allele sizing reveals unique distributions of normal repeat lengths 
      across the associated loci in the African population studied.

TI  - Does arterial hypertension influence the onset of Huntington's disease?
PG  - e0197975
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0197975 [doi]
LID - e0197975
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) age of onset (AO) is mainly determined by the length of 
      the CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. The remaining AO variability has 
      been attributed to other little-known factors. A factor that has been associated 
      with other neurodegenerative diseases is arterial hypertension (AHT). The aim of 
      this study is to evaluate the contribution of AHT to the AO of HD. We used data 
      from a cohort of 630 European HD patients with adult onset collected by the 
      REGISTRY project of the European Huntington's Disease Network. Multiple linear 
      regression and ANOVA, controlling for the CAG repeat number of the expanded 
      allele (CAGexp) of each patient, were performed to assess the association between 
      the AHT condition and the AO of the motor symptoms (mAO). The results showed a 
      significant association between AHT and mAO, especially when we only considered 
      the patients diagnosed with AHT prior to manifesting any HD signs (pre-HD AHT). 
      Remarkably, despite the low number of cases, those patients developed motor 
      symptoms 5-8 years later than normotensive patients in the most frequent CAGexp 
      range (40-44). AHT is an age-related condition and consequently, the age of the 
      patient at the time of data collection could be a confounder variable. However, 
      given that most pre-HD AHT patients included in our study had started treatment 
      with antihypertensive drugs prior to the onset of HD, and that antihypertensive 
      drugs have been suggested to confer a neuroprotective effect in other 
      neurodegenerative diseases, raises the interest in elucidating the impact of AHT 
      and/or AHT treatment in HD age of onset in further studies. A confirmation of our 
      results in a larger sample set would open the possibility to significantly 
      improve HD management.

      Neurodegenerative Diseases.

LID - 38
AB  - Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and induced neuronal (iN) cells are very 
      much touted in terms of their potential promises in therapeutics. However, from a 
      more fundamental perspective, iPSCs and iNs are invaluable tools for the 
      postnatal generation of specific diseased cell types from patients, which may 
      offer insights into disease etiology that are otherwise unobtainable with 
      available animal or human proxies. There are two good recent examples of such 
      important insights with diseased neurons derived via either the iPSC or iN 
      approaches. In one, induced motor neurons (iMNs) derived from iPSCs of 
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/Frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD) patients with a 
      C9orf72 repeat expansion revealed a haploinsufficiency of protein function 
      resulting from the intronic expansion and deficiencies in motor neuron vesicular 
      trafficking and lysosomal biogenesis that were not previously obvious in knockout 
      mouse models. In another, striatal medium spinal neurons (MSNs) derived directly 
      from fibroblasts of Huntington&rsquo;s disease (HD) patients recapitulated 
      age-associated disease signatures of mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) aggregation and 
      neurodegeneration that were not prominent in neurons differentiated indirectly 
      via iPSCs from HD patients. These results attest to the tremendous potential for 
      pathologically accurate and mechanistically revealing disease modelling with 
      advances in the derivation of iPSCs and iNs.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurological disorder caused 
      by CAG-repeat expansion in exon 1 of Huntingtin (HTT). But in addition to the 
      neurological disease, mutant HTT (mHTT), which is ubiquitously expressed, impairs 
      other organ systems. Indeed, epidemiological and animal model studies suggest 
      higher incidence of and mortality from heart disease in HD. Here, we show that 
      the protein complex mTORC1 is dysregulated in two HD mouse models through a 
      mechanism that requires intrinsic mHTT expression. Moreover, restoring cardiac 
      mTORC1 activity with constitutively active Rheb prevents mortality and relieves 
      the mHTT-induced block to hypertrophic adaptation to cardiac stress. Finally, we 
      show that chronic mTORC1 dysregulation is due in part to mislocalization of 
      endogenous Rheb. These data provide insight into the increased cardiac-related 
      mortality of HD patients, with cardiac mHTT expression inhibiting mTORC1 
      activity, limiting heart growth, and decreasing the heart's ability to compensate 
      to chronic stress.

TI  - Performance comparison of two whole genome amplification techniques in frame of 
      multifactor preimplantation genetic testing.
PG  - 1457-1472
LID - 10.1007/s10815-018-1187-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare multiple displacement amplification and OmniPlex whole genome 
      amplification technique performance during array comparative genome hybridization 
      (aCGH), Sanger sequencing, SNaPshot and fragment size analysis downstream 
      applications in frame of multifactor embryo preimplantation genetic testing. 
      METHODS: Preclinical workup included linked short tandem repeat (STR) marker 
      selection and primer design for loci of interest. It was followed by a family 
      haplotyping, after which an in vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic 
      testing (IVF-PGT) cycle was carried out. A total of 62 embryos were retrieved 
      from nine couples with a confirmed single gene disorder being transmitted in 
      their family with various inheritance traits-autosomal dominant (genes-ACTA2, 
      HTT, KRT14), autosomal recessive (genes-ALOX12B, TPP1, GLB1) and X-linked 
      (genes-MTM1, DMD). Whole genome amplification (WGA) for the day 5 embryo 
      trophectoderm single biopsies was carried out by multiple displacement 
      amplification (MDA) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technology OmniPlex 
      and was used for direct (Sanger sequencing, fragment size analysis, SNaPshot) and 
      indirect mutation assessment (STR marker haplotyping), and embryo aneuploidy 
      testing by array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH). RESULTS: Family 
      haplotyping revealed informative/semi-informative microsatellite markers for all 
      clinical cases for all types of inheritance. Indirect testing gave a persuasive 
      conclusion for all embryos assessed, which was confirmed through direct testing. 
      The overall allele dropout (ADO) rate was higher for PCR-based WGA, and MDA shows 
      a better genomic recovery scale. Five euploid embryos were subjected to elective 
      single embryo transfer (eSET), which resulted in four clinical pregnancies and 
      birth of two healthy children, which proved free of disease causative variants 
      running in the family postnataly. CONCLUSIONS: A developed multifactor PGT 
      protocol can be adapted and applied to virtually any genetic condition and is 
      capable of improving single gene disorder preimplantation genetic testing in a 
      patient-tailored manner thus increasing pregnancy rates, saving costs and 
      increasing patient reliability.

      Huntington's disease.

LID - 10.1002/hbm.24191 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a monogenic neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG-repeat expansion in the Huntingtin gene. Presence of this expansion signifies 
      certainty of disease onset, but only partly explains age at which onset occurs. 
      Genome-wide association studies have shown that naturally occurring genetic 
      variability influences HD pathogenesis and disease onset. Investigating the 
      influence of biological traits in the normal population, such as variability in 
      white matter properties, on HD pathogenesis could provide a complementary 
      approach to understanding disease modification. We have previously shown that 
      while white matter diffusivity patterns in the left sensorimotor network were 
      similar in controls and HD gene-carriers, they were more extreme in the HD group. 
      We hypothesized that the influence of natural variation in diffusivity on effects 
      of HD pathogenesis on white matter is not limited to the sensorimotor network but 
      extends to cognitive, limbic, and visual networks. Using tractography, we 
      investigated 32 bilateral pathways within HD-related networks, including motor, 
      cognitive, and limbic, and examined diffusivity metrics using principal 
      components analysis. We identified three independent patterns of diffusivity 
      common to controls and HD gene-carriers that predicted HD status. The first 
      pattern involved almost all tracts, the second was limited to sensorimotor 
      tracts, and the third encompassed cognitive network tracts. Each diffusivity 
      pattern was associated with network specific performance. The consistency in 
      diffusivity patterns across both groups coupled with their association with 
      disease status and task performance indicates that naturally-occurring patterns 
      of diffusivity can become accentuated in the presence of the HD gene mutation to 
      influence clinical brain function.

TI  - A Study of Triplet-Primed PCR for Identification of CAG Repeat Expansion in the 
      HTT Gene in a Cohort of 503 Indian Cases with Huntington's Disease Symptoms.
PG  - 353-359
LID - 10.1007/s40291-018-0327-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder with an average age at onset of 40 years. It is a polyglutamine (polyQ) 
      disorder that is caused by an increase in the number of CAG repeats in the 
      huntingtin (HTT) gene. Genetic tests that accurately determine the number of CAG 
      repeats are performed for confirmation of diagnosis, predictive testing of 
      persons at genetic risk for inheriting HD, and prenatal testing. The aim of our 
      study was to evaluate efficacy of triplet-primed polymerase chain reaction 
      (TP-PCR) for routine diagnosis of HD in suspected cases from India. METHODS: We 
      evaluated a combination of CAG flanking PCR and triplet-primed PCR for estimation 
      of CAG repeats in 503 cases with clinical suspicion of HD. RESULTS: There were 
      250 cases (49.7%) that showed the presence of expanded alleles, with 241 (47.9%) 
      being fully penetrant alleles and nine (1.8%) in the reduced penetrance category. 
      There were seven juvenile cases with an age of onset of < 20 years, with the 
      longest allele comprising 106 CAG repeats found in an 8-year-old male patient. 
      The results demonstrated an inverse (R = - 0.67) relationship between CAG length 
      and age at clinical onset. CONCLUSION: Our study on pan-Indian cases is one of 
      the largest studies reported so far in India and focuses on the most accurate and 
      comprehensive molecular diagnostic evaluation of HD.

LID - 75
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by the expansion of CAG repeats in the first exon of the 
      huntingtin gene (HTT). The accumulation of polyglutamine-rich huntingtin proteins 
      affects various cellular functions and causes selective degeneration of neurons 
      in the striatum. Therapeutic strategies used to date to silence the expression of 
      mutant HTT include antisense oligonucleotides, RNA interference-based approaches 
      and, recently, genome editing with the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Here, we demonstrate 
      that the CAG repeat tract can be precisely excised from the HTT gene with the use 
      of the paired Cas9 nickase strategy. As a model, we used HD patient-derived 
      fibroblasts with varied numbers of CAG repeats. The repeat excision inactivated 
      the HTT gene and abrogated huntingtin synthesis in a CAG repeat 
      length-independent manner. Because Cas9 nickases are known to be safe and 
      specific, our approach provides an attractive treatment tool for HD that can be 
      extended to other polyQ disorders.

TI  - CRISPR-Cas9 screens in human cells and primary neurons identify modifiers of 
      C9ORF72 dipeptide-repeat-protein toxicity.
PG  - 603-612
LID - 10.1038/s41588-018-0070-7 [doi]
AB  - Hexanucleotide-repeat expansions in the C9ORF72 gene are the most common cause of 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (c9ALS/FTD). The 
      nucleotide-repeat expansions are translated into dipeptide-repeat (DPR) proteins, 
      which are aggregation prone and may contribute to neurodegeneration. We used the 
      CRISPR-Cas9 system to perform genome-wide gene-knockout screens for suppressors 
      and enhancers of C9ORF72 DPR toxicity in human cells. We validated hits by 
      performing secondary CRISPR-Cas9 screens in primary mouse neurons. We uncovered 
      potent modifiers of DPR toxicity whose gene products function in 
      nucleocytoplasmic transport, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), proteasome, 
      RNA-processing pathways, and chromatin modification. One modifier, TMX2, 
      modulated the ER-stress signature elicited by C9ORF72 DPRs in neurons and 
      improved survival of human induced motor neurons from patients with C9ORF72 ALS. 
      Together, our results demonstrate the promise of CRISPR-Cas9 screens in defining 
      mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - HttQ111/+ Huntington's Disease Knock-in Mice Exhibit Brain Region-Specific 
      Morphological Changes and Synaptic Dysfunction.
PG  - 17-33
LID - 10.3233/JHD-170282 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Successful disease-modifying therapy for Huntington's disease (HD) 
      will require therapeutic intervention early in the pathogenic process. Achieving 
      this goal requires identifying phenotypes that are proximal to the HTT CAG repeat 
      expansion. OBJECTIVE: To use Htt CAG knock-in mice, precise genetic replicas of 
      the HTT mutation in patients, as models to study proximal disease events. 
      METHODS: Using cohorts of B6J.HttQ111/+ mice from 2 to 18 months of age, we 
      analyzed pathological markers, including immunohistochemistry, brain regional 
      volumes and cortical thickness, CAG instability, electron microscopy of striatal 
      synapses, and acute slice electrophysiology to record glutamatergic transmission 
      at striatal synapses. We also incorporated a diet perturbation paradigm for some 
      of these analyses. RESULTS: B6J.HttQ111/+ mice did not exhibit significant 
      neurodegeneration or gliosis but revealed decreased striatal DARPP-32 as well as 
      subtle but regional-specific changes in brain volumes and cortical thickness that 
      parallel those in HD patients. Ultrastructural analyses of the striatum showed 
      reduced synapse density, increased postsynaptic density thickness and increased 
      synaptic cleft width. Acute slice electrophysiology showed alterations in 
      spontaneous AMPA receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents, evoked NMDA 
      receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents, and elevated extrasynaptic 
      NMDA currents. Diet influenced cortical thickness, but did not impact somatic CAG 
      expansion, nor did it show any significant interaction with genotype on 
      immunohistochemical, brain volume or cortical thickness measures. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These data show that a single HttQ111 allele is sufficient to elicit brain 
      region-specific morphological changes and early neuronal dysfunction, 
      highlighting an insidious disease process already apparent in the first few 
      months of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. We previously 
      discovered that mutant Huntingtin sensitizes type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 
      receptor (InsP3R1) to InsP3. This causes calcium leakage from the endoplasmic 
      reticulum (ER) and a compensatory increase in neuronal store-operated calcium 
      (nSOC) entry. We previously demonstrated that supranormal nSOC leads to synaptic 
      loss in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in YAC128 HD mice. OBJECTIVE: We 
      sought to identify calcium channels supporting supranormal nSOC in HD MSNs and to 
      validate these channels as potential therapeutic targets for HD. METHODS: 
      Cortico-striatal cultures were established from wild type and YAC128 HD mice and 
      the density of MSN spines was quantified. The expression of candidate nSOC 
      components was suppressed by RNAi knockdown and by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout. TRPC1 
      knockout mice were crossed with YAC128 HD mice for evaluation of motor 
      performance in a beamwalk assay. RESULTS: RNAi-mediated knockdown of TRPC1, 
      TRPC6, Orai1, or Orai2, but not other TRPC isoforms or Orai3, rescued the density 
      of YAC128 MSN spines. Knockdown of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), an ER 
      calcium sensor and nSOC activator, also rescued YAC128 MSN spines. Knockdown of 
      the same targets suppressed supranormal nSOC in YAC128 MSN spines. These channel 
      subunits co-immunoprecipitated with STIM1 and STIM2 in synaptosomal lysates from 
      mouse striata. Crossing YAC128 mice with TRPC1 knockout mice improved motor 
      performance and rescued MSN spines in vitro and in vivo, indicating that 
      inhibition of TRPC1 may serve as a neuroprotective strategy for HD treatment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: TRPC1 channels constitute a potential therapeutic target for 
      treatment of HD.

TI  - Early Neurodegeneration in R6/2 Mice Carrying the Huntington's Disease Mutation 
      with a Super-Expanded CAG Repeat, Despite Normal Lifespan.
PG  - 61-76
LID - 10.3233/JHD-170265 [doi]
AB  - The threshold of CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene that causes HD is 36 CAG 
      repeats, although 'superlong' expansions are found in individual neurons in 
      postmortem brains. Previously, we showed that, compared to mice with <250 CAG 
      repeats, onset of disease in R6/2 mice carrying superlong (>440) CAG repeat 
      expansions was delayed, and disease progression was slower. Inclusion pathology 
      also differed from 250 CAG repeat mice, being dominated by a novel kind of 
      extranuclear neuronal inclusion (nENNI) that resembles a class of aggregate seen 
      in patients with the adult onset form of HD. Here, we characterised 
      neuropathology in R6/2 mice with >400 CAG repeats using light and electron 
      microscopy. nENNIs were found with increased frequency and wider distribution 
      with age. Some nENNIs appear to 'mature' as the disease develops, developing a 
      multi-layered cored structure. Mice with superlong CAG repeats do not develop 
      clinical signs until they are around 30-40 weeks of age, and they attain a normal 
      life span (>2 years). Nevertheless, they show brain atrophy and unequivocal 
      neuron loss from the striatum and cortex by 22 weeks of age, an age at which 
      similar pathology is seen in 250 CAG repeat mice. Since this time-point is 'end 
      stage' for a 250 CAG mouse, but very far (at least 18 months) from end stage for 
      a >  440 CAG repeat mouse, our data confirm that the appearance of clinical 
      signs, the formation of inclusions, and neurodegeneration are processes that 
      progress independently. A better understanding of the relationship between CAG 
      repeat length, neurodegenerative pathways, and clinical behavioural signs is 
      essential, if we are to find strategies to delay or reverse the course of this 
      disease.

TI  - The cryo-electron microscopy structure of huntingtin.
PG  - 117-120
LID - 10.1038/nature25502 [doi]
AB  - Huntingtin (HTT) is a large (348 kDa) protein that is essential for embryonic 
      development and is involved in diverse cellular activities such as vesicular 
      transport, endocytosis, autophagy and the regulation of transcription. Although 
      an integrative understanding of the biological functions of HTT is lacking, the 
      large number of identified HTT interactors suggests that it serves as a 
      protein-protein interaction hub. Furthermore, Huntington's disease is caused by a 
      mutation in the HTT gene, resulting in a pathogenic expansion of a polyglutamine 
      repeat at the amino terminus of HTT. However, only limited structural information 
      regarding HTT is currently available. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to 
      determine the structure of full-length human HTT in a complex with HTT-associated 
      protein 40 (HAP40; encoded by three F8A genes in humans) to an overall resolution 
      of 4 A. HTT is largely alpha-helical and consists of three major domains. The amino- 
      and carboxy-terminal domains contain multiple HEAT (huntingtin, elongation factor 
      3, protein phosphatase 2A and lipid kinase TOR) repeats arranged in a solenoid 
      fashion. These domains are connected by a smaller bridge domain containing 
      different types of tandem repeats. HAP40 is also largely alpha-helical and has a 
      tetratricopeptide repeat-like organization. HAP40 binds in a cleft and contacts 
      the three HTT domains by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, thereby 
      stabilizing the conformation of HTT. These data rationalize previous biochemical 
      results and pave the way for improved understanding of the diverse cellular 
      functions of HTT.

TI  - Small molecule modulator of protein disulfide isomerase attenuates mutant 
      huntingtin toxicity and inhibits endoplasmic reticulum stress in a mouse model of 
      Huntington's disease.
PG  - 1545-1555
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddy061 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene encoding an elongated 
      polyglutamine tract within the N-terminal of the huntingtin protein (Htt) and 
      leads to Htt misfolding, aberrant protein aggregation, and progressive appearance 
      of disease symptoms. Chronic activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by 
      mutant Htt (mHtt) results in cellular dysfunction and ultimately cell death. 
      Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is a chaperone protein located in the ER. Our 
      previous studies demonstrated that mHtt caused PDI to accumulate at 
      mitochondria-associated ER membranes and triggered cell death, and that 
      modulating PDI activity using small molecules protected cells again mHtt toxicity 
      in cell and brain slice models of HD. In this study, we demonstrated that PDI is 
      upregulated in the HD human brain, in cell and mouse models. Chronic 
      administration of a reversible, brain penetrable small molecule PDI modulator, 
      LOC14 (20 mg/kg/day), significantly improved motor function, attenuated brain 
      atrophy and extended survival in the N171-82Q HD mice. Moreover, LOC14 preserved 
      medium spiny neuronal marker dopamine- and cyclic-AMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 
      molecular weight 32 000 (DARPP32) levels in the striatum of HD mice. Mechanistic 
      study revealed that LOC14 suppressed mHtt-induced ER stress, indicated by 
      repressing the abnormally upregulated ER stress proteins in HD models. These 
      findings suggest that LOC14 is promising to be further optimized for clinical 
      trials of HD, and modulation of signaling pathways coping with ER stress may 
      constitute an attractive approach to reduce mHtt toxicity and identify new 
      therapeutic targets for treatment of HD.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is the most common monogenic neurodegenerative disorder 
      in populations of European ancestry, but occurs at lower prevalence in 
      populations of East Asian or black African descent. New mutations for HD result 
      from CAG repeat expansions of intermediate alleles (IAs), usually of paternal 
      origin. The differing prevalence of HD may be related to the rate of new 
      mutations in a population, but no comparative estimates of IA frequency or the HD 
      new mutation rate are available. In this study, we characterize IA frequency and 
      the CAG repeat distribution in fifteen populations of diverse ethnic origin. We 
      estimate the HD new mutation rate in a series of populations using molecular IA 
      expansion rates. The frequency of IAs was highest in Hispanic Americans and 
      Northern Europeans, and lowest in black Africans and East Asians. The prevalence 
      of HD correlated with the frequency of IAs by population and with the proportion 
      of IAs found on the HD-associated A1 haplotype. The HD new mutation rate was 
      estimated to be highest in populations with the highest frequency of IAs. In 
      European ancestry populations, one in 5,372 individuals from the general 
      population and 7.1% of individuals with an expanded CAG repeat in the HD range 
      are estimated to have a molecular new mutation. Our data suggest that the new 
      mutation rate for HD varies substantially between populations, and that IA 
      frequency and haplotype are closely linked to observed epidemiological 
      differences in the prevalence of HD across major ancestry groups in different 
      countries.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by a progressive movement disorder, psychiatric symptoms, and 
      cognitive impairments. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion encoding a stretch 
      of polyglutamine residues in the N-terminus of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein. 
      Proteolytic processing of mHTT yields toxic fragments, which cause neurotoxicity 
      and massive neuronal cell death predominantly in the striatum and cortex. 
      Inhibition of mHTT cleavage reduces neuronal toxicity suggesting mHTT proteolysis 
      contributes to HD pathogenesis. A previously conducted unbiased siRNA screen in 
      our lab for known human proteases identified matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) as 
      modifiers of mHTT proteolysis and toxicity. To further study MMP activation in 
      HD, isogenic HD, and control corrected (C116) neural stem cells (NSCs) prepared 
      from HD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells were used to examine the 
      role of MMPs and their endogenous inhibitors in this highly relevant model 
      system. We found altered expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 (gelatinases), MMP-3/10, 
      and MMP-14, activity in HD-NSCs when compared to control C116-NSCs. Dysregulation 
      in MMP activity was accompanied with concomitant changes in levels of endogenous 
      inhibitors of MMPs, called tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases 
      (TIMPs). Specifically, we observed decreased levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in 
      HD-NSCs, suggesting part of the altered expression and activity of MMPs is due to 
      lower abundance of these endogenous inhibitors. Immunofluorescence analysis 
      revealed increased MMP/TIMP localization in the nucleus or aggregates of HD-NSCs, 
      suggesting potential interaction with mHTT. TIMP-1 was found to associate with 
      mHTT aggregates in discrete punctate structures in HD-NSCs. These events 
      collectively contribute to increased neurotoxicity in HD. Previous 
      characterization of these NSCs revealed transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) 
      pathway as the top dysregulated pathway in HD. TGF-beta was significantly 
      upregulated in HD-NSCs and addition of TGF-beta to HD-NSCs was found to be 
      neuroprotective. To determine if TGF-beta regulated MMP and TIMP activity, C116- and 
      HD-NSCs were exogenously treated with recombinant TGF-beta. TIMP-1 levels were found 
      to be elevated in response to TGF-beta treatment, representing a potential mechanism 
      through which elevated TGF-beta levels confer neuroprotection in HD. Studying the 
      mechanism of action of MMPs and TIMPs, and their interactions with mHTT in human 
      isogenic patient-derived NSCs elucidates new mechanisms of HD neurotoxicity and 
      will likely provide novel therapeutics for treatment of HD.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative genetic 
      disorder caused by CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the HTT gene. Expression of 
      the mutant gene results in the production of a neurotoxic polyglutamine 
      (polyQ)-expanded huntingtin (Htt) protein. Clinical trials of knockdown therapy 
      of mutant polyglutamine-encoding HTT mRNA in Huntington's disease (HD) have 
      begun. To measure HTT mRNA knockdown effectiveness in human cells, we utilized a 
      fluorescent hybridization imaging agent specific to the region encompassing the 
      human HTT mRNA initiation codon. We designed, synthesized, purified, and 
      characterized Cal560-spacer-peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-spacer-IGF1 tetrapeptides. 
      The human HTT PNA 12mer complement was CATGGCGGTCTC, while the rat htt equivalent 
      12mer contained the sequence CATGaCGGcCTC, with two bases differing from the 
      human sequence. The cyclized IGF1 tetrapeptide fragment d(CSKC) that promotes 
      IGF1 receptor-mediated endocytosis was bonded to the C-terminus. We tested the 
      reliability of HTT mRNA imaging with Cal560-spacer-peptide nucleic acid 
      (PNA)-spacer-IGF1 tetrapeptides in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells that 
      express endogenous HTT and IGF1 receptor. By qPCR, we quantitated HTT mRNA in 
      HEK293T cells with and without HTT mRNA knockdown by three different siRNAs. By 
      confocal fluorescence imaging, we quantitated the accumulation of fluorescent HTT 
      hybridization agent in the same cells. A rat homologue differing from the human 
      sequence by two bases showed negligible fluorescence. qPCR indicated 86 +/- 5% 
      knockdown of HTT mRNA by the most effective siRNA. Similarly, Cal560- HTT 
      PNA-peptide fluorescence intensity indicated 69 +/- 6% reduction in HTT mRNA. We 
      concluded that the fluorescence hybridization method correlates with the 
      established qPCR method for quantitating HTT mRNA knockdown by siRNA in HEK293T 
      cells, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.865 for all three siRNA 
      sequences. These results will enable real time imaging and quantitation of HTT 
      mRNA in animal models of HD.

AB  - The expansion in the C9orf72 gene has been recently reported as a genetic cause 
      of Huntington's disease (HD) phenocopies. We aim to assess the frequency of the 
      C9orf72 gene expansion in a Portuguese HD phenocopies cohort. Twenty HD 
      phenotype-like patients without diagnosis were identified in our institutional 
      database. C9orf72 gene expansion was detected using repeat-primed PCR. Clinical 
      files were reviewed to characterize the phenotype of expansion-positive cases. 
      One patient (5%) was positive for the C9orf72 expansion. A second patient 
      presented 27 repeats-within the intermediate size interval. Both had familial 
      neuropsychiatric disease characterized by diverse movement disorders, dementia, 
      and psychiatric dysfunction that was distinct in severity and clinical 
      expression. C9orf72 disease is clinically heterogeneous and without evident 
      imaging markers. The definition of the role of intermediate alleles and of the 
      pathological threshold for C9orf72 repeat expansions may have diagnostic 
      implications.

AB  - The functionality of a protein depends on its correct folding, but newly 
      synthesized proteins are susceptible to aberrant folding and aggregation. Heat 
      shock proteins (HSPs) function as molecular chaperones that aid in protein 
      folding and the degradation of misfolded proteins. Trinucleotide (CAG) repeat 
      expansion in the Huntingtin gene (HTT) results in the expression of misfolded 
      Huntingtin protein (Htt), which contributes to the development of Huntington's 
      disease. We previously found that the degradation of mutated Htt with polyQ 
      expansion (Htt103QP) depends on both ubiquitin proteasome system and autophagy. 
      However, the role of heat shock proteins in the clearance of mutated Htt remains 
      poorly understood. Here, we report that cytosolic Hsp70 (Ssa family), its 
      nucleotide exchange factors (Sse1 and Fes1), and a Hsp40 co-chaperone (Ydj1) are 
      required for inclusion body formation of Htt103QP proteins and their clearance 
      via autophagy. Extended induction of Htt103QP-GFP leads to the formation of a 
      single inclusion body in wild-type yeast cells, but mutant cells lacking these 
      HSPs exhibit increased number of Htt103QP aggregates. Most notably, we detected 
      more aggregated forms of Htt103QP in sse1Delta mutant cells using an agarose gel 
      assay. Increased protein aggregates are also observed in these HSP mutants even 
      in the absence Htt103QP overexpression. Importantly, these HSPs are required for 
      autophagy-mediated Htt103QP clearance, but are less critical for 
      proteasome-dependent degradation. These findings suggest a chaperone network that 
      facilitates inclusion body formation of misfolded proteins and the subsequent 
      autophagic clearance.

AB  - In Huntington's disease (HD) patients and in model organisms, messenger RNA 
      transcriptome has been extensively studied; in contrast, comparatively little is 
      known about expression and potential role of microRNAs. Using RNA-sequencing, we 
      have quantified microRNA expression in four brain regions and liver, at three 
      different ages, from an allelic series of HD model mice with increasing CAG 
      length in the endogenous Huntingtin gene. Our analyses reveal CAG 
      length-dependent microRNA expression changes in brain, with 159 microRNAs 
      selectively altered in striatum, 102 in cerebellum, 51 in hippocampus, and 45 in 
      cortex. In contrast, a progressive CAG length-dependent microRNA dysregulation 
      was not observed in liver. We further identify microRNAs whose transcriptomic 
      response to CAG length expansion differs significantly among the brain regions 
      and validate our findings in data from a second, independent cohort of mice. 
      Using existing mRNA expression data from the same animals, we assess the possible 
      relationships between microRNA and mRNA expression and highlight candidate 
      microRNAs that are negatively correlated with, and whose predicted targets are 
      enriched in, CAG-length dependent mRNA modules. Several of our top microRNAs 
      (Mir212/Mir132, Mir218, Mir128 and others) have been previously associated with 
      aspects of neuronal development and survival. This study provides an extensive 
      resource for CAG length-dependent changes in microRNA expression in 
      disease-vulnerable and -resistant brain regions in HD mice, and provides new 
      insights for further investigation of microRNAs in HD pathogenesis and 
      therapeutics.

TI  - Whole-Brain Connectivity in a Large Study of Huntington's Disease Gene Mutation 
      Carriers and Healthy Controls.

LID - 10.1089/brain.2017.0538 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited brain disorder characterized by 
      progressive motor, cognitive, and behavioral dysfunctions. It is caused by 
      abnormally large trinucleotide cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansions 
      on exon 1 of the Huntingtin gene. CAG repeat length (CAG-RL) inversely correlates 
      with an earlier age of onset. Region-based studies have shown that HD gene 
      mutation carrier (HDgmc) individuals (CAG-RL >/=36) present functional connectivity 
      alterations in subcortical (SC) and default mode networks. In this analysis, we 
      expand on previous HD studies by investigating associations between CAG-RL and 
      connectivity in the whole brain, as well as between CAG-dependent connectivity 
      and motor and cognitive performances. We used group-independent component 
      analysis on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans of 261 
      individuals (183 HDgmc and 78 healthy controls) from the PREDICT-HD study, to 
      obtain whole-brain resting state networks (RSNs). Regression analysis was applied 
      within and between RSNs connectivity (functional network connectivity [FNC]) to 
      identify CAG-RL associations. Connectivity within the putamen RSN is negatively 
      correlated with CAG-RL. The FNC between putamen and insula decreases with 
      increasing CAG-RL, and also shows significant associations with motor and 
      cognitive measures. The FNC between calcarine and middle frontal gyri increased 
      with CAG-RL. In contrast, FNC in other visual (VIS) networks declined with 
      increasing CAG-RL. In addition to observed effects in SC areas known to be 
      related to HD, our study identifies a strong presence of alterations in VIS 
      regions less commonly observed in previous reports and provides a step forward in 
      understanding FNC dysfunction in HDgmc.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by a (CAG) 
      triplet repeat expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. Inheritance pattern of the 
      disease is autosomal dominant and onset depending on triplet repeat count. 
      Transgenerational HD transmission can be avoided by preimplantation genetic 
      diagnosis (PGD). Here, we report the first preimplantation genetic testing case 
      for monogenic disease, in Latvia. The result of our work led to the birth of 
      healthy child with normal HTT alleles in his genome. We describe a PGD strategy 
      and testing algorithm that can be applied to any couple at risk of transmitting 
      monogenic disease.

      Huntington's disease (HD), six different spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. The 
      expanded CAG repeat length in the causative gene is negatively related to the 
      age-at-onset (AAO) of clinical symptoms. In addition to the expanded CAG repeat 
      length in the causative gene, the normal CAG repeats in the other polyQ genes can 
      affect the AAO, suggesting functional interactions between the polyQ genes. 
      However, there is no detailed assessment of the relationships among polyQ genes 
      in pathologically relevant brain regions. We used gene co-expression analysis to 
      study the functional relationships among polyQ genes in different brain regions 
      using the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), a spatial map of gene expression in the 
      healthy brain. We constructed co-expression networks for seven anatomical brain 
      structures, as well as a region showing a specific pattern of atrophy in HD 
      patients detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. In this 
      HD-associated region, we found that ATN1 and ATXN2 were co-expressed and shared 
      co-expression partners which were enriched for DNA repair genes. We observed a 
      similar co-expression pattern in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and striatum in 
      which this relation was most pronounced. Given that the co-expression patterns 
      for these anatomical structures were similar to those for the HD-associated 
      region, our results suggest that their disruption is likely involved in HD 
      pathology. Moreover, ATN1 and ATXN2 also shared many co-expressed genes with HTT, 
      the causative gene of HD, across the brain. Although this triangular relationship 
      among these three polyQ genes may also be dysregulated in other polyQ diseases, 
      stronger co-expression patterns between ATN1 and ATXN2 observed in the 
      HD-associated region, especially in the striatum, may be more specific to HD.

AB  - Exposure to silica can cause lung fibrosis and cancer. Identification of 
      molecular targets is important for the intervention and/or prevention of 
      silica-induced lung diseases. Telomeres consist of tandem repeats of DNA 
      sequences at the end of chromosomes, preventing chromosomal fusion and 
      degradation. Regulator of telomere length-1 (RTEL1) and telomerase reverse 
      transcriptase (TERT), genes involved in telomere regulation and function, play 
      important roles in maintaining telomere integrity and length. The goal of this 
      study was to assess the effect of silica inhalation on telomere length and the 
      regulation of RTEL1 and TERT. Lung tissues and blood samples were collected from 
      rats at 4, 32, and 44 wk after exposure to 15 mg/m(3) of silica x 6 h/d x 5 d. 
      Controls were exposed to air. At all-time points, RTEL1 expression was 
      significantly decreased in lung tissue of the silica-exposed animals compared to 
      controls. Also, significant increases in telomere length and TERT were observed 
      in the silica group at 4 and 32 wk. Telomere length, RTEL1 and TERT expression 
      may serve as potential biomarkers related to silica exposure and may offer 
      insight into the molecular mechanism of silica-induced lung disease and 
      tumorigeneses.

TI  - Brain urea increase is an early Huntington's disease pathogenic event observed in 
      a prodromal transgenic sheep model and HD cases.
PG  - E11293-E11302
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1711243115 [doi]
AB  - The neurodegenerative disorder Huntington's disease (HD) is typically 
      characterized by extensive loss of striatal neurons and the midlife onset of 
      debilitating and progressive chorea, dementia, and psychological disturbance. HD 
      is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene, translating to 
      an elongated glutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. The pathogenic mechanism 
      resulting in cell dysfunction and death beyond the causative mutation is not well 
      defined. To further delineate the early molecular events in HD, we performed 
      RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on striatal tissue from a cohort of 5-y-old OVT73-line 
      sheep expressing a human CAG-expansion HTT cDNA transgene. Our HD OVT73 sheep are 
      a prodromal model and exhibit minimal pathology and no detectable neuronal loss. 
      We identified significantly increased levels of the urea transporter SLC14A1 in 
      the OVT73 striatum, along with other important osmotic regulators. Further 
      investigation revealed elevated levels of the metabolite urea in the OVT73 
      striatum and cerebellum, consistent with our recently published observation of 
      increased urea in postmortem human brain from HD cases. Extending that finding, 
      we demonstrate that postmortem human brain urea levels are elevated in a larger 
      cohort of HD cases, including those with low-level neuropathology (Vonsattel 
      grade 0/1). This elevation indicates increased protein catabolism, possibly as an 
      alternate energy source given the generalized metabolic defect in HD. Increased 
      urea and ammonia levels due to dysregulation of the urea cycle are known to cause 
      neurologic impairment. Taken together, our findings indicate that aberrant urea 
      metabolism could be the primary biochemical disruption initiating 
      neuropathogenesis in HD.

TI  - PPARdelta activation by bexarotene promotes neuroprotection by restoring bioenergetic 
      and quality control homeostasis.
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.aal2332 [doi]
LID - eaal2332
AB  - Neurons must maintain protein and mitochondrial quality control for optimal 
      function, an energetically expensive process. The peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ligand-activated transcription 
      factors that promote mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism. We 
      recently determined that transcriptional dysregulation of PPARdelta contributes to 
      Huntington's disease (HD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting 
      from a CAG-polyglutamine repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. We documented 
      that the PPARdelta agonist KD3010 is an effective therapy for HD in a mouse model. 
      PPARdelta forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), and RXR agonists 
      are capable of promoting PPARdelta activation. One compound with potent RXR agonist 
      activity is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug bexarotene. We 
      tested the therapeutic potential of bexarotene in HD and found that bexarotene 
      was neuroprotective in cellular models of HD, including medium spiny-like neurons 
      generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients with 
      HD. To evaluate bexarotene as a treatment for HD, we treated the N171-82Q mouse 
      model with the drug and found that bexarotene improved motor function, reduced 
      neurodegeneration, and increased survival. To determine the basis for PPARdelta 
      neuroprotection, we evaluated metabolic function and noted markedly impaired 
      oxidative metabolism in HD neurons, which was rescued by bexarotene or KD3010. We 
      examined mitochondrial and protein quality control in cellular models of HD and 
      observed that treatment with a PPARdelta agonist promoted cellular quality control. 
      By boosting cellular activities that are dysfunctional in HD, PPARdelta activation 
      may have therapeutic applications in HD and potentially other neurodegenerative 
      diseases.

AB  - Posttranslational modifications can have profound effects on the biological and 
      biophysical properties of proteins associated with misfolding and aggregation. 
      However, their detection and quantification in clinical samples and an 
      understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathological properties of 
      misfolding- and aggregation-prone proteins remain a challenge for diagnostics and 
      therapeutics development. We have applied an ultrasensitive immunoassay platform 
      to develop and validate a quantitative assay for detecting a posttranslational 
      modification (phosphorylation at residue T3) of a protein associated with 
      polyglutamine repeat expansion, namely Huntingtin, and characterized its presence 
      in a variety of preclinical and clinical samples. We find that T3 phosphorylation 
      is greatly reduced in samples from Huntington's disease models and in 
      Huntington's disease patients, and we provide evidence that bona-fide T3 
      phosphorylation alters Huntingtin exon 1 protein conformation and aggregation 
      properties. These findings have significant implications for both mechanisms of 
      disease pathogenesis and the development of therapeutics and diagnostics for 
      Huntington's disease.

TI  - Altered Aconitase 2 Activity in Huntington's Disease Peripheral Blood Cells and 
      Mouse Model Striatum.
LID - 10.3390/ijms18112480 [doi]
LID - 2480
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an unstable cytosine adenine guanine (CAG) 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion encoding a polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin 
      protein. Previously, we identified several up- and down-regulated protein 
      molecules in the striatum of the Hdh((CAG)150) knock-in mice at 16 months of age, 
      a mouse model which is modeling the early human HD stage. Among those molecules, 
      aconitase 2 (Aco2) located in the mitochondrial matrix is involved in the energy 
      generation and susceptible to increased oxidative stress that would lead to 
      inactivation of Aco2 activity. In this study, we demonstrate decreased Aco2 
      protein level and activity in the brain of both Hdh((CAG)150) and R6/2 mice. Aco2 
      activity was decreased in striatum of Hdh((CAG)150) mice at 16 months of age as 
      well as R6/2 mice at 7 to 13 weeks of age. Aco2 activity in the striatum of R6/2 
      mice could be restored by the anti-oxidant, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, supporting that 
      decreased Aco2 activity in HD is probably caused by increased oxidative damage. 
      Decreased Aco2 activity was further found in the peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells (PBMC) of both HD patients and pre-symptomatic HD mutation (PreHD) 
      carriers, while the decreased Aco2 protein level of PBMC was only present in HD 
      patients. Aco2 activity correlated significantly with motor score, independence 
      scale, and functional capacity of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale 
      as well as disease duration. Our study provides a potential biomarker to assess 
      the disease status of HD patients and PreHD carriers.

AB  - Eukaryotic translation is tightly regulated to ensure that protein production 
      occurs at the right time and place. Recent studies on abnormal repeat proteins, 
      especially in age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases caused by nucleotide 
      repeat expansion, have highlighted or identified two forms of unconventional 
      translation initiation: usage of AUG-like sites (near cognates) or 
      repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. We discuss how repeat proteins may 
      differ due to not just unconventional initiation, but also ribosomal 
      frameshifting and/or imperfect repeat DNA replication, expansion, and repair, and 
      we highlight how research on translation of repeats may uncover insights into the 
      biology of translation and its contribution to disease.

TI  - Peripheral markers of autophagy in polyglutamine diseases.
PG  - 149-152
LID - 10.1007/s10072-017-3156-6 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine disorders are neurodegenerative diseases that share a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the coding region, resulting in aggregated proteins that can be only 
      degraded through aggrephagy. We measured the expression of autophagy genes in 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 20 patients with Huntington's disease (HD), 
      20 with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), and 20 healthy individuals. HD 
      patients showed increased expression of MAP1LC3B (+ 43%; p = 0.048), SQSTM1 
      (+ 49%; p = 0.002), and WDFY3 (+ 89%; p < 0.001). SCA2 patients had increased 
      expression of WDFY3 (+ 69%; p < 0.001). We show that peripheral markers of 
      autophagy are elevated in polyQ diseases, and this is particularly evident in HD.

AB  - Trinucleotide repeat (TNR) tracts are inherently unstable during DNA replication, 
      leading to repeat expansions and/or contractions. Expanded tracts are the cause 
      of over 40 neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. In this chapter, we 
      focus on the (CNG)(n) repeat sequences that, when expanded, lead to Huntington's 
      disease (HD), myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), and a number of other 
      neurodegenerative diseases. We describe a series of in vivo assays, using the 
      model system Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to determine and characterize the dynamic 
      behavior of TNR tracts that are in the early stages of expansion, i.e., the 
      so-called threshold range. Through a series of time courses and PCR-based assays, 
      dynamic changes in tract length can be observed as a function of time. These 
      assays can ultimately be used to determine how genetic factors influence the 
      process of tract expansion in these early stages.

TI  - Neuropathological Comparison of Adult Onset and Juvenile Huntington's Disease 
      with Cerebellar Atrophy: A Report of a Father and Son.
PG  - 337-348
LID - 10.3233/JHD-170261 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat expansion in huntingtin (HTT) on 
      chromosome 4. Anticipation can cause longer repeat expansions in children of HD 
      patients. Juvenile Huntington's disease (JHD), defined as HD arising before age 
      20, accounts for 5-10% of HD cases, with cases arising in the first decade 
      accounting for approximately 1%. Clinically, JHD differs from the predominately 
      choreiform adult onset Huntington's disease (AOHD) with variable presentations, 
      including symptoms such as myoclonus, seizures, Parkinsonism, and cognitive 
      decline. OBJECTIVE: The neuropathologic changes of AOHD are well characterized, 
      but there are fewer reports that describe the neuropathology of JHD. Here we 
      report a case of a six-year-old boy with paternally-inherited JHD caused by 169 
      CAG trinucleotide repeats who presented at age four with developmental delay, 
      dysarthria, and seizures before dying at age 6. The boy's clinical presentation 
      and neuropathological findings are directly compared to those of his father, who 
      presented with AOHD and 54 repeats. METHODS: A full autopsy was performed for the 
      JHD case and a brain-only autopsy was performed for the AOHD case. 
      Histochemically- and immunohistochemically-stained slides were prepared from 
      formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. RESULTS: Both cases had 
      neuropathology corresponding to Vonsattel grade 3. The boy also had cerebellar 
      atrophy with huntingtin-positive inclusions in the cerebellum, findings not 
      present in the father. CONCLUSIONS: Autopsies of father and son provide a unique 
      opportunity to compare and contrast the neuropathologic findings of juvenile and 
      adult onset HD while also providing the first immunohistochemical evidence of 
      cerebellar involvement in JHD. Additionally this is the first known report to 
      include findings from peripheral tissue in a case of JHD.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion that encodes a 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the HD disease protein, huntingtin (HTT). 
      PolyQ expansion promotes misfolding and aggregation of mutant HTT (mHTT) within 
      neurons. The cellular pathways, including ubiquitin-dependent processes, by which 
      mHTT is regulated remain incompletely understood. Ube2W is the only ubiquitin 
      conjugating enzyme (E2) known to ubiquitinate substrates at their amino 
      (N)-termini, likely favoring substrates with disordered N-termini. By virtue of 
      its N-terminal polyQ domain, HTT has an intrinsically disordered amino terminus. 
      In studies employing immortalized cells, primary neurons and a knock-in (KI) 
      mouse model of HD, we tested the effect of Ube2W deficiency on mHTT levels, 
      aggregation and neurotoxicity. In cultured cells, deficiency of Ube2W activity 
      markedly decreases mHTT aggregate formation and increases the level of soluble 
      monomers, while reducing mHTT-induced cytotoxicity. Consistent with this result, 
      the absence of Ube2W in HdhQ200 KI mice significantly increases levels of soluble 
      monomeric mHTT while reducing insoluble oligomeric species. This study sheds 
      light on the potential function of the non-canonical ubiquitin-conjugating 
      enzyme, Ube2W, in this polyQ neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Huntington's chorea or Huntington disease (HD) is a late-onset autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion. The 
      multidisciplinary study of HD has been the focus of an international 
      collaborating effort of basic and applied research for several decades. HD was 
      the first human genetic disease mapped using linkage analysis of DNA 
      polymorphisms and became a paradigm for scores of genes mapped in the same 
      manner. Presymptomatic and prenatal testing have been available for HD families 
      in the last 30 years, following genetic counseling and careful bioethical 
      guidelines. Nevertheless, with the cure for the disease still elusive the uptake 
      of predictive testing by at risk individuals is low. Current treatment of HD is 
      mostly symptomatic, but ongoing observational studies, clinical trials and 
      development of new gene silencing technologies have provided hopeful results.

TI  - The effects of optimism, religion, and hope on mood and anxiety disorders in 
      women with the FMR1 premutation.
PG  - 916-927
LID - 10.1111/jir.12409 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The FMR1 premutation, caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      on the FMR1 gene, has been identified as a genetic risk factor for mood and 
      anxiety disorders. Building on recent studies identifying increased risk for mood 
      and affective disorders in this population, we examined effects of potential 
      protective factors (optimism, religion, hope) on depression and anxiety diagnoses 
      in a prospective, longitudinal cohort. METHODS: Eighty-three women with the FMR1 
      premutation participated in the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR 
      Disorders at two-time points, 3 years apart. Participants also completed measures 
      of optimism, religion, personal faith, hope, and child and family 
      characteristics. We used logistic regression to examine correlates of major 
      depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders at the initial assessment, as 
      well as predictors of the diagnostic course over time. RESULTS: Lower optimism 
      and higher religious participation relevant to fragile X syndrome at the initial 
      assessment were associated with a lifetime history of MDD. Lower optimism also 
      predicted the occurrence and reoccurrence of an anxiety disorder 3 years later. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In women with the FMR1 premutation, elevated optimism may reduce the 
      occurrence or severity of MDD and anxiety disorders. These findings underscore 
      the importance of supporting mental health across the FMR1 spectrum of 
      involvement.

TI  - Selected missense mutations impair frataxin processing in Friedreich ataxia.
PG  - 575-584
LID - 10.1002/acn3.433 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Frataxin (FXN) is a highly conserved mitochondrial protein. Reduced 
      FXN levels cause Friedreich ataxia, a recessive neurodegenerative disease. 
      Typical patients carry GAA repeat expansions on both alleles, while a subgroup of 
      patients carry a missense mutation on one allele and a GAA repeat expansion on 
      the other. Here, we report that selected disease-related FXN missense mutations 
      impair FXN localization, interaction with mitochondria processing peptidase, and 
      processing. METHODS: Immunocytochemical studies and subcellular fractionation 
      were performed to study FXN import into the mitochondria and examine the 
      mechanism by which mutations impair FXN processing. Coimmunoprecipitation was 
      performed to study the interaction between FXN and mitochondrial processing 
      peptidase. A proteasome inhibitor was used to model traditional therapeutic 
      strategies. In addition, clinical profiles of subjects with and without point 
      mutations were compared in a large natural history study. RESULTS: FXN(I)(154F) 
      and FXN(G)(130V) missense mutations decrease FXN (81-210) levels compared with 
      FXN(WT), FXN(R)(165C), and FXN(W)(155R), but do not block its association with 
      mitochondria. FXN(I)(154F) and FXN(G)(130V) also impair FXN maturation and 
      enhance the binding between FXN (42-210) and mitochondria processing peptidase. 
      Furthermore, blocking proteosomal degradation does not increase FXN (81-210) 
      levels. Additionally, impaired FXN processing also occurs in fibroblasts from 
      patients with FXN(G)(130V). Finally, clinical data from patients with 
      FXN(G)(130V) and FXN(I)(154F) mutations demonstrates a lower severity compared 
      with other individuals with Friedreich ataxia. INTERPRETATION: These data suggest 
      that the effects on processing associated with FXN(G)(130V) and FXN(I)(154F) 
      mutations lead to higher levels of partially processed FXN, which may contribute 
      to the milder clinical phenotypes in these patients.

AB  - Huntington's disease is caused by polyglutamine (polyQ)-expansion mutations in 
      the CAG tandem repeat of the Huntingtin gene. The central feature of Huntington's 
      disease pathology is the aggregation of mutant Huntingtin (Htt) protein into 
      micrometer-sized inclusion bodies. Soluble mutant Htt states are most proteotoxic 
      and trigger an enhanced risk of death whereas inclusions confer different changes 
      to cellular health, and may even provide adaptive responses to stress. Yet the 
      molecular mechanisms underpinning these changes remain unclear. Using the flow 
      cytometry method of pulse-shape analysis (PulSA) to sort neuroblastoma (Neuro2a) 
      cells enriched with mutant or wild-type Htt into different aggregation states, we 
      clarified which transcriptional signatures were specifically attributable to 
      cells before versus after inclusion assembly. Dampened CREB signalling was the 
      most striking change overall and invoked specifically by soluble mutant Httex1 
      states. Toxicity could be rescued by stimulation of CREB signalling. Other 
      biological processes mapped to different changes before and after aggregation 
      included NF-kB signalling, autophagy, SUMOylation, transcription regulation by 
      histone deacetylases and BRD4, NAD+ biosynthesis, ribosome biogenesis and altered 
      HIF-1 signalling. These findings open the path for therapeutic strategies 
      targeting key molecular changes invoked prior to, and subsequently to, Httex1 
      aggregation.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder whose major symptoms 
      include progressive motor and cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive decline is a 
      critical quality of life concern for HD patients and families. The enzyme histone 
      deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) appears to be important in HD pathology by negatively 
      regulating genes involved in cognitive functions. Furthermore, HDAC3 has been 
      implicated in the aberrant transcriptional patterns that help cause disease 
      symptoms in HD mice. HDAC3 also helps fuel CAG repeat expansions in human cells, 
      suggesting that HDAC3 may power striatal expansions in the HTT gene thought to 
      drive disease progression. This multifaceted role suggests that early HDAC3 
      inhibition offers an attractive mechanism to prevent HD cognitive decline and to 
      suppress striatal expansions. This hypothesis was investigated by treating 
      Hdh(Q111) knock-in mice with the HDAC3-selective inhibitor RGFP966. Chronic early 
      treatment prevented long-term memory impairments and normalized specific 
      memory-related gene expression in hippocampus. Additionally, RGFP966 prevented 
      corticostriatal-dependent motor learning deficits, significantly suppressed 
      striatal CAG repeat expansions, partially rescued striatal protein marker 
      expression and reduced accumulation of mutant huntingtin oligomeric forms. These 
      novel results highlight RGFP966 as an appealing multiple-benefit therapy in HD 
      that concurrently prevents cognitive decline and suppresses striatal CAG repeat 
      expansions.

AB  - Huntington's Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant progressive neurodegenerative 
      disorder characterized by cognitive, behavioral and motor dysfunctions. HD is 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the HD gene that is translated into 
      an expanded polyglutamine tract in the encoded protein, huntingtin (HTT). While 
      the most significant neuropathology of HD occurs in the striatum, other brain 
      regions are also affected and play an important role in HD pathology. To date 
      there is no cure for HD, and recently strategies aiming at silencing HTT 
      expression have been initiated as possible therapeutics for HD. However, the 
      essential functions of HTT in the adult brain are currently unknown and hence the 
      consequence of sustained suppression of HTT expression is unpredictable and can 
      potentially be deleterious. Using the Cre-loxP system of recombination, we 
      conditionally inactivated the mouse HD gene homologue at 3, 6 and 9 months of 
      age. Here we show that elimination of Htt expression in the adult mouse results 
      in behavioral deficits, progressive neuropathological changes including bilateral 
      thalamic calcification, and altered brain iron homeostasis.

TI  - Mapping the order and pattern of brain structural MRI changes using change-point 
      analysis in premanifest Huntington's disease.

LID - 10.1002/hbm.23713 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      that progressively affects motor, cognitive, and emotional functions. Structural 
      MRI studies have demonstrated brain atrophy beginning many years prior to 
      clinical onset ("premanifest" period), but the order and pattern of brain 
      structural changes have not been fully characterized. In this study, we 
      investigated brain regional volumes and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 
      measurements in premanifest HD, and we aim to determine (1) the extent of MRI 
      changes in a large number of structures across the brain by atlas-based analysis, 
      and (2) the initiation points of structural MRI changes in these brain regions. 
      We adopted a novel multivariate linear regression model to detect the inflection 
      points at which the MRI changes begin (namely, "change-points"), with respect to 
      the CAG-age product (CAP, an indicator of extent of exposure to the effects of 
      CAG repeat expansion). We used approximately 300 T1-weighted and DTI data from 
      premanifest HD and control subjects in the PREDICT-HD study, with atlas-based 
      whole brain segmentation and change-point analysis. The results indicated a 
      distinct topology of structural MRI changes: the change-points of the volumetric 
      measurements suggested a central-to-peripheral pattern of atrophy from the 
      striatum to the deep white matter; and the change points of DTI measurements 
      indicated the earliest changes in mean diffusivity in the deep white matter and 
      posterior white matter. While interpretation needs to be cautious given the 
      cross-sectional nature of the data, these findings suggest a spatial and temporal 
      pattern of spread of structural changes within the HD brain. Hum Brain Mapp

TI  - Association between serotonin transporter polymorphisms (5-HTTLPR) and the MADRS 
      Dysphoria, Retardation, and Vegetative Subscale scores in the treatment of 
      depression.
PG  - 1463-1469
LID - 10.2147/NDT.S123708 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between serotonin- or 
      5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-related gene polymorphisms and response to 
      antidepressant treatment in a specific symptom cluster of major depression by 
      using the three-factor model of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale 
      (MADRS), ie, dysphoria (items of sadness, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal 
      thoughts), retardation (items of lassitude, inability to feel, apparent sadness, 
      and concentration difficulties), and vegetative symptoms (items of reduced sleep, 
      reduced appetite, and inner tension). METHODS: This study was an open-label and 
      nonrandomized trial. A total of 160 patients with baseline MADRS scores of >/=21, 
      who were treated with fluvoxamine or milnacipran for 6 weeks, were included in 
      the statistical analysis. Polymorphisms within a 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) 
      gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), a variable number of tandem repeats in 
      the second intron of the 5-HTT gene (5-HTTVNTR), and 5HT2A receptor (1438G/A) 
      were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: The 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms affected the MADRS 
      score change in dysphoria, but not in retardation, vegetative, or total symptoms. 
      Dysphoria scores significantly decreased in patients with the S/S genotype 
      compared to those in patients with the short (S)/long (L) + L/L genotype. 
      However, 5-HTTVNTR and 1438G/A polymorphisms were not significantly associated 
      with the treatment response to any cluster of depressive symptoms. When a 
      Bonferroni correction was made, however, our results did not reach the criteria 
      for statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The use of a single total depression 
      rating scale may not be sufficient to accurately estimate the clinical response 
      to antidepressants. Analyzing a subset of symptoms in psychological scales could 
      be important when performing pharmacogenetic studies.

TI  - Identification of genetic variants associated with Huntington's disease 
      progression: a genome-wide association study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the 
      huntingtin gene, HTT. Age at onset has been used as a quantitative phenotype in 
      genetic analysis looking for Huntington's disease modifiers, but is hard to 
      define and not always available. Therefore, we aimed to generate a novel measure 
      of disease progression and to identify genetic markers associated with this 
      progression measure. METHODS: We generated a progression score on the basis of 
      principal component analysis of prospectively acquired longitudinal changes in 
      motor, cognitive, and imaging measures in the 218 indivduals in the TRACK-HD 
      cohort of Huntington's disease gene mutation carriers (data collected 2008-11). 
      We generated a parallel progression score using data from 1773 previously 
      genotyped participants from the European Huntington's Disease Network REGISTRY 
      study of Huntington's disease mutation carriers (data collected 2003-13). We did 
      a genome-wide association analyses in terms of progression for 216 TRACK-HD 
      participants and 1773 REGISTRY participants, then a meta-analysis of these 
      results was undertaken. FINDINGS: Longitudinal motor, cognitive, and imaging 
      scores were correlated with each other in TRACK-HD participants, justifying use 
      of a single, cross-domain measure of disease progression in both studies. The 
      TRACK-HD and REGISTRY progression measures were correlated with each other 
      (r=0.674), and with age at onset (TRACK-HD, r=0.315; REGISTRY, r=0.234). The 
      meta-analysis of progression in TRACK-HD and REGISTRY gave a genome-wide 
      significant signal (p=1.12 x 10(-10)) on chromosome 5 spanning three genes: MSH3, 
      DHFR, and MTRNR2L2. The genes in this locus were associated with progression in 
      TRACK-HD (MSH3 p=2.94 x 10(-8)DHFR p=8.37 x 10(-7) MTRNR2L2 p=2.15 x 10(-9)) and 
      to a lesser extent in REGISTRY (MSH3 p=9.36 x 10(-4)DHFR p=8.45 x 10(-4)MTRNR2L2 
      p=1.20 x 10(-3)). The lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in TRACK-HD 
      (rs557874766) was genome-wide significant in the meta-analysis (p=1.58 x 10(-8)), 
      and encodes an aminoacid change (Pro67Ala) in MSH3. In TRACK-HD, each copy of the 
      minor allele at this SNP was associated with a 0.4 units per year (95% CI 
      0.16-0.66) reduction in the rate of change of the Unified Huntington's Disease 
      Rating Scale (UHDRS) Total Motor Score, and a reduction of 0.12 units per year 
      (95% CI 0.06-0.18) in the rate of change of UHDRS Total Functional Capacity 
      score. These associations remained significant after adjusting for age of onset. 
      INTERPRETATION: The multidomain progression measure in TRACK-HD was associated 
      with a functional variant that was genome-wide significant in our meta-analysis. 
      The association in only 216 participants implies that the progression measure is 
      a sensitive reflection of disease burden, that the effect size at this locus is 
      large, or both. Knockout of Msh3 reduces somatic expansion in Huntington's 
      disease mouse models, suggesting this mechanism as an area for future therapeutic 
      investigation. FUNDING: The European Commission FP7 NeurOmics project; CHDI 
      Foundation; the Medical Research Council UK; the Brain Research Trust; and the

AB  - The fact that the heritable neurodegenerative disorder Huntington's disease (HD) 
      is autosomal dominant means that there is one wild type and one mutant allele in 
      most HD patients. The CAG repeat expansion in the exon 1 of the protein 
      huntingtin (HTT(ex1)) that causes the disease leads to the formation of HTT 
      fibrils in vitro and vivo. An important question for understanding the molecular 
      mechanism of HD is which role wild type HTT plays for the formation, propagation, 
      and structure of these HTT fibrils. Here we report that fibrils of mutant 
      HTT(ex1) are able to seed the aggregation of wild type HTT(ex1) into amyloid 
      fibrils, which in turn can seed the fibril formation of mutant HTT(ex1). 
      Solid-state NMR and electron paramagnetic resonance data showed that wild type 
      HTT(ex1) fibrils closely resemble the structure of mutant fibrils, with small 
      differences indicating a less extended fibril core. These data suggest that wild 
      type fibrils can faithfully perpetuate the structure of mutant fibrils in HD. 
      However, wild type HTT(ex1) monomers have a much higher equilibrium solubility 
      compared to mutant HTT(ex1), and only a small fraction incorporates into fibrils.

TI  - Structure and Dynamics of RNA Repeat Expansions That Cause Huntington's Disease 
      and Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1.
PG  - 3463-3474
LID - 10.1021/acs.biochem.7b00252 [doi]
AB  - RNA repeat expansions cause a host of incurable, genetically defined diseases. 
      The most common class of RNA repeats consists of trinucleotide repeats. These 
      long, repeating transcripts fold into hairpins containing 1 x 1 internal loops 
      that can mediate disease via a variety of mechanism(s) in which RNA is the 
      central player. Two of these disorders are Huntington's disease and myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1, which are caused by r(CAG) and r(CUG) repeats, respectively. We 
      report the structures of two RNA constructs containing three copies of a r(CAG) 
      [r(3xCAG)] or r(CUG) [r(3xCUG)] motif that were modeled with nuclear magnetic 
      resonance spectroscopy and simulated annealing with restrained molecular 
      dynamics. The 1 x 1 internal loops of r(3xCAG) are stabilized by one-hydrogen 
      bond (cis Watson-Crick/Watson-Crick) AA pairs, while those of r(3xCUG) prefer 
      one- or two-hydrogen bond (cis Watson-Crick/Watson-Crick) UU pairs. Assigned 
      chemical shifts for the residues depended on the identity of neighbors or next 
      nearest neighbors. Additional insights into the dynamics of these RNA constructs 
      were gained by molecular dynamics simulations and a discrete path sampling 
      method. Results indicate that the global structures of the RNA are A-form and 
      that the loop regions are dynamic. The results will be useful for understanding 
      the dynamic trajectory of these RNA repeats but also may aid in the development 
      of therapeutics.

      Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission: genotypic clustering of cases in 
      Michigan, 2004-2012.

AB  - PURPOSE: Using genotyping data of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from new 
      cases reported to the tuberculosis (TB) surveillance program, we evaluated risk 
      factors for recent TB transmission at both the individual- and neighborhood- 
      levels among U.S.-born and foreign-born populations. METHODS: TB cases (N = 1236) 
      reported in Michigan during 2004 to 2012 were analyzed using multivariable 
      Poisson regression models to examine risk factors for recent transmission 
      cross-sectionally for U.S.-born and foreign-born populations separately. Recent 
      transmission was defined based on spoligotype and 12-locus-mycobacterial 
      interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat typing matches of 
      bacteria from cases that were diagnosed within 1 year of each other. Four classes 
      of predictor variables were examined: demographic factors, known TB risk factors, 
      clinical characteristics, and neighborhood-level factors. RESULTS: Overall, 22% 
      of the foreign-born cases resulted from recent transmission. Among the 
      foreign-born, race and being a contact of an infectious TB case were significant 
      predictors of recent transmission. More than half (52%) of U.S.-born cases 
      resulted from recent transmission. Among the U.S.-born, recent transmission was 
      predicted by both individual- and neighborhood-level sociodemographic 
      characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions aimed at reducing TB incidence among 
      foreign-born should focus on reducing reactivation of latent infection. However, 
      reducing TB incidence among the U.S.-born will require decreasing transmission 
      among socially disadvantaged groups at the individual- and neighborhood- levels. 
      This report fills an important knowledge gap regarding the contemporary social 
      context of TB in the United States, thereby providing a foundation for future 
      studies of public health policies that can lead to the development of more 
      targeted, effective TB control.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG repeat 
      expansion within exon1 of the HTT gene. The gene generates two mRNA variants that 
      carry either a short or long 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) while encoding the 
      same protein. It remains unknown whether the two mRNA variants play distinct 
      roles in HD pathogenesis. We found that the long HTT 3'UTR was capable of guiding 
      mRNA to neuronal dendrites, suggesting that some long-form HTT mRNA is 
      transported to dendrites for local protein synthesis. To assay roles of two HTT 
      mRNA variants in cell bodies, we expressed mRNA harboring HTT exon1 containing 
      23x or 145x CAGs with the short or long 3'UTR. We found that mutant mRNA 
      containing the short 3'UTR produced more protein aggregates and caused more 
      apoptosis in both cultured neurons and HEK293 cells, compared with mutant mRNA 
      containing the long 3'UTR. Although the two 3'UTRs did not affect mRNA stability, 
      we detected higher levels of protein synthesis from mRNA containing the short 
      3'UTR than from mRNA containing the long 3'UTR. These results indicate that the 
      long HTT 3'UTR suppresses translation. Thus, short-form mutant HTT mRNA will be 
      more efficient in producing toxic protein than its long-form counterpart.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder typically affecting male premutation carriers with 
      55-200 CGG trinucleotide repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene after age 50. The aim 
      of this study was to examine whether cerebellar and brainstem changes emerge 
      during development or aging in late life. We retrospectively analyzed magnetic 
      resonance imaging scans from 322 males (age 8-81 years). Volume changes in the 
      cerebellum and brainstem were contrasted with those in the ventricles and whole 
      brain. Compared to the controls, premutation carriers without FXTAS showed 
      significantly accelerated volume decrease in the cerebellum and whole brain, 
      flatter inverted U-shaped trajectory of the brainstem, and larger ventricles. 
      Compared to both older controls and premutation carriers without FXTAS, carriers 
      with FXTAS exhibited significant volume decrease in the cerebellum and whole 
      brain and accelerated volume decrease in the brainstem. We therefore conclude 
      that cerebellar and brainstem volumes were likely affected during both 
      development and progression of neurodegeneration in premutation carriers, 
      suggesting that interventions may need to start early in adulthood to be most 
      effective.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the first exon of the gene huntingtin. There is no treatment to 
      prevent or delay the disease course of HD currently. Oxidative stress and 
      mitochondrial dysfunction have emerged as key determinants of the disease 
      progression in HD. Therefore, counteracting mutant huntingtin (mHtt)-induced 
      oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction appears as a new approach to treat 
      this devastating disease. Interestingly, mild mitochondrial uncoupling improves 
      neuronal resistance to stress and facilitates neuronal survival. Mild 
      mitochondrial uncoupling can be induced by the proper dose of 2,4-dinitrophenol 
      (DNP), a proton ionophore that was previously used for weight loss. In this 
      study, we evaluated the effects of chronic administration of DNP at three doses 
      (0.5, 1, 5mg/kg/day) on mHtt-induced behavioral deficits and cellular 
      abnormalities in the N171-82Q HD mouse model. DNP at a low dose (1mg/kg/day) 
      significantly improved motor function and preserved medium spiny neuronal marker 
      DARPP32 and postsynaptic protein PSD95 in the striatum of HD mice. Further 
      mechanistic study suggests that DNP at this dose reduced oxidative stress in HD 
      mice, which was indicated by reduced levels of F2-isoprostanes in the brain of HD 
      mice treated with DNP. Our data indicated that DNP provided behavioral benefit 
      and neuroprotective effect at a weight neutral dose in HD mice, suggesting that 
      the potential value of repositioning DNP to HD treatment is warranted in 
      well-controlled clinical trials in HD.

AB  - Mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) gene causes Huntington's disease (HD). It is an 
      autosomal dominant trinucleotide-repeat expansion disease in which CAG repeat 
      sequence expands to >35. This results in the production of mutant HTT protein 
      with an increased stretch of glutamines near the N-terminus. The wild type HTT 
      gene encodes a 350 kD protein whose function remains elusive. Mutant HTT protein 
      has been implicated in transcription, axonal transport, cytoskeletal 
      structure/function, signal transduction, and autophagy. HD is characterized by 
      the appearance of nuclear inclusions and degeneration of the striatum. Although 
      HTT protein is expressed early in embryos, most patients develop symptoms in 
      mid-life. It is also unclear why the ubiquitously expressed mutant HTT 
      specifically causes striatal atrophy. Wild type Htt is essential for development 
      as Htt knockout mice die at day E7.5. Increasing evidence suggests mutant Htt may 
      alter neurogenesis and development of striatal neurons resulting in neuronal 
      loss. Using a mouse embryonic stem cell model, we examined the role of Htt in 
      neural differentiation. We found cells lacking Htt inefficient in generating 
      neural stem cells. In contrast differentiation into progenitors of mesoderm and 
      endoderm lineages was not affected. The data suggests Htt is essential for neural 
      but not cardiac/pancreatic progenitor differentiation of embryonic stem cells in 
      vitro.

AB  - Structural and functional changes attributable to the neurodegenerative process 
      in Huntington's disease (HD) may be evident in HTT CAG repeat expansion carriers 
      before the clinical manifestations of HD. It remains unclear, though, how far 
      from motor onset a consistent signature of the neurodegenerative process in HD 
      can be detected. Twelve far from onset preHD and 22 age-matched healthy control 
      participants underwent volumetric structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and resting-state functional MRI (11 preHD, 22 
      controls) as well as electrophysiological measurements (12 preHD, 13 controls). 
      There were no significant differences in white matter macro- and microstructure 
      between far from onset preHD participants and controls. Functional connectivity 
      in a basal ganglia-thalamic and motor networks, all measures of the motor 
      efferent and sensory afferent pathways as well as sensory-motor integration were 
      also similar in far from onset preHD and controls. With the methods used in far 
      from onset preHD sensory-motor neural macro- or micro-structure and brain 
      function were similar to healthy controls. This suggests that any observable 
      structural and functional change in preHD nearer to onset, or in manifest HD, at 
      least using comparable techniques such as in this study, most likely reflects an 
      ongoing neurodegenerative process.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in HTT. Here we report correction of HD human induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) using a CRISPR-Cas9 and piggyBac transposon-based 
      approach. We show that both HD and corrected isogenic hiPSCs can be 
      differentiated into excitable, synaptically active forebrain neurons. We further 
      demonstrate that phenotypic abnormalities in HD hiPSC-derived neural cells, 
      including impaired neural rosette formation, increased susceptibility to growth 
      factor withdrawal, and deficits in mitochondrial respiration, are rescued in 
      isogenic controls. Importantly, using genome-wide expression analysis, we show 
      that a number of apparent gene expression differences detected between HD and 
      non-related healthy control lines are absent between HD and corrected lines, 
      suggesting that these differences are likely related to genetic background rather 
      than HD-specific effects. Our study demonstrates correction of HD hiPSCs and 
      associated phenotypic abnormalities, and the importance of isogenic controls for 
      disease modeling using hiPSCs.

TI  - Iron accumulation and dysregulation in the putamen in fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome.
PG  - 585-591
LID - 10.1002/mds.26902 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome is an adult-onset 
      disorder associated with premutation alleles of the FMR1 gene. This disorder is 
      characterized by progressive action tremor, gait ataxia, and cognitive decline. 
      Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome pathology includes dystrophic white 
      matter and intranuclear inclusions in neurons and astrocytes. We previously 
      demonstrated that the transport of iron into the brain is altered in fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome; therefore, we also expect an alteration of 
      iron metabolism in brain areas related to motor control. Iron is essential for 
      cell metabolism, but uncomplexed iron leads to oxidative stress and contributes 
      to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated a potential 
      iron modification in the putamen - a structure that participates in motor 
      learning and performance - in fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. 
      METHODS: We used samples of putamen obtained from 9 fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome and 9 control cases to study iron localization using 
      Perl's method, and iron-binding proteins using immunostaining. RESULTS: We found 
      increased iron deposition in neuronal and glial cells in the putamen in fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. We also found a generalized decrease in the 
      amount of the iron-binding proteins transferrin and ceruloplasmin, and decreased 
      number of neurons and glial cells that contained ceruloplasmin. However, we found 
      increased levels of iron, transferrin, and ceruloplasmin in microglial cells, 
      indicating an attempt by the immune system to remove the excess iron. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Overall, found a deficit in proteins that eliminate extra iron from 
      the cells with a concomitant increase in the deposit of cellular iron in the 
      putamen in Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. (c) 2017 International

TI  - Novel allele-specific quantification methods reveal no effects of adult onset CAG 
      repeats on HTT mRNA and protein levels.
PG  - 1258-1267
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddx033 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) reflects dominant consequences of a CAG repeat 
      expansion mutation in HTT. Expanded CAG repeat size is the primary determinant of 
      age at onset and age at death in HD. Although HD pathogenesis is driven by the 
      expanded CAG repeat, whether the mutation influences the expression levels of 
      mRNA and protein from the disease allele is not clear due to the lack of 
      sensitive allele-specific quantification methods and the presence of confounding 
      factors. To determine the impact of CAG expansion at the molecular level, we have 
      developed novel allele-specific HTT mRNA and protein quantification methods based 
      on principles of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and targeted 
      MS/MS parallel reaction monitoring, respectively. These assays, exhibiting high 
      levels of specificity and sensitivity, were designed to distinguish allelic 
      products based upon expressed polymorphic variants in HTT, including 
      rs149 109 767. To control for other cis-haplotype variations, we applied 
      allele-specific quantification assays to a panel of HD lymphoblastoid cell lines, 
      each carrying the major European disease haplotype (i.e. hap.01) on the mutant 
      chromosome. We found that steady state levels of HTT mRNA and protein were not 
      associated with expanded CAG repeat length. Rather, the products of mutant and 
      normal alleles, both mRNA and protein, were balanced, thereby arguing that a 
      cis-regulatory effect of the expanded CAG repeat is not a critical component of 
      the underlying mechanism of HD. These robust allele-specific assays could prove 
      valuable for monitoring the impact of allele-specific gene silencing strategies 
      currently being explored as therapeutic interventions in HD.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene coding for the huntingtin 
      protein (HTT). Mutant HTT (mHTT) has been proposed to cause neuronal dysfunction 
      and neuronal loss through multiple mechanisms. Transcriptional changes may be a 
      core pathogenic feature of HD. Utilizing the Affymetrix platform we performed a 
      genome-wide RNA expression analysis in two BACHD transgenic rat lines (TG5 and 
      TG9) at 12 months of age, both of which carry full-length human mHTT but with 
      different expression levels. By defining the threshold of significance at 
      p < 0.01, we found 1608 genes and 871 genes differentially expressed in both TG5 
      and TG9 rats when compared to the wild type littermates, respectively. We only 
      chose the highly up-/down-regulated genes for further analysis by setting an 
      additional threshold of 1.5 fold change. Comparing gene expression profiles of 
      human HD brains and BACHD rats revealed a high concordance in both functional and 
      IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) canonical pathways relevant to HD. In addition, 
      we investigated the causes leading to gene expression changes at molecular and 
      protein levels in BACHD rats including the involvement of polyQ-containing 
      transcription factors TATA box-binding protein (TBP), Sp1 and CBP as well as the 
      chromatin structure. We demonstrate that the BACHD rat model recapitulates the 
      gene expression changes of the human disease supporting its role as a preclinical 
      research animal model. We also show for the first time that TFIID complex 
      formation is reduced, while soluble TBP is increased in an HD model. This finding 
      suggests that mHTT is a competitor instead of a recruiter of polyQ-containing 
      transcription factors in the transcription process in HD.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by CAG repeat expansion (>36 repeats) within the first exon of 
      the huntingtin gene. Although mutant huntingtin (mHTT) is ubiquitously expressed, 
      the brain shows robust and early degeneration. Current RNA interference-based 
      approaches for lowering mHTT expression have been efficacious in mouse models, 
      but basal mutant protein levels are still detected. To fully mitigate expression 
      from the mutant allele, we hypothesize that allele-specific genome editing can 
      occur via prevalent promoter-resident SNPs in heterozygosity with the mutant 
      allele. Here, we identified SNPs that either cause or destroy PAM motifs critical 
      for CRISPR-selective editing of one allele versus the other in cells from HD 
      patients and in a transgenic HD model harboring the human allele.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. HD occurs worldwide, but the 
      causative mutation is found on different HTT haplotypes in distinct ethnic 
      groups. In Latin America, HD is thought to have European origins, but indigenous 
      Amerindian ancestry has not been investigated. Here, we report dense HTT 
      haplotypes in 62 mestizo Peruvian HD families, 17 HD families from across Latin 
      America, and 42 controls of defined Peruvian Amerindian ethnicity to determine 
      the origin of HD in populations of admixed Amerindian and European descent. HD in 
      Peru occurs most frequently on the A1 HTT haplotype (73%), as in Europe, but on 
      an unexpected indigenous variant also found in Amerindian controls. This 
      Amerindian A1 HTT haplotype predominates over the European A1 variant among 
      geographically disparate Latin American controls and in HD families from across 
      Latin America, supporting an indigenous origin of the HD mutation in mestizo 
      American populations. We also show that a proportion of HD mutations in Peru 
      occur on a C1 HTT haplotype of putative Amerindian origin (14%). The majority of 
      HD mutations in Latin America may therefore occur on haplotypes of Amerindian 
      ancestry rather than on haplotypes resulting from European admixture. Despite the 
      distinct ethnic ancestry of Amerindian and European A1 HTT, alleles on the parent 
      A1 HTT haplotype allow for development of identical antisense molecules to 
      selectively silence the HD mutation in the greatest proportion of patients in 
      both Latin American and European populations.

PG  - 357-368
AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion on chromosome 4. Pathology is associated with CAG repeat 
      length. Prior studies examining people in the intermediate allele (IA) range 
      found subtle differences in motor, cognitive, and behavioral domains compared to 
      controls. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine baseline and 
      longitudinal differences in motor, cognitive, behavioral, functional, and imaging 
      outcomes between persons with CAG repeats in three ranges: normal (</=26), 
      intermediate (27-35), and reduced penetrance (36-39). METHODS: We examined 
      longitudinal data from 389 participants in three allele groups: 280 normal 
      controls (NC), 21 intermediate allele [IA], and 88 reduced penetrance [RP]. We 
      used linear mixed models to identify differences in baseline and longitudinal 
      outcomes between groups. Three models were tested: 1) no baseline or longitudinal 
      differences; 2) baseline differences but no longitudinal differences; and 3) 
      baseline and longitudinal differences. RESULTS: Model 1 was the best fitting 
      model for most outcome variables. Models 2 and 3 were best fitting for some of 
      the variables. We found baseline and longitudinal trends of declining performance 
      across increasing CAG repeat length groups, but no significant differences 
      between the NC and IA groups. CONCLUSION: We did not find evidence to support 
      differences in the IA group compared to the NC group. These findings are limited 
      by a small IA sample size.

AB  - The tri-nucleotide repeat expansion underlying Huntington disease (HD) results in 
      corticostriatal synaptic dysfunction and subsequent neurodegeneration of striatal 
      medium spiny neurons (MSNs). HD is a devastating autosomal dominant disease with 
      no disease-modifying treatments. Pridopidine, a postulated "dopamine stabilizer", 
      has been shown to improve motor symptoms in clinical trials of HD. However, the 
      target(s) and mechanism of action of pridopidine remain to be fully elucidated. 
      As binding studies identified sigma-1 receptor (S1R) as a high-affinity receptor 
      for pridopidine, we evaluated the relevance of S1R as a therapeutic target of 
      pridopidine in HD. S1R is an endoplasmic reticulum - (ER) resident transmembrane 
      protein and is regulated by ER calcium homeostasis, which is perturbed in HD. 
      Consistent with ER calcium dysregulation, we observed striatal upregulation of 
      S1R in aged YAC128 transgenic HD mice and HD patients. We previously demonstrated 
      that dendritic MSN spines are lost in aged corticostriatal co-cultures from 
      YAC128 mice. We report here that pridopidine and the chemically similar S1R 
      agonist 3-PPP prevent MSN spine loss in aging YAC128 co-cultures. Spine 
      protection was blocked by neuronal deletion of S1R. Pridopidine treatment 
      suppressed supranormal ER Ca(2+) release, restored ER calcium levels and reduced 
      excessive store-operated calcium (SOC) entry in spines, which may account for its 
      synaptoprotective effects. Normalization of ER Ca(2+) levels by pridopidine was 
      prevented by S1R deletion. To evaluate long-term effects of pridopidine, we 
      analyzed expression profiles of calcium signaling genes. Pridopidine elevated 
      striatal expression of calbindin and homer1a, whereas their striatal expression 
      was reduced in aged Q175KI and YAC128 HD mouse models compared to WT. Pridopidine 
      and 3-PPP are proposed to prevent calcium dysregulation and synaptic loss in a 
      YAC128 corticostriatal co-culture model of HD. The actions of pridopidine were 
      mediated by S1R and led to normalization of ER Ca(2+) release, ER Ca(2+) levels 
      and spine SOC entry in YAC128 MSNs. This is a new potential mechanism of action 
      for pridopidine, highlighting S1R as a potential target for HD therapy. 
      Upregulation of striatal proteins that regulate calcium, including calbindin and 
      homer1a, upon chronic therapy with pridopidine, may further contribute to 
      long-term beneficial effects of pridopidine in HD.

      trophoblast cells from the endocervical canal.
PG  - 363re4
AB  - Single-gene mutations account for more than 6000 diseases, 10% of all pediatric 
      hospital admissions, and 20% of infant deaths. Down syndrome and other 
      aneuploidies occur in more than 0.2% of births worldwide and are on the rise 
      because of advanced reproductive age. Birth defects of genetic origin can be 
      diagnosed in utero after invasive extraction of fetal tissues. Noninvasive 
      testing with circulating cell-free fetal DNA is limited by a low fetal DNA 
      fraction. Both modalities are unavailable until the end of the first trimester. 
      We have isolated intact trophoblast cells from Papanicolaou smears collected 
      noninvasively at 5 to 19 weeks of gestation for next-generation sequencing of 
      fetal DNA. Consecutive matched maternal, placental, and fetal samples (n = 20) 
      were profiled by multiplex targeted DNA sequencing of 59 short tandem repeat and 
      94 single-nucleotide variant sites across all 24 chromosomes. The data revealed 
      fetal DNA fractions of 85 to 99.9%, with 100% correct fetal haplotyping. This 
      noninvasive platform has the potential to provide comprehensive fetal genomic 
      profiling as early as 5 weeks of gestation.

      RNAs.
PG  - 226

AB  - Expansion of CAG repeats, which code for the disease-causing polyglutamine 
      protein, is a common feature in polyglutamine diseases. RNA-mediated mechanisms 
      that contribute to neuropathology in polyglutamine diseases are important. 
      RNA-toxicity describes a phenomenon by which the mutant CAG repeat RNA recruits 
      RNA-binding proteins, thereby leading to aberrant function. For example the MID1 
      protein binds to mutant huntingtin (HTT) RNA, which is linked to Huntington's 
      disease (HD), at its CAG repeat region and induces protein synthesis of mutant 
      protein. But is this mechanism specific to HD or is it a common mechanism in CAG 
      repeat expansion disorders? To answer this question, we have analyzed the 
      interaction between MID1 and three other CAG repeat mRNAs, Ataxin2 (ATXN2), 
      Ataxin3 (ATXN3), and Ataxin7 (ATXN7), that all differ in the sequence flanking 
      the CAG repeat. We show that ATXN2, ATXN3, and ATXN7 bind to MID1 in a CAG repeat 
      length-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that functionally, in line with 
      what we have previously observed for HTT, the binding of MID1 to ATXN2, ATXN3, 
      and ATXN7 mRNA induces protein synthesis in a repeat length-dependent manner. Our 
      data suggest that regulation of protein translation by the MID1 complex is a 
      common mechanism for CAG repeat containing mRNAs.

TI  - Factors related to genetic testing in adults at risk for Huntington disease: the 
      prospective Huntington at-risk observational study (PHAROS).
PG  - 824-831
LID - 10.1111/cge.12893 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a late onset ultimately fatal neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a cytosine-adenine-guanine ( CAG) triplet repeat expansion in 
      the Huntingtin gene which was discovered in 1993. The PHAROS study is a unique 
      observational study of 1001 individuals at risk for HD who had not been 
      previously tested for HD and who had no plans to do so. In this cohort, 104 (10%) 
      individuals changed their minds and chose to be tested during the course of the 
      study but outside of the study protocol. Baseline behavioral scores, especially 
      apathy, were more strongly associated with later genetic testing than motor and 
      chorea scores, particularly among subjects with expanded CAG repeat length. In 
      the CAG expanded group, those choosing to be tested were older and had more 
      chorea and higher scores on the behavioral section of the unified Huntington's 
      disease rating scale at baseline than those not choosing to be tested. Following 
      genetic testing, 56% of subjects with CAG < 37 had less depression when compared 
      to prior to testing, but depression generally stayed the same or increased for 
      64% of subjects in the expanded group. This finding suggests that approaches to 
      testing must continue to be cautious, with appropriate medical, psychological and 
      social support.

TI  - Comparative analysis of anti-polyglutamine Fab crystals grown on Earth and in 
      microgravity.
PG  - 762-771
AB  - Huntington's disease is one of nine neurodegenerative diseases caused by a 
      polyglutamine (polyQ)-repeat expansion. An anti-polyQ antigen-binding fragment, 
      MW1 Fab, was crystallized both on Earth and on the International Space Station, a 
      microgravity environment where convection is limited. Once the crystals returned 
      to Earth, the number, size and morphology of all crystals were recorded, and 
      X-ray data were collected from representative crystals. The results generally 
      agreed with previous microgravity crystallization studies. On average, 
      microgravity-grown crystals were 20% larger than control crystals grown on Earth, 
      and microgravity-grown crystals had a slightly improved mosaicity (decreased by 
      0.03 degrees ) and diffraction resolution (decreased by 0.2 A) compared with control 
      crystals grown on Earth. However, the highest resolution and lowest mosaicity 
      crystals were formed on Earth, and the highest-quality crystal overall was formed 
      on Earth after return from microgravity.

TI  - Cellular Analysis of Silencing the Huntington's Disease Gene Using AAV9 Mediated 
      Delivery of Artificial Micro RNA into the Striatum of Q140/Q140 Mice.
PG  - 239-248
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetic mutation in Huntington's disease (HD) is a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the coding region of the huntingtin (Htt) gene. RNAi strategies have 
      proven effective in substantially down-regulating Htt mRNA in the striatum 
      through delivery of siRNAs or viral vectors based on whole tissue assays, but the 
      extent of htt mRNA lowering in individual neurons is unknown. OBJECTIVE: Here we 
      characterize the effect of an AAV9-GFP-miRHtt vector on Htt mRNA levels in 
      striatal neurons of Q140/Q140 knock-in mice. METHODS: HD mice received bilateral 
      striatal injections of AAV9-GFP-miRHtt or AAV9-GFP at 6 or 12 weeks and striata 
      were evaluated at 6 months of age for levels of Htt mRNA and protein and for mRNA 
      signal within striatal neurons using RNAscope multiplex fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization. RESULTS: Compared to controls, the striatum of 6-month old mice 
      treated at 6 or 12 weeks of age with AAV9-GFP-miRHtt showed a reduction of 40-50% 
      in Htt mRNA and lowering of 25-40% in protein levels. The number of Htt mRNA foci 
      in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of untreated Q140/Q140 mice varied widely per cell 
      (0 to 34 per cell), with  approximately 10% of MSNs devoid of foci. AAV9-GFP-miRHtt treatment 
      shifted the distribution toward lower numbers and the percentage of cells without 
      foci increased to 14-20%. The average number of Htt mRNA foci per MSN was reduced 
      by 43%. CONCLUSIONS: The findings here show that intrastriatal infusion of an 
      AAV9-GFP-miRHtt vector lowers mRNA expression of Htt in striatum by  approximately 50%, through 
      a partial reduction in the number of copies of mutant Htt mRNAs per cell. These 
      findings demonstrate at the neuronal level the variable levels of Htt mRNA 
      expression in MSNs and the neuronal heterogeneity of RNAi dependent Htt mRNA 
      knockdown.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive autosomal dominant disease, caused by 
      a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene, resulting in an expanded polyglutamine 
      stretch at the N-terminal of the huntingtin protein. An important event in HD 
      pathogenesis appears to be the proteolysis of the mutant protein, which forms 
      N-terminal huntingtin fragments. These fragments form insoluble aggregates and 
      are found in nuclei and cytoplasm of affected neurons where they interfere with 
      normal cell functioning. Important cleavage sites are encoded by exon 12 of HTT. 
      A novel approach is Htt protein modification through exon skipping, which has 
      recently been proven effective both in vitro and in vivo. Here we report 
      proof-of-concept of AON 12.1 in vivo using the YAC128 mouse model of HD. Our 
      results support and encourage future longitudinal studies exploring the 
      therapeutic effects of sustained infusions in the YAC128 mouse model.

TI  - A C9ORF72/SMCR8-containing complex regulates ULK1 and plays a dual role in 
      autophagy.

AB  - The intronic GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion in chromosome 9 open reading 
      frame 72 (C9ORF72) is a prevalent genetic abnormality identified in both 
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 
      Smith-Magenis syndrome chromosomal region candidate gene 8 (SMCR8) is a protein 
      with unclear functions. We report that C9ORF72 is a component of a multiprotein 
      complex containing SMCR8, WDR41, and ATG101 (an important regulator of 
      autophagy). The C9ORF72 complex displays guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) 
      activity and acts as a guanosine diphosphate-guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GDP-GTP) 
      exchange factor (GEF) for RAB39B. We created Smcr8 knockout mice and found that 
      Smcr8 mutant cells exhibit impaired autophagy induction, which is similarly 
      observed in C9orf72 knockdown cells. Mechanistically, SMCR8/C9ORF72 interacts 
      with the key autophagy initiation ULK1 complex and regulates expression and 
      activity of ULK1. The complex has an additional role in regulating later stages 
      of autophagy. Whereas autophagic flux is enhanced in C9orf72 knockdown cells, 
      depletion of Smcr8 results in a reduced flux with an abnormal expression of 
      lysosomal enzymes. Thus, C9ORF72 and SMCR8 have similar functions in modulating 
      autophagy induction by regulating ULK1 and play distinct roles in regulating 
      autophagic flux.

      Kynurenine Pathway Activation, Altered CD8+ T-Cell Responses, and Premature 
      Mortality.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      polyglutamine-repeat expansion in the huntingtin protein. Activation of the 
      kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation is implicated in the pathogenesis of 
      HD. Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) catalyzes the oxidation of tryptophan to 
      kynurenine, the first step in this pathway. The prevalent, neuroinvasive 
      protozoal pathogen Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) results in clinically silent 
      life-long infection in immune-competent individuals. T. gondii infection results 
      in activation of IDO which provides some protection against the parasite by 
      depleting tryptophan which the parasite cannot synthesize. The kynurenine pathway 
      may therefore represent a point of synergism between HD and T. gondii infection. 
      We show here that IDO activity is elevated at least four-fold in frontal cortex 
      and striata of non-infected N171-82Q HD mice at 14-weeks corresponding to 
      early-advanced HD. T. gondii infection at 5 weeks resulted in elevation of 
      cortical IDO activity in HD mice. HD-infected mice died significantly earlier 
      than wild-type infected and HD control mice. Prior to death, infected HD mice 
      demonstrated decreased CD8+ T-lymphocyte proliferation in brain and spleen 
      compared to wild-type infected mice. We demonstrate for the first time that HD 
      mice have an altered response to an infectious agent that is characterized by 
      premature mortality, altered immune responses and early activation of IDO. 
      Findings are relevant to understanding how T. gondii infection may interact with 
      pathways mediating neurodegeneration in HD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by CAG repeat expansions in the HTT gene. Somatic repeat expansion in the 
      R6/1 mouse model of HD depends on mismatch repair and is worsened by base 
      excision repair initiated by the 7,8-dihydroxy-8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase 
      (Ogg1) or Nei-like 1 (Neil1). Ogg1 and Neil1 repairs common oxidative lesions. 
      METHODS: We investigated whether anthocyanin antioxidants added daily to the 
      drinking water could affect CAG repeat instability in several organs and 
      behaviour in R6/1 HD mice. In addition, anthocyanin-treated and untreated R6/1 HD 
      mice at 22 weeks of age were tested in the open field test and on the rotarod. 
      RESULTS: Anthocyanin-treated R6/1 HD mice showed reduced instability index in the 
      ears and in the cortex compared to untreated R6/1 mice, and no difference in 
      liver and kidney. There were no significant differences in any of the parameters 
      tested in the behavioural tests among anthocyanin-treated and untreated R6/1 HD 
      mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that continuous anthocyanin-treatment may 
      have modest effects on CAG repeat instability in the ears and the cortex of R6/1 
      mice. More studies are required to investigate if anthocyanin-treatment could 
      affect behaviour earlier in the disease course.

AB  - We present a novel, general class of disease progression models for Huntington's 
      disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disease caused by a cytosine-adenine-guanine 
      (CAG) triplet repeat expansion on the huntingtin gene. Models are fit to a 
      selection of structural imaging markers from the TRACK 36-month database. The 
      models are of mixed effects type and should be useful in predicting any 
      continuous marker of HD state as a function of age and CAG length (the genetic 
      factor that drives HD pathology). The effects of age and CAG length are modeled 
      using flexible regression splines. Variability not accounted for by age, CAG 
      length, or covariates is modeled using terms that represent measurement error, 
      population variability (random slopes/intercepts), and variability due to the 
      dynamics of the disease process (random walk terms). A Kalman filter is used to 
      estimate variances of the random walk terms.

TI  - Natural variation in sensory-motor white matter organization influences 
      manifestations of Huntington's disease.
PG  - 4615-4628
LID - 10.1002/hbm.23332 [doi]
AB  - While the HTT CAG-repeat expansion mutation causing Huntington's disease (HD) is 
      highly correlated with the rate of pathogenesis leading to disease onset, 
      considerable variance in age-at-onset remains unexplained. Therefore, other 
      factors must influence the pathogenic process. We asked whether these factors 
      were related to natural biological variation in the sensory-motor system. In 243 
      participants (96 premanifest and 35 manifest HD; 112 controls), sensory-motor 
      structural MRI, tractography, resting-state fMRI, electrophysiology (including 
      SEP amplitudes), motor score ratings, and grip force as sensory-motor performance 
      were measured. Following individual modality analyses, we used principal 
      component analysis (PCA) to identify patterns associated with sensory-motor 
      performance, and manifest versus premanifest HD discrimination. We did not detect 
      longitudinal differences over 12 months. PCA showed a pattern of loss of caudate, 
      grey and white matter volume, cortical thickness in premotor and sensory cortex, 
      and disturbed diffusivity in sensory-motor white matter tracts that was connected 
      to CAG repeat length. Two further major principal components appeared in controls 
      and HD individuals indicating that they represent natural biological variation 
      unconnected to the HD mutation. One of these components did not influence HD 
      while the other non-CAG-driven component of axial versus radial diffusivity 
      contrast in white matter tracts were associated with sensory-motor performance 
      and manifest HD. The first component reflects the expected CAG expansion effects 
      on HD pathogenesis. One non-CAG-driven component reveals an independent influence 
      on pathogenesis of biological variation in white matter tracts and merits further 
      investigation to delineate the underlying mechanism and the potential it offers 
      for disease modification. Hum Brain Mapp 37:4615-4628, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley

      Expansion in Friedreich's Ataxia Cells.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is caused by the expansion of GAA repeats located in 
      the Frataxin (FXN) gene. The GAA repeats continue to expand in FRDA patients, 
      aggravating symptoms and contributing to disease progression. The mechanism 
      leading to repeat expansion and decreased FXN transcription remains unclear. 
      Using single-molecule analysis of replicated DNA, we detected that expanded GAA 
      repeats present a substantial obstacle for the replication machinery at the FXN 
      locus in FRDA cells. Furthermore, aberrant origin activation and lack of a proper 
      stress response to rescue the stalled forks in FRDA cells cause an increase in 
      3'-5' progressing forks, which could enhance repeat expansion and hinder FXN 
      transcription by head-on collision with RNA polymerases. Treatment of FRDA cells 
      with GAA-specific polyamides rescues DNA replication fork stalling and alleviates 
      expansion of the GAA repeats, implicating DNA triplexes as a replication 
      impediment and suggesting that fork stalling might be a therapeutic target for 
      FRDA.

      Clinical and Genetic Approach.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Huntington disease (HD), a prototypic monogenic disease, is caused by 
      an expanded CAG repeat in the HTT gene exceeding 35 units. However, not all 
      patients with an HD phenotype carry the pathological expansion in HTT, and the 
      positive diagnosis rate is poor. OBJECTIVES: To examine patients with HD 
      phenotypes to determine the frequency of HD phenocopies with typical features of 
      HD but without pathological CAG repeat expansions in HTT in an attempt to improve 
      the positive diagnosis rate. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between January 
      1, 2004, and April 18, 2011, a total of 226 consecutive index patients with an HD 
      phenotype were referred to specialized clinics of the French National Huntington 
      Disease Reference Centre for Rare Diseases. They underwent detailed clinical 
      examination and follow-up, as well as neuropsychological, biological, imaging, 
      and genetic examinations. Nucleotide expansions in JPH3, ATN1, TBP, and C9ORF72 
      and mutations in PRNP, as well as acquired conditions commonly causing HD 
      phenocopies, were first screened. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The diagnostic rate 
      of HD phenocopies and frequency of other etiologies using deep clinical 
      phenotyping and next generation sequencing. Our goal was to improve the genetic 
      diagnosis of HD phenocopies and to identify new HD related genes. RESULTS: One 
      hundred ninety-eight patients carried a pathological CAG repeat expansion in HTT, 
      whereas 28 patients (12 women and 16 men) did not. Huntington disease phenocopies 
      accounted for 12.4%, and their mean (SD) age at onset was similar to those of the 
      HD-HTT group (47.3 [12.7] years vs 50.3 [16.4] years, P = .29). We first 
      identified 3 patients with abnormal CTG expansions in JPH3, a fourth patient with 
      an antiphospholipid syndrome, and a fifth patient with B12 avitaminosis. A 
      custom-made 63-gene panel was generated based on clinical evolution and exome 
      sequencing. It contained genes responsible for HD phenocopies and other 
      neurodegenerative conditions, as well as candidate genes from exome sequencing in 
      3 index cases with imaging features of brain iron accumulation. We identified 
      mutations in genes associated with neurodegeneration, including CACNA1A (n = 2), 
      VPS13A (n = 1), UBQLN2 (n = 1), and VCP (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Huntington disease phenocopies without CAG repeat expansions in HTT are not rare, 
      occurring in 12.4% (28 of 226) herein, and should be considered in genetic 
      counseling. We used next-generation sequencing combined with clinical data and 
      disease evolution to explore multiple etiologies simultaneously. Our combined 
      clinical and genetic exploration of 28 HD phenocopies identified the underlying 
      cause in 35.7% (10 of 28). In conclusion, the etiologies of HD phenocopies are 
      heterogeneous, and clinical evolution should be taken into account when searching 
      for a genetic cause. The panel of candidate genes to be examined is larger than 
      expected but can be guided by specific imaging and clinical features. Other 
      neurodegenerative diseases with late onset in which variant segregation cannot be 
      verified could be productively explored with the combined approach illustrated 
      herein.

TI  - A Novel Protocol for Directed Differentiation of C9orf72-Associated Human Induced 
      Pluripotent Stem Cells Into Contractile Skeletal Myotubes.
PG  - 1461-1472
LID - 10.5966/sctm.2015-0340 [doi]
AB  - : Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer an unlimited resource of cells to 
      be used for the study of underlying molecular biology of disease, therapeutic 
      drug screening, and transplant-based regenerative medicine. However, methods for 
      the directed differentiation of skeletal muscle for these purposes remain scarce 
      and incomplete. Here, we present a novel, small molecule-based protocol for the 
      generation of multinucleated skeletal myotubes using eight independent iPSC 
      lines. Through combinatorial inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and 
      glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) with addition of bone morphogenic protein 4 
      (BMP4) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), we report up to 64% conversion of 
      iPSCs into the myogenic program by day 36 as indicated by MYOG(+) cell 
      populations. These cells began to exhibit spontaneous contractions as early as 34 
      days in vitro in the presence of a serum-free medium formulation. We used this 
      protocol to obtain iPSC-derived muscle cells from frontotemporal dementia (FTD) 
      patients harboring C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions (rGGGGCC), sporadic 
      FTD, and unaffected controls. iPSCs derived from rGGGGCC carriers contained RNA 
      foci but did not vary in differentiation efficiency when compared to unaffected 
      controls nor display mislocalized TDP-43 after as many as 120 days in vitro. This 
      study presents a rapid, efficient, and transgene-free method for generating 
      multinucleated skeletal myotubes from iPSCs and a resource for further modeling 
      the role of skeletal muscle in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other motor 
      neuron diseases. SIGNIFICANCE: Protocols to produce skeletal myotubes for disease 
      modeling or therapy are scarce and incomplete. The present study efficiently 
      generates functional skeletal myotubes from human induced pluripotent stem cells 
      using a small molecule-based approach. Using this strategy, terminal myogenic 
      induction of up to 64% in 36 days and spontaneously contractile myotubes within 
      34 days were achieved. Myotubes derived from patients carrying the C9orf72 repeat 
      expansion show no change in differentiation efficiency and normal TDP-43 
      localization after as many as 120 days in vitro when compared to unaffected 
      controls. This study provides an efficient, novel protocol for the generation of 
      skeletal myotubes from human induced pluripotent stem cells that may serve as a 
      valuable tool in drug discovery and modeling of musculoskeletal and neuromuscular 
      diseases.

TI  - Warburg effect linked to cognitive-executive deficits in FMR1 premutation.
PG  - 3334-3351
AB  - A 55-200 CGG repeat expansion in the 5'-UTR of the fragile X mental retardation 1 
      (FMR1) gene is known as a premutation. Some carriers are affected by the 
      neurodegenerative disorder fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), 
      primary ovarian insufficiency, and neurobehavioral impairments. Based on the 
      mitochondrial dysfunction observed in fibroblasts and brain samples from 
      carriers, as well as in neurons and brains from a mouse model of the premutation, 
      we evaluated the presence of the Warburg effect in peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells (PBMCs) from 30 premutation carriers with either a rebalance of the 
      metabolism [increasing glycolysis while decreasing oxidative phosphorylation 
      (oxphos)] or a metabolic amplification (increasing glycolysis while 
      maintaining/increasing oxphos). Deficits in oxphos-more pronounced in 
      FXTAS-affected subjects-were accompanied by a shift toward glycolysis, suggesting 
      increased glycolysis despite aerobic conditions. Differential proteomics extended 
      these findings, unveiling a decreased antioxidant response, translation, and 
      disrupted extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton organization with activation of 
      prosenescence pathways. Lower bioenergetics segregated with increased incidence 
      of low executive function, tremors, below-average IQ, and FXTAS. The combination 
      of functional and proteomic data unveiled new mechanisms related to energy 
      production in the premutation, showing the potential of being applicable to other 
      psychiatric disorders to identify endophenotype-specific responses relevant to 
      neurobiology.-Napoli, E., Song, G., Schneider, A., Hagerman, R., Eldeeb, M. A. A.

TI  - Identification of Novel Microsatellite Markers <1 Mb from the HTT CAG Repeat and 
      Development of a Single-Tube Tridecaplex PCR Panel of Highly Polymorphic Markers 
      for Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis of Huntington Disease.
PG  - 1096-105
LID - 10.1373/clinchem.2016.255711 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of Huntington disease (HD) 
      generally employs linkage analysis of flanking microsatellite markers to 
      complement direct mutation testing, as well as for exclusion testing. Thus far, 
      only 10 linked markers have been developed for use in HD PGD, with a maximum of 3 
      markers coamplified successfully. We aimed to develop a single-tube multiplex PCR 
      panel of highly polymorphic markers to simplify HD PGD. METHODS: An in silico 
      search was performed to identify all markers within 1 Mb flanking the huntingtin 
      (HTT) gene. Selected markers were optimized in a single-tube PCR panel, and their 
      polymorphism indices were determined in 2 populations. The panel was tested on 63 
      single cells to validate its utility in PGD. RESULTS: We identified 102 markers 
      in silico, of which 56 satisfied the selection criteria. After initial testing, 
      12 markers with potentially high heterozygosity were optimized into a single-tube 
      PCR panel together with a 13th more distally located marker. Analysis of DNA from 
      183 Chinese and Caucasian individuals revealed high polymorphism indices for all 
      markers (polymorphism information content >0.5), with observed heterozygosities 
      ranging from 0.5-0.92. All individuals were heterozygous for at least 5 markers, 
      with 99.5% of individuals heterozygous for at least 2 markers upstream and 
      downstream of the HTT CAG repeat. CONCLUSIONS: The tridecaplex marker assay 
      amplified reliably from single cells either directly or after whole genome 
      amplification, thus validating its standalone use in HD exclusion PGD or as a 
      complement to HTT CAG repeat expansion-mutation detection.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized 
      by motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. Atrophy of the striatum has been 
      proposed for several years as a biomarker to assess disease progression in HD 
      gene carriers. However, it does not provide any information about the biological 
      mechanisms linked to HD pathogenesis. Changes in brain metabolites have been also 
      consistently seen in HD patients and animal models using Magnetic Resonance 
      Spectroscopy (MRS), but metabolite measurements are generally limited to a single 
      voxel. In this study, we used Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer imaging of 
      glutamate (gluCEST) in order to map glutamate distribution in the brain of a 
      knock-in mouse model (Ki140CAG) with a precise anatomical resolution. We 
      demonstrated that both heterozygous and homozygous mice with pathological CAG 
      repeat expansion in gene encoding huntingtin exhibited an atrophy of the striatum 
      and a significant alteration of their metabolic profile in the striatum as 
      compared to wild type littermate controls. The striatal decrease was then 
      confirmed by gluCEST imaging. Surprisingly, CEST imaging also revealed that the 
      corpus callosum was the most affected structure in both genotype groups, 
      suggesting that this structure could be highly vulnerable in HD. We evaluated for 
      the first time gluCEST imaging as a potential biomarker of HD and demonstrated 
      its potential for characterizing metabolic defects in neurodegenerative diseases 
      in specific regions.

AB  - Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2) and Huntington disease (HD) are adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative diseases characterized by movement disorders, psychiatric 
      disturbances and cognitive decline. Brain tissue from HD and HDL2 patients shows 
      degeneration of the striatum and ubiquitinated inclusions immunoreactive for 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) antibodies. Despite these similarities, the diseases result 
      from different genetic mutations. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the 
      huntingtin (HTT) gene, while HDL2 results from an expansion at the junctophilin 3 
      (JPH3) locus. Recent evidence indicates that the HDL2 expansion may give rise to 
      a toxic polyQ protein translated from an antisense mRNA derived from the JPH3 
      locus. To investigate this hypothesis, we generated and characterized a 
      Drosophila HDL2 model and compared it with a previously established HD model. We 
      find that neuronal expression of HDL2-Q15 is not toxic, while the expression of 
      an expanded HDL2-Q138 protein is lethal. HDL2-Q138 forms large nuclear 
      aggregates, with only smaller puncta observed in the cytoplasm. This is in 
      contrast to what is observed in a Drosophila model of HD, where polyQ aggregates 
      localize exclusively to the cytoplasm. Altering localization of HLD2 with the 
      addition of a nuclear localization or nuclear export sequence demonstrates that 
      nuclear accumulation is required for toxicity in the Drosophila HDL2 model. 
      Directing HDL2-Q138 to the nucleus exacerbates toxicity in multiple tissue types, 
      while confining HDL2-Q138 to the cytoplasm restores viability to control levels. 
      We conclude that while HD and HDL2 have similar clinical profiles, distinct 
      pathogenic mechanisms are likely to drive toxicity in Drosophila models of these 
      disorders.

AB  - The human genetic disorders caused by CAG repeat expansions in the translated 
      sequences of various genes are called polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases because of 
      the cellular "toxicity" of the mutant proteins. The contribution of mutant 
      transcripts to the pathogenesis of these diseases is supported by several 
      observations obtained from cellular models of these disorders. Here, we show that 
      the common feature of cell lines modeling polyQ diseases is the formation of 
      nuclear CAG RNA foci. We performed qualitative and quantitative analyses of these 
      foci in numerous cellular models endogenously and exogenously expressing mutant 
      transcripts by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We compared the CAG RNA 
      foci of polyQ diseases with the CUG foci of myotonic dystrophy type 1 and found 
      substantial differences in their number and morphology. Smaller differences 
      within the polyQ disease group were also revealed and included a positive 
      correlation between the foci number and the CAG repeat length. We show that 
      expanded CAA repeats, also encoding glutamine, did not trigger RNA foci formation 
      and foci formation is independent of the presence of mutant polyglutamine 
      protein. Using FISH combined with immunofluorescence, we demonstrated partial 
      co-localization of CAG repeat foci with MBNL1 alternative splicing factor, which 
      explains the mild deregulation of MBNL1-dependent genes. We also showed that foci 
      reside within nuclear speckles in diverse cell types: fibroblasts, lymphoblasts, 
      iPS cells and neuronal progenitors and remain dependent on integrity of these 
      nuclear structures.

TI  - Altered Expression of the Long Noncoding RNA NEAT1 in Huntington's Disease.
PG  - 1577-1586
LID - 10.1007/s12035-016-9928-9 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease caused by 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. 
      Growing evidence supports the regulatory functions of long noncoding RNAs 
      (lncRNAs) in the disease process, but little is known about the association 
      between lncRNAs and neuronal death in HD. Here, we evaluated the altered 
      expression profiles of lncRNA in HD by using microarrays. Among dysregulated 
      lncRNAs, we focused on the upregulation of nuclear paraspeckle assembly 
      transcript 1 (NEAT1). Quantitative PCR analysis validated increased NEAT1 levels 
      in the R6/2 mouse brain as well as the human HD postmortem brain. To determine 
      the biological effects of NEAT1 on neuronal survival, neuro2A cells were 
      transfected with the NEAT1 short isoform vector and were subjected to 
      H(2)O(2)-induced injury. Subsequently, NEAT1-transfected cells showed increased 
      viability under oxidative stress. Our observations support the notion that NEAT1 
      upregulation in HD contributes to the neuroprotective mechanism against neuronal 
      injury rather than the pathological process underlying neurodegeneration in HD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate determination of the CAG repeat number is crucial for 
      diagnostic and predictive testing for Huntington disease (HD). Current PCR-based 
      assays can accurately size up to  approximately 110 HTT CAG repeats. OBJECTIVE: To develop an 
      improved assay capable of detecting larger CAG repeat expansions. METHODS: A 
      triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) assay was optimized and validated on 14 HD reference 
      DNAs, including a sample carrying a large expansion of  approximately 180 CAG repeats. RESULTS: 
      All 14 HD reference samples showed 100% concordance with the previously verified 
      allele sizes. For alleles under 45 CAGs, identical repeat sizes were obtained, 
      while alleles larger than 46 CAGs were sized to within +/-1 CAG. The improved 
      TP-PCR assay successfully detected the  approximately 180 CAG repeat allele in an affected 
      sample. CONCLUSION: This method extends the detection limit of large expanded 
      alleles to at least  approximately 175-180 CAG repeats, thus reducing the likelihood of 
      requiring Southern blot analysis for any HD-affected sample.

TI  - DNA Methylation Leads to DNA Repair Gene Down-Regulation and Trinucleotide Repeat 
      Expansion in Patient-Derived Huntington Disease Cells.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease that 
      exhibits genetic anticipation of affected progeny due to expansions of a 
      trinucleotide repeat (TNR) region within the HTT gene. DNA repair machinery is a 
      known effector of TNR instability; however, the specific defects in HD cells that 
      lead to TNR expansion are unknown. We hypothesized that HD cells would be 
      deficient in DNA repair gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 
      expression of select DNA repair genes involved in mismatch/loop-out repair 
      (APEX1, BRCA1, RPA1, and RPA3) in patient-derived HD cells and found each was 
      consistently down-regulated relative to wild-type samples taken from unaffected 
      individuals in the same family. Rescue of DNA repair gene expression by 
      5-azacytidine treatment identified DNA methylation as a mediator of DNA repair 
      gene expression deficiency. Bisulfite sequencing confirmed hypermethylation of 
      the APEX1 promoter region in HD cells relative to control, as well as 
      5-azacytidine-induced hypomethylation. 5-Azacytidine treatments also resulted in 
      stabilization of TNR expansion within the mutant HTT allele during long-term 
      culture of HD cells. Our findings indicate that DNA methylation leads to DNA 
      repair down-regulation and TNR instability in mitotically active HD cells and 
      offer a proof of principle that epigenetic interventions can curb TNR expansions.

TI  - RNA-Seq of Huntington's disease patient myeloid cells reveals innate 
      transcriptional dysregulation associated with proinflammatory pathway activation.
PG  - 2893-2904
AB  - Innate immune activation beyond the central nervous system is emerging as a vital 
      component of the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. Huntington's disease (HD) is 
      a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the 
      huntingtin gene. The systemic innate immune system is thought to act as a 
      modifier of disease progression; however, the molecular mechanisms remain only 
      partially understood. Here we use RNA-sequencing to perform whole transcriptome 
      analysis of primary monocytes from thirty manifest HD patients and thirty-three 
      control subjects, cultured with and without a proinflammatory stimulus. In 
      contrast with previous studies that have required stimulation to elicit 
      phenotypic abnormalities, we demonstrate significant transcriptional differences 
      in HD monocytes in their basal, unstimulated state. This includes previously 
      undetected increased resting expression of genes encoding numerous 
      proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL6 Further pathway analysis revealed 
      widespread resting enrichment of proinflammatory functional gene sets, while 
      upstream regulator analysis coupled with Western blotting suggests that abnormal 
      basal activation of the NFkB pathway plays a key role in mediating these 
      transcriptional changes. That HD myeloid cells have a proinflammatory phenotype 
      in the absence of stimulation is consistent with a priming effect of mutant 
      huntingtin, whereby basal dysfunction leads to an exaggerated inflammatory 
      response once a stimulus is encountered. These data advance our understanding of 
      mutant huntingtin pathogenesis, establish resting myeloid cells as a key source 
      of HD immune dysfunction, and further demonstrate the importance of systemic 
      immunity in the potential treatment of HD and the wider study of 
      neurodegeneration.

      disease.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG 
      repeat expansions in the huntingtin gene. Although, stem cell-based therapy has 
      emerged as a potential treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, limitations 
      remain, including optimizing delivery to the brain and donor cell loss after 
      transplantation. One strategy to boost cell survival and efficacy is to 
      precondition cells before transplantation. Because the neuroprotective actions of 
      the mood stabilizers lithium and valproic acid (VPA) induce multiple pro-survival 
      signaling pathways, we hypothesized that preconditioning bone marrow-derived 
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with lithium and VPA prior to intranasal delivery 
      to the brain would enhance their therapeutic efficacy, and thereby facilitate 
      functional recovery in N171-82Q HD transgenic mice. MSCs were treated in the 
      presence or absence of combined lithium and VPA, and were then delivered by 
      brain-targeted single intranasal administration to eight-week old HD mice. 
      Histological analysis confirmed the presence of MSCs in the brain. Open-field 
      test revealed that ambulatory distance and mean velocity were significantly 
      improved in HD mice that received preconditioned MSCs, compared to HD 
      vehicle-control and HD mice transplanted with non-preconditioned MSCs. Greater 
      benefits on motor function were observed in HD mice given preconditioned MSCs, 
      while HD mice treated with non-preconditioned MSCs showed no functional benefits. 
      Moreover, preconditioned MSCs reduced striatal neuronal loss and huntingtin 
      aggregates in HD mice. Gene expression profiling of preconditioned MSCs revealed 
      a robust increase in expression of genes involved in trophic effects, 
      antioxidant, anti-apoptosis, cytokine/chemokine receptor, migration, 
      mitochondrial energy metabolism, and stress response signaling pathways. 
      Consistent with this finding, preconditioned MSCs demonstrated increased survival 
      after transplantation into the brain compared to non-preconditioned cells. Our 
      results suggest that preconditioning stem cells with the mood stabilizers lithium 
      and VPA before transplantation may serve as an effective strategy for enhancing 
      the therapeutic efficacy of stem cell-based therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable hereditary 
      neurodegenerative disorder, which manifests itself as a loss of GABAergic medium 
      spiny (GABA MS) neurons in the striatum and caused by an expansion of the CAG 
      repeat in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene. There is no cure for HD, existing 
      pharmaceutical can only relieve its symptoms. RESULTS: Here, induced pluripotent 
      stem cells were established from patients with low CAG repeat expansion in the 
      huntingtin gene, and were then efficiently differentiated into GABA MS-like 
      neurons (GMSLNs) under defined culture conditions. The generated HD GMSLNs 
      recapitulated disease pathology in vitro, as evidenced by mutant huntingtin 
      protein aggregation, increased number of lysosomes/autophagosomes, nuclear 
      indentations, and enhanced neuronal death during cell aging. Moreover, 
      store-operated channel (SOC) currents were detected in the differentiated 
      neurons, and enhanced calcium entry was reproducibly demonstrated in all HD 
      GMSLNs genotypes. Additionally, the quinazoline derivative, EVP4593, reduced the 
      number of lysosomes/autophagosomes and SOC currents in HD GMSLNs and exerted 
      neuroprotective effects during cell aging. CONCLUSIONS: Our data is the first to 
      demonstrate the direct link of nuclear morphology and SOC calcium deregulation to 
      mutant huntingtin protein expression in iPSCs-derived neurons with 
      disease-mimetic hallmarks, providing a valuable tool for identification of 
      candidate anti-HD drugs. Our experiments demonstrated that EVP4593 may be a 
      promising anti-HD drug.

TI  - Clinical and genetic data of Huntington disease in Moroccan patients.
PG  - 1232-8
LID - 10.4314/ahs.v15i4.23 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) occurs worldwide with prevalence varying 
      from 0.1 to 10/100,000 depending of the ethnic origin. Since no data is available 
      in the Maghreb population, the aim of this study is to describe clinical and 
      genetic characteristics of Huntington patients of Moroccan origin. METHODS: 
      Clinical and genetics data of 21 consecutive patients recruited from 2009 to 2014 
      from the outpatient clinic of six medical centers were analyzed. Statistical 
      analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Twenty one patients 
      from 17 families were diagnosed positive for the IT15 gene CAG expansion. 
      Clinical symptoms were predominantly motor (19/21). Twelve patients had 
      psychiatric and behavioral disorders, and 11 patients had cognitive disorders 
      essentially of memory impairment. Analysis of genetic results showed that 5 
      patients had reduced penetrant (RP) alleles and 16 had fully penetrant (FP) 
      alleles. The mean CAG repeat length in patients with RP alleles was 38.4 +/- 0.54, 
      and 45.37 +/- 8.30 in FP alleles. The age of onset and the size of the CAG repeat 
      length showed significant inverse correlation (p <0.001, r = -0.754). CONCLUSION: 
      Clinical and genetic data of Moroccan patients are similar to those of Caucasian 
      populations previously reported in the literature.

      model.
PG  - 20681

LID - 20681
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited, progressive 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion within exon 1 of HTT, 
      encoding huntingtin. There are no therapies that can delay the progression of 
      this devastating disease. One feature of HD that may play a critical role in its 
      pathogenesis is metabolic disruption. Consequently, we undertook a comparative 
      study of metabolites in our transgenic sheep model of HD (OVT73). This model does 
      not display overt symptoms of HD but has circadian rhythm alterations and 
      molecular changes characteristic of the early phase disease. Quantitative 
      metabolite profiles were generated from the motor cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum 
      and liver tissue of 5 year old transgenic sheep and matched controls by gas 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry. Differentially abundant metabolites were 
      evident in the cerebellum and liver. There was striking tissue-specificity, with 
      predominantly amino acids affected in the transgenic cerebellum and fatty acids 
      in the transgenic liver, which together may indicate a hyper-metabolic state. 
      Furthermore, there were more strong pair-wise correlations of metabolite 
      abundance in transgenic than in wild-type cerebellum and liver, suggesting 
      altered metabolic constraints. Together these differences indicate a metabolic 
      disruption in the sheep model of HD and could provide insight into the 
      presymptomatic human disease.

TI  - Maternal T-Cell Engraftment Interferes With Human Leukocyte Antigen Typing in 
      Severe Combined Immunodeficiency.
PG  - 251-7
LID - 10.1093/ajcp/aqv079 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To report the laboratory investigation of a case of severe combined 
      immunodeficiency (SCID) with maternal T-cell engraftment, focusing on the 
      interference of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing by blood chimerism. METHODS: 
      HLA typing was performed with three different methods, including 
      sequence-specific primer (SSP), sequence-specific oligonucleotide, and Sanger 
      sequencing on peripheral blood leukocytes and buccal cells, from a 3-month-old 
      boy and peripheral blood leukocytes from his parents. Short tandem repeat (STR) 
      testing was performed in parallel. RESULTS: HLA typing of the patient's 
      peripheral blood leukocytes using the SSP method demonstrated three different 
      alleles for each of the HLA-B and HLA-C loci, with both maternal alleles present 
      at each locus. Typing results from the patient's buccal cells showed a normal 
      pattern of inheritance for paternal and maternal haplotypes. STR enrichment 
      testing of the patient's CD3+ T lymphocytes and CD15+ myeloid cells confirmed 
      maternal T-cell engraftment, while the myeloid cell profile matched the patient's 
      buccal cells. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal T-cell engraftment may interfere with HLA 
      typing in patients with SCID. Selection of the appropriate typing methods and 
      specimens is critical for accurate HLA typing and immunologic assessment before 
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

PG  - 501-7
LID - 10.1586/14737159.2016.1135739 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Almost all patients with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) exhibit a CGG repeat 
      expansion (full mutation) in the Fragile Mental Retardation 1 gene (FMR1). Here, 
      the authors report five unrelated males with FXS harboring a somatic full 
      mutation/deletion mosaicism. METHODS: Mutational profiles were only elucidated by 
      using a combination of molecular approaches (CGG-based PCR, Sanger sequencing, 
      MS-MLPA, Southern blot and mPCR). RESULTS: Four patients exhibited small 
      deletions encompassing the CGG repeats tract and flanking regions, whereas the 
      remaining had a larger deletion comprising at least exon 1 and part of intron 1 
      of FMR1 gene. The presence of a 2-3 base pairs microhomology in proximal and 
      distal non-recurrent breakpoints without scars supports the involvement of 
      microhomology mediated induced repair (MMBIR) mechanism in three small deletions. 
      CONCLUSION: The authors data highlights the importance of using different 
      research methods to elucidate atypical FXS mutational profiles, which are 
      clinically undistinguishable and may have been underestimated.

TI  - Genomic Analysis Reveals Disruption of Striatal Neuronal Development and

AB  - We utilized induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from Huntington's 
      disease (HD) patients as a human model of HD and determined that the disease 
      phenotypes only manifest in the differentiated neural stem cell (NSC) stage, not 
      in iPSCs. To understand the molecular basis for the CAG repeat 
      expansion-dependent disease phenotypes in NSCs, we performed transcriptomic 
      analysis of HD iPSCs and HD NSCs compared to isogenic controls. Differential gene 
      expression and pathway analysis pointed to transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) 
      and netrin-1 as the top dysregulated pathways. Using data-driven gene 
      coexpression network analysis, we identified seven distinct coexpression modules 
      and focused on two that were correlated with changes in gene expression due to 
      the CAG expansion. Our HD NSC model revealed the dysregulation of genes involved 
      in neuronal development and the formation of the dorsal striatum. The striatal 
      and neuronal networks disrupted could be modulated to correct HD phenotypes and 
      provide therapeutic targets.

TI  - PPAR-delta is repressed in Huntington's disease, is required for normal neuronal 
      function and can be targeted therapeutically.
PG  - 37-45
LID - 10.1038/nm.4003 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which encodes a 
      polyglutamine tract in the HTT protein. We found that peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR-delta) interacts with HTT and that mutant 
      HTT represses PPAR-delta-mediated transactivation. Increased PPAR-delta transactivation 
      ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction and improved cell survival of neurons from 
      mouse models of HD. Expression of dominant-negative PPAR-delta in the central nervous 
      system of mice was sufficient to induce motor dysfunction, neurodegeneration, 
      mitochondrial abnormalities and transcriptional alterations that recapitulated 
      HD-like phenotypes. Expression of dominant-negative PPAR-delta specifically in the 
      striatum of medium spiny neurons in mice yielded HD-like motor phenotypes, 
      accompanied by striatal neuron loss. In mouse models of HD, pharmacologic 
      activation of PPAR-delta using the agonist KD3010 improved motor function, reduced 
      neurodegeneration and increased survival. PPAR-delta activation also reduced 
      HTT-induced neurotoxicity in vitro and in medium spiny-like neurons generated 
      from stem cells derived from individuals with HD, indicating that PPAR-delta 
      activation may be beneficial in HD and related disorders.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG repeat 
      expansion in the gene encoding huntingtin, predominantly affects the striatum, 
      especially the spiny projection neurons (SPN). The striatum receives excitatory 
      input from cortex and thalamus, and the role of the former has been well-studied 
      in HD. Here, we report that mutated huntingtin alters function of thalamostriatal 
      connections. We used a novel thalamostriatal (T-S) coculture and an established 
      corticostriatal (C-S) coculture, generated from YAC128 HD and WT (FVB/NJ 
      background strain) mice, to investigate excitatory neurotransmission onto 
      striatal SPN. SPN in T-S coculture from WT mice showed similar mini-excitatory 
      postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency and amplitude as in C-S coculture; 
      however, both the frequency and amplitude were significantly reduced in YAC128 
      T-S coculture. Further investigation in T-S coculture showed similar excitatory 
      synapse density in WT and YAC128 SPN dendrites by immunostaining, suggesting 
      changes in total dendritic length or probability of release as possible 
      explanations for mEPSC frequency changes. Synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 
      (NMDAR) current was similar, but extrasynaptic current, associated with cell 
      death signaling, was enhanced in YAC128 SPN in T-S coculture. Employing optical 
      stimulation of cortical versus thalamic afferents and recording from striatal SPN 
      in brain slice, we found increased glutamate release probability and reduced 
      AMPAR/NMDAR current ratios in thalamostriatal synapses, most prominently in 
      YAC128. Enhanced extrasynaptic NMDAR current in YAC128 SPN was apparent with both 
      cortical and thalamic stimulation. We conclude that thalamic afferents to the 
      striatum are affected early, prior to an overt HD phenotype; however, changes in 
      NMDAR localization in SPN are independent of the source of glutamatergic input.

AB  - RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a widely used technique for 
      detecting transcripts in fixed cells and tissues. Many variants of RNA FISH have 
      been proposed to increase signal strength, resolution and target specificity. The 
      current variants of this technique facilitate the detection of the subcellular 
      localization of transcripts at a single molecule level. Among the applications of 
      RNA FISH are studies on nuclear RNA foci in diseases resulting from the expansion 
      of tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide repeats present in different single 
      genes. The partial or complete retention of mutant transcripts forming RNA 
      aggregates within the nucleoplasm has been shown in multiple cellular disease 
      models and in the tissues of patients affected with these atypical mutations. 
      Relevant diseases include, among others, myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) with CUG 
      repeats, Huntington's disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) with 
      CAG repeats, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) with CGG 
      repeats, myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) with CCUG repeats, amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD) with GGGGCC repeats and 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 32 (SCA32) with GGCCUG. In this article, we summarize 
      the results obtained with FISH to examine RNA nuclear inclusions. We provide a 
      detailed protocol for detecting RNAs containing expanded CAG and CUG repeats in 
      different cellular models, including fibroblasts, lymphoblasts, induced 
      pluripotent stem cells and murine and human neuronal progenitors. We also present 
      the results of the first single-molecule FISH application in a cellular model of 
      polyglutamine disease.

TI  - Mutant Huntingtin Does Not Affect the Intrinsic Phenotype of Human Huntington's 
      Disease T Lymphocytes.

AB  - Huntington's disease is a fatal neurodegenerative condition caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. The peripheral innate immune system is 
      dysregulated in Huntington's disease and may contribute to its pathogenesis. 
      However, it is not clear whether or to what extent the adaptive immune system is 
      also involved. Here, we carry out the first comprehensive investigation of human 
      ex vivo T lymphocytes in Huntington's disease, focusing on the frequency of a 
      range of T lymphocyte subsets, as well as analysis of proliferation, cytokine 
      production and gene transcription. In contrast to the innate immune system, the 
      intrinsic phenotype of T lymphocytes does not appear to be affected by the 
      presence of mutant huntingtin, with Huntington's disease T lymphocytes exhibiting 
      no significant functional differences compared to control cells. The 
      transcriptional profile of T lymphocytes also does not appear to be significantly 
      affected, suggesting that peripheral immune dysfunction in Huntington's disease 
      is likely to be mediated primarily by the innate rather than the adaptive immune 
      system. This study increases our understanding of the effects of Huntington's 
      disease on peripheral tissues, while further demonstrating the differential 
      effects of the mutant protein on different but related cell types. Finally, this 
      study suggests that the potential use of novel therapeutics aimed at modulating 
      the Huntington's disease innate immune system should not be extended to include 
      the adaptive immune system.

TI  - Olesoxime suppresses calpain activation and mutant huntingtin fragmentation in 
      the BACHD rat.
PG  - 3632-53
LID - 10.1093/brain/awv290 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease is a fatal human neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the HTT gene, which translates into a mutant huntingtin 
      protein. A key event in the molecular pathogenesis of Huntington's disease is the 
      proteolytic cleavage of mutant huntingtin, leading to the accumulation of toxic 
      protein fragments. Mutant huntingtin cleavage has been linked to the 
      overactivation of proteases due to mitochondrial dysfunction and calcium 
      derangements. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of olesoxime, a 
      mitochondria-targeting, neuroprotective compound, in the BACHD rat model of 
      Huntington's disease. BACHD rats were treated with olesoxime via the food for 12 
      months. In vivo analysis covered motor impairments, cognitive deficits, mood 
      disturbances and brain atrophy. Ex vivo analyses addressed olesoxime's effect on 
      mutant huntingtin aggregation and cleavage, as well as brain mitochondria 
      function. Olesoxime improved cognitive and psychiatric phenotypes, and 
      ameliorated cortical thinning in the BACHD rat. The treatment reduced cerebral 
      mutant huntingtin aggregates and nuclear accumulation. Further analysis revealed 
      a cortex-specific overactivation of calpain in untreated BACHD rats. Treated 
      BACHD rats instead showed significantly reduced levels of mutant huntingtin 
      fragments due to the suppression of calpain-mediated cleavage. In addition, 
      olesoxime reduced the amount of mutant huntingtin fragments associated with 
      mitochondria, restored a respiration deficit, and enhanced the expression of 
      fusion and outer-membrane transport proteins. In conclusion, we discovered the 
      calpain proteolytic system, a key player in Huntington's disease and other 
      neurodegenerative disorders, as a target of olesoxime. Our findings suggest that 
      olesoxime exerts its beneficial effects by improving mitochondrial function, 
      which results in reduced calpain activation. The observed alleviation of 
      behavioural and neuropathological phenotypes encourages further investigations on 
      the use of olesoxime as a therapeutic for Huntington's disease.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in 
      the first exon of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. Molecular testing of Huntington 
      disease for diagnostic confirmation and disease prediction requires detection of 
      the CAG repeat expansion. There are three main types of HD genetic testing: (1) 
      diagnostic testing to confirm or rule out disease, (2) presymptomatic testing to 
      determine whether an at-risk individual inherited the expanded allele, and (3) 
      prenatal testing to determine whether the fetus has inherited the expanded 
      allele. This unit includes protocols that describe the complementary use of 
      polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and Southern blot hybridization to accurately 
      measure the CAG trinucleotide repeat size and interpret the test results. In 
      addition, an indirect linkage analysis that does not reveal the unwanted parental 
      HD status in a prenatal testing will also be discussed.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic disease caused by a CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion encoding a polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin (HTT) protein, 
      ultimately leading to neuronal loss and consequent cognitive decline and death. 
      As no treatments for HD currently exist, several chemical screens have been 
      performed using cell-based models of mutant HTT toxicity. These screens measured 
      single disease-related endpoints, such as cell death, but had low 'hit rates' and 
      limited dimensionality for therapeutic detection. Here, we have employed gene 
      expression microarray analysis of HD samples--a snapshot of the expression of 
      25,000 genes--to define a gene expression signature for HD from publically 
      available data. We used this information to mine a database for chemicals 
      positively and negatively correlated to the HD gene expression signature using 
      the Connectivity Map, a tool for comparing large sets of gene expression 
      patterns. Chemicals with negatively correlated expression profiles were highly 
      enriched for protective characteristics against mutant HTT fragment toxicity in 
      in vitro and in vivo models. This study demonstrates the potential of using gene 
      expression to mine chemical activity, guide chemical screening, and detect 
      potential novel therapeutic compounds. KEY MESSAGES: Single-endpoint chemical 
      screens have low therapeutic discovery hit-rates. In the context of HD, we guided 
      a chemical screen using gene expression data. The resulting chemicals were highly 
      enriched for suppressors of mutant HTT fragment toxicity. This study provides a 
      proof of concept for wider usage in all chemical screening.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A CAG repeat expansion in HTT has been known to cause Huntington's 
      disease for over 20 years. The genomic sequence of the 67 exon HTT is clear but 
      few reports have detailed alternative splicing or alternative transcripts. Most 
      eukaryotic genes with multiple exons show alternative splicing that increases the 
      diversity of the transcriptome and proteome: it would be surprising if a gene 
      with 67 known exons in its two major transcripts did not present some alternative 
      transcripts. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence of alternative transcripts 
      directly in human HTT. METHODS: An overlapping RT-PCR based approach was used to 
      determine novel HTT splice variants in human brain from HD patients and controls 
      and 3D protein homology modelling employed to investigate their significance on 
      the function of the HTT protein. RESULTS: Here we show multiple previously 
      unreported novel transcripts of HTT. Of the 22 splice variants found, eight were 
      in-frame with the potential to encode novel HTT protein isoforms. Two splice 
      variants were selected for further study; HTT Deltaex4,5,6 which results in the 
      skipping of exons 4, 5 and 6 and HTTex41b which includes a novel exon created via 
      partial retention of intron 41. 3D protein homology modelling showed that both 
      splice variants are of potential functional significance leading to the loss of a 
      karyopherin nuclear localisation signal and alterations to sites of 
      posttranslational modification. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of novel HTT 
      transcripts has implications for HTT protein isoform expression and function. 
      Understanding the functional significance of HTT alternative splicing would be 
      critical to guide the design of potential therapeutics in HD that aim to reduce 
      the toxic HTT transcript or protein product including RNA silencing and 
      correction of mis-splicing in disease.

TI  - Is There Convincing Evidence that Intermediate Repeats in the HTT Gene Cause 
      Huntington's Disease?
PG  - 141-8
LID - 10.3233/JHD-140120 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative 
      disease associated with a CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. A 
      trinucleotide size between 27 and 35 is considered 'intermediate' and not to 
      cause symptoms and signs of HD. There are articles claiming otherwise, however 
      publishing only the cases that have a HD phenotype introduces a significant 
      publication bias. Our objective is to determine if there is convincing evidence 
      that intermediate repeats (IA) cause HD. METHODS: Previously published case 
      reports on HTT intermediate repeat sizes and all cases from the Netherlands with 
      an IA were reviewed for clinical symptoms and signs. RESULTS: Four patients had a 
      clinical presentation of Huntington's disease and an IA out of ten reported cases 
      in literature. Between 2001 and 2012, 1,690 patients were tested for HD in the 
      Netherlands. One case out of 60 with an IA had a phenotype resembling HD, but had 
      already been published in a case report. CONCLUSION: Given the high background 
      frequency of intermediate alleles in several populations, the possibility of 
      developing HD would have huge implications for 1-7% of the normal population. It 
      is possible that IAs present as an endophenotype with the potential of subsequent 
      clinical manifestations. However, given the scarcity of convincing cases, the 
      lack of convincing biological evidence for pathogenicity of intermediate alleles, 
      and many genes still to be discovered for HD mimics, we find that it is premature 
      to claim that IAs can cause HD. We recommend systematic follow up of this group 
      of individuals and if possible brain pathology for confirmation or exclusion of 
      HD.

      Preschool-Aged Children.

LID - 10.1378/chest.15-0402 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) is a rare 
      neurocristopathy characterized by severe hypoventilation and autonomic 
      dysregulation, with typical presentation in the neonatal period, and deficient 
      cognitive skills in school-aged patients. We hypothesized that younger 
      (preschool) children with CCHS would also show neurocognitive delay and that 
      CCHS-related physiologic factors would impact neurocognitive test results. 
      METHODS: We studied developmental (Bayley) test results collected during routine 
      clinical care in 31 children (mean age 25.0 +/- 8.5 months; range, 6-40 months) 
      with PHOX2B mutation-confirmed CCHS by comparing them with the normative 
      reference mean from the Bayley standardization sample; we also examined 
      associations between Bayley scores and CCHS disease-related factors. RESULTS: 
      Preschool patients with CCHS fell significantly below the normative mean of 100 
      on Bayley indices of mental (mean, 83.35 +/- 24.75) and motor (mean, 73.33 +/- 20.48) 
      development (P < .001 for both). Significantly lower Bayley mental and motor 
      scores were associated with severe breath-holding spells, prolonged sinus pauses, 
      and need for 24 h/d artificial ventilation. Lower Bayley motor scores were also 
      associated with seizures. Bayley scores differed among children with the three 
      most common polyalanine repeat expansion mutation genotypes (mental, P = .001; 
      motor, P = .006), being essentially normal in children with the 20/25 genotype 
      but significantly lower in the other genotype groups (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: 
      These results confirm neurodevelopmental impairment of CCHS preschoolers, with 
      severity related to physiologic compromise and PHOX2B genotype. These findings 
      suggest that adverse effects begin early in the disease process, supporting the 
      need for neurodevelopmental monitoring and intervention from early infancy.

TI  - Oncologic Phenotype of Peripheral Neuroblastic Tumors Associated With PHOX2B 
      Non-Polyalanine Repeat Expansion Mutations.
PG  - 71-7
LID - 10.1002/pbc.25723 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Germline non-polyalanine repeat expansion mutations in PHOX2B (PHOX2B 
      NPARM) predispose to peripheral neuroblastic tumors (PNT), frequently in 
      association with other neurocristopathies: Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) or 
      congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). Although PHOX2B polyalanine 
      repeat expansions predispose to a low incidence of benign PNTs, the oncologic 
      phenotype associated with PHOX2B NPARM is still not known in detail. METHODS: We 
      analyzed prognostic factors, treatment toxicity, and outcome of patients with PNT 
      and PHOX2B NPARM. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were identified, six of whom also 
      had CCHS and/or HSCR, one also had late-onset hypoventilation with hypothalamic 
      dysfunction (LO-CHS/HD), and six had no other neurocristopathy. Four tumours were 
      "poorly differentiated," and nine were differentiated, including five 
      ganglioneuromas, three ganglioneuroblastomas, and one differentiating 
      neuroblastoma, hence illustrating that PHOX2B NPARM are predominantly associated 
      with differentiating tumors. Nevertheless, three patients had stage 4 and one 
      patient had stage 3 disease. Segmental chromosomal alterations, correlating with 
      poor prognosis, were found in all the six tumors analyzed by array-comparative 
      genomic hybridization. One patient died of tumor progression, one is on 
      palliative care, one died of hypoventilation, and 10 patients are still alive, 
      with median follow-up of 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Based on histological phenotype, 
      our series suggests that heterozygous PHOX2B NPARM do not fully preclude ganglion 
      cell differentiation in tumors. However, this tumor predisposition syndrome may 
      also be associated with poorly differentiated tumors with unfavorable genomic 
      profiles and clinically aggressive behaviors. The intrafamilial variability and 
      the unpredictable tumor prognosis should be considered in genetic counseling.

TI  - Novel BAC Mouse Model of Huntington's Disease with 225 CAG Repeats Exhibits an 
      Early Widespread and Stable Degenerative Phenotype.
PG  - 17-36
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unusually large CAG repeat expansions (>60) in exon one of Huntingtin 
      (HTT) are invariably associated with a juvenile-onset form of Huntington's 
      disease (HD), characterized by a more extensive and rapidly progressing 
      neuropathology than the more prevalent adult-onset form. However, existing mouse 
      models of HD that express the full-length Htt gene with CAG repeat lengths 
      associated with juvenile HD (ranging between ~75 to ~150 repeats in published 
      models) exhibit selective neurodegenerative phenotypes more consistent with 
      adult-onset HD. Objective: To determine if a very large CAG repeat (>200) in 
      full-length Htt elicits neurodegenerative phenotypes consistent with juvenile HD. 
      METHODS: Using a ...bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) system, we generated mice 
      expressing full-length mouse Htt with ~225 CAG repeats under control of the mouse 
      Htt promoter. Mice were characterized using behavioral, neuropathological, 
      biochemical and brain imaging methods. RESULTS: BAC-225Q mice exhibit phenotypes 
      consistent with a subset of features seen in juvenile-onset HD: very early motor 
      behavior abnormalities, reduced body weight, widespread and progressive increase 
      in Htt aggregates, gliosis, and neurodegeneration. Early striatal pathology was 
      observed, including reactive gliosis and loss of dopamine receptors, prior to 
      detectable volume loss. HD-related blood markers of impaired energy metabolism 
      and systemic inflammation were also increased. Aside from an age-dependent 
      progression of diffuse nuclear aggregates at 6 months of age to abundant neuropil 
      aggregates at 12 months of age, other pathological and motor phenotypes showed 
      little to no progression. CONCLUSIONS: The HD phenotypes present in animals 3 to 
      12 months of age make the BAC-225Q mice a unique and stable model of full-length 
      mutant Htt associated phenotypes, including body weight loss, behavioral 
      impairment and HD-like neurodegenerative phenotypes characteristic of 
      juvenile-onset HD and/or late-stage adult-onset HD.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) reflects the dominant consequences of a CAG-repeat 
      expansion in HTT. Analysis of common SNP-based haplotypes has revealed that most 
      European HD subjects have distinguishable HTT haplotypes on their normal and 
      disease chromosomes and that  approximately 50% of the latter share the same major HD 
      haplotype. We reasoned that sequence-level investigation of this founder 
      haplotype could provide significant insights into the history of HD and valuable 
      information for gene-targeting approaches. Consequently, we performed 
      whole-genome sequencing of HD and control subjects from four independent families 
      in whom the major European HD haplotype segregates with the disease. Analysis of 
      the full-sequence-based HTT haplotype indicated that these four families share a 
      common ancestor sufficiently distant to have permitted the accumulation of 
      family-specific variants. Confirmation of new CAG-expansion mutations on this 
      haplotype suggests that unlike most founders of human disease, the common 
      ancestor of HD-affected families with the major haplotype most likely did not 
      have HD. Further, availability of the full sequence data validated the use of SNP 
      imputation to predict the optimal variants for capturing heterozygosity in 
      personalized allele-specific gene-silencing approaches. As few as ten SNPs are 
      capable of revealing heterozygosity in more than 97% of European HD subjects. 
      Extension of allele-specific silencing strategies to the few remaining homozygous 
      individuals is likely to be achievable through additional known SNPs and 
      discovery of private variants by complete sequencing of HTT. These data suggest 
      that the current development of gene-based targeting for HD could be extended to 
      personalized allele-specific approaches in essentially all HD individuals of 
      European ancestry.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) results from a "premutation" 
      (PM) size CGG repeat expansion in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. 
      Cerebellar gait ataxia is the primary feature in some FXTAS patients causing 
      progressive disability. However, no studies have quantitatively characterized 
      gait and mobility deficits in FXTAS. We performed quantitative gait and mobility 
      analysis in seven FMR1 PM carriers with FXTAS and ataxia, six PM carriers without 
      FXTAS, and 18 age-matched controls. We studied four independent gait domains, 
      trunk range of motion (ROM), and movement transitions using an instrumented Timed 
      Up and Go (i-TUG). We correlated these outcome measures with FMR1 molecular 
      variables and clinical severity scales. PM carriers with FXTAS were globally 
      impaired in every gait performance domain except trunk ROM compared to controls. 
      These included total i-TUG duration, stride velocity, gait cycle time, cadence, 
      double-limb support and swing phase times, turn duration, step time before turn, 
      and turn-to-sit duration, and increased gait variability on several measures. 
      Carriers without FXTAS did not differ from controls on any parameters, but 
      double-limb support time was close to significance. Balance and disability scales 
      correlated with multiple gait and movement transition parameters, while the FXTAS 
      Rating Scale did not. This is the first study to quantitatively examine gait and 
      movement transitions in FXTAS patients. Gait characteristics were consistent with 
      those from previous cohorts with cerebellar ataxia. Sensitive measures like the 
      i-TUG may help determine efficacy of interventions, characterize disease 
      progression, and provide early markers of disease in FXTAS.

AB  - As a Mendelian neurodegenerative disorder, the genetic risk of Huntington's 
      disease (HD) is conferred entirely by an HTT CAG repeat expansion whose length is 
      the primary determinant of the rate of pathogenesis leading to disease onset. To 
      investigate the pathogenic process that precedes disease, we used genome-wide 
      association (GWA) analysis to identify loci harboring genetic variations that 
      alter the age at neurological onset of HD. A chromosome 15 locus displays two 
      independent effects that accelerate or delay onset by 6.1 years and 1.4 years, 
      respectively, whereas a chromosome 8 locus hastens onset by 1.6 years. 
      Association at MLH1 and pathway analysis of the full GWA results support a role 
      for DNA handling and repair mechanisms in altering the course of HD. Our findings 
      demonstrate that HD disease modification in humans occurs in nature and offer a 
      genetic route to identifying in-human validated therapeutic targets in this and 
      other Mendelian disorders.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin 
      (HTT) gene. Recent evidence suggests that HD is a consequence of multimodal, 
      non-mutually exclusive mechanisms of pathogenesis that involve both HTT protein- 
      and HTT RNA-triggered mechanisms. Here we provide further evidence for the role 
      of expanded HTT (expHTT) RNA in HD by demonstrating that a fragment of expHTT is 
      cytotoxic in the absence of any translation and that the extent of cytotoxicity 
      is similar to the cytotoxicity of an expHTT protein fragment encoded by a 
      transcript of similar length and with a similar repeat size. In addition, 
      full-length (FL) expHTT is retained in the nucleus. Overexpression of the 
      splicing factor muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) increases nuclear retention of expHTT 
      and decreases the expression of expHTT protein in the cytosol. The splicing and 
      nuclear export factor U2AF65 has the opposite effect, decreasing expHTT nuclear 
      retention and increasing expression of expHTT protein. This suggests that MBNL1 
      and U2AF65 play a role in nuclear export of expHTT RNA.

TI  - Expanding the Spectrum of Founder Mutations Causing Isolated 
      Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Deficiency.
PG  - E1378-85
LID - 10.1210/jc.2015-2262 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Loss of function (LoF) mutations in more than 20 genes are now known to 
      cause isolated GnRH deficiency (IGD) in humans. Most causal IGD mutations are 
      typically private, ie, limited to a single individual/pedigree. However, somewhat 
      paradoxically, four IGD genes (GNRH1, TAC3, PROKR2, and GNRHR) have been shown to 
      harbor LoF founder mutations that are shared by multiple unrelated individuals. 
      It is not known whether similar founder mutations occur in other IGD genes. 
      OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether shared deleterious 
      mutations in IGD-associated genes represent founder alleles. SETTING: This study 
      was an international collaboration among academic medical centers. METHODS: IGD 
      patients with shared mutations, defined as those documented in three or more 
      unrelated probands in 14 IGD-associated genes, were identified from various 
      academic institutions, the Human Gene Mutation Database, and literature reports 
      by other international investigators. Haplotypes of single-nucleotide 
      polymorphisms and short tandem repeats surrounding the mutations were constructed 
      to assess genetic ancestry. RESULTS: A total of eight founder mutations in five 
      genes, GNRHR (Q106R, R262Q, R139H), TACR3 (W275X), PROKR2 (R85H), FGFR1 (R250Q, 
      G687R), and HS6ST1 (R382W) were identified. Most founder alleles were present at 
      low frequency in the general population. The estimated age of these mutant 
      alleles ranged from 1925 to 5600 years and corresponded to the time of rapid 
      human population expansion. CONCLUSIONS: We have expanded the spectrum of founder 
      alleles associated with IGD to a total of eight founder mutations. In contrast to 
      the approximately 9000-year-old PROKR2 founder allele that may confer a 
      heterozygote advantage, the rest of the founder alleles are relatively more 
      recent in origin, in keeping with the timing of recent human population expansion 
      and any selective heterozygote advantage of these alleles requires further 
      evaluation.

TI  - Huntingtin Haplotypes Provide Prioritized Target Panels for Allele-specific 
      Silencing in Huntington Disease Patients of European Ancestry.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the Huntingtin gene (HTT). Heterozygous polymorphisms in cis 
      with the mutation allow for allele-specific suppression of the pathogenic HTT 
      transcript as a therapeutic strategy. To prioritize target selection, precise 
      heterozygosity estimates are needed across diverse HD patient populations. Here 
      we present the first comprehensive investigation of all common target alleles 
      across the HTT gene, using 738 reference haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project 
      and 2364 haplotypes from HD patients and relatives in Canada, Sweden, France, and 
      Italy. The most common HD haplotypes (A1, A2, and A3a) define mutually exclusive 
      sets of polymorphisms for allele-specific therapy in the greatest number of 
      patients. Across all four populations, a maximum of 80% are treatable using these 
      three target haplotypes. We identify a novel deletion found exclusively on the A1 
      haplotype, enabling potent and selective silencing of mutant HTT in approximately 
      40% of the patients. Antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the deletion 
      reduce mutant A1 HTT mRNA by 78% in patient cells while sparing wild-type HTT 
      expression. By suppressing specific haplotypes on which expanded CAG occurs, we 
      demonstrate a rational approach to the development of allele-specific therapy for 
      a monogenic disorder.

PG  - 9751-6
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1511810112 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
      glutamine repeat expansion in mutant huntingtin (mHtt). Despite the known genetic 
      cause of HD, the pathophysiology of this disease remains to be elucidated. 
      Inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) is an enzyme that displays soluble 
      inositol phosphate kinase activity, lipid kinase activity, and various 
      noncatalytic interactions. We report a severe loss of IPMK in the striatum of HD 
      patients and in several cellular and animal models of the disease. This depletion 
      reflects mHtt-induced impairment of COUP-TF-interacting protein 2 (Ctip2), a 
      striatal-enriched transcription factor for IPMK, as well as alterations in IPMK 
      protein stability. IPMK overexpression reverses the metabolic activity deficit in 
      a cell model of HD. IPMK depletion appears to mediate neural dysfunction, because 
      intrastriatal delivery of IPMK abates the progression of motor abnormalities and 
      rescues striatal pathology in transgenic murine models of HD.

TI  - Identifying Hotspots of Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Transmission Using 
      Spatial and Molecular Genetic Data.
PG  - 287-94
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiv387 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to identify and determine the etiology of "hotspots" of 
      concentrated multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-tuberculosis) risk in Lima, 
      Peru. METHODS: From 2009 to 2012, we conducted a prospective cohort study among 
      households of tuberculosis cases from 106 health center (HC) areas in Lima, Peru. 
      All notified tuberculosis cases and their household contacts were followed for 1 
      year. Symptomatic individuals were screened by microscopy and culture; positive 
      cultures were tested for drug susceptibility (DST) and genotyped by 24-loci 
      mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable-number tandem repeats 
      (MIRU-VNTR). RESULTS: 3286 individuals with culture-confirmed disease, DST, and 
      24-loci MIRU-VNTR were included in our analysis. Our analysis reveals: (1) 
      heterogeneity in annual per-capita incidence of tuberculosis and MDR-tuberculosis 
      by HC, with a rate of MDR-tuberculosis 89 times greater (95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 54,185) in the most-affected versus the least-affected HC; (2) high risk 
      for MDR-tuberculosis in a region spanning several HCs (odds ratio = 3.19, 95% CI, 
      2.33, 4.36); and (3) spatial aggregation of MDR-tuberculosis genotypes, 
      suggesting localized transmission. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal that 
      localized transmission is an important driver of the epidemic of MDR-tuberculosis 
      in Lima. Efforts to interrupt transmission may be most effective if targeted to 
      this area of the city.

TI  - Exploring Genetic Factors Involved in Huntington Disease Age of Onset: E2F2 as a 
      New Potential Modifier Gene.
PG  - e0131573
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0131573 [doi]
LID - e0131573
AB  - Age of onset (AO) of Huntington disease (HD) is mainly determined by the length 
      of the CAG repeat expansion (CAGexp) in exon 1 of the HTT gene. Additional 
      genetic variation has been suggested to contribute to AO, although the mechanism 
      by which it could affect AO is presently unknown. The aim of this study is to 
      explore the contribution of candidate genetic factors to HD AO in order to gain 
      insight into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this disorder. For that 
      purpose, two AO definitions were used: the earliest age with unequivocal signs of 
      HD (earliest AO or eAO), and the first motor symptoms age (motor AO or mAO). 
      Multiple linear regression analyses were performed between genetic variation 
      within 20 candidate genes and eAO or mAO, using DNA and clinical information of 
      253 HD patients from REGISTRY project. Gene expression analyses were carried out 
      by RT-qPCR with an independent sample of 35 HD patients from Basque Country 
      Hospitals. We found suggestive association signals between HD eAO and/or mAO and 
      genetic variation within the E2F2, ATF7IP, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, LINC01559, HIP1 and 
      GRIK2 genes. Among them, the most significant was the association between eAO and 
      rs2742976, mapping to the promoter region of E2F2 transcription factor. 
      Furthermore, rs2742976 T allele patient carriers exhibited significantly lower 
      lymphocyte E2F2 gene expression, suggesting a possible implication of 
      E2F2-dependent transcriptional activity in HD pathogenesis. Thus, E2F2 emerges as 
      a new potential HD AO modifier factor.

AB  - In humans, neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease (HD) and many 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) have been found to be associated with CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion. An important RNA-mediated mechanism that causes 
      these diseases involves the binding of the splicing regulator protein MBNL1 
      (Muscleblind-like 1 protein) to expanded r(CAG) repeats. Moreover, mutant 
      huntingtin protein translated from expanded r(CAG) also yields toxic effects. To 
      discern the role of mutant RNA in these diseases, it is essential to gather 
      information about its structure. Detailed insight into the different structures 
      and conformations adopted by these mutant transcripts is vital for developing 
      therapeutics targeting them. Here, we report the crystal structure of an RNA 
      model with a r(CAG) motif, which is complemented by an NMR-based solution 
      structure obtained from restrained Molecular Dynamics (rMD) simulation studies. 
      Crystal structure data of the RNA model resolved at 2.3 A reveals non-canonical 
      pairing of adenine in 5 -CAG/3 -GAC motif samples in different syn and anti 
      conformations. The overall RNA structure has helical parameters intermediate to 
      the A- and B-forms of nucleic acids due to the global widening of major grooves 
      and base-pair preferences near internal AA loops. The comprehension of structural 
      behaviour by studying the spectral features and the dynamics also supports the 
      flexible nature of the r(CAG) motif.

TI  - Huntington's disease cerebrospinal fluid seeds aggregation of mutant huntingtin.
PG  - 1286-93
LID - 10.1038/mp.2015.81 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease, is caused by 
      an expanded CAG triplet repeat producing a mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT) with 
      a polyglutamine-repeat expansion. Onset of symptoms in mutant huntingtin 
      gene-carrying individuals remains unpredictable. We report that synthetic 
      polyglutamine oligomers and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from BACHD transgenic rats 
      and from human HD subjects can seed mutant huntingtin aggregation in a cell model 
      and its cell lysate. Our studies demonstrate that seeding requires the mutant 
      huntingtin template and may reflect an underlying prion-like protein propagation 
      mechanism. Light and cryo-electron microscopy show that synthetic seeds nucleate 
      and enhance mutant huntingtin aggregation. This seeding assay distinguishes HD 
      subjects from healthy and non-HD dementia controls without overlap (blinded 
      samples). Ultimately, this seeding property in HD patient CSF may form the basis 
      of a molecular biomarker assay to monitor HD and evaluate therapies that target 
      mHTT.

TI  - Psychiatric and cognitive symptoms in Huntington's disease are modified by 
      polymorphisms in catecholamine regulating enzyme genes.

LID - 10.1111/cge.12628 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder characterized by motor, psychiatric, and cognitive manifestations. HD is 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene but the exact 
      pathogenesis remains unknown. Dopamine imbalance has previously been shown in HD, 
      and furthermore dopamine is thought to be implicated in cognition, behavioral and 
      motor disturbances. A substantiated inverse correlation between motor onset and 
      the elongated CAG repeat in the HTT has been established. This relation does not 
      account for the full variability of the motor onset, and efforts have been put 
      into finding genetic modifiers of motor onset, however, mostly with unsuccessful 
      outcome. In this study, we took an alternative approach focusing on symptom 
      complexes and searched for modifiers of cognitive impairment and psychiatric 
      symptoms in a well-described cohort of Danish HD gene-expansion carriers. We show 
      that cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms in HD are modified by 
      polymorphisms in the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and catechol-O-methyltransferase 
      (COMT) genes and by the 4p16.3 B haplotype. These results support the theory of 
      dopamine imbalance in HD, and point toward more personalized treatment modalities 
      of HD in the future.

TI  - Junctophilin 3 (JPH3) expansion mutations causing Huntington disease like 2 
      (HDL2) are common in South African patients with African ancestry and a 
      Huntington disease phenotype.
PG  - 573-85
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32332 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder, characterized by abnormal movements, cognitive decline, and psychiatric 
      symptoms, caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene on 
      chromosome 4p. A CAG/CTG repeat expansion in the junctophilin-3 (JPH3) gene on 
      chromosome 16q24.2 causes a Huntington disease-like phenotype (HDL2). All 
      patients to date with HDL2 have some African ancestry. The present study aimed to 
      characterize the genetic basis of the Huntington disease phenotype in South 
      Africans and to investigate the possible origin of the JPH3 mutation. In a sample 
      of unrelated South African individuals referred for diagnostic HD testing, 62% 
      (106/171) of white patients compared to only 36% (47/130) of black patients had 
      an expansion in HTT. However, 15% (20/130) of black South African patients and no 
      white patients (0/171) had an expansion in JPH3, confirming the diagnosis of 
      Huntington disease like 2 (HDL2). Individuals with HDL2 share many clinical 
      features with individuals with HD and are clinically indistinguishable in many 
      cases, although the average age of onset and diagnosis in HDL2 is 5 years later 
      than HD and individual clinical features may be more prominent. HDL2 mutations 
      contribute significantly to the HD phenotype in South Africans with African 
      ancestry. JPH3 haplotype studies in 31 families, mainly from South Africa and 
      North America, provide evidence for a founder mutation and support a common 
      African origin for all HDL2 patients. Molecular testing in individuals with an HD 
      phenotype and African ancestry should include testing routinely for JPH3 
      mutations.

AB  - Allele-specific gene therapy aims to silence expression of mutant alleles through 
      targeting of disease-linked single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, SNP 
      linkage to disease varies between populations, making such molecular therapies 
      applicable only to a subset of patients. Moreover, not all SNPs have the 
      molecular features necessary for potent gene silencing. Here we provide knowledge 
      to allow the maximisation of patient coverage by building a comprehensive 
      understanding of SNPs ranked according to their predicted suitability toward 
      allele-specific silencing in 14 repeat expansion diseases: amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, 
      myotonic dystrophy 1, myotonic dystrophy 2, Huntington's disease and several 
      spinocerebellar ataxias. Our systematic analysis of DNA sequence variation shows 
      that most annotated SNPs are not suitable for potent allele-specific silencing 
      across populations because of suboptimal sequence features and low variability 
      (>97% in HD). We suggest maximising patient coverage by selecting SNPs with high 
      heterozygosity across populations, and preferentially targeting SNPs that lead to 
      purine:purine mismatches in wild-type alleles to obtain potent allele-specific 
      silencing. We therefore provide fundamental knowledge on strategies for 
      optimising patient coverage of therapeutics for microsatellite expansion 
      disorders by linking analysis of population genetic variation to the selection of 
      molecular targets.

AB  - : Huntington's disease (HD) results from a CAG repeat expansion in the gene 
      encoding the huntingtin protein. This inherited disorder is characterized by 
      progressive neurodegeneration. In particular, HD progression involves the loss of 
      striatal projection neurons. The limited availability of reliable sources of 
      human striatal projection neurons currently hampers our understanding of HD 
      mechanisms and hinders the development of novel HD treatments. In this paper, we 
      described two- and three-step methods for differentiating human neural progenitor 
      cells toward striatal projection neurons. In the two-step differentiation 
      protocol, 90%, 54%, and 6% of MAP2-positive cells were immunopositive for GABA, 
      calbindin (CALB1), and DARPP-32/PPP1R1B, respectively. In the three-step 
      differentiation protocol, 96%, 84%, and 21% of MAP2-positive cells were 
      immunopositive for GABA, calbindin, and DARPP-32/PPP1R1B, respectively. In line 
      with a striatal projection neuron phenotype, cells differentiated with our 
      protocols displayed significantly increased expression of MAP2, CALB1, 
      DARPP-32/PPP1R1B, ARPP21, and CTIP2. Application of glutamate receptor agonists 
      induced calcium influx; accordingly, the cells also expressed various ionotropic 
      glutamate receptor subunits. Differentiated cells also released GABA on 
      stimulation. We suggest that our three-step differentiation protocol presents a 
      reliable and simplified method for the generation of striatal projection neurons, 
      yielding a critical resource for neuronal physiology and neurodegenerative 
      disorder studies. SIGNIFICANCE: The earliest changes in the neurodegenerative 
      disorder Huntington's disease affect a specific type of brain neurons, the 
      so-called medium spiny neurons of the striatum. In this study, two protocols were 
      developed for the differentiation of neural progenitor cells into striatal medium 
      spiny neurons, and the differentiated neurons were extensively characterized. The 
      data indicate that the three-step differentiation protocol presents a reliable 
      and simplified method for the generation of striatal medium spiny neurons. The 
      generated striatal medium spiny neurons could represent a critical resource for 
      the study of neurodegenerative disorders, a model system for drug discovery, and 
      a step toward cell-based regeneration therapies.

TI  - The role of tau in the pathological process and clinical expression of 
      Huntington's disease.
PG  - 1907-18
LID - 10.1093/brain/awv107 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an abnormal CAG 
      repeat expansion within exon 1 of the huntingtin gene HTT. While several genetic 
      modifiers, distinct from the Huntington's disease locus itself, have been 
      identified as being linked to the clinical expression and progression of 
      Huntington's disease, the exact molecular mechanisms driving its pathogenic 
      cascade and clinical features, especially the dementia, are not fully understood. 
      Recently the microtubule associated protein tau, MAPT, which is associated with 
      several neurodegenerative disorders, has been implicated in Huntington's disease. 
      We explored this association in more detail at the neuropathological, genetic and 
      clinical level. We first investigated tau pathology by looking for the presence 
      of hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates, co-localization of tau with mutant HTT and 
      its oligomeric intermediates in post-mortem brain samples from patients with 
      Huntington's disease (n = 16) compared to cases with a known tauopathy and 
      healthy controls. Next, we undertook a genotype-phenotype analysis of a large 
      cohort of patients with Huntington's disease (n = 960) with a particular focus on 
      cognitive decline. We report not only on the tau pathology in the Huntington's 
      disease brain but also the association between genetic variation in tau gene and 
      the clinical expression and progression of the disease. We found extensive 
      pathological inclusions containing abnormally phosphorylated tau protein that 
      co-localized in some instances with mutant HTT. We confirmed this related to the 
      disease process rather than age, by showing it is also present in two patients 
      with young-onset Huntington's disease (26 and 40 years old at death). In addition 
      we demonstrate that tau oligomers (suggested to be the most likely neurotoxic tau 
      entity) are present in the Huntington's disease brains. Finally we highlight the 
      clinical significance of this pathology by demonstrating that the MAPT haplotypes 
      affect the rate of cognitive decline in a large cohort of patients with 
      Huntington's disease. Our findings therefore highlight a novel important role of 
      tau in the pathogenic process and clinical expression of Huntington's disease, 
      which in turn opens up new therapeutic avenues for this incurable condition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder, characterized by motor, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. HD is 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of the HTT gene, resulting in 
      an expanded polyglutamine tract at the N-terminus of the huntingtin protein. 
      Typical disease onset is around mid-life (adult-onset HD) whereas onset below 21 
      years is classified as juvenile HD. While much research has been done on the 
      underlying HD disease mechanisms, little is known about regulation and expression 
      levels of huntingtin RNA and protein. RESULTS: In this study we used 15 human 
      post-mortem HD brain samples to investigate the expression of wild-type and 
      mutant huntingtin mRNA and protein. In adult-onset HD brain samples, there was a 
      small but significantly lower expression of mutant huntingtin mRNA compared to 
      wild-type huntingtin mRNA, while wild-type and mutant huntingtin protein 
      expression levels did not differ significantly. Juvenile HD subjects did show a 
      lower expression of mutant huntingtin protein compared to wild-type huntingtin 
      protein. Our results in HD brain and fibroblasts suggest that protein aggregation 
      does not affect levels of huntingtin RNA and protein. Additionally, we did not 
      find any evidence for a reduced expression of huntingtin antisense in fibroblasts 
      derived from a homozygous HD patient. CONCLUSIONS: We found small differences in 
      allelic huntingtin mRNA levels in adult-onset HD brain, with significantly lower 
      mutant huntingtin mRNA levels. Wild-type and mutant huntingtin protein were not 
      significantly different in adult-onset HD brain samples. Conversely, in juvenile 
      HD brain samples mutant huntingtin protein levels were lower compared with 
      wild-type huntingtin, showing subtle differences between juvenile HD and 
      adult-onset HD. Since most HD model systems harbor juvenile repeat expansions, 
      our results suggest caution with the interpretation of huntingtin mRNA and 
      protein studies using HD cell and animal models with such long repeats. 
      Furthermore, our huntingtin antisense results in homozygous HD cells do not 
      support reduced huntingtin antisense expression due to an expanded CAG repeat.

TI  - Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome susceptible genes in the Chinese population: a 
      meta-analysis of 21 case-control studies.
PG  - 1441-8

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified as 
      risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in the Chinese 
      population; however, published articles drew incompatible or even contradictory 
      results. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the susceptible SNPs 
      and risk of OSAS in the Chinese population. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis 
      of seven polymorphisms and risk of OSAS based on 21 case-control studies. 
      RESULTS: The results of our study showed that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) 
      -308 G/A (OR = 3.70, 95 % CI = 1.39-9.83), gene-linked polymorphic region (LPR) 
      (OR = 0.57, 95 % CI = 0.41-0.79), and variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) of the 
      5-hydroxytryptamine transporter gene (5-HTT) (OR = 3.44, 95 % CI = 1.49-7.95) 
      polymorphisms were associated with OSAS risk in the Chinese population, while 
      there was no significant association between 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor 
      (5-HTR2A) 102C/T, 5-HTR2A A1438G, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion 
      (I)/deletion (D), or leptin receptor (LEPR)-Gln 223Arg polymorphism and risk of 
      OSAS in the Chinese population. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that TNF-alpha 
      308 G/A, 5-HTT LPR, and 5-HTT-VNTR polymorphisms were associated with OSAS risk, 
      whereas little association was observed between 5-HTR2A 102C/T, 5-HTR2A A1438G, 
      ACE I/D, or LEPR-Gln 223Arg polymorphism and risk of OSAS in the Chinese 
      population.

TI  - miR-10b-5p expression in Huntington's disease brain relates to age of onset and 
      the extent of striatal involvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that recognize sites of 
      complementarity of target messenger RNAs, resulting in transcriptional regulation 
      and translational repression of target genes. In Huntington's disease (HD), a 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion, miRNA 
      dyregulation has been reported, which may impact gene expression and modify the 
      progression and severity of HD. METHODS: We performed next-generation miRNA 
      sequence analysis in prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 9) from 26 HD, 2 HD gene 
      positive, and 36 control brains. Neuropathological information was available for 
      all HD brains, including age at disease onset, CAG-repeat size, Vonsattel grade, 
      and Hadzi-Vonsattel striatal and cortical scores, a continuous measure of the 
      extent of neurodegeneration. Linear models were performed to examine the 
      relationship of miRNA expression to these clinical features, and messenger RNA 
      targets of associated miRNAs were tested for gene ontology term enrichment. 
      RESULTS: We identified 75 miRNAs differentially expressed in HD brain (FDR 
      q-value <0.05). Among the HD brains, nine miRNAs were significantly associated 
      with Vonsattel grade of neuropathological involvement and three of these, 
      miR-10b-5p, miR-10b-3p, and miR-302a-3p, significantly related to the 
      Hadzi-Vonsattel striatal score (a continuous measure of striatal involvement) 
      after adjustment for CAG length. Five miRNAs (miR-10b-5p, miR-196a-5p, 
      miR-196b-5p, miR-10b-3p, and miR-106a-5p) were identified as having a significant 
      relationship to CAG length-adjusted age of onset including miR-10b-5p, the mostly 
      strongly over-expressed miRNA in HD cases. Although prefrontal cortex was the 
      source of tissue profiled in these studies, the relationship of miR-10b-5p 
      expression to striatal involvement in the disease was independent of cortical 
      involvement. Correlation of miRNAs to the clinical features clustered by 
      direction of effect and the gene targets of the observed miRNAs showed 
      association to processes relating to nervous system development and 
      transcriptional regulation. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that miRNA 
      expression in cortical BA9 provides insight into striatal involvement and support 
      a role for these miRNAs, particularly miR-10b-5p, in HD pathogenicity. The miRNAs 
      identified in our studies of postmortem brain tissue may be detectable in 
      peripheral fluids and thus warrant consideration as accessible biomarkers for 
      disease stage, rate of progression, and other important clinical characteristics 
      of HD.

TI  - RTP801 Is Involved in Mutant Huntingtin-Induced Cell Death.
PG  - 2857-2868
LID - 10.1007/s12035-015-9166-6 [doi]
AB  - RTP801 expression is induced by cellular stress and has a pro-apoptotic function 
      in non-proliferating differentiated cells such as neurons. In several 
      neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's 
      disease, elevated levels of RTP801 have been observed, which suggests a role for 
      RTP801 in neuronal death. Neuronal death is also a pathological hallmark in 
      Huntington's disease (HD), an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Currently, the exact mechanisms 
      underlying mutant huntingtin (mhtt)-induced toxicity are still unclear. Here, we 
      investigated whether RTP801 is involved in (mhtt)-induced cell death. Ectopic 
      exon-1 mhtt elevated RTP801 mRNA and protein levels in nerve growth factor 
      (NGF)-differentiated PC12 cells and in rat primary cortical neurons. In neuronal 
      PC12 cells, mhtt also contributed to RTP801 protein elevation by reducing its 
      proteasomal degradation rate, in addition to promoting RTP801 gene expression. 
      Interestingly, silencing RTP801 expression with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) 
      blocked mhtt-induced cell death in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells. However, RTP801 
      protein levels were not altered in the striatum of Hdh(Q7/Q111) and R6/1 mice, 
      two HD models that display motor deficits but not neuronal death. Importantly, 
      RTP801 protein levels were elevated in both neural telencephalic progenitors 
      differentiated from HD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and in the 
      putamen and cerebellum of human HD postmortem brains. Taken together, our results 
      suggest that RTP801 is a novel downstream effector of mhtt-induced toxicity and 
      that it may be relevant to the human disease.

TI  - Dysfunctional Dopaminergic Neurones in Mouse Models of Huntington's Disease: A 
      Role for SK3 Channels.
PG  - 93-108
LID - 10.1159/000375126 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a late-onset fatal neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the gene coding for 
      the protein huntingtin and is characterised by progressive motor, psychiatric and 
      cognitive decline. We previously demonstrated that normal synaptic function in HD 
      could be restored by application of dopamine receptor agonists, suggesting that 
      changes in the release or bioavailability of dopamine may be a contributing 
      factor to the disease process. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we examined the 
      properties of midbrain dopaminergic neurones and dopamine release in 
      presymptomatic and symptomatic transgenic HD mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using 
      intracellular sharp recordings and immunohistochemistry, we found that neuronal 
      excitability was increased due to a loss of slow afterhyperpolarisation and that 
      these changes were related to an apparent functional loss and abnormal 
      distribution of SK3 channels (KCa2.3 encoded by the KCNN3 gene), a class of 
      small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels. Electrochemical detection 
      of dopamine showed that this observation was associated with an enhanced dopamine 
      release in presymptomatic transgenic mice and a drastic reduction in symptomatic 
      animals. These changes occurred in the context of a progressive expansion in the 
      CAG repeat number and nuclear localisation of mutant protein within the 
      substantia nigra pars compacta. CONCLUSIONS: Dopaminergic neuronal dysfunction is 
      a key early event in HD disease progression. The initial increase in dopamine 
      release appears to be related to a loss of SK3 channel function, a protein 
      containing a polyglutamine tract. Implications for polyglutamine-mediated 
      sequestration of SK3 channels, dopamine-associated DNA damage and CAG expansion 
      are discussed in the context of HD.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Major 
      pathological hallmarks of HD include inclusions of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) 
      protein, loss of neurons predominantly in the caudate nucleus, and atrophy of 
      multiple brain regions. However, the early sequence of histological events that 
      manifest in region- and cell-specific manner has not been well characterized. 
      Here we use a high-content histological approach to precisely monitor changes in 
      HTT expression and characterize deposition dynamics of mHTT protein inclusion 
      bodies in the recently characterized zQ175 knock-in mouse line. We carried out an 
      automated multi-parameter quantitative analysis of individual cortical and 
      striatal cells in tissue slices from mice aged 2-12 months and confirmed 
      biochemical reports of an age-associated increase in mHTT inclusions in this 
      model. We also found distinct regional and subregional dynamics for inclusion 
      number, size and distribution with subcellular resolution. We used viral-mediated 
      suppression of total HTT in the striatum of zQ175 mice as an example of a 
      therapeutically-relevant but heterogeneously transducing strategy to demonstrate 
      successful application of this platform to quantitatively assess target 
      engagement and outcome on a cellular basis.

      Vitro and In Vivo.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of huntingtin (HTT). Studies in mouse 
      models of HD with a regulated mutant transgene show that continuous mutant allele 
      expression is required for behavioral and pathological signs; when mutant HTT 
      expression declined, neuronal degeneration improved. To date, it is unknown 
      whether neural cells in the adult human brain can tolerate reduction in both 
      normal and mutant alleles. Thus, it may be important to develop allele-specific 
      silencing approaches. Several siRNA sequences targeting the CAG expanded motif or 
      prevalent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in linkage disequilibrium with 
      the mutant allele have been designed and their selectivity demonstrated in vitro. 
      However, it is unknown whether these allele-specific siRNAs will retain their 
      specificity when expressed from artificial RNAi platforms. Here, we designed CAG- 
      and SNP- targeting artificial miRNAs and demonstrate that some, but not all, 
      retained their selectivity in vitro using an allele-specific reporter system and 
      in vivo in a transgenic mouse model developed to express normal and mutant human 
      HTT alleles.

TI  - Cardiac Fas-Dependent and Mitochondria-Dependent Apoptotic Pathways in a 
      Transgenic Mouse Model of Huntington's Disease.
PG  - 111-21

AB  - Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by 
      a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Heart disease is the second 
      leading cause of death in patients with Huntington's disease. This study was to 
      evaluate whether cardiac Fas-dependent and mitochondria-dependent apoptotic 
      pathways are activated in transgenic mice with Huntington's disease. Sixteen 
      Huntington's disease transgenic mice (HD) and sixteen wild-type (WT) littermates 
      were studied at 10.5 weeks of age. The cardiac characteristics, myocardial 
      architecture, and two major apoptotic pathways in the excised left ventricle from 
      mice were measured by histopathological analysis, Western blotting, and TUNEL 
      assays. The whole heart weight and the left ventricular weight decreased 
      significantly in the HD group, as compared to the WT group. Abnormal myocardial 
      architecture, enlarged interstitial spaces, and more cardiac TUNEL-positive cells 
      were observed in the HD group. The key components of Fas-dependent apoptosis 
      (TNF-alpha, TNFR1, Fas ligand, Fas death receptors, FADD, activated caspase-8, 
      and activated caspase-3) and the key components of mitochondria-dependent 
      apoptosis (Bax, Bax-to-Bcl-2 ratio, cytosolic cytochrome c, activated caspase-9, 
      and activated caspase-3) increased significantly in the hearts of the HD group. 
      Cardiac Fas-dependent and mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathways were 
      activated in transgenic mice with Huntington's disease, which might provide one 
      of possible mechanisms to explain why patients with Huntington's disease will 
      develop heart failure.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion that encodes a polyglutamine tract in huntingtin (htt) 
      protein. Dysregulation of brain iron homeostasis, oxidative stress and 
      neurodegeneration are consistent features of the HD phenotype. Therefore, 
      environmental factors that exacerbate oxidative stress and iron dysregulation may 
      potentiate HD. Iron supplementation in the human population is common during 
      infant and adult-life stages. In this study, iron supplementation in neonatal HD 
      mice resulted in deterioration of spontaneous motor running activity, elevated 
      levels of brain lactate and oxidized glutathione consistent with increased 
      energetic dysfunction and oxidative stress, and increased striatal and motor 
      cortical neuronal atrophy, collectively demonstrating potentiation of the disease 
      phenotype. Oxidative stress, energetic, and anatomic markers of degeneration were 
      not affected in wild-type littermate iron-supplemented mice. Further, there was 
      no effect of elevated iron intake on disease outcomes in adult HD mice. We have 
      demonstrated an interaction between the mutant huntingtin gene and iron 
      supplementation in neonatal HD mice. Findings indicate that elevated neonatal 
      iron intake potentiates mouse HD and promotes oxidative stress and energetic 
      dysfunction in brain. Neonatal-infant dietary iron intake level may be an 
      environmental modifier of human HD.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurological genetic disorder caused by the 
      expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeats (TNR) in the N-terminal region of 
      coding sequence of the Huntingtin's (HTT) gene. This results in the addition of a 
      poly-glutamine tract within the Huntingtin protein, resulting in its pathological 
      form. The mechanism by which TRN expansion takes place is not yet fully 
      understood. We have recently shown that DNA polymerase (Pol) beta can promote the 
      microhomology-mediated end joining and triplet expansion of a substrate mimicking 
      a double strand break in the TNR region of the HTT gene. Here we show that TNR 
      expansion is dependent on the structure of the DNA substrate, as well as on the 
      two essential Pol beta co-factors: flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1) and DNA ligase 1 
      (Lig1). We found that Fen1 significantly stimulated TNR expansion by Pol beta, but 
      not by the related enzyme Pol lambda, and subsequent ligation of the DNA products by 
      Lig1. Interestingly, the deletion of N-terminal domains of Pol lambda, resulted in an 
      enzyme which displayed properties more similar to Pol beta, suggesting a possible 
      evolutionary mechanism. These results may suggest a novel mechanism for somatic 
      TNR expansion in HD.

AB  - The expansion of simple sequence CAG*CTG repeats is associated with a number of 
      inherited disorders including Huntington disease (HD), myotonic dystrophy type 1 
      and several of the spinocerebellar ataxias. Inherited disease-associated alleles 
      usually exceed 40 repeats and may be in excess of 1,000 repeats in some 
      disorders. Inherited allele length is inversely proportional to age at onset, and 
      frequent germline expansions account for the striking anticipation observed in 
      affected families. Expanded disease associated alleles are also somatically 
      unstable via a pathway that is age dependent and tissue specific, and also 
      appears to be expansion biased. Somatic expansions are thought to contribute 
      toward both tissue specificity and disease progression. Here we have examined the 
      somatic mutational dynamics in brain and peripheral tissues from an allelic 
      series of R6/2 HD transgenic mice inheriting from 52 to >700 CAG repeats. We 
      found age-dependent, tissue-specific somatic instability, with particularly large 
      expansions observed in the striatum and cortex. We also found a positive increase 
      in somatic instability with increasing allele length. Surprisingly, however, the 
      degree of somatic variation did not increase in a linear fashion, but leveled off 
      with increasing allele length. Most unexpectedly, the almost exclusive bias 
      toward the accumulation of expansions observed in mice inheriting smaller alleles 
      was lost, and a high frequency of large somatic contractions was observed in mice 
      inheriting very large alleles (>500 repeats). These data highlight the 
      bidirectional nature of CAG*CTG repeat instability and the subtle balance that 
      exists between expansion and contraction in vivo. Defining the dynamics and 
      tissue specificity of expansion and contraction is important for understanding 
      the role of genetic instability in pathophysiology and in particular the 
      development of novel therapies based on suppressing expansions and/or promoting 
      contractions.

TI  - Htt CAG repeat expansion confers pleiotropic gains of mutant huntingtin function 
      in chromatin regulation.
PG  - 2442-57
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddv006 [doi]
AB  - The CAG repeat expansion in the Huntington's disease gene HTT extends a 
      polyglutamine tract in mutant huntingtin that enhances its ability to facilitate 
      polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). To gain insight into this dominant gain of 
      function, we mapped histone modifications genome-wide across an isogenic panel of 
      mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) and neuronal progenitor cell (NPC) lines, 
      comparing the effects of Htt null and different size Htt CAG mutations. We found 
      that Htt is required in ESC for the proper deposition of histone H3K27me3 at a 
      subset of 'bivalent' loci but in NPC it is needed at 'bivalent' loci for both the 
      proper maintenance and the appropriate removal of this mark. In contrast, Htt CAG 
      size, though changing histone H3K27me3, is prominently associated with altered 
      histone H3K4me3 at 'active' loci. The sets of ESC and NPC genes with altered 
      histone marks delineated by the lack of huntingtin or the presence of mutant 
      huntingtin, though distinct, are enriched in similar pathways with apoptosis 
      specifically highlighted for the CAG mutation. Thus, the manner by which 
      huntingtin function facilitates PRC2 may afford mutant huntingtin with multiple 
      opportunities to impinge upon the broader machinery that orchestrates 
      developmentally appropriate chromatin status.

TI  - N-Acetylcysteine improves mitochondrial function and ameliorates behavioral 
      deficits in the R6/1 mouse model of Huntington's disease.
PG  - e492
LID - 10.1038/tp.2014.131 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, involving psychiatric, 
      cognitive and motor symptoms, caused by a CAG-repeat expansion encoding an 
      extended polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. Oxidative stress and 
      excitotoxicity have previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of HD. We 
      hypothesized that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may reduce both excitotoxicity and 
      oxidative stress through its actions on glutamate reuptake and antioxidant 
      capacity. The R6/1 transgenic mouse model of HD was used to investigate the 
      effects of NAC on HD pathology. It was found that chronic NAC administration 
      delayed the onset and progression of motor deficits in R6/1 mice, while having an 
      antidepressant-like effect on both R6/1 and wild-type mice. A deficit in the 
      astrocytic glutamate transporter protein, GLT-1, was found in R6/1 mice. However, 
      this deficit was not ameliorated by NAC, implying that the therapeutic effect of 
      NAC is not due to rescue of the GLT-1 deficit and associated glutamate-induced 
      excitotoxicity. Assessment of mitochondrial function in the striatum and cortex 
      revealed that R6/1 mice show reduced mitochondrial respiratory capacity specific 
      to the striatum. This deficit was rescued by chronic treatment with NAC. There 
      was a selective increase in markers of oxidative damage in mitochondria, which 
      was rescued by NAC. In conclusion, NAC is able to delay the onset of motor 
      deficits in the R6/1 model of Huntington's disease and it may do so by 
      ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, NAC shows promise as a potential 
      therapeutic agent in HD. Furthermore, our data suggest that NAC may also have 
      broader antidepressant efficacy.

AB  - New mutations for Huntington disease (HD) originate from CAG repeat expansion of 
      intermediate alleles (27-35 CAG). Expansions of such alleles into the 
      pathological range (>/= 36 CAG) have been exclusively observed in paternal 
      transmission. We report the occurrence of a new mutation that defies the paternal 
      expansion bias normally observed in HD. A maternal intermediate allele with 33 
      CAG repeats expanded in transmission to 48 CAG repeats causing a de novo case of 
      HD in the family. Retrospectively, the mother presented with cognitive decline, 
      but HD was never considered in the differential diagnosis. She was diagnosed with 
      dementia and testing for HD was only performed after her daughter had been 
      diagnosed. This observation of an intermediate allele expanding into the full 
      penetrance HD range after maternal transmission has important implications for 
      genetic counselling of females with intermediate repeats.

AB  - The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) regulates expression of numerous genes, 
      including those of the CYP1 gene family. With the goal of determining factors 
      that control AHR gene expression, our studies are focused on the role of the 
      short tandem repeat polymorphism, (GGGGC)n, located in the proximal promoter of 
      the human AHR gene. When luciferase constructs containing varying GGGGC repeats 
      were transfected into cancer cell lines derived from the lung, colon, and breast, 
      the number of GGGGC repeats affected AHR promoter activity. The number of GGGGC 
      repeats was determined in DNA from 327 humans and from 38 samples representing 5 
      species of non-human primates. In chimpanzees and 3 species of macaques, only 
      (GGGGC)2 alleles were observed; however, in western gorilla, (GGGGC)n alleles 
      with n=2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 were identified. In all human populations examined, 
      the frequency of (GGGGC)n was n=4>5>>2, 6. When frequencies of the (GGGGC)n 
      alleles in DNA from patients with lung, colon, or breast cancer were evaluated, 
      the occurrence of (GGGGC)2 was found to be 8-fold more frequent among lung cancer 
      patients in comparison with its incidence in the general population, as 
      represented by New York State neonates. Analysis of matched tumor and non-tumor 
      DNA samples from the same individuals provided no evidence of microsatellite 
      instability. These studies indicate that the (GGGGC)n short tandem repeats are 
      inherited, and that the (GGGGC)2 allele in the AHR proximal promoter region 
      should be further investigated with regard to its potential association with lung 
      cancer susceptibility.

AB  - Inflammation is a growing area of research in neurodegeneration. In Huntington's 
      disease (HD), a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG-repeat 
      expansion in the gene encoding huntingtin, patients have increased plasma levels 
      of inflammatory cytokines and circulating monocytes that are hyper-responsive to 
      immune stimuli. Several mouse models of HD also show elevated plasma levels of 
      inflammatory cytokines. To further determine the degree to which these models 
      recapitulate observations in HD patients, we evaluated various myeloid cell 
      populations from different HD mouse models to determine whether they are 
      similarly hyper-responsive, as well as measuring other aspects of myeloid cell 
      function. Myeloid cells from each of the three mouse models studied, R6/2, 
      HdhQ150 knock-in and YAC128, showed increased cytokine production when 
      stimulated. However, bone marrow CD11b(+) cells did not show the same 
      hyper-responsive phenotype as spleen and blood cells. Furthermore, macrophages 
      isolated from R6/2 mice show increased levels of phagocytosis, similar to 
      findings in HD patients. Taken together, these results show significant promise 
      for these mouse models to be used to study targeting innate immune pathways 
      identified in human cells, thereby helping to understand the role the peripheral 
      immune system plays in HD progression.

      Carriers.
LID - 1000119 [pii]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common single gene cause of intellectual 
      disability and it is characterized by a CGG expansion of more than 200 repeats in 
      the FMR1 gene, leading to methylation of the promoter and gene silencing. The 
      fragile X premutation, characterized by a 55 to 200 CGG repeat expansion, causes 
      health problems and developmental difficulties in some, but not all, carriers. 
      The premutation causes primary ovarian insufficiency in approximately 20% of 
      females, psychiatric problems (including depression and/or anxiety) in 
      approximately 50% of carriers and a neurodegenerative disorder, the fragile 
      X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), in approximately 40% of males and 
      16% of females later in life. Recent clinical studies in premutation carriers 
      have expanded the health problems that may be seen. Advances in the molecular 
      pathogenesis of the premutation have shown significant mitochondrial dysfunction 
      and oxidative stress in neurons which may be amenable to treatment. Here we 
      review the clinical problems of carriers and treatment recommendations.

PG  - 16889-94
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1420103111 [doi]
AB  - Although dominant gain-of-function triplet repeat expansions in the Huntingtin 
      (HTT) gene are the underlying cause of Huntington disease (HD), understanding the 
      normal functions of nonmutant HTT protein has remained a challenge. We report 
      here findings that suggest that HTT plays a significant role in selective 
      autophagy. Loss of HTT function in Drosophila disrupts starvation-induced 
      autophagy in larvae and conditional knockout of HTT in the mouse CNS causes 
      characteristic cellular hallmarks of disrupted autophagy, including an 
      accumulation of striatal p62/SQSTM1 over time. We observe that specific domains 
      of HTT have structural similarities to yeast Atg proteins that function in 
      selective autophagy, and in particular that the C-terminal domain of HTT shares 
      structural similarity to yeast Atg11, an autophagic scaffold protein. To explore 
      possible functional similarity between HTT and Atg11, we investigated whether the 
      C-terminal domain of HTT interacts with mammalian counterparts of yeast 
      Atg11-interacting proteins. Strikingly, this domain of HTT coimmunoprecipitates 
      with several key Atg11 interactors, including the Atg1/Unc-51-like autophagy 
      activating kinase 1 kinase complex, autophagic receptor proteins, and mammalian 
      Atg8 homologs. Mutation of a phylogenetically conserved WXXL domain in a 
      C-terminal HTT fragment reduces coprecipitation with mammalian Atg8 homolog 
      GABARAPL1, suggesting a direct interaction. Collectively, these data support a 
      possible central role for HTT as an Atg11-like scaffold protein. These findings 
      have relevance to both mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and to therapeutic 
      intervention strategies that reduce levels of both mutant and normal HTT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gene expression data provide invaluable insights into disease 
      mechanisms. In Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
      tri-nucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene, extensive transcriptional 
      dysregulation has been reported. Conventional dysregulation analysis has shown 
      that e.g. in the caudate nucleus of the post mortem HD brain the gene expression 
      level of about a third of all genes was altered. Owing to this large number of 
      dysregulated genes, the underlying relevance of expression changes is often lost 
      in huge gene lists that are difficult to comprehend. METHODS: To alleviate this 
      problem, we employed weighted correlation network analysis to archival gene 
      expression datasets of HD post mortem brain regions. RESULTS: We were able to 
      uncover previously unidentified transcription dysregulation in the HD cerebellum 
      that contained a gene expression signature in common with the caudate nucleus and 
      the BA4 region of the frontal cortex. Furthermore, we found that yet unassociated 
      pathways, e.g. global mRNA processing, were dysregulated in HD. We provide 
      evidence to show that, contrary to previous findings, mutant huntingtin is 
      sufficient to induce a subset of stress response genes in the cerebellum and 
      frontal cortex BA4 region. The comparison of HD with other neurodegenerative 
      disorders showed that the immune system, in particular the complement system, is 
      generally activated. We also demonstrate that HD mouse models mimic some aspects 
      of the disease very well, while others, e.g. the activation of the immune system 
      are inadequately reflected. CONCLUSION: Our analysis provides novel insights into 
      the molecular pathogenesis in HD and identifies genes and pathways as potential 
      therapeutic targets.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Using the R6/1 transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease (HD), 
      we have recently shown that acute administration with the dopamine-norepinephrine 
      reuptake inhibitor bupropion was able to rescue depressive-like behaviours in 
      female HD mice at 12weeks of age. OBJECTIVE: In this present study, we aimed to 
      further investigate the dopamine system as well as specifically measure dopamine 
      transporter (DAT) and D1 receptor function in female versus male R6/1 HD mice at 
      a very early stage of the disease. METHODS: We assessed the effects of acute 
      administration of bupropion and the dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF-8129 on 
      spontaneous locomotor activity in 8-week-old HD and wild-type (WT) mice. We also 
      measured dopamine levels in striatum via high performance liquid chromatography 
      (HPLC). RESULTS: We found that female (but not male) HD mice were hyposensitive 
      to bupropion when compared to WT littermates. However, both female and male HD 
      mice were less sensitive to SKF-81297 locomotor effects. We also found that 
      striatal dopamine levels and dopamine turnover were reduced in HD animals, 
      regardless of sex. CONCLUSION: Our present findings suggest that whereas only 
      female HD mice exhibit an impaired response to bupropion, dopamine D1 receptor 
      function is altered in both female and male HD animals. These data are the first 
      in vivo evidence of impaired dopamine D1 receptor-dependent function in pre-motor 
      symptomatic HD mice suggesting that this is a candidate target for early 
      therapeutic interventions.

TI  - 'Super-Enrichment' Reveals Dose-Dependent Therapeutic Effects of Environmental 
      Stimulation in a Transgenic Mouse Model of Huntington's Disease.
PG  - 299-309
LID - 10.3233/JHD-140118 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a tandem repeat expansion and 
      involves progressive cognitive decline, psychiatric abnormalities and motor 
      deficits. Disease onset and progression in HD mice can be substantially delayed 
      by a housing environment with enhanced sensorimotor and cognitive stimulation. 
      However, the proposed benefits of environmental enrichment (EE) are always taken 
      in the context of 'deprived' standard housing and investigation is warranted into 
      the graded effects of enrichment. OBJECTIVE: To assess if a higher level of 
      environmental stimulation ('super-enrichment') has additional benefits compared 
      to home-cage EE in HD mice. METHODS: One group of R6/1 transgenic HD mice and 
      wild-type (WT) littermates were home-cage enriched (EE group). A second group 
      also had enriched home cages, but from 6 weeks of age were exposed to a large 
      'super-enrichment' arena (SuperE group) three times per week. A range of motor 
      tests (open field, rotarod, clasping) were conducted from 8 weeks of age and, at 
      the end of the experiment, grip strength was assessed and post-mortem measures 
      were taken (brain weight, striatal volume, dopamine receptor activation and 
      aggregate density). RESULTS: SuperE improved the reduction of exploration in the 
      open field, ameliorated impaired grip strength in home-cage enriched HD mice and 
      delayed, but did not abolish, the onset of rear-paw clasping compared to EE. 
      SuperE increased brain weight compared to EE in HD mice and reduced striatal 
      dopamine D1 receptor agonist-induced c-fos expression, regardless of genotype. 
      Body weight, rotarod performance, aggregate formation and striatal volume in 
      SuperE groups were no different compared to EE groups. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      beneficial effects of sensorimotor and cognitive stimulation are graded and 
      extend beyond merely compensating for the deprivation of standard home cages in 
      specific motor-related phenotypes in HD. Our findings highlight the importance of 
      environmental enrichment quality and quantity and the translational value of 
      stimulating living conditions as experience-dependent modulators of pathogenesis 
      in HD and other brain disorders.

TI  - Huntingtin Supplies a csaA-Independent Function Essential for EDTA-Resistant 
      Homotypic Cell Adhesion in Dictyostelium discoideum.
PG  - 261-71
LID - 10.3233/JHD-140112 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The CAG triplet repeat expansion mutation in the HTT locus, which 
      results in neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease, elongates a polyglutamine 
      tract in huntingtin, a HEAT/HEAT-like protein that has been highly structurally 
      conserved through evolution. In several organisms, huntingtin is necessary for 
      proper cell-cell adhesion and normal development. OBJECTIVE: Dictyostelium 
      discoideum huntingtin null (htt-) cells display a variety of developmental 
      abnormalities and completely fail to acquire EDTA-resistant homotypic cell 
      adhesion during starvation in suspension culture. METHODS: Here, we have assessed 
      the hypothesis that htt may be a genetic interactor of csaA, a major regulator of 
      EDTA-resistant homotypic cell adhesion in D. discoideum. Immunoblot analysis 
      demonstrated that csaA protein expression is dysregulated in htt- cells. RESULTS: 
      Unexpectedly, csaA overexpression, previously shown to rescue csaA- cell 
      adhesion, failed to rescue the htt- adhesion defect. Thus, while htt was required 
      for proper expression of the csaA protein, csaA overexpression was not sufficient 
      to confer EDTA-resistant adhesion in the context of the htt- genetic background 
      in contrast to parental cells. This implies a novel role for htt in conferring 
      csaA-dependent, EDTA-resistant cell adhesion that warrants further investigation. 
      Calcium supplementation restored both endogenous csaA protein levels and 
      EDTA-resistant adhesion in htt- cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests the 
      existence of an additional mechanism that overcomes the EDTA-resistant adhesion 
      defect of htt- cells in the early development of D. discoideum.

      common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and/or frontotemporal 
      dementia in many populations, including the Greek. Recently, C9ORF72 expansions 
      were reported as the most common genetic cause of Huntington disease (HD) 
      phenocopies in a UK population. In the present study, we screened a selected 
      cohort of 40 Greek patients with HD phenocopies for C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat 
      expansions using repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction. We identified 2 
      patients (5%) with pathologic expansions. The first patient had chorea, 
      behavioral-psychiatric disturbance, cognitive impairment, and a positive family 
      history, fulfilling the strictest criteria for HD phenocopy. The second patient 
      was sporadic and had parkinsonism, behavioral-psychiatric disturbance, and 
      cognitive impairment, corresponding to a broader definition of HD phenocopy. 
      These findings identify C9ORF72 expansions as a frequent cause of HD phenocopies 
      in the Greek population, confirming recent findings in other populations and 
      supporting proposed diagnostic testing for C9ORF72 expansions in patients with 
      HD-like syndromes.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a CAG tandem repeat mutation encoding a polyglutamine tract expansion 
      in the huntingtin protein. Depression is among the most common affective symptoms 
      in HD but the pathophysiology is unclear. We have previously discovered sexually 
      dimorphic depressive-like behaviours in the R6/1 transgenic mouse model of HD at 
      a pre-motor symptomatic age. Interestingly, only female R6/1 mice display this 
      phenotype. Sexual dimorphism has not been explored in the human HD population 
      despite the well-established knowledge that the clinical depression rate in 
      females is almost twice that of males. Female susceptibility suggests a role of 
      sex hormones, which have been shown to modulate stress response. There is 
      evidence suggesting that the gonads are adversely affected in HD patients, which 
      could alter sex hormone levels. The present study examined the role sex hormones 
      play on stress response in the R6/1 mouse model of HD, in particular, its 
      modulatory effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and 
      depression-like behaviour. We found that the gonads of female R6/1 mice show 
      atrophy at an early age. Expression levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone 
      (GnRH) were decreased in the hypothalamus of female HD mice, relative to 
      wild-type female littermates, as were serum testosterone levels. Female serum 
      estradiol levels were not significantly changed. Gonadectomy surgery reduced 
      HPA-axis activity in female mice but had no effect on behavioural phenotypes. 
      Furthermore, expression of the oestrogen receptor (ER) alpha gene was found to be 
      higher in the adrenal cells of female HD mice. Finally, administration of an ERbeta 
      agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN) rescued depressive-like behaviour in the female 
      HD mice. Our findings provide new insight into the pathogenesis of sexually 
      dimorphic neuroendocrine, physiological and behavioural endophenotypes in HD, and 
      suggest a new avenue for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited, fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused 
      by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. The mutant protein causes 
      neuronal dysfunction and degeneration resulting in motor dysfunction, cognitive 
      decline, and psychiatric disturbances. Currently, there is no disease altering 
      treatment, and symptomatic therapy has limited benefit. The pathogenesis of HD is 
      complicated and multiple pathways are compromised. Addressing the problem at its 
      genetic root by suppressing mutant huntingtin expression is a promising 
      therapeutic strategy for HD. We have developed and evaluated antisense 
      oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting single nucleotide polymorphisms that are 
      significantly enriched on HD alleles (HD-SNPs). We describe our 
      structure-activity relationship studies for ASO design and find that adjusting 
      the SNP position within the gap, chemical modifications of the wings, and 
      shortening the unmodified gap are critical for potent, specific, and well 
      tolerated silencing of mutant huntingtin. Finally, we show that using two 
      distinct ASO drugs targeting the two allelic variants of an HD-SNP could provide 
      a therapeutic option for all persons with HD; allele-specifically for roughly 
      half, and non-specifically for the remainder.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by CGG repeat expansion that leads to FMR1 
      silencing. Women with a premutation allele are at risk of having a full mutation 
      child with FXS. To investigate the mechanism of repeat expansion, we examined the 
      relationship between a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant that is 
      linked to repeat expansion in haplogroup D and a replication origin located  approximately 53 
      kb upstream of the repeats. This origin is absent in FXS human embryonic stem 
      cells (hESCs), which have the SNP variant C, but present in the nonaffected 
      hESCs, which have a T variant. The SNP maps directly within the replication 
      origin. Interestingly, premutation hESCs have a replication origin and the T 
      variant similar to nonaffected hESCs. These results suggest that a T/C SNP 
      located at a replication origin could contribute to the inactivation of this 
      replication origin in FXS hESCs, leading to altered replication fork progression 
      through the repeats, which could result in repeat expansion to the FXS full 
      mutation.

AB  - The California National Primate Research Center maintains a small colony of titi 
      monkeys (Callicebus cupreus) for behavioral studies. While short tandem repeat 
      (STR) markers are critical for the genetic management of the center's rhesus 
      macaque (Macaca mulatta) breeding colony, STRs are not used for this purpose in 
      the maintenance of the center's titi monkey colony. Consequently, the genetic 
      structure of this titi monkey population has not been characterized. A lack of 
      highly informative genetic markers in titi monkeys has also resulted in scant 
      knowledge of the species' genetic variation in the wild. The purpose of this 
      study was to develop a panel of highly polymorphic titi monkey STRs using a 
      cross-species polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification protocol that could 
      be used for the genetic management of the titi monkey colony. We screened 16 STR 
      primer pairs and selected those that generated robust and reproducible 
      polymorphic amplicons. Loci that were found to be highly polymorphic, very likely 
      to be useful for parentage verification, pedigree assessment, and studying titi 
      monkey population genetics, were validated using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and 
      linkage disequilibrium analyses. The genetic data generated in this study were 
      also used to assess directly the impact on the colony's genetic diversity of a 
      recent adenovirus outbreak. While the adenovirus epizootic disease caused 
      significant mortality (19 deaths among the 65 colony animals), our results 
      suggest that the disease exhibited little or no influence on the overall genetic 
      diversity of the colony.

LID - 260
AB  - Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) is due to an X-linked 
      mutation that results from the expansion of a CGG repeat sequence located in the 
      5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene (premutation, PM). About 20% of women who 
      carry the PM have cessation of menses before age 40, a clinical condition known 
      as premature ovarian failure (POF). This leads to a 20-fold increased risk over 
      women in the general population. Thus, this single gene mutation has a major 
      effect on reducing a woman's reproductive life span. Based on survival analysis 
      of about 1300 women, we showed that the mean age at menopause among PM carriers 
      is reduced compared with noncarriers, even after removing women who reported POF. 
      This suggests that the majority of women with the PM, not just a subset, 
      experience ovarian insufficiency earlier than noncarriers. To better understand 
      the underlying mechanism of the PM and to identify genes that modify the variable 
      expressivity of FXPOI, we conducted two pilot studies. The first focused on five 
      common variants known to reduce age at menopause. We genotyped these SNPs in 72 
      women with a PM who experienced menopause and found a significant association 
      with the total SNP risk burden and age at menopause. This suggests that these 
      SNPs influence onset of FXPOI, after adjusting for the effect of the PM allele. 
      In the second approach, we conducted whole genome sequencing on 10 PM carriers, 
      five with onset of FXPOI prior to age 30 and five who experienced menopause after 
      age 47 years. Although only a pilot study, we describe our preliminary approach 
      to identify potential variants that may play a role in modifying onset of FXPOI 
      and potentially play a role in idiopathic primary ovarian insufficiency. The 
      overarching goal of both approaches is to identify predictor variants that may 
      identify women predisposed to early onset FXPOI and to further identify genes 
      involved in defining a woman's reproductive life span.

PG  - 1280-4

AB  - Transient DNA breaks and evidence of DNA damage response have recently been 
      reported during the chromatin remodeling process in haploid spermatids, creating 
      a potential window of enhanced genetic instability. We used flow cytometry to 
      achieve separation of differentiating spermatids into four highly purified 
      populations using transgenic mice harboring 160 CAG repeats within exon 1 of the 
      human Huntington disease gene (HTT). Trinucleotic repeat expansion was found to 
      occur immediately following the chromatin remodeling steps, confirming the 
      genetic instability of the process and pointing to the origin of paternal 
      anticipation observed in some trinucleotidic repeats diseases.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disorder 
      with cognitive, psychiatric, motor, neuroendocrine and peripheral dysfunctions. 
      Symptom onset and progression can be closely modeled in HD transgenic mice, which 
      facilitate the search for therapeutics and environmental modulators. In the first 
      investigation of chronic stress in HD, we have previously shown that 
      administering a moderate dose of the stress hormone, corticosterone (CORT) had no 
      effect on short-term memory in wildtype (WT) mice but accelerated the onset of 
      the impairment in male R6/1 HD mice. We now extend this investigation to 
      ethological dysfunctions in HD, which we hypothesized to be more susceptible to 
      CORT treatment compared to the same functions in WT littermates. Both genotypes 
      consumed similar doses of CORT dissolved in drinking water across 6-14 weeks of 
      age and were assessed for olfactory sensitivity, nest-building, saccharin 
      preference as well as vocal responses to sociosexual stimuli. In female HD and WT 
      mice, olfactory sensitivity and saccharin preference were reduced by 2 and 4 
      weeks of CORT, respectively. In males, there was no effect of CORT on saccharin 
      preference, however the number of vocalizations to a female mouse was transiently 
      increased by CORT-drinking, regardless of genotype. Nest-building was severely 
      impaired in HD mice at an early age, but was unaffected by CORT. Our results 
      suggest that the presence of the HD mutation had no bearing on CORT-induced 
      effects at this dose, suggesting that even moderately elevated stress hormone 
      levels can impair ethological behaviors in both the HD and healthy brain.

TI  - BDNF and Huntingtin protein modifications by manganese: implications for striatal 
      medium spiny neuron pathology in manganese neurotoxicity.
PG  - 655-66
LID - 10.1111/jnc.12926 [doi]
AB  - High levels of manganese (Mn) exposure decrease striatal medium spiny neuron 
      (MSN) dendritic length and spine density, but the mechanism(s) are not known. The 
      Huntingtin (HTT) gene has been functionally linked to cortical brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) support of striatal MSNs via phosphorylation at serine 
      421. In Huntington's disease, pathogenic CAG repeat expansions of HTT decrease 
      synthesis and disrupt transport of cortical-striatal BDNF, which may contribute 
      to disease, and Mn is a putative environmental modifier of Huntington's disease 
      pathology. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that changes in MSN dendritic 
      morphology Mn due to exposure are associated with decreased BDNF levels and 
      alterations in Htt protein. We report that BDNF levels are decreased in the 
      striatum of Mn-exposed non-human primates and in the cerebral cortex and striatum 
      of mice exposed to Mn. Furthermore, proBDNF and mature BDNF concentrations in 
      primary cortical and hippocampal neuron cultures were decreased by exposure to Mn 
      confirming the in vivo findings. Mn exposure decreased serine 421 phosphorylation 
      of Htt in cortical and hippocampal neurons and increased total Htt levels. These 
      data strongly support the hypothesis that Mn-exposure-related MSN pathology is 
      associated with decreased BDNF trophic support via alterations in Htt.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a tandem 
      repeat mutation encoding an expanded polyglutamine tract. Our previous work 
      showed that memory deficits in HD transgenic mice could be accelerated by 
      increased levels of stress hormone, while memory in WT mice remained unaffected. 
      HD patients experience higher levels of stress compared to the general population 
      and symptoms of HD also include motor, cognitive, psychiatric, sexual and 
      olfactory abnormalities, and an associated decline in activities of daily living. 
      Therefore we investigated the impact of a robust stressor (i.e. restraint) on the 
      onset and progression of a range of behavioral phenotypes in R6/1 transgenic HD 
      mice. Restraint was administered for 1h daily from 6weeks of age and continued 
      until R6/1 mice were clearly motor symptomatic at 14weeks of age. Serum 
      corticosterone levels in both R6/1 and WT littermates were elevated immediately 
      after the last restraint session and weight gain was suppressed in restrained 
      animals throughout the treatment period. Motor coordination and locomotor 
      activity were enhanced by chronic restraint in males, regardless of genotype. 
      However, there was no effect of restraint on motor performances in female 
      animals. At 8weeks of age, olfactory sensitivity was impaired by restraint in 
      R6/1 HD female mice, but not in WT mice. In male R6/1 mice, the olfactory deficit 
      was exacerbated by restraint and olfaction was also impaired in male WT mice. The 
      development of deficits in saccharin preference, Y-maze memory, nest-building and 
      sexually-motivated vocalizations was unaffected by chronic restraint in R6/1 and 
      had little impact on such behavioral performances in WT animals. We provide 
      evidence that chronic stress can negatively modulate specific endophenotypes in 
      HD mice, while the same functions were affected to a lesser extent in WT mice. 
      This vulnerability in HD animals seems to be sex-specific depending on the stress 
      paradigm used. It is hoped that our work will stimulate clinical investigations 
      into the effects of stress on both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic gene-positive 
      members of HD families, and inform the development of new therapeutic approaches.

TI  - The co-occurrence of Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease: a 
      neuropathological study of 15 elderly Huntington's disease subjects.
PG  - 209-17
LID - 10.3233/JHD-140111 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dementia is a common feature in both Huntington's disease (HD) and 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as in the general elderly population. Few 
      studies have examined elderly HD patients with dementia for neuropathologic 
      evidence of both HD and AD. OBJECTIVE: We present neuropathological findings in a 
      retrospective case series of 15 elderly HD patients (ages 60-91 years), 11 of 
      whom had prominent clinical dementia. METHODS: Post-mortem brain tissue was 
      examined and stained for evidence of both HD and AD including Vonsattel grading 
      and Htt-repeat expansion, Bielskowsky, tau, beta amyloid, and TDP43 immunostaining. 
      RESULTS: Mean age at death was 76.8 years, mean disease duration was 18.6 years, 
      and mean CAG repeat expansion was 42. Evidence of AD in addition to HD pathology 
      was present in 9 of 11 (82%) patients with prominent dementia, suggesting that AD 
      may be more commonly co-occurring with HD than previously appreciated. Two 
      patients had only HD as the basis of dementia and four patients did not have 
      prominent dementia. One patient with marked parkinsonian features was not L-dopa 
      responsive and had no substantia nigra Lewy bodies at autopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      study suggests that AD may frequently contribute to cognitive decline in elderly 
      HD patients which complicates the assessment and management of such individuals. 
      Further study is needed to determine if there is a higher incidence of AD in 
      persons with HD compared to the general population. In addition, our series 
      includes one HD patient whose clinical features masqueraded as Parkinson's 
      disease but was not responsive to levodopa therapy.

TI  - Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers suppress mutant huntingtin expression and 
      attenuate neurotoxicity.
PG  - 6302-17
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddu349 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Disease pathogenesis 
      derives, at least in part, from the long polyglutamine tract encoded by mutant 
      HTT. Therefore, considerable effort has been dedicated to the development of 
      therapeutic strategies that significantly reduce the expression of the mutant HTT 
      protein. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeted to the CAG repeat region of 
      HTT transcripts have been of particular interest due to their potential capacity 
      to discriminate between normal and mutant HTT transcripts. Here, we focus on 
      phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs), ASOs that are especially stable, 
      highly soluble and non-toxic. We designed three PMOs to selectively target 
      expanded CAG repeat tracts (CTG22, CTG25 and CTG28), and two PMOs to selectively 
      target sequences flanking the HTT CAG repeat (HTTex1a and HTTex1b). In HD 
      patient-derived fibroblasts with expanded alleles containing 44, 77 or 109 CAG 
      repeats, HTTex1a and HTTex1b were effective in suppressing the expression of 
      mutant and non-mutant transcripts. CTGn PMOs also suppressed HTT expression, with 
      the extent of suppression and the specificity for mutant transcripts dependent on 
      the length of the targeted CAG repeat and on the CTG repeat length and 
      concentration of the PMO. PMO CTG25 reduced HTT-induced cytotoxicity in vitro and 
      suppressed mutant HTT expression in vivo in the N171-82Q transgenic mouse model. 
      Finally, CTG28 reduced mutant HTT expression and improved the phenotype of 
      Hdh(Q7/Q150) knock-in HD mice. These data demonstrate the potential of PMOs as an 
      approach to suppressing the expression of mutant HTT.

TI  - A clinical classification acknowledging neuropsychiatric and cognitive impairment 
      in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 114
LID - 10.1186/s13023-014-0114-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Involuntary movements, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and cognitive 
      impairment are all part of the symptom triad in Huntington's disease (HD). 
      Despite the fact that neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive decline may be 
      early manifestations of HD, the clinical diagnosis is conventionally based on the 
      presence of involuntary movements and a positive genetic test for the HD CAG 
      repeat expansion. After investigating the frequencies of the triad manifestations 
      in a large outpatient clinical cohort of HD gene-expansion carriers, we propose a 
      new clinical classification. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 107 
      gene-expansion carriers from a Danish outpatient clinic were recruited. All 
      participants underwent neurological examination, psychiatric evaluation and 
      neuropsychological testing. Participants were categorised according to motor 
      symptoms, neuropsychiatric symptoms, the use of psychotropic medication, and 
      cognitive impairment. RESULTS: Among the motor manifest HD gene-expansion 
      carriers, 51.8% presented with the full symptom triad, 25.0% were defined as 
      cognitively impaired in addition to motor symptoms, and 14.3% had 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms along with motor symptoms. Only 8.9% had isolated motor 
      symptoms. Among gene-expansion carriers without motor symptoms, 39.2% had 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms, were cognitively impaired, or had a combination of the 
      two. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report the frequencies of both motor 
      symptoms, cognitive impairment, and neuropsychiatric symptoms in HD 
      gene-expansion carriers in a national outpatient HD clinical cohort. We found 
      that almost 40% of the gene-expansion carriers without motor symptoms had either 
      neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairment or both, emphasising that these 
      patients are not premanifest in psychiatric and cognitive terms, suggesting that 
      the current clinical classification is neither necessarily suitable nor helpful 
      for this patient group. Some premanifest gene-expansion carriers may have 
      psychiatric and/or cognitive symptoms caused by reactive stress or other 
      pathology than HD. Acknowledging this fact we, however, suggest classifying all 
      HD gene-expansion carriers into three clinical categories: premanifest, non-motor 
      manifest, and motor manifest.

      Premutation Carriers.
PG  - 227-239
LID - 10.2217/fnl.14.11 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X-associated disorders (FXD) are a group of disorders caused by expansion 
      of non-coding CGG repeat elements in the fragile X (FMR1) gene. One of these 
      disorders, fragile X syndrome (FXS), is the most common heritable cause of 
      intellectual disability, and is caused by large CGG repeat expansions (>200) 
      resulting in silencing of the FMR1 gene. An increasingly recognized number of 
      neuropsychiatric FXD have recently been identified that are caused by 
      'premutation' range expansions (55-200). These disorders are characterized by a 
      spectrum of neuropsychiatric manifestations ranging from an increased risk of 
      neurodevelopmental, mood and anxiety disorders to neurodegenerative phenotypes 
      such as the fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Here, we review 
      advances in the clinical understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders in 
      premutation carriers across the lifespan and offer guidance for the detection of 
      such disorders by practicing psychiatrists and neurologists.

TI  - Modulation of the age at onset in spinocerebellar ataxia by CAG tracts in various 
      genes.
PG  - 2444-55
LID - 10.1093/brain/awu174 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine-coding (CAG)n repeat expansions in seven different genes cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxias. Although the size of the expansion is negatively 
      correlated with age at onset, it accounts for only 50-70% of its variability. To 
      find other factors involved in this variability, we performed a regression 
      analysis in 1255 affected individuals with identified expansions (spinocerebellar 
      ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7), recruited through the European Consortium on 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxias, to determine whether age at onset is influenced by the 
      size of the normal allele in eight causal (CAG)n-containing genes (ATXN1-3, 6-7, 
      17, ATN1 and HTT). We confirmed the negative effect of the expanded allele and 
      detected threshold effects reflected by a quadratic association between age at 
      onset and CAG size in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 3 and 6. We also evidenced 
      an interaction between the expanded and normal alleles in trans in individuals 
      with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 6 and 7. Except for individuals with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, age at onset was also influenced by other 
      (CAG)n-containing genes: ATXN7 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2; ATXN2, ATN1 and 
      HTT in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3; ATXN1 and ATXN3 in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 6; and ATXN3 and TBP in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7. This suggests that 
      there are biological relationships among these genes. The results were partially 
      replicated in four independent populations representing 460 Caucasians and 216 
      Asian samples; the differences are possibly explained by ethnic or geographical 
      differences. As the variability in age at onset is not completely explained by 
      the effects of the causative and modifier sister genes, other genetic or 
      environmental factors must also play a role in these diseases.

TI  - Ubiquitin-specific protease-14 reduces cellular aggregates and protects against 
      mutant huntingtin-induced cell degeneration: involvement of the proteasome and ER 
      stress-activated kinase IRE1alpha.
PG  - 5928-39
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddu317 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal inherited neurological disease caused 
      by a CAG-repeat expansion in the first exon of huntingtin gene encoding for the 
      huntingtin protein (Htt). In HD, there is an accumulation of intracellular 
      aggregates of mutant Htt that negatively influence cellular functions. The 
      aggregates contain ubiquitin, and part of the HD pathophysiology could result 
      from an imbalance in cellular ubiquitin levels. Deubiquitinating enzymes are 
      important for replenishing the ubiquitin pool, but less is known about their 
      roles in brain diseases. We show here that overexpression of the 
      ubiquitin-specific protease-14 (Usp14) reduces cellular aggregates in mutant 
      Htt-expressing cells mainly via the ubiquitin proteasome system. We also observed 
      that the serine-threonine kinase IRE1 involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
      stress responses is activated in mutant Htt-expressing cells in culture as well 
      as in the striatum of mutant Htt transgenic (BACHD) mice. Usp14 interacted with 
      IRE1 in control cells but less in mutant Htt-expressing cells. Overexpression of 
      Usp14 in turn was able to inhibit phosphorylation of IRE1alpha in mutant 
      Htt-overexpressing cells and to protect against cell degeneration and caspase-3 
      activation. These results show that ER stress-mediated IRE1 activation is part of 
      mutant Htt toxicity and that this is counteracted by Usp14 expression. Usp14 
      effectively reduced cellular aggregates and counteracted cell degeneration 
      indicating an important role of this protein in mutant Htt-induced cell toxicity.

TI  - Impaired brain energy metabolism in the BACHD mouse model of Huntington's 
      disease: critical role of astrocyte-neuron interactions.
PG  - 1500-10
LID - 10.1038/jcbfm.2014.110 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat 
      expansions in the huntingtin (Htt) gene. Although early energy metabolic 
      alterations in HD are likely to contribute to later neurodegenerative processes, 
      the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for these metabolic alterations 
      are not well characterized. Using the BACHD mice that express the full-length 
      mutant huntingtin (mHtt) protein with 97 glutamine repeats, we first demonstrated 
      localized in vivo changes in brain glucose use reminiscent of what is observed in 
      premanifest HD carriers. Using biochemical, molecular, and functional analyses on 
      different primary cell culture models from BACHD mice, we observed that mHtt does 
      not directly affect metabolic activity in a cell autonomous manner. However, 
      coculture of neurons with astrocytes from wild-type or BACHD mice identified 
      mutant astrocytes as a source of adverse non-cell autonomous effects on neuron 
      energy metabolism possibly by increasing oxidative stress. These results suggest 
      that astrocyte-to-neuron signaling is involved in early energy metabolic 
      alterations in HD.

AB  - We tested for the association of HTR1A and 5-HTT genetic polymorphisms with 
      treatment response to mirtazapine and evaluated the interactive effect between 
      the polymorphisms in 283 patients with major depressive disorder. Korean subjects 
      with diagnosis of major depressive disorder using the Structured Clinical 
      Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth 
      Edition Axis I disorders were recruited. Clinical symptoms were evaluated using 
      the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating (HAMD-17) Scale at baseline and after 1, 
      2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment with mirtazapine. The genetic association of 
      5-HTTLPR and HTR1A+272G>A with treatment response was analyzed. We found a 
      significant association of the 12.12-repeat genotype of 5-HTT various number 
      tandem repeat (VNTR) with a large percentage decline in HAMD-17 Scale score after 
      4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment with mirtazapine. We also found that the 
      frequency of the 12.12-repeat genotype was higher in responders than in 
      nonresponders at week 8. The HTR1A+272GG genotype was significantly associated 
      with a large percentage decline in HAMD-17 Scale score at 4, 8, and 12 weeks, 
      although the genotypic frequencies were comparable between responders and 
      nonresponders during the study period. Patients with the 12.12-repeat 5-HTT VNTR 
      and GG of HTR1A+272G>A showed the highest HAMD-17 Scale percentage reduction 
      during the study period and a better treatment response status after 4 weeks. 
      These results suggest that the interaction between HTR1A+272G>A and 5-HTT VNTR is 
      involved in the response to mirtazapine treatment and that a combination of these 
      may be a useful marker for predicting treatment response to mirtazapine.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
      polyglutamine repeat expansion in the huntingtin protein. Mitochondrial 
      dysfunction associated with energy failure plays an important role in this 
      untreated pathology. In the present work, we used lymphoblasts obtained from HD 
      patients or unaffected parentally related individuals to study the protective 
      role of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) versus insulin (at low nM) on 
      signaling and metabolic and mitochondrial functions. Deregulation of 
      intracellular signaling pathways linked to activation of insulin and IGF-1 
      receptors (IR,IGF-1R), Akt, and ERK was largely restored by IGF-1 and, at a less 
      extent, by insulin in HD human lymphoblasts. Importantly, both neurotrophic 
      factors stimulated huntingtin phosphorylation at Ser421 in HD cells. IGF-1 and 
      insulin also rescued energy levels in HD peripheral cells, as evaluated by 
      increased ATP and phosphocreatine, and decreased lactate levels. Moreover, IGF-1 
      effectively ameliorated O2 consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) 
      in HD lymphoblasts, which occurred concomitantly with increased levels of 
      cytochrome c. Indeed, constitutive phosphorylation of huntingtin was able to 
      restore the Deltapsim in lymphoblasts expressing an abnormal expansion of 
      polyglutamines. HD lymphoblasts further exhibited increased intracellular Ca(2+) 
      levels before and after exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and decreased 
      mitochondrial Ca(2+) accumulation, being the later recovered by IGF-1 and insulin 
      in HD lymphoblasts pre-exposed to H2O2. In summary, the data support an important 
      role for IR/IGF-1R mediated activation of signaling pathways and improved 
      mitochondrial and metabolic function in HD human lymphoblasts.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a tandem 
      repeat mutation in the huntingtin gene. Lifestyle factors, such as lack of 
      activity may contribute to the variability in the age of disease onset. 
      Therefore, better understanding of environmental modifiers may uncover potential 
      therapeutic approaches to delay disease onset and progression. Recent data 
      suggest that HD patients and transgenic mouse models show a dysregulated stress 
      response. In this present study, we elevated stress hormone levels through oral 
      corticosterone (CORT) treatment and assessed its impact on the development of 
      motor impairment and cognitive deficits using the R6/1 transgenic mouse model of 
      HD. We found that CORT consumption did not alter rotarod performance of R6/1 HD 
      or wild-type (WT) littermates. However, the onset of hippocampal-dependent Y-maze 
      deficits was accelerated in male R6/1 mice by 5days of CORT treatment, whereas 
      short term memory of WT and female R6/1 mice was unaffected. We then further 
      investigated the male HD susceptibility to CORT by measuring TrkB activation, 
      BDNF and glucocorticoid receptor expression as well as the level of cell 
      proliferation in the hippocampus. CORT treatment increased the levels of 
      phosphorylated TrkB in male R6/1 mice only. There were no effects of CORT on 
      hippocampal BDNF protein or mRNA levels; nor on expression of the glucocorticoid 
      receptors in any group. Hippocampal cell proliferation was decreased in male R6/1 
      mice and this was further reduced in CORT-drinking male R6/1 mice. Female mice 
      (WT and R6/1) appeared to be protected from the impacts of CORT treatment in all 
      our hippocampal measures. Overall, our data demonstrate that treatment with 
      corticosterone is able to modulate the onset of HD symptomatology. We present the 
      first evidence of a male-specific vulnerability to stress impacting on the 
      development of short-term memory deficits in HD. More generally, we found that 
      female mice were protected from the detrimental effects of CORT treatment on a 
      variety of hippocampus-based measures. Hippocampal plasticity and memory in HD 
      may be more susceptible to the impacts of stress in a sex-dependent manner. We 
      propose clinical investigations of stress as a key environmental modifier of HD 
      symptom onset.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a severe neurodegenerative 
      disorder that affects carriers of premutation CGG-repeat expansion alleles of the 
      fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene; current evidence supports a causal 
      role of the expanded CGG repeat within the FMR1 mRNA in the pathogenesis of 
      FXTAS. Though the mRNA has been observed to induce cellular toxicity in FXTAS, 
      the mechanisms are unclear. One common neurophysiological characteristic of FXTAS 
      patients is their inability to properly attenuate their response to an auditory 
      stimulus upon receipt of a small pre-stimulus. Therefore, to gain genetic and 
      cell biological insight into FXTAS, we examined the effect of expanded CGG 
      repeats on the plasticity of the olfactory response of the genetically tractable 
      nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). While C. elegans is innately 
      attracted to odors, this response can be downregulated if the odor is paired with 
      starvation. We found that expressing expanded CGG repeats in olfactory neurons 
      interfered with this plasticity without affecting either the innate odor-seeking 
      response or the olfactory neuronal morphology. Interrogation of three RNA 
      regulatory pathways indicated that the expanded CGG repeats act via the C. 
      elegans microRNA (miRNA)-specific Argonaute ALG-2 to diminish olfactory 
      plasticity. This observation suggests that the miRNA-Argonaute pathway may play a 
      pathogenic role in subverting neuronal function in FXTAS.

AB  - The human genome segment upstream of the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) 
      gene (Xq27.3) contains several genetic signals, among them is a DNA methylation 
      boundary that is located 65-70 CpGs upstream of the CGG repeat. In fragile X 
      syndrome (FXS), the boundary is lost, and the promoter is inactivated by 
      methylation spreading. Here we document boundary stability in spite of critical 
      expansions of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in male or female premutation carriers 
      and in high functioning males (HFMs). HFMs carry a full CGG repeat expansion but 
      exhibit an unmethylated promoter and lack the FXS phenotype. The boundary is also 
      stable in Turner (45, X) females. A CTCF-binding site is located slightly 
      upstream of the methylation boundary and carries a unique G-to-A polymorphism 
      (single nucleotide polymorphism), which occurs 3.6 times more frequently in 
      genomes with CGG expansions. The increased frequency of this single nucleotide 
      polymorphism might have functional significance. In CGG expansions, the CTCF 
      region does not harbor additional mutations. In FXS individuals and often in 
      cells transgenomic for EBV (Epstein Barr Virus) DNA or for the telomerase gene, 
      the large number of normally methylated CpGs in the far-upstream region of the 
      boundary is decreased about 4-fold. A methylation boundary is also present in the 
      human genome segment upstream of the HTT (huntingtin) promoter (4p16.3) and is 
      stable both in normal and Huntington disease chromosomes. Hence, the vicinity of 
      an expanded repeat does not per se compromise methylation boundaries. Methylation 
      boundaries exert an important function as promoter safeguards.

TI  - Mammalian TBX1 preferentially binds and regulates downstream targets via a tandem

AB  - Haploinsufficiency or mutation of TBX1 is largely responsible for the etiology of 
      physical malformations in individuals with velo-cardio-facial/DiGeorge syndrome 
      (VCFS/DGS/22q11.2 deletion syndrome). TBX1 encodes a transcription factor protein 
      that contains an evolutionarily conserved DNA binding domain termed the T-box 
      that is shared with other family members. All T-box proteins, examined so far, 
      bind to similar but not identical consensus DNA sequences, indicating that they 
      have specific binding preferences. To identify the TBX1 specific consensus 
      sequence, Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) was 
      performed. In contrast to other TBX family members recognizing palindrome 
      sequences, we found that TBX1 preferentially binds to a tandem repeat of 
      5'-AGGTGTGAAGGTGTGA-3'. We also identified a second consensus sequence comprised 
      of a tandem repeat with a degenerated downstream site. We show that three known 
      human disease-causing TBX1 missense mutations (F148Y, H194Q and G310S) do not 
      alter nuclear localization, or disrupt binding to the tandem repeat consensus 
      sequences, but they reduce transcriptional activity in cell culture reporter 
      assays. To identify Tbx1-downstream genes, we performed an in silico genome wide 
      analysis of potential cis-acting elements in DNA and found strong enrichment of 
      genes required for developmental processes and transcriptional regulation. We 
      found that TBX1 binds to 19 different loci in vitro, which may correspond to 
      putative cis-acting binding sites. In situ hybridization coupled with luciferase 
      gene reporter assays on three gene loci, Fgf8, Bmper, Otog-MyoD, show that these 
      motifs are directly regulated by TBX1 in vitro. Collectively, the present studies 
      establish new insights into molecular aspects of TBX1 binding to DNA. This work 
      lays the groundwork for future in vivo studies, including chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to further 
      elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of VCFS/DGS.

TI  - Biodegradable delivery system containing a peptide inhibitor of polyglutamine 
      aggregation: a step toward therapeutic development in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 630-9
LID - 10.1002/psc.2640 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's and eight other neurodegenerative diseases occur because of CAG 
      repeat expansion mutation culminating into an expanded polyglutamine tract in 
      respective protein. In Huntington's disease (HD), a number of CAG repeats beyond 
      normal repeat length (>36) lead to the formation of mutant protein, the 
      proteolytic cleavage of which induces aggregation in polyglutamine 
      length-dependent manner. The neurodegeneration in this disease is linked to 
      aggregation, and its inhibition is a potential approach for therapeutic 
      development. Although peptides and other molecules have been developed for 
      inhibiting aggregation, peptides in general are susceptible to degradation in 
      vivo conditions. To understand their clinical significance, they also need to be 
      delivered through blood-brain barrier. Here, for the first time, we have 
      synthesized poly-d,l-lactide-co-glycolide nanoparticles containing a 
      polyglutamine aggregation inhibitor peptide PGQ9 [P(2) ], by nanoprecipitation 
      method. This process yielded less than 200 nm spherical nanoparticles with 
      uniform distribution. Characterization studies by infrared spectroscopy-based and 
      HPLC-based assays show the presence of PGQ9 [P(2) ] in nanoparticles. In vitro 
      release kinetics demonstrates that nanoparticles release PGQ9 [P(2) ] by erosion 
      and diffusion processes. When the PGQ9 [P(2) ]-loaded nanoparticles are incubated 
      with aggregation-prone Q35 P10 peptide, representing N-terminal part of 
      Huntingtin protein, it arrests the elongation phase of Q35 P10 aggregation. These 
      findings propose the first step toward delivery of a peptide inhibitor against 
      polyglutamine aggregation in HD.

TI  - Neuronal targets for reducing mutant huntingtin expression to ameliorate disease 
      in a mouse model of Huntington's disease.
PG  - 536-41
LID - 10.1038/nm.3514 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion leading to an elongated polyglutamine 
      stretch in huntingtin. Mutant huntingtin (mHTT) is ubiquitously expressed in all 
      cells but elicits selective cortical and striatal neurodegeneration in HD. The 
      mechanistic basis for such selective neuronal vulnerability remains unclear. A 
      necessary step toward resolving this enigma is to define the cell types in which 
      mHTT expression is causally linked to the disease pathogenesis. Using a 
      conditional transgenic mouse model of HD, in which the mice express full-length 
      human mHTT from a bacterial artificial chromosome transgene (BACHD), we 
      genetically reduced mHTT expression in neuronal populations in the striatum, 
      cortex or both. We show that reduction of cortical mHTT expression in BACHD mice 
      partially improves motor and psychiatric-like behavioral deficits but does not 
      improve neurodegeneration, whereas reduction of mHTT expression in both neuronal 
      populations consistently ameliorates all behavioral deficits and selective brain 
      atrophy in this HD model. Furthermore, whereas reduction of mHTT expression in 
      cortical or striatal neurons partially ameliorates corticostriatal synaptic 
      deficits, further restoration of striatal synaptic function can be achieved by 
      reduction of mHTT expression in both neuronal cell types. Our study demonstrates 
      distinct but interacting roles of cortical and striatal mHTT in HD pathogenesis 
      and suggests that optimal HD therapeutics may require targeting mHTT in both 
      cortical and striatal neurons.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The length of the huntingtin (HTT) CAG repeat is strongly correlated 
      with both age at onset of Huntington's disease (HD) symptoms and age at death of 
      HD patients. Dichotomous analysis comparing HD to controls is widely used to 
      study the effects of HTT CAG repeat expansion. However, a potentially more 
      powerful approach is a continuous analysis strategy that takes advantage of all 
      of the different CAG lengths, to capture effects that are expected to be critical 
      to HD pathogenesis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used continuous and 
      dichotomous approaches to analyze microarray gene expression data from 107 human 
      control and HD lymphoblastoid cell lines. Of all probes found to be significant 
      in a continuous analysis by CAG length, only 21.4% were so identified by a 
      dichotomous comparison of HD versus controls. Moreover, of probes significant by 
      dichotomous analysis, only 33.2% were also significant in the continuous 
      analysis. Simulations revealed that the dichotomous approach would require 
      substantially more than 107 samples to either detect 80% of the CAG-length 
      correlated changes revealed by continuous analysis or to reduce the rate of 
      significant differences that are not CAG length-correlated to 20% (n = 133 or 
      n = 206, respectively). Given the superior power of the continuous approach, we 
      calculated the correlation structure between HTT CAG repeat lengths and gene 
      expression levels and created a freely available searchable website, "HD 
      CAGnome," that allows users to examine continuous relationships between HTT CAG 
      and expression levels of  approximately 20,000 human genes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our 
      results reveal limitations of dichotomous approaches compared to the power of 
      continuous analysis to study a disease where human genotype-phenotype 
      relationships strongly support a role for a continuum of CAG length-dependent 
      changes. The compendium of HTT CAG length-gene expression level relationships 
      found at the HD CAGnome now provides convenient routes for discovery of 
      candidates influenced by the HD mutation.

AB  - Expansion of a trinucleotide (CGG) repeat element within the 5' untranslated 
      region (5'UTR) of the human FMR1 gene is responsible for a number of heritable 
      disorders operating through distinct pathogenic mechanisms: gene silencing for 
      fragile X syndrome (>200 CGG) and RNA toxic gain-of-function for FXTAS ( approximately  55-200 
      CGG). Existing models have focused almost exclusively on post-transcriptional 
      mechanisms, but co-transcriptional processes could also contribute to the 
      molecular dysfunction of FMR1. We have observed that transcription through the 
      GC-rich FMR1 5'UTR region favors R-loop formation, with the nascent (G-rich) RNA 
      forming a stable RNA:DNA hybrid with the template DNA strand, thereby displacing 
      the non-template DNA strand. Using DNA:RNA (hybrid) immunoprecipitation (DRIP) of 
      genomic DNA from cultured human dermal fibroblasts with both normal ( approximately  30 CGG 
      repeats) and premutation (55<CGG<200 repeats) alleles, we provide evidence for 
      FMR1 R-loop formation in human genomic DNA. Using a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible 
      episomal system in which both the CGG-repeat and transcription frequency can be 
      varied, we further show that R-loop formation increases with higher expression 
      levels. Finally, non-denaturing bisulfite mapping of the displaced 
      single-stranded DNA confirmed R-loop formation at the endogenous FMR1 locus and 
      further indicated that R-loops formed over CGG repeats may be prone to structural 
      complexities, including hairpin formation, not commonly associated with other 
      R-loops. These observations introduce a new molecular feature of the FMR1 gene 
      that is directly affected by CGG-repeat expansion and is likely to be involved in 
      the associated cellular dysfunction.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the gene (HTT) encoding the huntingtin protein (HTT). This 
      mutation leads to multiple cellular and synaptic alterations that are mimicked in 
      many current HD animal models. However, the most commonly used, 
      well-characterized HD models do not accurately reproduce the genetics of human 
      disease. Recently, a new 'humanized' mouse model, termed Hu97/18, has been 
      developed that genetically recapitulates human HD, including two human HTT 
      alleles, no mouse Hdh alleles and heterozygosity of the HD mutation. Previously, 
      behavioral and neuropathological testing in Hu97/18 mice revealed many features 
      of HD, yet no electrophysiological measures were employed to investigate possible 
      synaptic alterations. Here, we describe electrophysiological changes in the 
      striatum and hippocampus of the Hu97/18 mice. At 9 months of age, a stage when 
      cognitive deficits are fully developed and motor dysfunction is also evident, 
      Hu97/18 striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) exhibited small changes in 
      membrane properties and lower amplitude and frequency of spontaneous excitatory 
      postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs); however, release probability from presynaptic 
      terminals was unaltered. Strikingly, these mice also exhibited a profound 
      deficiency in long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA3-to-CA1 synapses. In contrast, 
      at 6 months of age we found only subtle alterations in SPN synaptic transmission, 
      while 3-month old animals did not display any electrophysiologically detectable 
      changes in the striatum and CA1 LTP was intact. Together, these data reveal 
      robust, progressive deficits in synaptic function and plasticity in Hu97/18 mice, 
      consistent with previously reported behavioral abnormalities, and suggest an 
      optimal age (9 months) for future electrophysiological assessment in preclinical 
      studies of HD.

PG  - e94475
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0094475 [doi]
LID - e94475
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased rates of autoinflammatory and autoimmune disorders have 
      been observed in female premutation carriers of CGG repeat expansion alleles of 
      between 55-200 repeats in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. To 
      determine whether an abnormal immune profile was present at a cellular level that 
      may predispose female carriers to autoinflammatory conditions, we investigated 
      dynamic cytokine production following stimulation of blood cells. In addition, 
      splenocyte responses were examined in an FMR1 CGG knock-in mouse model of the 
      fragile X premutation. METHODS: Human monocyte and peripheral blood leukocytes 
      (PBLs) were isolated from the blood of 36 female FMR1 premutation carriers and 15 
      age-matched controls. Cells were cultured with media alone, LPS or PHA. In the 
      animal model, splenocytes were isolated from 32 CGG knock-in mice and 32 wild 
      type littermates. Splenocytes were cultured with media alone or LPS or 
      PMA/Ionomycin. Concentrations of cytokines (GM-CSF, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, 
      IL-17, IFNgamma, TNFalpha, and MCP-1) were determined from the supernatants of cellular 
      cultures via Luminex multiplex assay. Additionally, phenotypic cellular markers 
      were assessed on cells isolated from human subjects via flow cytometry. RESULTS: 
      We found decreases in cytokine production in human premutation carriers as well 
      as in the FMR1 knock-in mice when compared with controls. Levels of cytokines 
      were found to be associated with CGG repeat length in both human and mouse. 
      Furthermore, T cells from human premutation carriers showed decreases in cell 
      surface markers of activation when compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      study, FMR1 CGG repeat expansions are associated with decreased immune responses 
      and immune dysregulation in both humans and mice. Deficits in immune responses in 
      female premutation carriers may lead to increased susceptibility to autoimmunity 
      and further research is warranted to determine the link between FMR1 CGG repeat 
      lengths and onset of autoinflammatory conditions.

TI  - Mitochondrial membrane fluidity is consistently increased in different models of 
      Huntington disease: restorative effects of olesoxime.
PG  - 107-18
LID - 10.1007/s12035-014-8663-3 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene (HTT). One prominent target of 
      the mutant huntingtin protein (mhtt) is the mitochondrion, affecting its 
      morphology, distribution, and function. Thus, mitochondria have been suggested as 
      potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of HD. Olesoxime, a 
      cholesterol-like compound, promotes motor neuron survival and neurite outgrowth 
      in vitro, and its effects are presumed to occur via a direct interaction with 
      mitochondrial membranes (MMs). We examined the properties of MMs isolated from 
      cell and animal models of HD as well as the effects of olesoxime on MM fluidity 
      and cholesterol levels. MMs isolated from brains of aged Hdh Q111/Q111 knock-in 
      mice showed a significant decrease in 1,6-diphenyl-hexatriene (DPH) anisotropy, 
      which is inversely correlated with membrane fluidity. Similar increases in MM 
      fluidity were observed in striatal STHdh Q111/Q111 cells as well as in MMs 
      isolated from brains of BACHD transgenic rats. Treatment of STHdh cells with 
      olesoxime decreased the fluidity of isolated MMs. Decreased membrane fluidity was 
      also measured in olesoxime-treated MMs isolated from brains of HD knock-in mice. 
      In both models, treatment with olesoxime restored HD-specific changes in MMs. 
      Accordingly, olesoxime significantly counteracted the mhtt-induced increase in MM 
      fluidity of MMs isolated from brains of BACHD rats after 12 months of treatment 
      in vivo, possibly by enhancing MM cholesterol levels. Thus, olesoxime may 
      represent a novel pharmacological tool to treat mitochondrial dysfunction in HD.

AB  - PURPOSE: To study cerebral adenosine receptors (AR) in premanifest and manifest 
      stages of Huntington's disease (HD). METHODS: We quantified the cerebral binding 
      potential (BP ND) of the A(1)AR in carriers of the HD CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion using the radioligand [(18) F]CPFPX and PET. Four groups were 
      investigated: (i) premanifest individuals far (preHD-A; n = 7) or (ii) near 
      (preHD-B; n = 6) to the predicted symptom onset, (iii) manifest HD patients 
      (n = 8), and (iv) controls (n = 36). RESULTS: Cerebral A(1)AR values of preHD-A 
      subjects were generally higher than those of controls (by up to 31%, p < .01, in 
      the thalamus on average). Across stages a successive reduction of A(1)AR BPND was 
      observed to the levels of controls in preHD-B and undercutting controls in 
      manifest HD by down to 25%, p < .01, in the caudatus and amygdala. There was a 
      strong correlation between A(1)AR BP ND and years to onset. Before onset of HD, the 
      assumed annual rates of change of A(1)AR density were -1.2% in the caudatus, -1.7% 
      in the thalamus and -3.4% in the amygdala, while the corresponding volume losses 
      amounted to 0.6%, 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Adenosine receptors 
      switch from supra to subnormal levels during phenoconversion of HD. This 
      differential regulation may play a role in the pathophysiology of altered energy 
      metabolism.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Both central and peripheral 
      innate immune activation have been described as features of the disease. Isolated 
      human HD monocytes have been shown to produce more cytokines upon LPS stimulation 
      compared to control monocytes. Understanding alterations in the signalling 
      cascades responsible and activated by this increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine 
      production is crucial in understanding the molecular basis of this phenomenon. 
      Here we investigated the signalling cascade most commonly activated by 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 - the JAK/STAT signalling cascade. Using 
      flow cytometry, we show that one out of three key transcription factors activated 
      by JAK/STAT signalling is altered in primary human HD innate immune cells, 
      suggesting that this pathway may only play a minor, additive role in the immune 
      cell dysfunction in HD.

TI  - HTT-lowering reverses Huntington's disease immune dysfunction caused by NFkappaB 
      pathway dysregulation.
PG  - 819-33
LID - 10.1093/brain/awt355 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. The peripheral innate immune system 
      contributes to Huntington's disease pathogenesis and has been targeted 
      successfully to modulate disease progression, but mechanistic understanding 
      relating this to mutant huntingtin expression in immune cells has been lacking. 
      Here we demonstrate that human Huntington's disease myeloid cells produce 
      excessive inflammatory cytokines as a result of the cell-intrinsic effects of 
      mutant huntingtin expression. A direct effect of mutant huntingtin on the NFkappaB 
      pathway, whereby it interacts with IKKgamma, leads to increased degradation of IkappaB 
      and subsequent nuclear translocation of RelA. Transcriptional alterations in 
      intracellular immune signalling pathways are also observed. Using a novel method 
      of small interfering RNA delivery to lower huntingtin expression, we show 
      reversal of disease-associated alterations in cellular function-the first time 
      this has been demonstrated in primary human cells. Glucan-encapsulated small 
      interfering RNA particles were used to lower huntingtin levels in human 
      Huntington's disease monocytes/macrophages, resulting in a reversal of 
      huntingtin-induced elevated cytokine production and transcriptional changes. 
      These findings improve our understanding of the role of innate immunity in 
      neurodegeneration, introduce glucan-encapsulated small interfering RNA particles 
      as tool for studying cellular pathogenesis ex vivo in human cells and raise the 
      prospect of immune cell-directed HTT-lowering as a therapeutic in Huntington's 
      disease.

TI  - Copy-number variation of the neuronal glucose transporter gene SLC2A3 and age of 
      onset in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 3129-37
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddu022 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder which is 
      inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. HD is caused by a trinucleotide CAG 
      repeat expansion that encodes a polyglutamine stretch in the huntingtin (HTT) 
      protein. Mutant HTT expression leads to a myriad of cellular dysfunctions 
      culminating in neuronal loss and consequent motor, cognitive and psychiatric 
      disturbances in HD patients. The length of the CAG repeat is inversely correlated 
      with age of onset (AO) in HD patients, while environmental and genetic factors 
      can further modulate this parameter. Here, we explored whether the recently 
      described copy-number variation (CNV) of the gene SLC2A3-which encodes the 
      neuronal glucose transporter GLUT3-could modulate AO in HD. Strikingly, we found 
      that increased dosage of SLC2A3 delayed AO in an HD cohort of 987 individuals, 
      and that this correlated with increased levels of GLUT3 in HD patient cells. To 
      our knowledge this is the first time that CNV of a candidate gene has been found 
      to modulate HD pathogenesis. Furthermore, we found that increasing dosage of 
      Glut1-the Drosophila melanogaster homologue of this glucose 
      transporter-ameliorated HD-relevant phenotypes in fruit flies, including 
      neurodegeneration and life expectancy. As alterations in glucose metabolism have 
      been implicated in HD pathogenesis, this study may have important therapeutic 
      relevance for HD.

TI  - Fragile X syndrome due to a missense mutation.
PG  - 1185-9
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2013.311 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is a common inherited form of intellectual disability and 
      autism spectrum disorder. Most patients exhibit a massive CGG-repeat expansion 
      mutation in the FMR1 gene that silences the locus. In over two decades since the 
      discovery of FMR1, only a single missense mutation (p.(Ile304Asn)) has been 
      reported as causing fragile X syndrome. Here we describe a 16-year-old male 
      presenting with fragile X syndrome but without the repeat expansion mutation. 
      Rather, we find a missense mutation, c.797G>A, that replaces glycine 266 with 
      glutamic acid (p.(Gly266Glu)). The Gly266Glu FMR protein abolished many 
      functional properties of the protein. This patient highlights the diagnostic 
      utility of FMR1 sequencing.

TI  - Intrajugular vein delivery of AAV9-RNAi prevents neuropathological changes and 
      weight loss in Huntington's disease mice.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurological disorder caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the HTT gene, which encodes a mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT). The 
      mutation confers a toxic gain of function on huntingtin, leading to widespread 
      neurodegeneration and inclusion formation in many brain regions. Although the 
      hallmark symptom of HD is hyperkinesia stemming from striatal degeneration, 
      several other brain regions are affected which cause psychiatric, cognitive, and 
      metabolic symptoms. Additionally, mHTT expression in peripheral tissue is 
      associated with skeletal muscle atrophy, cardiac failure, weight loss, and 
      diabetes. We, and others, have demonstrated a prevention of motor symptoms in HD 
      mice following direct striatal injection of adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) 
      serotype 1 encoding an RNA interference (RNAi) construct targeting mutant HTT 
      mRNA (mHTT). Here, we expand these efforts and demonstrate that an intrajugular 
      vein injection of AAV serotype 9 (AAV9) expressing a mutant HTT-specific RNAi 
      construct significantly reduced mHTT expression in multiple brain regions and 
      peripheral tissues affected in HD. Correspondingly, this approach prevented 
      atrophy and inclusion formation in key brain regions as well as the severe weight 
      loss germane to HD transgenic mice. These results demonstrate that systemic 
      delivery of AAV9-RNAi may provide more widespread clinical benefit for patients 
      suffering from HD.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by a pathological CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the large 
      multi-exon gene, huntingtin (HTT). Although multiple pathogenic mechanisms have 
      been proposed for HD, there is increasing interest in the RNA processing of the 
      HTT gene. In mammals, most multi-exon genes are alternatively spliced; however, 
      few alternative transcripts have been described for HTT. Given the numerous 
      protein bands detected in mouse and human brain tissue by Western blotting using 
      anti-huntingtin antibodies, we examined whether alternative splicing of HTT may 
      account for some of these fragments. Using RT-PCR in mouse brain, we detected two 
      novel splice variants of Htt that lacked the 111-bp exon 29 (Htt...ex29) or 
      retained a 57-bp portion of intron 28 (Htt(+57)in28) via use of a cryptic splice 
      site. The alternative transcripts were present in wild-type and homozygous 
      Hdh(Q150/Q150) mouse brain at all ages and in all brain regions and peripheral 
      tissues studied. Differential splicing of Htt...ex29 was found in the cerebellum of 
      Hdh(Q150/Q150) mice with a significant reduction in transcript levels in mutant 
      animals. In human brain, we detected similar splice variants lacking exons 28 and 
      29. The ability of alternatively spliced transcripts to encode different protein 
      isoforms with individual functions in the cell, combined with the known role of 
      splicing in disease, renders these novel transcripts of interest in the context 
      of HD pathogenesis.

TI  - Preventing formation of toxic N-terminal huntingtin fragments through antisense 
      oligonucleotide-mediated protein modification.
PG  - 4-12
LID - 10.1089/nat.2013.0452 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive autosomal dominant disorder, caused by 
      a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene, which results in expansion of a 
      polyglutamine stretch at the N-terminal end of the huntingtin protein. Several 
      studies have implicated the importance of proteolytic cleavage of mutant 
      huntingtin in HD pathogenesis and it is generally accepted that N-terminal 
      huntingtin fragments are more toxic than full-length protein. Important cleavage 
      sites are encoded by exon 12 of HTT. Here we report proof of concept using 
      antisense oligonucleotides to induce skipping of exon 12 in huntingtin pre-mRNA, 
      thereby preventing the formation of a 586 amino acid N-terminal huntingtin 
      fragment implicated in HD toxicity. In vitro studies showed successful exon 
      skipping and appearance of a shorter huntingtin protein. Cleavage assays showed 
      reduced 586 amino acid N-terminal huntingtin fragments in the treated samples. In 
      vivo studies revealed exon skipping after a single injection of antisense 
      oligonucleotides in the mouse striatum. Recent advances to inhibit the formation 
      of mutant huntingtin using oligonucleotides seem promising therapeutic strategies 
      for HD. Nevertheless, huntingtin is an essential protein and total removal has 
      been shown to result in progressive neurodegeneration in vivo. Our proof of 
      concept shows a completely novel approach to reduce mutant huntingtin toxicity 
      not by reducing its expressing levels, but by modifying the huntingtin protein.

TI  - C9orf72 expansions are the most common genetic cause of Huntington disease 
      phenocopies.
PG  - 292-9
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000000061 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In many cases where Huntington disease (HD) is suspected, the genetic 
      test for HD is negative: these are known as HD phenocopies. A repeat expansion in 
      the C9orf72 gene has recently been identified as a major cause of familial and 
      sporadic frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our 
      objective was to determine whether this mutation causes HD phenocopies. METHODS: 
      A cohort of 514 HD phenocopy patients were analyzed for the C9orf72 expansion 
      using repeat primed PCR. In cases where the expansion was found, Southern 
      hybridization was performed to determine expansion size. Clinical case notes were 
      reviewed to determine the phenotype of expansion-positive cases. RESULTS: Ten 
      subjects (1.95%) had the expansion, making it the most common identified genetic 
      cause of HD phenocopy presentations. The size of expansion was not significantly 
      different from that associated with other clinical presentations of C9orf72 
      expanded cases. The C9orf72 expansion-positive subjects were characterized by the 
      presence of movement disorders, including dystonia, chorea, myoclonus, tremor, 
      and rigidity. Furthermore, the age at onset in this cohort was lower than 
      previously reported for subjects with the C9orf72 expansion and included one case 
      with pediatric onset. DISCUSSION: This study extends the known phenotype of the 
      C9orf72 expansion in both age at onset and movement disorder symptoms. We propose 
      a revised clinico-genetic algorithm for the investigation of HD phenocopy 
      patients based on these data.

AB  - Trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansion underpins a number of inheritable 
      neurological human disorders. Multiple mechanisms are thought to contribute to 
      the expansion process. The incorrect processing of the repeat tract by DNA repair 
      proteins can drive this mutation process forward, as expansions are suppressed 
      following ablation of certain repair factors in mouse models and cell models of 
      disease. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is one repair pathway implicated in TNR 
      instability, although most previous work focussed on TNR contractions, not 
      expansions. Here we investigated the role of NER in modulating expansions of 
      threshold-length (CTG.CAG) repeats in yeast. We show that both the global genome 
      and transcription-coupled repair subpathways promote expansions of 
      threshold-length TNRs. Furthermore, NER works with the 26S proteasome to drive 
      expansions, based on analysis of double mutants defective in both pathways, and 
      of Rad23, a protein involved in both NER and the shuttling of ubiquitinated 
      proteins to the proteasome. This work provides the first evidence that both 
      subpathways of NER can promote threshold-length TNR expansions and that NER 
      interacts with the proteasome to drive expansions.

AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate common polymorphisms in the 
      genes encoding monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and serotonin transporter (5-HTT) in 
      Norwegian cases of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). This was done to further 
      elucidate the role of genetic variation in these genes and SIDS. METHODS: A 
      variable number of tandem repeat area in the promoter of the MAOA gene and 
      rs25531 in the promoter region of the gene encoding 5-HTT were investigated in 
      193 SIDS cases and 335 controls. The methods used were polymerase chain reaction, 
      restriction fragment analysis and gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: There were no 
      differences between SIDS cases and controls for any of the investigated 
      polymorphisms. This was also true when male and female SIDS cases were analysed 
      separately. CONCLUSION: This article indicates that neither the VNTR in the 
      promoter of the MAOA gene, nor rs25531 in the gene encoding 5-HTT, is involved in 
      SIDS. However, as medullary serotonergic abnormalities most likely contribute to 
      the death in at least some SIDS cases, it is important to investigate these 
      genes, as well as other genes involved in the serotonergic network, in more 
      detail.

TI  - Deficits in a Simple Visual Go/No-go Discrimination Task in Two Mouse Models of 
      Huntington's Disease.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD), a devastating neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion on the HTT gene located on chromosome 4, is associated with 
      a characteristic pattern of progressive cognitive dysfunction known to involve 
      early deficits in executive function. A modified Go/No-go successive 
      discrimination task was designed to assess the type of online response 
      control/executive function known to be disrupted in patients with HD. The present 
      studies show that this simple discrimination assay revealed early and robust 
      deficits in two mouse models of HD, the zQ175 KI mouse (deficits from 28 weeks of 
      age) and the R6/2 mouse, carrying ~240 CAG repeats (deficits from 9 weeks of 
      age). These deficits are not due to gross motor dysfunction in the test animals, 
      but instead appear to measure some inability to inhibit responding in the HD 
      mouse models, suggesting this assay may measure deficits in underlying 
      attentional and/or behavioral inhibition processes. Accordingly, this assay may 
      be well suited to evaluation of simple deficits in cognitive function in mouse HD 
      models, providing a potential platform for preclinical screening.

TI  - Biophysical characterization of G-quadruplex forming FMR1 mRNA and of its 
      interactions with different fragile X mental retardation protein isoforms.
PG  - 103-14
LID - 10.1261/rna.041442.113 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental impairment in 
      humans, is caused by the absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein 
      (FMRP) due to a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5'-untranslated region 
      (UTR) and subsequent translational silencing of the fragile x mental 
      retardation-1 (FMR1) gene. FMRP, which is proposed to be involved in the 
      translational regulation of specific neuronal messenger RNA (mRNA) targets, 
      contains an arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) box RNA binding domain that has been 
      shown to bind with high affinity to G-quadruplex forming mRNA structures. FMRP 
      undergoes alternative splicing, and the binding of FMRP to a proposed 
      G-quadruplex structure in the coding region of its mRNA (named FBS) has been 
      proposed to affect the mRNA splicing events at exon 15. In this study, we used 
      biophysical methods to directly demonstrate the folding of FMR1 FBS into a 
      secondary structure that contains two specific G-quadruplexes and analyze its 
      interactions with several FMRP isoforms. Our results show that minor splice 
      isoforms, ISO2 and ISO3, created by the usage of the second and third acceptor 
      sites at exon 15, bind with higher affinity to FBS than FMRP ISO1, which is 
      created by the usage of the first acceptor site. FMRP ISO2 and ISO3 cannot 
      undergo phosphorylation, an FMRP post-translational modification shown to 
      modulate the protein translation regulation. Thus, their expression has to be 
      tightly regulated, and this might be accomplished by a feedback mechanism 
      involving the FMRP interactions with the G-quadruplex structures formed within 
      FMR1 mRNA.

      therapy in psychiatric inpatients.

LID - 10.1089/gtmb.2013.0217 [doi]
AB  - Serotonergic pathways are known to play an essential role in the effects 
      generated by antidepressants. Polymorphisms in serotonin receptor and transporter 
      genes have been identified as an important factor. To investigate which of these 
      polymorphisms may be useful to predict clinical outcome, we assessed their effect 
      in a naturalistic clinical study. We studied the influence of the 
      5-hydroxytryptamine transporter (5-HTT) variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), 
      5-HTTLPR/rs25531 and a 5-HTR2A intron 2 SNP with regard to response and side 
      effects in 273 psychiatric inpatients. Main clinical assessments included 
      Clinical Global Impressions ratings, paranoid depression scale self-rating scale 
      and Dosage Record, and Treatment Emergent Symptoms (DOTES) Scale. We found 
      significant associations between 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 S/L(G) alleles and response and 
      side effects in 100 patients with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) 
      treatment (p = 0.037, CGI-I </= 2: 0% vs. 19% and p = 0.0005, DOTES cluster c: 0.76 
      vs. 0.19). 5-HTT VNTR and 5-HTR2A intron 2 polymorphisms were associated 
      significantly with adverse effects in patients with selective and nonselective 
      SRI (5-HTT VNTR 12/12: n = 170, p = 0.0001, side effect rates: 51% vs. 19% and 
      rs7997012 [A/A]: n = 50, p = 0.020, side effects rates: 43% vs. 11%). No impact 
      of the polymorphisms on mirtazapine treatment was found. Our study confirms the 
      influence of serotonergic polymorphisms at the receptor and transporter level on 
      SSRI response and side effects, supporting previous reports based on various 
      study designs. The effects were strong enough to be noticed clinically in this 
      naturalistic setting. However, randomized controlled trials are warranted to 
      provide unequivocal evidence of the clinical usefulness of pretherapeutic 
      screening for these polymorphisms.

LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32171 [doi]
AB  - This study sought to examine the association between the cumulative risk severity 
      conferred by the total number of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
      risk alleles of the DAT1 3'UTR variable number tandem repeat (VNTR), DRD4 Exon 3 
      VNTR, and 5-HTTLPR with ADHD characteristics, clinical correlates, and functional 
      outcomes in a pediatric sample. Participants were derived from case-control 
      family studies of boys and girls diagnosed with ADHD, a genetic linkage study of 
      families with children with ADHD, and a family genetic study of pediatric bipolar 
      disorder. Caucasian children 18 and younger with and without ADHD and with 
      available genetic data were included in this analysis (N = 591). The association 
      of genetic risk severity with sociodemographic, clinical characteristics, 
      neuropsychological, emotional, and behavioral correlates was examined in the 
      entire sample, in the sample with ADHD, and in the sample without ADHD, 
      respectively. Greater genetic risk severity was significantly associated with the 
      presence of disruptive behavior disorders in the entire sample and oppositional 
      defiant disorder in participants with ADHD. Greater genetic risk severity was 
      also associated with the absence of anxiety disorders, specifically with the 
      absence of agoraphobia in the context of ADHD. Additionally, one ADHD symptom was 
      significantly associated with greater genetic risk severity. Genetic risk 
      severity is significantly associated with ADHD clinical characteristics and 
      co-morbid disorders, and the nature of these associations may vary on the type 
      (externalizing vs. internalizing) of the disorder.

AB  - More than 20 human genetic diseases are associated with inheriting an unstable 
      expanded DNA simple sequence tandem repeat, for example, CTG 
      (cytosine-thymine-guanine) repeats in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and CAG 
      (cytosine-adenine-guanine) repeats in Huntington disease (HD). These sequences 
      mutate by changing the number of repeats not just between generations, but also 
      during the lifetime of affected individuals. Levels of somatic instability 
      contribute to disease onset and progression but as changes are tissue-specific, 
      age- and repeat length-dependent, interpretation of the level of somatic 
      instability in an individual is confounded by these considerations. Mathematical 
      models, fitted to CTG repeat length distributions derived from blood DNA, from a 
      large cohort of DM1-affected or at risk individuals, have recently been used to 
      quantify inherited repeat lengths and mutation rates. Taking into account age, 
      the estimated mutation rates are lower than predicted among individuals with 
      small alleles (inherited repeat lengths less than 100 CTGs), suggesting that 
      these rates may be suppressed at the lower end of the disease-causing range. In 
      this study, we propose that a length-specific effect operates within this range 
      and tested this hypothesis using a model comparison approach. To calibrate the 
      extended model, we used data derived from blood DNA from DM1 individuals and, for 
      the first time, buccal DNA from HD individuals. In a novel application of this 
      extended model, we identified individuals whose effective repeat length, with 
      regards to somatic instability, is less than their actual repeat length. A 
      plausible explanation for this distinction is that the expanded repeat tract is 
      compromised by interruptions or other unusual features. We quantified effective 
      length for a large cohort of DM1 individuals and showed that effective length 
      better predicts age of onset than inherited repeat length, thus improving the 
      genotype-phenotype correlation. Under the extended model, we removed some of the 
      bias in mutation rates making them less length-dependent. Consequently, rates 
      adjusted in this way will be better suited as quantitative traits to investigate 
      cis- or trans-acting modifiers of somatic mosaicism, disease onset and 
      progression.

PG  - 458-63
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2013.185 [doi]
AB  - Copy number variants visible with the light microscope have been described as 
      euchromatic variants (EVs) and EVs with extra G-light material at 8q21.2 have 
      been reported only once before. We report four further patients with EVs of 
      8q21.2 ascertained for clinical (3) or reproductive reasons (1). Enhanced signal 
      strength from two overlapping bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and 
      microarray analysis mapped the EV to a 284-kb interval in the reference genome. 
      This interval consists of a sequence gap flanked by segmental duplications that 
      contain the 12-kb components of one of the largest Variable Number Tandem Repeat 
      arrays in the human genome. Using digital NanoString technology with a custom 
      probe for the RNA exonuclease 1 homologue (S. cerevisiae)-like 1 (REXO1L1) gene 
      within each 12-kb repeat, significantly enhanced diploid copy numbers of 270 and 
      265 were found in an EV family and a median diploid copy number of 166 copies in 
      216 controls. These 8q21.2 EVs are not thought to have clinical consequences as 
      the phenotypes of the probands were inconsistent, those referred for reproductive 
      reasons were otherwise phenotypically normal and the REXO1L1 gene has no known 
      disease association. This EV was found in 4/3078 (1 in 770) consecutive referrals 
      for chromosome analysis and needs to be distinguished from pathogenic imbalances 
      of medial 8q. The REXO1L1 gene product is a marker of hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
      infection and a possible association between REXO1L1 copy number and 
      susceptibility to HCV infection, progression or response to treatment has not yet 
      been excluded.

TI  - Modeling Huntington disease in Drosophila: Insights into axonal transport defects 
      and modifiers of toxicity.
PG  - 229-36

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the huntingtin (Htt) gene. Despite years of 
      research, there is no treatment that extends life for patients with the disorder. 
      Similarly, little is known about which cellular pathways that are altered by 
      pathogenic Huntingtin (Htt) protein expression are correlated with neuronal loss. 
      As part of a longstanding effort to gain insights into HD pathology, we have been 
      studying the protein in the context of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. We 
      generated transgenic HD models in Drosophila by engineering flies that carry a 
      12-exon fragment of the human Htt gene with or without the toxic trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion. We also created variants with a monomeric red fluorescent 
      protein (mRFP) tag fused to Htt that allows in vivo imaging of Htt protein 
      localization and aggregation. While wild-type Htt remains diffuse throughout the 
      cytoplasm of cells, pathogenic Htt forms insoluble aggregates that accumulate in 
      neuronal soma and axons. Aggregates can physically block transport of numerous 
      organelles along the axon. We have also observed that aggregates are formed 
      quickly, within just a few hours of mutant Htt expression. To explore mechanisms 
      of neurodegeneration in our HD model, we performed in vivo and in vitro screens 
      to search for modifiers of viability and pathogenic Htt aggregation. Our results 
      identified several novel candidates for HD therapeutics that can now be tested in 
      mammalian models of HD. Furthermore, these experiments have highlighted the 
      complex relationship between aggregates and toxicity that exists in HD.

AB  - Huntington's disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion encoding a polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin (Htt) protein. Here we 
      report a genome-wide overexpression suppressor screen in which we identified 317 
      ORFs that ameliorate the toxicity of a mutant Htt fragment in yeast and that have 
      roles in diverse cellular processes, including mitochondrial import and copper 
      metabolism. Two of these suppressors encode glutathione peroxidases (GPxs), which 
      are conserved antioxidant enzymes that catalyze the reduction of hydrogen 
      peroxide and lipid hydroperoxides. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches 
      in yeast, mammalian cells and Drosophila, we found that GPx activity robustly 
      ameliorates Huntington's disease-relevant metrics and is more protective than 
      other antioxidant approaches tested here. Notably, we found that GPx activity, 
      unlike many antioxidant treatments, does not inhibit autophagy, which is an 
      important mechanism for clearing mutant Htt. Because previous clinical trials 
      have indicated that GPx mimetics are well tolerated in humans, this study may 
      have important implications for treating Huntington's disease.

PG  - 9634-50
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkt725 [doi]
AB  - Autosomal dominant diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD) are caused by a 
      gain of function mutant protein and/or RNA. An ideal treatment for these diseases 
      is to selectively suppress expression of the mutant allele while preserving 
      expression of the wild-type variant. RNase H active antisense oligonucleotides 
      (ASOs) or small interfering RNAs can achieve allele selective suppression of gene 
      expression by targeting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 
      the repeat expansion. ASOs have been previously shown to discriminate single 
      nucleotide changes in targeted RNAs with  approximately 5-fold selectivity. Based on RNase H 
      enzymology, we enhanced single nucleotide discrimination by positional 
      incorporation of chemical modifications within the oligonucleotide to limit RNase 
      H cleavage of the non-targeted transcript. The resulting oligonucleotides 
      demonstrate >100-fold discrimination for a single nucleotide change at an SNP 
      site in the disease causing huntingtin mRNA, in patient cells and in a completely 
      humanized mouse model of HD. The modified ASOs were also well tolerated after 
      injection into the central nervous system of wild-type animals, suggesting that 
      their tolerability profile is suitable for advancement as potential 
      allele-selective HD therapeutics. Our findings lay the foundation for efficient 
      allele-selective downregulation of gene expression using ASOs-an outcome with 
      broad application to HD and other dominant genetic disorders.

      haplotype.

LID - 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182a4a4af [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD, OMIM #143100) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder due to a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene, encoding a polyglutamine 
      tract in the N-terminal part of the huntingtin protein. Most cases are inherited 
      from an affected parent, but in about 10% of cases the condition appears to be de 
      novo.(1) De novo or sporadic cases are usually due to CAG repeat expansion of 
      intermediate alleles. Intermediate alleles have 27-35 CAG repeats, and the higher 
      the number of repeats, the higher the risk for expansion into disease range, 
      usually upon paternal transmission.(2) In most cases, the change in repeat size 
      is minor, and gradual increases into the disease range over several generations 
      is the basis of new genetic mutations and stable disease prevalence. So far, the 
      largest single-step expansions reported were from 27 to 38(3) and from 35 to 
      58(2) CAG repeats. It has recently been shown that intermediate alleles and 
      disease alleles share the same haplotypes, which is expected if intermediate 
      alleles are the main source of new mutation cases. The high-risk haplotypes are 
      called A1 and A2, and are both prevalent among Caucasians but rare in other 
      ethnic groups.(4)

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG)-repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. 
      Early changes that may precede clinical manifestation of movement disorder 
      include executive dysfunction. The aim of this study was to identify functional 
      network correlates of impaired higher cognitive functioning in relation to HD 
      stage. Blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional-magnetic resonance 
      imaging (fMRI) and structural-MRI were performed in 53 subjects with the 
      HD-mutation (41 prodromals, 12 early affected) and 52 controls. Disease stage was 
      estimated for each subject with HD-mutation based on age, length of the 
      CAG-repeat expansion mutation and also putaminal atrophy. The Tower of London 
      test was administered with three levels of complexity during fMRI as a challenge 
      of executive function. Functional brain networks of interest were identified 
      based on cortical gray matter voxel-clusters with significantly enhanced 
      task-related functional coupling to the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) area. 
      While prodromal HD-subjects showed similar performance levels as controls, 
      multivariate analysis of task-related functional coupling to the MPFC identified 
      reduced connectivity in prodromal and early manifest HD-subjects for a cluster 
      including mainly parts of the left premotor area. Secondary testing indicated a 
      significant moderator effect for task complexity on group differences and on the 
      degree of correlation to measures of HD stage. Our data suggest that impaired 
      premotor-MPFC coupling reflects HD stage related dysfunction of cognitive systems 
      involved in executive function and may be present in prodromal HD-subjects that 
      are still cognitively normal. Additional longitudinal studies may reveal temporal 
      relationships between impaired task-related premotor-MPFC coupling and other 
      brain changes in HD.

TI  - CAG size-specific risk estimates for intermediate allele repeat instability in 
      Huntington disease.
PG  - 696-703
LID - 10.1136/jmedgenet-2013-101796 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: New mutations for Huntington disease (HD) occur due to CAG repeat 
      instability of intermediate alleles (IA). IAs have between 27 and 35 CAG repeats, 
      a range just below the disease threshold of 36 repeats. While they usually do not 
      confer the HD phenotype, IAs are prone to paternal germline CAG repeat 
      instability. Consequently, they may expand into the HD range upon transmission to 
      the next generation, producing a new mutation. Quantified risk estimates for IA 
      repeat instability are extremely limited but needed to inform clinical practice. 
      METHODS: Using small-pool PCR of sperm DNA from Caucasian men, we examined the 
      frequency and magnitude of CAG repeat instability across the entire range of 
      intermediate CAG sizes. The CAG size-specific risk estimates generated are based 
      on the largest sample size ever examined, including 30 IAs and 18 198 sperm. 
      RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate a significant risk of new mutations. While all 
      intermediate CAG sizes demonstrated repeat expansion into the HD range, alleles 
      with 34 and 35 CAG repeats were associated with the highest risk of a new 
      mutation (2.4% and 21.0%, respectively). IAs with >/=33 CAG repeats showed a 
      dramatic increase in the frequency of instability and a switch towards a 
      preponderance of repeat expansions over contractions. CONCLUSIONS: These data 
      provide novel insights into the origins of new mutations for HD. The CAG 
      size-specific risk estimates inform clinical practice and provide accurate risk 
      information for persons who receive an IA predictive test result.

TI  - The V471A polymorphism in autophagy-related gene ATG7 modifies age at onset 
      specifically in Italian Huntington disease patients.
PG  - e68951
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0068951 [doi]

AB  - The cause of Huntington disease (HD) is a polyglutamine repeat expansion of more 
      than 36 units in the huntingtin protein, which is inversely correlated with the 
      age at onset of the disease. However, additional genetic factors are believed to 
      modify the course and the age at onset of HD. Recently, we identified the V471A 
      polymorphism in the autophagy-related gene ATG7, a key component of the autophagy 
      pathway that plays an important role in HD pathogenesis, to be associated with 
      the age at onset in a large group of European Huntington disease patients. To 
      confirm this association in a second independent patient cohort, we analysed the 
      ATG7 V471A polymorphism in additional 1,464 European HD patients of the 
      "REGISTRY" cohort from the European Huntington Disease Network (EHDN). In the 
      entire REGISTRY cohort we could not confirm a modifying effect of the ATG7 V471A 
      polymorphism. However, analysing a modifying effect of ATG7 in these REGISTRY 
      patients and in patients of our previous HD cohort according to their ethnic 
      origin, we identified a significant effect of the ATG7 V471A polymorphism on the 
      HD age at onset only in the Italian population (327 patients). In these Italian 
      patients, the polymorphism is associated with a 6-years earlier disease onset and 
      thus seems to have an aggravating effect. We could specify the role of ATG7 as a 
      genetic modifier for HD particularly in the Italian population. This result 
      affirms the modifying influence of the autophagic pathway on the course of HD, 
      but also suggests population-specific modifying mechanisms in HD pathogenesis.

TI  - A Tale of Two Maladies? Pathogenesis of Depression with and without the 
      Huntington's Disease Gene Mutation.
PG  - 81
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2013.00081 [doi]
LID - 81
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a tandem 
      repeat expansion encoding an expanded tract of glutamines in the huntingtin 
      protein. HD is progressive and manifests as psychiatric symptoms (including 
      depression), cognitive deficits (culminating in dementia), and motor 
      abnormalities (including chorea). Having reached the twentieth anniversary of the 
      discovery of the "genetic stutter" which causes HD, we still lack sophisticated 
      insight into why so many HD patients exhibit affective disorders such as 
      depression at very early stages, prior to overt appearance of motor deficits. In 
      this review, we will focus on depression as the major psychiatric manifestation 
      of HD, discuss potential mechanisms of pathogenesis identified from animal 
      models, and compare depression in HD patients with that of the wider 
      gene-negative population. The discovery of depressive-like behaviors as well as 
      cellular and molecular correlates of depression in transgenic HD mice has added 
      strong support to the hypothesis that the HD mutation adds significantly to the 
      genetic load for depression. A key question is whether HD-associated depression 
      differs from that in the general population. Whilst preclinical studies, clinical 
      data, and treatment responses suggest striking similarities, there are also some 
      apparent differences. We discuss various molecular and cellular mechanisms which 
      may contribute to depression in HD, and whether they may generalize to other 
      depressive disorders. The autosomal dominant nature of HD and the existence of 
      models with excellent construct validity provide a unique opportunity to 
      understand the pathogenesis of depression and associated gene-environment 
      interactions. Thus, understanding the pathogenesis of depression in HD may not

TI  - Association of serotonin transporter polymorphisms with responsiveness to 
      adrenocorticotropic hormone in infantile spasm.
PG  - 251-5
LID - 10.1007/s12519-013-0420-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is an important 
      neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) 
      is a key regulator of the level of serotonergic neurotransmission. In the present 
      study, the contribution of 5-HTT polymorphisms to the risk of infantile spasm 
      (IS) and the responsiveness to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were 
      investigated. METHODS: Two functional polymorphisms, the 44-bp insertion-deletion 
      polymorphism in the promoter region (5-HTTLPR) and the variable number tandem 
      repeat in the second intron (5-HTTVNTR), were genotyped in a Chinese case-control 
      study involving 112 patients with IS and 120 controls. RESULTS: Genotyping 
      yielded valid data in 111 patients and 118 controls for 5-HTTLPR and 110 patients 
      and 118 controls for 5-HTTVNTR. The polymorphisms were not found to have an 
      allelic or genotypic association with IS. However, responsiveness to ACTH was 
      higher in patients who were homozygous for L (91%) than in those with S/L (56%) 
      or S/S (60%) (P=0.017). Haplotype analysis did not improve the observed 
      association. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the 5-HTTLPR genotype may 
      influence the responsiveness to ACTH. This interpretation deserves further study.

TI  - Allele-specific expression of the serotonin transporter and its transcription 
      factors following lamotrigine treatment in vitro.
PG  - 474-83
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32178 [doi]
AB  - Lamotrigine, a mood stabilizer used clinically in the treatment of bipolar 
      disorder, is thought to exert actions on the serotonin system. However 
      lamotrigine's exact mechanism of action remains unclear. The current study 
      investigated whether lamotrigine might exert its effects through altering the 
      expression of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene and its regulatory 
      transcription factors Y box binding protein 1 (YB-1) and CCCTC-binding factor 
      (CTCF). We further considered whether functional variable number tandem repeat 
      (VNTR) polymorphisms in the promoter region of 5-HTT, (5-HTTLPR) and within 
      intron 2 (Stin2) of the gene, moderated any putative gene expression changes. The 
      study employed an in vitro design carried out in human lymphoblastoid cell lines 
      (LCLs) to investigate the effects of lamotrigine treatment at 0.04, 0.2, and 
      0.4 mM doses for 24 hr on the mRNA expression of 5-HTT, YB-1, and CTCF. LCLs were 
      selected based on combinations of haplotypes of the two VNTRs in the serotonin 
      transporter gene; creating low-expressing and high-expressing LCL groups. 
      Ubiquitin C (UBC) and topoisomerase I (TOP1) genes were found to be the most 
      stably expressed housekeeping genes in drug-treated LCLs. Subsequently, 
      quantitative PCR revealed that higher doses of lamotrigine significantly lowered 
      5-HTT expression and increased CTCF expression. Haplotype-specific differences in 
      CTCF expression were found in response to lamotrigine, with strongest expression 
      changes observed in the high-expressing LCLs. These data provide an 
      allele-specific in vitro model for examining the molecular targets of 
      lamotrigine, and support the important role of the serotonin transporter gene in 
      its clinical mechanism of action.

AB  - Reading disability (RD) and language impairment (LI) are common learning 
      disabilities that make acquisition and utilization of reading and verbal language 
      skills, respectively, difficult for affected individuals. Both disorders have a 
      substantial genetic component with complex inheritance. Despite decades of study, 
      reading and language, like many other complex traits, consistently evade 
      identification of causative and functional variants. We previously identified a 
      putative functional risk variant, named BV677278 for its GenBank accession 
      number, for RD in DCDC2. This variant consists of an intronic microdeletion and a 
      highly polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) within its breakpoints. We have also 
      shown this STR to bind to an unknown nuclear protein with high specificity. Here, 
      we replicate BV677278's association with RD, expand its association to LI, 
      identify the BV677278-binding protein as the transcription factor ETV6, and 
      provide compelling genetic evidence that BV677278 is a regulatory element that 
      influences reading and language skills. We also provide evidence that BV677278 
      interacts nonadditively with KIAA0319, an RD-associated gene, to adversely affect 
      several reading and cognitive phenotypes. On the basis of these data, we propose 
      a new name for BV677278: "READ1" or "regulatory element associated with dyslexia 
      1."

TI  - Variants of SLC6A4 in depression risk following severe TBI.
PG  - 696-706
LID - 10.3109/02699052.2013.775481 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic depression (PTD) may be a result of several factors 
      like secondary injury chemical cascades as well as psycho-social factors 
      following traumatic brain injury (TBI). While the role of serotonin in the 
      pathology and treatment of idiopathic major depression may be somewhat 
      controversial, it is unclear what role serotonin may play in PTD following a TBI. 
      OBJECTIVE: To assess serotonergic function and genetic risk for PTD development 
      over 1 year following TBI. RESEARCH DESIGN: Examination of variation in the 
      serotonin transporter gene [SLC6A4 (5-HTTLPR, rs25331, and a variable number of 
      tandem repeats variant in Intron 2)] in 109 subjects with moderate-severe injury. 
      Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at 6 
      and/or 12 months post-injury. MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: At 6 months post-injury, 
      subjects with a history of pre-morbid mood disorders and 5-HTTLPR L-homozygotes 
      were at greater risk for PTD. Contrary to major depression, subjects without 
      pre-morbid mood disorders (n = 80) and S-carriers were 2.803-times less likely to 
      be depressed compared to L-homozygotes. At 12 months post-injury, LG-carriers 
      were also less likely to experience PTD. Temporal analysis also showed 5-HTTLPR 
      associations in PTD development across recovery. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests 
      a unique injury- and temporally-specific interaction between TBI and genetic risk 
      for depression.

TI  - Candidate glutamatergic and dopaminergic pathway gene variants do not influence 
      Huntington's disease motor onset.
PG  - 173-9
LID - 10.1007/s10048-013-0364-y [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor, 
      cognitive, and behavioral disturbances. It is caused by the expansion of the HTT 
      CAG repeat, which is the major determinant of age at onset (AO) of motor 
      symptoms. Aberrant function of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and/or overexposure 
      to dopamine has been suggested to cause significant neurotoxicity, contributing 
      to HD pathogenesis. We used genetic association analysis in 1,628 HD patients to 
      evaluate candidate polymorphisms in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subtype genes 
      (GRIN2A rs4998386 and rs2650427, and GRIN2B rs1806201) and functional 
      polymorphisms in genes in the dopamine pathway (DAT1 3' UTR 40-bp variable number 
      tandem repeat (VNTR), DRD4 exon 3 48-bp VNTR, DRD2 rs1800497, and COMT rs4608) as 
      potential modifiers of the disease process. None of the seven polymorphisms 
      tested was found to be associated with significant modification of motor AO, 
      either in a dominant or additive model, after adjusting for ancestry. The results 
      of this candidate-genetic study therefore do not provide strong evidence to 
      support a modulatory role for these variations within glutamatergic and 
      dopaminergic genes in the AO of HD motor manifestations.

TI  - Characterization of the Huntington intermediate CAG repeat expansion phenotype in 
      PHAROS.

LID - 10.1212/WNL.0b013e318294b304 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe the clinical phenotype conferred by the 
      intermediate-length huntingtin allele CAG repeat expansion in a population-based 
      study. METHODS: The Prospective Huntington At Risk Observational Study (PHAROS) 
      enrolled adults at risk for Huntington disease (HD). They were assessed 
      approximately every 9 months with the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale 
      (UHDRS) by investigators unaware of participants' gene status. UHDRS scores were 
      compared according to the Huntingtin gene CAG repeat number: expanded >36, 
      intermediate 27-35, and nonexpanded controls <26. RESULTS: Fifty (5.1%) of the 
      983 participants had an intermediate allele (IA). They were similar to controls 
      on UHDRS motor, cognitive, and functional measures, but significantly worse 
      behaviorally on apathy and suicidal ideation. On 5 of the 9 other behavioral 
      items and on total behavior, the IA group's scores were worse than those of 
      controls and expanded participants, who themselves scored significantly worse 
      than controls on 6 behavioral measures. Retention rates at 4 years were 48% for 
      the IA group compared to 58% and 60% for the expanded and control groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort at risk for HD, the IA was associated with significant 
      behavioral abnormalities but normal motor and cognition. This behavioral 
      phenotype may represent a prodromal stage of HD, with the potential for 
      subsequent clinical manifestations, or be part of a distinct phenotype conferred 
      by pathology independent of the CAG expansion length.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. Recently, induced 
      pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines carrying atypical and aggressive (CAG60+) HD 
      variants have been generated and exhibit disparate molecular pathologies. Here we 
      investigate two human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines carrying CAG37 and CAG51 
      typical late-onset repeat expansions in comparison to wildtype control lines 
      during undifferentiated states and throughout forebrain neuronal differentiation. 
      Pluripotent HD lines demonstrate growth, viability, pluripotent gene expression, 
      mitochondrial activity and forebrain specification that is indistinguishable from 
      control lines. Expression profiles of crucial genes known to be dysregulated in 
      HD remain unperturbed in the presence of mutant protein and throughout 
      differentiation; however, elevated glutamate-evoked responses were observed in HD 
      CAG51 neurons. These findings suggest typical late-onset HD mutations do not 
      alter pluripotent parameters or the capacity to generate forebrain neurons, but 
      that such progeny may recapitulate hallmarks observed in established HD model 
      systems. Such HD models will help further our understanding of the cascade of 
      pathological events leading to disease onset and progression, while 
      simultaneously facilitating the identification of candidate HD therapeutics.

AB  - 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24OHC) is involved in the conversion of excess 
      cholesterol in the brain, and its level in plasma is related to the number of 
      metabolically active neuronal cells. Previous research suggests that plasma 24OHC 
      is substantially reduced in the presence of neurodegenerative disease. Huntington 
      disease (HD) is an inherited autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused 
      by a cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) triplet repeat expansion in the coding region 
      of the huntingtin (HTT) gene. The current study focused on the relative 
      importance of 24OHC as a marker of HD progression. Using mass spectrometry 
      methods, we examined plasma 24OHC levels in three groups of gene-expanded 
      individuals (Low, Medium, High) characterized by their progression at entry into 
      the parent PREDICT-HD study, along with a group of non-gene-expanded controls 
      (total N=150). In addition, the correlation of 24OHC with a number of motor, 
      cognitive, and imagining markers was examined, and effect sizes for group 
      differences among the markers were computed for comparison with 24OHC. Results 
      show a progression gradient as 24OHC levels decreased as the progression group 
      increased (Low to High). The effect size of group differences for 24OHC was 
      larger than all the other variables, except striatal volume. 24OHC was 
      significantly correlated with many of the other key variables. The results are 
      interpreted in terms of cholesterol synthesis and neuronal degeneration. This 
      study provides evidence that 24OHC is a relatively important marker of HD 
      progression.

TI  - Enhanced asynchronous Ca(2+) oscillations associated with impaired glutamate 
      transport in cortical astrocytes expressing Fmr1 gene premutation expansion.
PG  - 13831-41
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M112.441055 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: FMR1 CGG expansion repeats in the premutation range have not been 
      linked to astrocyte pathophysiology. RESULTS: Premutation cortical astrocytes 
      display decreased Glu transporter expression/activity and enhanced asynchronous 
      Ca(2+) oscillations. CONCLUSION: Glu transport and Ca(2+) signaling defects in 
      premutation astrocytes could contribute to FXTAS neuropathology. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Premutation astrocytes may have an etiological role in FXTAS neuropathology. 
      Premutation CGG repeat expansions (55-200 CGG repeats; preCGG) within the fragile 
      X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene can cause fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome. Defects in early neuronal migration and morphology, 
      electrophysiological activity, and mitochondria trafficking have been described 
      in a premutation mouse model, but whether preCGG mutations also affect astrocyte 
      function remains unknown. PreCGG cortical astrocytes ( approximately 170 CGG repeats) displayed 
      3-fold higher Fmr1 mRNA and 30% lower FMR1 protein (FMRP) when compared with WT. 
      PreCGG astrocytes showed modest reductions in expression of glutamate (Glu) 
      transporters GLT-1 and GLAST and attenuated Glu uptake (p < 0.01). Consistent 
      with astrocyte cultures in vitro, aged preCGG mice cerebral cortex also displayed 
      reduced GLAST and GLT-1 expression. Approximately 65% of the WT and preCGG 
      cortical astrocytes displayed spontaneous asynchronous Ca(2+) oscillations. 
      PreCGG astrocytes exhibited nearly 50% higher frequency of asynchronous Ca(2+) 
      oscillations (p < 0.01) than WT, a difference mimicked by chronic exposure of WT 
      astrocytes to l-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (l-trans-PDC) or by 
      partial suppression of GLAST using siRNA interference. Acute challenge with Glu 
      augmented the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillations in both genotypes. Additionally, 
      10 mum Glu elicited a sustained intracellular Ca(2+) rise in a higher portion of 
      preCGG astrocytes when compared with WT. Pharmacological studies showed that 
      mGluR5, but not NMDA receptor, contributed to Glu hypersensitivity in preCGG 
      astrocytes. These functional defects in preCGG astrocytes, especially in Glu 
      signaling, may contribute to fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      neuropathology.

TI  - Distinct roles for Toll and autophagy pathways in double-stranded RNA toxicity in 
      a Drosophila model of expanded repeat neurodegenerative diseases.
PG  - 2811-9
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddt130 [doi]
AB  - Dominantly inherited expanded repeat neurodegenerative diseases are caused by the 
      expansion of variable copy number tandem repeat sequences in otherwise unrelated 
      genes. Some repeats encode polyglutamine that is thought to be toxic; however, 
      other repeats do not encode polyglutamine indicating either multiple pathogenic 
      pathways or an alternative common toxic agent. As these diseases share numerous 
      clinical features and expanded repeat RNA is a common intermediary, RNA-based 
      pathogenesis has been proposed, based on its toxicity in animal models. In 
      Drosophila, double-stranded (rCAG.rCUG approximately 100) RNA toxicity is Dicer dependent and 
      generates single-stranded (rCAG)7, an entity also detected in affected 
      Huntington's Disease (HD) brains. We demonstrate that Drosophila rCAG.rCUG approximately 100 
      RNA toxicity perturbs several pathways including innate immunity, consistent with 
      the observation in HD that immune activation precedes neuronal toxicity. Our 
      results show that Drosophila rCAG.rCUG approximately 100 RNA toxicity is dependent upon Toll 
      signaling and sensitive to autophagy, further implicating innate immune 
      activation. In exhibiting molecular and cellular hallmarks of HD, double-stranded 
      RNA-mediated activation of innate immunity is, therefore, a candidate pathway for 
      this group of human genetic diseases.

TI  - Polymorphisms of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A/2C receptor genes and 
      5-hydroxytryptamine transporter gene in Chinese patients with OSAHS.
PG  - 1241-8
LID - 10.1007/s11325-013-0829-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is known that there is a genetic predisposition to OSAHS. 
      Polymorphisms of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 2A/2C receptors (5-HTR 2A/2C) 
      genes and 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) gene may be associated with the pathogenesis 
      of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). OBJECTIVES: In this study, 
      we aimed to investigate the prevalence of polymorphisms of the 5-HTR 2A/2C genes 
      and the 5-HTT gene in the Chinese Han OSAHS population. METHODS: A total of 226 
      unrelated subjects of the Chinese Han population, including 121 OSAHS patients 
      and 105 healthy controls, were involved in the study. The A1438G and T102C 
      polymorphisms of the 5-HTR 2A gene, G796C polymorphisms of the 5-HTR 2C gene, and 
      two polymorphisms (gene-linked polymorphic region [LPR] and variable number 
      tandem repeat [VNTR]) of the 5-HTT gene were identified by polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR)-RFLP. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the OSAHS group 
      had significantly higher AA genotype and A allele frequencies in the A1438G 
      polymorphisms of the 5-HTR 2A gene, and had significantly higher frequencies of 
      10/10, 12/10 genotypes and the allele 10 of 5-HTT-VNTR. There were no significant 
      differences between the genotype distribution and allele frequencies of the OSAHS 
      group and the control group regarding the T102C polymorphisms of the 5-HTR 2A 
      gene and the G796C polymorphisms of the 5-HTR 2C gene, the frequencies of the S 
      or L allele and the S/S, S/L or L/L genotypes in 5-HTT-LPR. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      A1438G polymorphism of the 5-HTR 2A gene might be involved in the pathogenesis in 
      OSAHS subjects of the Chinese Han population. Meanwhile, our findings support the 
      argument that 5-HTT polymorphism appears to be associated with susceptibility to 
      OSAHS, because the allele 10 of 5-HTT-VNTR might be a susceptible factor.

TI  - Biomarkers for Huntington's disease: an update.
PG  - 371-5
LID - 10.1517/17530059.2012.701205 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative 
      condition caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene encoding huntingtin which 
      is characterised by progressive motor impairment, cognitive decline and 
      neuropsychiatric disturbances. There are currently no disease-modifying 
      treatments available to patients, but a number of therapeutic strategies are 
      currently being investigated, chief among them are nucleotide-based 'gene 
      silencing' approaches, modulation of huntingtin post-translation modification and 
      enhancing clearance of the mutant protein. In 2008, the authors' review 
      highlighted the need to develop and validate biomarkers and provided a systematic 
      head-to-head comparison of such measures. They searched the PubMed database for 
      publications, which covered each of the subheadings mentioned below. They 
      identified from these list studies which had relevance to biomarker development, 
      as defined in their previous review. Building on a tradition of collaborative 
      research in HD, great advances have been made in the field since that time and a 
      range of outcome measures are now being recommended in order to assess efficacy 
      in future therapeutic trials.

TI  - Translation of HTT mRNA with expanded CAG repeats is regulated by the MID1-PP2A 
      protein complex.
PG  - 1511
LID - 10.1038/ncomms2514 [doi]
AB  - Expansion of CAG repeats is a common feature of various neurodegenerative 
      disorders, including Huntington's disease. Here we show that expanded CAG repeats 
      bind to a translation regulatory protein complex containing MID1, protein 
      phosphatase 2A and 40S ribosomal S6 kinase. Binding of the MID1-protein 
      phosphatase 2A protein complex increases with CAG repeat size and stimulates 
      translation of the CAG repeat expansion containing messenger RNA in a MID1-, 
      protein phosphatase 2A- and mammalian target of rapamycin-dependent manner. Our 
      data indicate that pathological CAG repeat expansions upregulate protein 
      translation leading to an overproduction of aberrant protein and suggest that the 
      MID1-complex may serve as a therapeutic target for the treatment of CAG repeat 
      expansion disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder, caused by a CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion, which 
      is associated with a dysregulation of histone function and an impairment of 
      protein transcription. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, such as vorinostat 
      (SAHA), have shown promise as therapeutic agents. However, there have been few 
      studies on the expression of HDACs and acetylated core histones (AcHs) in either 
      normal animals or humans, or in HD patients or HD animal models. Therefore, we 
      investigated the expression of HDACs and AcHs in HD brain by 
      immunohistochemistry, and have compared findings with elderly control subjects 
      and patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) to determine whether 
      any observed changes were specific for HD. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: we show 
      specific and significant losses of AcH2A, AcH2B, AcH3 and AcH4 expression from 
      cells in the caudate nucleus and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum in HD compared 
      to patients with FTLD and control subjects, while the level of HDAC 5 was 
      increased in these cells.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Brain-type creatine kinase 
      (CKB) is an enzyme involved in energy homeostasis via the 
      phosphocreatine-creatine kinase system. Although downregulation of CKB was 
      previously reported in brains of HD mouse models and patients, such regulation 
      and its functional consequence in HD are not fully understood. In the present 
      study, we demonstrated that levels of CKB found in both the soma and processes 
      were markedly reduced in primary neurons and brains of HD mice. We show for the 
      first time that mutant HTT (mHTT) suppressed the activity of the promoter of the 
      CKB gene, which contributes to the lowered CKB expression in HD. Exogenous 
      expression of wild-type CKB, but not a dominant negative CKB mutant, rescued the 
      ATP depletion, aggregate formation, impaired proteasome activity, and shortened 
      neurites induced by mHTT. These findings suggest that negative regulation of CKB 
      by mHTT is a key event in the pathogenesis of HD and contributes to the neuronal 
      dysfunction associated with HD. In addition, besides dietary supplementation with 
      the CKB substrate, strategies aimed at increasing CKB expression might lead to 
      the development of therapeutic treatments for HD.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by polyglutamine repeat expansions in Ataxin-1. Recent evidence 
      supports a role for microRNAs (miRNAs) deregulation in SCA1 pathogenesis. 
      However, the extent to which miRNAs may modulate the onset, progression or 
      severity of SCA1 remains largely unknown. In this study, we used a mouse model of 
      SCA1 to determine if miRNAs are misregulated in pre- and post-symptomatic SCA1 
      cerebellum. We found a significant alteration in the steady-state levels of 
      numerous miRNAs prior to and following phenotypic onset. In addition, we provide 
      evidence that increased miR-150 levels in SCA1 Purkinje neurons may modulate 
      disease pathogenesis by targeting the expression of Rgs8 and Vegfa.

TI  - A critical role of astrocyte-mediated nuclear factor-kappaB-dependent inflammation in 
      Huntington's disease.
PG  - 1826-42
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddt036 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal disease caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. The resultant mutant HTT protein (mHTT) 
      forms aggregates in various types of cells, including neurons and glial cells and 
      preferentially affects brain function. We found that two HD mouse models 
      (Hdh(150Q) and R6/2) were more susceptible than wild-type (WT) mice to 
      lipopolysaccharide-evoked systemic inflammation and produced more proinflammatory 
      cytokines in the brain. Such an enhanced inflammatory response in the brain was 
      not observed in N171- 82Q mice that express mHTT only in neurons, but not in 
      glial cells. Thus, HD glia might play an important role in chronic inflammation 
      that accelerates disease progression in HD mice. Intriguingly, enhanced 
      activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-p65 (p65), a transcriptional mediator of 
      inflammatory responses, was observed in astrocytes of patients and mice with HD. 
      Results obtained using primary R6/2 astrocytes suggest that these cells exhibited 
      higher IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity that caused prolongation of NF-kappaB activation, 
      thus upregulating proinflammatory factors during inflammation. R6/2 astrocytes 
      also produced a more-damaging effect on primary R6/2 neurons than did WT 
      astrocytes during inflammation. Blockage of IKK reduced the neuronal toxicity 
      caused by R6/2 astrocytes and ameliorated several HD symptoms of R6/2 mice (e.g. 
      decreased neuronal density, impaired motor coordination and poor cognitive 
      function). Collectively, our results indicate that enhancement of the 
      p65-mediated inflammatory response in astrocytes contributes to HD pathogenesis. 
      Therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing neuronal inflammation may be an 
      important strategy for treating HD.

TI  - Aberrant splicing of HTT generates the pathogenic exon 1 protein in Huntington 
      disease.
PG  - 2366-70
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1221891110 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating, late-onset, inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder that manifests with personality changes, movement disorders, and 
      cognitive decline. It is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the HTT 
      gene that translates to a polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein (HTT). 
      The formation of HTT fragments has been implicated as an essential step in the 
      molecular pathogenesis of HD and several proteases that cleave HTT have been 
      identified. However, the importance of smaller N-terminal fragments has been 
      highlighted by their presence in HD postmortem brains and by the fact that 
      nuclear inclusions are only detected by antibodies to the N terminus of HTT. 
      Despite an intense research effort, the precise length of these fragments and the 
      mechanism by which they are generated remains unknown. Here we show that CAG 
      repeat length-dependent aberrant splicing of exon 1 HTT results in a short 
      polyadenylated mRNA that is translated into an exon 1 HTT protein. Given that 
      mutant exon 1 HTT proteins have consistently been shown to be highly pathogenic 
      in HD mouse models, the aberrant splicing of HTT mRNA provides a mechanistic 
      basis for the molecular pathogenesis of HD. RNA-targeted therapeutic strategies 
      designed to lower the levels of HTT are under development. Many of these 
      approaches would not prevent the production of exon 1 HTT and should be reviewed 
      in light of our findings.

TI  - Study of the association of serotonin transporter triallelic 5-HTTLPR and STin2 
      VNTR polymorphisms with lithium prophylaxis response in bipolar disorder.
PG  - 77-81
LID - 10.1097/YPG.0b013e32835d6fad [doi]
AB  - The 5-hydroxy tryptamine transporter (5-HTT) gene has been previously implicated 
      in lithium response, but the roles of the triallelic 5-HTT linked promoter region 
      (5-HTTLPR) and variable number tandem repeats in the second intron [serotonin 
      transporter intron 2 (STin2)] have not been reported. We examined these 
      polymorphisms in 122 patients with bipolar I disorder, among which 49 patients 
      were classified as good responders, 49 as nonresponders, and 24 as partial 
      responders to lithium prophylaxis. We observed significant variation in the 
      genotype frequencies of STin2 polymorphism among the response groups (P=0.02). 
      There was also a significant association of haplotype consisting of the S allele 
      of 5-HTTLPR and 10 repeat allele of STin2 with lithium response (P=0.01) and no 
      such relationship was found with 5-HTTLPR variants. Our data support preliminary 
      information of a possible association of STin2 and its combined effect with 
      5-HTTLPR variants with lithium response and also suggest that lithium is likely 
      to be more effective for patients carrying 5-HTT polymorphisms associated with 
      reduced transcriptional activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been epidemiological studies of Huntington's disease (HD) 
      in various populations and nations. Only a few studies describing clinical 
      characteristics have been reported in Asia. OBJECTIVE: To conduct preliminary 
      analyses of demographic, clinical and genetic characteristics of HD in South 
      Korea. METHODS: From 1994 to 2011, thirty six subjects were diagnosed as HD in 
      Seoul National University Hospital. Demographic, clinical and genetic data were 
      carefully analyzed in all subjects. RESULTS: Mean age of onset was 46.5 +/- 12.7 
      years and mean expanded CAG repeat size was 45.4 +/- 4.7. Twenty-eight subjects 
      (80%) had a family history of HD. Chorea was the most frequent symptom at first 
      visit (89%). Proportion of cognitive decline (36%) and psychiatric symptom (28%) 
      at first visit were lower than proportion of previous reports. A negative 
      correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient -0.757, p = 0.001) was found between 
      expanded CAG repeat size and age of onset. Seven subjects without family history 
      of HD had higher mean age of onset (54.0 +/- 8.1) and smaller expanded CAG repeat 
      size (42.4 +/- 2.7). Cognitive problems at first visit of subjects without family 
      history were more prominent than those with family history (86% vs. 25%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first demographic, clinical and genetic analyses 
      in South Korea. These results will be helpful to stimulate more large-scale 
      research in South Korea and other Asian nations.

AB  - We recently reported a significant increase in the frequency of carriers of grey 
      zone (GZ) alleles of FMR1 gene in Australian males with Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      from Victoria and Tasmania. Here, we report data comparing an independent sample 
      of 817 PD patients from Queensland to 1078 consecutive Australian male newborns 
      from Victoria. We confirmed the earlier finding by observing a significant excess 
      of GZ alleles in PD (4.8%) compared to controls (1.5%). Although both studies 
      provided evidence in support of an association between GZ-carrier status and 
      increased risk for parkinsonism, the existing evidence in the literature from 
      screening studies remains equivocal and we discuss the need for alternative 
      approaches to resolve the issue.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) 
      result in engraftment of donor stem cells in the recipient uterus. DESIGN: 
      Prospective clinical and laboratory research. SETTING: Translational medicine 
      research hospital. PATIENT(S)/ANIMAL(S): Macaque and human bone marrow transplant 
      recipients. INTERVENTION(S): Rhesus macaques received autologous transduced 
      immunoselected cytokine-mobilized CD34+ cells after total body irradiation. 
      Vector constructs expressed green fluorescent protein. In the human subjects, 
      prior PBSCT subjects underwent endometrial biopsy and bone marrow aspiration. 
      Macaque and human endometrial and bone marrow cells were isolated and cultured. 
      Fluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were 
      used to evaluate for the presence of donor-derived cells. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE(S): Presence of donor cells in recipient endometrium and bone marrow 
      stroma. RESULT(S): The macaque endometrial cells did not exhibit evidence of 
      green fluorescent protein labeling. Human endometrial cells were cultured and the 
      absence of donor blood contamination was verified. The PCR evaluation of the 
      human endometrial cells did not demonstrate evidence of donor short tandem 
      repeats. CONCLUSION(S): The PBSCT did not result in engraftment of donor-derived 
      cells in the endometrium.

AB  - We present a unique thirty-nine year old woman with both Huntington's disease 
      (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10). She has 48 CAG repeats in the HD 
      gene and 2511 ATTCT repeats in the ATX10 gene. Although both conditions are 
      repeat expansion diseases they are thought to have quite different pathogenic 
      mechanisms. The symptomatic age of onset in this patient (mid30s) is within the 
      expected range for her repeat expansion sizes for each condition, but we discuss 
      the evidence that the two conditions may interact to produce a more severe 
      cognitive phenotype than would be expected for either of the conditions 
      independently. The subject has Amerindian background on the maternal side from 
      Colombia, South America, thus adding a 5th country expressing SCA10, all with 
      Amerindian ancestry.

TI  - The differential diagnosis of Huntington's disease-like syndromes: 'red flags' 
      for the clinician.
PG  - 650-6
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2012-302532 [doi]
AB  - A growing number of progressive heredodegenerative conditions mimic the 
      presentation of Huntington's disease (HD). Differentiating among these HD-like 
      syndromes is necessary when a patient with a combination of movement disorders, 
      cognitive decline, behavioural abnormalities and progressive disease course 
      proves negative to the genetic testing for HD causative mutations, that is, IT15 
      gene trinucleotide-repeat expansion. The differential diagnosis of HD-like 
      syndromes is complex and may lead to unnecessary and costly investigations. We 
      propose here a guide to this differential diagnosis focusing on a limited number 
      of clinical features ('red flags') that can be identified through accurate 
      clinical examination, collection of historical data and a few routine ancillary 
      investigations. These features include the ethnic background of the patient, the 
      involvement of the facio-bucco-lingual and cervical district by the movement 
      disorder, the co-occurrence of cerebellar features and seizures, the presence of 
      peculiar gait patterns and eye movement abnormalities, and an atypical 
      progression of illness. Additional help may derive from the cognitive-behavioural 
      presentation of the patient, as well as by a restricted number of ancillary 
      investigations, mainly MRI and routine blood tests. These red flags should be 
      constantly updated as the phenotypic characterisation and identification of more 
      reliable diagnostic markers for HD-like syndromes progress over the following 
      years.

AB  - Over two decades, a 42-year old woman experienced the gradual onset of choreic 
      involuntary movements, dystonia, and tics. Decreased caudate nucleus metabolism 
      on 2-deoxyglucose PET scan and a heterozygous 49-CAG repeat expansion within the 
      HTT gene established the diagnosis of HD, although no other family history was 
      known. An axillary skin biopsy revealed a distinctive abnormality of mitochondria 
      limited to the apocrine secretory cells on electron microscopy. All mitochondria 
      were transformed into rounded structures with disrupted cristae and prominent 
      myelin figures; many were enlarged up to 4 times the normal. Cytoplasm of 
      apocrine secretory cells showed an abundance of lipid vacuoles, empty vesicles, 
      and dense bodies. Biopsied skeletal muscle histology (light microscopy) was 
      normal, as was a mitochondrial metabolism study. Biopsies from other HD patients 
      have shown similar mitochondrial changes in cerebral neurons, muscle, 
      fibroblasts, and lymphoblasts, adding to evidence for a systemic disturbance of 
      mitochondria in HD.

AB  - Huntington's Disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) triplet repeat-expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) 
      gene. Diagnosis of HD is classically defined by the presence of motor symptoms; 
      however, cognitive and depressive symptoms frequently precede motor 
      manifestations, and may occur early in the prodromal phase. There are sparse data 
      so far on functional brain correlates of depressive symptoms in prodromal HD. A 
      Stroop color-naming test was administered to 32 subjects in the prodromal phase 
      of HD and 52 expansion-negative controls while performing functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging at 3Tesla. Networks of functional connectivity were identified 
      using group independent component analysis, followed by an analysis of functional 
      network interactions. A contrast of temporal regression-based beta-weights was 
      calculated as a reflection of Stroop-interference related activity and correlated 
      with Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scores. For secondary 
      analysis, patients were stratified into two subgroups by median split of CAG 
      repeat-length. Stroop performance was independent of HTT mutation-carrier status 
      and CES-D score. Stroop-interference-related activity of the ventromedial 
      prefrontal cortex-node of the default-mode network, calculated by 
      temporal-regression beta-weights, was more highly correlated with depressive 
      symptoms in subjects in the prodromal phase of HD than in controls, differing 
      significantly. The strength of this correlation and its difference from controls 
      increased when a subgroup of patients with longer CAG repeat lengths was 
      analyzed. These findings suggest that depressive symptoms in prodromal HD 
      subjects may reflect altered functional brain network activity in the context of 
      early HD-related brain alterations.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansions. We show here that somatic TNR expansions 
      are significantly reduced in several organs of R6/1 mice lacking exon 2 of 
      Nei-like 1 (Neil1) (R6/1/Neil1(-/-)), when compared with R6/1/Neil1(+/+) mice. 
      Somatic TNR expansion is measured by two different methods, namely mean repeat 
      change and instability index. Reduced somatic expansions are more pronounced in 
      male R6/1/Neil1(-/-) mice, although expansions are also significantly reduced in 
      brain regions of female R6/1/Neil1(-/-) mice. In addition, we show that the lack 
      of functional Neil1 significantly reduces germline expansion in R6/1 male mice. 
      In vitro, purified human NEIL1 protein binds and excises 5-hydroxycytosine in 
      duplex DNA more efficiently than in hairpin substrates. NEIL1 excision of 
      cytosine-derived oxidative lesions could therefore be involved in initiating the 
      process of TNR expansion, although other DNA modifications might also contribute. 
      Altogether, these results imply that Neil1 contributes to germline and somatic HD 
      CAG repeat expansion.

TI  - Monomorphic region of the serotonin transporter promoter gene in New World 
      monkeys.
PG  - 1028-34

AB  - Genetic variation in the human serotonin system has long been studied because of 
      its functional consequences and links to various neuropsychiatric and 
      behavior-related disorders. Among non-human primates, the common marmosets 
      (Callithrix jacchus) and tufted capuchins monkeys (Cebus apella) are becoming 
      increasingly used as models to study the effects of genes, environments, and 
      their interaction on physiology and complex behavior. In order to investigate the 
      independent functions of and potential interactions between serotonin-related 
      genes, anxiety and neuropsychiatric disorders, we analyzed the presence and 
      variability of the serotonin transporter gene-linked polymorphic region 
      (5-HTTLPR) in marmoset and capuchin monkeys. By PCR and using heterologous 
      primers from the human sequence, we amplified and then sequenced the 
      corresponding 5-HTT region in marmosets and capuchins. The resulting data 
      revealed the presence of a tandem repeat sequence similar to that described in 
      humans, but unlike humans and other Old World primates, no variable length 
      alleles were detected in these New World monkeys, suggesting that if serotonin 
      transporter is involved in modulating behavior in these animals it does so 
      through different molecular mechanisms.

TI  - Replacement of huntingtin exon 1 by trans-splicing.
PG  - 4191-204
LID - 10.1007/s00018-012-1083-5 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by polyglutamine expansion in the amino-terminus of huntingtin (HTT). HD 
      offers unique opportunities for promising RNA-based therapeutic approaches aimed 
      at reducing mutant HTT expression, since the HD mutation is considered to be a 
      "gain-of-function" mutation. Allele-specific strategies that preserve expression 
      from the wild-type allele and reduce the levels of mutant protein would be of 
      particular interest. Here, we have conducted proof-of-concept studies to 
      demonstrate that spliceosome-mediated trans-splicing is a viable molecular 
      strategy to specifically repair the HTT allele. We employed a dual plasmid 
      transfection system consisting of a pre-mRNA trans-splicing module (PTM) 
      containing HTT exon 1 and a HTT minigene to demonstrate that HTT exon 1 can be 
      replaced in trans. We detected the presence of the trans-spliced RNA in which PTM 
      exon 1 was correctly joined to minigene exons 2 and 3. Furthermore, exon 1 from 
      the PTM was trans-spliced to the endogenous HTT pre-mRNA in cultured cells as 
      well as disease-relevant models, including HD patient fibroblasts and primary 
      neurons from a previously described HD mouse model. These results suggest that 
      the repeat expansion of HTT can be repaired successfully not only in the context 
      of synthetic minigenes but also within the context of HD neurons. Therefore, 
      pre-mRNA trans-splicing may be a promising approach for the treatment of HD and 
      other dominant genetic disorders.

TI  - Initiation of 8-oxoguanine base excision repair within trinucleotide tandem 
      repeats.
PG  - 270-9
LID - 10.1134/S0006297912030054 [doi]
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansion provides a molecular basis for several devastating 
      neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, expansion of a CAG run in the human 
      HTT gene causes Huntington's disease. One of the main reasons for triplet repeat 
      expansion in somatic cells is base excision repair (BER), involving damaged base 
      excision and repair DNA synthesis that may be accompanied by expansion of the 
      repaired strand due to formation of noncanonical DNA structures. We have analyzed 
      the kinetics of excision of a ubiquitously found oxidized purine base, 
      8-oxoguanine (oxoG), by DNA glycosylase OGG1 from the substrates containing a CAG 
      run flanked by AT-rich sequences. The values of k(2) rate constant for the 
      removal of oxoG from triplets in the middle of the run were higher than for oxoG 
      at the flanks of the run. The value of k(3) rate constant dropped starting from 
      the third CAG-triplet in the run and remained stable until the 3'-terminal 
      triplet, where it decreased even more. In nuclear extracts, the profile of oxoG 
      removal rate along the run resembled the profile of k(2) constant, suggesting 
      that the reaction rate in the extracts is limited by base excision. The fully 
      reconstituted BER was efficient with all substrates unless oxoG was near the 
      3'-flank of the run, interfering with the initiation of the repair. DNA 
      polymerase beta was able to perform a strand-displacement DNA synthesis, which may 
      be important for CAG run expansion initiated by BER.

PG  - 142ra97
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.3003799 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by CAG repeat expansions in the huntingtin 
      (htt) gene, yielding proteins containing polyglutamine repeats that become 
      misfolded and resist degradation. Previous studies demonstrated that mutant htt 
      interferes with transcriptional programs coordinated by the peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), a regulator of 
      mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative stress. We tested whether restoration of 
      PGC-1alpha could ameliorate the symptoms of HD in a mouse model. We found that PGC-1alpha 
      induction virtually eliminated htt protein aggregation and ameliorated HD 
      neurodegeneration in part by attenuating oxidative stress. PGC-1alpha promoted htt 
      turnover and the elimination of protein aggregates by activating transcription 
      factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway. TFEB 
      alone was capable of reducing htt aggregation and neurotoxicity, placing PGC-1alpha 
      upstream of TFEB and identifying these two molecules as important therapeutic 
      targets in HD and potentially other neurodegenerative disorders caused by protein 
      misfolding.

AB  - Reading disability (RD) is a complex genetic disorder with unknown etiology. 
      Genes on chromosome 6p22, including DCDC2, KIAA0319, and TTRAP, have been 
      identified as RD associated genes. Imaging studies have shown both functional and 
      structural differences between brains of individuals with and without RD. There 
      are limited association studies performed between RD genes, specifically genes on 
      6p22, and regional brain activation during reading tasks. Using fourteen variants 
      in DCDC2, KIAA0319, and TTRAP and exhaustive reading measures, we first tested 
      for association with reading performance in 82 parent-offspring families (326 
      individuals). Next, we determined the association of these variants with 
      activation of sixteen brain regions of interest during four functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging-reading tasks. We nominally replicated associations between 
      reading performance and variants of DCDC2 and KIAA0319. Furthermore, we observed 
      a number of associations with brain activation patterns during imaging-reading 
      tasks with all three genes. The strongest association occurred between activation 
      of the left anterior inferior parietal lobe and complex tandem repeat BV677278 in 
      DCDC2 (uncorrected p=0.00003, q=0.0442). Our results show that activation 
      patterns across regions of interest in the brain are influenced by variants in 
      the DYX2 locus. The combination of genetic and functional imaging data show a 
      link between genes and brain functioning during reading tasks in subjects with 
      RD. This study highlights the many advantages of imaging data as an endophenotype 
      for discerning genetic risk factors for RD and other communication disorders and 
      underscores the importance of integrating neurocognitive, imaging, and genetic 
      data in future investigations.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by an 
      expanded stretch of CAG trinucleotide repeats that results in neuronal 
      dysfunction and death. Here, The HD Consortium reports the generation and 
      characterization of 14 induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from HD 
      patients and controls. Microarray profiling revealed 
      CAG-repeat-expansion-associated gene expression patterns that distinguish patient 
      lines from controls, and early onset versus late onset HD. Differentiated HD 
      neural cells showed disease-associated changes in electrophysiology, metabolism, 
      cell adhesion, and ultimately cell death for lines with both medium and longer 
      CAG repeat expansions. The longer repeat lines were however the most vulnerable 
      to cellular stressors and BDNF withdrawal, as assessed using a range of assays 
      across consortium laboratories. The HD iPSC collection represents a unique and 
      well-characterized resource to elucidate disease mechanisms in HD and provides a 
      human stem cell platform for screening new candidate therapeutics.

TI  - Mitigation of augmented extrasynaptic NMDAR signaling and apoptosis in 
      cortico-striatal co-cultures from Huntington's disease mice.
PG  - 40-51
LID - 10.1016/j.nbd.2012.05.013 [doi]
AB  - We recently reported evidence for disturbed synaptic versus extrasynaptic NMDAR 
      transmission in the early pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD), a late-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG repeat expansion in the gene encoding 
      huntingtin. Studies in glutamatergic cells indicate that synaptic NMDAR 
      transmission increases phosphorylated cyclic-AMP response element binding protein 
      (pCREB) levels and drives neuroprotective gene transcription, whereas 
      extrasynaptic NMDAR activation reduces pCREB and promotes cell death. By 
      generating striatal and cortical neuronal co-cultures to investigate the 
      glutamatergic innervation of striatal neurons, we demonstrate that dichotomous 
      synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDAR signaling also occurs in GABAergic striatal 
      medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs), which are acutely vulnerable in HD. Further, 
      we show that wild-type (WT) and HD transgenic YAC128 MSNs co-cultured with 
      cortical cells have similar levels of glutamatergic synapses, synaptic NMDAR 
      currents and synaptic GluN2B and GluN2A subunit-containing NMDARs. However, NMDAR 
      whole-cell, and especially extrasynaptic, current is elevated in YAC128 MSNs. 
      Moreover, GluN2B subunit-containing NMDAR surface expression is markedly 
      increased, irrespective of whether or not the co-cultured cortical cells express 
      mutant huntingtin. The data suggest that MSN cell-autonomous increases in 
      extrasynaptic NMDARs are driven by the HD mutation. Consistent with these 
      results, we find that extrasynaptic NMDAR-induced pCREB reductions and apoptosis 
      are also augmented in YAC128 MSNs. Moreover, both NMDAR-mediated apoptosis and 
      CREB-off signaling are blocked by co-application of either memantine or the 
      GluN2B subunit-selective antagonist ifenprodil in YAC128 MSNs. 
      GluN2A-subunit-selective concentrations of the antagonist NVP-AAM077 did not 
      reduce cell death in either genotype. Cortico-striatal co-cultures provide an in 
      vitro model system in which to better investigate striatal neuronal dysfunction 
      in disease than mono-cultured striatal cells. Results from the use of this 
      system, which partially recapitulates the cortico-striatal circuit and is 
      amenable to acute genetic and pharmacological manipulations, suggest that 
      pathophysiological NMDAR signaling is an intrinsic frailty in HD MSNs that can be 
      successfully targeted by pharmacological interventions.

      disease.
PG  - 895-902

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early 
      cognitive decline that progresses at later stages to dementia and severe movement 
      disorder. HD is caused by a cytosine-adenine-guanine triplet-repeat expansion 
      mutation in the Huntingtin gene, allowing early diagnosis by genetic testing. 
      This study aimed to identify the relationship of N-acetylaspartate and other 
      brain metabolites to cognitive function in HD-mutation carriers by using 
      high-field-strength magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 7 Tesla. Twelve 
      individuals with the HD mutation in premanifest or early-stage disease versus 12 
      healthy controls underwent (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (7.2 mL voxel in 
      the posterior cingulate cortex) at 7 Tesla, and also T1-weighted structural 
      magnetic resonance imaging. All participants received standardized tests of 
      cognitive functioning including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and 
      standardized quantified neurological examination within an hour before scanning. 
      Individuals with the HD mutation had significantly lower posterior cingulate 
      cortex N-acetylaspartate (-9.6%, P = .02) and glutamate (-10.1%, P = .02) levels 
      than did controls. In contrast, in this small group, measures of brain morphology 
      including striatal and ventricle volumes did not differ significantly. Linear 
      regression with Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores revealed significant 
      correlations with N-acetylaspartate (r(2) = 0.50, P = .01) and glutamate (NAA) 
      (r(2) = 0.64, P = .002) in HD subjects. Our data suggest a relationship between 
      reduced N-acetylaspartate and glutamate levels in the posterior cingulate cortex 
      with cognitive decline in the early stages of HD. N-acetylaspartate and glutamate 
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy signals of the posterior cingulate cortex region 
      may serve as potential biomarkers of disease progression or treatment outcome in 
      HD and other neurodegenerative disorders with early cognitive dysfunction, when 
      structural brain changes are still minor.

PG  - 2060-4
LID - 10.1002/pmic.201100380 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a CAG triplet repeat expansion in exon 1 
      of the Huntingtin (Htt) gene, encoding an abnormal expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) 
      tract that confers toxicity to the mutant Htt (mHtt) protein. Recent data suggest 
      that posttranslational modifications of mHtt modulate its cytotoxicity. To 
      further understand the cytotoxic mechanisms of mHtt, we have generated HEK293 
      cell models stably expressing Strep- and FLAG-tagged Htt containing either 19Q 
      (wild-type Htt), 55Q (mHtt), or 94Q (mHtt) repeats. Following tandem affinity 
      purification, the tagged Htt and associated proteins were subjected to tandem 
      mass spectrometry or 2D nano-LC tandem mass spectrometry and several novel 
      modification sites of mHtt containing 55Q or 94Q were identified. These were 
      phosphorylation sites located at Ser431 and Ser432, and ubiquitination site 
      located at Lys444. The two phosphorylation sites were confirmed by Western blot 
      analysis using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies. In addition, prevention 
      of phosphorylation at the two serine sites altered mHtt toxicity and 
      accumulation. These modifications of mHtt may provide novel therapeutic targets 
      for effective treatment of the disorder.

      psychiatric symptoms. There is currently no cure for this progressive and fatal 
      disorder. The causative mutation of this hereditary disease is a trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion (CAG) in the Huntingtin gene that results in an expanded 
      polyglutamine tract. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain the 
      preferential striatal and cortical degeneration that occurs with HD, including 
      non-cell-autonomous contribution from astrocytes. Although numerous cell culture 
      and animal models exist, there is a great need for experimental systems that can 
      more accurately replicate the human disease. Human induced pluripotent stem cells 
      (iPSCs) are a remarkable new tool to study neurological disorders because this 
      cell type can be derived from patients as a renewable, genetically tractable 
      source for unlimited cells that are difficult to acquire, such as neurons and 
      astrocytes. The development of experimental systems based on iPSC technology 
      could aid in the identification of molecular lesions and therapeutic treatments. 
      RESULTS: We derived iPSCs from a father with adult onset HD and 50 CAG repeats 
      (F-HD-iPSC) and his daughter with juvenile HD and 109 CAG repeats (D-HD-iPSC). 
      These disease-specific iPSC lines were characterized by standard assays to assess 
      the quality of iPSC lines and to demonstrate their pluripotency. HD-iPSCs were 
      capable of producing phenotypically normal, functional neurons in vitro and were 
      able to survive and differentiate into neurons in the adult mouse brain in vivo 
      after transplantation. Surprisingly, when HD-iPSCs were directed to differentiate 
      into an astrocytic lineage, we observed the presence of cytoplasmic, electron 
      clear vacuoles in astrocytes from both F-HD-iPSCs and D-HD-iPSCs, which were 
      significantly more pronounced in D-HD-astrocytes. Remarkably, the vacuolation in 
      diseased astrocytes was observed under basal culture conditions without 
      additional stressors and increased over time. Importantly, similar vacuolation 
      phenotype has also been observed in peripheral blood lymphocytes from individuals 
      with HD. Together, these data suggest that vacuolation may be a phenotype 
      associated with HD. CONCLUSIONS: We have generated a unique in vitro system to 
      study HD pathogenesis using patient-specific iPSCs. The astrocytes derived from 
      patient-specific iPSCs exhibit a vacuolation phenotype, a phenomenon previously 
      documented in primary lymphocytes from HD patients. Our studies pave the way for 
      future mechanistic investigations using human iPSCs to model HD and for 
      high-throughput therapeutic screens.

TI  - Transducer of regulated CREB-binding proteins (TORCs) transcription and function 
      is impaired in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 3474-88

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable neurological disorder caused by an 
      abnormal glutamine repeat expansion in the huntingtin (Htt) protein. In the 
      present studies, we investigated the role of Transducers of Regulated cAMP 
      response element-binding (CREB) protein activity (TORCs) in HD, since TORCs play 
      an important role in the expression of the transcriptional co-regulator 
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), whose 
      expression is impaired in HD. We found significantly decreased TORC1 expression 
      levels in STHdhQ111 cells expressing mutant Htt, in the striatum of NLS-N171-82Q, 
      R6/2 and HdhQ111 HD transgenic mice and in postmortem striatal tissue from HD 
      patients. TORC1 overexpression in wild-type (WT) and Htt striatal cells increased 
      CREB mRNA and protein levels, PGC-1alpha promoter activity, mRNA expression of the 
      PGC-1alpha, NRF-1, Tfam and CytC genes, mitochondrial DNA content, mitochondrial 
      activity and mitochondrial membrane potential. TORC1 overexpression also 
      increased the resistance of striatal cells to 3-nitropropionic (3-NP) 
      acid-mediated toxicity. In cultured WT and mutant Htt striatal cells, small 
      hairpin RNA-mediated TORC1 knockdown resulted in decreased PGC-1alpha expression and 
      increased susceptibility to 3-NP-induced toxicity. Overexpression of PGC-1alpha 
      partially prevented TORC1 knockdown-mediated increased susceptibility of Htt 
      striatal cells to 3-NP. Specific knockdown of TORC1 in the striatum of 
      NLS-N171-82Q HD transgenic mice induced neurodegeneration. Lastly, knockdown of 
      Htt prevents transcriptional repression of TORC1 and CREB in Htt striatal cells. 
      These findings show that impaired expression and function of TORC1, which results 
      in a reduction in PGC-1alpha, plays an important role in mitochondrial dysfunction in 
      HD.

TI  - Deregulation of BRCA1 leads to impaired spatiotemporal dynamics of gamma-H2AX and DNA 
      damage responses in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 550-63
LID - 10.1007/s12035-012-8274-9 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder of 
      mid-life onset characterized by involuntary movements and progressive cognitive 
      decline caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the Huntingtin (Htt) gene. 
      Neuronal DNA damage is one of the major features of neurodegeneration in HD, but 
      it is not known how it arises or relates to the triplet repeat expansion mutation 
      in the Htt gene. Herein, we found that imbalanced levels of non-phosphorylated 
      and phosphorylated BRCA1 contribute to the DNA damage response in HD. Notably, 
      nuclear foci of gamma-H2AX, the molecular component that recruits various DNA damage 
      repair factors to damage sites including BRCA1, were deregulated when DNA was 
      damaged in HD cell lines. BRCA1 specifically interacted with gamma-H2AX via the BRCT 
      domain, and this association was reduced in HD. BRCA1 overexpression restored 
      gamma-H2AX level in the nucleus of HD cells, while BRCA1 knockdown reduced the 
      spatiotemporal propagation of gamma-H2AX foci to the nucleoplasm. The deregulation of 
      BRCA1 correlated with an abnormal nuclear distribution of gamma-H2AX in striatal 
      neurons of HD transgenic (R6/2) mice and BRCA1(+/-) mice. Our data indicate that 
      BRCA1 is required for the efficient focal recruitment of gamma-H2AX to the sites of 
      neuronal DNA damage. Taken together, our results show that BRCA1 directly 
      modulates the spatiotemporal dynamics of gamma-H2AX upon genotoxic stress and serves 
      as a molecular maker for neuronal DNA damage response in HD.

      Huntington's disease mice.
PG  - 727-30
LID - 10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.04.070 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Positron emission tomography studies 
      have revealed a decline in glucose metabolism in the brain of patients with HD by 
      a mechanism that has not been established. We examined glucose utilization in 
      embryonic primary cortical neurons of wild-type (WT) and HD knock-in mice, which 
      have 140 CAG repeats inserted in the endogenous mouse huntingtin gene 
      (HD(140Q/140Q)). Primary HD(140Q/140Q) cortical neurons took up significantly 
      less glucose than did WT neurons. Expression of permanently inactive and 
      permanently active forms of Rab11 correspondingly altered glucose uptake in WT 
      neurons, suggesting that normal activity of Rab11 is needed for neuronal uptake 
      of glucose. It is known that Rab11 activity is diminished in HD(140Q/140Q) 
      neurons. Expression of dominant active Rab11 to enhance the activity of Rab11 
      normalized glucose uptake in HD(140Q/140Q) neurons. These results suggest that 
      deficient activity of Rab11 is a novel mechanism for glucose hypometabolism in 
      HD.

TI  - Reduced telomere length in individuals with FMR1 premutations and full mutations.
PG  - 1060-5
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.35275 [doi]
AB  - We reported previously that 10 older men (66.4 +/- 4.6 years) with premutation 
      alleles (55-200 CGG repeats) of the FMR1 gene, with or without FXTAS, had 
      decreased telomere length when compared to sex- and age-matched controls. 
      Extending our use of light intensity measurements from a telomere probe 
      hybridized to interphase preparations, we have now found shortened telomeres in 9 
      younger male premutation carriers (31.7 +/- 17.6 years). We have also shown 
      decreased telomere length in T lymphocytes from 6 male individuals (12.0 +/- 1.8 
      years) with full mutation FMR1 alleles (>200 CGG repeats). These findings support 
      our hypothesis that reduced telomere length is a component of the sub-cellular 
      pathology of FMR1-associated disorders. The experimental approach involved 
      pair-wise comparisons of light intensity values of 20 cells from an individual 
      with either premutation or full mutation CGG-repeat expansions relative to an 
      equivalent number of cells from a sex- and age-matched control. In addition, we 
      demonstrated reduced telomere size in T-lymphocyte cultures from eight 
      individuals with the FMR1 premutation using six different measures. Four relied 
      on detection of light intensity differences, and two involved measuring the whole 
      chromosome, including the telomere, in microns. This new approach confirmed our 
      findings with light intensity measurements and demonstrated the feasibility of 
      direct linear measurements for detecting reductions in telomere size. We have 
      thus confirmed our hypothesis that reduced telomere length is associated with 
      both premutation and full mutation-FMR1 alleles and have demonstrated that direct 
      measurements of telomere length can reliably detect such reductions.

TI  - Red/ET recombination with chimeric oligonucleotides allows rapid generation of 
      BAC transgenes harboring full-length or truncated huntingtin cDNA.
LID - 10.2144/000113908 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by 
      a CAG repeat expansion encoding a polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin (htt) 
      gene. None of the existing HD mouse models recapitulate the exact disease 
      symptoms and course as it is seen in humans and the generation of further HD 
      disease models is challenging because of the size and complexity of the htt gene 
      locus. Starting from a single substrate plasmid harboring human htt cDNA 
      comprising 98 glutamine (Q) residues, we applied Red/ET recombination to generate 
      four BDNF-BAC transgenes harboring full-length or truncated (N171) htt cDNA 
      comprising 98 or 15 Q residues. BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) is 
      expressed in the cortical neurons projecting to the striatal medium spiny 
      neurons, and was used to direct htt transgene expression to investigate the 
      contribution of these cell types to HD.

      and visuospatial working memory functioning.
PG  - 667-76
LID - 10.1007/s00406-012-0312-0 [doi]
AB  - Working memory deficits are found in different psychiatric populations and are 
      most pronounced in schizophrenia. There is preliminary evidence from 
      pharmacological studies that the verbal and visuospatial subcomponents of working 
      memory are subject to differential neurotransmitter modulation. Here, we 
      investigated the impact of well-known polymorphisms of the dopamine transporter 
      gene (SLC6A3, DAT) and the catechol-O-methyl-transferase gene (COMT) as well as 
      the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4, 5-HTT) on these specific working memory 
      subcomponents in a mixed sample of patients and healthy individuals. Twenty 
      healthy subjects and 80 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar I 
      disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder underwent genotyping for the DAT 
      variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), the COMT val/met-, and the 5-HTT 
      promoter length polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) and neuropsychological testing using a 
      battery of well-characterized, brain circuit-specific working memory tasks. DAT 
      genotype revealed a significant and selective effect on visuospatial working 
      memory, while there was no effect on verbal working memory functioning. 5-HTT 
      genotype, by contrast, exerted a significant and selective effect on verbal 
      working memory task performance. COMT genotype did not show any influence on 
      either working memory domain. The results of the present study provide evidence 
      for a differential impact of genetic polymorphisms of the dopaminergic and 
      serotonergic systems on verbal and visuospatial working memory functioning. 
      Together with prior evidence suggesting the existence of subgroups of 
      schizophrenia patients exhibiting isolated deficits in only one working memory 
      domain, this finding further supports the idea of endophenotypically and 
      pathophysiologically distinct subgroups of schizophrenia with implications for 
      personalized therapeutic approaches.

      Disease.
PG  - 204-9
LID - 10.1016/j.neulet.2012.02.095 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's Disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG 
      triplet-repeat expansion-mutation in the Huntingtin gene. Subjects at risk for HD 
      can be identified by genetic testing in the prodromal phase. Structural changes 
      of basal-ganglia nuclei such as the caudate nucleus are well-replicated findings 
      observable early in prodromal-HD subjects and may be preceded by distinct 
      functional alterations of cortico-striatal circuits. This study aims to assess 
      functional integrity of the motor system as a cortico-striatal circuit with 
      particular clinical relevance in HD. Ten subjects in the prodromal phase of HD 
      and ten matched controls were administered blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at rest (3T). Functional 
      connectivity was measured as synchrony of BOLD activity between the caudate 
      nucleus and thirteen cortical brain regions (seeds). Basal-ganglia volumes were 
      assessed as established markers of disease progression in prodromal-HD. Linear 
      regression analysis was performed to test for a relationship between structural 
      changes and group differences in functional connectivity. Prodromal-HD subjects 
      showed reduced BOLD synchrony between two seeds in the premotor cortex (BA6) and 
      the caudate nucleus. While similar effect sizes could be observed for reduced 
      basal-ganglia volumes and differences in functional connectivity, coefficients of 
      determination indicate a moderate relationship between functional connectivity 
      and striatal atrophy. Our data show reduced cortico-striatal functional 
      connectivity at rest in prodromal-HD and suggest a relation to early structural 
      brain changes. Additional longitudinal studies are necessary to elucidate the 
      temporal relationship between functional alterations and earliest structural 
      brain changes in prodromal-HD.

TI  - An evaluation of oligonucleotide-based therapeutic strategies for polyQ diseases.
PG  - 6
LID - 10.1186/1471-2199-13-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: RNA interference (RNAi) and antisense strategies provide experimental 
      therapeutic agents for numerous diseases, including polyglutamine (polyQ) 
      disorders caused by CAG repeat expansion. We compared the potential of different 
      oligonucleotide-based strategies for silencing the genes responsible for several 
      polyQ diseases, including Huntington's disease and two spinocerebellar ataxias, 
      type 1 and type 3. The strategies included nonallele-selective gene silencing, 
      gene replacement, allele-selective SNP targeting and CAG repeat targeting. 
      RESULTS: Using the patient-derived cell culture models of polyQ diseases, we 
      tested various siRNAs, and antisense reagents and assessed their silencing 
      efficiency and allele selectivity. We showed considerable allele discrimination 
      by several SNP targeting siRNAs based on a weak G-G or G-U pairing with normal 
      allele and strong G-C pairing with mutant allele at the site of RISC-induced 
      cleavage. Among the CAG repeat targeting reagents the strongest allele 
      discrimination is achieved by miRNA-like functioning reagents that bind to their 
      targets and inhibit their translation without substantial target cleavage. Also, 
      morpholino analog performs well in mutant and normal allele discrimination but 
      its efficient delivery to cells at low effective concentration still remains a 
      challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Using three cellular models of polyQ diseases and the 
      same experimental setup we directly compared the performance of different 
      oligonucleotide-based treatment strategies that are currently under development. 
      Based on the results obtained by us and others we discussed the advantages and 
      drawbacks of these strategies considering them from several different 
      perspectives. The strategy aimed at nonallele-selective inhibiting of causative 
      gene expression by targeting specific sequence of the implicated gene is the 
      easiest to implement but relevant benefits are still uncertain. The gene 
      replacement strategy that combines the nonallele-selective gene silencing with 
      the expression of the exogenous normal allele is a logical extension of the 
      former and it deserves to be explored further. Both allele-selective RNAi 
      approaches challenge cellular RNA interference machinery to show its ability to 
      discriminate between similar sequences differing in either single base 
      substitutions or repeated sequence length. Although both approaches perform well 
      in allele discrimination most of our efforts are focused on repeat targeting due 
      to its potentially higher universality.

TI  - Common SNP-based haplotype analysis of the 4p16.3 Huntington disease gene region.
PG  - 434-44
LID - 10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.01.005 [doi]
AB  - Age at the onset of motor symptoms in Huntington disease (HD) is determined 
      largely by the length of a CAG repeat expansion in HTT but is also influenced by 
      other genetic factors. We tested whether common genetic variation near the 
      mutation site is associated with differences in the distribution of expanded CAG 
      alleles or age at the onset of motor symptoms. To define disease-associated 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we compared 4p16.3 SNPs in HD subjects 
      with population controls in a case:control strategy, which revealed that the 
      strongest signals occurred at a great distance from the HD mutation as a result 
      of "synthetic association" with SNP alleles that are of low frequency in 
      population controls. Detailed analysis delineated a prominent ancestral haplotype 
      that accounted for  approximately 50% of HD chromosomes and extended to at least 938 kb on 
      about half of these. Together, the seven most abundant haplotypes accounted for 
       approximately 83% of HD chromosomes. Neither the extended shared haplotype nor the individual 
      local HTT haplotypes were associated with altered CAG-repeat length distribution 
      or residual age at the onset of motor symptoms, arguing against modification of 
      these disease features by common cis-regulatory elements. Similarly, the 11 most 
      frequent control haplotypes showed no trans-modifier effect on age at the onset 
      of motor symptoms. Our results argue against common local regulatory variation as 
      a factor influencing HD pathogenesis, suggesting that genetic modifiers be sought 
      elsewhere in the genome. They also indicate that genome-wide association analysis 
      with a small number of cases can be effective for regional localization of 
      genetic defects, even when a founder effect accounts for only a fraction of the 
      disorder.

TI  - Loss of junctophilin-3 contributes to Huntington disease-like 2 pathogenesis.
PG  - 245-57
LID - 10.1002/ana.22598 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2) is a progressive, late onset 
      autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, with remarkable similarities to 
      Huntington disease (HD). HDL2 is caused by a CTG/CAG repeat expansion. In the CTG 
      orientation, the repeat is located within the alternatively spliced exon 2A of 
      junctophilin-3 (JPH3), potentially encoding polyleucine and polyalanine, whereas 
      on the strand antisense to JPH3, the repeat is in frame to encode polyglutamine. 
      The JPH3 protein product serves to stabilize junctional membrane complexes and 
      regulate neuronal calcium flux. We have previously demonstrated the potential 
      pathogenic properties of JPH3 transcripts containing expanded CUG repeats. The 
      aim of this study was to test the possibility that loss of JPH3 expression or 
      expanded amino acid tracts also contribute to HDL2 pathogenesis. METHODS: 
      Transcripts from the HDL2 locus, and their protein products, were examined in 
      HDL2, HD, and control frontal cortex. The effect of loss of Jph3 was examined in 
      mice with partial or complete loss of Jph3. RESULTS: Bidirectional transcription 
      occurs at the HDL2 locus, although expression of antisense transcripts with 
      expanded CAG repeats is limited. Protein products with expanded amino acid tracts 
      were not detected in HDL2 brain. However, JPH3 transcripts and full-length JPH3 
      protein are decreased in HDL2 brain, and Jph3 hemizygous and null mice exhibit 
      abnormal motor function. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that the pathogenic 
      mechanism of HDL2 is multifactorial, involving both a toxic gain of function of 
      JPH3 RNA and a toxic loss of JPH3 expression.

TI  - CAG repeat expansion in Huntington disease determines age at onset in a fully 
      dominant fashion.
PG  - 690-5
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0b013e318249f683 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Age at onset of diagnostic motor manifestations in Huntington disease 
      (HD) is strongly correlated with an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat. The length 
      of the normal CAG repeat allele has been reported also to influence age at onset, 
      in interaction with the expanded allele. Due to profound implications for disease 
      mechanism and modification, we tested whether the normal allele, interaction 
      between the expanded and normal alleles, or presence of a second expanded allele 
      affects age at onset of HD motor signs. METHODS: We modeled natural 
      log-transformed age at onset as a function of CAG repeat lengths of expanded and 
      normal alleles and their interaction by linear regression. RESULTS: An apparently 
      significant effect of interaction on age at motor onset among 4,068 subjects was 
      dependent on a single outlier data point. A rigorous statistical analysis with a 
      well-behaved dataset that conformed to the fundamental assumptions of linear 
      regression (e.g., constant variance and normally distributed error) revealed 
      significance only for the expanded CAG repeat, with no effect of the normal CAG 
      repeat. Ten subjects with 2 expanded alleles showed an age at motor onset 
      consistent with the length of the larger expanded allele. CONCLUSIONS: Normal 
      allele CAG length, interaction between expanded and normal alleles, and presence 
      of a second expanded allele do not influence age at onset of motor 
      manifestations, indicating that the rate of HD pathogenesis leading to motor 
      diagnosis is determined by a completely dominant action of the longest expanded 
      allele and as yet unidentified genetic or environmental factors.

TI  - Bifunctional anti-huntingtin proteasome-directed intrabodies mediate efficient 
      degradation of mutant huntingtin exon 1 protein fragments.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a trinucleotide (CAG)(n) repeat expansion in the coding 
      sequence of the huntingtin gene, and an expanded polyglutamine (>37Q) tract in 
      the protein. This results in misfolding and accumulation of huntingtin protein 
      (htt), formation of neuronal intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions, and 
      neuronal dysfunction/degeneration. Single-chain Fv antibodies (scFvs), expressed 
      as intrabodies that bind htt and prevent aggregation, show promise as 
      immunotherapeutics for HD. Intrastriatal delivery of anti-N-terminal htt scFv-C4 
      using an adeno-associated virus vector (AAV2/1) significantly reduces the size 
      and number of aggregates in HDR6/1 transgenic mice; however, this protective 
      effect diminishes with age and time after injection. We therefore explored 
      enhancing intrabody efficacy via fusions to heterologous functional domains. 
      Proteins containing a PEST motif are often targeted for proteasomal degradation 
      and generally have a short half life. In ST14A cells, fusion of the C-terminal 
      PEST region of mouse ornithine decarboxylase (mODC) to scFv-C4 reduces htt exon 1 
      protein fragments with 72 glutamine repeats (httex1-72Q) by ~80-90% when compared 
      to scFv-C4 alone. Proteasomal targeting was verified by either scrambling the 
      mODC-PEST motif, or via proteasomal inhibition with epoxomicin. For these 
      constructs, the proteasomal degradation of the scFv intrabody proteins themselves 
      was reduced<25% by the addition of the mODC-PEST motif, with or without antigens. 
      The remaining intrabody levels were amply sufficient to target N-terminal 
      httex1-72Q protein fragment turnover. Critically, scFv-C4-PEST prevents 
      aggregation and toxicity of httex1-72Q fragments at significantly lower doses 
      than scFv-C4. Fusion of the mODC-PEST motif to intrabodies is a valuable general 
      approach to specifically target toxic antigens to the proteasome for degradation.

TI  - Serotonergic and BDNF genes associated with depression 1 week and 1 year after 
      mastectomy for breast cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Polymorphisms of serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) genes have been investigated as candidate genes for 
      depression occurring in medical disorders. The serotonin 2a receptor (5-HTR2a) 
      genes have been investigated as risk factors for depression but rarely in 
      combination with medical conditions. This study aimed to investigate whether 
      polymorphisms of interest in 5-HTT, 5-HTR2a, and BDNF genes are associated with 
      depression after mastectomy for breast cancer. METHODS: A total of 309 patients 
      with breast cancer were evaluated 1 week after mastectomy, and 244 patients (79%) 
      were followed up 1 year later. Depression (major and minor depressive disorders) 
      was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria using the Mini-International 
      Neuropsychiatric Interview and was classified into prevalent, persistent, and 
      incident depression. Individual associations with 5-HTT gene-linked promoter 
      region, serotonin transporter intron 2 variable number tandem repeat, 5-HTR2a 
      1438A/G, 5-HTR2a 102T/C, and BDNF Val66Met polymorphisms were estimated using 
      logistic regression models, and gene-gene interactions were investigated using 
      the generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction method. RESULTS: At 
      baseline, 74 patients (24%) were classified with prevalent depression, and at 
      follow-up, 19 patients (8%) and 25 patients (10%) were classified with persistent 
      and incident depression, respectively. The BDNF Met/Met genotype was 
      independently associated with prevalent (odds ratio = 2.63, 95% confidence 
      interval = 1.12-6.14) and persistent (odds ratio = 8.07, 95% confidence interval 
      = 1.26-51.6) depression. No associations with 5-HTT and 5-HTR2a genes (all p 
      values > .21) were found, and no significant gene-gene interactions were 
      identified (all p values > .36). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a role of 
      BDNF, not serotonin, in the etiology of depression occurring in women with breast 
      cancer who received a mastectomy.

TI  - A mixed fixed ratio/progressive ratio procedure reveals an apathy phenotype in 
      the BAC HD and the z_Q175 KI mouse models of Huntington's disease.

AB  - Apathy, characterized by generally reduced interest in and likelihood to perform 
      goal-directed actions, is a recognized symptom of Huntington's disease (HD), a 
      devastating neurological disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion of the Htt 
      gene located on chromosome 4. The present experiments used a modified progressive 
      ratio task that incorporated a fixed-ratio schedule of reinforcement component to 
      assess consummatory behavior, and a progressive-ratio schedule component that 
      required increasing numbers of lever-presses for successive reinforcers (0.01 ml 
      of evaporated milk). The studies revealed an apathetic phenotype in two mouse 
      models of HD, with decreased response rates either overall or only at higher 
      ratio requirements in the progressive-ratio component relative to wild-type 
      controls. Based on the procedure used (within-session fixed- and 
      progressive-ratio components), it is proposed that an observed phenotype can be 
      ascribed either specifically to reduced motivation to work for food reinforcement 
      or more generally to deficits in consummatory behavior. This procedure provides a 
      simple means to assess this type of phenotype in rodents, with issues in 
      consummatory vs. incentive motivation reflected in general alterations in fixed- 
      versus progressive alterations on an escalating-ratio schedules respectively, 
      providing translational measures of the amotivation/apathy construct of the human 
      realm to the homologous construct of incentive motivation in preclinical models 
      of human disease.

TI  - Sirt1 mediates neuroprotection from mutant huntingtin by activation of the TORC1 
      and CREB transcriptional pathway.
PG  - 159-65
LID - 10.1038/nm.2559 [doi]
AB  - Sirt1, a NAD-dependent protein deacetylase, has emerged as a key regulator of 
      mammalian transcription in response to cellular metabolic status and stress. Here 
      we show that Sirt1 has a neuroprotective role in models of Huntington's disease, 
      an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a glutamine repeat expansion in 
      huntingtin protein (HTT). Brain-specific knockout of Sirt1 results in 
      exacerbation of brain pathology in a mouse model of Huntington's disease, whereas 
      overexpression of Sirt1 improves survival, neuropathology and the expression of 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in Huntington's disease mice. We show 
      that Sirt1 deacetylase activity directly targets neurons to mediate 
      neuroprotection from mutant HTT. The neuroprotective effect of Sirt1 requires the 
      presence of CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (TORC1), a brain-specific 
      modulator of CREB activity. We show that under normal conditions, Sirt1 
      deacetylates and activates TORC1 by promoting its dephosphorylation and its 
      interaction with CREB. We identified BDNF as a key target of Sirt1 and TORC1 
      transcriptional activity in both normal and Huntington's disease neurons. Mutant 
      HTT interferes with the TORC1-CREB interaction to repress BDNF transcription, and 
      Sirt1 rescues this defect in vitro and in vivo. These studies suggest a key role 
      for Sirt1 in transcriptional networks in both the normal and Huntington's disease 
      brain and offer an opportunity for therapeutic development.

TI  - Polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene of patients with atopic 
      dermatitis-association with personality traits related to high level of anxiety.
PG  - 534-8
LID - 10.3109/08923973.2011.632636 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: The symptoms of atopic dermatitis (AD) are often aggravated by anxiety, 
      and the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) has been shown to be of importance in this 
      context. Three polymorphisms affecting transcription of this gene are known: a 
      repetitive element, in the promoter region (5HTTLPR), a variable number tandem 
      repeats (VNTR) within intron 2 referred to as STin2, and a single-nucleotide 
      (A/G) polymorphism (SNP) located within the 5-HTTLPR. OBJECTIVE: To examine for 
      possible relationships between these polymorphisms and aggravation of AD by 
      stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients with a history of such 
      aggravation, together with 33 age- and gendermatched healthy control subjects, 
      were recruited. The Karolinska Scales of Personality questionnaire was employed 
      to evaluate anxiety-related personality traits and genomic DNA was extracted from 
      blood samples and analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Although 
      the prevalence of the short and long alleles of 5-HTTLPR did not differ between 
      the patients and healthy controls, there was a tendency towards high prevalence 
      of the short (10-copy) variant of STin2 among the patients. When the study 
      population was further analysed by subdivision into subgroups all AD patients 
      with high- anxiety traits carried the short variant of STin2. In the 
      corresponding healthy control group, the prevalences of the 10-and 12-copy 
      variants were 62% and 38%, respectively (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: These findings 
      indicate a possible association between the 10-copy variant of STin2 and 
      aggravation of AD by anxiety.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 cerebellar disease requires the coordinated action 
      of mutant ataxin-7 in neurons and glia, and displays non-cell-autonomous bergmann 
      glia degeneration.
PG  - 16269-78
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4000-11.2011 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a dominantly inherited disorder 
      characterized by cerebellum and brainstem neurodegeneration. SCA7 is caused by a 
      CAG/polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the ataxin-7 gene. We previously 
      reported that directed expression of polyQ-ataxin-7 in Bergmann glia (BG) in 
      transgenic mice leads to ataxia and non-cell-autonomous Purkinje cell (PC) 
      degeneration. To further define the cellular basis of SCA7, we derived a 
      conditional inactivation mouse model by inserting a loxP-flanked ataxin-7 cDNA 
      with 92 repeats into the translational start site of the murine prion protein 
      (PrP) gene in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). The PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q 
      BAC mice developed neurological disease, and exhibited cerebellar degeneration 
      and BG process loss. To inactivate polyQ-ataxin-7 expression in specific 
      cerebellar cell types, we crossed PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q BAC mice with Gfa2-Cre 
      transgenic mice (to direct Cre to BG) or Pcp2-Cre transgenic mice (which yields 
      Cre in PCs and inferior olive). Excision of ataxin-7 from BG partially rescued 
      the behavioral phenotype, but did not prevent BG process loss or molecular layer 
      thinning, while excision of ataxin-7 from PCs and inferior olive provided 
      significantly greater rescue and prevented both pathological changes, revealing a 
      non-cell-autonomous basis for BG pathology. When we prevented expression of 
      mutant ataxin-7 in BG, PCs, and inferior olive by deriving 
      Gfa2-Cre;Pcp2-Cre;PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q BAC triple transgenic mice, we noted a 
      dramatic improvement in SCA7 disease phenotypes. These findings indicate that 
      SCA7 disease pathogenesis involves a convergence of alterations in a variety of 
      different cell types to fully recapitulate the cerebellar degeneration.

TI  - Ser46 phosphorylation and prolyl-isomerase Pin1-mediated isomerization of p53 are 
      key events in p53-dependent apoptosis induced by mutant huntingtin.
PG  - 17979-84
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1106198108 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the gene coding for huntingtin protein. Several mechanisms have been 
      proposed by which mutant huntingtin (mHtt) may trigger striatal 
      neurodegeneration, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and 
      apoptosis. Furthermore, mHtt induces DNA damage and activates a stress response. 
      In this context, p53 plays a crucial role in mediating mHtt toxic effects. Here 
      we have dissected the pathway of p53 activation by mHtt in human neuronal cells 
      and in HD mice, with the aim of highlighting critical nodes that may be 
      pharmacologically manipulated for therapeutic intervention. We demonstrate that 
      expression of mHtt causes increased phosphorylation of p53 on Ser46, leading to 
      its interaction with phosphorylation-dependent prolyl isomerase Pin1 and 
      consequent dissociation from the apoptosis inhibitor iASPP, thereby inducing the 
      expression of apoptotic target genes. Inhibition of Ser46 phosphorylation by 
      targeting homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2), PKCdelta, or ataxia 
      telangiectasia mutated kinase, as well as inhibition of the prolyl isomerase 
      Pin1, prevents mHtt-dependent apoptosis of neuronal cells. These results provide 
      a rationale for the use of small-molecule inhibitors of stress-responsive protein 
      kinases and Pin1 as a potential therapeutic strategy for HD treatment.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS; MIM #300624), a well-recognized form of inherited human 
      mental retardation is caused, in most cases, by a CGG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in the 5'-untranslated region of FMR1, resulting in reduced expression 
      of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Clinical features include 
      macroorchidism, anxiety, mental retardation, motor coordination, and speech 
      articulation deficits. The Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1-KO) mouse, a mouse model for FXS, 
      has been shown to replicate the macroorchidism, cognitive deficits, and 
      neuroanatomical abnormalities found in human FXS. Here we asked whether Fmr1-KO 
      mice also display appendicular and oromotor deficits comparable to the ataxia and 
      dysarthric speech seen in FXS patients. We employed standard motor tests for 
      balance and appendicular motor coordination, and used a novel long-term 
      fluid-licking assay to investigate oromotor function in Fmr1-KO mice and their 
      wild-type (WT) littermates. Fmr1-KO mice performed equally well as their WT 
      littermates on standard motor tests, with the exception of a raised-beam task. 
      However, Fmr1-KO mice had a significantly slower licking rhythm than their WT 
      littermates. Deficits in rhythmic fluid-licking in Fmr1-KO mice have been linked 
      to cerebellar pathologies. It is believed that balance and motor coordination 
      deficits in FXS patients are caused by cerebellar neurophathologies. The neuronal 
      bases of speech articulation deficits in FXS patients are currently unknown. It 
      is yet to be established whether similar neuronal circuits control rhythmic 
      fluid-licking pattern in mice and speech articulation movement in humans.

TI  - NMDA receptor gene variations as modifiers in Huntington disease: a replication 
      study.
PG  - RRN1247
LID - 10.1371/currents.RRN1247 [doi]
LID - RRN1247
AB  - Several candidate modifier genes which, in addition to the pathogenic CAG repeat 
      expansion, influence the age at onset (AO) in Huntington disease (HD) have 
      already been described. The aim of this study was to replicate association of 
      variations in the N-methyl D-aspartate receptor subtype genes GRIN2A and GRIN2B 
      in the "REGISTRY" cohort from the European Huntington Disease Network (EHDN). The 
      analyses did replicate the association reported between the GRIN2A rs2650427 
      variation and AO in the entire cohort. Yet, when subjects were stratified by AO 
      subtypes, we found nominally significant evidence for an association of the 
      GRIN2A rs1969060 variation and the GRIN2B rs1806201 variation. These findings 
      further implicate the N-methyl D-aspartate receptor subtype genes as loci 
      containing variation associated with AO in HD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Serotoninergic dysfunction was reported to be involved in 
      aetiology of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Serotonin (5-HT) is actively cleared 
      from synaptic cleft by serotonin transporter (5-HTT). We investigated the 
      association between three common polymorphisms of 5-HTT gene, which may influence 
      gene expression or function, and risk for TLE. METHODS: Three hundred and 
      thirty-four patients with TLE and four hundred and eighty-seven non-epileptic 
      control subjects from Han Chinese origin were enrolled for the present study. 
      Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) 
      method was used for genotyping. RESULTS: 10-repeat allele frequency of 17 bp 
      variable number of tandem repeats in the second intron (5-HTTVNTR) was moderately 
      higher in patients with TLE than in controls (9.1% vs. 6.1%, P=0.0187, OR=1.55, 
      95%CI=1.07-2.26). CONCLUSION: Our study suggested 10-repeat allele of 5-HTTVNTR 
      may be associated with TLE susceptibility.

TI  - Associations of serotonergic genes with poststroke emotional incontinence.
PG  - 799-806
LID - 10.1002/gps.2787 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Poststroke emotional incontinence (PSEI) has been associated with 
      serotonergic dysfunction. Polymorphisms of serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and 
      serotonin 2a receptor (5-HTR2a) genes may regulate serotonergic signaling at 
      brain synapses, and this study was to investigate associations with PSEI in an 
      East Asian population. METHODS: In 276 stroke cases, PSEI was diagnosed by Kim's 
      criteria. Covariates included age, gender, education, history of depression or 
      stroke, current depression, and stroke severity and location. Genotypes were 
      ascertained for 5-HTT gene-linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR), serotonin 
      transporter intron 2 variable number tandem repeat, 5-HTR2a 1438A/G, and 5-HTR2a 
      102 T/C. Associations with PSEI were estimated by using logistic regression 
      models, and gene-gene interactions were investigated by using the generalized 
      multifactor dimensionality reduction method. RESULTS: PSEI was present in 37 
      (13.4%) patients. The 5-HTT gene-linked promoter region s/s genotype was 
      independently associated with PSEI. No associations with STin2 VNTR and 5-HTR2a 
      genes were found, and no significant gene-gene interactions were identified. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Stroke patients with 5-HTTLPR s allele had higher susceptibility to 
      PSEI, which underlines the potential role of serotonergic pathways in its 
      etiology.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0024308 [doi]
LID - e24308
AB  - To date there are 9 known diseases caused by an expanded polyglutamine repeat, 
      with the most prevalent being Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease is a 
      progressive autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder for which currently no 
      therapy is available. It is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene, 
      which results in an expansion of a glutamine stretch at the N-terminal end of the 
      huntingtin protein. This polyglutamine expansion plays a central role in the 
      disease and results in the accumulation of cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates. 
      Here, we make use of modified 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate (CUG)n triplet-repeat 
      antisense oligonucleotides to effectively reduce mutant huntingtin transcript and 
      protein levels in patient-derived Huntington's disease fibroblasts and 
      lymphoblasts. The most effective antisense oligonucleotide, (CUG)(7), also 
      reduced mutant ataxin-1 and ataxin-3 mRNA levels in spinocerebellar ataxia 1 and 
      3, respectively, and atrophin-1 in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy patient 
      derived fibroblasts. This antisense oligonucleotide is not only a promising 
      therapeutic tool to reduce mutant huntingtin levels in Huntington's disease but 
      our results in spinocerebellar ataxia and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      cells suggest that this could also be applicable to other polyglutamine expansion 
      disorders as well.

TI  - Quantification of age-dependent somatic CAG repeat instability in Hdh CAG 
      knock-in mice reveals different expansion dynamics in striatum and liver.
PG  - e23647
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0023647 [doi]
LID - e23647
AB  - BACKGROUND: Age at onset of Huntington's disease (HD) is largely determined by 
      the CAG trinucleotide repeat length in the HTT gene. Importantly, the CAG repeat 
      undergoes tissue-specific somatic instability, prevalent in brain regions that 
      are disease targets, suggesting a potential role for somatic CAG repeat 
      instability in modifying HD pathogenesis. Thus, understanding underlying 
      mechanisms of somatic CAG repeat instability may lead to discoveries of novel 
      therapeutics for HD. Investigation of the dynamics of the CAG repeat size changes 
      over time may provide insights into the mechanisms underlying CAG repeat 
      instability. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To understand how the HTT CAG repeat 
      length changes over time, we quantified somatic instability of the CAG repeat in 
      Huntington's disease CAG knock-in mice from 2-16 months of age in liver, 
      striatum, spleen and tail. The HTT CAG repeat in spleen and tail was very stable, 
      but that in liver and striatum expanded over time at an average rate of one CAG 
      per month. Interestingly, the patterns of repeat instability were different 
      between liver and striatum. Unstable CAG repeats in liver repeatedly gained 
      similar sizes of additional CAG repeats (approximately two CAGs per month), 
      maintaining a distinct population of unstable repeats. In contrast, unstable CAG 
      repeats in striatum gained additional repeats with different sizes resulting in 
      broadly distributed unstable CAG repeats. Expanded CAG repeats in the liver were 
      highly enriched in polyploid hepatocytes, suggesting that the pattern of liver 
      instability may reflect the restriction of the unstable repeats to a unique cell 
      type. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results are consistent with repeat expansion 
      occurring as a consequence of recurrent small repeat insertions that differ in 
      different tissues. Investigation of the specific mechanisms that underlie liver 
      and striatal instability will contribute to our understanding of the relationship 
      between instability and disease and the means to intervene in this process.

TI  - Runx2 contributes to murine Col10a1 gene regulation through direct interaction 
      with its cis-enhancer.
PG  - 2899-910
LID - 10.1002/jbmr.504 [doi]
AB  - We have recently shown that a 150-bp Col10a1 distal promoter (-4296 to -4147 bp) 
      is sufficient to direct hypertrophic chondrocyte-specific reporter (LacZ) 
      expression in vivo. More recently, through detailed sequence analysis we 
      identified two putative tandem-repeat Runx2 binding sites within the 3'-end of 
      this 150-bp region (TGTGGG-TGTGGC, -4187 to -4176 bp). Candidate electrophoretic 
      mobility shift assay (EMSA), chromatin immunoprecipitation, and transfection 
      studies demonstrate that these putative Runx2 sites bind Runx2 and mediate 
      upregulated Col10a1/reporter activity in vitro. Transgenic studies using the 
      5'-sequence without Runx2 sites were not able to drive the cell-specific LacZ 
      reporter activity, suggesting the in vivo requirement of the Runx2 sites located 
      in the 3'-end in mediating Col10a1/reporter expression. Indeed, mutating the 
      Runx2 sites in the context of the 150-bp promoter abolishes its capacity to drive 
      hypertrophic chondrocyte-specific reporter expression in transgenic mice. We have 
      also generated multiple transgenic mouse lines using only the 3'-sequence 
      containing the Runx2 sites to drive the LacZ gene. Interestingly, no hypertrophic 
      chondrocyte-specific blue staining was observed in these transgenic mice. 
      Together, our data support that Runx2 directly interacts with murine Col10a1 
      cis-enhancer. This interaction is required but not sufficient for cell-specific 
      Col10a1 promoter activity in vivo. Additional cooperative/repressive elements 
      within the 5'- or 3'-sequences of this 150-bp promoter are needed to work with 
      Runx2 together to mediate cell-specific Col10a1 expression. Further delineation 
      of these elements/factors has the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets 
      for multiple skeletal disorders, including osteoarthritis, that show abnormal 
      Col10a1 expression and altered chondrocyte maturation.

TI  - Induction of autophagy with catalytic mTOR inhibitors reduces huntingtin 
      aggregates in a neuronal cell model.
PG  - 398-407
LID - 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2011.07435.x [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. This expansion produces a 
      mutant form of the huntingtin protein, which contains an elongated polyglutamine 
      stretch at its amino-terminus. Mutant huntingtin may adopt an aberrant, 
      aggregation-prone conformation predicted to start the pathogenic process leading 
      to neuronal dysfunction and cell death. Thus, strategies reducing mutant 
      huntingtin may lead to disease-modifying therapies. We investigated the 
      mechanisms and molecular targets regulating huntingtin degradation in a neuronal 
      cell model. We first found that mutant and wild-type huntingtin displayed 
      strikingly diverse turn-over kinetics and sensitivity to proteasome inhibition. 
      Then, we show that autophagy induction led to accelerate degradation of mutant 
      huntingtin aggregates. In our neuronal cell model, allosteric inhibition of 
      mTORC1 by everolimus, a rapamycin analogue, did not induce autophagy or affect 
      aggregate degradation. In contrast, this occurred in the presence of catalytic 
      inhibitors of both mTOR complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2. Our data demonstrate the 
      existence of an mTOR-dependent but everolimus-independent mechanism regulating 
      autophagy and huntingtin-aggregate degradation in cells of neuronal origin.

TI  - Discrepancies in reporting the CAG repeat lengths for Huntington's disease.
PG  - 20-6
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2011.136 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease results from a CAG repeat expansion within the Huntingtin 
      gene; this is measured routinely in diagnostic laboratories. The European 
      Huntington's Disease Network REGISTRY project centrally measures CAG repeat 
      lengths on fresh samples; these were compared with the original results from 121 
      laboratories across 15 countries. We report on 1326 duplicate results; a 
      discrepancy in reporting the upper allele occurred in 51% of cases, this reduced 
      to 13.3% and 9.7% when we applied acceptable measurement errors proposed by the 
      American College of Medical Genetics and the Draft European Best Practice 
      Guidelines, respectively. Duplicate results were available for 1250 lower 
      alleles; discrepancies occurred in 40% of cases. Clinically significant 
      discrepancies occurred in 4.0% of cases with a potential unexplained misdiagnosis 
      rate of 0.3%. There was considerable variation in the discrepancy rate among 10 
      of the countries participating in this study. Out of 1326 samples, 348 were 
      re-analysed by an accredited diagnostic laboratory, based in Germany, with 
      concordance rates of 93% and 94% for the upper and lower alleles, respectively. 
      This became 100% if the acceptable measurement errors were applied. The central 
      laboratory correctly reported allele sizes for six standard reference samples, 
      blind to the known result. Our study differs from external quality assessment 
      (EQA) schemes in that these are duplicate results obtained from a large sample of 
      patients across the whole diagnostic range. We strongly recommend that 
      laboratories state an error rate for their measurement on the report, participate 
      in EQA schemes and use reference materials regularly to adjust their own internal 
      standards.

TI  - A natural antisense transcript at the Huntington's disease repeat locus regulates 
      HTT expression.
PG  - 3467-77
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddr263 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of huntingtin (HTT). Relatively little attention 
      has been directed to the genomic features of the antisense strand at the HD 
      locus, though the presence of a transcript from this strand has been suggested by 
      a survey of the entire transcriptome and the existence of several EST tags. In 
      this study, we identified huntingtin antisense (HTTAS), a natural antisense 
      transcript at the HD repeat locus that contain the repeat tract. HTTAS is 5' 
      capped, poly (A) tailed and contains three exons, alternatively spliced into 
      HTTAS_v1 (exons 1 and 3) and HTTAS_v2 (exons 2 and 3). Exon 1 includes the 
      repeat. HTTAS_v1 has a weak promoter, and is expressed at low levels in multiple 
      tissue types and throughout the brain. Reporter assays indicate that while 
      efficient promoter activity requires a short repeat, repeat expansion reduces 
      promoter efficiency. Consistent with the reporter assays, levels of HTTAS_v1 are 
      reduced in human HD frontal cortex. In cell systems, overexpression of HTTAS_v1 
      specifically reduces endogenous HTT transcript levels, while siRNA knockdown of 
      HTTAS_v1 increases HTT transcript levels. Minigene constructs of the HD locus 
      confirm the regulatory effect of HTTAS_v1 on HTT, and demonstrate that the effect 
      is dependent on repeat length and is at least partially Dicer dependent. 
      Together, these findings provide strong evidence for the existence of a gene 
      antisense to HTT, with properties that include regulation of HTT expression.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual 
      disability and is caused by a CGG repeat expansion at Xq27.3 on the FMR1 gene. 
      The majority of young boys with FXS display poor attention and hyperactivity that 
      is disproportionate to their cognitive disability, and approximately 70% meet 
      diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. 
      Psychopharmacology is employed with 82% of young males 5-17 years of age, with 
      stimulant medication as the most common medication prescribed. This study 
      evaluated the effects of stimulant medication on the academic performance, 
      attention, motor activity, and psychophysiological arousal of boys with FXS, as 
      well as the concordance of effects within individuals. Participants in this study 
      included 12 boys with FXS who were treated with stimulants. Participants 
      completed videotaped academic testing on two consecutive days and were randomly 
      assigned to be off stimulants for 1 day and on stimulants the other day. On each 
      day, multiple measures including academic performance, behavior regulation, and 
      psychophysiological arousal were collected. Approximately 75% of participants 
      performed better on attention and academic measures, and 70% showed improved 
      physiological regulation while on stimulant medication. A high degree of 
      concordance among measures was found. Lower intelligence quotient (IQ), but not 
      age, correlated with greater improvements in in-seat behavior. IQ and age did not 
      relate to on-task behaviors. The frequency and magnitude of response to stimulant 
      medication in boys with FXS is higher than those reported for most children with 
      non-specific intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder.

TI  - FMR1 premutation and full mutation molecular mechanisms related to autism.
PG  - 211-24
LID - 10.1007/s11689-011-9084-5 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by an expanded CGG repeat (>200 repeats) in 
      the 5' un-translated portion of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) 
      leading to a deficiency or absence of the FMR1 protein (FMRP). FMRP is an 
      RNA-binding protein that regulates the translation of a number of other genes 
      that are important for synaptic development and plasticity. Furthermore, many of 
      these genes, when mutated, have been linked to autism in the general population, 
      which may explain the high comorbidity that exists between FXS and autism 
      spectrum disorders (ASD). Additionally, premutation repeat expansions (55 to 200 
      CGG repeats) may also give rise to ASD through a different molecular mechanism 
      that involves a direct toxic effect of FMR1 mRNA. It is believed that RNA 
      toxicity underlies much of the premutation-related involvement, including 
      developmental concerns like autism, as well as neurodegenerative issues with 
      aging such as the fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). RNA 
      toxicity can also lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is common in older 
      premutation carriers both with and without FXTAS. Many of the problems with 
      cellular dysregulation in both premutation and full mutation neurons also 
      parallel the cellular abnormalities that have been documented in idiopathic 
      autism. Research regarding dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems caused by 
      the lack of FMRP in FXS, including metabotropic glutamate receptor 1/5 (mGluR1/5) 
      pathway and GABA pathways, has led to new targeted treatments for FXS. 
      Preliminary evidence suggests that these new targeted treatments will also be 
      beneficial in non-fragile X forms of autism.

TI  - Rare intranuclear inclusions in the brains of 3 older adult males with fragile x 
      syndrome: implications for the spectrum of fragile x-associated disorders.
PG  - 462-9
LID - 10.1097/NEN.0b013e31821d3194 [doi]
AB  - The FMR1 gene is polymorphic for the length of CGG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions in the 5' untranslated region. Premutation (55-200 CGG repeats) and 
      full-mutation (>200 CGG repeats) alleles give rise to their respective disorders 
      by different pathogenic mechanisms: RNA gain-of-function toxicity leads to 
      fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome in the premutation range, and 
      transcriptional silencing and absence of fragile X mental retardation protein 
      (FMRP) lead to fragile X syndrome in the full-mutation range. However, for the 
      latter, incomplete silencing and/or size-mosaicism might result in some 
      contribution to the disease process from residual messenger RNA production. To 
      address this possibility, we examined the brains of 3 cases of fragile X syndrome 
      for the presence of intranuclear inclusions in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. We 
      identified low levels (0.1%-1.3%) of intranuclear inclusions in all 3 cases. 
      Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for FMR1 messenger 
      RNA and immunofluorescence for FMRP revealed low but detectable levels of both 
      RNA and protein in the 3 cases, consistent with the presence of small numbers of 
      inclusions. The intranuclear inclusions were only present in FMRP-immunoreactive 
      cells. The small numbers of inclusions and very low levels of both FMR1 RNA and 
      protein suggest that the clinical course in these 3 subjects would not have been 
      influenced by contributions from RNA toxicity.

TI  - Cockayne syndrome B protein antagonizes OGG1 in modulating CAG repeat length in 
      vivo.
PG  - 509-14
AB  - OGG1 and MSH2/MSH3 promote CAG repeat expansion at Huntington's disease (HD) 
      locusin vivo during removal of oxidized bases from DNA. CSB, a 
      transcription-coupled repair (TCR) protein, facilitates repair of some of the 
      same oxidative lesions. In vitro, a knock down CSB results in a reduction of 
      transcription-induced deletions at CAG repeat tract. To test the role of CSB in 
      vivo, we measured intergenerational and somatic expansion of CAG tracts in HD 
      mice lacking CSB, OGG1, or both. We provide evidence that CSB protects CAG 
      repeats from expansion by either active reduction of the tract length during 
      parent-child transmission, or by antagonizing the action of OGG1, which tends to 
      promote expansion in somatic cells. These results raise a possibility that 
      actions of transcription-coupled and base excision repair pathways lead to 
      different outcomes at CAG tracts in vivo.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Given the recent finding of an association between intermediate-length 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) expansions in ataxin 2 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (ALS), we sought to determine whether expansions in other polyQ disease genes 
      were associated with ALS. METHODS: We assessed the polyQ lengths of ataxin 1, 
      ataxin 3, ataxin 6, ataxin 7, TBP, atrophin 1, and huntingtin in several hundred 
      patients with sporadic ALS and healthy controls. RESULTS: Other than ataxin 2, we 
      did not identify a significant association with the other polyQ genes and ALS. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the effects of ataxin 2 polyQ expansions on 
      ALS risk are likely to be rooted in the biology of ataxin 2 or ataxin 2-specific 
      interactions, rather than the presence of an expanded polyQ repeat per se. These 
      findings have important consequences for understanding the role of ataxin 2 in 
      ALS pathogenesis and provide a framework for future mechanistic studies.

AB  - Huntington's disease-like-2 (HDL2) is a phenocopy of Huntington's disease caused 
      by CTG/CAG repeat expansion at the Junctophilin-3 (JPH3) locus. The mechanisms 
      underlying HDL2 pathogenesis remain unclear. Here we developed a BAC transgenic 
      mouse model of HDL2 (BAC-HDL2) that exhibits progressive motor deficits, 
      selective neurodegenerative pathology, and ubiquitin-positive nuclear inclusions 
      (NIs). Molecular analyses reveal a promoter at the transgene locus driving the 
      expression of a CAG repeat transcript (HDL2-CAG) from the strand antisense to 
      JPH3, which encodes an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) protein. Importantly, 
      BAC-HDL2 mice, but not control BAC mice, accumulate polyQ-containing NIs in a 
      pattern strikingly similar to those in the patients. Furthermore, BAC mice with 
      genetic silencing of the expanded CUG transcript still express HDL2-CAG 
      transcript and manifest polyQ pathogenesis. Finally, studies of HDL2 mice and 
      patients revealed CBP sequestration into NIs and evidence for interference of 
      CBP-mediated transcriptional activation. These results suggest overlapping 
      polyQ-mediated pathogenic mechanisms in HD and HDL2.

TI  - Parent-of-origin differences of mutant HTT CAG repeat instability in Huntington's 
      disease.
PG  - e413-8
LID - 10.1016/j.ejmg.2011.04.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HD gene (HTT). 
      The CAG domain of mutant HTT is unstable upon intergenerational transmission, 
      however, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: From the HD 
      archives of the Leiden University Medical Centre DNA samples from all 
      parent-offspring pairs involving 36 CAG repeats or more were selected. To 
      minimize procedural variability, CAG repeat lengths in both mutant and normal HTT 
      were reassessed using the same standardized protocol, which resulted in the 
      identification of 337 parent-offspring transmissions. The effects of both 
      parental (mutant and normal CAG repeat size, age and gender) and offspring 
      (gender and season of conception) characteristics on CAG repeat instability were 
      assessed. RESULTS: Paternal transmissions were often associated with CAG repeat 
      expansion, whereas maternal transmissions mainly resulted in CAG repeat 
      contraction (mean change: +1.76 vs. -0.07, p<0.001). Only in paternal 
      transmissions larger mutant CAG repeat size was associated with a greater degree 
      of CAG repeat expansion (beta=0.73; p<0.001). Conversely, only in maternal 
      transmissions larger CAG repeat size of the normal allele was associated with a 
      greater degree of CAG repeat contraction (beta=-0.07; p=0.029). Parental age, 
      offspring gender and season of conception were not related to CAG repeat 
      instability. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a slight maternal contraction bias 
      as opposed to a paternal expansion bias of the mutant HTT CAG repeat during 
      intergenerational transmission, which only in the maternal line is associated 
      with normal HTT CAG repeat size.

AB  - Huntington's Disease (HD) is caused by trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion >36 in 
      huntingtin (htt), a protein with several documented functions. The elongated 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch in the N-terminal region of htt leads to 
      dysfunctional and degenerative events in neurons and peripheral tissues. In this 
      study, by extending the analysis to several caspase activities (i.e. caspase 2, 
      3, 6, 8 and 9), we describe genotype- and time- dependent caspase activity 
      abnormalities, decreased cell viability and a large set of alterations in 
      mitochondria morphology, in cultured blood cells from HD patients. Patients 
      homozygous for CAG repeat mutations and heterozygous with high size mutations 
      causing juvenile onset (JHD) presented significantly increased caspase 2, 3, 6, 8 
      and 9 activities, decreased cell viability and pronounced morphological 
      abnormalities, compared with cells carrying low mutation size and controls. After 
      cyanide treatment, all caspases increased their activities in homozygous and 
      highly expanded heterozygous cells, caspase 8 and 9 increased also in those cells 
      carrying low-size mutations, remarking their key role as 'caspase initiators' in 
      HD. The remarkable ageing-dependent abnormalities in peripheral cells carrying 
      particularly toxic mutations (i.e. homozygotes' and JHD's blood cells) points out 
      the potential dependence of clinical HD development and progression on either 
      mutated htt dosage or missing wild type htt. Peripheral tissues (i.e. blood 
      cells) may theoretically represent an important tool for studying HD mechanisms 
      and searching for new biomarkers, according to the patients' genotype.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the 
      5'-end of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene. In addition to the canonical C-terminal 
      full-length huntingtin (htt) nuclear export signal, a cytoplasmic 
      localization-related domain (CLRD) in the N-terminus of htt has recently been 
      reported. Here, we analyzed this domain by introducing deletion and substitution 
      mutations in a truncated N-terminal htt protein and subsequently monitored htt 
      expression, aggregation and subcellular localization by immunocytochemistry and 
      Western blot analysis. We demonstrated that Htt(4-17) was the essential sequence 
      for htt cytoplasmic localization. We also found that the subcellular distribution 
      of htt was altered when Htt(1-17) was mutated to contain amino acids of different 
      charges, suggesting a structural requirement of Htt(1-17) for the cytoplasmic 
      localization of htt. Deletion of the first three amino acids did not affect its 
      association with mitochondria. We observed that defective cytoplasmic 
      localization resulted in a reduction of total htt aggregates and increased 
      nuclear aggregates, indicating that the subcellular distribution of the protein 
      might influence the aggregation process. These studies provide new insight into 
      the molecular mechanism of htt aggregation in HD.

TI  - The influence of serotonin transporter polymorphisms on cortical activity: a 
      resting EEG study.
PG  - 33
LID - 10.1186/1471-2202-12-33 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT) is a key regulator of 
      serotonergic neurotransmission and has been linked to various psychiatric 
      disorders. Among the genetic variants, polymorphisms in the 5-HTT gene-linked 
      polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and variable-number-of-tandem-repeat in the second 
      intron (5-HTTVNTR) have functional consequences. However, their genetic impact on 
      cortical oscillation remains unclear. This study examined the modulatory effects 
      of 5-HTTLPR (L-allele carriers vs. non-carriers) and 5-HTTVNTR (10-repeat allele 
      carriers vs. non-carriers) polymorphism on regional neural activity in a young 
      female population. METHODS: Blood samples and resting state eyes-closed 
      electroencephalography (EEG) signals were collected from 195 healthy women and 
      stratified into 2 sets of comparisons of 2 groups each: L-allele carriers (N=91) 
      vs. non-carriers for 5-HTTLPR and 10-repeat allele carriers (N=25) vs. 
      non-carriers for 5-HTTVNTR. The mean power of 18 electrodes across theta, alpha, 
      beta, gamma, gamma1, and gamma2 frequencies was analyzed. Between-group 
      statistics were performed by an independent t-test, and global trends of regional 
      power were quantified by non-parametric analyses. RESULTS: Among 5-HTTVNTR 
      genotypes, 10-repeat allele carriers showed significantly low regional power at 
      gamma frequencies across the brain. We noticed a consistent global trend that 
      carriers with low transcription efficiency of 5-HTT possessed low regional 
      powers, regardless of frequency bands. The non-parametric analyses confirmed this 
      observation, with P values of 3.071x10-8 and 1.459x10-12 for 5-HTTLPR and 
      5-HTTVNTR, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS: Our analyses showed that 
      genotypes with low 5-HTT activity are associated with less local neural 
      synchronization during relaxation. The implication with respect to genetic 
      vulnerability of 5-HTT across a broad range of psychiatric disorders is 
      discussed. Given the low frequency of 10-repeat allele of 5-HTTVNTR in our 
      research sample, the possibility of false positive findings should also be 
      considered.

      of the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene termed full mutation (FM). 
      These alleles are silenced through methylation of the FMR1 promoter, leading to 
      deficit of the FMR1 protein (FMRP), and neurodevelopmental changes. However, 
      occasional FM individuals have a complete lack of methylation, and those 
      typically have only minor deficit of FMRP levels compared with normal controls 
      and their intelligence may be in the normal range. FM alleles are generated 
      through expansion of the CGG repeat from the premutation (PM) range of 55-200 
      repeats, linked to the late onset Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS). This disorder has been attributed to a 'toxicity' of the FMR1 mRNA, 
      which is significantly elevated in male carriers of PM alleles and of 
      unmethylated FM alleles. This is the first report of a 65-year-old male with an 
      unmethylated FM allele and history of alcohol abuse, who developed symptoms of 
      FXTAS. We postulate that, although the elevation of FMR1 transcripts associated 
      with unmethylated FM alleles have a potential to cause FXTAS, in some cases this 
      disorder may occur through an additional effect of exposure to neurotoxicants 
      including alcohol.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by an 
      unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion. The need for biomarkers of onset and 
      progression in HD is imperative, since currently reliable outcome measures are 
      lacking. We used two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to analyze 
      the proteome profiles in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 6 pairs of HD patients and 
      controls. Prothrombin, apolipoprotein A-IV (Apo A-IV) and haptoglobin were 
      elevated in CSF of the HD patients in comparison with the controls. We used 
      western blot as a semi-quantified measurement for prothrombin and Apo A-IV, as 
      well as enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for measurement of haptoglobin, 
      in 9 HD patients and 9 controls. The albumin quotient (Qalb), a marker of 
      blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, was not different between the HD patients and 
      the controls. The ratios of CSF prothrombin/albumin (prothrombin/Alb) and Apo 
      A-IV/albumin (Apo A-IV/Alb), and haptoglobin level were significantly elevated in 
      HD. The ratio of CSF prothrombin/Alb significantly correlated with the disease 
      severity assessed by Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS). The 
      results implicate that increased CSF prothrombin, Apo A-IV, and haptoglobin may 
      be involved in pathogenesis of HD and may serve as potential biomarkers for HD.

AB  - The CAG repeat expansions that occur in translated regions of specific genes can 
      cause human genetic disorders known as polyglutamine (poly-Q)-triggered diseases. 
      Huntington's disease and spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) are examples of 
      these diseases in which underlying mutations are localized near other 
      trinucleotide repeats in the huntingtin (HTT) and androgen receptor (AR) genes, 
      respectively. Mutant proteins that contain expanded polyglutamine tracts are 
      well-known triggers of pathogenesis in poly-Q diseases, but a toxic role for 
      mutant transcripts has also been proposed. To gain insight into the structural 
      features of complex triplet repeats of HTT and AR transcripts, we determined 
      their structures in vitro and showed the contribution of neighboring repeats to 
      CAG repeat hairpin formation. We also demonstrated that the expanded transcript 
      is retained in the nucleus of human HD fibroblasts and is colocalized with the 
      MBNL1 protein. This suggests that the CAG repeats in the HTT mRNA adopt ds-like 
      RNA conformations in vivo. The intracellular structure of the CAG repeat region 
      of mutant HTT transcripts was not sufficiently stable to be protected from 
      cleavage by an siRNA targeting the repeats and the silencing efficiency was 
      higher for the mutant transcript than for its normal counterpart.

      gene and detection of novel allelic variants.
PG  - e32
LID - 10.1038/tp.2011.34 [doi]
AB  - The serotonin transporter, called SLC6A4, SERT or 5-HTT, modulates 
      neurotransmission by removal of serotonin from the synapse of serotonergic 
      neurons, facilitating serotonin reuptake into the presynaptic terminus. Selective 
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors block the action of the serotonin transporter and 
      are used to treat depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Three 
      polymorphisms in the 5-HTT gene have been implicated in treatment response and 
      neuropsychiatric disorders. A 44-bp promoter ins/del polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) 
      produces primarily long and/or short alleles due to either 14 (short) or 16 
      (long) repeats of variably conserved 20-23 bp units. Also implicated, a 17-18 bp 
      variable number tandem repeat found in intron2 (StIn2) is expressed as triallelic 
      content with 9, 10, or 12 repeats (StIn2.9, StIn2.10 or StIn2.12). Finally, a 
      single nucleotide polymorphism rs25531 located within the promoter 
      polymorphic-linked region alters the function of the long promoter allele. We 
      developed a PCR-based fragment analysis assay, which is analyzed on an ABI 
      sequencer, whereby we are able to detect all three genotypes simultaneously. 
      Using this technique, we identified novel sequences, which demonstrate promoter 
      repeat regions containing (1) a 17 repeat with rs25531 A/G polymorphism, (2) two 
      with 18-repeat units, (3) one with 20-repeat units and (4) a 24-repeat sequence. 
      The novel repeats were confirmed by direct sequencing of gel-purified amplicons.

TI  - In vivo cell-autonomous transcriptional abnormalities revealed in mice expressing 
      mutant huntingtin in striatal but not cortical neurons.
PG  - 1049-60
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddq548 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD), caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin 
      (HTT) gene, is characterized by abnormal protein aggregates and motor and 
      cognitive dysfunction. Htt protein is ubiquitously expressed, but the striatal 
      medium spiny neuron (MSN) is most susceptible to dysfunction and death. Abnormal 
      gene expression represents a core pathogenic feature of HD, but the relative 
      roles of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous effects on transcription remain 
      unclear. To determine the extent of cell-autonomous dysregulation in the striatum 
      in vivo, we examined genome-wide RNA expression in symptomatic D9-N171-98Q 
      (a.k.a. DE5) transgenic mice in which the forebrain expression of the first 171 
      amino acids of human Htt with a 98Q repeat expansion is limited to MSNs. 
      Microarray data generated from these mice were compared with those generated on 
      the identical array platform from a pan-neuronal HD mouse model, R6/2, carrying 
      two different CAG repeat lengths, and a relatively high degree of overlap of 
      changes in gene expression was revealed. We further focused on known canonical 
      pathways associated with excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial 
      dysfunction, dopamine signaling and trophic support. While genes related to 
      excitotoxicity, dopamine signaling and trophic support were altered in both DE5 
      and R6/2 mice, which may be either cell autonomous or non-cell autonomous, genes 
      related to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and the peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor are primarily affected in DE5 transgenic mice, 
      indicating cell-autonomous mechanisms. Overall, HD-induced dysregulation of the 
      striatal transcriptome can be largely attributed to intrinsic effects of mutant 
      Htt, in the absence of expression in cortical neurons.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is one of several neurodegenerative disorders caused by 
      expansion of CAG repeats in a coding gene. Somatic CAG expansion rates in HD vary 
      between organs, and the greatest instability is observed in the brain, 
      correlating with neuropathology. The fundamental mechanisms of somatic CAG repeat 
      instability are poorly understood, but locally formed secondary DNA structures 
      generated during replication and/or repair are believed to underlie triplet 
      repeat expansion. Recent studies in HD mice have demonstrated that mismatch 
      repair (MMR) and base excision repair (BER) proteins are expansion inducing 
      components in brain tissues. This study was designed to simultaneously 
      investigate the rates and modes of expansion in different tissues of HD R6/1 mice 
      in order to further understand the expansion mechanisms in vivo. We demonstrate 
      continuous small expansions in most somatic tissues (exemplified by tail), which 
      bear the signature of many short, probably single-repeat expansions and 
      contractions occurring over time. In contrast, striatum and cortex display a 
      dramatic--and apparently irreversible--periodic expansion. Expansion profiles 
      displaying this kind of periodicity in the expansion process have not previously 
      been reported. These in vivo findings imply that mechanistically distinct 
      expansion processes occur in different tissues.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of the gene Huntingtin (Htt). 
      A dramatic pathological change in HD is the massive loss of striatal neurons as 
      the disease progresses. A useful advance in HD would be the generation of a 
      human-derived HD model to use for drug screening and understanding mechanisms of 
      HD. We utilized the recently established human iPS cell line derived from HD 
      patient fibroblasts to derive neuronal precursors and human striatal neurons. To 
      achieve this goal, the differentiation of the HD-iPS cells into striatal fate 
      required several steps. First, we generated nestin+/PAX6+/SOX1+/OCT4- neural stem 
      cells (NSCs) from HD-iPS cells using the method of embryoid body formation. 
      HD-NSCs were then subjected to a differentiation condition combining morphogens 
      and neurotrophins to induce striatal lineage commitment. Striatal neuronal 
      precursors/immature neurons stained with beta-III tubulin, calbindin and GABA but 
      not DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr = 32,000) 
      were produced in this step. Finally, maturation and terminal differentiation of 
      the striatal neuronal precursors/immature neurons resulted in striatal neurons 
      expressing markers like DARPP-32. The HD-iPS cells derived striatal neurons and 
      neuronal precursors contain the same CAG expansion as the mutation in the HD 
      patient from whom the iPS cell line was established. Moreover, the HD-NSCs showed 
      enhanced caspase activity upon growth factor deprivation compared to normal NSCs 
      (from iPS or H9 NSCs). Therefore, these differentiated cells may produce a human 
      HD cell model useful in the study of HD mechanisms and drug screening.

TI  - QEEG Measures in Huntington's Disease: A Pilot Study.
PG  - RRN1192
LID - 10.1371/currents.RRN1192 [doi]
LID - RRN1192
AB  - Structural brain changes as measured with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are 
      associated with progression of Huntington's Disease (HD), a trinucleotide repeat 
      neurodegenerative disorder. Neurophysiological measures may offer additional 
      biomarkers of the onset and progression of brain disease. We used quantitative 
      electroencephalography (QEEG) power measures to assess resting state brain 
      function in 27 HD subjects and 15 healthy controls. Those QEEG features that 
      distinguished between HD subjects and healthy controls were examined in relation 
      to illness severity, using Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) 
      subscales, as well as to the number of CAG repeats in the HD cohort. HD subjects 
      showed a global increase in delta power as compared to controls, even when 
      examining unmedicated HD subjects only (n = 13), or premanifest HD subjects only 
      (n = 3). HD subjects also showed loss of the normal anterior-posterior (AP) 
      gradient of relative alpha and delta power. Relative alpha AP gradient loss was 
      associated with lower Total Functional Capacity (TFC) and greater cognitive 
      dysfunction. Relative delta AP gradient loss was associated with lower TFC, more 
      severe motor symptoms, and greater number of CAG repeats. Overall, results 
      suggest that QEEG power measures may capture perturbations of brain function that 
      are related to functional status as well as to underlying genetic repeat 
      expansion in HD. Pilot data in the three premanifest HD subjects are consistent 
      with the hypothesis that brain functional abnormalities may be detectable even in 
      premanifest gene carriers. Cross-sectional findings suggest that QEEG measures 
      may be biomarkers of HD progression; prospective studies in larger samples are 
      needed to confirm these findings and test hypotheses regarding underlying 
      mechanisms.

TI  - Huntington's and myotonic dystrophy hESCs: down-regulated trinucleotide repeat 
      instability and mismatch repair machinery expression upon differentiation.
PG  - 176-85
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddq456 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) and myotonic dystrophy (DM1) are caused by 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions. The repeats show different instability patterns 
      according to the disorder, cell type and developmental stage. Here we studied the 
      behavior of these repeats in DM1- and HD-derived human embryonic stem cells 
      (hESCs) before and after differentiation, and its relationship to the DNA 
      mismatch repair (MMR). The relatively small (CAG)44 HD expansion was stable in 
      undifferentiated and differentiated HD hESCs. In contrast, the DM1 repeat showed 
      instability from the earliest passages onwards in DM1 hESCs with (CTG)250 or 
      (CTG)1800. Upon differentiation the DM1 repeat was stabilized. MMR genes, 
      including hMSH2, hMSH3 and hMSH6 were assessed at the transcript and protein 
      levels in differentiated cells. The coincidence of differentiation-induced 
      down-regulated MMR expression with reduced instability of the long expanded 
      repeats in hESCs is consistent with a known requirement of MMR proteins for 
      repeat instability in transgenic mice. This is the first demonstration of a 
      correlation between altered repeat instability of an endogenous DM1 locus and 
      natural MMR down-regulation, in contrast to the commonly used murine knock-down 
      systems.

TI  - Neurocognitive signs in prodromal Huntington disease.
PG  - 1-14
LID - 10.1037/a0020937 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: PREDICT-HD is a large-scale international study of people with the 
      Huntington disease (HD) CAG-repeat expansion who are not yet diagnosed with HD. 
      The objective of this study was to determine the stage in the HD prodrome at 
      which cognitive differences from CAG-normal controls can be reliably detected. 
      METHOD: For each of 738 HD CAG-expanded participants, we computed estimated years 
      to clinical diagnosis and probability of diagnosis in 5 years based on age and 
      CAG-repeat expansion number (Langbehn, Brinkman, Falush, Paulsen, & Hayden, 
      2004). We then stratified the sample into groups: NEAR, estimated to be </=9 years; 
      MID, between 9 and 15 years; and FAR, >/=15 years. The control sample included 168 
      CAG-normal participants. Nineteen cognitive tasks were used to assess attention, 
      working memory, psychomotor functions, episodic memory, language, recognition of 
      facial emotion, sensory-perceptual functions, and executive functions. RESULTS: 
      Compared with the controls, the NEAR group showed significantly poorer 
      performance on nearly all of the cognitive tests and the MID group on about half 
      of the cognitive tests (p = .05, Cohen's d NEAR as large as -1.17, MID as large 
      as -0.61). One test even revealed significantly poorer performance in the FAR 
      group (Cohen's d = -0.26). Individual tasks accounted for 0.2% to 9.7% of the 
      variance in estimated proximity to diagnosis. Overall, the cognitive battery 
      accounted for 34% of the variance; in comparison, the Unified Huntington's 
      Disease Rating Scale motor score accounted for 11.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Neurocognitive 
      tests are robust clinical indicators of the disease process prior to reaching 
      criteria for motor diagnosis of HD.

AB  - Huntington disease is a neurodegenerative disorder distinguished by the triad of 
      dominant inheritance, choreoathetosis and dementia, usually with onset in the 
      fourth and fifth decades. It is caused by an unstable cytosine-adenine-guanine 
      (CAG) trinucleotide repeat expansion in the gene IT15 in locus 4p16.3. Juvenile 
      HD that constitutes about 3% to 10% of all patients is clinically different from 
      adult-onset form and characterized by a larger number of CAG repeats typically 
      exceeding 60. We report a case of a 6-year-old boy with myoclonic seizure and 140 
      CAG repeats confirmed by molecular genetic analysis.

      treatments.
PG  - 12
LID - 10.1186/2040-2392-1-12 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by an expanded CGG repeat (> 200 repeats) in 
      the 5' untranslated portion of the fragile mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1), 
      leading to deficiency or absence of the FMR1 protein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA 
      carrier protein that controls the translation of several other genes that 
      regulate synaptic development and plasticity. Autism occurs in approximately 30% 
      of FXS cases, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified 
      (PDD-NOS) occurs in an additional 30% of cases. Premutation repeat expansions (55 
      to 200 CGG repeats) may also give rise to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), 
      including both autism and PDD-NOS, through a different molecular mechanism that 
      involves a direct toxic effect of the expanded CGG repeat FMR1 mRNA. RNA toxicity 
      can also lead to aging effects including tremor, ataxia and cognitive decline, 
      termed fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), in premutation 
      carriers in late life. In studies of mice bearing premutation expansions, there 
      is evidence of early postnatal neuronal cell toxicity, presenting as reduced cell 
      longevity, decreased dendritic arborization and altered synaptic morphology. 
      There is also evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in premutation carriers. Many 
      of the problems with cellular dysregulation in both premutation and full mutation 
      neurons also parallel the cellular abnormalities that have been documented in 
      autism without fragile X mutations. Research regarding dysregulation of 
      neurotransmitter systems in FXS, including the metabotropic glutamate receptor 
      (mGluR)1/5 pathway and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)A pathways, have led to new 
      targeted treatments for FXS. Preliminary evidence suggests that these new 
      targeted treatments will also be beneficial in non-fragile X forms of autism.

LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.33626 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited form of developmental delay, 
      is typically caused by CGG-repeat expansion in FMR1. However, little attention 
      has been paid to sequence variants in FMR1. Through the use of pooled-template 
      massively parallel sequencing, we identified 130 novel FMR1 sequence variants in 
      a population of 963 developmentally delayed males without CGG-repeat expansion 
      mutations. Among these, we identified a novel missense change, p.R138Q, which 
      alters a conserved residue in the nuclear localization signal of FMRP. We have 
      also identified three promoter mutations in this population, all of which 
      significantly reduce in vitro levels of FMR1 transcription. Additionally, we 
      identified 10 noncoding variants of possible functional significance in the 
      introns and 3'-untranslated region of FMR1, including two predicted splice site 
      mutations. These findings greatly expand the catalog of known FMR1 sequence 
      variants and suggest that FMR1 sequence variants may represent an important cause 
      of developmental delay.

TI  - Association of serotonin transporter promoter (5-HTTLPR) and intron 2 (VNTR-2) 
      polymorphisms with treatment response in temporal lobe epilepsy.
PG  - 35-8
LID - 10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2010.06.008 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common epilepsy and about 30% 
      of patients have poorly controlled seizures. Neurobiology underlying 
      responsiveness to medical treatment in TLE patients is unclear and there are 
      currently no biological tests to predict course of the disease. Animal and human 
      studies repeatedly suggested serotonergic dysfunction in subjects with TLE. We 
      investigated association of serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene polymorphisms with 
      medical treatment response in patients with TLE. METHODS: We analyzed 5-HTT gene 
      linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) in promoter and variable number of tandem 
      repeats in the second intron of the 5-HTT gene (VNTR-2) in 101 consecutive 
      subjects with TLE. RESULTS: TLE patients with the combination of 
      transcriptionally more efficient genotypes, i.e. 5-HTTLPR L/L and VNTR-2 12/12, 
      had increased seizure refractoriness to antiepileptic medication therapy and 
      shorter periods of seizure freedom, than subjects with other combinations of the 
      5-HTT genotypes. There were no other clinical or demographic differences among 
      patient groups based on the 5-HTT genotypes. CONCLUSION: Combination of the 5-HTT 
      genotypes linked with higher 5-HTT gene expression was found to be associated 
      with worse response to optimal drug therapy. Further studies should determine 
      potential role of this 5-HTT genotype polymorphism in epileptogenesis.

TI  - An information-rich CGG repeat primed PCR that detects the full range of fragile 
      X expanded alleles and minimizes the need for southern blot analysis.
PG  - 589-600
LID - 10.2353/jmoldx.2010.090227 [doi]
AB  - (CGG)(n) repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene is associated with fragile X syndrome 
      and other disorders. Current methods for FMR1 molecular testing rely on Southern 
      blot analysis to detect expanded alleles too large to be PCR-amplified and to 
      identify female homozygous alleles that often confound interpretations of PCR 
      data. A novel, single-tube CGG repeat primed FMR1 PCR technology was designed 
      with two gene-specific primers that flank the triplet repeat region, as well as a 
      third primer that is complementary to the (CGG)(n) repeat. This PCR was evaluated 
      with 171 unique DNA samples, including a blinded set of 146 clinical specimens. 
      The method detected all alleles reported by Southern blot analysis, including 
      full mutations in 66 clinical samples and comprised up to 1300 CGG. Furthermore, 
      a blinded cohort of 42 female homozygous and heterozygous specimens, including 21 
      with full mutation alleles, was resolved with 100% accuracy. Last, AGG 
      interrupter sequences, which may influence the risk of (CGG)(n) expansion in the 
      children of some carriers, were each correctly identified in 14 male and female 
      clinical samples as referenced to DNA sequencing. As a result, this PCR provides 
      robust detection of expanded alleles and resolves allele zygosity, thus 
      minimizing the number of samples that require Southern blot analysis and 
      producing more comprehensive FMR1 genotyping data than other methods.

TI  - The mTOR kinase inhibitor Everolimus decreases S6 kinase phosphorylation but 
      fails to reduce mutant huntingtin levels in brain and is not neuroprotective in 
      the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease.
PG  - 26
LID - 10.1186/1750-1326-5-26 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion within the huntingtin gene. Mutant huntingtin 
      protein misfolds and accumulates within neurons where it mediates its toxic 
      effects. Promoting mutant huntingtin clearance by activating macroautophagy is 
      one approach for treating Huntington's disease (HD). In this study, we evaluated 
      the mTOR kinase inhibitor and macroautophagy promoting drug everolimus in the 
      R6/2 mouse model of HD. RESULTS: Everolimus decreased phosphorylation of the mTOR 
      target protein S6 kinase indicating brain penetration. However, everolimus did 
      not activate brain macroautophagy as measured by LC3B Western blot analysis. 
      Everolimus protected against early declines in motor performance; however, we 
      found no evidence for neuroprotection as determined by brain pathology. In muscle 
      but not brain, everolimus significantly decreased soluble mutant huntingtin 
      levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that beneficial behavioral effects of 
      everolimus in R6/2 mice result primarily from effects on muscle. Even though 
      everolimus significantly modulated its target brain S6 kinase, this did not 
      decrease mutant huntingtin levels or provide neuroprotection.

TI  - Synthesis of pathological and nonpathological human exon 1 huntingtin.
PG  - 358-63
LID - 10.1002/psc.1252 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects 
      approximately 1 in 10 000 individuals. The underlying gene mutation was 
      identified as a CAG-triplet repeat expansion in the gene huntingtin. The CAG 
      sequence codes for glutamine, and in HD, an expansion of the polyglutamine 
      (poly-Q) stretch above 35 glutamine residues results in pathogenicity. It has 
      been demonstrated in various animal models that only the expression of exon 1 
      huntingtin, a 67-amino acid-long polypeptide plus a variable poly-Q stretch, is 
      sufficient to cause full HD-like pathology. Therefore, a deeper understanding of 
      exon 1 huntingtin, its structure, aggregation mechanism and interaction with 
      other proteins is crucial for a better understanding of the disease. Here, we 
      describe the synthesis of a 109-amino acid-long exon 1 huntingtin peptide 
      including a poly-Q stretch of 42 glutamines. This microwave-assisted solid phase 
      peptide synthesis resulted in milligram amounts of peptide with high purity. We 
      also synthesized a nonpathogenic version of exon 1 huntingtin (90-amino acid long 
      including a poly-Q stretch of 23 glutamine residues) using the same strategy. In 
      circular dichroism spectroscopy, both polypeptides showed weak alpha-helical 
      properties with the longer peptide showing a higher helical degree. These model 
      peptides have great potential for further biomedical analyses, e.g. for 
      large-scale pre-screenings for aggregation inhibitors, further structural 
      analyses as well as protein-protein interaction studies.

AB  - We report the case of a 29 year old woman with a complex movement disorder 
      syndrome due to the combination of coexisting pathological triplet repeat 
      expansions of huntingtin and ATXN8 genes. The disease course was characterized by 
      mental disturbances including cognitive decline and changes in personality 
      starting at the age of 12 years, followed by twisting motions, intentional tremor 
      and gait ataxia. Later Parkinsonian symptoms of micrographia, bradykinesia, 
      muscle rigidity and mental decline became dominant. Brain MRI showed hypoplasia 
      of the nucleus caudatus and generalized atrophy; MR spectroscopy revealed a 
      decrease of all typical metabolites except for an increased level of lactate and 
      acetate. Therapeutic trials with pramipexole, ropinirole and tetrabenazine showed 
      no benefit, while levetiracetam caused agitation and hallucinations. We discuss 
      phenotype-genotype correlation and the rule of triplet repeat expansions of gene 
      ATXN8.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Presymptomatic individuals with the Huntingtin (HTT) CAG expansion 
      mutation that causes Huntington's disease may have higher levels of depressive 
      symptoms than healthy comparison populations. However, the prevalence of HTT CAG 
      repeat expansions among individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder has 
      not been established. METHOD: This was a case-control genetic association study 
      of HTT CAG allele size in two discovery cohorts of individuals with major 
      depressive disorder and comparison subjects without major depression as well as a 
      replication cohort of individuals with major depression and comparison subjects 
      without major depression. RESULTS: CAG repeat lengths of 36 or greater were 
      observed in six of 3,054 chromosomes from individuals with major depression, 
      compared with none of 4,155 chromosomes from comparison subjects. In a third 
      cohort, one expanded allele was observed among 1,202 chromosomes in the major 
      depression group, compared with none of 2,678 chromosomes in comparison subjects. 
      No clear pattern of clinical features was shared among individuals with the 
      expanded repeats. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical populations of individuals diagnosed 
      with major depression, approximately 3 in 1,000 carried expanded HTT CAG alleles.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by loss of function mutations in 
      the FMR1 gene. Trinucleotide CGG-repeat expansions, resulting in FMR1 gene 
      silencing, are the most common mutations observed at this locus. Even though the 
      repeat expansion mutation is a functional null mutation, few conventional 
      mutations have been identified at this locus, largely due to the clinical 
      laboratory focus on the repeat tract. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To more 
      thoroughly evaluate the frequency of conventional mutations in FXS-like patients, 
      we used an array-based method to sequence FMR1 in 51 unrelated males exhibiting 
      several features characteristic of FXS but with normal CGG-repeat tracts of FMR1. 
      One patient was identified with a deletion in FMR1, but none of the patients were 
      found to have other conventional mutations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data 
      suggest that missense mutations in FMR1 are not a common cause of the FXS 
      phenotype in patients who have normal-length CGG-repeat tracts. However, 
      screening for small deletions of FMR1 may be of clinically utility.

AB  - Tandem repeat expansion is responsible for the Repeat Expansion Diseases, a group 
      of human genetic disorders that includes Fragile X syndrome (FXS). FXS results 
      from expansion of a premutation (PM) allele having 55-200 CGG.CCG-repeats in the 
      5' UTR of the FMR1 gene. The mechanism of expansion is unknown. We have treated 
      FX PM mice with potassium bromate (KBrO(3)), a potent DNA oxidizing agent. We 
      then monitored the germline and somatic expansion frequency in the progeny of 
      these animals. We show here that KBrO(3) increased both the level of 8-oxoG in 
      the oocytes of treated animals and the germline expansion frequency. Our data 
      thus suggest that oxidative damage may be a factor that could affect expansion 
      risk in humans.

TI  - Methylation of novel markers of fragile X alleles is inversely correlated with 
      FMRP expression and FMR1 activation ratio.
PG  - 1618-32

AB  - The fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by silencing of the fragile X mental 
      retardation gene (FMR1) and the absence of its product, fragile X mental 
      retardation protein (FMRP), resulting from CpG island methylation associated with 
      large CGG repeat expansions (more than 200) termed full mutation (FM). We have 
      identified a number of novel epigenetic markers for FXS using matrix-assisted 
      laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), 
      naming the most informative fragile X-related epigenetic element 1 (FREE1) and 2 
      (FREE2). Methylation of both regions was correlated with that of the FMR1 CpG 
      island detected using Southern blot (FREE1 R = 0.97; P < 0.00001, n = 23 and 
      FREE2 R = 0.93; P < 0.00001, n = 23) and negatively correlated with lymphocyte 
      expression of FMRP (FREE1 R = -0.62; P = 0.01, n = 15 and FREE2 R = -0.55; P = 
      0.03, n = 15) in blood of partially methylated 'high functioning' FM males. In 
      blood of FM carrier females, methylation of both markers was inversely correlated 
      with the FMR1 activation ratio (FREE1 R = -0.93; P < 0.0001, n = 12 and FREE2 R = 
      -0.95; P < 0.0001, n = 9). In a sample set of 49 controls, 18 grey zone (GZ 40-54 
      repeats), 22 premutation (PM 55-170 repeats) and 22 (affected) FXS subjects, the 
      FREE1 methylation pattern was consistent between blood and chorionic villi as a 
      marker of methylated FM alleles and could be used to differentiate FXS males and 
      females from controls, as well as from carriers of GZ/PM alleles, but not between 
      GZ and PM alleles and controls. Considering its high-throughput and specificity 
      for pathogenic FM alleles, low cost and minimal DNA requirements, FREE MALDI-TOF 
      MS offers a unique tool in FXS diagnostics and newborn population screening.

AB  - The mental retardation, autistic features, and behavioral abnormalities 
      characteristic of the Fragile X mental retardation syndrome result from the loss 
      of function of the RNA-binding protein FMRP. The disease is usually caused by a 
      triplet repeat expansion in the 5'UTR of the FMR1 gene. This leads to loss of 
      function through transcriptional gene silencing, pointing to a key function for 
      FMRP, but precluding genetic identification of critical activities within the 
      protein. Moreover, antisense transcripts (FMR4, ASFMR1) in the same locus have 
      been reported to be silenced by the repeat expansion. Missense mutations offer 
      one means of confirming a central role for FMRP in the disease, but to date, only 
      a single such patient has been described. This patient harbors an isoleucine to 
      asparagine mutation (I304N) in the second FMRP KH-type RNA-binding domain, 
      however, this single case report was complicated because the patient harbored a 
      superimposed familial liver disease. To address these issues, we have generated a 
      new Fragile X Syndrome mouse model in which the endogenous Fmr1 gene harbors the 
      I304N mutation. These mice phenocopy the symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome in the 
      existing Fmr1-null mouse, as assessed by testicular size, behavioral phenotyping, 
      and electrophysiological assays of synaptic plasticity. I304N FMRP retains some 
      functions, but has specifically lost RNA binding and polyribosome association; 
      moreover, levels of the mutant protein are markedly reduced in the brain 
      specifically at a time when synapses are forming postnatally. These data suggest 
      that loss of FMRP function, particularly in KH2-mediated RNA binding and in 
      synaptic plasticity, play critical roles in pathogenesis of the Fragile X 
      Syndrome and establish a new model for studying the disorder.

TI  - Formation of polyglutamine inclusions in a wide range of non-CNS tissues in the

PG  - e8025
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0008025 [doi]
LID - e8025
AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited progressive 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the ubiquitously 
      expressed HD gene resulting in an abnormally long polyglutamine repeat in the 
      huntingtin protein. Polyglutamine inclusions are a hallmark of the neuropathology 
      of HD. We have previously shown that inclusion pathology is also present in the 
      peripheral tissues of the R6/2 mouse model of HD which expresses a small 
      N-terminal fragment of mutant huntingtin. To determine whether this peripheral 
      pathology is a consequence of the aberrant expression of this N-terminal 
      fragment, we extend this analysis to the genetically precise knock-in mouse model 
      of HD, HdhQ150, which expresses mutant mouse huntingtin. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: We have previously standardized the CAG repeat size and strain 
      background of the R6/2 and HdhQ150 knock-in mouse models and found that they 
      develop a comparable and widespread neuropathology. To determine whether HdhQ150 
      knock-in mice also develop peripheral inclusion pathology, homozygous 
      Hdh(Q150/Q150) mice were perfusion fixed at 22 months of age, and tissues were 
      processed for histology and immunohistochemistry with the anti-huntingtin 
      antibody S830. The peripheral inclusion pathology was almost identical to that 
      found in R6/2 mice at 12 weeks of age with minor differences in inclusion 
      abundance. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The highly comparable peripheral inclusion 
      pathology that is present in both the R6/2 and HdhQ150 knock-in models of HD 
      indicates that the presence of peripheral inclusions in R6/2 mice is not a 
      consequence of the aberrant expression of an N-terminal huntingtin protein. It 
      remains to be determined whether peripheral inclusions are a pathological feature 
      of the human disease. Both mouse models carry CAG repeats that cause childhood 
      disease in humans, and therefore, inclusion pathology may be a feature of the 
      childhood rather than the adult forms of HD. It is important to establish the 
      extent to which peripheral pathology causes the peripheral symptoms of HD from 
      the perspective of a mechanistic understanding and future treatment options.

AB  - Fragile X-associated disorders are caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      in the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. Expansion of the CGG 
      trinucleotide repeats to >200 copies (that is, a full mutation) induces 
      methylation of the FMR1 gene, with transcriptional silencing being the eventual 
      outcome. Previous data have shown that FMR1 premutation carriers (individuals 
      with 55-199 repeats) have increased FMR1 mRNA levels with decreased protein 
      (fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)) levels. However, the point at which 
      this translational inefficiency occurs, given the increased transcription 
      mechanism, has not yet been explored and remains to be elucidated. We examined 
      the repeat length group, FMR1 transcript and FMRP levels in 74 males with a wide 
      range of repeat lengths using analysis of covariance to better characterize this 
      association. Results showed that the mean FMRP level among carriers with 80-89 
      repeats was significantly higher than the mean levels among lower (54-79) and 
      higher (90-120) premutation carriers, in spite of the increasing transcript level 
      with repeat length. Taken together, these results suggest that the 80-89-repeat 
      group may lead to different properties that increase the efficiency of 
      translation compared with other premutation repeat size groups.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effect of both promoter and intron 
      polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter (5HTT) gene on posttraumatic stress 
      disorder (PTSD) development. For this purpose, two polymorphisms of the 5-HTT 
      gene, which are found in the promoter (5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region) and 
      second intron (variable number of tandem repeats) of the gene, were analyzed in 
      100 patients who were admitted to the Emergency Department after a mild physical 
      trauma. None of the 5-HTT polymorphisms studied have an effect on PTSD 
      development after a mild physical injury, but having L allele for 5-HTT 
      gene-linked polymorphic region may cause milder hyperarousal symptoms in those 
      patients who have developed PTSD.

PG  - 199-203
LID - 10.1016/j.tox.2009.10.019 [doi]
AB  - Increasing evidence supports a role for oxidative DNA damage and impaired DNA 
      repair mechanisms in the pathogenesis of age related neurodegenerative diseases. 
      Within this context there is a current interest in the understanding of the role 
      played by polymorphisms of DNA repair genes in the inter-individual risk to 
      develop neurodegenerative pathologies, as well as in the onset and the 
      progression of disease symptoms. Particularly, somatic CAG repeat expansion of 
      the gene encoding for huntingtin has been observed in tissues of patients 
      affected by Huntington's disease (HD), including blood and brain. Recent evidence 
      suggests that somatic CAG repeat expansion in HD cells might contribute to 
      disease age at onset and is mediated by the DNA repair OGG1 enzyme, during the 
      removal of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) from the DNA. There is also evidence that the 
      expression of hMTH1, which removes 8-oxoG from the nucleotide pool, protects mice 
      from HD-like symptoms, and progenitor striatal cells from the toxic effects of 
      the mutant huntingtin. The hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism results in reduced OGG1 
      activity and increased 8-oxoG formation. In the present study, performed on blood 
      DNA from 91 HD subjects, we observed that bearers of the mutant Cys326 allele 
      (Ser326Cys+Cys326Cys) tend to have an increased number of CAG repeats of the 
      expanded HD allele (P=0.049); moreover bearers of at least one copy of the mutant 
      Cys326 allele, mainly heterozygous subjects, showed a significant (P=0.041) 
      earlier disease onset than Ser326Ser wild-type individuals, suggesting a possible 
      role of the hOGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphism in HD phenotype.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant progressive, disabling 
      neurodegenerative disorder, for which there is no effective treatment. Predictive 
      testing (PT) for this illness began in 1986 and by 1993 it became more precise 
      after cloning of the gene and the discovery of a CAG repeat expansion as the 
      underlying cause. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the implementation 
      and results of a PT program in a group of at-risk Mexican individuals with 12 
      years of follow-up. Our PT program conforms to the guidelines proposed by the 
      International Huntington Association and the HD Working group of the World 
      Federation of Neurology. Seventy-five individuals requested the testing, four of 
      them did not fulfill the inclusion criteria, and five abandoned the program 
      voluntarily before receiving the test results. Therefore, 66 results were 
      delivered to 41 noncarriers and 25 mutation carriers. We did not have any 
      catastrophic event, but 4 individuals with normal results and 11 mutation 
      carriers were depressed. Even if this is a small sample, it is the first report 
      of PT in a Latin-American population in which we have been faced with the same 
      problems referred to in larger series.

TI  - Incidence of fragile X syndrome by newborn screening for methylated FMR1 DNA.
PG  - 503-14
LID - 10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.09.007 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from a CGG-repeat expansion that triggers 
      hypermethylation and silencing of the FMR1 gene. FXS is referred to as the most 
      common form of inherited intellectual disability, yet its true incidence has 
      never been measured directly by large population screening. Here, we developed an 
      inexpensive and high-throughput assay to quantitatively assess FMR1 methylation 
      in DNA isolated from the dried blood spots of 36,124 deidentified newborn males. 
      This assay displays 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity for detecting FMR1 
      methylation, successfully distinguishing normal males from males with 
      full-mutation FXS. Furthermore, the assay can detect excess FMR1 methylation in 
      82% of females with full mutations, although the methylation did not correlate 
      with intellectual disability. With amelogenin PCR used for detecting the presence 
      of a Y chromosome, this assay can also detect males with Klinefelter syndrome 
      (KS) (47, XXY). We identified 64 males with FMR1 methylation and, after 
      confirmatory testing, found seven to have full-mutation FXS and 57 to have KS. 
      Because the precise incidence of KS is known, we used our observed KS incidence 
      as a sentinel to assess ascertainment quality and showed that our KS incidence of 
      1 in 633 newborn males was not significantly different from the literature 
      incidence of 1 in 576 (p = 0.79). The seven FXS males revealed an FXS incidence 
      in males of 1 in 5161 (95% confidence interval of 1 in 10,653-1 in 2500), 
      consistent with some earlier indirect estimates. Given the trials now underway 
      for possible FXS treatments, this method could be used in newborn or infant 
      screening as a way of ensuring early interventions for FXS.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) affects older males carrying 
      premutation, that is, expansions of the CGG repeat (in the 55-200 range), in the 
      FMR1 gene. The neurological changes are linked to the excessive FMR1 messenger 
      RNA (mRNA), becoming toxic through a 'gain-of-function'. Because elevated levels 
      of this mRNA are also found in carriers of the smaller expansion (grey zone) 
      alleles, ranging from 40 to 54 CGGs, we tested for a possible role of these 
      alleles in the origin of movement disorders associated with tremor. We screened 
      228 Australian males affected with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and other 
      causes of parkinsonism recruited from Victoria and Tasmania for premutation and 
      grey zone alleles. The frequencies of either of these alleles were compared with 
      the frequencies in a population-based sample of 578 Guthrie spots from 
      consecutive Tasmanian male newborns (controls). There was a significant excess of 
      premutation carriers (Fisher's exact test p = 0.006). There was also a more than 
      twofold increase in grey zone carriers in the combined sample of the Victorian 
      and Tasmanian cases, with odds ratio (OR ) = 2.36, and 95% confidence intervals 
      (CI): 1.20-4.63, as well as in Tasmanian cases only (OR = 2.33, 95% CI: 
      1.06-5.13), compared with controls. The results suggest that the FMR1 grey zone 
      alleles, as well as premutation alleles, might contribute to the aetiology of 
      disorders associated with parkinsonism.

TI  - Normal and mutant HTT interact to affect clinical severity and progression in 
      Huntington disease.
PG  - 1280-5
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181bd1121 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HD gene (HTT). We aimed to 
      assess whether interaction between CAG repeat sizes in the mutant and normal 
      allele could affect disease severity and progression. METHODS: Using linear 
      regression and mixed-effects models, the influence of mutant and normal CAG 
      repeat sizes interaction was assessed on 1) age at onset in 921 patients with HD, 
      2) clinical severity and progression in 512 of these patients with follow-up data 
      available, and 3) basal ganglia volume on magnetic resonance images in 16 
      premanifest HD mutation carriers. RESULTS: Normal and mutant CAG repeat sizes 
      interacted to influence 1) age at onset (p = 0.001), 2) severity or progression 
      of motor, cognitive, and functional, but not behavioral, symptoms in patients 
      with HD (all p < 0.05), and 3) in premanifest subjects, basal ganglia volumes (p 
      < 0.05). In subjects with mutant CAG expansions in the low range, increasing size 
      of the normal repeat correlated with more severe symptoms and pathology, whereas 
      for those subjects with expansions in the high range, increasing size of the 
      normal repeat correlated with less severe symptoms and pathology. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Increasing CAG repeat size in normal HTT diminishes the association between 
      mutant CAG repeat size and disease severity and progression in Huntington 
      disease. The underlying mechanism may involve interaction of the polyglutamine 
      domains of normal and mutant huntingtin (fragments) and needs further 
      elucidation. These findings may have predictive value and are essential for the 
      design and interpretation of future therapeutic trials.

TI  - Effect of dopamine transporter gene (SLC6A3) variation on dorsal anterior 
      cingulate function in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 365-375
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.31022 [doi]
AB  - Although attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated both with 
      brain alterations in attention and executive function (EF) circuitry and with 
      genetic variations within the dopamine system (including the dopamine transporter 
      gene [SLC6A3]), few studies have directly investigated how genetic variations are 
      linked to brain alterations. We sought to examine how a polymorphism in the 3' 
      untranslated region (UTR) of SLC6A3, associated with ADHD in meta-analysis, might 
      contribute to variation in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) function in 
      subjects with ADHD. We collected fMRI scans of 42 individuals with ADHD, all of 
      European descent and over the age of 17, while they performed the multi-source 
      interference task (MSIT), a cognitive task shown to activate dACC. SLC6A3 3' UTR 
      variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms were genotyped and brain 
      activity was compared for groups based on allele status. ADHD individuals 
      homozygous for the 10R allele showed significant hypoactivation in the left dACC 
      compared to 9R-carriers. Exploratory analysis also showed trends toward 
      hypoactivation in the 10R homozygotes in left cerebellar vermis and right lateral 
      prefrontal cortex. Further breakdown of genotype groups showed similar activation 
      in individuals heterozygous and homozygous for the 9R allele. Alterations in 
      activation of attention and EF networks found previously to be involved in ADHD 
      are likely influenced by SLC6A3 genotype. This genotype may contribute to 
      heterogeneity of brain alterations found within ADHD samples.

TI  - Influence of serotonergic/noradrenergic gene polymorphisms on nausea and sweating 
      induced by milnacipran in the treatment of depression.
PG  - 393-8
AB  - The present study was conducted to find out the predictors of side effects such 
      as nausea and excessive sweating induced by milnacipran, a 
      serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Both clinical characteristics prior 
      to the treatment and gene polymorphisms such as serotonin transporter (5-HTT) 
      gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), a variable number of tandem repeats in 
      the second intron of the 5-HTT gene (5-HTTVNTR), 5-HT2A receptor gene (5-HT2A 
      G-1438A), a TPH gene polymorphism in intron 7 (TPH A218C), norepinephrine 
      transporter (NET) gene polymorphism in the promoter region (NET T-182C) and in 
      the exon 9 (NET G1287A), a variable number of tandem repeats in the promoter 
      region of monoamine oxidase A, were items to be assessed in this study. 
      Ninety-six patients with major depressive disorder were treated with milnacipran. 
      Side effects were assessed at 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks of treatment with Udvalg for 
      Kliniske Undersogelser side effects scale. The results showed that no gene 
      polymorphisms included in this study affected the susceptibility of nausea and 
      excessive sweating induced by milnacipran. Patients with older age are more 
      likely to develop excessive sweating than others. The major limitation of this 
      study is a small sample size. Further studies with larger populations and more 
      kinds of gene polymorphisms should be needed to see if specific gene 
      polymorphisms determine the susceptibility of side effects induced by 
      milnacipran.

TI  - Preimplantation genetic diagnosis of P450 oxidoreductase deficiency and 
      Huntington Disease using three different molecular approaches simultaneously.
PG  - 263-71
LID - 10.1007/s10815-009-9327-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Description of the confluence of different molecular techniques to 
      detect three different mutations in one cell. The man carries a 20 base pair 
      insertion in exon 12 of the POR gene (c.1551_1552ins20), and the woman carries a 
      point mutation in exon 8 of the POR gene (c.859G>C) plus a triplet repeat 
      expansion in the HTT gene. METHODS: Huntington Disease (HD) had to be diagnosed 
      using short tandem repeat (STR) markers linked to the HTT gene. The mutation 
      c.1551_1552ins20 was analyzed by fragment size and c.859G>C was minisequenced. 
      Furthermore, STR markers linked to the POR gene were included to support the 
      diagnosis of P450 oxidoreductase (POR) deficiency. RESULTS: Nine embryos were 
      diagnosed in total: three as POR deficiency affected, two as HD affected, one as 
      POR deficiency and HD affected, and two as carriers of the paternal POR 
      deficiency mutation and healthy for HD. These two last embryos were transferred 
      but no pregnancy was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: A successful procedure combining 
      direct and indirect methods for the detection of three different mutations in a 
      single cell has been achieved for the first time.

PG  - 5667-71
LID - 10.1167/iovs.09-3764 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the disease locus associated with autosomal dominant Fuchs 
      corneal dystrophy (FCD) in a large family and to compare the progression of 
      severity in families mapped to the FCD1 and FCD2 loci. METHODS: Seventeen 
      individuals in a large family were examined by slit lamp biomicroscopy. Blood 
      samples were collected, DNA was extracted, and a genome-wide scan was performed 
      with a microarray SNP chip. After initial generation of a genome-wide, two-point 
      LOD score, linkage was confirmed and the critical interval was established by 
      genotyping of short tandem repeat (STR) microsatellite markers. RESULTS: A 
      genome-wide linkage scan localized the disease interval to the long arm of 
      chromosome 5, with a maximum two-point parametric LOD score of 3.41. Haplotype 
      analyses refined the critical interval to 5q33.1-q35.2, spanning a 27-Mb (29-cM) 
      region. Clinical examination of affected individuals in this family revealed an 
      early onset of FCD at approximately age 40, after which progression of the 
      disease was significantly attenuated compared to the FCD1- and FCD2-linked 
      families. CONCLUSIONS: Late-onset FCD is linked to a novel locus on 5q33.1-q35.2 
      and is associated with a milder severity in age at onset and rate of progression 
      than the FCD1 and FCD2 loci. Correlation of individual genotypes with unique 
      rates of disease progression will provide important tools for disease management, 
      as well as for identifying the underlying genetic lesion, offer insight into the 
      pathomechanism of FCD.

TI  - Huntington's disease-like and ataxia syndromes: identification of a family with a 
      de novo SCA17/TBP mutation.
PG  - 12-5
LID - 10.1016/j.parkreldis.2009.06.006 [doi]
AB  - The autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias, commonly referred to as SCAs, are 
      clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders. 
      Twenty-eight genetic subtypes have been identified, of which 7 are caused by 
      expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat that encodes a polyglutamine tract in the 
      respective proteins. SCA17 is caused by a CAG/CAA repeat expansion in the TATA 
      box-binding protein-gene (TBP). In some cases the clinical phenotype of SCA17 
      overlaps that of Huntington's disease (HD), hence the use of the term 
      Huntington's disease-like. We screened 89 patients with a Huntington's 
      disease-like phenotype without the HD-gene mutation and 178 patients with 
      genetically unclassified cerebellar ataxia for the mutation in TBP. A 33-year old 
      woman presenting with an HD like phenotype with a de novo 54 CAG/CAA repeat 
      expansion was identified. Her normal allele included 38 repeats. The patient's 
      mother and father both carried normal range repeats, 38/38 and 33/39 
      respectively. Analysis of the repeat structures revealed that the expansion had 
      occurred upon expansion of the longer paternal allele. We conclude that, however 
      rare, SCA17 must be considered as a cause of Huntington's disease-like phenotypes 
      and ataxia syndromes, also in isolated cases.

TI  - A triplet repeat expansion genetic mouse model of infantile spasms syndrome, 
      Arx(GCG)10+7, with interneuronopathy, spasms in infancy, persistent seizures, and 
      adult cognitive and behavioral impairment.

AB  - Infantile spasms syndrome (ISS) is a catastrophic pediatric epilepsy with motor 
      spasms, persistent seizures, mental retardation, and in some cases, autism. One 
      of its monogenic causes is an insertion mutation [c.304ins (GCG)(7)] on the X 
      chromosome, expanding the first polyalanine tract of the interneuron-specific 
      transcription factor Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) from 16 to 23 alanine 
      codons. Null mutation of the Arx gene impairs GABA and cholinergic interneuronal 
      migration but results in a neonatal lethal phenotype. We developed the first 
      viable genetic mouse model of ISS that spontaneously recapitulates salient 
      phenotypic features of the human triplet repeat expansion mutation. 
      Arx((GCG)10+7) ("Arx plus 7") pups display abnormal spasm-like myoclonus and 
      other key EEG features, including multifocal spikes, electrodecremental episodes, 
      and spontaneous seizures persisting into maturity. The neurobehavioral profile of 
      Arx mutants was remarkable for lowered anxiety, impaired associative learning, 
      and abnormal social interaction. Laminar decreases of Arx+ cortical interneurons 
      and a selective reduction of calbindin-, but not parvalbumin- or 
      calretinin-expressing interneurons in neocortical layers and hippocampus indicate 
      that specific classes of synaptic inhibition are missing from the adult 
      forebrain, providing a basis for the seizures and cognitive disorder. A 
      significant reduction of calbindin-, NPY (neuropeptide Y)-expressing, and 
      cholinergic interneurons in the mutant striatum suggest that dysinhibition within 
      this network may contribute to the dyskinetic motor spasms. This mouse model 
      narrows the range of critical pathogenic elements within brain inhibitory 
      networks essential to recreate this complex neurodevelopmental syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation in the coding region of a novel gene. 
      The mechanism of HD is unknown. Most data suggest that polyglutamine-mediated 
      aggregation associated with expression of mutant huntingtin protein (mhtt) 
      contributes to the pathology. However, recent studies have identified early 
      cellular dysfunctions that preclude aggregate formation. Suppression of 
      aggregation is accepted as one of the markers of successful therapeutic 
      approaches. Previously, we demonstrated that tricyclic pyrone (TP) compounds 
      efficiently inhibited formation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates in cell and 
      mouse models representing Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In the present study, we 
      aimed to determine whether TP compounds could prevent aggregation and restore 
      early cellular defects in primary embryonic striatal neurons from animal model 
      representing HD. RESULTS: TP compounds effectively inhibit aggregation caused by 
      mhtt in neurons and glial cells. Treatment with TP compounds also alleviated 
      cholesterol accumulation and restored clathrin-independent endocytosis in HD 
      neurons. CONCLUSION: We have found that TP compounds not only blocked 
      mhtt-induced aggregation, but also alleviated early cellular dysfunctions that 
      preclude aggregate formation. Our data suggest TP molecules may be used as lead 
      compounds for prevention or treatment of multiple neurodegenerative diseases 
      including HD and AD.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the HD gene. Besides psychiatric, motor and cognitive symptoms, HD 
      patients suffer from sleep disturbances. In order to screen a rat model 
      transgenic for HD (tgHD rats) for sleep-wake cycle dysregulation, we monitored 
      their circadian activity peaks in the present study. TgHD rats of both sexes 
      showed hyperactivity during the dark cycle and more frequent light cycle activity 
      peaks indicative for a disturbed sleep-wake cycle. Focusing on males at the age 
      of 4 and 14 months, analyses of receptor levels in the hypothalamus and the basal 
      forebrain revealed that 5-HT(2A)- and adrenergic alpha(2)-receptor densities in 
      these regions were significantly altered in tgHD rats compared to their wild-type 
      littermates. Adrenergic receptor densities correlated negatively with the light 
      cycle hyperactivity peaks at later stages of the disease in male tgHD rats. 
      Furthermore, reduced leptin levels, a feature associated with circadian 
      misalignment, were present. Our study demonstrates that the male tgHD rat is a 
      suitable model to investigate HD associated sleep alterations. Further studies 
      are warranted to elucidate the role of adrenergic- and 5-HT(2A)-receptors as 
      therapeutic targets for dysregulation of the circadian activity in HD.

TI  - Human embryonic stem cell models of Huntington disease.
PG  - 106-13
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an incurable late-onset neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the HD gene (HTT). The major 
      hallmark of disease pathology is neurodegeneration in the brain. Currently, there 
      are no useful in-vitro human models of HD. Recently, two human embryonic stem 
      cell (hESC) lines carrying partial (CAG(37)) and fully (CAG(51)) penetrant mutant 
      alleles have been derived from affected IVF embryos identified following 
      preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). Fluorescence polymerase chain reaction 
      (F-PCR) and Genescan analysis confirmed the original embryonic HD genotypes. 
      Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis confirmed the expression of mutant 
      transcripts and western blot analysis demonstrated expression of mutant 
      huntingtin protein (HTT). After treatment with noggin, HD hESC formed 
      neurospheres, which could be further differentiated into cells susceptible to 
      neurodegeneration in HD, namely primary neurones and astrocytes. Small pool PCR 
      analysis of neurosphere cells revealed instability of disease-length CAG repeats 
      following differentiation. The presence of active HTT genes, neural 
      differentiation capabilities and evidence of CAG repeat instability indicates 
      these HD hESC lines may serve as valuable in-vitro human models of HD to better 
      understand the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in patients, and for drug 
      screening to identify new therapies for human clinical trials.

TI  - A survey of (CAG)n repeats causing juvenile Huntington disease in an Iranian 
      family with 4 affected members.
PG  - 273-6
AB  - Huntington's disease is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion (CAG)n in the 
      gene coding for Huntingtin (Htt) and is one of the several polyglutamine 
      diseases. Its physical symptoms occur in a large range of ages, with a mean 
      occurrence in a person's late 40's and early 50's. Almost all references 
      indicated that if the age of onset is below 20 years then it is known as juvenile 
      HD. Our case was an Iranian family with 4 affected siblings (2 sisters and 2 
      brothers). In addition to 4 affected children, they had 5 normal male progenies. 
      There was no any other case in their family history. The onset age of the disease 
      in our case family was 20 to 25 years. Their parents were unaffected and 
      nonconsanguineous. Analysis of the pathogenic (CAG)n repeat region of the HD gene 
      for the affected members have showed an expansion allele with 46, 50, 46, and 44 
      repeats in 4 affected siblings. Our results indicated that the age of 20 years 
      maybe is not a stable limit point for all cases of juvenile HD, and perhaps onset 
      ages are related with the CAG repeat sizes in such individuals.

      for the trinucleotide repeat status of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene.
PG  - 5533-40
LID - 10.1021/ac9008918 [doi]
AB  - CGG repeat expansions in the 5' noncoding region of the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 gene (FMR1) give rise to both neurodevelopmental and 
      neurodegenerative human diseases depending on the length of the expansion. 
      Expansions beyond 200 repeats (full mutation) generally result in gene silencing 
      and fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading heritable form of cognitive impairment 
      and autism. Smaller expansions (55-200 CGG repeats; "premutation") give rise to 
      the neurodegenerative disorder fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS) through an entirely distinct, toxic mRNA gain-of-function mechanism. A 
      rapid means for both high-risk and newborn screening for allele size would 
      provide a greater opportunity for early intervention and family counseling as 
      well as furnish critical data on repeat size distribution and expanded allele 
      frequencies. In the current work, we propose a novel mass spectrometry (MS) based 
      method for the rapid identification of expanded CGG repeats to complement a 
      recently described polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for large population 
      screening. In this combined approach, the optimized PCR method is used to amplify 
      the relevant region of FMR1, followed by extensive nonspecific nuclease 
      digestion. The resulting oligonucleotides are analyzed by MS in a manner that 
      provides the relative proportion of triplet repeat oligonucleotides in seconds 
      per sample. This assay enables swift and reproducible detection of expanded CGG

      studies and newborn screening. Moreover, this analytical scheme establishes a 
      unique new intersection of MS with molecular biology, with potential for 
      significant interdisciplinary impact.

TI  - Genetic knock-down of HDAC7 does not ameliorate disease pathogenesis in the R6/2 
      mouse model of Huntington's disease.
PG  - e5747

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited, progressive neurological disorder 
      caused by a CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion, for which there is no effective 
      disease modifying therapy. In recent years, transcriptional dysregulation has 
      emerged as a pathogenic process that appears early in disease progression. 
      Administration of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors such as suberoylanilide 
      hydroxamic acid (SAHA) have consistently shown therapeutic potential in models of 
      HD, at least partly through increasing the association of acetylated histones 
      with down-regulated genes and by correcting mRNA abnormalities. The HDAC enzyme 
      through which SAHA mediates its beneficial effects in the R6/2 mouse model of HD 
      is not known. Therefore, we have embarked on a series of genetic studies to 
      uncover the HDAC target that is relevant to therapeutic development for HD. HDAC7 
      is of interest in this context because SAHA has been shown to decrease HDAC7 
      expression in cell culture systems in addition to inhibiting enzyme activity. 
      After confirming that expression levels of Hdac7 are decreased in the brains of 
      wild type and R6/2 mice after SAHA administration, we performed a genetic cross 
      to determine whether genetic reduction of Hdac7 would alleviate phenotypes in the 
      R6/2 mice. We found no improvement in a number of physiological or behavioral 
      phenotypes. Similarly, the dysregulated expression levels of a number of genes of 
      interest were not improved suggesting that reduction in Hdac7 does not alleviate 
      the R6/2 HD-related transcriptional dysregulation. Therefore, we conclude that 
      the beneficial effects of HDAC inhibitors are not predominantly mediated through 
      the inhibition of HDAC7.

AB  - Non-coding (CGG-repeat) expansions in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) 
      gene result in a spectrum of disorders involving altered neurodevelopment 
      (fragile X syndrome), neurodegeneration (late-onset fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome), or primary ovarian insufficiency. While reliable and 
      quantitative assays for the number of CGG repeats and FMR1 mRNA levels are now 
      available, there has been no scalable, quantitative assay for the FMR1 protein 
      (FMRP) in non-transformed cells. Using a combination of avian and murine 
      antibodies to FMRP, we developed a sensitive and highly specific sandwich 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for FMRP in peripheral blood 
      lymphocytes. This ELISA method is capable of quantifying FMRP levels throughout 
      the biologically relevant range of protein concentrations and is specific for the 
      intact FMRP protein. Moreover, the ELISA is well-suited for replicate protein 
      determinations across serial dilutions in non-transformed cells and is readily 
      scalable for large sample numbers. The FMRP ELISA is potentially a powerful tool 
      in expanding our understanding of the relationship between FMRP levels and the 
      various FMR1-associated clinical phenotypes.

TI  - Unstable familial transmissions of Huntington disease alleles with 27-35 CAG 
      repeats (intermediate alleles).
PG  - 314-20
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.30970 [doi]
AB  - There are inconsistent reports regarding the likelihood of repeat instability for 
      alleles with 27-35 CAG repeats in the Huntington disease (HD) gene. We have 
      examined the intergenerational stability of such intermediate alleles in 51 
      families from the University of British Columbia's DNA and Tissue Bank for 
      Huntington Disease Research (UBC-HD Databank). A total of 181 transmissions were 
      identified, with 30% (n = 54/181) of the alleles being unstable upon 
      transmission. The unstable transmissions included both expansions (n = 37) and 
      contractions (n = 17) of CAG size. Of the expanded alleles, 68% (n = 25/37) 
      expanded into the HD range (>36 CAG). Therefore, 14% (n = 25/181) of the 27-35 
      CAG allele transmissions examined expanded into the disease-associated range 
      resulting in a new mutation for HD. Significantly, of these new mutations, 40% (n 
      = 10/25) originated from an allele with 35 CAG repeats with CAG repeat expansions 
      ranging from +1 CAG to +23 CAG. The proportion of new mutations in the UBC-HD 
      Databank is consistent with the most recent new mutation rate for HD, estimated 
      to be at least 10%. The observed difference in the stability of HD intermediate 
      allele transmissions in this data set and in other studies may be a reflection of 
      a small sample size. Alternately, these inconsistencies may indicate an 
      underlying difference in genetic factors which influence repeat instability 
      between the different populations examined. Additional studies determining the 
      frequency and magnitude of repeat instability in this CAG repeat range and 
      factors that influence instability are urgently needed. Until we understand the 
      clinical implications of HD alleles with 27-35 CAG repeats and establish reliable 
      risks of instability, we should exercise caution when translating these results 
      to the clinic.

      microdeletion syndrome.
PG  - 1924-36
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddp114 [doi]
AB  - We characterized at the molecular level the genomic rearrangements in 28 
      unrelated patients with 9q34.3 subtelomeric deletions. Four distinct categories 
      were delineated: terminal deletions, interstitial deletions, derivative 
      chromosomes and complex rearrangements; each results in haploinsufficiency of the 
      EHMT1 gene and a characteristic phenotype. Interestingly, 25% of our patients had 
      de novo interstitial deletions, 25% were found with derivative chromosomes and 
      complex rearrangements and only 50% were bona fide terminal deletions. In 
      contrast to genomic disorders that are often associated with recurrent 
      rearrangements, breakpoints involving the 9q34.3 subtelomere region are highly 
      variable. Molecular studies identified three regions of breakpoint grouping. 
      Interspersed repetitive elements such as Alu, LINE, long-terminal repeats and 
      simple tandem repeats are frequently observed at the breakpoints. Such repetitive 
      elements may play an important role by providing substrates with a specific DNA 
      secondary structure that stabilizes broken chromosomes or assist in either DNA 
      double-strand break repair or repair of single double-strand DNA ends generated 
      by collapsed forks. Sequence analyses of the breakpoint junctions suggest that 
      subtelomeric deletions can be stabilized by both homologous and nonhomologous 
      recombination mechanisms, through a telomere-capture event, by de novo telomere 
      synthesis, or multistep breakage-fusion-bridge cycles.

TI  - Screening for the presence of FMR1 premutation alleles in women with 
      parkinsonism.
PG  - 244-9
LID - 10.1001/archneurol.2008.548 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a progressive, 
      late-onset neurodegenerative disease that affects older carriers of premutation 
      (CGG) repeat expansions of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. 
      Clinical features include intention tremor, gait ataxia, memory loss, peripheral 
      neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, and parkinsonism. The presence of parkinsonism 
      in FXTAS raises the possibility that some individuals who have Parkinson disease 
      are actually carriers of a premutation FMR1 allele. OBJECTIVE: To screen DNA 
      samples from a large cohort of females with Parkinson disease for an excess of 
      expanded alleles of the FMR1 gene. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: We screened a cohort of 
      595 women with parkinsonism, the largest screening of a parkinsonism-associated 
      group to date, for the presence of an FMR1 premutation allele (55-200 CGG 
      repeats). The screening protocol uses an enhanced polymerase chain reaction 
      method capable of flagging any FMR1 expanded CGG repeat in women as well as in 
      men. SETTING: Diagnostic assessments were performed at an outpatient tertiary 
      clinic (Parkinson Institute, Milan). Genotyping was conducted at the University 
      of California, Davis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CGG repeat number and 
      clinical/neuroimaging assessments of patients with Parkinson disease were 
      conducted. Two premutation carriers were identified. RESULTS: Two individuals 
      possessed an FMR1 allele in the premutation range (CGG repeats: 30 and 75; 30 and 
      115). This carrier frequency (2 of 595 [0.34%]) is not significantly different 
      from estimates of the allele frequency among women in the general population 
      (0.4%-0.8%). Clinical and radiologic features of these 2 patients were similar to 
      those of the general Parkinson disease population; however, 1 patient (115 CGG 
      repeats) had a family history of 2 sons with the fragile X syndrome. CONCLUSION: 
      Screening of women within the parkinsonism clinical spectrum is unlikely to be 
      productive in the absence of additional medical or family history suggestive of 
      involvement of the FMR1 gene.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative condition 
      caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion that is translated into an 
      abnormally long polyglutamine tract in the protein huntingtin. Genetic and 
      transgenic studies suggest that the mutation causes disease predominantly via 
      gain-of-function mechanisms. However, loss of normal huntingtin function 
      resulting from the polyglutamine expansion might also contribute to the 
      pathogenesis of HD. Here, we have studied the effects of huntingtin knockdown in 
      zebrafish using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides, as its huntingtin 
      orthologue has 70% amino acid identity with the human protein. Reduced huntingtin 
      levels did not impact on gastrulation and early development, but caused massive 
      apoptosis of neuronal cells by 24 hpf. This was accompanied by impaired neuronal 
      development, resulting in small eyes and heads and enlargement of brain 
      ventricles. Older huntingtin knockdown fish developed lower jaw abnormalities 
      with most branchial arches missing. Molecular analysis revealed that BDNF 
      expression was reduced by approximately 50%. Reduction of BDNF levels by 
      injection of a BDNF morpholino resulted in phenotypes very similar to those seen 
      in huntingtin knockdown zebrafish. The phenotypes of both huntingtin- and 
      BDNF-knockdown zebrafish showed significant rescue when treated with exogenous 
      BDNF protein. This underscores the physiological importance of huntingtin as a 
      regulator of BDNF production and suggests that loss of BDNF is a major cause of 
      the developmental abnormalities seen with huntingtin knockdown in zebrafish. 
      Increasing BDNF expression may represent a useful strategy for Huntington's 
      disease treatment.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is one of the most common autosomal dominant inherited, 
      neurodegenerative disorders. It is characterized by progressive motor, emotional 
      and cognitive dysfunction. In addition metabolic abnormalities such as wasting 
      and altered energy expenditure are increasingly recognized as clinical hallmarks 
      of the disease. HD is caused by an unstable CAG repeat expansion in the HD gene 
      (HTT), localized on chromosome 4p16.3. The number of CAG repeats in the HD gene 
      is the main predictor of disease-onset, but the remaining variation is strongly 
      heritable. Transcriptional dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and enhanced 
      oxidative stress have been implicated in the pathogenesis. Recent studies suggest 
      that PGC-1alpha, a transcriptional master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis 
      and metabolism, is defective in HD. A genome wide search for modifier genes of HD 
      age-of-onset had suggested linkage at chromosomal region 4p16-4p15, near the 
      locus of PPARGC1A, the gene coding for PGC-1alpha. We now present data of 2-loci 
      PPARGC1A block 2 haplotypes, showing an effect upon age-at-onset in 447 unrelated 
      HD patients after statistical consideration of CAG repeat lengths in both HTT 
      alleles. Block 1 haplotypes were not associated with the age-at-onset. 
      Homozygosity for the 'protective' block 2 haplotype was associated with a 
      significant delay in disease onset. To our knowledge this is the first study to 
      show clinically relevant effects of the PGC-1alpha system on the course of 
      Huntington's disease in humans.

TI  - Paradoxical delay in the onset of disease caused by super-long CAG repeat 
      expansions in R6/2 mice.
PG  - 331-41
LID - 10.1016/j.nbd.2008.11.015 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the HD gene. The 
      pathological threshold for expansion in HD is around 36 CAG repeats, although 
      'super-long' expansions are found in brains of HD patients. We examined the 
      effect of varying the CAG repeat length (from 170 to 450) on behavior and 
      neuropathology of R6/2 mice. Unexpectedly, we found that increasing the repeat 
      length delayed onset of disease and prolonged survival, from around 4 months to 
      over 18 months in mice with the longest repeats. The delay in onset correlated 
      with a delayed appearance of neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs). However, 
      super-long CAG repeats are not neuroprotective. Mice carrying 2 copies of the 
      mutant transgene die earlier than those carrying a single copy. Furthermore, 
      neurodegeneration is present in super-long repeat length mice at mid-stage 
      disease, whereas little neurodegeneration is seen in mice with shorter CAG 
      repeats until end stage. Expanding the CAG repeat beyond the range where NII 
      formation is the dominant pathology has unmasked a slowly progressing 
      neurological phenotype in R6/2 mice with brain pathology, including the 
      identification of a novel form of inclusion, that more closely resembles that 
      seen in adult onset cases of HD. This mouse may represent a better model for 
      adult-onset HD than R6/2 mice with shorter repeats.

AB  - The 5' untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation gene, FMR1, 
      contains a polymorphic CGG repeat. Expansions of this repeat are associated with 
      a spectrum of disorders. Full mutation alleles, repeats >or= 200, are associated 
      with fragile X syndrome. Premutation alleles, repeats of approximately 55-199, 
      are associated with a tremor-ataxia syndrome most commonly in older males and 
      primary ovarian insufficiency in females. However, the neuropsychological impact 
      of carrying a premutation allele is presently unclear in younger adults. In this 
      study, we analyzed neuropsychological scores for 138 males and 506 females 
      ascertained from the general population and from families with a history of 
      fragile X syndrome. Subjects were age 18-50 years and had varying repeat lengths. 
      Neuropsychological scores were obtained from measures of general intelligence, 
      memory, and executive functioning, including attention. Principal component 
      analysis followed by varimax rotation was used to create independent factors for 
      analysis. These factors were modeled for males and females separately via a 
      general linear model that accounted for correlation among related subjects. All 
      models were adjusted for potential confounders, including age at testing, 
      ethnicity, and household income. Among males, no repeat length associations were 
      detected for any factor. Among females, only a significant association with 
      repeat length and self-report attention (p < 0.01) was detected, with premutation 
      carriers self-reporting significantly more attention-related problems compared to 
      noncarriers. No significant interactions between repeat length and age were 
      detected. Overall, these results indicate the lack of a global neuropsychological 
      impact of carrying a premutation allele among adults under the age of 50.

TI  - Investigation of the DCDC2 intron 2 deletion/compound short tandem repeat 
      polymorphism in a large German dyslexia sample.
PG  - 310-2
LID - 10.1097/YPG.0b013e3283063a78 [doi]
AB  - Dyslexia is a complex disorder manifested by difficulties in learning to read and 
      spell despite conventional instruction, adequate intelligence and sociocultural 
      opportunity. It is among the most common neurodevelopmental disorders with a 
      prevalence of 5-12%. The dyslexia susceptibility locus 2 on chromosome 6p21-p22 
      is one of the best-replicated linkage regions in dyslexia. On the basis of 
      systematic linkage disequilibrium studies, the doublecortin domain containing 
      protein 2 gene (DCDC2) was identified as a strong candidate gene in this region. 
      Data from a US study have suggested a complex deletion/compound short tandem 
      repeat (STR) polymorphism in intron 2 of DCDC2 as the causative mutation. In this 
      study, we analyzed this polymorphism in 396 German dyslexia trios which included 
      376 trios previously providing strong support for the DCDC2 locus. We observed no 
      significant deviation from random transmission, neither for the deletion nor for 
      the alleles of the compound STR. We also did not find the deletion or any of the 
      STR alleles to be in linkage disequilibrium with the 2-marker haplotype, which 
      was associated with dyslexia in our sample. We thus conclude that the causative 
      variant/s in DCDC2 conferring susceptibility to dyslexia in our sample remain/s 
      to be identified.

TI  - Association study of serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms with obstructive 
      sleep apnea syndrome in Chinese Han population.
PG  - 1535-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the serotonin (5-HT) is associated with circadian rhythm and 
      breathing regulation, the serotonin transporter (5-HTT), which plays an important 
      role in serotoninergic transmission, might be a strong candidate gene in the 
      pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). OBJECTIVE: To 
      investigate the association of 5-HTT gene polymorphisms with OSAS and clinical 
      characteristics. METHODS: We genotyped the 5-HTT gene linked polymorphic region 
      (5-HTTLPR) and a variable number of tandem repeats at intron 2 (STin2.VNTR) in 
      254 OSAS patients and 338 healthy controls in Chinese Han population. RESULTS: In 
      total sample, the 10-repeat allele of STin2.VNTR was significantly associated 
      with OSAS (P = 0.007, OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.15-2.58), but no association was 
      found in 5-HTTLPR. In male subjects, both polymorphisms showed significant 
      association with OSAS (Allele L: P = 0.005, OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.87; 
      Allele 10: P = 0.002, OR= 1.94, 95% CI = 1.26 to 3.00). Two haplotypes, S-12 and 
      L-10, constructed by the above polymorphisms also revealed significant 
      associations with OSAS (global P-values were 0.020 for total sample and 0.0006 
      for male subjects, respectively). Male patients carrying the haplotype S-12 
      showed a significantly lower apnea / hypopnea index (AHI), depressive factor, 
      plasma 5-HT level and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels, but higher 
      episodic memory, when compared with non-S-12 carriers (P < 0.05). However, no 
      significant differences were found in excessive daytime sleepiness or other 
      psychological function across haplotype carriers (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings support that 5-HTT gene may be involved in susceptibility to OSAS, 
      especially with sex-dependent effect.

      simplex chronicus patients with psychiatric status.
PG  - 1069-72

AB  - BACKGROUND: The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) is a key neurotransmitter 
      in the central nervous system and a responsible mediator for the itch. 
      Dysregulation of serotonergic pathways has been implicated in the pathogenesis of 
      many complex neuropsychiatric diseases. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was 
      to evaluate the relationship between lichen simplex chronicus and dysfunction and 
      serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene polymorphism. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients 
      with lichen simplex chronicus and 61 healthy control subjects were examined. 
      RESULTS: The results for the patients and control subjects were not significantly 
      different (P > 0.05) in long/long (L/L) and long/short (L/S) genotypes of 5-HTT 
      gene-linked polymorphic region (HTTLPR) polymorphism, but short/short S/S 
      genotype was lower in lichen simplex chronicus patients (17.9%) than in controls 
      (42.6%). This difference was statistically significant (P = 0.028). The results 
      for the patients and control subjects were not significantly different in 12/12, 
      10/12 and 10/10 genotypes of variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism 
      (P > 0.05). Beck depression inventory (BDI) scores and symptom 
      checklist-90-revised (SCL-90) psychotic subscale were overrepresented 
      significantly in the 12/12 genotypes than 10/12 genotypes. State and Trait 
      Anxiety Inventory tests (STAI-I and -II) point averages were not statistically 
      significant (P > 0.05) CONCLUSION: S/S genotypes of HTTLPR polymorphism in the 
      5-HTT gene may be related to lichen simplex chronicus and that patients who have 
      12/12 genotypes of VNTR polymorphism may be affected psychiatrically.

      mouse model of Huntington's disease.
PG  - 606-20
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.09.020 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      polyglutamine repeat expansion in huntingtin. A newly developed bacterial 
      artificial chromosome transgenic mouse model (BACHD) reproduces phenotypic 
      features of HD including predominantly neuropil-associated protein aggregation 
      and progressive motor dysfunction with selective neurodegenerative pathology. 
      Motor dysfunction has been shown to precede neuropathology in BACHD mice. We 
      therefore investigated the progression of synaptic pathology in pyramidal cells 
      and interneurons of the superficial motor cortex of BACHD mice. Whole-cell patch 
      clamp recordings were performed on layer 2/3 primary motor cortical pyramidal 
      cells and parvalbumin interneurons from BACHD mice at 3 months, when the mice 
      begin to demonstrate mild motor dysfunction, and at 6 months, when the motor 
      dysfunction is more severe. Changes in synaptic variances were detectable at 3 
      months, and at 6 months BACHD mice display progressive synaptic pathology in the 
      form of reduced cortical excitation and loss of inhibition onto pyramidal cells. 
      These results suggest that progressive alterations of the superficial cortical 
      circuitry may contribute to the decline of motor function in BACHD mice. The 
      synaptic pathology occurs prior to neuronal degeneration and may therefore prove 
      useful as a target for future therapeutic design.

TI  - Mutant huntingtin activates Nrf2-responsive genes and impairs dopamine synthesis 
      in a PC12 model of Huntington's disease.
PG  - 84
LID - 10.1186/1471-2199-9-84 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease is a progressive autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HD or 
      Huntington's disease gene. Although micro array studies on patient and animal 
      tissue provide valuable information, the primary effect of mutant huntingtin will 
      inevitably be masked by secondary processes in advanced stages of the disease. 
      Thus, cell models are instrumental to study early, direct effects of mutant 
      huntingtin. mRNA changes were studied in an inducible PC12 model of Huntington's 
      disease, before and after aggregates became visible, to identify groups of genes 
      that could play a role in the early pathology of Huntington's disease. RESULTS: 
      Before aggregation, up-regulation of gene expression predominated, while after 
      aggregates became visible, down-regulation and up-regulation occurred to the same 
      extent. After aggregates became visible there was a down-regulation of dopamine 
      biosynthesis genes accompanied by down-regulation of dopamine levels in culture, 
      indicating the utility of this model to identify functionally relevant pathways. 
      Furthermore, genes of the anti-oxidant Nrf2-ARE pathway were up-regulated, 
      possibly as a protective mechanism. In parallel, we discovered alterations in 
      genes which may result in increased oxidative stress and damage. CONCLUSION: 
      Up-regulation of gene expression may be more important in HD pathology than 
      previously appreciated. In addition, given the pathogenic impact of oxidative 
      stress and neuroinflammation, the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway constitutes a new 
      attractive therapeutic target for HD.

      polymorphism and respiratory failure in children with community-acquired 
      pneumonia.
PG  - 553-9
LID - 10.1097/PCC.0b013e31818d32f1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the variable nucleotide tandem repeat 
      polymorphism in intron 2 of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene is 
      associated with lung injury in children with community-acquired pneumonia. 
      DESIGN: A prospective cohort of children diagnosed with community-acquired 
      pneumonia. SETTING: Two pediatric hospitals. PATIENTS: Eight hundred fifty 
      pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia were enrolled. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Genotyping of the variable nucleotide tandem repeat polymorphism 
      in intron 2 of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene was performed on DNA 
      isolated from whole blood. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The requirement for 
      positive pressure ventilation or the diagnosis of acute lung injury or acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome were the main outcomes of the study. Children (14 
      days-19 yrs) with community-acquired pneumonia (850) were enrolled; analysis was 
      limited to African American (515) and Caucasian (232) patients. Of the 82 
      patients requiring positive pressure ventilation, 44 were diagnosed with acute 
      lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Multivariate logistic 
      regression analyses indicated that children without a copy of the A1 allele of 
      the variable nucleotide tandem repeat polymorphism in intron 2 of the 
      interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene were more likely to need positive pressure 
      ventilation compared to those with one or two copies of this allele (odds ratio = 
      2.65, confidence interval, 1.02-6.90). In addition, the absence of the A1 allele 
      also appeared to be associated with the development of community-acquired 
      pneumonia-induced acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (odds 
      ratio = 3.1, confidence interval, 0.99-9.67). CONCLUSIONS: In children with 
      community-acquired pneumonia, absence of the A1 allele at the interleukin-1 
      receptor antagonist intron 2 polymorphic site is associated with increased risk 
      for more severe lung injury, as measured by the need for positive pressure 
      ventilation or the development of acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress 
      syndrome. Conversely, presence of the A1 allele is associated with decreased risk 
      for more severe lung injury in this patient population.

TI  - Serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms in patients with chronic tension-type 
      headache: a preliminary study.
PG  - 156-60
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study is designed to understand the 
      pathophysiology of one of the most serious health problems, chronic tension-type 
      headache (CTTH). Two polymorphic sites in serotonin transporter protein gene 
      attracted much interest. These are: the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) 
      and 5'-flanking promoter region (5-HTTLPR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: VNTR and 
      5-HTTLPR polymorphisms were investigated in 126 CTTH patients and 138 healthy 
      control subjects. The patients were being treated with amitripytyline or 
      citalopram or sertraline (SSRI). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was 
      used to investigate the polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter protein gene. 
      RESULTS: There were no statistically significant results based on the 5-HTTLPR 
      gene alleles, however, STin 2.12/12 genotype and STin 2.12 allele were seen to 
      predominate the control group. In order to investigate the combined effect of the 
      two polymorphic loci on the 5-HTT gene expression, samples were separated into 
      nine groups. Genotypes (S/S-12/10) and (L/S-12/10) displayed statistically 
      significant frequency in the CTTH group than in the control group. No significant 
      differences were noticed between the 5-HTTLPR and VNTR haplotype groups and 
      success in treatment. CONCLUSION: It is possible to make reliable comparisons and 
      hypothesis about the homozygous and/or heterozygous presence of S and STin 12/10 
      alleles which may be in interaction with CTTH. On the other hand, the presence of 
      homozygous L and STin12 alleles may play a protective role against CTTH. It is 
      also possible that heterogeneity among diseases showing the same clinical 
      research will require a lot of effort for individual identification.

TI  - Full length mutant huntingtin is required for altered Ca2+ signaling and 
      apoptosis of striatal neurons in the YAC mouse model of Huntington's disease.
PG  - 80-8
LID - 10.1016/j.nbd.2008.03.010 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a progressive loss of striatal medium 
      spiny neurons (MSN). The molecular trigger of HD is a polyglutamine expansion in 
      the Huntingtin protein (Htt). The mutant Htt protein forms insoluble nuclear 
      aggregates which have been proposed to play a key role in causing neuronal cell 
      death in HD. Other lines of investigation suggest that expression of mutant Htt 
      facilitates activity of the NR2B subtype of NMDA receptors and the type 1 
      inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP(3)R1), and that disturbed calcium 
      (Ca(2+)) signaling causes apoptosis of MSNs in HD. The YAC128 transgenic HD mouse 
      model expresses the full-length human Htt protein with 120Q CAG repeat expansion 
      and displays an age-dependent loss of striatal neurons as seen in human HD brain. 
      In contrast, the shortstop mice express an amino-terminal fragment of the mutant 
      Htt protein (exons 1 and 2) and display no behavioral abnormalities or striatal 
      neurodegeneration despite widespread formation of neuronal inclusions. Here we 
      compared Ca(2+) signals in primary MSN neuronal cultures derived from YAC128 and 
      shortstop mice to their wild-type non-transgenic littermates. Repetitive 
      application of glutamate results in supranormal Ca(2+) responses in YAC128 MSNs, 
      but not in shortstop MSNs. In addition, while currents mediated by the NR2B 
      subtype of NMDA receptors were increased in YAC128 MSNs, currents in SS MSNs were 
      found to be similar to WT. Furthermore, YAC128 MSNs were sensitized to 
      glutamate-induced apoptosis. Consistent with these findings, we found that 
      application of glutamate induced rapid loss of mitochondrial membrane potential 
      in YAC128 MSNs. In contrast, SS MSNs do not show increased cell death 
      postglutamate treatment nor accelerated loss of mitochondrial membrane potential 
      following glutamate stimulation. Glutamate-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane 
      potential in YAC128 MSNs could be prevented by inhibitors of NR2B NMDA receptors 
      and mGluR1/5 receptors. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that 
      disturbed neuronal Ca(2+) signaling plays a significant role in the degeneration 
      of MSN containing full-length mutant Htt(exp). Furthermore, the results obtained 
      with neurons from shortstop mice provide additional evidence that not all 
      fragments of mutant Htt(exp) are toxic to neurons.

TI  - Extended evaluation of serotonin transporter gene functional polymorphisms in 
      subjects with post-stroke depression.
PG  - 197-201
AB  - OBJECTIVE: As an extension of our previous observation, relating a serotonin 
      transporter gene-linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR) diallelic functional 
      polymorphism (short [S] and long [L] alleles) to the risk of post-stroke major 
      depression (PSD), this study investigated the role of 2 other functional 
      polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT) in the same sample of 
      subjects with PSD. METHOD: In a clinical sample of 26 patients with PSD and 25 
      unrelated nondepressed stroke patients of Caucasian descent, we examined the 
      frequencies of a functional single nucleotide variant (A/G) within the promoter 
      region (rs25531) and located in L (16-repeat) and S (14-repeat) alleles of 
      5-HTTLPR, and a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in intron 2. 
      RESULTS: There were significant intergroup differences in the allelic frequencies 
      of 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 (SA, LA, and LG) (P < 0.05) and in the combined frequencies 
      of lower-expressing alleles (SA and LG) and higher-expressing alleles (LA) (P < 
      0.025) between subjects with PSD and nondepressed stroke. However, the 
      differences in the combined frequencies of lower-expressing (SA/SA, SA/LG, and 
      LG/LG), intermediate-expressing (SA/LA and LA/LG), and higher-expressing (LA/LA) 
      genotypes of 5-HTTLPR were not significant. Further, no significant intergroup 
      differences were found in the allelic and genotypic frequencies of the intron 2 
      VNTR. CONCLUSIONS: These findings strengthen the support for an association 
      between PSD and lower-expressing alleles of 5-HTTLPR.

TI  - ADHD and Disruptive Behavior scores - associations with MAO-A and 5-HTT genes and 
      with platelet MAO-B activity in adolescents.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.1186/1471-244X-8-28 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacological and genetic studies suggest the importance of the 
      dopaminergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic systems in the pathogenesis of 
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Disruptive Behavior Disorder 
      (DBD). We have, in a population-based sample, studied associations between 
      dimensions of the ADHD/DBD phenotype and Monoamine Oxidase B (MAO-B) activity in 
      platelets and polymorphisms in two serotonergic genes: the Monoamine Oxidase A 
      Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (MAO-A VNTR) and the 5-Hydroxytryptamine 
      Transporter gene-Linked Polymorphic Region (5-HTT LPR). METHODS: A 
      population-based sample of twins, with an average age of 16 years, was assessed 
      for ADHD/DBD with a clinical interview; Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders 
      and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version 
      (K-SADS-PL). Blood was drawn from 247 subjects and analyzed for platelet MAO-B 
      activity and polymorphisms in the MAO-A and 5-HTT genes. RESULTS: We found an 
      association in girls between low platelet MAO-B activity and symptoms of 
      Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). In girls, there was also an association 
      between the heterozygote long/short 5-HTT LPR genotype and symptoms of conduct 
      disorder. Furthermore the heterozygote 5-HTT LPR genotype in boys was found to be 
      associated with symptoms of Conduct Disorder (CD). In boys, hemizygosity for the 
      short MAO-A VNTR allele was associated with disruptive behavior. CONCLUSION: Our 
      study suggests that the serotonin system, in addition to the dopamine system, 
      should be further investigated when studying genetic influences on the 
      development of Disruptive Behavior Disorders.

TI  - Abnormal nerve conduction features in fragile X premutation carriers.
PG  - 495-8
LID - 10.1001/archneur.65.4.495 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Distal neuropathy is part of the clinical phenotype in most males 
      with the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) caused by the 55 to 
      200 CGG repeat expansion. METHODS: We performed nerve conduction studies in 16 
      male carriers with FXTAS, 11 non-FXTAS carriers, and 11 control subjects and 
      assessed the outcomes with respect to the fragile X mental retardation 1 genotype 
      (FMR1) (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] 309550; NT011681) and 
      messenger RNA expression. RESULTS: Men with FXTAS had slower tibial nerve 
      conduction velocities and prolonged F-wave latencies compared with controls (z = 
      2.06, P = .04; and z = 2.73, P = .005) and unaffected premutation males (z = 
      1.98, P = .04; and z = 2.00, P = .04). Compound muscle action potential 
      amplitudes were smaller in the FXTAS group relative to controls. Sural nerve 
      action potential amplitudes were reduced in the FXTAS group compared with 
      controls. After controlling for age, there was a significant relationship between 
      the longer CGG repeat number and tibial nerve conduction velocity slowing (r = 
      -0.42, P = .04) and between elevated messenger RNA levels and reduction of the 
      tibial compound muscle action potential velocity (r = -0.52, P = .01) in the 
      permutation group. CONCLUSIONS: Male premutation carriers had significant 
      conduction abnormalities of motor and sensory nerves that correlated with 
      molecular measures, suggesting that the premutation FMR1 genotype is a causal 
      factor. There was also evidence of nerve conduction abnormalities in non-FXTAS 
      carriers compared with controls, which suggests that the neuropathy can occur 
      without the full clinical presentation of FXTAS.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
      resulting from CAG repeat expansion in the gene that encodes for the protein 
      huntingtin. To identify neuroprotective compound (s) that can slow down disease 
      progression and can be administered long term with few side effects in 
      Huntington's disease, we investigated the effect of sertraline, a selective 
      serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) which has been shown to upregulate BDNF 
      levels in rodent brains. We report here that in HD mice sertraline increased BDNF 
      levels, preserved chaperone protein HSP70 and Bcl-2 levels in brains, attenuated 
      the progression of brain atrophy and behavioral abnormalities and thereby 
      increased survival. Sertraline also enhanced neurogenesis, which appeared to be 
      responsible for mediating the beneficial effects of sertraline in HD mice. 
      Additionally, the effective levels of sertraline are comparable to the safe 
      levels achievable in humans. The findings suggest that sertraline is a potential 
      candidate for treatment of HD patients.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the IT15 gene encoding huntingtin protein (htt). 
      Mutated htt is predicted to acquire toxic properties in specific brain regions. 
      For instance, striatal neurons expressing dopamine receptors predominantly 
      degenerate in HD patients. Although the basis of this specific vulnerability 
      remains unclear, a great deal of evidence has documented the ability of the 
      dopamine system to modulate the toxicity of expanded htt. To investigate the 
      relationship between dopamine receptors and expanded htt, we transfected enhanced 
      green fluorescent proteins (EGFP) tagged to normal (25 CAG) or mutant (103 CAG) 
      htt in SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells that endogenously express D1 receptors. 
      Forming nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates, mutant htt-EGFP was toxic to cells 
      beyond 24 h post-transfection. Remarkably, low doses of a selective D1 receptors 
      agonist or forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, accelerated the 
      formation of mutant htt nuclear aggregates, whereas the number of cytoplasmic 
      aggregates was decreased. These effects were associated with a minor increase in 
      cell death. Understanding the functional bases of these effects may further 
      elucidate the role of dopamine receptors signaling in the complex pathophysiology 
      of HD.

      the therapeutic development of RNAi.
PG  - 5868-73
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0801775105 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal, dominant neurodegenerative disease caused 
      by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in exon 1 of the HD gene, which encodes the 
      huntingtin protein. We and others have shown that RNAi is a candidate therapy for 
      HD because expression of inhibitory RNAs targeting mutant human HD transgenes 
      improved neuropathology and behavioral deficits in HD mouse models. Here, we 
      developed shRNAs targeting conserved sequences in human HD and mouse HD homolog 
      (HDh) mRNAs to initiate preclinical testing in a knockin mouse model of HD. We 
      screened 35 shRNAs in vitro and subsequently narrowed our focus to three 
      candidates for in vivo testing. Unexpectedly, two active shRNAs induced 
      significant neurotoxicity in mouse striatum, although HDh mRNA expression was 
      reduced to similar levels by all three. Additionally, a control shRNA containing 
      mismatches also induced toxicity, although it did not reduce HDh mRNA expression. 
      Interestingly, the toxic shRNAs generated higher antisense RNA levels, compared 
      with the nontoxic shRNA. These results demonstrate that the robust levels of 
      antisense RNAs emerging from shRNA expression systems can be problematic in the 
      mouse brain. Importantly, when sequences that were toxic in the context of shRNAs 
      were placed into artificial microRNA (miRNA) expression systems, molecular and 
      neuropathological readouts of neurotoxicity were significantly attenuated without 
      compromising mouse HDh silencing efficacy. Thus, miRNA-based approaches may 
      provide more appropriate biological tools for expressing inhibitory RNAs in the 
      brain, the implications of which are crucial to the development of RNAi for both 
      basic biological and therapeutic applications.

AB  - Genotypes and allelic frequencies of TPH2, 5-HTTLPR, the 5-HTT (SLC6A4) intron 2 
      variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) region, and the MAOA VNTR region were 
      determined in brain-stem samples of 20 "genuine" SIDS cases and compared with 
      results obtained from 150 healthy controls. The SNP G1463A responsible for 80% 
      functionality loss of TPH2 (tryptophan hydroxylase 2) was not detected, neither 
      in SIDS infants nor in the controls. In contrast, a strict relation was found 
      between the 5-HTTLPR genotype and its allelic frequencies with SIDS cases. The 
      L/L genotype and the long allele (L) of the promoter region of the serotonin 
      transporter were significantly associated (likelihood ratio (LR) test, p<0.001) 
      with the syndrome (L/L, 60% SIDS vs 14% controls; L, 80% SIDS vs 42.6% controls). 
      Polymorphisms of the intron 2 VNTR of the same gene showed a trend for 
      significant differences between genotypes 10/10 and 12/12 (LR test, p=0.068), 
      with the L-12 haplotype being almost twofold in SIDS (44.5%) with respect to 
      controls (23.4%). Differences were even higher considering the genotype 
      combination L/L-12/12 (20% SIDS vs 2.6%), and variations among categories were 
      statistically highly significant (p<0.001). Although additional differences were 
      observed in the frequency of the MAOA (monoamine oxidase A) VNTR genotype 3R/3R 
      between SIDS and controls (respectively 15% vs 26%), the results were not 
      supported by statistical significance. Molecular polymorphisms are discussed 
      considering their functional role in regulating serotonin synthesis (TPH2), 
      neuronal reuptake (5-HTTLPR and 5-HTT intron 2), and catabolism (MAOA) in the 
      nervous system of Italian SIDS infants. Comparisons are made with previous data 
      obtained in different ethnic groups.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of hereditary mental retardation. The 
      molecular basis of this syndrome is mainly a CGG expansion in the 5' untranslated 
      region of the FMR1 gene. Expansions with more than 200 CGG repeats abolish gene 
      expression causing the classical fragile X phenotype. Premutation carriers 
      (55-200 CGG) have normal cognitive function with increased risk of developing 
      premature ovarian failure and fragile X-associated tremor-ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS). Some clinical features associated with FXTAS, such as tremor, gait 
      ataxia, cognitive decline, and generalized brain atrophy, are also seen in other 
      movement disorders. Ninety-five patients referred for HD, who tested negative for 
      the expansion in the IT15 gene, were screened for FMR1 CGG-repeat expansion. One 
      FMR1 premutation male carrier was detected, giving an FXTAS frequency of 1.6%. 
      Our results highlight that FXTAS is still not well diagnosed; therefore, we 
      recommend FMR1 premutation screenings in all patients with late-onset tremor, 
      ataxia, and cognitive dysfunction.

LID - e1000033
AB  - Nondisjunction of chromosome 21 is the leading cause of Down syndrome. Two risk 
      factors for maternal nondisjunction of chromosome 21 are increased maternal age 
      and altered recombination. In order to provide further insight on mechanisms 
      underlying nondisjunction, we examined the association between these two well 
      established risk factors for chromosome 21 nondisjunction. In our approach, short 
      tandem repeat markers along chromosome 21 were genotyped in DNA collected from 
      individuals with free trisomy 21 and their parents. This information was used to 
      determine the origin of the nondisjunction error and the maternal recombination 
      profile. We analyzed 615 maternal meiosis I and 253 maternal meiosis II cases 
      stratified by maternal age. The examination of meiosis II errors, the first of 
      its type, suggests that the presence of a single exchange within the 
      pericentromeric region of 21q interacts with maternal age-related risk factors. 
      This observation could be explained in two general ways: 1) a pericentromeric 
      exchange initiates or exacerbates the susceptibility to maternal age risk factors 
      or 2) a pericentromeric exchange protects the bivalent against age-related risk 
      factors allowing proper segregation of homologues at meiosis I, but not 
      segregation of sisters at meiosis II. In contrast, analysis of maternal meiosis I 
      errors indicates that a single telomeric exchange imposes the same risk for 
      nondisjunction, irrespective of the age of the oocyte. Our results emphasize the 
      fact that human nondisjunction is a multifactorial trait that must be dissected 
      into its component parts to identify specific associated risk factors.

TI  - Low level of harm avoidance is associated with serotonin transporter functional 
      haplotype in alcohol-dependent individuals.
PG  - 59-63
LID - 10.1097/YPG.0b013e3282f60333 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) encodes a trans-membrane 
      protein (5-HTT) that plays an important role in regulating serotonergic 
      neurotransmission, which is known to be involved in many psychiatric disorders. A 
      polymorphism in the transcriptional control region containing long (L) and short 
      (S) variants (5-HTTLPR) as well as alleles of the variable number tandem repeats 
      (VNTR) region were demonstrated. Higher serotonin levels among carriers of the S 
      allele might exhibit increased liability of serotonin-mediated, 
      psychopathology-like anxiety and depression and may impair social skills 
      reflected by harm avoidance. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the data of alcohol-dependent, 
      unrelated German individuals for a significant association between serotonin 
      transporter gene and history of depression as well as TCI scales. METHODS: We 
      characterized 368 alcohol-dependent participants by TCI and SSAGA/history of 
      depression. HHT and VNTR genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. MAIN 
      RESULTS: No significant association was found between history of depression and 
      5-HTTLPR (F=0.42, P=0.65, d.f.=2) as well as between history of depression and 
      VNTR (F=0.24, P=0.91, d.f.=2). As harm avoidance is often associated with history 
      of depression, the TCI was used. Regarding the TCI temperament and character 
      scale scores, no significant association was found between harm avoidance and 
      this genetic variant 5-HTTLPR (F=0.55, P=0.57, d.f.=2), and between harm 
      avoidance and VNTR (F=0.39, P=0.81, d.f.=2). Haplotype analysis showed 
      significant relationship between low level of harm avoidance and haplotype S/12 
      (chi=7.01, P=0.00). Haplotype analysis of history of depression (chi=2.04, 
      P=0.742) showed no significant result. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate an 
      association between S/12 haplotype of SLC6A4 and low level of harm avoidance.

AB  - The efficacy of serotonin reuptake inhibitors in depression and anxiety disorders 
      suggests the gene coding for the serotonin transporter (5-HTT), SLC6A4, as a 
      candidate of importance for these conditions. Positive findings regarding 
      associations between polymorphisms in SLC6A4 have been reported, indicating that 
      these polymorphisms may influence anxiety-related personality traits, as well as 
      the risk of developing depression and suicidality. Serotonin 5-HTT availability 
      was assessed with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), using 
      (123)I-beta-CIT as ligand, in a population of unmedicated male suicide attempters 
      (n=9) and in matched controls (n=9). Two polymorphisms in SLC6A4 were assessed, 
      including the 5-HTTLPR located in the promoter region and a variable number of 
      tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism in intron 2 (STin2). In suicide attempters, 
      but not in controls, low 5-HTT availability was associated with the S allele of 
      5-HTTLPR and with the 12 repeat allele of STin2. Data suggest that polymorphisms 
      in SLC6A4 may influence the expression of the brain serotonin transporter in 
      suicide attempters.

TI  - DNA instability in postmitotic neurons.
PG  - 3467-72
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0800048105 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion that is unstable 
      upon germ-line transmission and exhibits mosaicism in somatic tissues. We show 
      that region-specific CAG repeat mosaicism profiles are conserved between several 
      mouse models of HD and therefore develop in a predetermined manner. Furthermore, 
      we demonstrate that these synchronous, radical changes in CAG repeat size occur 
      in terminally differentiated neurons. In HD this ongoing mutation of the repeat 
      continuously generates genetically distinct neuronal populations in the adult 
      brain of mouse models and HD patients. The neuronal population of the striatum is 
      particularly distinguished by a high rate of CAG repeat allele instability and 
      expression driving the repeat upwards and would be expected to enhance its 
      toxicity. In both mice and humans, neurons are distinguished from nonneuronal 
      cells by expression of MSH3, which provides a permissive environment for genetic 
      instability independent of pathology. The neuronal mutations described here 
      accumulate to generate genetically discrete populations of cells in the absence 
      of selection. This is in contrast to the traditional view in which genetically 
      discrete cellular populations are generated by the sequence of random variation, 
      selection, and clonal proliferation. We are unaware of any previous demonstration 
      that mutations can occur in terminally differentiated neurons and provide a proof 
      of principle that, dependent on a specific set of conditions, functional DNA 
      polymorphisms can be produced in adult neurons.

      3 VNTR in nonhuman primates.
PG  - 139-42
LID - 10.1007/s10329-007-0077-7 [doi]
AB  - A variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism based on a 16 or 17-bp 
      unit has been reported in the third intron of the human serotonin transporter 
      gene (5-HTT). VNTRs have been shown to affect the transcriptional activity of 
      genes, and VNTR polymorphisms possibly influence human personality and several 
      psychoneurological disorders. To estimate the changes that occurred in the VNTRs 
      during primate evolution, we amplified and sequenced the regions that 
      corresponded to the human VNTRs in various primate species, including apes, Old 
      World monkeys, and New World monkeys. The VNTR sequences were polymorphic in all 
      the ape species examined, and alleles with repeat numbers of 18, 19, 23, and 24 
      in chimpanzees, 33, 35, 36, 38, and 40 in gorillas, 4 and 6 in orangutans, and 
      11, 13, 14, and 15 in gibbons were found. On the other hand, only a 5-repeat 
      allele was detected in Old World monkeys such as the Japanese macaque and patas 
      monkey. In this study we demonstrated for the first time that a repeat structure 
      was not present in the corresponding regions in the New World monkeys examined, 
      and only one unit sequence was found in them. These results suggested that the 
      duplication of a unit in the VNTR region occurred in the Cercopithecidae species 
      following the divergence of the Old World and New World monkeys, and various long 
      repeated alleles were generated in humans and apes, except orangutans.

TI  - Case-control and within-family tests for an association between conduct disorder 
      and DAT1.
PG  - 17-24
LID - 10.1097/YPG.0b013e3282ef48c8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conduct disorder (CD) is characterized by a persistent pattern of 
      violating age-appropriate norms and the rights of others, and is one of the most 
      frequently diagnosed disorders among children. CD is moderately heritable, but we 
      know of no reliable associations with specific genes. Evidence suggests that a 
      variable number tandem repeat polymorphism of the dopamine transporter (DAT1) 
      gene may be associated with externalizing behavior in children. OBJECTIVE: To 
      test for an association between the DAT1 gene and CD. DESIGN: Case-control 
      analyses and a transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) were conducted. 
      SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Cases were (n=210) adolescents enrolled in a Colorado 
      treatment program for conduct and substance use problems. Controls included 
      adolescents matched to the probands in the treatment program and their siblings 
      (n=162). The TDT was conducted using case families in which DNA from both parents 
      was available (95 trios). RESULTS: The case-control analysis of the full sample 
      did not result in a significant association [chi2 (2,372)=0.13, P=0.94]. Cases 
      with early-onset conduct problems had slightly more 10-repeat alleles than 
      controls, although this difference was not significant [chi2 (2,264)=2.19, 
      P=0.33, 9/10 odds ratio (OR)=1.58, 10/10 OR=2.14]. The TDT also did not result in 
      a significant association [chi2(1)=0.12, P=0.94]. CONCLUSION: Results did not 
      support an association between this polymorphism of the DAT1 gene and CD in 
      adolescents.

TI  - Huntingtin-associated protein-1 is a modifier of the age-at-onset of Huntington's 
      disease.

AB  - A polyglutamine repeat expansion of more than 36 units in a protein called 
      huntingtin (htt) is the only known cause of Huntington's disease (HD). The 
      expanded repeat length is inversely correlated with the age-at-onset (AAO), 
      however, the onset age among HD patients with CAG repeats below 60 units varies 
      considerably. In addition to environmental factors, genetic factors different 
      from the expanded CAG repeat length can modify the AAO of HD. We hypothezised 
      that htt interacting proteins might contribute to this variation in the AAO and 
      investigated human htt-associated protein-1 (HAP1) using genetic and functional 
      assays. We identified six polymorphisms in the HAP1 gene including one that 
      substitutes methionine (M441) for threonine (T441) at amino acid 441. Analyzing 
      980 European HD patients, we found that patients homozygous for the M441 genotype 
      show an 8-year delay in the AAO. Functional assays demonstrated that human 
      M441-HAP1 interacts with mutant htt more tightly than does human T441-HAP1, 
      reduces soluble htt degraded products and protects against htt-mediated toxicity. 
      We thus provide genetic and functional evidence that the M441-HAP1 polymorphism 
      modifies the AAO of HD.

TI  - Impact of the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene premutation on 
      neuropsychiatric functioning in adult males without fragile X-associated 
      Tremor/Ataxia syndrome: a controlled study.
PG  - 859-72
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.30685 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X Syndrome is the most common heritable form of mental retardation caused 
      by silencing of the FMR1 gene, which arises from intergenerational trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion leading to full mutation. An intermediary carrier condition, 
      known as the premutation, is characterized by expansion up to 200 repeats without 
      concomitant gene silencing. This prevalent allelic variant was initially thought 
      to be free of phenotypic effects. However, recent reports have identified a 
      degenerative disease, Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) in 
      older men as well as premature ovarian failure in women. Previously reports are 
      inconsistent regarding the neuropsychiatric phenotype associated with premutation 
      due to small sample sizes, ascertainment bias, lack of adequate control groups, 
      administration of measures with poor psychometric properties, and the confounding 
      effects of FXTAS. We addressed these problems by conducting a controlled study of 
      male carriers (n = 40) of the premutation without manifest symptoms of FXTAS, 
      comparing their responses on specific, reliable, and valid measures of 
      neuropsychiatric functioning to those of individuals with shared family 
      environment (n = 22) and non-carrier comparison males (n = 43). Multivariate 
      analyses revealed that the premutation confers significant risk for working 
      memory difficulties, an associated feature of Attention-Deficit Disorder. 
      Furthermore, both the family controls and men with premutation exhibited higher 
      rates of Alcohol Abuse as compared to non-carrier control men. These findings 
      highlight the importance of recognizing the distinct phenotypic outcomes that 
      characterize the Fragile X premutation and the subtle risk factors that can act 
      as precursors to more significant psychiatric impairment.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome, which is caused by expansion of a (CGG)(n) repeat in the FMR1 
      gene, occurs in approximately 1:3500 males and causes mental 
      retardation/behavioral problems. Smaller (CGG)(n) repeat expansions in FMR1, 
      premutations, are associated with premature ovarian failure and fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. An FMR1-sizing assay is technically 
      challenging because of high GC content of the (CGG)(n) repeat, the size 
      limitations of conventional PCR, and a lack of reference materials available for 
      test development/validation and routine quality control. The Centers for Disease 
      Control and Prevention and the Association for Molecular Pathology, together with 
      the genetic testing community, have addressed the need for characterized fragile 
      X mutation reference materials by developing characterized DNA samples from 16 
      cell lines with repeat lengths representing important phenotypic classes and 
      diagnostic cutoffs. The alleles in these materials were characterized by 
      consensus analysis in nine clinical laboratories. The information generated from 
      this study is available on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 
      Coriell Cell Repositories websites. DNA purified from these cell lines is 
      available to the genetics community through the Coriell Cell Repositories. The 
      public availability of these reference materials should help support accurate 
      clinical fragile X syndrome testing.

TI  - Time-lapse analysis of aggregate formation in an inducible PC12 cell model of 
      Huntington's disease reveals time-dependent aggregate formation that transiently 
      delays cell death.
PG  - 146-57
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of the HD gene. The translated 
      polyglutamine expansion causes the formation of insoluble aggregates in the 
      brains of HD patients and transgenic mouse models. However, the relationship 
      between aggregate formation and neuropathology remains unknown. We used 
      fluorescent protein tagging and live-cell time-lapse microscopy to study visible 
      aggregate formation and its relationship to cell death in transgenic PC12 cells. 
      We used cell lines expressing a fragment of huntingtin exon 1 with either 23 
      (wild type) or 74 (mutant) glutamines fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein 
      under the control of an inducible promoter. Live cells were observed in real time 
      after transgene induction for up to 96 h. We found that aggregate formation was 
      time-dependent and predominantly nuclear in these cells. We followed inclusion 
      formation in individual cells, examining the cells every 10 min for up to 48 h. 
      This revealed new details of inclusion formation. Initial aggregate formation was 
      rapid (often <1 h), but many (18->48) h were needed to establish a final 
      aggregate phenotype. Aggregates formed in a dynamic manner and were in constant 
      motion within cell nuclei throughout their maturation. The formation of large 
      aggregates occurred more frequently in cells that survived longer. However, 
      aggregate size was not a good predictor of cell death, since cells could die with 
      either large (>2 microm), small (<0.5 microm) or no visible aggregates. Cells 
      that formed large aggregates survived longer than cells that formed small 
      aggregates or no aggregates at all. However, the time taken for a cell to die 
      decreased as a function of increasing size of final aggregate formed. Further, 
      cells that formed aggregates earlier tended to die earlier. Together our data are 
      compatible with a toxic role for aggregates/aggregation and support the 'toxic 
      precursor' hypothesis. However, they also suggest that at some stages, the 
      process of aggregate formation is cytoprotective.

TI  - Huntington disease mutation in Venezuela: age of onset, haplotype analyses and 
      geographic aggregation.

AB  - The aggregation of patients with Huntington's disease (HD) around Lake Maracaibo, 
      Zulia State, Venezuela, is widely recognized, but the epidemiology of HD in the 
      whole country is relatively unstudied. We have examined 279 individuals from 60 
      unrelated affected families residing in various areas of Venezuela for the 
      presence of CAG repeats and other features associated with HD. The number of 
      expanded repeats in 139 carriers varied from 35 to 112. Based on our examination 
      of 71 symptomatic individuals, we developed a log-transformed regression 
      equation, y= -0.0238x + 2.6616, to enable the prediction of age of onset in 
      asymptomatic carriers. Intragenic haplotypes were constructed with two VNTRs 
      (variable number of tandem repeats) and two SNPs (single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms) in the promoter region as well as CCG repeat and Delta2642 
      polymorphisms to assess kinship between families. In 43 of 45 tested families, 
      the haplotype on the mutated chromosome was 1;G;C;7;(A). The other haplotypes 
      observed, 1;G;C;7;(B) and 4;G;C;7;(A), were of Peruvian and French origins, 
      respectively. The geographic source of the first affected ancestor was assessed 
      in 54 families from 15 different states. Residents of the states of Miranda, Lara 
      and Tachira, excluding those of Zulia, had a mutated allele prevalence five- to 
      ninefold higher than that of other areas. A low (approx. 1/200,000) prevalence, a 
      wide-spread distribution with aggregation in some states and a likely remote 
      European Caucasoid origin are defining epidemiologic features of HD in Venezuela.

TI  - Serotonin transporter gene polymorphism and BPSD in mild Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 245-53
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to confirm an association of functional 
      polymorphism within the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene with Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in mild 
      AD. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene polymorphism and 2 types of functional 
      polymorphism in the 5-HTT gene, 5-HTT-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and a 
      5-HTT variable number of tandem repeats sequence (5-HTTVNTR) were analyzed 
      longitudinally in outpatients with mild AD to find out whether there was a 
      relation between any such polymorphisms and the occurrence of BPSD. No 
      significant differences in genotype distribution or allele frequencies were 
      identified for 5-HTTLPR or 5-HTTVNTR between AD patients and age- and sex-matched 
      non-demented controls regardless of ApoE epsilon4 allele. No significant 
      differences were noted in 5-HTTLPR genotype or allele distributions between AD 
      patients with or without BPSD. However, significant associations were observed 
      between presence of 5-HTTVNTR allele 10 and BPSD or aggressiveness. This 
      difference was independent of the presence of the ApoE epsilon4 allele. As a 
      result, 5-HTT polymorphisms are unlikely to play any substantial role in 
      susceptibility to AD. Conversely, 5-HTTVNTR influences the risk of developing 
      BPSD or aggressiveness and genetic variations in the 5-HTT gene may be involved 
      in the development of symptomatology for mild AD.

TI  - Association between the serotonin transporter gene and personality traits in 
      borderline personality disorder patients evaluated with Zuckerman-Zuhlman 
      Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ).
PG  - 382-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The serotoninergic system seems to be implicated in characteristic 
      symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) such as affective instability, 
      impulsivity or suicide. Some studies suggest an association between serotonin 
      transporter gene (5-HTT) polymorphisms and some BPD symptoms. Short allele (S) of 
      the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in the promoter region has been shown to be associated 
      with impulsivity, aggressive behavior, anxiety and neuroticism. Of the variable 
      number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in intron 2, BPD patients showed 
      higher frequencies of the allele with the 10 repeats. The aim of this study was 
      to determine the association between 5- HTTLPR and VNTR polymorphism of 5-HTT and 
      personality traits in borderline personality disorder. METHOD: A total of 65 BPD 
      patients diagnosed by means of semi-structured interviews SCID-II and DIB-R were 
      included. Two common polymorphisms of 5-HTT were genotyped: the 5-HTTLPR in the 
      promoter region and VNTR in intron 2. Personality traits were assessed by the 
      Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ). RESULTS: Patients with L 
      allele (L/S or L/L) in the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism showed lower scores on the 
      subscale of liking parties and friends. Patients with the allele with 10 repeat 
      of the VNTR polymorphism, showed lower scores in impulsivity, sensation seeking 
      and in the subscale liking of parties and friends. CONCLUSIONS: The results 
      suggest a significant association between the 5-HTT gene and some personality 
      traits in BPD. This gene may play a role in the etiology of borderline 
      personality disorder.

TI  - Parenting quality interacts with genetic variation in dopamine receptor D4 to 
      influence temperament in early childhood.
PG  - 1039-46
AB  - We examined the influence of a common allelic variation in the dopamine receptor 
      D4 (DRD4) gene and caregiver quality on temperament in early childhood. Children 
      18-21 months of age were genotyped for the DRD4 48 base pair tandem repeat 
      polymorphism, which has been implicated in the development of attention, 
      sensation seeking, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The children 
      also interacted with their caregiver for 10 min in a laboratory setting, and 
      these videotaped interactions were coded for parenting quality using an 
      observational rating procedure. The presence of the DRD4 7-repeat allele was 
      associated with differences in the influence of parenting on a measure of 
      temperamental sensation seeking constructed from caregiver reports on children's 
      activity level, impulsivity, and high-intensity pleasure. Children with the 
      7-repeat allele were influenced by parenting quality, with lower quality 
      parenting associated with higher levels of sensation seeking; children without 
      the 7-repeat allele were uninfluenced by parenting quality. Differences between 
      alleles were not related to the child's self-regulation as assessed by the 
      effortful control measure. Previous studies have indicated that the 7-repeat 
      allele is under positive selective pressure, and our results are consistent with 
      the hypothesis that the DRD4 7-repeat allele increased children's sensitivity to 
      environmental factors such as parenting. This study shows that genes influence 
      the relation between parenting and temperament in ways that are important to 
      normal development and psychopathology.

TI  - Glutamate uptake is reduced in prefrontal cortex in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 232-7
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HD gene, but 
      how this mutation causes neuronal dysfunction and degeneration is unclear. 
      Inhibition of glutamate uptake, which could cause excessive stimulation of 
      glutamate receptors, has been found in animals carrying very long CAG repeats in 
      the HD gene. In seven HD patients with moderate CAG expansions (40-52), repeat 
      expansion and HD grade at autopsy were strongly correlated (r=0.88, p=0.0002). 
      Uptake of [(3)H]glutamate was reduced by 43% in prefrontal cortex, but the level 
      of synaptic (synaptophysin, AMPA receptors) and astrocytic markers (GFAP, 
      glutamate transporter EAAT1) were unchanged. Glutamate uptake correlated 
      inversely with CAG repeat expansion (r= -0.82, p=0.015). The reducing agent 
      dithiothreitol improved glutamate uptake in controls, but not in HD brains, 
      suggesting irreversible oxidation of glutamate transporters in HD. We conclude 
      that impairment of glutamate uptake may contribute to neuronal dysfunction and 
      degeneration in HD.

TI  - Volumetric brain changes in females with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome (FXTAS).
PG  - 851-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder occurring in male and rare female carriers of a 
      premutation expansion (55 to 200 CGG repeats) of the fragile X mental retardation 
      1 (FMR1) gene. METHODS: Volumetric MRI studies, clinical staging, cognitive 
      testing, and molecular analysis were conducted in 15 female premutation carriers 
      affected by FXTAS (age 59.5 +/- 10.3 years), 20 unaffected female carriers (43.3 
      +/- 11.2 years), 11 genetically normal female controls (51.0 +/- 10.3 years), 36 
      affected male carriers (65.0 +/- 5.6 years), 25 unaffected male carriers (53.5 
      +/- 12.5 years), and 39 male controls (58.0 +/- 15.0 years). Female and male 
      carriers with FXTAS were matched on duration of disease. RESULTS: We found less 
      pronounced reductions of cerebellar volume and a lower incidence of involvement 
      (symmetric high T2 signal) of the middle cerebellar peduncles (MCP sign) in 
      females affected by FXTAS (13%) compared with affected males (58%). We found 
      reduced brain volumes and increased white matter disease associated with the 
      presence of FXTAS in females compared with female controls. We also observed 
      significant associations between reduced cerebellar volume and both increased 
      severity of FXTAS symptoms and increased length of the CGG repeat expansion in 
      male premutation carriers, but not in females. CONCLUSIONS: Females affected by 
      fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) demonstrated milder brain 
      changes than affected males, although they showed a similar pattern of radiologic 
      findings consistent with brain atrophy and white matter disease. FXTAS should be 
      considered (by ordering fragile X DNA testing) in females who present with 
      late-onset ataxia, action tremor, or neuropathy, particularly in those with a 
      family history of mental retardation, autism, or premature ovarian failure.

TI  - Intergeneration CAG expansion in a Wuhan juvenile-onset Huntington disease 
      family.
PG  - 198-202
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To make early diagnosis of IT15 gene mutation in a Wuhan 
      juvenile-onset Huntington disease (HD) family, for providing them with genetic 
      counseling, and making preparation for the further research on pathogenesis and 
      experimental therapy of HD. METHODS: According to the principle of informed 
      consent, we extracted genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples and carried 
      genetic diagnosis of pathogenic exon 1 of IT15 gene by modified touchdown PCR and 
      DNA sequencing methods. RESULTS: Eight of twenty-five family members carried 
      abnormal allele: III(10), III(12), III(14), IV(3), and V(2) carried (CAG) (48), 
      IV(11) and IV(12) carried (CAG) (67), and IV(14) carried (CAG) (63), in contrast 
      with the 8-25 CAG trinucleotides in the members of control group. IV(14) carried 
      15 more CAG trinucleotides than her father III(10). CONCLUSION: The results 
      definitely confirm the diagnosis of HD and indicate the CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion of IT15 gene in this HD family. In addition, CAG expansion results in 
      juvenile-onset and anticipation (characterized by earlier age of onset and 
      increasing severity) of the patient IV(12).

TI  - Early energy deficit in Huntington disease: identification of a plasma biomarker 
      traceable during disease progression.
PG  - e647
LID - e647
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder, with no effective 
      treatment. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying HD has not been elucidated, but 
      weight loss, associated with chorea and cognitive decline, is a characteristic 
      feature of the disease that is accessible to investigation. We, therefore, 
      performed a multiparametric study exploring body weight and the mechanisms of its 
      loss in 32 presymptomatic carriers and HD patients in the early stages of the 
      disease, compared to 21 controls. We combined this study with a multivariate 
      statistical analysis of plasma components quantified by proton nuclear magnetic 
      resonance ((1)H NMR) spectroscopy. We report evidence of an early hypermetabolic 
      state in HD. Weight loss was observed in the HD group even in presymptomatic 
      carriers, although their caloric intake was higher than that of controls. 
      Inflammatory processes and primary hormonal dysfunction were excluded. (1)H NMR 
      spectroscopy on plasma did, however, distinguish HD patients at different stages 
      of the disease and presymptomatic carriers from controls. This distinction was 
      attributable to low levels of the branched chain amino acids (BCAA), valine, 
      leucine and isoleucine. BCAA levels were correlated with weight loss and, 
      importantly, with disease progression and abnormal triplet repeat expansion size 
      in the HD1 gene. Levels of IGF1, which is regulated by BCAA, were also 
      significantly lower in the HD group. Therefore, early weight loss in HD is 
      associated with a systemic metabolic defect, and BCAA levels may be used as a 
      biomarker, indicative of disease onset and early progression. The decreased 
      plasma levels of BCAA may correspond to a critical need for Krebs cycle energy 
      substrates in the brain that increased metabolism in the periphery is trying to 
      provide.

TI  - Argonaute-2-dependent rescue of a Drosophila model of FXTAS by FRAXE premutation 
      repeat.
PG  - 2326-32
AB  - Fragile X Syndrome is the most common form of hereditary mental retardation. It 
      is caused by a large expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat (>200 repeats) in 
      the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of the FMR1 gene that leads to silencing of its 
      transcript. Individuals with CGG repeat expansions approximately between 60 and 
      200 are referred to as premutation carriers. Fragile X-associated tremor and 
      ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), an RNA-mediated neurodegenerative disease has been 
      described in up to 50% of males carrying premutation alleles. FRAXE, the most 
      common form of non-syndromic X-linked mental retardation, is caused by expansion 
      of a CCG trinucleotide repeat (>200) in the 5'-UTR of the FMR2 gene. While the 
      FRAXE premutation length repeat is observed in the general population, there has 
      not yet been a report of a neurodegenerative phenotype associated with these 
      alleles. In this study, we show that the CCG premutation length repeat leads to 
      an RNA-mediated neurodegenerative phenotype in a Drosophila model. Furthermore, 
      we show that co-expression of both the CCG and CGG-containing RNAs suppresses 
      their independent toxicity and is dependent on the RNAi pathway. These data 
      support the concept that RNA toxicity is the mechanism of neuronal toxicity and 
      suggests potential reversal of RNA-mediated phenotypes with complementary RNA 
      molecules.

TI  - PCR approach for detection of Fragile X syndrome and Huntington disease based on 
      modified DNA: limits and utility.
PG  - 153-9
AB  - A group of mutations characterized by trinucleotide repeat expansion causes human 
      diseases such as the Fragile X syndrome, Huntington disease (HD), and myotonic 
      dystrophy. Methods based on PCR amplification of the CGG and CAG repeats region 
      could facilitate the development of a rapid screening assay; unfortunately, 
      amplification across CGG and CAG repeats can be inefficient and unreliable due to 
      the G + C base composition. The utility of the PCR on modified DNA for 
      amplification of the CGG and CAG repeats at the Fragile X syndrome and HD has 
      been reported. In the present study, we analyzed the utility of PCR on modified 
      DNA as a rapid screening method for diagnosis of patients with Fragile X syndrome 
      and HD. A comparative analysis realized with 38 Fragile X and 29 HD patients 
      showed that the molecular diagnosis by simple PCR on modified DNA has a 
      sensitivity and specificity of 100% in Fragile X patients and 94.1% and 91.6% in 
      HD patients. The results achieved from the statistical analysis allowed us to 
      conclude that the amplification by simple PCR on modified DNA is a reliable and 
      useful method for the molecular diagnosis of the Fragile X syndrome, but not for 
      the HD.

      syndrome.
PG  - 349-56
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated patients with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS), a neurodegenerative disorder associated with a CGG repeat expansion in 
      the premutation range in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. METHODS: 
      Neurological, psychiatric and neuropsychological evaluations were performed on 15 
      male patients with FXTAS. RESULTS: Seven cases were diagnosed with dementia, and 
      seven others were diagnosed with mood and/or anxiety disorders. Twelve subjects 
      demonstrated deficits on neuropsychological testing. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians 
      assessing dementia patients are urged to consider this newly described syndrome, 
      especially in patients with dementia associated with a movement disorder and in 
      those with a family history of mental retardation. If FXTAS is a possible 
      diagnosis, physicians may carry out FMR1 DNA testing; patients who test positive 
      on DNA testing should undergo magnetic resonance imaging, be referred to 
      neurology and receive genetic counseling.

TI  - NR2A and NR2B receptor gene variations modify age at onset in Huntington disease 
      in a sex-specific manner.
PG  - 175-82
AB  - In addition to the pathogenetic CAG repeat expansion other genetic factors play a 
      significant role in determining age at onset (AO) in Huntington disease (HD), 
      e.g. variations in the NR2A and NR2B glutamate receptor subunit genes (GRIN2A, 
      GRIN2B). In order to expand these findings we fine-mapped a larger HD patient 
      panel (n = 250) using densely spaced markers flanking the originally associated 
      SNPs in GRIN2A and GRIN2B. In GRIN2A association fine-mapping based on eight 
      additional SNPs confirmed intron 2 as the region of strongest association. In 
      GRIN2B fine-mapping with seven additional SNPs consolidated C2664T as causal 
      genetic variation. Gender stratification of patients revealed differences in the 
      variability in AO attributable to the CAG repeat number and highly significant 
      differences in the AO association with the C2664T and rs8057394/ rs2650427 
      variations. Addition of the corresponding genotype variations to the effect of 
      CAG repeat lengths resulted in a significant increase of the R2 values only in 
      females. The sex-specific effect for C2664T is underscored by differences in the 
      genotype and allele frequencies observed for female versus male HD patients (P = 
      0.01) caused by decreased CC frequency in females. Overall, female HD patients 
      homozygous for the CC genotype tended to have later AO compared to the other two 
      genotypes. Stratification of the results by presumed menopausal status 
      demonstrated that the significant findings were predominantly observed in 
      pre-menopausal patients. We speculate that altered hormone levels herald 
      protective effects of this genotype. Together, GRIN2A and GRIN2B genotype 
      variations explain 7.2% additional variance in AO for HD.

TI  - Psychiatric and cognitive difficulties as indicators of juvenile huntington 
      disease onset in 29 patients.
PG  - 813-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Juvenile Huntington disease (JHD) is a rare clinical entity 
      characterized by an age at onset younger than 20 years. Patients usually have an 
      expansion of more than 60 CAG repeats in the Huntington disease (HD) gene, and 
      the disease is usually inherited from the father. In general, precise age at 
      onset is difficult to assess in HD because of insidious onset and anosognosia. 
      Onset of motor difficulty signs is usually used to define age at onset. 
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate diagnosis delay in patients with JHD and to analyze the 
      clinical and genetic features of JHD. DESIGN: Retrospective clinical and genetic 
      review. SETTING: Referral center for HD at Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, France. 
      PATIENTS: Twenty-nine patients with HD with onset before or at age 20 years who 
      carried an abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the HD gene. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD 
      delay before diagnosis was 9 +/- 6 years (range, 0-21 years). The most remarkable 
      signs at onset were severe psychiatric and cognitive disturbances (19 of 29 
      [65.5%]); rigidity was absent. Unusual signs at onset included myoclonic head 
      tremor in 3 patients, severe isolated drug or alcohol addiction in 2, psychotic 
      disorder in 1, and difficulty writing in 1. One patient had progressive 
      cerebellar signs associated with cerebellar atrophy on cerebral magnetic 
      resonance imaging before signs suggestive of HD appeared. During the course of 
      the disease, psychiatric disturbances were severe, with at least 1 suicide 
      attempt in 7 of 29 patients. Transmission was maternal in 25% of patients. 
      Forty-six percent of patients with JHD had fewer than 60 CAG repeats; 6 of these 
      patients inherited the disease from their father. Anticipation (mean +/- SD, 18 
      +/- 9 vs 25 +/- 11 years; P = .27) and age at onset (mean +/- SD, 17.14 +/- 2.2 
      vs 13.29 +/- 5.5 years; P = .09) was similar in patients with maternal compared 
      with paternal transmission, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with JHD started 
      showing disease symptoms through nonspecific features, mostly psychiatric and 
      cognitive difficulties. This led to misdiagnosis or diagnosis delay, especially 
      in cases without a familial history of HD. Maternal transmissions and expansions 
      of fewer than 60 CAG repeats were unexpectedly frequent in this series and should 
      not be considered exceptional.

TI  - Serotonin transporter gene (5-Htt): association analysis with temporal lobe 
      epilepsy.
PG  - 52-6
AB  - Two functional polymorphisms, a 44bp insertion/deletion polymorphism in the 5' 
      regulatory region and a variable number of tandem repeat polymorphisms in the 
      second intron of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT), were previously 
      identified and suggested to modulate transcription. The current study was 
      designed to determine the contribution of these polymorphisms in the 5-HTT gene 
      to susceptibility to temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Two hundred and seventy six 
      patients with TLE, and 309 age- and sex-matched healthy controls from Calabria 
      (Southern Italy) were studied. Patients and controls were genotyped using the 
      WAVE TM DNA Fragment Analysis System for the insertion/deletion polymorphism in 
      the promoter region (5-HTTLPR), and the GENESCAN TM System for the variable 
      number tandem repeat (VNTR) in the second intron of the 5-HTT gene (5-HTTVNTR). 
      The program UNPHASED was used to compare genotype, allele and haplotype 
      frequencies between cases and controls, including age and gender as covariates in 
      the model. No significant differences between cases and controls were observed 
      for 5-HTTLPR, but a significant association was obtained for the 5-HTTVNTR 
      polymorphism, both modeling genotypes (P-value=0.0145) or alleles 
      (P-value=0.0086). Patients with TLE showed lower frequencies of the 10 repeat at 
      5-HTTVNTR than the controls (26.2% in patients versus 40.8% in controls). The 
      frequency of homozygous individuals for the 10 allele was observed to be lower 
      among patients than the controls (5.2% of patients were 10/10 versus 18.8% of 
      controls). Haplotype analysis did not increase the evidence for association. 
      These results suggest that the serotonin transporter gene may play a role in the 
      etiology of TLE.

TI  - Neuronal intranuclear and neuropil inclusions for pathological assessment of 
      Huntington's disease.
PG  - 31-7
AB  - To evaluate the usefulness of neuronal intranuclear inclusions and neuropil 
      inclusions for the pathological assessment of Huntington's disease (HD), their 
      presence in neocortex was assessed by ubiquitin and N-terminal huntingtin 
      immunohistochemistry in a consecutive series of 195 autopsy brains of individuals 
      with a positive or tentative clinical diagnosis of, or at risk for, HD. The 
      findings were correlated with striatal pathology (n = 190), CAG repeat length (n 
      = 85) and original pathological diagnosis (n = 186). The antibodies detected both 
      these inclusions in 181 patients with HD pathology > or = Vonsattel et al's grade 
      I, five patients lacking striatal tissue for review, and two at-risk individuals 
      with grade 0 and grade I HD pathology, respectively. One patient with HD-like 
      pathology and two patients and four at-risk individuals without HD pathology 
      lacked HD inclusions. In the genetically analyzed cases, the inclusions were 
      exclusively and consistently observed in association with repeat expansion 
      [(CAG)(n) > or = 39, n = 81]. Thirteen inclusion-positive cases, including the 
      grade 0 at-risk individual, had a false negative original pathological diagnosis 
      of HD and four had an unjustly questionable diagnosis. A false positive diagnosis 
      was made in the inclusion-negative case with HD-like pathology. These results 
      indicate that immunohistochemical analysis for HD inclusions facilitates the 
      pathological evaluation of HD and enhances its accuracy.

TI  - Decreased VIP and VPAC2 receptor expression in the biological clock of the R6/2 
      Huntington's disease mouse.
PG  - 139-48
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      a CAG triplet repeat expansion in the gene encoding the protein huntingtin. The 
      most studied model of HD, the R6/2 transgenic mouse, replicates many features of 
      the disease. In addition to motor, cognitive, and endocrine dysfunctions, these 
      mice exhibit a progressive disruption of circadian rhythms. This is accompanied 
      by an altered expression of the circadian clock genes in the suprachiasmatic 
      nucleus/nuclei (SCN), the principal circadian pacemaker in the brain. The 
      neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and its receptor VPAC2 are 
      highly expressed in the SCN, and VIPergic signaling plays an essential role in 
      maintenance of ongoing circadian rhythmicity. We found a marked reduction in both 
      VIP mRNA and VPAC2 receptor mRNA, quantified by RT-PCR, as well as a decrease in 
      VIP immunostaining in the SCN of R6/2 mice. These changes were coupled to a 
      disruption of circadian rhythm. We observed no loss of neurons in the SCN and 
      therefore suggest that the changes in VIP and VPAC2 receptor are due to their 
      decreased expression. In conclusion, we propose that impaired VIPergic signaling 
      is an additional candidate mechanism for disruption of circadian rhythms in R6/2 
      mice.

TI  - Sex and genetic associations with cerebrospinal fluid dopamine and metabolite 
      production after severe traumatic brain injury.
PG  - 538-47
AB  - OBJECT: Dopamine (DA) pathways have been implicated in cognitive deficits after 
      traumatic brain injury (TBI). Both sex and the dopamine transporter (DAT) 3' 
      variable number of tandem repeat polymorphism have been associated with 
      differences in DAT protein density, and DAT protein affects both presynaptic DA 
      release, through reverse transport, and DA reuptake. Catecholamines and 
      associated metabolites are subject to autooxidation, resulting in the formation 
      of reactive oxygen species that may contribute to subsequent oxidative injury. 
      The purpose of this study was to determine associations between factors that 
      affect DAT expression and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) DA and metabolite levels 
      after severe TBI. METHODS: Sixty-three patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma 
      Scale score < or = 8) were evaluated. The patients' genotypes were obtained using 
      previously banked samples of CSF, and serial CSF samples (416 samples) were used 
      to evaluate DA and metabolite levels. High-performance liquid chromatography was 
      used to determine CSF levels of DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and 
      homovanillic acid (HVA) during the first 5 days after injury. Mixed-effects 
      multivariate regression modeling revealed that patients with the DAT 10/10 
      genotype had higher CSF DA levels than patients with either the DAT 9/9 or DAT 
      9/10 genotypes (p = 0.009). Females with the DAT 10/10 genotype had higher CSF DA 
      levels than females with the DAT 9/9 or DAT 9/10 genotypes, and sex was 
      associated with higher DOPAC levels (p = 0.004). Inotrope administration also 
      contributed to higher DA levels (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to systemic 
      administration of DA, inherent factors such as sex and DAT genotype affect 
      post-TBI CSF DA and DA metabolite levels, a phenomenon that may modulate 
      susceptibility to DA-mediated oxidative injury.

TI  - CGG repeat length correlates with age of onset of motor signs of the fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).
PG  - 566-9
AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset neurological 
      disorder among carriers of premutation CGG-repeat expansions within the FMR1 
      gene. Principal features of FXTAS include progressive action tremor and gait 
      ataxia, with associated features of parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy, 
      dysautonomia, and cognitive decline. Although both clinical and neuropathologic 
      features of FXTAS are known to be highly associated with CGG repeat length, the 
      relationship between repeat length and age-of-onset is not known. To address this 
      issue, the ages of onset of action tremor and gait ataxia were documented by 
      history for 93 male carriers. For this cohort, the mean ages of onset were 62.6 
      +/- 8.1 years (range, 39-78 years) for tremor, and 63.6 +/- 7.3 years (range, 
      47-78 years) for ataxia; the mean CGG repeat number was 88.5 +/- 14 (range, 
      60-133). Analysis of the relationship between clinical onset and molecular 
      measures revealed significant correlations between CGG repeat number and onset of 
      both tremor (P = 0.001) and ataxia (P = 0.002), as well as overall onset (P < 
      0.0001). Our findings indicate that the CGG repeat number is a potential 
      predictor of the age of onset of core motor features of FXTAS.

TI  - Haploinsufficiency of yeast FEN1 causes instability of expanded CAG/CTG tracts in 
      a length-dependent manner.
PG  - 110-5
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat diseases, such as Huntington's disease, are caused by the 
      expansion of trinucleotide repeats above a threshold of about 35 repeats. Once 
      expanded, the repeats are unstable and tend to expand further both in somatic 
      cells and during transmission, resulting in a more severe disease phenotype. Flap 
      endonuclease 1 (Fen1), has an endonuclease activity specific for 5' flap 
      structures and is involved in Okazaki fragment processing and base excision 
      repair. Fen1 also plays an important role in preventing instability of CAG/CTG 
      trinucleotide repeat sequences, as the expansion frequency of CAG/CTG repeats is 
      increased in FEN1 mutants in vitro and in yeast cells defective for the yeast 
      homolog, RAD27. Here we have tested whether one copy of yeast FEN1 is enough to 
      maintain CAG/CTG tract stability in diploid yeast cells. We found that CAG/CTG 
      repeats are stable in RAD27 +/- cells if the tract is 70 repeats long and exhibit 
      a slightly increased expansion frequency if the tract is 85 or 130 repeats long. 
      However for CAG-155 tracts, the repeat expansion frequency in RAD27 +/- cells is 
      significantly higher than in RAD27 +/+ cells. This data indicates that cells 
      containing longer CAG/CTG repeats need more Fen1 protein to maintain tract 
      stability and that maintenance of long CAG/CTG repeats is particularly sensitive 
      to Fen1 levels. Our results may explain the relatively small effects seen in the 
      Huntington's disease (HD) FEN1 +/- heterozygous mice and myotonic dystrophy type 
      1 (DM1) FEN1 +/- heterozygous mice, and suggest that inefficient flap processing 
      by Fen1 could play a role in the continued expansions seen in humans with 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases.

TI  - Extended polyglutamine repeats trigger a feedback loop involving the 
      mitochondrial complex III, the proteasome and huntingtin aggregates.
PG  - 783-97
AB  - Mitochondrial abnormalities represent a major cytopathology in Huntington's 
      disease (HD), a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by CAG repeat expansions 
      in the gene encoding huntingtin (Htt). In the present study, we investigated 
      whether defects in the mitochondrial respiratory function are consequences of the 
      expression of mutant Htt or they promote the formation of Htt aggregates. To take 
      advantage of existing mitochondrial DNA mutants, we developed human osteosarcoma 
      143B cells expressing mutant Htt in an inducible manner and found that cells 
      expressing mutant Htt but not wild-type Htt exhibited a reduced activity of 
      complex III and an increased activity of complex IV. Conversely, pharmacological 
      treatments that inhibited complex III activity significantly promoted the 
      formation of Htt aggregates. This complex III-mediated modulation of Htt 
      aggregates was also observed in a neuronal progenitor RN33B cell line transduced 
      by lentivirus carrying mutant Htt. This effect of complex III inhibition on the 
      Htt aggregates appeared to be mediated by the inhibition of proteasome activity, 
      but not by ATP depletion or production of reactive oxygen species. Accordingly, 
      complex III mutant cells also showed decreased proteasome activity. These results 
      suggest the presence of a feedback system connecting the mitochondrial 
      respiratory complex III and the production of Htt aggregates. Our results suggest 
      that therapeutic interventions targeting complex III and/or proteasome could 
      ameliorate the progress of HD.

TI  - Abnormal cortical synaptic plasticity in a mouse model of Huntington's disease.
PG  - 103-7
AB  - Huntington's disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterised by a 
      progressive motor, psychiatric and cognitive decline and associated with a marked 
      loss of neurons in the cortex and striatum of affected individuals. The disease 
      is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is caused by a trinucleotide 
      (CAG) repeat expansion in the gene encoding the protein huntingtin. Predictive 
      genetic testing has revealed early cognitive deficits in asymptomatic gene 
      carriers such as altered working memory, executive function and recognition 
      memory. The perirhinal cortex is believed to process aspects of recognition 
      memory. Evidence from primate studies suggests that decrements in neuronal firing 
      within this cortical region encode recognition memory and that the underlying 
      mechanism is an activity-dependent long-term depression (LTD) of excitatory 
      neurotransmission, the converse of long-term potentiation (LTP). We have used the 
      R6/1 mouse model of HD to assess synaptic plasticity in the perirhinal cortex. 
      This mouse model provides an ideal tool for investigating early and progressive 
      changes in synaptic function in HD. We report here that LTD at perirhinal 
      synapses is markedly reduced in R6/1 mice. We also provide evidence to suggest 
      that a reduction in dopamine D2 receptor signalling may be implicated.

TI  - The Hdh(Q150/Q150) knock-in mouse model of HD and the R6/2 exon 1 model develop 
      comparable and widespread molecular phenotypes.
PG  - 83-97
AB  - The identification of the Huntington's disease (HD) mutation as a 
      CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion enabled the generation of transgenic rodent 
      models and gene-targeted mouse models of HD. Of these, mice that are transgenic 
      for an N-terminal huntingtin fragment have been used most extensively because 
      they develop phenotypes with relatively early ages of onset and rapid disease 
      progression. Although the fragment models have led to novel insights into the 
      pathophysiology of HD, it is important that models expressing a mutant version of 
      the full-length protein are analysed in parallel. We have generated congenic 
      C57BL/6 and CBA strains for the HdhQ150 knock-in mouse model of HD so that 
      homozygotes can be analysed on an F1 hybrid background. Although a significant 
      impairment in grip strength could be detected from a very early age, the 
      performance of these mice in the quantitative behavioural tests most frequently 
      used in preclinical efficacy trials indicates that they are unlikely to be useful 
      for preclinical screening using a battery of conventional tests. However, at 22 
      months of age, the Hdh(Q150/Q150) homozygotes showed unexpected widespread 
      aggregate deposition throughout the brain, transcriptional dysregulation in the 
      striatum and cerebellum and decreased levels of specific chaperones, all 
      well-characterised molecular phenotypes present in R6/2 mice aged 12 weeks. 
      Therefore, when strain background and CAG repeat length are controlled for, the 
      knock-in and fragment models develop comparable phenotypes. This supports the 
      continued use of the more high-throughput fragment models to identify mechanisms 
      of pathogenesis and for preclinical screening.

TI  - Genetic criteria for Huntington's disease pathogenesis.
PG  - 78-82
AB  - Genetic analysis aims to identify the variations in DNA sequence whose functional 
      consequences produce heritable variations in phenotype. In one of the first 
      successes of unbiased molecular genetic analysis in human disease, the 
      Huntington's disease (HD) gene was mapped and cloned without any prior knowledge 
      of the nature of its protein product or of the molecular defect that underlies 
      the characteristic phenotype of the disorder. However, while the cloning of HD 
      and recognition of its trinucleotide repeat expansion spawned a plethora of 
      approaches to investigating HD through its distinctive neuropathology, the role 
      for genetic strategies in HD research did not end there. The use of genetic 
      analysis has remained a critical tool for defining the characteristics of the 
      mechanism that triggers the pathogenic process, permitting the investigation of 
      early events that occur long before traditionally recognized pathology. 
      Delineation of these events can reveal molecular targets for development of 
      therapies that prevent onset of HD. Most recently, an extension of genetic 
      analysis to the identification of non-linked genetic variations that alter the 
      course of HD pathogenesis has offered the promise of identifying modifier genes 
      to reveal biological pathways active throughout the disease process and to 
      provide valid targets for pharmacological intervention. Thus, unbiased genetic 
      strategies have not only provided a crucial entree into molecular investigation 
      of HD via a root cause that was previously unsuspected, they also represent a 
      continuing route to accelerate the ultimate goal of developing an effective 
      treatment for HD.

TI  - Monoamine metabolites level in CSF is related to the 5-HTT gene polymorphism in 
      treatment-resistant depression.
PG  - 2143-51
AB  - The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) transporter (5-HTT) is considered to affect 
      the pathogenesis of mood disorders. Large number of genetic association studies 
      between 5-HTT functional polymorphisms and vulnerability of mood disorders and 
      therapeutic response to antidepressants has been carried out. We investigated the 
      influence of 5-HTT-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and 5-HTT 17 bp variable 
      number of tandem repeat polymorphism (5-HTTVNTR) polymorphisms on concentrations 
      of monoamine metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) among treatment-resistant 
      patients with mood disorders. Subjects were 119 Swedish patients with persistent 
      mood disorders and 141 healthy subjects. In 112 of these patients, we measured 
      5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 
      3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol in CSF. Genotyping for 5-HTT polymorphisms from 
      genomic DNA was carried out by PCR. There was no significant difference in 
      allele/genotype frequency between patients and healthy subjects. In patients with 
      mood disorders, we found significant difference in mean 5-HIAA concentration 
      between 5-HTTLPR genotypes (p=0.03). Although the 5-HIAA concentration showed a 
      tendency to be higher in short (S) carriers than in non-S carriers of the 
      5-HTTLPR in patients (p=0.06), when considering patients with major depressive 
      disorder (MDD), the 5-HIAA concentration was significantly higher among S 
      carriers than among non-S carriers (p=0.02). Moreover, the 5-HIAA concentration 
      was higher in S/S subjects compared to long (L)/L (p=0.0001) and L/S (p=0.002) 
      subjects in patients with MDD. Similarly, there was higher HVA concentration in 
      S/S subjects compared to L/L (p=0.002) and L/S subjects (p=0.002). There was no 
      effect of 5-HTTVNTR. Our findings show that the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism affects 
      5-HIAA and HVA concentrations among treatment-resistant patients with mood 
      disorders.

TI  - Attitudes toward fragile X mutation carrier testing from women identified in a 
      general population survey.
PG  - 97-104
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is primarily due to a CGG repeat expansion found in the FMR1 
      X-linked gene. In a previous study, we conducted focus groups with women to 
      assess their attitudes towards fragile X carrier screening. In this follow-up 
      study, we conducted in-depth interviews of general population reproductive-age 
      women who were identified as carriers. We explored their attitudes toward testing 
      for carrier status of the fragile X mutation. These women underwent screening 
      primarily to participate in a research project rather than in search of a 
      diagnosis for specific symptoms. As such, these women were wholly unprepared for 
      positive carrier results. Their responses about their results and carrier 
      screening, in many cases, were being worked out over the course of the interview 
      itself. The most salient finding of this work is the apparent lack of relevance 
      of carrier status to these women. Many expressed that although the information 
      could be relevant in the future, it is not relevant at this stage of their lives 
      in terms of family planning (either with respect to having unaffected offspring 
      or to premature ovarian failure) and personal relationships. Although issues of 
      abortion seemed prominent in the focus groups, we found that carrier status did 
      not have an apparent effect on women's attitudes about termination. We 
      hypothesize this may be related to the fact that women had not processed their 
      new carrier status and had not related it to previously-formed personal opinions. 
      The findings of this work have significant implications for genetic counseling 
      and population screening. Genetic counselors should be mindful that general 
      population women may not recognize the immediate importance of their carrier 
      status even when literature is provided and discussed prior to providing a 
      sample. As part of comprehensive genetic counseling, counselors should identify 
      the reproductive life stage of the woman receiving the new information and help 
      her identify when this information would be more meaningful in her life. 
      Counselors can assist in setting up a personalized road map with specific types 
      of services that will be more applicable to the woman as her carrier status 
      becomes more relevant.

TI  - Inherited CAG.CTG allele length is a major modifier of somatic mutation length 
      variability in Huntington disease.
PG  - 789-96
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is associated with an unstable trinucleotide CAG.CTG 
      repeat expansion. Although the repeat length is inversely correlated with the 
      age-at-onset of symptoms, variability between patients who have inherited the 
      same HD repeat length clearly suggests that other factors influence this aspect 
      of the disease. As repeat length profiles in somatic tissues suggest that repeat 
      length gains may contribute to both the tissue-specificity and progressive nature 
      of HD pathogenesis, genetic modifiers of mutation length variability may 
      therefore influence the age-at-onset of the disease. Using a sensitive single 
      molecule-PCR assay we show that HD mutation length profiles in buccal cell DNA 
      vary from individual to individual. The resulting data provide the first 
      quantitative evidence that inherited CAG.CTG repeat length has a major influence 
      on somatic CAG.CTG repeat length variation. In addition, we confirm that further 
      environmental and/or genetic modifiers of repeat length variation exist and 
      discuss the implications that our results may have on understanding the factors 
      that influence severity and age-at-onset of Huntington disease symptoms.

PG  - 107-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: A 76-year-old man presented with an 8-year history of balance 
      problems and a 2-year history of short-term memory loss. He had also been 
      experiencing long-term problems with impotence and episodes of urinary 
      incontinence, and had been managed for hypertension for 25 years. His medical 
      history was otherwise unremarkable. Three of his grandchildren had been diagnosed 
      with fragile X syndrome. INVESTIGATIONS: Neurological examination, cognitive and 
      neuropsychological testing, nerve conduction studies, MRI, and genetic testing. 
      DIAGNOSIS: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) resulting from a 
      premutation (CGG repeat) expansion of the FMR1 gene. MANAGEMENT: Explanation of 
      the genetic ramifications of premutation carrier status for the FMR1 gene, and 
      symptomatic treatment for the clinical difficulties experienced by the patient.

TI  - Impairment of executive cognitive functioning in males with fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome.
PG  - 645-50
AB  - The fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a recently identified 
      phenotype associated with trinucleotide repeat expansions in the premutation 
      range of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. In addition to 
      progressive gait ataxia, action tremor, peripheral neuropathy, and parkinsonism, 
      FXTAS involves impaired cognition. Our preliminary research suggests that 
      executive cognitive functioning (ECF) is especially affected. In this study, a 
      brief neuropsychological exam was administered to 33 men with FXTAS and 27 
      healthy controls. Compared with controls, individuals with FXTAS showed 
      statistically significant impairments on measures from the Wechsler Adult 
      Intelligence Scale, third edition (WAIS-III; verbal IQ, performance [nonverbal] 
      IQ, verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, and processing speed). FXTAS 
      subjects scored significantly lower on three of four measures of ECF and on two 
      tests of information processing speed. The results provide evidence that FXTAS 
      involves impairment of general intellectual functioning, with marked impairment 
      of executive cognitive abilities. The pattern of cognitive performance is 
      somewhat similar to that observed in the frontal variant of frontotemporal 
      dementia and several of the spinocerebellar ataxias, but differs from the 
      deficits observed in dementia of the Alzheimer type.

TI  - Error processing in Huntington's disease.
PG  - e86
LID - e86
AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic disorder expressed by a 
      degeneration of the basal ganglia inter alia accompanied with dopaminergic 
      alterations. These dopaminergic alterations are related to genetic factors i.e., 
      CAG-repeat expansion. The error (related) negativity (Ne/ERN), a cognitive 
      event-related potential related to performance monitoring, is generated in the 
      anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and supposed to depend on the dopaminergic 
      system. The Ne is reduced in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Due to a dopaminergic 
      deficit in HD, a reduction of the Ne is also likely. Furthermore it is assumed 
      that movement dysfunction emerges as a consequence of dysfunctional 
      error-feedback processing. Since dopaminergic alterations are related to the 
      CAG-repeat, a Ne reduction may furthermore also be related to the genetic disease 
      load. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: We assessed the error negativity (Ne) in a 
      speeded reaction task under consideration of the underlying genetic 
      abnormalities. HD patients showed a specific reduction in the Ne, which suggests 
      impaired error processing in these patients. Furthermore, the Ne was closely 
      related to CAG-repeat expansion. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The reduction of the 
      Ne is likely to be an effect of the dopaminergic pathology. The result resembles 
      findings in Parkinson's Disease. As such the Ne might be a measure for the 
      integrity of striatal dopaminergic output function. The relation to the 
      CAG-repeat expansion indicates that the Ne could serve as a gene-associated 
      "cognitive" biomarker in HD.

TI  - The relationship between CAG repeat length and age of onset differs for 
      Huntington's disease patients with juvenile onset or adult onset.
PG  - 295-301
AB  - Age of onset for Huntington's disease (HD) varies inversely with the length of 
      the disease-causing CAG repeat expansion in the HD gene. A simple exponential 
      regression model yielded adjusted R-squared values of 0.728 in a large set of 
      Venezuelan kindreds and 0.642 in a North American, European, and Australian 
      sample (the HD MAPS cohort). We present evidence that a two-segment exponential 
      regression curve provides a significantly better fit than the simple exponential 
      regression. A plot of natural log-transformed age of onset against CAG repeat 
      length reveals this segmental relationship. This two-segment exponential 
      regression on age of onset data increases the adjusted R-squared values by 0.012 
      in the Venezuelan kindreds and by 0.035 in the HD MAPS cohort. Although the 
      amount of additional variance explained by the segmental regression approach is 
      modest, the two slopes of the two-segment regression are significantly different 
      from each other in both the Venezuelan kindreds [F(2, 439) = 11.13, P= 2 x 
      10(-5)] and in the HD MAPS cohort [F(2, 688) = 38.27, P= 2 x 10(-16)]. In both 
      populations, the influence of each CAG repeat on age of onset appears to be 
      stronger in the adult-onset range of CAG repeats than in the juvenile-onset 
      range.

TI  - Association between obsessive-compulsive disorder and a variable number of tandem 
      repeats polymorphism in intron 2 of the serotonin transporter gene.
PG  - 416-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacological studies indicate a dysregulation of the serotonergic 
      system in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). A variable number tandem repeats 
      (VNTR) polymorphism with three alleles (Stin2.9, Stin2.10, Stin2.12) has been 
      described in intron 2 of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene. This 
      polymorphism has been associated with unipolar depression, bipolar disorder, 
      schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders including OCD. METHODS: The association 
      between OCD and the polymorphism is examined in 97 OCD patients, 578 psychiatric 
      controls and 406 healthy controls, all Spanish Caucasians. RESULTS: Genotype 
      frequencies for the polymorphism were significantly different in OCD patients, 
      psychiatric patients and controls. There was a significant excess of 12/12 and 
      12/10 genotypes in OCD patients compared to psychiatric patients and controls. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a possible association between the Stin2.12 
      allele of the VNTR polymorphism and OCD.

TI  - 5-HTTLPR Genotype-Specific Phenotype in Children and Adolescents With Autism.
PG  - 2148-56
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) is a strong autism candidate 
      gene because of its association with anxiety, aggression and attention, and the 
      effectiveness of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in treating 
      certain behavioral symptoms. In families with individuals with autism, several 
      reports of biased transmission of both alleles (short, long) at the serotonin 
      transporter gene promotor polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) locus of SLC6A4 now exist. The 
      heterogeneity in these reports may be due to clinical heterogeneity. The authors 
      hypothesized that 5-HTTLPR genotypes would be related to variation in specific 
      symptoms in children with autism. METHOD: The authors explored whether variants 
      of two functional polymorphisms of SLC6A4 (5-HTTLPR, intron 2 variable number 
      tandem repeat [2 VNTR]) were related to behavioral characteristics measured by 
      the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation 
      Schedule. Subjects (N=73, age 3-19 years old) met diagnostic criteria for 
      autistic disorder based on both measures. RESULTS: Evidence of genotype-phenotype 
      interactions on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised was found with the 
      5-HTTLPR short group of HTTLPR (S/L or S/S genotypes) being rated as more severe 
      on the subdomain "failure to use nonverbal communication to regulate social 
      interaction," and the long group (L/L genotype) being more severe on the 
      subdomain "stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms" and on an aggression 
      measure. In contrast, on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, the long 
      group was associated with greater severity on directed facial expressions and 
      unusual sensory interests. There were no significant relationships between the 
      intron 2 VNTR genotypes and subdomains or domains of symptoms on the Autism 
      Diagnostic Interview-Revised or the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide initial support for genotype-specific 
      phenotypes for 5-HTTLPR in autism based on ratings from the Autism Diagnostic 
      Interview-Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule.

      syndrome.
PG  - 1426-31
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess changes in regional brain volumes associated with the 
      fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and the molecular correlates 
      of these changes. METHODS: We administered molecular, MRI, and neurocognitive 
      tests to 36 male premutation carriers (ages 51 to 79), 25 affected and 11 
      unaffected with FXTAS, and to 21 control subjects of similar age and education. 
      RESULTS: We found differences among the three groups in whole brain, cerebrum, 
      cerebellum, ventricular volume, and whole-brain white matter hyperintensity, with 
      the affected group showing significantly more pathology than the control and 
      unaffected groups. Brainstem volume was significantly smaller in the unaffected 
      group vs controls but did not differ from the affected group. Within the 
      premutation sample, CGG repeat length correlated with reductions in IQ and 
      cerebellar volume and increased ventricular volume and whole-brain white matter 
      hyperintensity. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings, coupled with recent evidence 
      linking the degree of neuropathology (numbers of intranuclear inclusions) to the 
      size of the premutation allele, provide evidence that the neurodegenerative 
      phenotype in the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome is a consequence of 
      the CGG repeat expansion.

TI  - Thermoregulatory and metabolic defects in Huntington's disease transgenic mice 
      implicate PGC-1alpha in Huntington's disease neurodegeneration.
PG  - 349-62
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal, dominantly inherited disorder caused by 
      polyglutamine repeat expansion in the huntingtin (htt) gene. Here, we observe 
      that HD mice develop hypothermia associated with impaired activation of brown 
      adipose tissue (BAT). Although sympathetic stimulation of PPARgamma coactivator 
      1alpha (PGC-1alpha) was intact in BAT of HD mice, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) 
      induction was blunted. In cultured cells, expression of mutant htt suppressed 
      UCP-1 promoter activity; this was reversed by PGC-1alpha expression. HD mice 
      showed reduced food intake and increased energy expenditure, with dysfunctional 
      BAT mitochondria. PGC-1alpha is a known regulator of mitochondrial function; 
      here, we document reduced expression of PGC-1alpha target genes in HD patient and 
      mouse striatum. Mitochondria of HD mouse brain show reduced oxygen consumption 
      rates. Finally, HD striatal neurons expressing exogenous PGC-1alpha were 
      resistant to 3-nitropropionic acid treatment. Altered PGC-1alpha function may 
      thus link transcription dysregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction in HD.

TI  - Transcriptional repression of PGC-1alpha by mutant huntingtin leads to 
      mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration.
PG  - 59-69
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
      glutamine repeat expansion in huntingtin protein. Transcriptional deregulation 
      and altered energy metabolism have been implicated in HD pathogenesis. We report 
      here that mutant huntingtin causes disruption of mitochondrial function by 
      inhibiting expression of PGC-1alpha, a transcriptional coactivator that regulates 
      several metabolic processes, including mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration. 
      Mutant huntingtin represses PGC-1alpha gene transcription by associating with the 
      promoter and interfering with the CREB/TAF4-dependent transcriptional pathway 
      critical for the regulation of PGC-1alpha gene expression. Crossbreeding of 
      PGC-1alpha knockout (KO) mice with HD knockin (KI) mice leads to increased 
      neurodegeneration of striatal neurons and motor abnormalities in the HD mice. 
      Importantly, expression of PGC-1alpha partially reverses the toxic effects of 
      mutant huntingtin in cultured striatal neurons. Moreover, lentiviral-mediated 
      delivery of PGC-1alpha in the striatum provides neuroprotection in the transgenic 
      HD mice. These studies suggest a key role for PGC-1alpha in the control of energy 
      metabolism in the early stages of HD pathogenesis.

TI  - Cholinergic neuronal defect without cell loss in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 3119-31
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG-repeat 
      expansion in the huntingtin (IT15) gene. The striatum is one of the regions most 
      affected by neurodegeneration, resulting in the loss of the medium-sized spiny 
      neurons. Traditionally, the large cholinergic striatal interneurons are believed 
      to be spared. Recent studies demonstrate that neuronal dysfunction without cell 
      death also plays an important role in early and mid-stages of the disease. Here, 
      we report that cholinergic transmission is affected in a HD transgenic mouse 
      model (R6/1) and in tissues from HD patients. Stereological analysis shows no 
      loss of cholinergic neurons in the striatum or septum in R6/1 mice. In contrast, 
      the levels of mRNA and protein for vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) 
      and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) are decreased in the striatum and cortex, 
      and acetylcholine esterase activity is lowered in the striatum of R6/1 mice 
      already at young ages. Accordingly, VAChT is also reduced in striatal tissue from 
      patients with HD. The decrease of VAChT in the patient samples studied is 
      restricted to the striatum and does not occur in the hippocampus or the spinal 
      cord. The expression and localization of REST/NRSF, a transcriptional regulator 
      for the VAChT and ChAT genes, are not altered in cholinergic neurons. We show 
      that the R6/1 mice exhibit severe deficits in learning and reference memory. 
      Taken together, our data show that the cholinergic system is dysfunctional in 
      R6/1 and HD patients. Consequently, they provide a rationale for testing of 
      pro-cholinergic drugs in this disease.

TI  - Genome-wide significance for a modifier of age at neurological onset in 
      Huntington's disease at 6q23-24: the HD MAPS study.
PG  - 71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Age at onset of Huntington's disease (HD) is correlated with the size 
      of the abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the HD gene; however, several studies 
      have indicated that other genetic factors also contribute to the variability in 
      HD age at onset. To identify modifier genes, we recently reported a whole-genome 
      scan in a sample of 629 affected sibling pairs from 295 pedigrees, in which six 
      genomic regions provided suggestive evidence for quantitative trait loci (QTL), 
      modifying age at onset in HD. METHODS: In order to test the replication of this 
      finding, eighteen microsatellite markers, three from each of the six genomic 
      regions, were genotyped in 102 newly recruited sibling pairs from 69 pedigrees, 
      and data were analyzed, using a multipoint linkage variance component method, in 
      the follow-up sample and the combined sample of 352 pedigrees with 753 sibling 
      pairs. RESULTS: Suggestive evidence for linkage at 6q23-24 in the follow-up 
      sample (LOD = 1.87, p = 0.002) increased to genome-wide significance for linkage 
      in the combined sample (LOD = 4.05, p = 0.00001), while suggestive evidence for 
      linkage was observed at 18q22, in both the follow-up sample (LOD = 0.79, p = 
      0.03) and the combined sample (LOD = 1.78, p = 0.002). Epistatic analysis 
      indicated that there is no interaction between 6q23-24 and other loci. 
      CONCLUSION: In this replication study, linkage for modifier of age at onset in HD 
      was confirmed at 6q23-24. Evidence for linkage was also found at 18q22. The 
      demonstration of statistically significant linkage to a potential modifier locus 
      opens the path to location cloning of a gene capable of altering HD pathogenesis, 
      which could provide a validated target for therapeutic development in the human 
      patient.

TI  - Exclusion of mutations in the PRNP, JPH3, TBP, ATN1, CREBBP, POU3F2 and FTL genes 
      as a cause of disease in Portuguese patients with a Huntington-like phenotype.
PG  - 645-651
LID - 10.1007/s10038-006-0001-9 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterised by chorea, cognitive impairment, dementia and personality changes, 
      caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the HD gene. Often, patients with a 
      similar clinical presentation do not carry expansions of the CAG repeat in this 
      gene [Huntington disease-like (HDL) patients]. We report the genetic analysis of 
      107 Portuguese patients with an HDL phenotype. The HDL genes PRNP and JPH3, 
      encoding the prion protein and junctophilin-3, respectively, were screened for 
      repeat expansions in these patients. Given the partial clinical overlap of SCA17, 
      DRPLA and neuroferritinopathy with HD, their causative genes (TBP, ATN1, and FTL, 
      respectively) were also analysed. Finally, repeat expansions in two candidate 
      genes, CREBBP and POU3F2, which encode the nuclear transcriptional coactivator 
      CREB-binding protein and the CNS-specific transcription factor N-Oct-3, 
      respectively, were also studied. Expansions of the repetitive tracts of the PRNP, 
      JPH3, TBP, ATN1, CREBBP and POU3F2 genes were excluded in all patients, as were 
      sequence alterations in the FTL gene. Since none of the genes already included in 
      the differential diagnosis of HD was responsible for the disease in our sample, 
      the genetic heterogeneity of the HDL phenotype is still open for investigation.

      tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).
PG  - 227-33
AB  - Disorders associated with fragile X syndrome involve a trinucleotide (CGG) repeat 
      expansion in the FMR1 gene. Recently, a progressive movement disorder (fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome [FXTAS]) has been identified in premutation 
      carriers, persons with 55 to 200 CGG repeats. In addition to ataxia, action 
      tremor, and Parkinsonism, early case reports suggested that FXTAS involves 
      impaired cognition, but the precise nature of the impairment has not been 
      elucidated. In this first, preliminary study of the subject, circumscribed 
      aspects of cognitive functioning were examined in 25 men with FXTAS. Subjects' 
      performance on the cognitive tests was compared with normative data. Scores on 
      two measures of executive cognitive functioning showed a high prevalence of 
      substantial impairment. Capacity for inhibition was severely affected in 
      one-quarter of this highly educated sample; information processing speed was 
      profoundly impaired in most subjects. Although mean verbal and performance IQ 
      scores were not significantly different from the general population, they were 
      quite low given the sample's educational level. Cognitive and functional 
      impairment was greater for men with more CGG repeats, although number of repeats 
      was not associated with age of onset of either tremor or ataxia. The results 
      provide evidence that FXTAS involves marked impairment of executive cognitive 
      abilities.

TI  - Loss of endogenous androgen receptor protein accelerates motor neuron 
      degeneration and accentuates androgen insensitivity in a mouse model of X-linked 
      spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 2225-38
AB  - X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA; Kennedy's disease) is a 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) disease in which the affected males suffer progressive 
      motor neuron degeneration accompanied by signs of androgen insensitivity, such as 
      gynecomastia and reduced fertility. SBMA is caused by CAG repeat expansions in 
      the androgen receptor (AR) gene resulting in the production of AR protein with an 
      extended glutamine tract. SBMA is one of nine polyQ diseases in which polyQ 
      expansion is believed to impart a toxic gain-of-function effect upon the mutant 
      protein, and initiate a cascade of events that culminate in neurodegeneration. 
      However, whether loss of a disease protein's normal function concomitantly 
      contributes to the neurodegeneration remains unanswered. To address this, we 
      examined the role of normal AR function in SBMA by crossing a highly 
      representative AR YAC transgenic mouse model with 100 glutamines (AR100) and a 
      corresponding control (AR20) onto an AR null (testicular feminization; Tfm) 
      background. Absence of endogenous AR protein in AR100Tfm mice had profound 
      effects upon neuromuscular and endocrine-reproductive features of this SBMA mouse 
      model, as AR100Tfm mice displayed accelerated neurodegeneration and severe 
      androgen insensitivity in comparison to AR100 littermates. Reduction in size and 
      number of androgen-sensitive motor neurons in the spinal cord of AR100Tfm mice 
      underscored the importance of AR action for neuronal health and survival. 
      Promoter-reporter assays confirmed that AR transactivation competence diminishes 
      in a polyQ length-dependent fashion. Our studies indicate that SBMA disease 
      pathogenesis, both in the nervous system and the periphery, involves two 
      simultaneous pathways: gain-of-function misfolded protein toxicity and loss of 
      normal protein function.

TI  - Viral delivery of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor improves behavior 
      and protects striatal neurons in a mouse model of Huntington's disease.
PG  - 9345-50
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal, genetic, neurological disorder resulting 
      from a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the gene that encodes for the protein 
      huntingtin. These excessive repeats confer a toxic gain of function on 
      huntingtin, which leads to the degeneration of striatal and cortical neurons and 
      a devastating motor, cognitive, and psychological disorder. Trophic factor 
      administration has emerged as a compelling potential therapy for a variety of 
      neurodegenerative disorders, including HD. We previously demonstrated that viral 
      delivery of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) provides 
      structural and functional neuroprotection in a rat neurotoxin model of HD. In 
      this report we demonstrate that viral delivery of GDNF into the striatum of 
      presymptomatic mice ameliorates behavioral deficits on the accelerating rotorod 
      and hind limb clasping tests in transgenic HD mice. Behavioral neuroprotection 
      was associated with anatomical preservation of the number and size of striatal 
      neurons from cell death and cell atrophy. Additionally, GDNF-treated mice had a 
      lower percentage of neurons containing mutant huntingtin-stained inclusion 
      bodies, a hallmark of HD pathology. These data further support the concept that 
      viral vector delivery of GDNF may be a viable treatment for patients suffering 
      from HD.

TI  - Association between serotonin transporter gene and borderline personality 
      disorder.
PG  - 448-53
AB  - Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by a pervasive pattern of 
      instability in regulation of emotion, interpersonal relationships, self-image, 
      and impulse control beginning in early adulthood. BPD affects about 1-2% of the 
      general population and has a high mortality rate as a result of suicide and 
      impulsive behaviour. The serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT) is considered as a 
      candidate gene for BPD as multiple lines of evidence have suggested that it plays 
      an important role in suicide, impulsive behaviour, and emotional liability. To 
      test for an association between 5-HTT and BPD, we genotyped three common 
      polymorphisms: the serotonin transporter linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR); a 
      variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) in intron 2, and a single nucleotide 
      variant (A/G) within the LPR region. Eighty-nine Caucasian patients with BPD and 
      269 Caucasian healthy controls were analyzed. The program UNPHASED was used to 
      compare allele and haplotype frequencies between cases and controls. Significant 
      differences in allele frequencies of the VNTR marker (p=0.012) and haplotype 
      frequencies (p=0.002) between patients and controls were found. Compared with 
      healthy controls, patients with BPD showed higher frequencies of the 10 repeat of 
      the VNTR marker and the S-10 haplotype, and lower 12 repeat and L(A)-12 
      haplotype. Our results suggest that the serotonin transporter gene may play a 
      role in the aetiology of borderline personality disorder.

TI  - Genetic background modifies nuclear mutant huntingtin accumulation and HD CAG 
      repeat instability in Huntington's disease knock-in mice.
PG  - 2015-24
AB  - Genetically precise models of Huntington's disease (HD), Hdh CAG knock-in mice, 
      are powerful systems in which phenotypes associated with expanded HD CAG repeats 
      are studied. To dissect the genetic pathways that underlie such phenotypes, we 
      have generated Hdh(Q111) knock-in mouse lines that are congenic for C57BL/6, 
      FVB/N and 129Sv inbred genetic backgrounds and investigated four Hdh(Q111) 
      phenotypes in these three genetic backgrounds: the intergenerational instability 
      of the HD CAG repeat and the striatal-specific somatic HD CAG repeat expansion, 
      nuclear mutant huntingtin accumulation and intranuclear inclusion formation. Our 
      results reveal increased intergenerational and somatic instability of the HD CAG 
      repeat in C57BL/6 and FVB/N backgrounds compared with the 129Sv background. The 
      accumulation of nuclear mutant huntingtin and the formation of intranuclear 
      inclusions were fastest in the C57BL/6 background, slowest in the 129Sv 
      background and intermediate in the FVB/N background. Inbred strain-specific 
      differences were independent of constitutive HD CAG repeat size and did not 
      correlate with Hdh mRNA levels. These data provide evidence for genetic modifiers 
      of both intergenerational HD CAG repeat instability and striatal-specific 
      phenotypes. Different relative contributions of C57BL/6 and 129Sv genetic 
      backgrounds to the onset of nuclear mutant huntingtin and somatic HD CAG repeat 
      expansion predict that the initiation of each of these two phenotypes is modified 
      by different genes. Our findings set the stage for defining disease-related 
      genetic pathways that will ultimately provide insight into disease mechanism.

TI  - DNA microarray analysis of striatal gene expression in symptomatic transgenic 
      Huntington's mice (R6/2) reveals neuroinflammation and insulin associations.
PG  - 176-86
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited, progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by CAG repeat expansion in the gene that codes for the protein huntingtin. 
      The underlying neuropathological events leading to the selectivity of striatal 
      neuronal loss are unknown. However, the huntingtin mutation interferes at several 
      levels of normal cell function. The complexity of this disease makes microarray 
      analysis an appealing technique to begin the identification of common pathways 
      that may contribute to the pathology. In this study, striatal tissue was 
      extracted for gene expression profiling from wild-type and symptomatic transgenic 
      Huntington mice (R6/2) expressing part of the human Huntington's disease gene. We 
      interrogated a 15 K high-density mouse EST array not previously used for HD and 
      identified 170 significantly differentially expressed ESTs in symptomatic R6/2 
      mice. Of the 80 genes with known function, 9 genes had previously been identified 
      as altered in HD. 71 known genes were associated with HD for the first time. The 
      data obtained from this study confirm and extend previous observations using DNA 
      microarray techniques on genetic models for HD, revealing novel changes in 
      expression in a number of genes not previously associated with HD. Further 
      bioinformatic analysis, using software to construct biological association maps, 
      focused attention on proteins such as insulin and TH1-mediated cytokines, 
      suggesting that they may be important regulators of affected genes. These results 
      may provide insight into the regulation and interaction of genes that contribute 
      to adaptive and pathological processes involved in HD.

TI  - Early development of aberrant synaptic plasticity in a mouse model of 
      Huntington's disease.
PG  - 1690-703
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
      progressive motor, psychiatric and cognitive decline. Marked neuronal loss occurs 
      in the cortex and striatum. HD is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and 
      caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion (CAG) in the gene encoding the protein 
      huntingtin. Predictive genetic testing has revealed early cognitive deficits in 
      asymptomatic gene carriers at a time when there is little evidence for cell 
      death, suggesting that impaired cognition results from a cellular or synaptic 
      deficit, such as aberrant synaptic plasticity. Altered hippocampal long-term 
      potentiation has been reported in mouse models of HD; however, the relationship 
      between synaptic dysfunction and phenotype progression has not previously been 
      characterized. We examined the age-dependency of aberrant hippocampal synaptic 
      plasticity in the R6/1 mouse model of HD. Long-term depression (LTD) is a 
      developmentally regulated form of plasticity, which normally declines by early 
      adulthood. Young R6/1 mice follow the same pattern of LTD expression as controls, 
      in that they express LTD in the first weeks of life, and then lose the ability 
      with age. Unlike controls, R6/1 synapses later regain the ability to support LTD. 
      This is associated with nuclear localization of mutant huntingtin, but occurs 
      months prior to the formation of nuclear aggregates. We present the first 
      detailed description of a progressive derailment of a functional neural correlate 
      of cognitive processing in HD.

TI  - Normal sensitivity to excitotoxicity in a transgenic Huntington's disease rat.
PG  - 306-10
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the HD gene. Excitotoxic cell damage by excessive 
      stimulation of glutamate receptors has been hypothesized to contribute to the 
      pathogenesis of HD. Transgenic mouse models of HD have shown variable sensitivity 
      to excitotoxicity. The models differ in the genetic background, the type and 
      length of the promoter driving the transgene expression, the CAG repeat length 
      and/or the HD gene construct length. Furthermore, one has to differentiate 
      whether transgenic or knock-in models have been used. All these factors may be 
      involved in determining the responsiveness to an excitotoxic insult. Here, we 
      explored the responsiveness to excitotoxic damage using a transgenic HD rat model 
      carrying 22% of the rat HD gene which is driven by the rat HD promoter and which 
      harbors 51 CAG repeats. 3 and 18 months old transgenic HD rats and their 
      wild-type littermates received unilateral intrastriatal injections of the 
      glutamate analogue quinolinic acid. Lesion size was assessed 7 days later using 
      the degenerative stain Fluoro-Jade and by immunohistochemistry for the neuronal 
      protein NeuN. No difference in susceptibility to excitotoxicity was found between 
      the groups. Our study supports mouse data showing maintained susceptibility to 
      excitotoxicity with the expression of around 25% of the full HD gene. Differences 
      in sensitivity to excitotoxicity between genetic animal models of HD may be 
      dependent on the length of the expressed HD gene although additional factors are 
      also likely to be important.

TI  - Serotonin transporter polymorphisms and side effects in antidepressant therapy--a 
      pilot study.
PG  - 159-66
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the influence of the serotonin transporter variable number 
      of tandem repeat (HTT-VNTR) polymorphism and the serotonin 
      transporter-gene-linked polymorphic region (HTTLPR) polymorphism on development 
      of side effects under antidepressant therapy. METHODS: A total of 109 depressive 
      in-patients treated with various antidepressants according to local clinical 
      practice were included in the investigation. Four weeks after admission to 
      hospital, side effects were assessed by using a modified version of the dosage 
      record and treatment emergent symptoms scale (DOTES). Differences in side effects 
      between the genotype groups of both polymorphisms were analyzed using the 
      Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: A total of 65 patients received mirtazapine (25 of 
      them in combination with other antidepressants), and 44 patients were 
      predominantly treated with antidepressants acting via HTT, such as selective 
      serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). When 
      patients were treated with HTT-blocking antidepressants, a significantly higher 
      occurrence of side effects in patients with the HTTVNTR 2.10/2.10 genotype 
      (52.6%) than in patients with the 2.10/2.12 (12.5%) and 2.12/2.12 (0%) genotypes 
      (p = 0.004) was found. With regard to the HTTLPR polymorphism, patients 
      predominantly on HTT-blocking antidepressants with the s/s genotype suffered more 
      frequently from side effects (50.0%) than heterozygotes (40.0%) and homozygotes 
      for the l-allele (0%) (p = 0.002). In contrast, no association of the HTTVNTR 
      polymorphism was found in patients treated with mirtazapine. The risk groups 
      defined by a combined genotype from both polymorphisms demonstrated a major 
      effect on the incidence of adverse drug events in patients treated with 
      predominantly HTT-blocking antidepressants (p = 0.00018; low risk: 0%, 0/13, 
      medium risk: 13.3%, 2/15, high risk: 62.5%, 10/16). CONCLUSION: These results 
      support the hypothesis that both polymorphisms influence tolerability to drugs 
      primarily acting via HTT inhibition, such as SSRIs, TCAs and venlafaxine. 
      Tolerability to mirtazapine was not influenced, probably owing to a different 
      mode of action. As there are limitations due to the heterogeneity of treatment 
      and concomitant therapy, further studies are required to confirm the obtained 
      results.

TI  - Serotonin transporter linked promoter (polymorphism) in the serotonin transporter 
      gene may be associated with antidepressant-induced mania in bipolar disorder.
PG  - 25-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several pharmacogenetic studies suggest that response to 
      pharmacotherapy in bipolar disorder may be mediated by genetic factors. The aim 
      of this study was to investigate further the association of the genetic 
      variations of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene with antidepressant-induced 
      mania, already reported in recent studies. We also studied the possible 
      association of these genetic variants with diagnosis expression and treatment 
      response to lithium therapy. METHODS: The sample consisted of 103 and 85 
      outpatients with diagnosis of bipolar and unipolar disorder, respectively, and 
      101 controls. Two described polymorphisms of the 5-HTT, the variable number of 
      tandem repeat (VNTR) and serotonin transporter linked promoter (5-HTTLPR) 
      polymorphisms, were genotyped using standard procedures. RESULTS: The association 
      analysis performed showed a significantly higher rate of homozygous s/s genotype 
      for 5-HTTLPR among patients with a history of antidepressant-induced mania (60% 
      patients s/s versus 40% l/l, chi, P=0.04). No significant difference in the 
      distribution of genotypes of the two polymorphisms was observed between the three 
      groups. We found no significant association between these polymorphisms and 
      lithium response. CONCLUSIONS: The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism could be a useful 
      contributor, among other clinical variables, to predict the risk for manic 
      switches when a patient with bipolar disorder is treated with antidepressant 
      drugs. The contribution of these genetic markers in diagnosis expression and 
      treatment response to lithium is likely to be minor.

TI  - Interruptions in the expanded ATTCT repeat of spinocerebellar ataxia type 10: 
      repeat purity as a disease modifier?
PG  - 125-9
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is one of numerous genetic disorders that 
      result from simple repeat expansions. SCA10 is caused by expansion of an intronic 
      ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat tract. It is clinically characterized by progressive 
      ataxia, seizures, and anticipation, which can vary within and between families. 
      We report two SCA10 families showing distinct frequencies of seizures and 
      correlations of repeat length with age at onset. One family displayed 
      uninterrupted ATTCT expansions, whereas the other showed multiple interruptions 
      of the repeat by nonconsensus repeat units, which differed both in the length 
      and/or sequence of the repeat unit. Disease-causing microsatellite expansions 
      have been assumed to be composed of uninterrupted pure repeats. Our findings for 
      SCA10 challenge this convention and suggest that the purity of the expanded 
      repeat element may be a disease modifier.

TI  - Oligoproline effects on polyglutamine conformation and aggregation.
PG  - 524-35
AB  - There are nine known expanded CAG repeat neurological diseases, including 
      Huntington's disease (HD), each involving the repeat expansion of polyglutamine 
      (polyGln) in a different protein. Similar conditions can be induced in animal 
      models by expression of the polyGln sequence alone or in other protein contexts. 
      Besides the polyGln sequence, the cellular context of the disease protein, and 
      the sequence context of the polyGln within the disease protein, are both likely 
      to contribute to polyGln physical behavior and to pathology. In HD, the 
      N-terminal, exon-1 segment of the protein huntingtin contains the polyGln 
      sequence immediately followed by an oligoproline region. We show here that 
      introduction of a P10 sequence C-terminal to polyGln in synthetic peptides 
      decreases both the rate of formation and the apparent stability of the 
      amyloid-like aggregates associated with this family of diseases. The sequence can 
      be trimmed to P6 without altering the suppression, but a P3 sequence is 
      ineffective. Spacers up to at least three amino acid residues in length can be 
      inserted between polyGln and P10 without altering this effect. There is no 
      suppression, however, when the P10 sequence is either placed on the N-terminal 
      side of polyGln or attached to polyGln via a side-chain tether. The nucleation 
      mechanism of a Q40 sequence is unchanged upon addition of a P10 C-terminal 
      extension, yielding a critical nucleus of one. The effects of oligoPro length and 
      structural context on polyGln aggregation are correlated strongly with 
      alterations in the circular dichroism spectra of the monomeric peptides. For 
      example, the P10 sequence eliminates the small amount of alpha helical content 
      otherwise exhibited by the Q40 sequence. The P10 sequence may suppress 
      aggregation by stabilizing an aggregation-incompetent conformation of the 
      monomer. The effect is transportable: a P10 sequence fixed to the C terminus of 
      the sequence Abeta similarly modulates amyloid fibril formation.

TI  - An enhanced polymerase chain reaction assay to detect pre- and full mutation 
      alleles of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene.
PG  - 605-12
AB  - Several diagnostic strategies have been applied to the detection of FMR1 gene 
      repeat expansions in fragile X syndrome. Here, we report a novel polymerase chain 
      reaction-based strategy using the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche 
      Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and the osmolyte betaine. Repeat expansions up to 
      approximately 330 CGGs in males and up to at least approximately 160 CGGs in 
      carrier women could be easily visualized on ethidium bromide agarose gels. We 
      also demonstrated that fluorescence analysis of polymerase chain reaction 
      products was a reliable tool to verify the presence of premutation and full 
      mutation alleles both in males and in females. This technique, primarily designed 
      to detect premutation alleles, can be used as a routine first screen for expanded 
      FMR1 alleles.

TI  - The platelet maximum number of A2A-receptor binding sites (Bmax) linearly 
      correlates with age at onset and CAG repeat expansion in Huntington's disease 
      patients with predominant chorea.
PG  - 27-30
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expanded CAG mutation and may show a 
      heterogeneous clinical presentation. To date, although the age at onset mostly 
      depends on the expanded CAG repeat number, no validated easy-to-test biomarkers 
      exist either for following up patients progression rate or for exactly predicting 
      age at onset (defined as the time when motor clinical manifestations first became 
      noticeable). We tested the function of A(2A) receptor, strongly expressed in the 
      brain striatum and peripheral cells, in patients' blood platelets and confirmed a 
      maximum number of binding sites (B(max)) higher than in controls (216 +/- 9 
      versus 137 +/- 7; p=0.0001). We found a linear correlation between the receptor 
      B(max) and the expanded CAG repeat number (n=52, r(2)=0.19, p=0.0011). When we 
      selected the patients according to their clinical presentation (according to the 
      predominating motor manifestations) and plotted the receptor B(max) against 
      patients' age at onset, we found a significant linear correlation only when 
      considering those subjects with chorea predominant on all other motor symptoms 
      (n=26, r(2)=0.39, p=0.0007). Because the typical chorea may depend on early 
      dysfunction of the striatum in HD, peripheral A(2A) amplification in blood 
      platelets might reflect a central dysfunction in this part of the brain. Further 
      studies on a larger sample size should confirm whether the analysis of 
      A(2A)-receptor binding in patients' blood could be a useful clinical marker 
      according to the patients' phenotype.

TI  - Euploidy in somatic cells from R6/2 transgenic Huntington's disease mice.
PG  - 34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HD gene. The huntingtin protein expressed 
      from HD has an unknown function but is suggested to interact with proteins 
      involved in the cell division machinery. The R6/2 transgenic mouse is the most 
      widely used model to study HD. In R6/2 fibroblast cultures, a reduced mitotic 
      index and high frequencies of multiple centrosomes and aneuploid cells have 
      recently been reported. Aneuploidy is normally a feature closely connected to 
      neoplastic disease. To further explore this unexpected aspect of HD, we studied 
      cultures derived from 6- and 12-week-old R6/2 fibroblasts, skeletal muscle cells, 
      and liver cells. RESULTS: Cytogenetic analyses revealed a high frequency of 
      polyploid cells in cultures from both R6/2 and wild-type mice with the greatest 
      proportions of polyploid cells in cultures derived from skeletal muscle cells of 
      both genotypes. The presence of polyploid cells in skeletal muscle in vivo was 
      confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation with centromeric probes. Enlarged 
      and supernumerary centrosomes were found in cultures from both R6/2 and wild-type 
      mice. However, no aneuploid cells could be found in any of the tissues. 
      CONCLUSION: We conclude that polyploid cells are found in fibroblast and skeletal 
      muscle cultures derived from both R6/2 and wild-type littermate mice and that 
      aneuploidy is unlikely to be a hallmark of HD.

TI  - STin2 variant and family history of suicide as significant predictors of suicide 
      completion in major depression.
PG  - 114-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suicide is the most serious outcome of major depression, yet not all 
      depressed patients will commit suicide. Genes, along with other factors, might 
      account for this difference. Serotonergic alterations have been observed in 
      suicide and depression and impulsive-aggressive behaviors. Therefore, we aimed to 
      identify predictors of suicide, considering genetic variation at the serotonin 
      transporter (5-HTT) gene. METHODS: We investigated the 5-HTT gene-linked 
      polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and intron 2 (STin2) variants of this gene and 
      their relationship to behavioral and clinical risk factors for suicide in a 
      sample of depressed suicides (n =106) and depressed control subjects (n =152), 
      diagnosed by means of proxy-based interviews. RESULTS: We found a significant 
      association of suicide completion with having at least one copy of the STin2 10 
      allele [chi(2)(1) = 10.833, p = .002]. No differences were found for the 5-HTTLPR 
      variable number of tandem repeats. After controlling for behavioral and clinical 
      risk factors for suicide, the STin2 variant remained a significant predictor of 
      suicide in major depression when jointly considered with a family history of 
      suicide (odds ratio 5.560, 95% confidence interval 1.057-29.247). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The STin2 locus might account, at least in part, for the observed familial 
      aggregation of suicidal behavior. These results should be further explored in 
      families where clustering of suicidal behavior is observed.

TI  - Evaluation of the benzothiazole aggregation inhibitors riluzole and PGL-135 as 
      therapeutics for Huntington's disease.
PG  - 228-36
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited progressive neurological disorder for 
      which there is no effective therapy. It is caused by a CAG/polyglutamine repeat 
      expansion that leads to abnormal protein aggregation and deposition in the brain. 
      Several compounds have been shown to disrupt the aggregation process in vitro, 
      including a number of benzothiazoles. To further explore the therapeutic 
      potential of the benzothiazole aggregation inhibitors, we assessed PGL-135 and 
      riluzole in hippocampal slice cultures derived from the R6/2 mouse, confirming 
      their ability to inhibit aggregation with an EC50 of 40 microM in this system. 
      Preliminary pharmacological work showed that PGL-135 was metabolically unstable, 
      and therefore, we conducted a preclinical trial in the R6/2 mouse with riluzole. 
      At the maximum tolerated dose, we achieved steady-state riluzole levels of 100 
      microM in brain. However, this was insufficient to inhibit aggregation in vivo 
      and we found no improvement in the disease phenotype.

TI  - Candidate gene region for polycystic ovary syndrome on chromosome 19p13.2.
PG  - 6623-9
AB  - CONTEXT: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that is 
      believed to have a genetic basis. However, no specific susceptibility gene or 
      region has been conclusively identified. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study 
      was to duplicate a previous study that localized a PCOS susceptibility region to 
      chromosome 19p13.2 and to narrow the susceptibility region. DESIGN: This study 
      was designed to test for genetic linkage and association between PCOS and short 
      tandem repeat polymorphisms in 367 families, by analysis of linkage and 
      family-based association. SETTING: The study was conducted at academic medical 
      centers. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: We studied 367 families of predominantly 
      European origin with at least one PCOS patient. Families included 107 affected 
      sibling (sister) pairs (ASPs) in 83 families, and 390 trios with both parents and 
      an affected daughter. The data set comprises two independent groups. Set 1 
      consists of 44 ASPs and 163 trios. Set 2 consists of 63 ASPs and 227 trios. 
      INTERVENTION(S): The intervention was the drawing of blood for DNA extraction. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: We employed measures of evidence for linkage and 
      association between PCOS and 19 STRs. RESULTS: Linkage with PCOS was observed 
      over a broad region of chromosome 19p13.2. The strongest evidence for association 
      was observed with D19S884 (chi2 = 11.85; nominal P < 0.0006; permutation P = 
      0.034) and duplicated our earlier findings. CONCLUSIONS: The present analysis 
      suggests that a PCOS susceptibility locus maps very close to D19S884. Additional 
      studies that systematically characterize DNA sequence variation in the immediate 
      area of D19S884 are required to identify the PCOS susceptibility variant.

TI  - Family-based association study of serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms in 
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: no evidence for association in UK and 
      Taiwanese samples.
PG  - 11-3
AB  - Five independent studies have reported associations between serotonin transporter 
      gene (5-HTT) polymorphisms and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 
      Four studies found evidence for association between the long-allele of a 44-base 
      pair insertion/deletion polymorphism (5-HTTLPR), one of the studies found 
      association to a variable number tandem repeat within intron 2, another to the 
      T-allele of a single base pair substitution in the 3'-untranslated regions and 
      another reported preferential transmission of a haplotype of the three markers 
      (long-allele/10-repeat-allele/T-allele). One further study found no evidence for 
      these associations. We investigated the association of these three markers in two 
      samples of ADHD patients from the United Kingdom (n = 197) and Taiwan (n = 212), 
      using within-family tests of association. No association was found between any of 
      the three markers in either of the two populations. Although we found some 
      evidence for the preferential transmission of a rare haplotype 
      (long-allele/9-repeat-allele/T-allele; chi2 = 4.5, P = 0.034), we concluded that 
      this most likely occurred by chance factors alone.

TI  - Women's attitudes toward testing for fragile X carrier status: a qualitative 
      analysis.
PG  - 295-306
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is primarily due to a repeat expansion mutation found in 
      the FMR1 X-linked gene. We have conducted a qualitative analysis of responses 
      from women concerning their attitudes toward testing for carrier status of the 
      fragile X mutation among reproductive-age women. We obtained responses from focus 
      groups including women with and without FXS in their families. We found the 
      following themes: (1) mothers of children with FXS have difficulty formulating 
      their opinions on population screening because of their unique experiences 
      surrounding their own carrier diagnosis and their relationship with their 
      children with FXS, (2) the motivation for carrier testing and need for 
      information differ by family history of FXS and parental status, and (3) the 
      timing of carrier testing with respect to a woman's life stage dictates whether 
      carrier information will be viewed as beneficial or detrimental. There was 
      evidence that non-carrier women from the general population would be wholly 
      unprepared for positive carrier results. These findings have significant 
      implications for genetic counseling as well as for population screening.

TI  - Formation of morphologically similar globular aggregates from diverse 
      aggregation-prone proteins in mammalian cells.
PG  - 10887-92
AB  - Huntington's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      polyglutamine repeat expansion in the first exon of the huntingtin (Htt) protein. 
      N-terminal Htt peptides with polyglutamine tracts in the pathological range 
      (51-122 glutamines) form high-molecular-weight protein aggregates with fibrillar 
      morphology in vitro, and they form discrete inclusion bodies in a cell-culture 
      model. However, in some studies, formation of discrete Htt inclusions does not 
      correlate well with cell death. We coexpressed N-terminal Htt fragments 
      containing 91 glutamines fused to different affinity tags in HEK293 cells, and we 
      isolated small aggregates by double sequential-affinity chromatography to assure 
      the isolation of multimeric molecules. Transmission electron microscopy and 
      atomic force microscopy revealed the isolated aggregates as globules or clusters 
      of globules 4-50 nm in diameter without any detectable fibrillar species. Because 
      small nonfibrillar oligomers, not mature fibrils, recently have been suggested to 
      be the principal cytotoxic species in neurodegenerative disease, these Htt 
      globular aggregates formed in cells may represent the pathogenic form of mutant 
      Htt.

TI  - Regional and subtype selective changes of neurotransmitter receptor density in a 
      rat transgenic for the Huntington's disease mutation.
PG  - 639-50
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited progressive 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion in the 
      gene encoding the huntingtin protein. We have recently generated a rat model 
      transgenic for HD, which displays a slowly progressive phenotype resembling the 
      human adult-onset type of disease. In this study we systematically assessed the 
      distribution and density of 17 transmitter receptors in the brains of 2-year-old 
      rats using quantitative multi-tracer autoradiography and high-resolution positron 
      emission tomography. Heterozygous animals expressed increased densities of M(2) 
      acetylcholine (increase of 148 +/- 16% of controls; p > 0.001; n = 7), nicotine 
      (increase of 149 +/- 16% of controls; p > 0.01; n = 6), and alpha(2) 
      noradrenergic receptors (increase of 141 +/- 15% of controls; p > 0.001; n = 6), 
      respectively. Densities of these receptors were decreased in homozygous animals. 
      Decreases of receptor density in both hetero- and homozygous animals were found 
      for M1 acetylcholine, 5-HT 2A serotonin, A 2A adenosine, D1 and D2 dopamine, and 
      GABA(A) receptors, respectively. Other investigated receptor systems showed small 
      changes or were not affected. The present data suggest that the moderate increase 
      of CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansions in the present rat model of Huntington's 
      disease is characterized by subtype-selective and region-specific changes of 
      neuroreceptor densities. In particular, there is evidence for a contribution of 
      predominantly presynaptically localized cholinergic and noradrenergic receptors 
      in the response to Huntington's disease pathology.

TI  - Association study of a novel functional polymorphism of the serotonin transporter 
      gene in bipolar disorder and suicidal behaviour.
PG  - 128-31
AB  - A serotonin transporter gene linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) has been 
      investigated in several genetic association studies, including studies of bipolar 
      disorder (BD) and suicidality. The current study was designed to examine whether 
      the new long (A/G) variant polymorphism of the 5-HTT gene may be associated with 
      the suicide attempts in 305 families with at least one member having BD. No 
      association with history of suicide attempt was found either in the multiallelic 
      HTTLPR (LRS=0.15, df=2, P=0.92), or with the intron 2 variable number tandem 
      repeat (VNTR) polymorphism (LRS=0.87 df=2 P=0.64). When we performed a haplotype 
      analysis, we found no association between suicide attempt and haplotype 
      distribution (LRS=1.84 df=4 P=0.76). These findings suggest that this new 
      polymorphism in the 5-HTT gene may not influence suicidal behaviour in patients 
      with bipolar disorder.

TI  - Interleukin-1 gene cluster polymorphisms predict risk of ESRD.
PG  - 278-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease manifest an inflammatory state 
      relative to healthy individuals. Inflammation is regulated in part by genes of 
      the interleukin-1 (IL-1) gene cluster. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in this 
      gene cluster may be associated with risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 
      METHODS: Polymorphisms in the IL-1 gene cluster were examined in a cohort of 239 
      racially diverse hemodialysis (HD) patients and 252 controls. These individuals 
      were genotyped for 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-1alpha and 
      beta genes, and a variable-number-of-tandem-repeats polymorphism in the IL-1 
      receptor antagonist gene (IL-1RN). Polymorphisms were analyzed by logistic 
      regression for their independent associations with ESRD, and the effect of allele 
      dose of IL-1RN on risk for ESRD was examined. The interaction between race and 
      genotype was also investigated. RESULTS: A logistic regression model demonstrated 
      that homozygosity for allele 2 of the IL-1RN variable-number-of-tandem-repeats 
      (VNTR) polymorphism was associated with ESRD independent of race (P < 0.0005). 
      The IL-1alpha-889 promoter SNP was associated with ESRD independent of race and 
      of the IL-1RN polymorphism (P= 0.04). The IL-1beta-511 promoter SNP is associated 
      with ESRD, but this is accounted for by race (P= 0.04). CONCLUSION: Two 
      polymorphisms within the IL-1 gene cluster are associated with ESRD independent 
      of race. This finding is one of the strongest associations between genotype and 
      ESRD reported, and suggests that polymorphisms in the IL-1 gene cluster affect 
      the risk of development of ESRD.

TI  - Early changes in Huntington's disease patient brains involve alterations in 
      cytoskeletal and synaptic elements.
PG  - 517-33
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the 
      N-terminus of the huntingtin protein. Huntingtin is normally present in the 
      cytoplasm where it may interact with structural and synaptic elements. The 
      mechanism of HD pathogenesis remains unknown but studies indicate a toxic 
      gain-of-function possibly through aberrant protein interactions. To investigate 
      whether early degenerative changes in HD involve alterations of cytoskeletal and 
      vesicular components, we examined early cellular changes in the frontal cortex of 
      HD presymptomatic (PS), early pathological grade (grade 1) and late-stage (grade 
      3 and 4) patients as compared to age-matched controls. Morphologic analysis using 
      silver impregnation revealed a progressive decrease in neuronal fiber density and 
      organization in pyramidal cell layers beginning in presymptomatic HD cases. 
      Immunocytochemical analyses for the cytoskeletal markers alpha -tubulin, 
      microtubule-associated protein 2, and phosphorylated neurofilament demonstrated a 
      concomitant loss of staining in early grade cases. Immunoblotting for synaptic 
      proteins revealed a reduction in complexin 2, which was marked in some grade 1 HD 
      cases and significantly reduced in all late stage cases. Interestingly, we 
      demonstrate that two synaptic proteins, dynamin and PACSIN 1, which were 
      unchanged by immunoblotting, showed a striking loss by immunocytochemistry 
      beginning in early stage HD tissue suggesting abnormal distribution of these 
      proteins. We propose that mutant huntingtin affects proteins involved in synaptic 
      function and cytoskeletal integrity before symptoms develop which may influence 
      early disease onset and/or progression.

TI  - Verification of somatic CAG repeat expansion by pre-PCR fractionation.
PG  - 11-7
AB  - The inheritance of a long CAG repeat causes several late onset neurological 
      disorders including Huntington's disease (HD). Longer CAG repeats correlate with 
      earlier onset of HD suggesting an increased toxicity for the products of long 
      repeat alleles. PCR based data has been used to show that HD CAG repeat expansion 
      beyond the inherited length occurs in affected tissues indicating a possible role 
      for somatic instability in the disease process. PCR, however, is prone to 
      artifacts resulting from expansion of repeat sequences during amplification. We 
      describe a method to distinguish between CAG repeat expansions that exist in vivo 
      and those that potentially occur during PCR. The method involves size 
      fractionation of genomic restriction fragments containing the expanded repeats 
      followed by PCR amplification. The application of this method confirms the 
      presence of somatic expansions in the brains of a knock-in mouse model of HD.

TI  - Ancient origin of the CAG expansion causing Huntington disease in a Spanish 
      population.
PG  - 453-9
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized clinically by progressive motor impairment, cognitive decline, and 
      emotional deterioration. The disease is caused by the abnormal expansion of a CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat in the first exon of the huntingtin gene in chromosome 
      4p16.3. HD is spread worldwide and it is generally accepted that few mutational 
      events account for the origin of the pathogenic CAG expansion in most 
      populations. We have investigated the genetic history of HD mutation in 83 family 
      probands from the Land of Valencia, in Eastern Spain. An analysis of the HD/CCG 
      repeat in informative families suggested that at least two main chromosomes were 
      associated in the Valencian population, one associated with allele 7 (77 mutant 
      chromosomes) and one associated with allele 10 (two mutant chromosomes). 
      Haplotype A-7-A (H1) was observed in 47 out of 48 phase-known mutant chromosomes, 
      obtained by segregation analysis, through the haplotype analysis of 
      rs1313770-HD/CCG-rs82334, as it also was in 120 out of 166 chromosomes 
      constructed by means of the PHASE program. The genetic history and geographical 
      distribution of the main haplotype H1 were both studied by constructing extended 
      haplotypes with flanking short tandem repeats (STRs) D4S106 and D4S3034. We found 
      that we were able to determine the age of the CAG expansion associated with the 
      haplotype H1 as being between 4,700 and 10,000 years ago. Furthermore, we 
      observed a nonhomogenous distribution in the different regions associated with 
      the different extended haplotypes of the ancestral haplotype H1, suggesting that 
      local founder effects have occurred.

      protein kinase C gamma gene (PRKCG), rather than a nucleotide repeat expansion. 
      In this large-scale study of PRKCG in patients with ataxia, two new missense

TI  - RNA interference improves motor and neuropathological abnormalities in a 
      Huntington's disease mouse model.
PG  - 5820-5
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal, dominant neurogenetic disorder. HD results 
      from polyglutamine repeat expansion (CAG codon, Q) in exon 1 of HD, conferring a 
      toxic gain of function on the protein huntingtin (htt). Currently, no 
      preventative treatment exists for HD. RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a 
      potential therapeutic tool for treating dominant diseases by directly reducing 
      disease gene expression. Here, we show that RNAi directed against mutant human 
      htt reduced htt mRNA and protein expression in cell culture and in HD mouse 
      brain. Importantly, htt gene silencing improved behavioral and neuropathological 
      abnormalities associated with HD. Our data provide support for the further 
      development of RNAi for HD therapy.

TI  - Evidence for, and a spectrum of, neurological involvement in carriers of the 
      fragile X pre-mutation: FXTAS and beyond.
PG  - 412-7
AB  - A neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS), occurs in some older men carrying a small CGG repeat expansion 
      (pre-mutation) in the FMR1 gene. We surveyed a sample of older pre-mutation males 
      to estimate the prevalence and spectrum of neurological involvement. Twelve 
      pre-mutation males aged 50-82 years and 11 age-matched normal controls 
      ascertained in an unbiased manner were included in a neurological assessment that 
      also used standard scales for tremor (Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor), ataxia 
      (International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale, ICARS) and parkinsonian signs 
      (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale). Axial FLAIR images of the brain, and 
      neuropsychological and molecular tests were also conducted in pre-mutation 
      carriers. The neurological disorder meeting all the criteria for diagnosis of 
      'definite' to 'possible' FXTAS occurred in five of 12 pre-mutation carriers 
      (41.7%), and this prevalence was significantly higher compared with normal 
      controls (0%). The ataxia (ICARS) score and the sum of all three tremor/ataxia 
      scores were significantly higher in pre-mutation carriers than in controls, and 
      mRNA was elevated in all but one carrier, but did not correlate with the degree 
      of neurological involvement. In conclusion, the findings provide further evidence 
      that the pre-mutation allele of FMR1 is a significant cause of late-onset 
      neurodegeneration, presenting with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations.

PG  - 299-301
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a well-defined autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by CAG repeat expansions in HD gene. There are a significant 
      number of HD cases where this mutation was not found and such cases are named 
      HD-like phenotype (HDL). This article reports 48 patients with HDL phenotype. 
      Patients were analyzed on the presence of mutations in prion (PrP), ferritin and 
      junctophilin-3 (JP-3) genes. None of the patients showed the presence of the 
      mutation in analyzed genes. This could suggest that there is some other 
      gene/genes where the mutation can cause the disease with clinical features of HD.

TI  - A functional genetic variation of the serotonin (5-HT) transporter affects 5-HT1A 
      receptor binding in humans.
PG  - 2586-90
AB  - In humans, 5-HT1A receptors are implicated in anxiety and depressive disorders 
      and their treatment. However, the physiological and genetic factors controlling 
      5-HT1A receptor expression are undetermined in health and disease. In this study, 
      the influence of two genetic factors on 5-HT1A receptor expression in the living 
      human brain was assessed using the 5-HT1A-selective positron emission tomography 
      (PET) ligand [11C]WAY 100635. After the genotyping of 140 healthy volunteers to 
      study population frequencies of known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
      the 5-HT1A receptor gene, the influence of the common SNP [(-1018) C>G] on 5-HT1A 
      receptor expression was examined in a group of 35 healthy individuals scanned 
      with [11C]WAY 100635. In the PET group, we also studied the influence of a common 
      variable number tandem repeat polymorphism [short (S) and long (L) alleles] of 
      the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) gene on 5-HT1A receptor density. Whereas, the 5-HT1A 
      receptor genotype did not show any significant effects on [11C]WAY 100635 
      binding, 5-HT1A receptor binding potential values were lower in all brain regions 
      in subjects with 5-HTTLPR short (SS or SL) genotypes than those with long (LL) 
      genotypes. Although the PET groups are necessarily a small sample size for a 
      genetic association study, our results demonstrate for the first time that a 
      functional polymorphism in the 5-HTT gene, but not the 5-HT1A receptor gene, 
      affects 5-HT1A receptor availability in man. The results may offer a plausible 
      physiological mechanism underlying the association between 5-HTTLPR genotype, 
      behavioral traits, and mood states.

TI  - Serotonin transporter and tryptophan hydroxylase gene polymorphisms in Chinese 
      patients with generalized anxiety disorder.
PG  - 7-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) 
      gene are important candidate genes for the psychiatric disorders. Many studies of 
      patients with anxiety disorders have found abnormalities of serotonin metabolism 
      and dysfunction of regulation in the transporter itself. In this study, we 
      hypothesize that genetic variation in the 5-HTT and TPH gene may have an effect 
      on the etiology of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). METHODS: Using a 
      polymerase chain reaction-based technique, the allele and genotype frequencies of 
      three polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene (a deletion/insertion 
      polymorphism in the transcriptional control region and a variable number of 
      tandem repeats in intron 2) and TPH gene (A218C in intron 7) were analyzed in 138 
      patients with GAD and 90 healthy controls. These two groups were matched for 
      ethnic and geographic origin. RESULTS: The frequencies of 5-HTT gene-linked 
      functional polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) SS (short/short) genotype were 
      significantly higher in GAD patients than in control subjects (68% versus 49%, 
      chi = 12.274, df = 2, P = 0.002), and the frequencies of S (short) allele 
      observed in the GAD patients were higher than those in healthy subjects (79 
      versus 71%, chi = 4.063, df = 1, P = 0.044). The odds ratio for the SS genotype 
      versus the other two genotypes was 2.33 (95% confidence interval, 1.29-3.86). 
      Similarly, the odds ratio for the S allele versus L allele was 1.56 (95% 
      confidence interval, 1.01-2.41). The genotypic and allelic distribution of 5-HTT 
      VNTR and TPH A218C polymorphisms did not show statistically significant 
      differences between patients and controls. CONCLUSION: Our findings support that 
      the presence of 5-HTTLPR-SS genotype may increase the risk of GAD.

TI  - SNP genotyping to screen for a common deletion in CHARGE syndrome.
PG  - 8
AB  - BACKGROUND: CHARGE syndrome is a complex of birth defects including coloboma, 
      choanal atresia, ear malformations and deafness, cardiac defects, and growth 
      delay. We have previously hypothesized that CHARGE syndrome could be caused by 
      unidentified genomic microdeletion, but no such deletion was detected using short 
      tandem repeat (STR) markers spaced an average of 5 cM apart. Recently, 
      microdeletion at 8q12 locus was reported in two patients with CHARGE, although 
      point mutation in CHD7 on chromosome 8 was the underlying etiology in most of the 
      affected patients. METHODS: We have extended our previous study by employing a 
      much higher density of SNP markers (3258) with an average spacing of 
      approximately 800 kb. These SNP markers are diallelic and, therefore, have much 
      different properties for detection of deletions than STRs. RESULTS: A global 
      error rate estimate was produced based on Mendelian inconsistency. One marker, 
      rs431722 exceeded the expected frequency of inconsistencies, but no deletion 
      could be demonstrated after retesting the 4 inconsistent pedigrees with local 
      flanking markers or by FISH with the corresponding BAC clone. Expected deletion 
      detection (EDD) was used to assess the coverage of specific intervals over the 
      genome by deriving the probability of detecting a common loss of heterozygosity 
      event over each genomic interval. This analysis estimated the fraction of 
      unobserved deletions, taking into account the allele frequencies at the SNPs, the 
      known marker spacing and sample size. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our genotyping 
      indicate that more than 35% of the genome is included in regions with very low 
      probability of a deletion of at least 2 Mb.

TI  - Mitochondrial impairment in patients and asymptomatic mutation carriers of 
      Huntington's disease.
PG  - 674-9
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the IT-15 gene; however, it remains 
      unknown how the mutation leads to selective neurodegeneration. Several lines of 
      evidence suggest impaired mitochondrial function as a component of the 
      neurodegenerative process in HD. We assessed energy metabolism in the skeletal 
      muscle of 15 HD patients and 12 asymptomatic mutation carriers in vivo using 31P 
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Phosphocreatine recovery after exercise is a 
      direct measure of ATP synthesis and was slowed significantly in HD patients and 
      mutation carriers in comparison to age- and gender-matched healthy controls. We 
      found that oxidative function is impaired to a similar extent in manifest HD 
      patients and asymptomatic mutation carriers. Our findings suggest that 
      mitochondrial dysfunction is an early and persistent component of the 
      pathophysiology of HD.

TI  - Neural progenitor cells from an adult patient with fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 2
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no adequate animal model to study the detailed 
      molecular biochemistry of fragile X syndrome, the leading heritable form of 
      mental impairment. In this study, we sought to establish the use of immature 
      neural cells derived from adult tissues as a novel model of fragile X syndrome 
      that could be used to more fully understand the pathology of this neurogenetic 
      disease. METHODS: By modifying published methods for the harvest of neural 
      progenitor cells from the post-mortem human brain, neural cells were successfully 
      harvested and grown from post-mortem brain tissue of a 25-year-old adult male 
      with fragile X syndrome, and from brain tissue of a patient with no neurological 
      disease. RESULTS: The cultured fragile X cells displayed many of the 
      characteristics of neural progenitor cells, including nestin and CD133 
      expression, as well as the biochemical hallmarks of fragile X syndrome, including 
      CGG repeat expansion and a lack of FMRP expression. CONCLUSION: The successful 
      production of neural cells from an individual with fragile X syndrome opens a new 
      avenue for the scientific study of the molecular basis of this disorder, as well 
      as an approach for studying the efficacy of new therapeutic agents.

TI  - Serotonin transporter intron 2 polymorphism associated with rigid-compulsive 
      behaviors in Dutch individuals with pervasive developmental disorder.
PG  - 93-6
AB  - Two putatively functional polymorphisms of the serotonin transporter gene (HTT, 
      SLC6A4) were examined for associations with risk for pervasive developmental 
      disorders (PDDs) and specific autism phenotypes. Dutch patients diagnosed with 
      PDD (N = 125, age range 5-20 years, DSM-IV-TR based criteria, ADI-R and ADOS 
      behavioral assessments) and their parents (N = 230) were genotyped for promoter 
      ins/del (5-HTTLPR) and intron 2 variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) alleles. 
      Using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT), no disorder-specific 
      preferential transmission of promoter (long and short) or intron 2 (10- and 
      12-repeat) alleles was observed. However, multivariate analysis of continuous 
      autism-related behavioral measures revealed that subjects with intron 2 12/12 
      genotype were significantly more impaired in the rigid-compulsive domain (P = 
      0.008). Quantitative TDT (QTDT) analysis also showed significant association of 
      the intron 2 VNTR 12-repeat allele with rigid-compulsive behavior (P = 0.015). 
      These results suggest that intron 2 VNTR alleles or nearby polymorphisms in 
      linkage disequilibrium may play a role in specific aspects of the behavioral 
      phenotype of autism.

TI  - Meta-analysis of the association between two polymorphisms in the serotonin 
      transporter gene and affective disorders.
PG  - 110-5
AB  - Family, twin, and adoption studies show that psychiatric diseases including 
      bipolar disorder (BP) and unipolar disorder (UP) have a substantial genetic 
      component. For these illnesses, both positive and negative associations have been 
      reported for two polymorphisms located in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT) 
      on chromosome 17: a 17-base-pair (bp) variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) in 
      intron 2 and a 44-bp insertion/deletion in the promoter region. Thus, 
      associations between these 5-HTT polymorphisms and affective disorders remain 
      unclear. The present work investigates these potential associations in 
      meta-analyzes that maximize the power to find associations between each disease 
      and the two 5-HTT polymorphisms. We applied meta-analysis techniques to 
      case-control studies of two 5-HTT polymorphisms and two affective disorders (BP 
      and UP), resulting in four meta-analyzes. For each polymorphism, we assessed the 
      evidence for allelic associations, heterogeneity among studies, the influence of 
      individual studies, and the potential for publication bias. The short allele(s) 
      of the 44-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism showed a significant association for 
      BP (odds ratio (OR) = 1.13, P = 0.001) but not UP. For the 17-bp VNTR, an 
      increase in the number of tandem repeats had no significant association with any 
      of the disorders. The small but significant effects of the 44-bp 
      insertion/deletion polymorphism for BP is consistent with being one of many genes 
      that contributes to the multi-factorial nature of these psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Relationship between suicidal behavior of psychotic inpatients and serotonin 
      transporter gene in Han Chinese.
PG  - 94-8
AB  - Strong evidence indicates that central serotoninergic system dysfunction is 
      associated with suicidal behavior. The relationship between the serotonin 
      transporter protein (5-HTT) gene of psychotic patients in Han Chinese with 
      suicidal behavior was studied since the 5-HTT plays an important role in 
      serotoninergic transmission. Two hundred and seventy-two psychotic inpatients 
      with suicidal behavior (suicide group) and 275 psychotic inpatients without 
      suicidal behavior (patient control group) were recruited from six mental health 
      facilities in Shanghai, China. Another 628 healthy adults (healthy control group) 
      without suicidal behavior and mental disorder history were enrolled from 
      Shanghai, China. All subjects were Han Chinese. The genotypes and the alleles of 
      5-HTT genes of the three groups were examined by PCR amplification. Neither the 
      intron 2 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism and 5-HTTLPR (5-HTT 
      gene-linked polymorphic region), nor the haplotype frequencies of this gene have 
      significant differences between the suicide group and the two control groups. 
      However, there was a significant difference in 5-HTTLPR polymorphism between 
      inpatients with a first episode of suicidal behavior and those with recurrent 
      suicidal behavior. Except for the possible heterogeneity between inpatients with 
      a first episode of suicidal behavior and those with more than one, the 5-HTT gene 
      was unlikely to be associated with suicidal behavior of psychotic patient in Han 
      Chinese.

TI  - Biochemical, ultrastructural, and reversibility studies on huntingtin filaments 
      isolated from mouse and human brain.
PG  - 9361-71
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) and eight additional inherited neurological disorders 
      are caused by CAG triplet-repeat expansions leading to expanded 
      polyglutamine-sequences in their respective proteins. These triplet-CAG repeat 
      disorders have in common the formation of aberrant intraneuronal proteinaceous 
      inclusions containing the expanded polyglutamine sequences. These aggregates have 
      been postulated to contribute to pathogenesis caused by conformational toxicity, 
      sequestration of other polyglutamine-containing proteins, or by interfering with 
      certain enzymatic activities. Testing these hypotheses has been hampered by the 
      difficulty to isolate these aggregates from brain. Here we report that 
      polyglutamine aggregates can be isolated from the brain of the Tet/HD94 
      conditional mouse model of HD, by following a method based on high salt buffer 
      homogenization, nonionic detergent extraction, and gradient fractionation. We 
      then verified that the method can be successfully applied to postmortem HD 
      brains. Immunoelectron microscopy, both in human and mouse samples, revealed that 
      the stable component of the inclusions are mutant huntingtin-containing and 
      ubiquitin-containing fibrils. Atomic-force microscopy revealed that these fibrils 
      have a "beads on a string" morphology. Thus, they resemble the in vitro assembled 
      filaments made of recombinant mutant-huntingtin, as well as the Abeta and 
      alpha-synuclein amyloid protofibrils. Finally, by shutting down transgene 
      expression in the Tet/HD94 conditional mouse model of HD, we were able to 
      demonstrate that these filaments, although stable in vitro, are susceptible to 
      revert in vivo, thus demonstrating that the previously reported reversal of 
      ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions does not simply reflect disassembling of the 
      inclusions into their constituent fibrils and suggesting that any associated 
      conformational or protein-sequestration toxicity is also likely to revert.

TI  - The effect of pre-mutation of X chromosome CGG trinucleotide repeats on brain 
      anatomy.
PG  - 2672-81
AB  - Expanded trinucleotide repeats are associated with several neuropsychiatric 
      disorders, including fragile X syndrome (FraX) which is the most common inherited 
      form of mental retardation. It is currently thought that FraX results from having 
      >200 CGG trinucleotide repeats, with consequent methylation of the fragile X 
      mental retardation gene (FMR1) and loss of FMR1 protein (FMRP). Pre-mutation 
      carriers of FraX (with 55-200 CGG trinucleotide repeats) were originally 
      considered unaffected, although recent studies challenge this view. However, 
      there are few studies on the effect of pre-mutation trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion on the male human brain using quantitative MRI. Also the results of 
      prior investigations may be confounded because people were selected on the basis 
      of clinical and neurological features, and not genetic phenotype. We compared the 
      brain anatomy of 20 adult male pre-mutation members of known FraX families with 
      20 healthy male controls. The two groups did not differ significantly in age, 
      intelligence quotient (IQ) or handedness. We also investigated whether any 
      observed effects were associated with: (i) ageing; (ii) expansion of pre-mutation 
      CGG trinucleotide repeats; (iii) reduction in the percentage of lymphocytes 
      staining with anti-FMRP antibodies [%FMRP(+) lymphocytes]; and (iv) elevation of 
      FMR1 mRNA levels. Male pre-mutation carriers of FraX, compared with matched 
      controls, had significantly less voxel density in several brain regions, 
      including the cerebellum, amygdalo-hippocampal complex and thalamus. Within 
      pre-mutation carriers of FraX, ageing, increases in the number of CGG 
      trinucleotide repeats and decreases in %FMRP(+) lymphocytes were associated with 
      decreasing voxel density of regions previously identified as decreased relative 
      to controls. Regional grey and white matter density is significantly affected in 
      male pre-mutation carriers of FraX recruited on the basis of genetic, not 
      clinical, phenotype. The association of voxel density reduction and ageing is 
      consistent with observations of a subgroup of older pre-mutation males who 
      present with cognitive decline. Moreover, our findings suggest, for the first 
      time, an association between voxel density reduction and genetic variation in 
      FraX.

TI  - Huntington's Disease-like 2 (HDL2) in North America and Japan.
PG  - 670-4
AB  - Huntington's Disease-like 2 (HDL2) is a progressive, autosomal dominant, 
      neurodegenerative disorder with marked clinical and pathological similarities to 
      Huntington's disease (HD). The causal mutation is a CTG/CAG expansion mutation on 
      chromosome 16q24.3, in a variably spliced exon of junctophilin-3. The frequency 
      of HDL2 was determined in nine independent series of patients referred for HD 
      testing or selected for the presence of an HD-like phenotype in North America or 
      Japan. The repeat length, ancestry, and age of onset of all North American HDL2 
      cases were determined. The results show that HDL2 is very rare, with a frequency 
      of 0 to 15% among patients in the nine case series with an HD-like presentation 
      who do not have the HD mutation. HDL2 is predominantly, and perhaps exclusively, 
      found in individuals of African ancestry. Repeat expansions ranged from 44 to 57 
      triplets, with length instability in maternal transmission detected in a repeat 
      of r2=0.29, p=0.0098). The results further support the evidence that the repeat 
      expansion at the chromosome 16q24.3 locus is the direct cause of HDL2 and provide 
      preliminary guidelines for the genetic testing of patients with an HD-like 
      phenotype.

TI  - Increased expression of p62 in expanded polyglutamine-expressing cells and its 
      association with polyglutamine inclusions.
PG  - 57-68
AB  - Huntington's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is 
      associated with a CAG repeat expansion in the gene encoding huntingtin. We found 
      that a 60-kDa protein was increased in Neuro2a cells expressing the N-terminal 
      portion of huntingtin with expanded polyglutamine. We purified this protein, and, 
      using mass spectrometry, identified it as p62, an ubiquitin-associated 
      domain-containing protein. A specific p62 antibody stained the ubiquitylated 
      polyQ inclusions in expanded polyglutamine-expressing cells, as well as in the 
      brain of the huntingtin exon 1 transgenic mice. Furthermore, the level of p62 
      protein and mRNA was increased in expanded polyglutamine-expressing cells. We 
      also found that p62 formed aggresome-like inclusions when p62 was increased in 
      normal Neuro2a cells by a proteasome inhibitor. Knock-down of p62 does not affect 
      the formation of aggresomes or polyglutamine inclusions, suggesting that p62 is 
      recruited to the aggresome or inclusions secondary to their formation. These 
      results suggest that p62 may play important roles as a responsive protein to a 
      polyglutamine-induced stress rather than as a cross-linker between ubiquitylated 
      proteins.

TI  - Association between a functional polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene 
      and diarrhoea predominant irritable bowel syndrome in women.
PG  - 1452-8
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Serotonin (5-hydroxtryptamine, 5-HT) is an important factor 
      in gut function, playing key roles in intestinal peristalsis and secretion, and 
      in sensory signalling in the brain-gut axis. Removal from its sites of action is 
      mediated by a specific protein called the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT or 
      5-HTT). Polymorphisms in the promoter region of the SERT gene have effects on 
      transcriptional activity, resulting in altered 5-HT reuptake efficiency. It has 
      been speculated that such functional polymorphisms may underlie disturbance in 
      gut function in individuals suffering with disorders such as irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS). The aim of this study was to assess the potential association 
      between SERT polymorphisms and the diarrhoea predominant IBS (dIBS) phenotype. 
      SUBJECTS: A total of 194 North American Caucasian female dIBS patients and 448 
      female Caucasian controls were subjected to genotyping. METHODS: Leucocyte DNA of 
      all subjects was analysed by polymerase chain reaction based technologies for 
      nine SERT polymorphisms, including the insertion/deletion polymorphism in the 
      promoter (SERT-P) and the variable tandem repeat in intron 2. Statistical 
      analysis was performed to assess association of any SERT polymorphism allele with 
      the dIBS phenotype. RESULTS: A strong genotypic association was observed between 
      the SERT-P deletion/deletion genotype and the dIBS phenotype (p = 3.07x10(-5); n 
      = 194). None of the other polymorphisms analysed was significantly associated 
      with the presence of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Significant association was observed 
      between dIBS and the SERT-P deletion/deletion genotype, suggesting that the 
      serotonin transporter is a potential candidate gene for dIBS in women.

TI  - Patterns of CAG repeat interruptions in SCA1 and SCA2 genes in relation to repeat 
      instability.
PG  - 236-47
AB  - About 3% of the human genome is composed of simple sequence repeats and many of 
      these sequences occur within genes. These repeats are often polymorphic in a 
      normal population and their expansion in specific genes leads to a number of 
      hereditary neurological diseases. Normal variants of disease-related genes 
      contain either pure or interrupted repeats, and the postulated function of the 
      interruptions is to prevent repeat expansions. Their structural role in the 
      repeat tracts of genes and transcripts awaits detailed characterization. In this 
      study, we have determined the SCA1 and SCA2 genotypes in a Polish population and 
      found significant differences in allele spectra and frequencies from those 
      reported for other populations. They are discussed in relation to the repeat 
      expansion mechanism and disease incidence. We postulate that the dynamic mutation 
      of the genes SCA1 (also ATX1 or ataxin 1) and SCA2 (also ATX2 or ataxin 2) may 
      begin from the expansion of long pure repeat tracts without the prior loss of 
      interruptions. A simple way of cost-effective allelotyping of CAG repeat regions 
      in the SCA1 and SCA2genes is also shown. The reliable SSCP/duplex analysis 
      presented here may be the method of choice for the systematic searching of genes 
      for known and novel interrupted repeats.

TI  - YB-1 and CTCF differentially regulate the 5-HTT polymorphic intron 2 enhancer 
      which predisposes to a variety of neurological disorders.
PG  - 5966-73
AB  - The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene contains a variable number tandem repeat 
      (VNTR) domain within intron 2 that is often associated with a number of 
      neurological conditions, including affective disorders. The implications of this 
      polymorphism are not yet understood, however, we have previously demonstrated 
      that the 5-HTT VNTR is a transcriptional regulatory domain, and the allelic 
      variation supports differential reporter gene expression in vivo and in vitro. 
      The aim of this study was to identify transcription factors responsible for the 
      regulation of this VNTR. Using a yeast one-hybrid screen, we found the 
      transcription factor Y box binding protein 1 (YB-1) interacts with the 5-HTT 
      VNTR. Consistent with this, we demonstrate in a reporter gene assay that the 
      polymorphic VNTR domains differentially respond to exogenous YB-1 and that YB-1 
      will bind to the VNTR in vitro in a sequence-specific manner. Interestingly, the 
      transcription factor CCTC-binding factor (CTCF), previously shown to interact 
      with YB-1, interferes with the ability of the VNTR to support YB-1-directed 
      reporter gene expression. In addition, CTCF blocks the binding of YB-1 to its DNA 
      recognition sequences in vitro, thus providing a possible mechanism of regulation 
      of YB-1 activation of the VNTR by CTCF. Therefore, we have identified YB-1 and 
      CTCF as transcription factors responsible, at least in part, for modulation of 
      VNTR function as a transcriptional regulatory domain. Our data suggest a novel 
      mechanism that explains, in part, the ability of the distinct VNTR copy numbers 
      to support differential reporter gene expression based on YB-1 binding sites.

TI  - CAG nucleotide repeat profiles in persons with schizophrenia or schizoaffective 
      disorders with and without tardive dyskinesia: pilot study.
PG  - 15-8
AB  - Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a drug-induced syndrome of involuntary movements often 
      associated with neuroleptic treatment of psychiatric conditions. Huntington's 
      disease (HD) and other neurological conditions are caused by CAG nucleotide 
      repeat expansions in specific genes. We, therefore, explore the hypothesis that 
      TD may be related to CAG repeat expansion by using the repeat expansion detection 
      (RED) method as a measure of CAG content without knowledge of the location of the 
      responsible gene. The number of CAG repeats ([CAG](n)) from persons with 
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders with (n = 10) and without (n = 9) TD 
      are determined. A comparison of [CAG](n) in persons with (56.90 +/- 23.45 
      repeats) and without (57.00 +/- 19.35 repeats) TD was not statistically 
      different. The total [CAG](n) was determined by combining [CAG](n) for both 
      groups. The median of 45 repeats was used to divide the total into two groups 
      (SG1 and SG2 with smaller and larger [CAG](n) fragments, respectively) and a 
      means analysis of the two subgroups based on [CAG](n) demonstrated that SG1 (n = 
      10 samples at 45 repeats per sample, mean [CAG](n) = 45.00 +/- 0.00) was 
      significantly smaller than SG2 (n = 9, ranging from 48 to 120 repeats, mean = 
      70.22 +/- 24.83; P < 0.005). Thus, this lends support to the idea of CAG repeat 
      expansions in the study population. Results are encouraging that a larger 
      population and a more structured subject selection process may yield more 
      meaningful information about the relationship between CAG repeat expansion and 
      TD.

TI  - Assessment of in vitro and in vivo mitochondrial function in Friedreich's ataxia 
      and Huntington's disease.
PG  - 293-307
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) and Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) are associated with 
      defects of respiratory-chain enzyme activities. In the respective disorders, 
      these can be identified in tissue samples from postmortem brain and also during 
      life from skeletal or cardiac muscle samples. The mitochondrial abnormalities are 
      robust and reproducible. In the case of HD, it is uncertain how these 
      mitochondrial defects fit in the pathogenetic cascade. Studies are ongoing to 
      identify whether the respiratory-chain defect present in the brain is expressed 
      in skeletal muscle at the spectrophotometric level. The presence of a 
      bioenergetic defect as identified by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) 
      suggests that in HD expression of the mutant protein can exert an influence on 
      mitochondrial function in tissues outside the central nervous system (CNS). It 
      would appear that frataxin deficiency has a direct effect on mitochondrial 
      function, either through iron-sulfur cluster construction or through the 
      generation of free radicals. The identification these bioenergetic abnormalities 
      in these neurodegenerative disorders has opened up the prospect for the 
      development of disease-modifying therapies directed to the biochemical 
      abnormalities demonstrated. 31P-MRS studies have detected a deficit of in vivo 
      oxidative phosphorylation in the skeletal muscle of FRDA and HD patients and in 
      the myocardium of FRDA patients. In both FRDA and HD patients, a relationship 
      between the triplet repeat expansion and the extent of in vivo energy metabolism 
      deficit has been shown. The total safety of MRS scans makes them an ideal tool 
      for repeated assessments to monitor disease progression as well as the effect of 
      new therapies. This chapter describes useful methods for assessment of 
      mitochondrial function in vitro and in vivo.

TI  - Monitoring aggregate formation in organotypic slice cultures from transgenic 
      mice.
PG  - 161-71
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the first exon of the HD gene. It encodes a protein known as 
      huntingtin, which aggregates in the nuclei of affected neurons. These aggregates 
      are an obvious therapeutic target, thus an organotypic slice culture assay has 
      been designed to screen potential antiaggregation compounds using the R6/2 mouse 
      model of HD. This assay allows the aggregates to be fully quantified using 
      fluorescent confocal microscopy and gives additional information perturbing to 
      drug solubility, delivery, toxicity, concentration, and efficacy of inhibitors. 
      This information is essential to the planning and application of an in vivo drug 
      trial in the R6/2 mice.

TI  - Dendritic spine pathology and deficits in experience-dependent dendritic 
      plasticity in R6/1 Huntington's disease transgenic mice.
PG  - 2799-807
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion coding for an expanded polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin 
      protein. Dendritic abnormalities occur in human HD patients and in several 
      transgenic mouse models of the disease. In this study, we examine, for the first 
      time, dendrite and spine pathology in the R6/1 mouse model of HD, which mimics 
      neurodegeneration seen in human HD. Enriching the environment of HD transgenic 
      mice delays the onset of symptoms, so we also examine the effects of enrichment 
      on dendrite pathology. Golgi-impregnated tissue from symptomatic R6/1 HD mice 
      reveals a decrease in dendritic spine density and dendritic spine length in 
      striatal medium spiny neurons and cortical pyramidal neurons. HD also causes a 
      specific reduction in the proportion of bifurcated dendritic spines on basal 
      dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons. No differences in soma size, recurving 
      distal dendrites, or dendritic branching were observed. Although home-cage 
      environmental enrichment from 1 to 8 months of age increases spine density in 
      wild-type mice, it has no effect on the spine pathology in HD mice. These results 
      show that dendritic spine pathology in R6/1 HD mice resembles degenerative 
      changes seen in human HD and in other transgenic mouse models of the disease. We 
      thus provide further evidence that the HD mutation disrupts the connectivity in 
      both neostriatum and cerebral cortex, which will contribute to motor and 
      cognitive disease symptoms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Huntington's disease 
      pathology interferes with the normal plastic response of dendritic spines to 
      environmental enrichment.

TI  - Variants of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) significantly contribute to 
      hyperserotonemia in autism.
PG  - 264-71
AB  - The role of the serotonin system in the etiology and pathogenesis of autism 
      spectrum disorders (ASD) is not clearly defined. High levels of platelet 
      serotonin (5-HT) have been consistently found in a proportion of patients, and it 
      is known that specific 5-HT transporter gene (SLC6A4) variants modulate 
      transporter reuptake function, therefore possibly influencing the occurrence of 
      hyperserotonemia in a subset of autistic patients. We have examined the 
      association of platelet serotonin levels with two SLC6A4 polymorphisms, 5-HTT 
      gene-linked polymorphic region (HTTLPR) in the promoter and intron 2 variable 
      number of tandem repeats (VNTR), in a sample of 105 ASD patients, their parents, 
      and 52 control children. Quantitative transmission disequilibrium test (QTDT) 
      results showed a significant effect on 5-HT levels of each SLC6A4 marker (P=0.017 
      for HTTLPR; P=0.047 for intron 2 VNTR) and of haplotypes of the two markers 
      (P=0.017), with a major contribution of the L.Stin2.10 haplotype (P=0.0013). A 
      5-HT mean value in the range of hyperserotonemia was associated with the 
      homozygous L.Stin2.10 haplotype (H (1,N=97)=7.76, P=0.0054), which occurred in 
      33% of hyperserotonemic patients against 6% of patients with normal 5-HT levels 
      (Fisher's exact test: P=0.013, OR=8). Allele interaction at the HTTLPR locus was 
      found, with a significant dominance variance effect on 5-HT levels. We found no 
      transmission disequilibrium of any of the SLC6A4 variants in ASD. Our results 
      show that the SLC6A4 gene is a significant factor in the determination of 5-HT 
      levels, and that specific SLC6A4 variants are associated with an increased risk 
      for hyperserotonemia in our sample of autistic patients. The biological 
      mechanism, however, is unlikely to involve the SLC6A4 gene solely. The associated 
      SLC6A4 alleles likely interact with other genes or environmental factors to 
      produce the abnormally high 5-HT levels observed in this subset of autistic 
      patients, who possibly represent a separate etiological group.

TI  - Environmental enrichment rescues protein deficits in a mouse model of 
      Huntington's disease, indicating a possible disease mechanism.
PG  - 2270-6
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion encoding an extended polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin 
      protein. Transgenic mice expressing a human huntingtin transgene containing an 
      expanded CAG repeat (R6/1 model) develop a neurodegenerative disorder closely 
      resembling human HD. Previous work demonstrated that environmental enrichment 
      delays the onset of motor symptoms in this mouse model. We confirmed that at 5 
      months of age, enrichment ameliorates motor symptoms (assessed using the rotarod 
      test) and prevents loss of body weight induced by the HD transgene. We further 
      examined molecular consequences of enrichment by determining changes in protein 
      levels in the neostriatum, hippocampus, and anterior cortex using quantitative 
      Western blot analysis. Non-enriched HD mice have severe reductions in BDNF in the 
      hippocampus and striatum at 5 months, which are entirely rescued by enrichment. 
      BDNF levels are unaltered by HD in the anterior cortex, suggesting that 
      enrichment might prevent HD-induced impairment of anterograde transport of this 
      neurotrophin to the striatum. NGF is unaffected by HD. Non-enriched HD mice also 
      exhibit deficits in dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (32 kDa) in 
      striatum and anterior cortex. Environmental enrichment rescues the cortical but 
      not the striatal deficit at 5 months. These results suggest that environmental 
      enrichment benefits animals at early stages of the disease by rescuing protein 
      deficits, possibly through rescuing transcription or protein transport problems.

TI  - Redistribution of transcription start sites within the FMR1 promoter region with 
      expansion of the downstream CGG-repeat element.
PG  - 543-9
AB  - Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of mental impairment, is caused by 
      expansion of a (CGG)n trinucleotide repeat element located in the 5' untranslated 
      region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Repeat expansion is 
      known to influence both transcription and translation; however, the mechanisms by 
      which the CGG element exerts its effects are not known. In the current work, we 
      have utilized 5'-RLM-RACE to examine the influence of CGG repeat number on the 
      utilization of transcription start sites in normal (n<55) and premutation 
      (54<n<200) cell lines of both non-neural (lymphoblastoid) and neural (primary 
      astrocyte) origin. Our results demonstrate that, in both neural and non-neural 
      cells, transcription of the FMR1 gene is initiated from several transcription 
      start sites within a approximately 50 nt region that lies approximately 130 nt 
      upstream of the CGG repeat element. For normal alleles, most transcripts initiate 
      from the downstream-most start site, close to the single position identified 
      previously. Surprisingly, as the size of the CGG repeat expands into the 
      premutation range, initiation shifts to the upstream sites, suggesting that the 
      CGG element may act as a downstream enhancer/modulator of transcription. The 
      shift in start site selection for both neural and non-neural cells indicates that 
      the effect is general. Furthermore, the correspondence between start site 
      utilization and the degree of elevation of FMR1 mRNA suggests that a substantial 
      fraction of the increased message in the premutation range may derive from the 
      upstream start sites.

TI  - Serotonin transporter gene and autism: a haplotype analysis in an Irish autistic 
      population.
PG  - 587-93
AB  - The role of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) in the development of 
      neuropsychiatric disorders has been widely investigated. Two polymorphisms, an 
      insertion/deletion in the promoter region and a 12 repeat allele in a variable 
      nucleotide tandem repeat (VNTR) in intron 2, drive higher expression of the 5-HTT 
      gene. Four studies have shown nominally significant excess transmission of 
      alleles of the 5-HTT gene in autism, while three studies have reported no excess 
      transmission. This present study investigates the role of 5-HTT in the 
      genetically homogenous Irish population. In all, 84 families were genotyped for 
      five polymorphisms (three SNPs, a VNTR and an in/del). The analysis of allele 
      transmissions using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) was undertaken and 
      indicated preferential transmission of the short promoter allele (TDT 
      P-value=0.0334). Linkage disequilibrium between markers was calculated and 
      haplotypes were assessed for excess transmission and odds ratios (ORs) to 
      affected children. A number of haplotypes, especially those involving and 
      surrounding SNP10, showed evidence of association. The ORs ranged from 1.2 to 
      2.4. The most significant haplotype associated with transmission to affected 
      probands was the SNP10-VNTR-SNP18 haplotype (chi(2)=7.3023, P=0.0069, odds 
      ratio=1.8). This haplotype included the 12 repeat allele of the VNTR, which is 
      associated with increased expression and may play a subtle role in the early 
      development of the brain in affected probands.

TI  - Novel nuclear shuttle proteins, HDBP1 and HDBP2, bind to neuronal cell-specific 
      cis-regulatory element in the promoter for the human Huntington's disease gene.
PG  - 7275-86
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in exon 1 of the HD gene, and the expression level of either normal or 
      mutant huntingtin is implicated in the pathogenesis of HD. However, a molecular 
      base of the HD gene transcription has not been elucidated as yet. In this study, 
      we identified two proteins, HDBP1 and HDBP2, which bind to the promoter region 
      for the HD gene using a yeast one-hybrid system. Amino acid sequence analysis of 
      the proteins deduced the presence of nuclear localization signal, nuclear export 
      signal, zinc finger, serine/proline-rich region, and highly conserved C-terminal 
      region. In vitro DNA binding assay indicated that the C-terminal conserved 
      regions of the proteins were responsible for binding to the unique promoter DNA 
      sequences of the HD gene. The DNA sequence protected from DNase I digestion was a 
      7-bp consensus sequence (GCCGGCG), which resides in triplicate at intervals of 13 
      bp within and proximal to the 20-bp direct repeat sequences of the HD promoter 
      region. The mutation of 7-bp consensus sequence abolishes the HD promoter 
      function in a neuronal cell line (IMR32). In human cultured cells, ectopically 
      expressed green fluorescent protein-fused HDBP1 and HDBP2 localized in the 
      cytoplasm, but both proteins totally shift from cytoplasm to nucleus by the 
      treatment with an inhibitor of the nuclear export, leptomycin B, and mutagenesis 
      of the putative nuclear export signals. Taken together, HDBP1 and HDBP2 are novel 
      transcription factors shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm and bind to the 
      specific GCCGGCG, which is an essential cis-element for HD gene expression in 
      neuronal cells.

TI  - Polymorphisms within the promoter and the intron 2 of the serotonin transporter 
      gene in a population of bulimic patients.
PG  - 226-30
AB  - The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene is a firm candidate to explain eating 
      disorders. In this association study, two different polymorphisms were analysed: 
      a variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in intron 2 and a 
      deletion/insertion polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) in the promoter region. The hypothesis 
      that these gene polymorphisms may be a susceptibility factor in bulimia nervosa 
      (BN) was explored in a female population of 102 purgative bulimics. BN patients 
      who have suffered preceding anorexia nervosa (AN) episodes formed the so-called 
      previous AN bulimic patient group. In our sample of normal-eater controls and 
      purging type bulimics, regardless of whether or not the BN patients had suffered 
      prior AN episodes, no differences were found considering the frequencies of 
      genotypes, alleles or haplotypes of both polymorphic regions of the 5-HTT gene.

TI  - Association of the serotonin transporter gene with sudden infant death syndrome: 
      a haplotype analysis.
PG  - 238-45
AB  - Serotonergic receptor binding in the arcuate nucleus, n. raphe obscurus, and 
      other medullary regions is decreased in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) 
      cases. Further, an insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of the 
      serotonin transporter protein (5-HTT) gene has recently been associated with risk 
      of SIDS. This polymorphism differentially regulates 5-HTT expression, with the 
      long allele (L), the SIDS-associated allele, being a more effective promoter than 
      the short allele (S). To further elucidate the role of the 5-HTT gene in SIDS, we 
      investigated the 5-HTT intron 2 polymorphism, which also differentially regulates 
      5-HTT expression with the 12 repeat allele being the more effective promoter. In 
      a cohort of 90 SIDS cases (44 African-American and 46 Caucasian) and 
      gender/ethnicity-matched controls, significant positive associations were found 
      between SIDS and the intron 2 genotype distribution (P-value = 0.041) among 
      African-American SIDS vs. African-American controls, specifically with the 12/12 
      genotype (P-value = 0.03), and with the 12 repeat allele (P-value=0.018). The 
      frequency of the 12/12 genotype and 12-repeat allele was significantly different 
      (P < 0.001) between the African-American and Caucasian SIDS cases. Furthermore, 
      the promoter and intron 2 loci were in significant linkage disequilibrium, and 
      the L-12 haplotype was significantly associated with SIDS in the African-American 
      (P = 0.002) but not Caucasian (P = 0.117) subgroups. These results indicate a 
      relationship between SIDS and the 12-repeat allele of the intron 2 variable 
      number tandem repeat of the 5-HTT gene in African-Americans, and a significant 
      role of the haplotype containing the 12-repeat allele and the promoter L-allele 
      in defining SIDS risk in African-Americans. These data, if confirmed in larger 
      studies, may begin to explain the differences in SIDS incidence by ethnicity, 
      suggest a role for levels of 5-HTT expression in generation of SIDS 
      susceptibility, and provide an important tool for identifying at-risk individuals 
      and estimating the risk of recurrence.

TI  - Association study of serotonin transporter gene VNTR polymorphism and mood 
      disorders, onset age and suicide attempts in a Chinese sample.
PG  - 5-9
AB  - The human serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene is an important candidate for the 
      pathogenesis of mood disorders. Associations have been reported between a 
      variable-number tandem-repeat polymorphism in intron 2 of the serotonin 
      transporter gene (5-HTTVNTR) and mood disorders in a number of studies of Western 
      and Chinese populations. However, no such relationships have been determined in 
      other analogous research. To replicate these positive findings in a Chinese 
      population and to determine the association between onset age of bipolar disorder 
      and 5-HTTVNTR, we investigated the prevalence of this polymorphism in an 
      independent Chinese population (83 bipolar disorder patients, 77 major depressive 
      disorder patients and 169 controls), demonstrating no significant association 
      between the 5-HTTVNTR polymorphism and mood disorders or age at onset. Further, 
      no association was demonstrated between this polymorphism and suicidal history in 
      mood disorder patients. These negative findings suggest that 5-HTTVNTR does not 
      play a major role in the pathogenesis of mood disorder in Chinese populations.

TI  - DNA testing for Huntington disease in the Turkish population.
PG  - 20-4
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease, characterized 
      by involuntary movements, behavioral and personality changes and dementia. 
      Although the mean age at onset is about 40 years, onset varies from 5 to 79 
      years. Therefore, at-risk individuals are never sure to have escaped the disease. 
      The genetic defect is a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion at the 5' end of the 
      IT-15 gene on chromosome 4. In this study, we analyzed 127 patients with HD and 
      122 healthy controls. The numbers of CAG repeats varied from 38 to 78 (median: 
      42) in 127 HD patients, while in healthy controls we observed only 10-35 CAG 
      repeats (median: 18). The length of the CAG repeat expansion in Turkish HD 
      patients and normal controls was similar to that reported from other populations. 
      Negative correlations (r = -0.67) were also found between age of disease onset 
      and repeat length.

TI  - Huntington's disease-like phenotype due to trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 
      TBP and JPH3 genes.
PG  - 1599-603
AB  - We report a group of 252 patients with a Huntington's disease-like (HDL) 
      phenotype, including 60 with typical Huntington's disease, who had tested 
      negative for pathological expansions in the IT15 gene, the major mutation in 
      Huntington's disease. They were screened for repeat expansions in two other genes 
      involved in HDL phenotypes: those encoding the junctophilin-3 (JPH3/HDL2) and 
      prion (PRNP/HDL1) proteins. In addition, because of the clinical overlap between 
      patients with HDL disease and autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia or 
      dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), we investigated trinucleotide 
      repeat expansions in genes encoding the TATA-binding protein (TBP/SCA17) and 
      atrophin-1 (DRPLA). Two patients carried 43 and 50 uninterrupted CTG repeats in 
      the JPH3 gene. Two other patients had 44 and 46 CAA/CAG repeats in the TBP gene. 
      Patients with expansions in the TBP or JPH3 genes had HDL phenotypes 
      indistinguishable from Huntington's disease. Taking into account patients with 
      typical Huntington's disease, their frequencies were evaluated as 3% each in our 
      series of typical HDL patients. Interestingly, incomplete penetrance of the 46 
      CAA/CAG repeat in the TBP gene was observed in a 59-year-old transmitting, but 
      healthy, parent. Furthermore, we report a new configuration of the expanded TBP 
      allele, with 11 repeats on the first polymorphic stretch of CAGs. Expansions in 
      the DRPLA gene and insertions in the PRNP gene were not found in our group of 
      patients. Further genetic heterogeneity of the HDL phenotype therefore exists.

TI  - Huntingtin contains a highly conserved nuclear export signal.
PG  - 1393-403
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD), is a genetic neurodegenerative disease characterized 
      by a DNA CAG triplet repeat expansion in the first exon of the disease gene, HD. 
      CAG DNA expansion results in a polyglutamine tract expansion in mutant huntingtin 
      protein. Wild-type and mutant full-length huntingtin have been detected in the 
      nucleus, but elevated levels of mutant huntingtin and huntingtin amino-terminal 
      proteolytic fragments are seen to accumulate in the nuclei of HD-affected 
      neurons. The presence of huntingtin in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm 
      suggested that huntingtin may be dynamic between these compartments. By live cell 
      time-lapse video microscopy, we have been able to visualize 
      polyglutamine-mediated aggregation and the transient nuclear localization of 
      huntingtin over time in a striatal cell line. A classical nuclear localization 
      signal could not be detected in huntingtin, but we have discovered a nuclear 
      export signal (NES) in the carboxy-terminus of huntingtin. Leptomycin B treatment 
      of clonal striatal cells enhanced the nuclear localization of huntingtin, and a 
      mutant NES huntingtin displayed increased nuclear localization, indicating that 
      huntingtin can shuttle to and from the nucleus. The huntingtin NES is strictly 
      conserved among all huntingtin proteins from diverse species. This export signal 
      may be important in Huntington's disease because this fragment of huntingtin is 
      proteolytically cleaved away during HD. The huntingtin NES therefore defines a 
      potential role for huntingtin as a member of a nucleocytoplasmic dynamic protein 
      complex.

TI  - No evidence of association of two 5HT transporter gene polymorphisms and 
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 107-10
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Three studies to date have found evidence (or a trend for evidence) 
      of linkage and association between the long allele of the 44 base pair repeat 
      insertion/deletion 5-HTT functional polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) and attention deficit 
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In an attempt to replicate these findings, we 
      examined this polymorphism and a variable number tandem repeat in the second 
      intron of 5-HTT for association with ADHD. METHODS: One hundred and fifty 
      children who met diagnostic criteria for ADHD and their parents (where available) 
      were genotyped for these polymorphisms. Analysis was undertaken using the 
      transmission disequilibrium test and haplotype analysis, as well as case-control 
      comparisons using a control group of 121 individuals. RESULTS: No association 
      between either the 5-HTTLPR or the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) in ADHD 
      was found (extended transmission disequilibrium test; P=0.37 and P=0.62, 
      respectively). Haplotype analysis was also non-significant. Further analysis 
      revealed no evidence of association in the subgroups of those without conduct 
      disorder and in medication non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: Failure to replicate 
      findings from previous studies may be due to a lack of statistical power. 
      However, given recent findings by Kent et al. (2002) of association with another 
      polymorphism in the 5HTT gene, we hypothesise that previous positive findings may 
      have arisen by the LPR and VNTR being in linkage disequilibrium with the true 
      susceptibility polymorphism.

TI  - Interaction of Akt-phosphorylated ataxin-1 with 14-3-3 mediates neurodegeneration 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.
PG  - 457-68
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is one of several neurological disorders 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion. In SCA1, this expansion produces an abnormally 
      long polyglutamine tract in the protein ataxin-1. Mutant polyglutamine proteins 
      accumulate in neurons, inducing neurodegeneration, but the mechanism underlying 
      this accumulation has been unclear. We have discovered that the 14-3-3 protein, a 
      multifunctional regulatory molecule, mediates the neurotoxicity of ataxin-1 by 
      binding to and stabilizing ataxin-1, thereby slowing its normal degradation. The 
      association of ataxin-1 with 14-3-3 is regulated by Akt phosphorylation, and in a 
      Drosophila model of SCA1, both 14-3-3 and Akt modulate neurodegeneration. Our 
      finding that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling and 14-3-3 cooperate to 
      modulate the neurotoxicity of ataxin-1 provides insight into SCA1 pathogenesis 
      and identifies potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Raised intracellular glucose concentrations reduce aggregation and cell death 
      caused by mutant huntingtin exon 1 by decreasing mTOR phosphorylation and 
      inducing autophagy.
PG  - 985-94
AB  - Huntington's disease is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion that is 
      translated into an abnormally long polyglutamine tract. This gain-of-function 
      mutation is associated with huntingtin aggregation and cell death. Autophagy is 
      an important clearance route for mutant huntingtin exon 1. While mammalian target 
      of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of autophagy, the upstream modifiers of 
      this process are poorly understood. Our previous expression profiling studies in 
      HD cell models observed changes in four genes associated with glucose metabolism, 
      including the GLUT1 glucose transporter. A role for intracellular glucose as a 
      modulator for polyglutamine toxicity was suggested as cell death was reduced by 
      GLUT1 overexpression. Here we show that the protective effect of GLUT1 is 
      associated with decreased huntingtin exon 1 aggregation in cell models. 
      Consistent with this result, we also observed reduced aggregation and enhanced 
      clearance of mutant huntingtin when cells were cultured in raised glucose 
      concentrations (8 g/l). These effects were mimicked by 8 g/l 2-deoxyglucose 
      (2DOG) (transported, phosphorylated but not metabolized further), but not with 8 
      g/l 3-O-methyl glucose (transported but not metabolized further). Thus, this 
      phenomenon is probably mediated by glucose-6-phosphate. Increased clearance of 
      mutant huntingtin by raised glucose (8 g/l) and 2DOG correlated with increased 
      autophagy and reduced phosphorylation of mTOR, S6K1 and Akt. Thus, raised 
      intracellular glucose/glucose 6-phosphate levels reduce mutant huntingtin 
      toxicity by increasing autophagy via mTOR and possibly Akt. As mTOR and Akt 
      regulate a diversity of crucial cellular processes, our data also suggest a major 
      new set of targets for intracellular glucose signalling.

TI  - Developmental patterns of mucin gene expression in human fetal small intestinal 
      xenografts maintained in severe-combined immunodeficient mice.
PG  - 898-904
AB  - The lack of a suitable animal model that expresses human intestinal mucin genes 
      limits the study of mucin function. The aim of this study was to examine whether 
      human fetal intestinal xenografts, known to model host-restricted interactions 
      with human-specific pathogens, express mucin genes in an appropriate 
      developmental pattern when transplanted into severe-combined immunodeficient 
      (scid) mice. Expression profiles for eight mucin genes were examined in human 
      fetal ileal xenografts transplanted ectopically into scid mice for 10 wk. In situ 
      hybridization was performed on fetal, xenograft, and adult intestinal tissue 
      sections with 35S-labeled oligonucleotides specific to human tandem repeat 
      sequences for MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC5B, MUC6, and MUC7. 
      Hybridization patterns observed with the MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, and MUC5AC probes 
      demonstrated that mucin gene expression in xenografted fetal intestine was 
      comparable to third trimester fetal and/or adult tissues. MUC2 and MUC5AC were 
      expressed in a developmental-specific fashion. MUC5AC, expressed in first and 
      early second trimester fetal bowel, was never detected in intestinal xenografts. 
      MUC2 expression displayed a late fetal and/or adult-type hybridization pattern. 
      MUC3 and MUC4 were not developmentally expressed. Appropriate developmental 
      regulation of known intestinal mucin genes was recorded in ectopically grafted 
      human fetal intestinal xenografts. Adult-like patterns of mucin gene expression 
      in this model system will permit future studies aimed at characterizing 
      cis/trans-acting factors that regulate mucin gene expression and function during 
      development, disease, and wound healing and also in mucin-pathogen interactions 
      during host defense.

TI  - Sudden infant death syndrome: association with a promoter polymorphism of the 
      serotonin transporter gene.
PG  - 268-74
AB  - Serotonergic receptor binding in the arcuate nucleus, n. raphe obscurus, and 
      other medullary regions is decreased in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) 
      cases. Further, a variable tandem repeat sequence polymorphism in the promoter 
      region of the serotonin transporter protein (5-HTT) gene has recently been 
      associated with risk of SIDS in a Japanese cohort. This polymorphism 
      differentially regulates 5-HTT expression, with the long allele (L), the 
      SIDS-associated allele, being a more effective promoter than the short allele 
      (S). We therefore investigated the 5-HTT promoter polymorphism in a cohort of 87 
      SIDS cases (43 African American and 44 Caucasian) and gender/ethnicity-matched 
      controls. Significant positive associations were found between SIDS and the 5-HTT 
      genotype distribution (P = 0.022), specifically with the L/L genotype (P = 
      0.048), and between SIDS and the 5-HTT L allele (P = 0.005). There was also a 
      significant negative association between SIDS and the S/S genotype (P = 0.011). 
      The comparisons were repeated in the African American and Caucasian subgroups. 
      The data patterns were consistent in the subgroups, i.e., the L/L genotype and L 
      allele were increased in the cases, but not all subgroup comparisons were 
      statistically significant. These results indicate a relationship between SIDS and 
      the L allele of the 5-HTT gene in African Americans and Caucasians, and if 
      confirmed, will provide an important tool for identifying at-risk individuals and 
      estimating the risk of recurrence.

TI  - Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, ameliorates 
      motor deficits in a mouse model of Huntington's disease.
PG  - 2041-6
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited, progressive neurological disorder that 
      is caused by a CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion and for which there is no 
      effective therapy. Recent evidence indicates that transcriptional dysregulation 
      may contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of this disease. Supporting this 
      view, administration of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors has been shown to 
      rescue lethality and photoreceptor neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of 
      polyglutamine disease. To further explore the therapeutic potential of HDAC 
      inhibitors, we have conducted preclinical trials with suberoylanilide hydroxamic 
      acid (SAHA), a potent HDAC inhibitor, in the R6/2 HD mouse model. We show that 
      SAHA crosses the blood-brain barrier and increases histone acetylation in the 
      brain. We found that SAHA could be administered orally in drinking water when 
      complexed with cyclodextrins. SAHA dramatically improved the motor impairment in 
      R6/2 mice, clearly validating the pursuit of this class of compounds as HD 
      therapeutics.

TI  - Mismatch repair gene Msh2 modifies the timing of early disease in Hdh(Q111) 
      striatum.
PG  - 273-81
AB  - Somatic instability of expanded HD CAG repeats that encode the polyglutamine 
      tract in mutant huntingtin has been implicated in the striatal selectivity of 
      Huntington's disease (HD) pathology. Here in Hdh(Q111) mice, we have tested 
      whether a genetic background deficient in Msh2, expected to eliminate the 
      unstable behavior of the 109 CAG array inserted into the murine HD gene, would 
      alter the timing or striatal specificity of a dominant disease phenotype that 
      predicts late-onset neurodegeneration. Our analyses of Hdh(Q111/+):Msh2(+/+) and 
      Hdh(Q111/+): Msh2(-/-) progeny revealed that, while inherited instability 
      involved Msh2-dependent and -independent mechanisms, lack of Msh2 was sufficient 
      to abrogate progressive HD CAG repeat expansion in striatum. The absence of Msh2 
      also eliminated striatal mutant huntingtin with somatically expanded glutamine 
      tracts and caused an approximately 5 month delay in nuclear mutant protein 
      accumulation, but did not alter the striatal specificity of this early phenotype. 
      Thus, somatic HD CAG instability appears to be a consequence of a 
      striatal-selective disease process that accelerates the timing of an early 
      disease phenotype, via expansion of the glutamine tract in mutant huntingtin. 
      Therefore Msh2, as a striking modifier of early disease onset in a precise 
      genetic HD mouse model, provides a novel target for the development of 
      pharmacological agents that aim to slow pathogenesis in man.

TI  - Unilateral transplantation of human primary fetal tissue in four patients with 
      Huntington's disease: NEST-UK safety report ISRCTN no 36485475.
PG  - 678-85
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited autosomal dominant 
      condition in which there is a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene of 36 
      or more. Patients display progressive motor, cognitive, and behavioural 
      deterioration associated with progressive cell loss and atrophy in the striatum. 
      Currently there are no disease modifying treatments and current symptomatic 
      treatments are only partially effective in the early to moderate stages. Neural 
      transplantation is effective in animal models of HD and offers a potential 
      strategy for brain repair in patients. The authors report a safety study of 
      unilateral transplantation of human fetal striatal tissue into the striatum of 
      four patients with HD. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Stereotaxic placements of cell 
      suspensions of human fetal ganglionic eminence were made unilaterally into the 
      striatum of four patients with early to moderate HD. All patients received 
      immunotherapy with cyclosporin A, azathioprine, and prednisolone for at least six 
      months postoperatively. Patients were assessed for safety of the procedure using 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), regular recording of serum biochemistry and 
      haematology to monitor immunotherapy, and clinical assessment according to the 
      Core Assessment Protocol For Intrastriatal Transplantation in HD (CAPIT-HD). 
      RESULTS: During the six month post-transplantation period, the only adverse 
      events related to the procedure were associated with the immunotherapy. MRI 
      demonstrated tissue at the site of implantation, but there was no sign of tissue 
      overgrowth. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the procedure accelerated the 
      course of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral transplantation of human fetal 
      striatal tissue in patients with HD is safe and feasible. Assessment of efficacy 
      will require longer follow up in a larger number of patients.

TI  - A detailed physical map of the 6p reading disability locus, including new markers 
      and confirmation of recombination suppression.
PG  - 339-49
AB  - Loci for several complex disorders have been genetically linked to markers 
      located telomeric of the HLA class I region of the major histocompatibility 
      complex on 6p21.3-22. However, this same region has been characterized by a large 
      interval of recombination suppression with the potential to greatly complicate 
      precise localization of these risk loci. Furthermore, a paucity of markers and 
      physical mapping data has confounded precise localization of the boundaries of 
      linkage and recombination suppression. In order to create a more detailed marker 
      map of this region and define these boundaries we generated a minimal tiling 
      pathway of BACs, PACs, and cosmids and a multiplexed panel of 29 short tandem 
      repeat markers spanning 10 Mb. In addition to providing precise marker order and 
      distances, the pathway and marker panel frame an inversion of recombination 
      frequency that has distorted the resolution of linkage studies for 6p loci such 
      as reading disability and others, and that should be accounted for in the design 
      of future studies.

TI  - Early motor dysfunction and striosomal distribution of huntingtin microaggregates 
      in Huntington's disease knock-in mice.
PG  - 8266-76
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is characterized by a progressive loss of neurons in 
      the striatum and cerebral cortex and is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the 
      gene encoding huntingtin. Mice with the mutation inserted into their own 
      huntingtin gene (knock-in mice) are, genetically, the best models of the human 
      disease. Here we show for the first time that knock-in mice with 94 CAG repeats 
      develop a robust and early motor phenotype at 2 months of age, characterized by 
      increased rearing at night. This initial increase in repetitive movements was 
      followed by decreased locomotion at 4 and 6 months, despite a normal life span. 
      The decrease in striatal enkephalin mRNA that is known to occur at 4 months was 
      not present at 2 months, when increased rearing was observed. Both the 
      hyperactive and hypoactive phases of motor dysfunction preceded the detection of 
      nuclear microaggregates of mutated huntingtin in striatal neurons. Nuclear 
      microaggregates, defined as small huntingtin-positive punctas detected by light 
      microscopy, were very rare at 4 months but became widely distributed in striatal 
      neurons at 6 months. Nuclear inclusions did not appear until 18 months. When 
      present, nuclear microaggregates predominated in the striosomal compartment of 
      the striatum, providing a possible explanation for the different neuronal 
      vulnerability of striatal compartments observed in humans. The early motor 
      phenotype observed in the knock-in mouse is reminiscent of repetitive movements 
      often observed in early HD and provides a novel opportunity to assess the ability 
      of therapies to prevent the initial effects of the mutation in vivo.

TI  - Major psychiatric disorders and the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4): 
      family-based association studies.
PG  - 137-41
AB  - The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is a suitable candidate gene to test for 
      involvement in the pathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders. We used the 
      method of family-based controls to test for association between disease and a 
      variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) in intron 2 of the gene, which has received 
      support for involvement in the pathogenesis of several psychiatric disorders. We 
      analysed 413 proband-parent trios of Bulgarian origin: 266 had a schizophrenic 
      proband, 103 had a bipolar proband and 44 had a schizoaffective proband. The 
      results were analysed using the extended transmission disequilibrium test. 
      Possible effects of different alleles on certain clinical variables were examined 
      by correlation analysis. Three alleles were detected: STin2.9, STin2.10 and 
      STin2.12. None of the three diagnostic samples showed preferential transmission 
      of alleles that reached conventional levels of statistical significance. We could 
      not confirm previous results that STin2.12 allele increases susceptibility to 
      bipolar disorder type I. The rare STin2.9 showed a non-significant trend for 
      preferential transmission in the sample as a whole: 18 transmitted versus 11 
      non-transmitted (P = 0.2). The VNTR polymorphism in the 5-HTT gene does not 
      appear to be a major risk factor for increasing susceptibility to major 
      psychiatric disorders.

TI  - No association between the serotonergic polymorphisms and incidence of nausea 
      induced by fluvoxamine treatment.
PG  - 477-81
AB  - We investigated the association between serotonergic polymorphisms and incidence 
      of nausea, which is the most frequent side-effect of selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibiters (SSRIs), in 66 patients treated with fluvoxamine in a 
      protocolized-dosing method. We focused on three polymorphisms of serotonin (5-HT) 
      neuronal systems such as 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) gene-linked polymorphic region 
      (5-HTTLPR), a variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in the second 
      intron of the 5-HTT gene (STin2) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) gene 
      polymorphism in intron 7 (TPH-A218C), which have been reported to possess 
      positive association with treatment response to SSRIs. In addition to this, the 
      relationship between development of nausea and treatment response was also 
      analyzed. Results suggested that these three polymorphisms did not affect the 
      development of fluvoxamine-induced nausea, and that incidence of nausea was not a 
      phenomenon that predicts the treatment response to fluvoxamine.

TI  - Counting CAG repeats in the Huntington's disease gene by restriction endonuclease 
      EcoP15I cleavage.
PG  - e83
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with 
      autosomal-dominant inheritance. The disease is caused by a CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion located in the first exon of the HD gene. The CAG repeat is 
      highly polymorphic and varies from 6 to 37 repeats on chromosomes of unaffected 
      individuals and from more than 30 to 180 repeats on chromosomes of HD patients. 
      In this study, we show that the number of CAG repeats in the HD gene can be 
      determined by restriction of the DNA with the endonuclease EcoP15I and subsequent 
      analysis of the restriction fragment pattern by electrophoresis through 
      non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels using the ALFexpress DNA Analysis System. CAG 
      repeat numbers in the normal (30 and 35 repeats) as well as in the pathological 
      range (81 repeats) could be accurately counted using this assay. Our results 
      suggest that this high-resolution method can be used for the exact length 
      determination of CAG repeats in HD genes as well as in genes affected in related 
      CAG repeat disorders.

TI  - Mutation analysis and association studies of the ubiquitin carboxy-terminal 
      hydrolase L1 gene in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 1-4
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is attributed to a triplet CAG repeat mutation, and 
      about 70% of the variance in age-at-onset can be explained by the size of the 
      repeat expansion. Among potential candidates as modifier genes, we investigated 
      the role of ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) gene. We examined 
      the association of HD with the I93M mutation and S18Y polymorphism in 138 HD 
      patients and 136 control subjects, but we did not identify the I93M mutation. The 
      S18Y polymorphism was present in 17% of HD patients. Of the variance in the 
      age-at-onset that was not accounted for by the CAG repeat, 13% could be 
      attributed to S18Y polymorphism. We sequenced the entire coding region of the 
      UCH-L1 gene in seven HD patients with unexplained older or younger onset age. The 
      S18Y polymorphism was found in three out of the four patients presenting with a 
      later age-at-onset. We conclude that the UCH-L1 gene may be a genetic factor that 
      influences the variability in age-at-onset of HD.

TI  - Significance of serotonin transporter gene 5-HTTLPR and variable number of tandem 
      repeat polymorphism in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 176-81
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between attention 
      deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and polymorphism of the two regions of the 
      5-HTT gene [variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) and 5-HTTLRR] in a sample of 
      Turkish children. Using the PCR technique, these polymorphisms were assessed in 
      71 patients with ADHD and 128 healthy controls. The 5-HTTLPR S/S genotype was 
      significantly lower in the patients than in the controls (p = 0.018). Homozygous 
      and heterozygous L variant predominated in the ADHD group. But the VNTR 
      STin2.12/12 genotype was significantly less found in the patients than in the 
      controls (p = 0.001). There was no significant difference between the frequency 
      of the short (S), long, 10, and 12 alleles of both groups. The lack of an S/S 
      variant of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism of the STin2.12/12 variant of VNTR polymorphism 
      appears to be associated with an increased risk of ADHD.

TI  - Presence of large deletions in kindreds with autism.
PG  - 100-15
AB  - Autism is caused, in part, by inheritance of multiple interacting susceptibility 
      alleles. To identify these inherited factors, linkage analysis of multiplex 
      families is being performed on a sample of 105 families with two or more affected 
      sibs. Segregation patterns of short tandem repeat polymorphic markers from four 
      chromosomes revealed null alleles at four marker sites in 12 families that were 
      the result of deletions ranging in size from 5 to >260 kb. In one family, a 
      deletion at marker D7S630 was complex, with two segments deleted (37 kb and 18 
      kb) and two retained (2,836 bp and 38 bp). Three families had deletions at 
      D7S517, with each family having a different deletion (96 kb, 183 kb, and >69 kb). 
      Another three families had deletions at D8S264, again with each family having a 
      different deletion, ranging in size from <5.9 kb to >260 kb. At a fourth marker, 
      D8S272, a 192-kb deletion was found in five families. Unrelated subjects and 
      additional families without autism were screened for deletions at these four 
      sites. Families screened included 40 families from Centre d'Etude du 
      Polymorphisme Humaine and 28 families affected with learning disabilities. 
      Unrelated samples were 299 elderly control subjects, 121 younger control 
      subjects, and 248 subjects with Alzheimer disease. The deletion allele at D8S272 
      was found in all populations screened. For the other three sites, no additional 
      deletions were identified in any of the groups without autism. Thus, these 
      deletions appear to be specific to autism kindreds and are potential 
      autism-susceptibility alleles. An alternative hypothesis is that 
      autism-susceptibility alleles elsewhere cause the deletions detected here, 
      possibly by inducing errors during meiosis.

TI  - Association for serotonin transporter gene variable number tandem repeat 
      polymorphism and schizophrenic disorders.
PG  - 131-3
AB  - In contrast with two previous western reports, a recent study on a Chinese 
      population found an association for allele 12 of the variable number tandem 
      repeat (VNTR) in the second intron of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene and 
      schizophrenic disorders. We have replicated this finding for a Chinese population 
      in Taiwan (114 schizophrenic patients and 127 controls), demonstrating a modest 
      but significant statistical association for the 5-HTT-VNTR allele 12 and 
      schizophrenic patients (one-sided p = 0.043). This positive finding further 
      supports the proposition that the 5-HTT-VNTR allele 12 is a risk factor for 
      schizophrenic disorders in Chinese populations, although the effect is weak.

TI  - Correlation between serotonin uptake in human blood platelets with the 44-bp 
      polymorphism and the 17-bp variable number of tandem repeat of the serotonin 
      transporter.
PG  - 323-8
AB  - Dysfunctions of the central serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) system seem to 
      be associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or depression. 
      Previous studies suggested that a 44-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism of the 
      5-HT transporter (5-HTT) promoter region might influence the transcriptional 
      activity of the 5-HTT gene, and the insertion variant resulted in increased 5-HTT 
      expression and 5-HT uptake. Moreover, a 17-bp variable number of tandem repeat 
      (VNTR) polymorphism of the second intron may act as a transcriptional regulator 
      with allele dependent differential enhancer-like properties. Since the 5-HTT of 
      human platelets shares many properties with the transporter of neural tissue, 
      platelets are widely used as a surrogate tissue source, possibly reflecting 
      central 5-HT metabolism. Therefore, we investigated the impact of the 44-bp 
      polymorphism and the 17-bp VNTR for 5-HT uptake in platelets of 50 male subjects. 
      We found no significant effect of the 44-bp polymorphism and of the 17-bp VNTR on 
      maximum rate (Vmax) of 5-HT uptake. However, individuals homozygous for the 5-HTT 
      intron 2 allele with 12 repeats (STin2.12) of the 17-bp VNTR appeared to have 
      lower affinity of 5-HT uptake than individuals heterozygous for the 
      STin2.10/STin2.9 allele. This was also observed for the combined analysis of both 
      polymorphisms. In conclusion, we found no association between the different 
      genotypes of the 44-bp polymorphism and the 17-bp VNTR and maximum rate of 5-HT 
      uptake into platelets.

TI  - Transmission disequilibrium mapping at the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) 
      region in autistic disorder.
PG  - 278-88
AB  - The serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4, MIM 182138) is a candidate gene in 
      autistic disorder based on neurochemical, neuroendocrine studies and the efficacy 
      of potent serotonin transporter inhibitors in reducing ritualistic behaviors and 
      related aggression. An insertion/deletion polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) in the promoter 
      region and a variable number of tandem repeat polymorphism (VNTR) in the second 
      intron, were previously identified and suggested to modulate transcription. Six 
      previous family-based association studies of SLC6A4 in autistic disorder have 
      been conducted, with four studies showing nominally significant transmission 
      disequilibrium and two studies with no evidence of nominally significant 
      transmission disequilibrium. In the present study, TDT was conducted in 81 new 
      trios. A previous finding of transmission disequilibrium between a haplotype 
      consisting of the 5-HTTLPR and intron 2 VNTR was replicated in this study, but 
      not preferential transmission of 5-HTTLPR as an independent marker. Because of 
      inconsistent transmission of 5-HTTLPR across studies, SLC6A4 and its flanking 
      regions were sequenced in 10 probands, followed by typing of 20 single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) and seven simple sequence repeat (SSR) polymorphisms in 115 
      autism trios. When individual markers were analyzed by TDT, seven SNP markers and 
      four SSR markers (six SNPs, 5-HTTLPR and the second intron VNTR from promoter 1A 
      through intron 2 of SLC6A4, one SSR from intron 7 of SLC6A4, one SNP from the 
      bleomycin hydrolase gene (BLMH, MIM 602403) and one SSR telomeric to BLMH) showed 
      nominally significant evidence of transmission disequilibrium. Four markers 
      showed stronger evidence of transmission disequilibrium (TDT(max) P = 0.0005) 
      than 5-HTTLPR.

TI  - CAG/CTG repeat expansions at the Huntington's disease-like 2 locus are rare in 
      Huntington's disease patients.
PG  - 965-7
AB  - The authors report a large series of patients with Huntington disease (HD)-like 
      phenotype without CAG repeat expansions in the IT15 gene that were screened for 
      the newly identified CAG/CTG expansion in the gene encoding junctophilin-3. 
      Normal alleles in controls had from 8 to 28 repeats. A single patient of North 
      African origin with typical HD carried an allele with 50 uninterrupted repeats, 
      representing approximately 2% of the non-IT15 HD patients tested. Therefore, 
      further genetic heterogeneity is expected in HD.

TI  - Is the 31 CAG repeat allele of the spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) gene locus 
      non-specifically associated with trinucleotide expansion diseases?
PG  - 201-5
AB  - A number of human hereditary neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders are 
      caused by the expansion of trinucleotide repeats within certain genes. The 
      molecular mechanisms that underlie these expansions are not yet known. We have 
      analyzed six trinucleotide repeat-containing loci [spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, 
      SCA3, SCA8), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), Huntington chorea (HD) 
      and fragile X syndrome (FRAXA)] in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients (n = 
      52). As controls, we analyzed two groups of subjects: healthy control subjects (n 
      =133), and a group of patients with non-triplet neuromuscular diseases (n = 68) 
      caused by point mutations, deletions or duplications (spinal muscular atrophy, 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 1A, hereditary neuropathy with liability to 
      pressure palsies, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy). Allele frequency 
      distributions for all tested loci were similar in these three groups with the 
      exception of the SCA1 locus. In DM1 patients, the SCA1 allele with 31 CAG repeats 
      account for 40.4% of all chromosomes tested, which is significantly higher than 
      in two other groups (11.3% in healthy controls and 6.6% in the group of 
      non-triplet diseased patients; P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). This is 
      consistent with our previous findings in HD patients. The absence of this 
      association in non-triplet diseases as well as in healthy controls could indicate 
      a possible role of this SCA1 allele with 31 repeats in triplet diseases. Here we 
      discuss a possible role of the SCA1 region in pathological trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions.

TI  - A disorder similar to Huntington's disease is associated with a novel CAG repeat 
      expansion.
PG  - 373-80
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by 
      abnormalities of movement, cognition, and emotion and selective atrophy of the 
      striatum and cerebral cortex. While the etiology of HD is known to be a CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion, the pathways by which this mutation causes HD 
      pathology remain unclear. We now report a large pedigree with an autosomal 
      dominant disorder that is clinically similar to HD and that arises from a 
      different CAG expansion mutation. The disorder is characterized by onset in the 
      fourth decade, involuntary movements and abnormalities of voluntary movement, 
      psychiatric symptoms, weight loss, dementia, and a relentless course with death 
      about 20 years after disease onset. Brain magnetic resonance imaging scans and an 
      autopsy revealed marked striatal atrophy and moderate cortical atrophy, with 
      striatal neurodegeneration in a dorsal to ventral gradient and occasional 
      intranuclear inclusions. All tested affected individuals, and no tested 
      unaffecteds, have a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion of 50 to 60 triplets, as 
      determined by the repeat expansion detection assay. Tests for the HD expansion, 
      for all other known CAG expansion mutations, and for linkage to chromosomes 20p 
      and 4p were negative, indicating that this mutation is novel. Cloning the 
      causative CAG expansion mutation for this new disease, which we have termed 
      Huntington's disease-like 2, may yield valuable insight into the pathogenesis of 
      HD and related disorders.

TI  - Inhibition of polyglutamine aggregation in R6/2 HD brain slices-complex 
      dose-response profiles.
PG  - 1017-26
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a late onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      CAG/polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion. PolyQ aggregates can be detected in 
      the nuclei and processes of neurons in HD patients and mouse models prior to the 
      onset of symptoms. The misfolding and aggregation pathway is an important 
      therapeutic target. To better test the efficacy of aggregation inhibitors, we 
      have developed an organotypic slice culture system. We show here that the 
      formation of polyQ aggregates in hippocampal slices established from the R6/2 
      mouse follows the same prescribed sequence as occurs in vivo. Using this assay, 
      we show that Congo red and chrysamine G can modulate aggregate formation, but 
      show complex dose-response curves. Oral administration of creatine has been shown 
      to delay the onset of all aspects of the phenotype and neuropathology in R6/2 
      mice. We show here that creatine can similarly inhibit aggregate formation in the 
      slice culture assay.

TI  - Centrosome disorganization in fibroblast cultures derived from R6/2 Huntington's 
      disease (HD) transgenic mice and HD patients.
PG  - 2425-35
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurological disorder caused by a 
      CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion. We have previously generated the R6/2 mouse 
      model that expresses exon 1 of the human HD gene containing CAG repeats in excess 
      of 150. These mice develop a progressive neurological phenotype with a rapid 
      onset and progression. We show here that it is impossible to establish fibroblast 
      lines from these mice at 12 weeks of age, whilst this can be achieved without 
      difficulty at 6 and 9 weeks. Cultures derived from mice at 12 weeks contained a 
      high frequency of dysmorphic cells, including cells with an aberrant nuclear 
      morphology and a high frequency of micronuclei and large vacuoles. All of these 
      features were also present in a line derived from a juvenile HD patient. 
      Fibroblast lines derived from R6/2 mice and from HD patients were found to have a 
      high frequency of multiple centrosomes which could account for all of the 
      observed phenotypes including a reduced mitotic index, high frequency of 
      aneuploidy and persistence of the midbody. We were unable to detect large 
      insoluble polyglutamine aggregates in either the mouse or human lines. We have 
      identified a novel progressive HD pathology that occurs in cells of non-central 
      nervous system origin. An investigation of the pathological consequences of the 
      HD mutation in these cells will provide insight into cellular basis of the 
      disease.

TI  - Matroshka and ectopic polymorphisms: Two new classes of DNA sequence variation

PG  - 422-34
AB  - Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) is an orofacial clefting disorder with an autosomal 
      dominant pattern of inheritance. In our efforts to clone the VWS gene, 900 kb of 
      genomic sequence from the VWS candidate region at chromosome 1q32-q41 was 
      analyzed for new DNA sequence variants. We observed that in clone CTA-321i20 a 
      7922 bp sequence is absent relative to the sequence present in PAC clone 
      RP4-782d21 at positions 1669-9590, suggesting the presence of a 
      deletion/insertion (del/ins) polymorphism. Embedded in this 7922 bp region was a 
      TTCC short tandem repeat (STR). Genotype analysis showed that both the internal 
      STR and the (del/ins) mutation were true polymorphisms. This is a novel example 
      of intraallelic variation, a polymorphism within a polymorphism, and we suggest 
      that it be termed a "Matroshka" polymorphism. Further genetic and DNA sequence 
      analysis indicated that the ancestral state of the 1669-9590 del/ins polymorphism 
      was the insertion allele and that the original deletion mutation probably 
      occurred only once. A second class of novel DNA sequence variation was discovered 
      on chromosome 5 that shared a 328 bp identical sequence with this region on 
      chromosome 1. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was detected by SSCP using a 
      pair of primers derived from the chromosome 1 sequence. Surprisingly, these 
      primers also amplified the identical locus on chromosome 5, and the SNP was only 
      located on chromosome 5. Since the probe unexpectedly detected alleles from 
      another locus, we suggest that this type of sequence variant be termed an 
      "ectopic" polymorphism. These two novel classes of DNA sequence polymorphisms 
      have the potential to confound genetic and DNA sequence analysis and may also 
      contribute to variation in disease phenotypes.

TI  - Histone deacetylase inhibitors arrest polyglutamine-dependent neurodegeneration 
      in Drosophila.
PG  - 739-43
AB  - Proteins with expanded polyglutamine repeats cause Huntington's disease and other 
      neurodegenerative diseases. Transcriptional dysregulation and loss of function of 
      transcriptional co-activator proteins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of 
      these diseases. Huntington's disease is caused by expansion of a repeated 
      sequence of the amino acid glutamine in the abnormal protein huntingtin (Htt). 
      Here we show that the polyglutamine-containing domain of Htt, Htt exon 1 protein 
      (Httex1p), directly binds the acetyltransferase domains of two distinct proteins: 
      CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF). In cell-free 
      assays, Httex1p also inhibits the acetyltransferase activity of at least three 
      enzymes: p300, P/CAF and CBP. Expression of Httex1p in cultured cells reduces the 
      level of the acetylated histones H3 and H4, and this reduction can be reversed by 
      administering inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC). In vivo, HDAC inhibitors 
      arrest ongoing progressive neuronal degeneration induced by polyglutamine repeat 
      expansion, and they reduce lethality in two Drosophila models of polyglutamine 
      disease. These findings raise the possibility that therapy with HDAC inhibitors 
      may slow or prevent the progressive neurodegeneration seen in Huntington's 
      disease and other polyglutamine-repeat diseases, even after the onset of 
      symptoms.

TI  - Huntington disease phenocopy is a familial prion disease.
PG  - 1385-8
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a common autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease 
      with early adult-onset motor abnormalities and dementia. Many studies of HD show 
      that huntingtin (CAG)n repeat-expansion length is a sensitive and specific marker 
      for HD. However, there are a significant number of examples of HD in the absence 
      of a huntingtin (CAG)n expansion, suggesting that mutations in other genes can 
      provoke HD-like disorders. The identification of genes responsible for these 
      "phenocopies" may greatly improve the reliability of genetic screens for HD and 
      may provide further insight into neurodegenerative disease. We have examined an 
      HD phenocopy pedigree with linkage to chromosome 20p12 for mutations in the prion 
      protein (PrP) gene (PRNP). This reveals that affected individuals are 
      heterozygous for a 192-nucleotide (nt) insertion within the PrP coding region, 
      which encodes an expanded PrP with eight extra octapeptide repeats. This reveals 
      that this HD phenocopy is, in fact, a familial prion disease and that PrP 
      repeat-expansion mutations can provoke an HD "genocopy." PrP repeat expansions 
      are well characterized and provoke early-onset, slowly progressive atypical prion 
      diseases with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and a remarkable range 
      of clinical features, many of which overlap with those of HD. This observation 
      raises the possibility that an unknown number of HD phenocopies are, in fact, 
      familial prion diseases and argues that clinicians should consider screening for 
      PrP mutations in individuals with HD-like diseases in which the characteristic HD 
      (CAG)n repeat expansions are absent.

TI  - Impaired glutamate uptake in the R6 Huntington's disease transgenic mice.
PG  - 807-21
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disease for which the 
      mutation is CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion. The R6 mouse lines expressing the 
      HD mutation develop a movement disorder that is preceded by the formation of 
      neuronal polyglutamine aggregates. The phenotype is likely caused by a widespread 
      neuronal dysfunction, whereas neuronal cell death occurs late and is very 
      selective. We show that a decreased mRNA level of the major astroglial glutamate 
      transporter (GLT1) in the striatum and cortex of these mice is accompanied by a 
      concomitant decrease in glutamate uptake. In contrast, the expression of the 
      glutamate transporters, GLAST and EAAC1, remain unchanged. The mRNA level of the 
      astroglial enzyme glutamine synthetase is also decreased. These changes in 
      expression occur prior to any evidence of neurodegeneration and suggest that a 
      defect in astrocytic glutamate uptake may contribute to the phenotype and 
      neuronal cell death in HD.

TI  - A cloning strategy for identification of genes containing trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions.
PG  - 427-31
AB  - Until today, nineteen trinucleotide repeat expansions larger than forty repeat 
      copies have been found in the human genome. Of these, the CAG/CTG repeat is 
      predominant motif with twelve loci identified, ten of which have been associated 
      with the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We have developed a cloning 
      approach which isolates disease genes containing trinucleotide repeat expansions. 
      The method is based on size separation of genomic fragments, followed by 
      subcloning and library hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe. Fractions and 
      clones containing expanded repeats are identified by the repeat expansion 
      detection (RED) method throughout the cloning procedure. Large family materials 
      are not required and as little as 10 microg genomic DNA from a single individual 
      is sufficient for this method. Using this strategy we have cloned two DNA 
      fragments containing expanded repeats from two unrelated patients with a clinical 
      diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia. Sequencing of the two fragments showed sequence 
      identities with two disease genes, the Huntington gene and the ataxin 3 gene, 
      respectively. The method should be adaptable to the cloning of any long repeat 
      motif in any species. Furthermore the experimental steps can be performed in less 
      than a month, making it very effective and time efficient to disease gene 
      identification.

TI  - A disorder similar to Huntington's disease is associated with a novel CAG repeat 
      expansion.
PG  - 373-80
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by 
      abnormalities of movement, cognition, and emotion and selective atrophy of the 
      striatum and cerebral cortex. While the etiology of HD is known to be a CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion, the pathways by which this mutation causes HD 
      pathology remain unclear. We now report a large pedigree with an autosomal 
      dominant disorder that is clinically similar to HD and that arises from a 
      different CAG expansion mutation. The disorder is characterized by onset in the 
      fourth decade, involuntary movements and abnormalities of voluntary movement, 
      psychiatric symptoms, weight loss, dementia, and a relentless course with death 
      about 20 years after disease onset. Brain magnetic resonance imaging scans and an 
      autopsy revealed marked striatal atrophy and moderate cortical atrophy, with 
      striatal neurodegeneration in a dorsal to ventral gradient and occasional 
      intranuclear inclusions. All tested affected individuals, and no tested 
      unaffecteds, have a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion of 50 to 60 triplets, as 
      determined by the repeat expansion detection assay. Tests for the HD expansion, 
      for all other known CAG expansion mutations, and for linkage to chromosomes 20p 
      and 4p were negative, indicating that this mutation is novel. Cloning the 
      causative CAG expansion mutation for this new disease, which we have termed 
      Huntington's disease-like 2, may yield valuable insight into the pathogenesis of 
      HD and related disorders.

TI  - Possible association of temporomandibular joint pain and dysfunction with a 
      polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene.
PG  - 308-13
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between 
      temporomandibular joint pain and dysfunction and serotonin transporter (5-HTT) 
      gene polymorphism. Forty-eight patients with temporomandibular joint pain and 111 
      healthy control subjects were examined. The results for the patients and control 
      subjects were not significantly different (P >.05). The analysis of genotype 
      distribution (homozygous for STin 2.10 genotypes of the variable-number 
      tandem-repeat polymorphism) showed significant differences between the patients 
      and control subjects (P =.003). ST 2.10 allele was more frequent in the patients 
      with temporomandibular joint pain and dysfunction. In the control group, however, 
      STin 2.12/12 genotype was significantly higher (P =.017). In the patients who 
      were homozygous or heterozygous for variable-number tandem-repeat variants of 
      5-HTT STin 2.12 copies, the average scores of somatization and anger were 
      significantly higher than those who were homozygous for STin 2.10 variant (P 
      <.05). The patients who were homozygous for STin 2.10 genotype were also 
      homozygous for "L" genotype (P =.019). However, this was not the condition in the 
      control subjects. This study does not provide evidence to support the involvement 
      of 5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region in temporomandibular joint pain and 
      dysfunction. Our findings indicated that only the presence of the homozygous STin 
      2.10 genotype of variable-number tandem-repeat is likely to play a substantial 
      role in the genetic predisposition to temporomandibular joint pain and 
      dysfunction and that the STin 2.12/12 genotype may have a protective role against 
      temporomandibular joint pain and dysfunction.

TI  - Polyglutamine expansions cause decreased CRE-mediated transcription and early 
      gene expression changes prior to cell death in an inducible cell model of 
      Huntington's disease.
PG  - 1829-45
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is one of 10 known diseases caused by a (CAG)(n) 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion that is translated into an abnormally long 
      polyglutamine tract. We have developed stable inducible neuronal (PC12) cell 
      lines that express huntingtin exon 1 with varying CAG repeat lengths under 
      doxycycline (dox) control. The expression of expanded repeats is associated with 
      aggregate formation, caspase-dependent cell death and decreased neurite 
      outgrowth. Post-mitotic cells expressing mutant alleles were more prone to cell 
      death compared with identical cycling cells. To determine early metabolic changes 
      induced by this mutation in cell models, we studied changes in gene expression 
      after 18 h dox induction, using Affymetrix arrays, cDNA filters and 
      adapter-tagged competitive PCR (ATAC-PCR). At this time point there were low 
      rates of inclusion formation, no evidence of mitochondrial compromise and no 
      excess cell death in the lines expressing expanded compared with wild-type 
      repeats. The expression profiles suggest novel targets for the HD mutation and 
      were compatible with impaired cAMP response element (CRE)-mediated transcription, 
      which we confirmed using CRE-luciferase reporter assays. Reduced CRE-mediated 
      transcription may contribute to the loss of neurite outgrowth and cell death in 
      polyglutamine diseases, as these phenotypes were partially rescued by treating 
      cells with cAMP or forskolin.

TI  - Juvenile Huntington's disease presenting as progressive myoclonic epilepsy.
PG  - 708-11
AB  - A 9-year-old girl, who had no family history of neurologic diseases in the 
      first-degree relatives, had a 3-year history of progressive myoclonus epilepsy 
      (PME). A thorough laboratory investigation was normal. As two sisters of her 
      paternal grandmother were said to have Huntington's disease (HD), the authors 
      looked for HD and found a CAG repeat expansion of 115 repeats. This diagnosis 
      should be considered in addition to other causes in patients with PME. Moreover, 
      the current case further supports the notion that HD should be considered even 
      when a family history is not obvious.

TI  - Age-dependent and tissue-specific CAG repeat instability occurs in mouse knock-in 
      for a mutant Huntington's disease gene.
PG  - 289-97
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the 
      expansion of CAG repeats in exon 1 of the HD gene. To clarify the instability of 
      expanded CAG repeats in HD patients, an HD model mouse has been generated by gene 
      replacement with human exon 1 of the HD gene with expansion to 77 CAG repeats. 
      Chimeric proteins composed of human mutated exon 1 and mouse huntingtin are 
      expressed ubiquitously in brain and peripheral tissues. One or two CAG repeat 
      expansion was found in litters from paternal transmission, whereas contraction of 
      CAG repeat in litters was observed through maternal transmission. Elderly mice 
      show greater CAG repeat instability than younger mice, and a unique case was 
      observed of an expanded 97 CAG repeat mouse. Somatic CAG repeat instability is 
      particularly pronounced in the liver, kidney, stomach, and brain but not in the 
      cerebellum of 100-week-old mice. The same results of expanded CAG repeat 
      instability as observed in this HD model mouse were confirmed in the human brain 
      of HD patients. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells have been 
      found to be increased in the substantia nigra (SN), globus pallidus (GP), and 
      striatum (St) in the brains of 40-week-old affected mice, although without 
      neuronal cell death. The CAG repeat instability and increase in GFAP-positive 
      cells in this mouse model appear to mirror the abnormalities in HD patients. The 
      HD model mouse may therefore have advantages for investigations of molecular 
      mechanisms underlying instability of CAG repeats.

TI  - Instability of a (CGG)98 repeat in the Fmr1 promoter.
PG  - 1693-9
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is one of 14 trinucleotide repeat diseases. It arises due to 
      expansion of a CGG repeat which is present in the 5'-untranslated region of the 
      FMR1 gene, disruption of which leads to mental retardation. The mechanisms 
      involved in trinucleotide repeat expansion are poorly understood and to date, 
      transgenic mouse models containing transgenic expanded CGG repeats have failed to 
      reproduce the instability seen in humans. As both cis-acting factors and the 
      genomic context of the CGG repeat are thought to play a role in expansion, we 
      have now generated a knock-in mouse Fmr1 gene in which the murine (CGG)8 repeat 
      has been exchanged with a human (CGG)98 repeat. Unlike other CGG transgenic 
      models, this model shows moderate CGG repeat instability upon both in maternal 
      and paternal transmission. This model will now enable us to study the timing and 
      the mechanism of repeat expansion in mice.

TI  - Functional characterization of the human Huntington's disease gene promoter.
PG  - 85-97
AB  - The genetic basis of neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (HD) has been 
      identified as a (CAG)(>37) repeat expansion in a gene of unknown function. 
      Interestingly, patients with the same expanded (CAG)(n) repeat length may have 
      markedly different ages at onset. Based on experiences in animal models the level 
      of expression might be one of the modifying factors. To gain insight into the 
      regulation of the human HD gene we functionally analyzed 2266 bp of the HD gene 
      promoter region. This region lacks a TATA and a CAAT box, is GCrich, and it has 
      several consensus sequences for SP1, AP-2 and AP-4 binding sites. The stretch 
      between nucleotides -49 and -198 relative to the first ATG is highly conserved 
      between human and rodents and it harbors several potential binding sites for 
      transcription factors. We analyzed deletion mutants fused with the 
      chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene in transfected, huntingtin 
      expressing neuronal (NS20Y) and non-neuronal (CHO) cell lines. Partial deletion 
      of the evolutionarily conserved part of the promoter significantly reduces the 
      activity in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells indicating that the core 
      promoter activity is located between nucleotides -221 and 4, relative to the +1 
      translation start site. Binding affinities of DNA-protein interactions were 
      defined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and the protected nucleotide 
      positions were determined by DNase I footprinting.

TI  - Somatic mosaicism in Wiskott--Aldrich syndrome suggests in vivo reversion by a 
      DNA slippage mechanism.
PG  - 8697-702
AB  - Somatic mosaicism caused by in vivo reversion of inherited mutations has been 
      described in several human genetic disorders. Back mutations resulting in 
      restoration of wild-type sequences and second-site mutations leading to 
      compensatory changes have been shown in mosaic individuals. In most cases, 
      however, the precise genetic mechanisms underlying the reversion events have 
      remained unclear, except for the few instances where crossing over or gene 
      conversion have been demonstrated. Here, we report a patient affected with 
      Wiskott--Aldrich syndrome (WAS) caused by a 6-bp insertion (ACGAGG) in the WAS 
      protein gene, which abrogates protein expression. Somatic mosaicism was 
      documented in this patient whose majority of T lymphocytes expressed nearly 
      normal levels of WAS protein. These lymphocytes were found to lack the 
      deleterious mutation and showed a selective growth advantage in vivo. Analysis of 
      the sequence surrounding the mutation site showed that the 6-bp insertion 
      followed a tandem repeat of the same six nucleotides. These findings strongly 
      suggest that DNA polymerase slippage was the cause of the original germ-line 
      insertion mutation in this family and that the same mechanism was responsible for 
      its deletion in one of the propositus T cell progenitors, thus leading to 
      reversion mosaicism.

TI  - The role of serotonin transporter protein gene in antidepressant-induced mania in 
      bipolar disorder: preliminary findings.
PG  - 539-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: The occurrence of mania during antidepressant treatment is a key 
      issue in the clinical management of bipolar disorder (BP). The serotonin 
      transporter (5-HTT) is the selective site of action of most proserotonergic 
      compounds used to treat bipolar depression. The 5-HTT gene (SLC6A4) has 2 known 
      polymorphisms. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the SLC6A4 
      variants in the pathogenesis of antidepressant-induced mania in BP. METHODS: 
      Twenty-seven patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of BP I or II, with at least 1 
      manic or hypomanic episode induced by treatment with proserotonergic 
      antidepressants (IM+ group), were compared with 29 unrelated, matched patients 
      with a diagnosis of BP I or II, who had been exposed to proserotonergic 
      antidepressants without development of manic or hypomanic symptoms (IM- group). 
      The 2 known polymorphisms of the SLC6A4 were genotyped, and allelic and genotypic 
      association analyses were performed. RESULTS: With respect to the polymorphism in 
      the promoter region (5HTTLPR), IM+ patients had an excess of the short allele (n 
      = 34 [63%]) compared with IM- patients (n = 17 [29%]) (chi(2)(1), 12.77; P 
      <.001). The genotypic association analysis showed a higher rate of homozygosity 
      for the short variant in the IM+ group (n = 10 [37%]) than in the IM- group (n = 
      2 [7%]) and a lower rate of homozygosity for the long variant in the IM+ group (n 
      = 3 [11%]) compared with the IM- group (n = 14 [48%]) (chi(2)(2), 12.43; P 
      =.002). No associations were found for the polymorphism involving a variable 
      number of tandem repeats. CONCLUSION: If these results are replicated, the 
      5HTTLPR polymorphism may become an important predictor of abnormal response to 
      medication in patients with BP.

TI  - UVB irradiation-induced apoptosis increased in lymphocytes of Huntington's 
      disease patients.
PG  - 1653-6
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by CAG repeat expansion in the IT-15 gene coding for huntingtin. The 
      mechanism of neuronal degeneration induced by the mutant huntingtin is not known. 
      Apoptosis may play a role in it. Huntingtin is widely expressed in the cells, so 
      abnormalities can be expected also in non-neural tissue. We examined the 
      susceptibility of lymphocytes from HD patients, asymptomatic carriers and normal 
      individuals to UVB irradiation-induced apoptosis. Lymphocytes from eight HD 
      patients and two asymptomatic carriers showed increased apoptotic cell death 
      compared to controls. Our results suggests that sensitivity of HD cells to 
      induced apoptosis is not restricted to neurons.

TI  - Expanded CAG repeats in exon 1 of the Huntington's disease gene stimulate 
      dopamine-mediated striatal neuron autophagy and degeneration.
PG  - 1243-54
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expanded CAG repeat in exon 1 of the 
      gene coding for the huntingtin protein. The cellular pathway by which this 
      mutation induces HD remains unknown, although alterations in protein degradation 
      are involved. To study intrinsic cellular mechanisms linked to the mutation, we 
      examined dissociated postnatally derived cultures of striatal neurons from 
      transgenic mice expressing exon 1 of the human HD gene carrying a CAG repeat 
      expansion. While there was no difference in cell death between wild-type and 
      mutant littermate-derived cultures, the mutant striatal neurons exhibited 
      elevated cell death following a single exposure to a neurotoxic concentration of 
      dopamine. The mutant neurons exposed to dopamine also exhibited 
      lysosome-associated responses including induction of autophagic granules and 
      electron-dense lysosomes. The autophagic/lysosomal compartments co-localized with 
      high levels of oxygen radicals in living neurons, and ubiquitin. The results 
      suggest that the combination of mutant huntingtin and a source of oxyradical 
      stress (provided in this case by dopamine) induces autophagy and may underlie the 
      selective cell death characteristic of HD.

TI  - Serotonin transporter polymorphisms: no association with response to 
      antipsychotic treatment, but associations with the schizoparanoid and residual 
      subtypes of schizophrenia.
PG  - 179-85
AB  - The human serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT) demonstrates two polymorphisms with 
      possible functional impact: a 44-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism of the 
      promoter region and a 17-bp variable number of tandem repeat polymorphism (VNTR) 
      in intron 2 (STin2). Such genetic polymorphisms in the serotoninergic system may 
      increase the susceptibility to schizophrenia or may serve as predictors of 
      therapeutic response. We therefore analyzed these polymorphisms as susceptibility 
      factors for schizophrenia by comparison of 684 schizophrenic inpatients with 587 
      healthy controls. We furthermore compared the therapeutic outcome of 
      schizophrenic patients differentiated by the 5-HTT genotypes. Schizo-affective 
      patients were more frequently homozygous for the 44-bp insertion allele (Odds 
      ratio, OR: 1.6, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.1--2.3, P < 0.03) than were all 
      other schizophrenic patients and controls. The 17-bp VNTR alleles found were: 
      STin2.7, 9, 10, and 12. Sequence analysis revealed seven different sequence 
      motifs with an invariable arrangement. Patients with schizo-paranoid 
      schizophrenia were more frequently homozygous for the STin2.12 allele than were 
      controls (OR: 1.4, CI: 1.1--1.8, P < 0.007) and all other schizophrenic patients 
      (OR: 1.6, CI: 1.2--2.3). The STin2.9 allele represented a risk factor for the 
      residual subtype of schizophrenia (OR: 6.4, CI: 2.5--16.2, P < 0.001). On the 
      basis of global clinical impressions, as well as measurements with the positive 
      and negative syndrome scale we found no association of the polymorphisms with 
      therapeutic response. In conclusion, the 44-bp polymorphism may be associated 
      with the schizo-affective and the 17-bp VNTR with the residual and 
      schizo-paranoid subtype of schizophrenia, findings which require further 
      biochemical and epidemiological confirmation.

TI  - The "flap" endonuclease gene FEN1 is excluded as a candidate gene implicated in 
      the CAG repeat expansion underlying Huntington disease.
PG  - 122-7
AB  - At least 12 disorders including Huntington disease (HD) are associated with 
      expansion of a trinucleotide repeat (TNR). Factors contributing to the risk of 
      expansion of TNRs and the mechanism of expansion have not been elucidated. Data 
      from Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggest that the flap endonuclease FEN1 plays a 
      role in expansion of repetitive DNA tracts. It has been hypothesized that 
      insufficiency of FEN1 or a mutant FEN1 might contribute to the occurrence of 
      expansion events of long repetitive DNA tracts after polymerase slippage events 
      during lagging strand synthesis. The expression pattern of FEN1 was determined, 
      and ubiquitous tissue expression, including germ cells, suggested that FEN1 has 
      the potential to be involved in HD. Fifteen HD parent/child pairs that 
      demonstrated intergenerational increases in CAG length of greater than 10 repeats 
      were examined for possible mutations or polymorphisms within the FEN1 gene that 
      could underlie the saltatory repeat expansions seen in these individuals. No 
      alterations were observed compared to 50 controls, excluding FEN1 as a 
      trans-acting factor underlying TNR expansion. The identification of a candidate 
      gene(s) in HD or other CAG-expansion disorders implicated in TNR instability will 
      elucidate the mechanism of expansion for this growing family of neurological 
      disorders.

TI  - Huntington's disease: from gene to potential therapy.
PG  - 17-23
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive, late-onset neurodegenerative illness 
      with autosomal dominant inheritance that affects one in 10 000 individuals in 
      Western Europe. The disease is caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion located 
      in the N-terminal region of the huntingtin protein. The mutation is likely to act 
      by a gain of function, but the molecular mechanisms by which it leads to neuronal 
      dysfunction and cell death are not yet known. The normal function of huntingtin 
      in cell metabolism is also unclear. There is no therapy for HD. Research on HD 
      should help elucidate the pathogenetic mechanism of this illness in order to 
      develop successful treatments to prevent or slow down symptoms. This article 
      presents new results in HD research focusing on in vivo and in vitro model 
      systems, potential molecular mechanisms of HD, and the development of therapeutic 
      strategies.

TI  - Transplanted fetal striatum in Huntington's disease: phenotypic development and 
      lack of pathology.
PG  - 13877-82
AB  - Neural and stem cell transplantation is emerging as a potential treatment for 
      neurodegenerative diseases. Transplantation of specific committed neuroblasts 
      (fetal neurons) to the adult brain provides such scientific exploration of these 
      new potential therapies. Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal, incurable 
      autosomal dominant (CAG repeat expansion of huntingtin protein) neurodegenerative 
      disorder with primary neuronal pathology within the caudate-putamen (striatum). 
      In a clinical trial of human fetal striatal tissue transplantation, one patient 
      died 18 months after transplantation from cardiovascular disease, and postmortem 
      histological analysis demonstrated surviving transplanted cells with typical 
      morphology of the developing striatum. Selective markers of both striatal 
      projection and interneurons such as dopamine and c-AMP-related phosphoprotein, 
      calretinin, acetylcholinesterase, choline acetyltransferase, tyrosine 
      hydroxylase, calbindin, enkephalin, and substance P showed positive transplant 
      regions clearly innervated by host tyrosine hydroxylase fibers. There was no 
      histological evidence of immune rejection including microglia and macrophages. 
      Notably, neuronal protein aggregates of mutated huntingtin, which is typical HD 
      neuropathology, were not found within the transplanted fetal tissue. Thus, 
      although there is a genetically predetermined process causing neuronal death 
      within the HD striatum, implanted fetal neural cells lacking the mutant HD gene 
      may be able to replace damaged host neurons and reconstitute damaged neuronal 
      connections. This study demonstrates that grafts derived from human fetal 
      striatal tissue can survive, develop, and are unaffected by the disease process, 
      at least for 18 months, after transplantation into a patient with HD.

TI  - Gender of the embryo contributes to CAG instability in transgenic mice containing 
      a Huntington's disease gene.
PG  - 2767-75
AB  - Gender is known to influence the transmission of trinucleotide repeats in human 
      disease. However, the molecular basis for the parent-of-origin effect associated 
      with trinucleotide repeat expansion is not known. We have followed, during 
      transmission, the fate of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in a transgene containing 
      the exon 1 portion of the human Huntington's disease (HD) gene. Similar to 
      humans, the mouse transmits expansions predominantly through the male germ line. 
      Surprisingly, we find that the CAG repeat size of the mutant human HD gene is 
      different in male and female progeny from identical fathers. Males predominantly 
      expand the repeat whereas females predominantly contract the repeat. In contrast 
      to the classic definition of imprinting, CAG expansion is influenced by the 
      gender of the embryo. Our results raise the possibility that there are X- or 
      Y-encoded factors that influence repair or replication of DNA in the embryo. 
      Gender dependence in the embryo may explain why expansion in HD from premutation 
      to disease primarily occurs through the paternal line.

TI  - DMSO and glycerol reduce bacterial death induced by expression of truncated 
      N-terminal huntingtin with expanded polyglutamine tracts.
PG  - 247-56
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of a large 
      gene, IT15, possessing 67 exons. Transgenic mice expressing a truncated 
      N-terminal peptide of huntingtin with an expanded polyglutamine tract translated 
      only from exon 1 develop symptoms similar to Huntington's disease. In the present 
      study, a bacterial system (Escherichia coli) was used to express truncated 
      peptides of huntingtin translated from exon 1 of the HD gene. Bacterial death was 
      observed after the induction of peptides with expanded polyglutamine tracts, and 
      both sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-soluble peptides and insoluble aggregated 
      material were detected by immunoblotting in the homogenates of such E. coli. E. 
      coli death was partially reduced by the addition of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or 
      glycerol to the medium, with a consequent decrease in aggregated material and an 
      increase in SDS-soluble peptide in the homogenate. These results suggest that 
      DMSO and glycerol may decrease the toxicity of huntingtin with expanded 
      polyglutamine tracts by acting as chemical chaperones.

TI  - Dramatic mutation instability in HD mouse striatum: does polyglutamine load 
      contribute to cell-specific vulnerability in Huntington's disease?
PG  - 2539-44
AB  - An unstable CAG triplet repeat expansion encoding a polyglutamine stretch within 
      the ubiquitously expressed protein huntingtin is responsible for causing 
      Huntington's disease (HD). By quantifying the repeat sizes of individual mutant 
      alleles in tissues derived from an accurate genetic mouse model of HD we show 
      that the mutation becomes very unstable in striatal tissue. The expansion-biased 
      changes increase with age, such that some striatal cells from old HD mice contain 
      mutations that have tripled in size. If this pattern of repeat instability is 
      recapitulated in human striatal tissue, the concomitant increased polyglutamine 
      load may contribute to the patterns of selective neuronal cell death in HD. Our 
      findings also suggest that trinucleotide repeat instability can occur by 
      mechanisms that are not replication-based.

TI  - Large expansion of the ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 10.
PG  - 191-4
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10; MIM 603516; refs 1,2) is an autosomal 
      dominant disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia and seizures. The gene SCA10 
      maps to a 3.8-cM interval on human chromosome 22q13-qter (refs 1,2). Because 
      several other SCA subtypes show trinucleotide repeat expansions, we examined 
      microsatellites in this region. We found an expansion of a pentanucleotide 
      (ATTCT) repeat in intron 9 of SCA10 in all patients in five Mexican SCA10 
      families. There was an inverse correlation between the expansion size, up to 22.5 
      kb larger than the normal allele, and the age of onset (r2=0.34, P=0.018). 
      Analysis of 562 chromosomes from unaffected individuals of various ethnic origins 
      (including 242 chromosomes from Mexican persons) showed a range of 10 to 22 ATTCT 
      repeats with no evidence of expansions. Our data indicate that the new SCA10 
      intronic ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat in SCA10 patients is unstable and 
      represents the largest microsatellite expansion found so far in the human genome.

AB  - Mice transgenic for the first exon of the human Huntington's disease (HD) gene 
      carrying an expanded CAG repeat expansion (R6/2 line) develop a progressive 
      neurologic phenotype with symptoms resembling those seen in HD. The overt 
      symptoms of R6/2 mice worsen with age, resulting in a rapid decline in health and 
      premature death between 13 and 18 weeks of age. In this study, we characterized 
      the onset and progression of the overt phenotype in R6/2 mice and examined 
      factors that affect the phenotype and life expectancy of these mice. In 
      particular, the effects of altering home cage environment, through changing 
      feeding regimes and providing environmental stimulation, were investigated. We 
      show that changes in feeding regimes significantly improved the general 
      well-being and life expectancy of R6/2 mice. Furthermore, we find that various 
      forms of environmental stimulation, including regular behavioral testing, 
      significantly improved the survival of R6/2 mice over and above that resulting 
      from the enhanced feeding regime. The fact that environmental stimulation 
      improves the health and life expectancy in R6/2 mice not only enables the mice to 
      serve as more useful research tools, but also suggests that environmental 
      stimulation may have a beneficial impact on the progression of HD in patients.

TI  - Fragile X males with unmethylated, full mutation trinucleotide repeat expansions 
      have elevated levels of FMR1 messenger RNA.
PG  - 232-6
AB  - Fragile X syndrome normally arises as a consequence of large expansions (n >200) 
      of a (CGG)(n) trinucleotide repeat in the promoter region of the FMR1 gene. The 
      clinical phenotype is thought to result from hypermethylation of the repeat and 
      adjacent upstream elements, with consequent down-regulation of transcription 
      (transcriptional silencing). However, the relationship between repeat expansion 
      and transcription has not been defined in the full mutation range. Using the 
      method of quantitative (fluorescence) reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 
      reaction, we demonstrated previously that FMR1 mRNA levels are substantially 
      elevated in premutation (55 </= n < 200) male carriers. In the current work, we 
      report that in fragile X males with unmethylated alleles in the full mutation 
      range (n > 200), FMR1 mRNA levels remain significantly elevated (mean 3.5-fold 
      elevation; P = 6.7 x 10(-3)) relative to normal controls, even for alleles 
      exceeding 300 repeats. This conclusion is independent of any assumption regarding 
      the transcriptional activity of methylated alleles. However, if it were assumed 
      that all methylated alleles were transcriptionally silent, the FMR1 mRNA levels 
      for cells with unmethylated alleles would be even higher (mean 4.5-fold 
      elevation; P = 2.1 x 10(-4)). These observations show that the full-mutation CGG 
      expansion per se is not a strong impediment to transcription and that the 
      apparent up-regulation of the FMR1 locus remains active in at least some cells 
      with full-mutation alleles.

TI  - Participation of par-4 in the degeneration of striatal neurons induced by 
      metabolic compromise with 3-nitropropionic acid.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by chorea, psychiatric disturbances, and dementia. It is caused by 
      a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the huntingtin protein. The striatum is a 
      major site of neuronal loss in HD, but the mechanisms underlying the 
      neurodegenerative process have not been established. Systemic administration of 
      the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP) to rodents 
      results in motor dysfunction and degeneration of striatal neurons with features 
      similar to those of HD. Here we report that levels of prostate apoptosis 
      response-4 (Par-4; a protein recently linked to neuronal apoptosis) increase in 
      striatum, and to a lesser extent in cortex and hippocampus, after systemic 
      administration of 3NP to adult rats. The increase in Par-4 levels occurred within 
      6 h of 3NP administration and was followed by an increase in caspase activation 
      which preceded neuronal loss. Exposure of cultured primary striatal neurons to 
      3NP induced a rapid increase of Par-4 levels and caspase activation. Treatment of 
      striatal neurons with a Par-4 antisense oligonucleotide blocked Par-4 induction 
      by 3NP, suppressed caspase activation, and attenuated neuronal apoptosis. The 
      caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD suppressed 3NP-induced apoptosis of striatal neurons, 
      but did not prevent induction of Par-4, indicating that Par-4 acts upstream of 
      caspase-3 activation in the cell death pathway. Our results suggest that Par-4 
      plays an important role in the degeneration of striatal neurons in an 
      experimental model of HD.

TI  - Fragile X CGG repeat structures among African-Americans: identification of a 
      novel factor responsible for repeat instability.
PG  - 1759-69
AB  - The cryptic CGG repeat responsible for the fragile X syndrome, located in the 
      5'-UTR of FMR1, is unique compared with the many other triplet repeat-causing 
      diseases, making it ideal for identifying factors involved in repeat expansion 
      that may be common to other triplet repeat diseases. To date, a number of factors 
      have been identified which may influence repeat instability, including the number 
      and position of interspersed AGGs, length of the 3' pure CGG repeat and haplotype 
      background. However, nearly all such data were derived from studies of 
      Caucasians. Using a large African-American population, we present the only 
      comprehensive examination of factors associated with CGG repeat instability in a 
      non-Caucasian population. Among Caucasians, susceptible alleles were thought to 
      come from those in the intermediate repeat range (41-60 repeats); however, we 
      find that susceptible alleles may come from a larger repeat pool (35-60 repeats) 
      and are better defined by their pure CGG repeat and/or -presence of only one AGG 
      interruption. These results demonstrate the existence of different susceptible 
      alleles among world populations and may account for the similar prevalence of the 
      fragile X syndrome in African-Americans compared with Caucasians despite the 
      lower frequency of inter-mediate sized alleles in the African-American 
      population. Finally, we show that repeat structures among unaffected 
      African-Americans with the most frequent fragile X haplotype background are 
      either pure or contain a single distal interruption. We propose that the lack of 
      a proximal most interruption is a novel factor involved in CGG repeat 
      instability.

TI  - Decreased expression of striatal signaling genes in a mouse model of Huntington's 
      disease.
PG  - 1259-71
AB  - To understand gene expression changes mediated by a polyglutamine repeat 
      expansion in the human huntingtin protein, we used oligonucleotide DNA arrays to 
      profile approximately 6000 striatal mRNAs in the R6/2 mouse, a transgenic 
      Huntington's disease (HD) model. We found diminished levels of mRNAs encoding 
      components of the neurotransmitter, calcium and retinoid signaling pathways at 
      both early and late symptomatic time points (6 and 12 weeks of age). We observed 
      similar changes in gene expression in another HD mouse model (N171-82Q). These 
      results demonstrate that mutant huntingtin directly or indirectly reduces the 
      expression of a distinct set of genes involved in signaling pathways known to be 
      critical to striatal neuron function.

TI  - Mice deficient in Six5 develop cataracts: implications for myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 105-9
AB  - Expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3' UTR of the gene DMPK at the DM1 
      locus on chromosome 19 causes myotonic dystrophy, a dominantly inherited disease 
      characterized by skeletal muscle dystrophy and myotonia, cataracts and cardiac 
      conduction defects. Targeted deletion of Dm15, the mouse orthologue of human 
      DMPK, produced mice with a mild myopathy and cardiac conduction abnormalities, 
      but without other features of myotonic dystrophy, such as myotonia and cataracts. 
      We, and others, have demonstrated that repeat expansion decreases expression of 
      the adjacent gene SIX5 (refs 7,8), which encodes a homeodomain transcription 
      factor. To determine whether SIX5 deficiency contributes to the myotonic 
      dystrophy phenotype, we disrupted mouse Six5 by replacing the first exon with a 
      beta-galactosidase reporter. Six5-mutant mice showed reporter expression in 
      multiple tissues, including the developing lens. Homozygous mutant mice had no 
      apparent abnormalities of skeletal muscle function, but developed lenticular 
      opacities at a higher rate than controls. Our results suggest that SIX5 
      deficiency contributes to the cataract phenotype in myotonic dystrophy, and that 
      myotonic dystrophy represents a multigenic disorder.

TI  - Tentative association of the serotonin transporter with schizophrenia and 
      unipolar depression but not with bipolar disorder in Han Chinese.
PG  - 491-5
AB  - The serotonin transporter gene (SERT) plays an important role in the serotonin 
      uptake into neurons. Recently, several polymorphisms including a 
      variable-number-tandem-repeat (VNTR) in the second intron and an 
      insertion/deletion polymorphism (5-HTT linked polymorphic region, 5-HTTLPR) were 
      identified and reported to be associated with a variety of mental illnesses, 
      including major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety-related traits, and autism. 
      In our study, we performed an association study between the SERT VNTR 
      polymorphism and schizophrenia (n = 260), bipolar disorder (n = 137), and 
      unipolar depression (n = 33) in the Han Chinese. A large group of ethnically 
      matched control individuals (n = 362) were also genotyped. Allele 12 of the VNTR 
      polymorphism was associated with schizophrenia (P = 0.007) and unipolar 
      depression (P = 0.011). Bipolar disorder was not associated with the VNTR (P = 
      0.93). Thus, we conclude that the SERT VNTR polymorphism may be a risk factor for 
      both schizophrenia and unipolar depression, but not for bipolar disorder, in the 
      Han Chinese.

TI  - Gaucher disease: the origins of the Ashkenazi Jewish N370S and 84GG acid 
      beta-glucosidase mutations.
PG  - 1821-32
AB  - Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD), a non-neuronopathic lysosomal storage disorder, 
      results from the deficient activity of acid beta-glucosidase (GBA). Type 1 
      disease is panethnic but is more prevalent in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish 
      (AJ) descent. Of the causative GBA mutations, N370S is particularly frequent in 
      the AJ population, (q approximately .03), whereas the 84GG insertion (q 
      approximately .003) occurs exclusively in the Ashkenazim. To investigate the 
      genetic history of these mutations in the AJ population, short tandem repeat 
      (STR) markers were used to map a 9.3-cM region containing the GBA locus and to 
      genotype 261 AJ N370S chromosomes, 60 European non-Jewish N370S chromosomes, and 
      62 AJ 84GG chromosomes. A highly conserved haplotype at four markers flanking GBA 
      (PKLR, D1S1595, D1S2721, and D1S2777) was observed on both the AJ chromosomes and 
      the non-Jewish N370S chromosomes, suggesting the occurrence of a founder common 
      to both populations. Of note, the presence of different divergent haplotypes 
      suggested the occurrence of de novo, recurrent N370S mutations. In contrast, a 
      different conserved haplotype at these markers was identified on the 84GG 
      chromosomes, which was unique to the AJ population. On the basis of the linkage 
      disequilibrium (LD) delta values, the non-Jewish European N370S chromosomes had 
      greater haplotype diversity and less LD at the markers flanking the conserved 
      haplotype than did the AJ N370S chromosomes. This finding is consistent with the 
      presence of the N370S mutation in the non-Jewish European population prior to the 
      founding of the AJ population. Coalescence analyses for the N370S and 84GG 
      mutations estimated similar coalescence times, of 48 and 55.5 generations ago, 
      respectively. The results of these studies are consistent with a significant 
      bottleneck occurring in the AJ population during the first millennium, when the 
      population became established in Europe.

TI  - Molecular diagnosis of Huntington disease in Brazilian patients.
PG  - 11-7
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with 
      autosomal dominant inheritance, characterized by choreiform movements and 
      cognitive impairment. Onset of symptoms is around 40 years of age and progression 
      to death occurs in approximately 10 to 15 years from the time of disease onset. 
      HD is associated with an unstable CAG repeat expansion at the 5' and of the IT15 
      gene. We have genotyped the CAG repeat in the IT15 gene in 44 Brazilian 
      individuals (42 patients and 2 unaffected family members) belonging to 34 
      unrelated families thought to segregate HD. We found one expanded CAG allele in 
      32 individuals (76%) belonging to 25 unrelated families. In these HD patients, 
      expanded alleles varied from 43 to 73 CAG units and normal alleles varied from 18 
      to 26 CAGs. A significant negative correlation between age at onset of symptoms 
      and size of the expanded CAG allele was found (r=0.6; p=0.0001); however, the 
      size of the expanded CAG repeat could explain only about 40% of the variability 
      in age at onset (r2=0.4). In addition, we genotyped 25 unrelated control 
      individuals (total of 50 alleles) and found normal CAG repeats varying from 16 to 
      33 units. The percentage of heterozigocity of the normal allele in the control 
      population was 88%. In conclusion, our results showed that not all patients with 
      the "HD" phenotype carried the expansion at the IT15 gene. Furthermore, molecular 
      diagnosis was possible in all individuals, since no alleles of intermediate size 
      were found. Therefore, molecular confirmation of the clinical diagnosis in HD 
      should be sought in all suspected patients, making it possible for adequate 
      genetic counseling.

TI  - Absence of unidentified CAG repeat expansion in patients with Huntington's 
      disease-like phenotype.
PG  - 672-5
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by an expanded (CAG)n repeat on the huntingtin gene. It is characterised 
      by motor, psychiatric and cognitive disturbances. Diagnosis can be confirmed by 
      direct genetic testing, which is highly sensitive and specific and is now 
      considered definitive. This study focused on 21 patients presenting with a 
      clinical phenotype showing strong similarity to HD, but who do not have an 
      expanded CAG in the huntingtin gene. However, other possible diagnoses could be 
      evoked for most of them. Seven patients (3.5% of our cohort) could be considered 
      as phenocopies of HD with no alternative diagnosis. Samples were screened for 
      other triplet repeat diseases with similar presentation (DRPLA, SCA-1, SCA-2, 
      SCA-3, SCA-6, and SCA-7) and were all negative. The repeat expansion detection 
      technique (RED) was used to detect uncloned CAG repeat expansions and samples 
      were also analysed by polymerase chain reaction for expansions of the polymorphic 
      CAG-ERDA-1 and CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeats. RED expansion (>40 repeats) was 
      detected in only one patient. The results suggest that unstable CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions corresponding to known or unknown sequences are not involved in the 
      aetiology of HD-like disorders. It is hypothesised that some of these phenocopies 
      could correspond to mutations in other unidentified genes with other unstable 
      repeats (different from CAG) or in unknown genes with other mutations.

TI  - Survey of the fragile X syndrome CGG repeat and the short-tandem-repeat and 
      single-nucleotide-polymorphism haplotypes in an African American population.
PG  - 480-93
AB  - Previous studies have shown that specific short-tandem-repeat (STR) and 
      single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP)-based haplotypes within and among unaffected 
      and fragile X white populations are found to be associated with specific 
      CGG-repeat patterns. It has been hypothesized that these associations result from 
      different mutational mechanisms, possibly influenced by the CGG structure and/or 
      cis-acting factors. Alternatively, haplotype associations may result from the 
      long mutational history of increasing instability. To understand the basis of the 
      mutational process, we examined the CGG-repeat size, three flanking STR markers 
      (DXS548-FRAXAC1-FRAXAC2), and one SNP (ATL1) spanning 150 kb around the CGG 
      repeat in unaffected (n=637) and fragile X (n=63) African American populations 
      and compared them with unaffected (n=721) and fragile X (n=102) white 
      populations. Several important differences were found between the two ethnic 
      groups. First, in contrast to that seen in the white population, no associations 
      were observed among the African American intermediate or "predisposed" alleles 
      (41-60 repeats). Second, two previously undescribed haplotypes accounted for the 
      majority of the African American fragile X population. Third, a putative 
      "protective" haplotype was not found among African Americans, whereas it was 
      found among whites. Fourth, in contrast to that seen in whites, the SNP ATL1 was 
      in linkage equilibrium among African Americans, and it did not add new 
      information to the STR haplotypes. These data indicate that the STR- and 
      SNP-based haplotype associations identified in whites probably reflect the 
      mutational history of the expansion, rather than a mutational mechanism or 
      pathway.

TI  - A recurrent expansion of a maternal allele with 36 CAG repeats causes Huntington 
      disease in two sisters.
PG  - 1145-8
AB  - Large intergenerational repeat expansions of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the 
      HD gene have been well documented for the male germline. We describe a recurrent 
      large expansion of a maternal allele with 36 CAG repeats (to 66 and 57 repeats, 
      respectively, in two daughters) associated with onset of Huntington disease (HD) 
      in the second and third decade in a family without history of HD. Our findings 
      give evidence of a gonadal mosaicism in the unaffected mother. We hypothesize 
      that large expansions also occur in the female germline and that a negative 
      selection of oocytes with long repeats might explain the different instability 
      behavior of the male and the female germlines.

TI  - Correlation between triplet repeat expansion and computed tomography measures of 
      caudate nuclei atrophy in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 1090-3
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, progressive disorder 
      characterized by choreic movements, cognitive decline, and psychiatric 
      manifestations. Eleven patients with HD were retrospectively selected from a 
      larger group of 42 patients based on the similar, early onset of the disease 
      (between 21 and 30 years) and the same duration of HD at the moment of computed 
      tomography (CT) examination (5 years). A significant correlation between the 
      number of CAG trinucleotides and the bicaudate index or the frontal horn index, 
      two indices of caudate atrophy, was found in this group of patients. Our results, 
      although in a small number of patients, suggest that the striatal degeneration, 
      assessed by CT measures, is primarily regulated by the size of expanded CAG 
      repeats.

TI  - Elevated levels of FMR1 mRNA in carrier males: a new mechanism of involvement in 
      the fragile-X syndrome.
PG  - 6-15
AB  - Fragile-X syndrome is a trinucleotide-repeat-expansion disorder in which the 
      clinical phenotype is believed to result from transcriptional silencing of the 
      fragile-X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene as the number of CGG repeats exceeds 
      approximately 200. For premutation alleles ( approximately 55-200 repeats), no 
      abnormalities in FMR1-gene expression have been described, despite growing 
      evidence of clinical involvement in premutation carriers. To address this 
      (apparent) paradox, we have determined, for 16 carrier males (55-192 repeats), 
      the relative levels of leukocyte FMR1 mRNA, by use of automated 
      fluorescence-detection reverse transcriptase-PCR, and the percent of lymphocytes 
      that are immunoreactive for FMR1 protein (FMRP). For some alleles with>100 
      repeats, there was a reduction in the number of FMRP-positive cells. 
      Unexpectedly, FMR1 mRNA levels were elevated at least fivefold within this same 
      range. No significant increase in FMR1 mRNA stability was observed in a 
      lymphoblastoid cell line (160 repeats) derived from one of the carrier males, 
      suggesting that the increased message levels are due to an increased rate of 
      transcription. Current results support a mechanism of involvement in premutation 
      carriers, in which reduced translational efficiency is at least partially 
      compensated through increased transcriptional activity. Thus, diminished 
      translational efficiency may be important throughout much of the premutation 
      range, with a mechanistic switch occurring in the full-mutation range as the FMR1 
      gene is silenced.

TI  - A serotonin transporter gene intron 2 polymorphic region, correlated with 
      affective disorders, has allele-dependent differential enhancer-like properties 
      in the mouse embryo.
PG  - 15251-5
AB  - Polymorphic regions consisting of a variable number of tandem repeats within 
      intron 2 of the gene coding for the serotonin transporter protein 5-HTT have been 
      associated with susceptibility to affective disorders. We have cloned two of 
      these intronic polymorphisms, Stin2.10 and Stin2.12, into an expression vector 
      containing a heterologous minimal promoter and the bacterial LacZ reporter gene. 
      These constructs were then used to produce transgenic mice. In embryonic day 10.5 
      embryos, both Stin2.10 and Stin2.12 produced consistent beta-galactosidase 
      expression in the embryonic midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord floor plate. 
      However, we observed that the levels of beta-galactosidase expression produced by 
      both the Stin2.10 and Stin2.12 within the rostral hindbrain differed 
      significantly at embryonic day 10.5. Our data suggest that these polymorphic 
      variable number of tandem repeats regions act as transcriptional regulators and 
      have allele-dependent differential enhancer-like properties within an area of the 
      hindbrain where the 5-HTT gene is known to be transcribed at this stage of 
      development.

TI  - Msh2 deficiency prevents in vivo somatic instability of the CAG repeat in 
      Huntington disease transgenic mice.
PG  - 471-3
AB  - Huntington disease (HD), an autosomal dominant, progressive neurodegenerative 
      disorder, is caused by an expanded CAG repeat sequence leading to an increase in 
      the number of glutamine residues in the encoded protein. The normal CAG repeat 
      range is 5-36, whereas 38 or more repeats are found in the diseased state; the 
      severity of disease is roughly proportional to the number of CAG repeats. HD 
      shows anticipation, in which subsequent generations display earlier disease 
      onsets due to intergenerational repeat expansion. For longer repeat lengths, 
      somatic instability of the repeat size has been observed both in human cases at 
      autopsy and in transgenic mouse models containing either a genomic fragment of 
      human HD exon 1 (ref. 9) or an expanded repeat inserted into the endogenous mouse 
      gene Hdh (ref. 10). With increasing repeat number, the protein changes 
      conformation and becomes increasingly prone to aggregation, suggesting important 
      functional correlations between repeat length and pathology. Because dinucleotide 
      repeat instability is known to increase when the mismatch repair enzyme MSH2 is 
      missing, we examined instability of the HD CAG repeat by crossing transgenic mice 
      carrying exon 1 of human HD (ref. 16) with Msh2-/- mice. Our results show that 
      Msh2 is required for somatic instability of the CAG repeat.

TI  - Isolation of an FMRP-associated messenger ribonucleoprotein particle and 
      identification of nucleolin and the fragile X-related proteins as components of 
      the complex.
PG  - 7925-32
AB  - The loss of FMR1 expression due to trinucleotide repeat expansion leads to 
      fragile X syndrome, a cause of mental retardation. The encoded protein, FMRP, is 
      a member of a gene family that also contains the fragile X-related proteins, 
      FXR1P and FXR2P. FMRP has been shown to be a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein 
      that selectively binds a subset of mRNAs, forms messenger ribonucleoprotein 
      (mRNP) complexes, and associates with translating ribosomes. Here we describe a 
      cell culture system from which we can isolate epitope-tagged FMRP along with 
      mRNA, including its own message, and at least six other proteins. We identify two 
      of these proteins as FXR1P and FXR2P by using specific antisera and identify a 
      third protein as nucleolin by using mass spectrometry. The presence of nucleolin 
      is confirmed by both reactivity with a specific antiserum as well as reverse 
      coimmunoprecipitation where antinucleolin antiserum immunoprecipitates endogenous 
      FMRP from both cultured cells and mouse brain. The identification of nucleolin, a 
      known component of other mRNPs, adds a new dimension to the analysis of FMRP 
      function, and the approach described should also allow the identification of the 
      remaining unknown proteins of this FMRP-associated mRNP as well as the other 
      bound mRNAs.

TI  - Evidence for the GluR6 gene associated with younger onset age of Huntington's 
      disease.
PG  - 1330-2
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is attributed to a triplet CAG repeat mutation, and 
      about half of the variation in onset age can be explained by the size of the 
      repeat expansion. Recently, a TAA repeat polymorphism in close linkage to the 
      kainate receptor, GluR6, was reported related to onset age in HD. We examined 
      this polymorphism in 258 unrelated HD-affected persons (172 from a clinic sample 
      and 86 from a postmortem series). This study confirms that the 155 allele is 
      associated with younger onset age of HD and suggests that it is in linkage 
      disequilibrium with a variant of the GluR6 gene or another gene in this region.

TI  - Clinical correlation of striatal 1H MRS changes in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 806-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical significance of metabolic alterations as 
      measured in vivo with proton MRS in the striatum of patients with Huntington's 
      disease (HD). METHODS: Localized, single-voxel MRS was performed on the basal 
      ganglia of 10 HD patients (4 presymptomatic gene carriers and 6 akinetic 
      patients) and 5 age-matched healthy individuals. Metabolite quantification was 
      performed by referring the areas of the respective spectral peaks to that of 
      water in the analyzed voxel. The spectroscopic findings were correlated with 
      motor and cognitive performance in several specific tests and with the length of 
      the CAG repeat expansion normalized for age. RESULTS: N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and 
      creatine were reduced markedly in both groups of patients, particularly in the 
      advanced group (approximately 60%), but the decrease was also significant in 
      presymptomatic patients (approximately 30%) whose motor and cognitive 
      performances were within the normal range. Both metabolites correlated highly 
      with the motor score of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale and with 
      computed measurements of saccadic and tapping speed. Creatine reduction was also 
      well correlated with performance in cognitive timed tasks and with the length of 
      CAG expansion (r = -0.81). CONCLUSION: The creatine signal appears to be an 
      interesting marker for progression in HD and could be useful in assessing 
      therapeutic outcome, particularly during the initial stages when most clinical 
      indices are still within the normal range.

TI  - The genetic analysis of Turkish patients with Huntington's disease.
PG  - 195-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Exploring the (CAG)n expansion within IT 15 gene in Turkish 
      Huntington's disease (HD) patients and its relation to downstream (CCG)n repeat 
      polymorphism to elucidate population specific haplotypic heterogeneity. METHODS: 
      Twenty-seven patients with clinical diagnosis of HD from 19 families were 
      sampled. The triplet repeats were evaluated by sizing the fluorescent PCR 
      products on an ABI 310 capillary gel electrophoresis unit. RESULTS: The number of 
      (CAG)n repeat expansions (range: 40-76, mean: 45.6+/-7) were inversely correlated 
      with age of onset (r=-0.81, P<0.0001). The (CCG)n polymorphism in HD chromosomes 
      was confined to (CCG)7 in all patients. In normal chromosomes CAG polymorphism 
      was accumulated at a relatively higher range (mean: 19.3+/-2.9) together with the 
      common occurrence of(CCG)7 and (CCG)10 alleles. CONCLUSION: The distribution 
      range of the CAG and CCG repeat polymorphism in normal chromosomes and strong 
      linkage disequilibrium between HD mutation and (CCG)7 haplotype provided a 
      striking similarity to populations of western European descent.

TI  - Transgenic mice expressing mutated full-length HD cDNA: a paradigm for locomotor 
      changes and selective neuronal loss in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 1035-45
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized clinically by motor and psychiatric disturbances and pathologically 
      by neuronal loss and gliosis (reactive astrocytosis) particularly in the striatum 
      and cerebral cortex. We have recently created HD full-length cDNA transgenic 
      mouse models that may serve as a paradigm for HD. A more detailed 
      characterization of these models is presented here. The transgene encoding normal 
      huntingtin consists of 9417 bp of the huntingtin coding sequences including 16 
      tandem CAGs coding for polyglutamines as part of exon 1. The transgene is driven 
      by a heterologous cytomegalovirus promoter. Five independent transgenic mouse 
      lines were obtained using this construct. An additional six transgenic lines were 
      obtained using full-length HD constructs that have been modified to include 
      either 48 or 89 CAG repeat expansions. Southern blot and densitometric analyses 
      indicated unique integration sites for the transgene in each of the lines with a 
      copy number ranging from two to 22 copies. Widespread expression of the transgene 
      in brain, heart, spleen, kidney, lung, liver and gonads from each line was 
      determined by Western blot analyses. In the brain, transgene expression was found 
      in cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum. Expression of the 
      transgene was as much as five times the endogenous mouse huntingtin level. 
      Phenotypically, only mice expressing 48 or 89 CAG repeats manifested progressive 
      behavioural and motor dysfunction. Early behavioural abnormalities were 
      characterized by trunk curling and clasping of both fore- and hindlimbs when the 
      animals were suspended by their tails. Subsequently, these mice exhibited 
      hyperkinetic movements, including heightened exploratory activities, 
      unidirectional rotational behaviour, backflipping and excessive grooming that 
      lasted for several weeks. Eventually, the animals progressed to a hypokinetic 
      phase consisting of slowed movements and lack of response to sensory stimuli. 
      Urine retention or incontinence was also a prominent feature of the hypokinetic 
      phase. At the end stage of the disease process, HD48(B,D) and HD89(A-C) mice 
      became akinetic just prior to death. Neuropathological examination of mice at 
      various stages indicated that it was only during the hypokinetic phase and 
      thereafter when selective neuronal loss was most apparent. Regions of 
      neurodegeneration and loss included the striatum, cerebral cortex, thalamus and 
      hippocampus. TUNEL staining indicated an apoptotic mode of cell death in these 
      brain regions. Comparative neuronal counts after Nissl staining showed as much as 
      20% loss of small and medium neurons in the striatum in mice at the hypokinetic 
      and akinetic stages. Reactive astrocytosis accompanied the areas of 
      neurodegeneration and loss. Polyglutamine aggregates in the form of neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusions and diffuse nuclear and perinuclear aggregations were 
      found in a small percentage of neurons, including those in brain regions that are 
      typically spared in HD. This observation suggests that polyglutamine aggregates 
      may not be sufficient to cause neuronal loss in HD. In both behavioural and 
      neuropathological analyses, wild-type and transgenic animals with 16 CAG repeats 
      were indistinguishable from each other and do not exhibit the changes observed 
      for mice carrying the 48 and 89 CAG repeat mutations. Thus, animals expressing 
      the CAG repeat expansions appear to represent clinically analogous models for HD 
      pathogenesis, and may also provide insights into the underlying 
      pathophysiological mechanisms of other triplet repeat disorders.

TI  - From neuronal inclusions to neurodegeneration: neuropathological investigation of 
      a transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease.
PG  - 971-9
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited progressive neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine repeat sequence within a novel 
      protein. Recent work has shown that abnormal intranuclear inclusions of 
      aggregated mutant protein within neurons is a characteristic feature shared by HD 
      and several other diseases involving glutamine repeat expansion. This suggests 
      that in each of the these disorders the affected nerve cells degenerate as a 
      result of these abnormal inclusions. A transgenic mouse model of HD has been 
      generated by introducing exon 1 of the HD gene containing a highly expanded CAG 
      sequence into the mouse germline. These mice develop widespread neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusions and neurodegeneration specifically within those areas of 
      the brain known to degenerate in HD. We have investigated the sequence of 
      pathological changes that occur after the formation of nuclear inclusions and 
      that precede neuronal cell death in these cells. Although the relation between 
      inclusion formation and neurodegeneration has recently been questioned, a full 
      characterization of the pathways linking protein aggregation and cell death will 
      resolve some of these controversies and will additionally provide new targets for 
      potential therapies.

TI  - Neuroticism and polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene.
PG  - 735-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is evidence for an association between two different 
      polymorphisms of the human serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT) and the personality 
      trait of neuroticism and affective disorder. METHODS: We studied the association 
      between neuroticism and polymorphisms in the 5HTT-linked promoter region and in a 
      variable number tandem repeat region (VNTR) of the 5-HTT gene in 204 people aged 
      over 60 derived from a random sample of men and women in the general population. 
      Approximately half of the subjects were in the top 20% of neuroticism scorers and 
      half in the bottom 20%. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in allelic 
      or genotypic frequencies between the high and low neuroticism scorers. There was 
      highly significant linkage disequilibrium between the two 5-HTT gene 
      polymorphisms, and haplotype analysis showed no association between neuroticism 
      level and haplotype. CONCLUSIONS: Reports of an association between two 5-HTT 
      gene polymorphisms and the personality trait of neuroticism are not supported by 
      these results.

TI  - Sanjad-Sakati and autosomal recessive Kenny-Caffey syndromes are allelic: 
      evidence for an ancestral founder mutation and locus refinement.
PG  - 48-52
AB  - The Sanjad-Sakati syndrome (SSS; MIM241410), an autosomal recessive trait 
      characterized by congenital hypoparathyroidism, growth and mental retardation, 
      seizures, and a characteristic physiognomy, was recently linked to chromosome 
      area 1q42-q43. SSS resembles the autosomal recessive form of Kenny-Caffey 
      syndrome (KCS; MIM244460), with similar manifestations but lacking 
      osteosclerosis. Since KCS was recently linked to the region 1q42-q43, the 
      possibility that this disorder is allelic with SSS was considered. Eight 
      Sanjad-Sakati families from Saudi Arabia were genotyped with polymorphic short 
      tandem repeat markers from the SSS/KCS critical region. A maximum multipoint LOD 
      score of 14.32 was obtained at marker D1S2649, confirming linkage of SSS to the 
      same region as autosomal recessive KCS. Haplotype analysis refined the critical 
      region to 2.6 cM and identified a rare haplotype present in all the SSS disease 
      alleles, indicative of a common founder. In addition to the assignment of the 
      Saudi SSS and Kuwaiti KCS syndromes to overlapping genetic intervals, comparison 
      of the haplotypes unexpectedly demonstrated that the diseases shared an identical 
      haplotype. This finding, combined with the clinical similarity between the two 
      syndromes, suggests that the two conditions are not only allelic but are also 
      caused by the same ancestral mutation.

TI  - Behavioral effects of tryptophan depletion in seasonal affective disorder 
      associated with the serotonin transporter gene?
PG  - 241-6
AB  - There is some evidence that the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 
      5-HT) may be involved in the pathogenesis of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). 
      Short-term tryptophan (TRP) depletion was carried out in 18 drug-free remitted 
      patients who met DSM-IV criteria for SAD. Behavioral effects were measured with 
      the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) both 24 h before and 24 h after TRP 
      depletion. Some of the patients showed behavioral responses such as lowered mood, 
      feelings of guilt, loss of interest, agitation, loss of energy, fatigue, social 
      withdrawal, increased appetite, and carbohydrate craving. It was the aim of our 
      study to investigate whether the genotypes of the serotonin transporter gene were 
      associated with symptoms of transient depressive relapse after TRP depletion. In 
      addition, we matched the SAD patients with healthy control subjects to see if 
      alleles and genotypes of the serotonin transporter gene were associated with SAD. 
      High molecular weight DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes using 
      standard methods. For the 5-HTT receptor gene, a 17-bp repetitive element of 
      intron 2 was genotyped (variable number tandem repeat, VNTR). Alterations in HDRS 
      scores after TRP depletion showed no significant association with alleles or 
      genotypes of the 5-HTT gene, although heterozygotes showed a trend toward 
      increased HDRS scores. The serotonin transporter is known to play a critical role 
      in the termination of serotonergic neurotransmission by sodium-dependent uptake 
      of 5-HT into the presynaptic neuron. The present study in a small group of SAD 
      patients was unable to demonstrate that the 5-HTT gene plays a role in the 
      pathogenesis of SAD or in short-term depressive relapse after TRP depletion.

TI  - Self-assembly of polyglutamine-containing huntingtin fragments into amyloid-like 
      fibrils: implications for Huntington's disease pathology.
PG  - 4604-9
AB  - Huntington's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      polyglutamine [poly(Q)] repeat expansion in the first exon of the huntingtin 
      protein. Previously, we showed that N-terminal huntingtin peptides with poly(Q) 
      tracts in the pathological range (51-122 glutamines), but not with poly(Q) tracts 
      in the normal range (20 and 30 glutamines), form high molecular weight protein 
      aggregates with a fibrillar or ribbon-like morphology, reminiscent of scrapie 
      prion rods and beta-amyloid fibrils in Alzheimer's disease. Here we report that 
      the formation of amyloid-like huntingtin aggregates in vitro not only depends on 
      poly(Q) repeat length but also critically depends on protein concentration and 
      time. Furthermore, the in vitro aggregation of huntingtin can be seeded by 
      preformed fibrils. Together, these results suggest that amyloid fibrillogenesis 
      in Huntington's disease, like in Alzheimer's disease, is a nucleation-dependent 
      polymerization.

TI  - Formation of polyglutamine inclusions in non-CNS tissue.
PG  - 813-22
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is one of a class of inherited progressive 
      neurodegenerative disorders that are caused by a CAG/polyglutamine repeat 
      expansion. We have previously generated mice that are transgenic for exon 1 of 
      the HD gene carrying highly expanded CAG repeats which develop a progressive 
      movement disorder and weight loss with similarities to HD. Neuronal inclusions 
      composed of the exon 1 protein and ubiquitin are present in specific brain 
      regions prior to onset of the phenotype, which in turn occurs long before 
      specific neurodegeneration can be detected. In this report we have extended the 
      search for polyglutamine inclusions to non-neuronal tissues. Outside the central 
      nervous system (CNS), inclusions were identified in a variety of post-mitotic 
      cells. This is consistent with a concentration-dependent nucleation and 
      aggregation model of inclusion formation and indicates that brain-specific 
      factors are not necessary for this process. To possibly gain insights into the 
      wasting that is observed in the human disease, we have conducted a detailed 
      analysis of the timing and progression of inclusion formation in skeletal muscle 
      and an investigation into the cause of the severe muscle atrophy that occurs in 
      the mouse model. The formation of inclusions in non-CNS tissues will be 
      particularly useful with respect to in vivo monitoring of pharmaceutical agents 
      selected for their ability to prevent polyglutamine aggregation in vitro, without 
      the requirement that the agent can cross the blood-brain barrier in the first 
      instance.

TI  - Imprinting of a RING zinc-finger encoding gene in the mouse chromosome region 
      homologous to the Prader-Willi syndrome genetic region.
PG  - 795-803
AB  - A novel locus in the human Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) region encodes the 
      imprinted ZNF127 and antisense ZNF127AS genes. Here, we show that the mouse 
      ZNF127 ortholog, Zfp127, encodes a homologous putative zinc-finger polypeptide, 
      with a RING (C3HC4) and three C3H zinc-finger domains that suggest function as a 
      ribonucleoprotein. By the use of RT-PCR across an in-frame hexamer tandem repeat 
      and RNA from a Mus musculus x M.spretus F1interspecific cross, we show that 
      Zfp127 is expressed only from the paternal allele in brain, heart and kidney. 
      Similarly, Zfp127 is expressed in differentiated cells derived from androgenetic 
      embryonic stem cells and normal embryos but not those from parthogenetic 
      embryonic stem cells. We hypothesize that the gametic imprint may be set, at 
      least in part, by the transcriptional activity of Zfp127 in pre- and post-meiotic 
      male germ cells. Therefore, Zfp127 is a novel imprinted gene that may play a role 
      in the imprinted phenotype of mouse models of PWS.

TI  - Low-copy repeats mediate the common 3-Mb deletion in patients with 
      velo-cardio-facial syndrome.
PG  - 1076-86
AB  - Velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS) is the most common microdeletion syndrome in 
      humans. It occurs with an estimated frequency of 1 in 4, 000 live births. Most 
      cases occur sporadically, indicating that the deletion is recurrent in the 
      population. More than 90% of patients with VCFS and a 22q11 deletion have a 
      similar 3-Mb hemizygous deletion, suggesting that sequences at the breakpoints 
      confer susceptibility to rearrangements. To define the region containing the 
      chromosome breakpoints, we constructed an 8-kb-resolution physical map. We 
      identified a low-copy repeat in the vicinity of both breakpoints. A set of 
      genetic markers were integrated into the physical map to determine whether the 
      deletions occur within the repeat. Haplotype analysis with genetic markers that 
      flank the repeats showed that most patients with VCFS had deletion breakpoints in 
      the repeat. Within the repeat is a 200-kb duplication of sequences, including a 
      tandem repeat of genes/pseudogenes, surrounding the breakpoints. The genes in the 
      repeat are GGT, BCRL, V7-rel, POM121-like, and GGT-rel. Physical mapping and 
      genomic fingerprint analysis showed that the repeats are virtually identical in 
      the 200-kb region, suggesting that the deletion is mediated by homologous 
      recombination. Examination of two three-generation families showed that meiotic 
      intrachromosomal recombination mediated the deletion.

TI  - A novel PCR-based approach for the detection of the Huntington disease associated 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion.
PG  - 232-6
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      associated with expansions of an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat in exon 1 of 
      the IT15 gene. In normal individuals, IT15 contains up to 35 CAG repeats, while 
      in affected the repeat length is >36. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to 
      estimate the number of CAG repeats but may be inefficient in long repeats because 
      of the high C+G content of the HD locus. We present a novel PCR approach for the 
      diagnosis of HD, which permits direct visualization of the amplified products on 
      agarose gel, using ethidium bromide. It is based on the methylation-sensitive 
      conversion of C residues to U by bisulfite treatment of single-stranded DNA and 
      subsequent amplification of the sense strand with specific primers. The bisulfite 
      treatment dramatically reduces the C + G content of the region; thus, the high Tm 
      and stable secondary structures are no longer obstacles to PCR. In both normal 
      and affected individuals, UAG repeats (5'- CAG-3', before bisulfite treatment) in 
      the sense strand can easily be amplified and visualized on a gel by ethidium 
      bromide staining. The method has considerable advantages compared with other 
      described PCR-based diagnostic tests for HD.

TI  - Neuronal degeneration in the basal ganglia and loss of pallido-subthalamic 
      synapses in mice with targeted disruption of the Huntington's disease gene.
PG  - 468-79
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated 
      with CAG repeat expansion within a novel gene (IT15). We have previously created 
      a targeted disruption in exon 5 of Hdh (Hdhex5), the murine homologue of the HD 
      gene. Homozygotes for the Hdhex5 mutation exhibit embryolethality before 
      embryonic day 8.5, while heterozygotes survive to adulthood and display increased 
      motor activity and cognitive deficits. Detailed morphometric and stereological 
      analyses of the basal ganglia in adult heterozygous mice were performed by light 
      and electron microscopy. Morphometric analyses demonstrated a significant loss of 
      neurons from both the globus pallidus (29%) and the subthalamic nucleus (51%), 
      with a normal complement of neurons in the caudate-putamen and substantia nigra. 
      The ultrastructural appearance of sporadic degenerating neurons in these regions 
      indicated apoptosis. The highest frequency of apoptotic neurons was observed in 
      the globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus. Stereological analyses in the 
      subthalamic nucleus revealed a significant decrease in the numerical density of 
      symmetric synapses (43%), suggesting a relatively selective loss of inhibitory 
      pallido-subthalamic afferents. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies against 
      enkephalin and substance-P was unremarkable in heterozygotes, indicating a normal 
      complement of enkephalin-immunoreactive striatopallidal afferents and 
      substance-P-immunoreactive striatopeduncular and striatonigral afferents in these 
      animals. These findings show that loss of an intact huntingtin protein is 
      associated with significant morphological alterations in the basal ganglia of 
      adult mice, indicating an important role for this protein during development of

TI  - Histochemical and genetic analysis of colonic mucin glycoproteins in 
      Hirschsprung's disease.
PG  - 330-3
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Mucin glycoproteins (mucins) recently have been shown to be 
      deficient in the colonic mucosa of patients with Hirschsprung's disease (HD). The 
      authors performed a detailed histo- and immunohistochemical analysis of mucins in 
      the colonic mucosa and studied the expression of mucin genes to characterize 
      histologically mucin quality and gene expression in HD compared with controls. 
      METHODS: Paraffin-embedded 4-microm thick sections from patients with HD (n = 11 
      ganglionic, 10 aganglionic) and controls (n = 19) were taken. Slides were stained 
      with mild periodic acid Schiff with and without saponification with KOH (reacts 
      with O-actylated mucins), high iron diamine/alcian blue (differentiates sulphated 
      v nonsulphated mucins), the monoclonal antimucin antibodies, PR3A5 (against di- 
      and tri-O-acetylated sialic acids) and 91.9H (against sulphated mucins). 
      O-acetylation and sulphation both confer an increased resistance of mucins to 
      bacterial degradation and are thought to be important in the defensive function 
      of the colonic mucus gel layer. In situ hybridization was used to study 
      expression of the mucin genes MUC 1, 2, 3, 4, 5AC, 5B, 6, 7, and 8. 
      [35S]-sulphate-labelled antisense oligonucleotide 48mer probes designed to the 
      known tandem repeat domains of MUC genes were used. After hybridization and 
      washing the slides were opposed to Hyperfilm MP for 7 days. The autoradiographs 
      were scored by three independent observers for differences in expression and by 
      image analysis. Those with positive findings were dipped in photographic 
      emulsion, developed, and counterstained for photomicrographs. RESULTS: There were 
      different patterns of staining dependent on the region of the colon and 
      especially the age of the patient with three reagents. No significant differences 
      in the histological staining pattern was detected between HD patients and 
      controls. The colonic mucins in HD were found to be primarily O-acetylated and 
      sulphated. The MUC gene expression was similar in patients and controls. MUC2 and 
      4 were strongly expressed, MUC1, 3, and 5B had moderate to weak expression, and 
      MUC 5AB, 6, 7, and 8 had baseline expression. CONCLUSIONS: The mucin 
      glycoproteins in children with HD, although quantitatively deficient, show no 
      qualitative differences on histo- and immunohistochemical staining from normal 
      controls. The expression of all the known mucin genes, the genetic control of 
      mucin secretion, and the quality of mucins, is similar to normal controls.

TI  - Analysis of CAG repeat expansion in Huntington's disease gene (IT 15) in a 
      Hungarian population.
PG  - 107-10
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with autosomal dominant 
      inheritance. The genetic defect is a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion at the 5' 
      end of the IT 15 gene on chromosome 4. This gene has not been analyzed in the 
      Hungarian population yet. To obtain data DNA from 26 HD patients, 18 members of 
      their families and 70 normal controls was amplified in the involved region by 
      polymerase chain reaction. The CAG repeat numbers varied from 37 to 70 (median: 
      43) in HD patients and asymptomatic carriers, while individuals of the normal 
      control group had 10-36 CAG repeat numbers (median: 18). The length of CAG repeat 
      expansion in Hungarian HD patients was similar to that reported from other 
      countries. The group of normal controls had the same CAG repeat expansion as 
      populations reported from Western European countries. It is a useful piece of 
      data for population genetics to prove that the population of Hungary is a melange 
      of different nations that influenced the history of the country in the last 11 
      centuries. As opposed to this, the only closely related nation, the Finnish, was 
      genetically more isolated during this time, so the frequency of HD (and also the 
      number of CAG repeats in normal individuals) proved to be exceptionally low.

TI  - Intranuclear inclusions and neuritic aggregates in transgenic mice expressing a 
      mutant N-terminal fragment of huntingtin.
PG  - 397-407
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited, neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      the expansion of a glutamine repeat in the N-terminus of the huntingtin protein. 
      To gain insight into the pathogenesis of HD, we generated transgenic mice that 
      express a cDNA encoding an N-terminal fragment (171 amino acids) of huntingtin 
      with 82, 44 or 18 glutamines. Mice expressing relatively low steady-state levels 
      of N171 huntingtin with 82 glutamine repeats (N171-82Q) develop behavioral 
      abnormalities, including loss of coordination, tremors, hypokinesis and abnormal 
      gait, before dying prematurely. In mice exhibiting these abnormalities, diffuse 
      nuclear labeling, intranuclear inclusions and neuritic aggregates, all 
      immunoreactive with an antibody to the N-terminus (amino acids 1-17) of 
      huntingtin (AP194), were found in multiple populations of neurons. None of these 
      behavioral or pathological phenotypes were seen in mice expressing N171-18Q. 
      These findings are consistent with the idea that N-terminal fragments of 
      huntingtin with a repeat expansion are toxic to neurons, and that N-terminal 
      fragments are prone to form both intranuclear inclusions and neuritic aggregates.

AB  - A patient with juvenile Huntington's disease (HD) of probable maternal 
      inheritance is reported. The expanded IT-15 allele was only detected with the use 
      of modified PCR and Southern transfer techniques, which showed a CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion of approximately 250 repeats-the largest CAG

TI  - FMR1 gene expression in olfactory neuroblasts from two males with fragile X 
      syndrome.
PG  - 25-30
AB  - The fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) mutation is strongly correlated 
      with specific and marked neurobehavioral and neuroanatomical abnormalities. The 
      protein product, FMRP, is highly expressed in neurons of the normal mammalian 
      brain, and absent or in low levels in leukocytes from individuals with fragile X 
      (FraX)-associated mental impairment. Inferences which arise from these findings 
      are that FMRP has a critical role in the development and functioning of the 
      brain, and that leukocyte-derived molecular assessments provide a good indicator 
      of FMR1 expression in that organ. This latter conclusion appears true in most 
      cases even though the typical FMR1 mutation is an unstable triplet repeat 
      expansion which demonstrates somatic heterogeneity within and across tissues. 
      Blood to brain correspondence in FraX patients has only rarely been confirmed by 
      the direct study of human brain specimens and, to our knowledge, it has never 
      been studied in living individuals with the FMR1 mutation. In this report, we 
      describe the FMR1 patterns in olfactory neuroblasts (ON) from two living brothers 
      with expansion mutations in their leukocytes who are mentally retarded and 
      autistic. ON were chosen for study because they are accessible neurons closely 
      linked to the brain. In both subjects, the ON genotype was highly, but not 
      perfectly, consistent with that observed in leukocytes. Protein phenotypes across 
      tissues were completely consistent showing the absence of FMRP-immunoreactivity 
      (-ir). These results augment the limited amount of direct evidence which 
      indicates that FMR1 mutation patterns in leukocytes are a good, albeit 
      potentially fallible, reflection of such patterns in the brain. This report 
      further demonstrates the feasibility of using ON samples to evaluate the FMR1 
      mutation in humans in vivo.

TI  - Re-examination of factors associated with expansion of CGG repeats using a single 
      nucleotide polymorphism in FMR1.
PG  - 1935-46
AB  - In at least 98% of fragile X syndrome cases, the disease results from expansion 
      of the CGG repeat in the 5' end of FMR1. The use of microsatellite markers in the 
      FMR1 region has revealed a disparity of risk between haplotypes for CGG repeat 
      expansion. Although instability appears to depend on both the haplotype and the 
      AGG interspersion pattern of the repeat, these factors alone do not completely 
      describe the molecular basis for the linkage disequilibrium between normal and 
      fragile X chromosomes, in part due to instability of the marker loci themselves. 
      In an effort to better understand the mechanism of dynamic mutagenesis, we have 
      searched for and discovered a single nucleotide polymorphism in intron 1 of FMR1 
      and characterized this marker, called ATL1, in 564 normal and 152 fragile X 
      chromosomes. The G allele of this marker is found in 40% of normal chromosomes, 
      in contrast to 83% of fragile X chromosomes. Not only is the G allele exclusively 
      linked to haplotypes over-represented in fragile X syndrome, but G allele 
      chromosomes also appear to transition to instability at a higher rate on 
      haplotypes negatively associated with risk of expansion. The two alleles of ATL1 
      also reveal a highly significant linkage disequilibrium between unstable 
      chromosomes and the 5' end of the CGG repeat itself, specifically the position of 
      the first AGG interruption. The data expand the number of haplotypes associated 
      with FMR1 and specifically allow discrimination, by ATL1 alleles, of single 
      haplotypes with differing predispositions to expansion. Such haplotypes should 
      prove useful in further defining the mechanism of dynamic mutagenesis.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of the rat huntingtin promoter.
PG  - 227-34
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a (CAG)>37 
      repeat expansion in a novel gene of unknown function. Although the huntingtin 
      gene is expressed in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues, the disease affects nerve 
      cells of selected regional areas of the central nervous system. To gain insight 
      into the regulation of the HD gene we analysed 1348 bp of the rat huntingtin 
      promoter region. This region lacks a TATA and a CAAT box, is rich in GC content 
      and has several consensus sequences for binding sites for SP1, PEA3, Sif and H2A. 
      The stretch between nucleotides -56 and -206 relative to the first ATG is highly 
      conserved between human and rodents and it harbours several potential binding 
      sites for transcription factors. We analysed deletion mutants fused with the 
      chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in transfected, HD-expressing 
      neuronal (NS20Y, NG108-15) and non-neuronal Chinese hamster ovary cell lines. 
      Hence these cells should contain the required trans-acting factors necessary for 
      HD gene expression. Partial deletion of the evolutionarily conserved part of the 
      promoter significantly decreases the activity in both neuronal and non-neuronal 
      cells, indicating that the core promoter activity is located between nucleotides 
      -332 and -15. DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays were 
      used to define the nucleotide positions and binding affinity of DNA-protein 
      interactions.

TI  - The autosomal recessive Kenny-Caffey syndrome locus maps to chromosome 1q42-q43.
PG  - 13-8
AB  - Kenny-Caffey syndrome (KCS) is an osteosclerotic bone dysplasia with associated 
      hypocalcemia and ocular abnormalities. Both autosomal dominant (MIM127000) and 
      autosomal recessive (MIM244460) inheritance patterns have been described. Using 
      eight consanguineous Kuwaiti kindreds, a genome-wide search for linkage to the 
      gene causing the autosomal recessive form of KCS was performed with polymorphic 
      short tandem repeat markers. Significant linkage to a locus situated at 
      chromosome 1q42 --> q43 with a maximal two-point lod score of 13.30 with marker 
      D1S2649 was obtained. Haplotype analysis of flanking markers identified 
      recombination events defining the KCS locus to a region between markers D1S2800 
      on the centromeric boundary and D1S2850 on the telomeric boundary, an 
      approximately 4-cM interval. All affected individuals in these unrelated kindreds 
      were homozygous for identical alleles at markers D1S2649 and D1S235, suggesting a 
      single ancestral mutation underlying the disease in these families. 
      Haploinsufficiency at 22q11, reported in another consanguineous KCS kindred, was 
      not documented in these families.

TI  - A Huntington disease-like neurodegenerative disorder maps to chromosome 20p.
PG  - 1431-8
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by motor disturbance, cognitive loss, and psychiatric 
      manifestations. The disease is associated with a CAG trinucleotide-repeat 
      expansion in the Huntington gene (IT15) on chromosome 4p16.3. One family with a 
      history of HD was referred to us initially for predictive testing using linkage 
      analysis. However, the chromosome 4p region was completely excluded by 
      polymorphic markers, and later no CAG-repeat expansion in the HD gene was 
      detected. To map the disease trait segregating in this family, whole-genome 
      screening with highly polymorphic dinucleotide-, trinucleotide-, and 
      tetranucleotide-repeat DNA markers was performed. A positive LOD score of 3.01 
      was obtained for the marker D20S482 on chromosome 20p, by two-point LOD-score 
      analysis with the MLINK program. Haplotype analysis indicated that the gene 
      responsible for the disease is likely located in a 2.7-cM region between the 
      markers D20S193 and D20S895. Candidate genes from the mapping region were 
      screened for mutations.

TI  - Polyglutamine-expanded human huntingtin transgenes induce degeneration of 
      Drosophila photoreceptor neurons.
PG  - 633-42
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder. 
      Disease alleles contain a trinucleotide repeat expansion of variable length, 
      which encodes polyglutamine tracts near the amino terminus of the HD protein, 
      huntingtin. Polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin, but not normal huntingtin, forms 
      nuclear inclusions. We describe a Drosophila model for HD. Amino-terminal 
      fragments of human huntingtin containing tracts of 2, 75, and 120 glutamine 
      residues were expressed in photoreceptor neurons in the compound eye. As in human 
      neurons, polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin induced neuronal degeneration. The age 
      of onset and severity of neuronal degeneration correlated with repeat length, and 
      nuclear localization of huntingtin presaged neuronal degeneration. In contrast to 
      other cell death paradigms in Drosophila, coexpression of the viral antiapoptotic 
      protein, P35, did not rescue the cell death phenotype induced by 
      polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin.

TI  - Evolution of the primate androgen receptor: a structural basis for disease.
PG  - 334-42
AB  - Androgen effects mediated by the androgen receptor (AR) are essential for male 
      reproductive development and virilization. Comparison of AR DNA coding sequence 
      from five primate species, Homo sapiens (human), Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee), 
      Papio hamadryas (baboon), Macaca fascicularis (macaque), and Eulemur fulvus 
      collaris (collared brown lemur), supports their phylogeny with complete 
      conservation of the DNA and steroid binding domain protein sequence. A linear 
      increase in trinucleotide repeat expansion of homologous CAG and GGC sequences 
      occurs in the NH2-terminal transcriptional activation region and is proportional 
      to the time of species divergence. A serine phosphate/glutamine repeat 
      interaction is observed where increasing CAG repeat length is associated with an 
      increased rate of serine 94 phosphorylation. Disparity in the calculated and 
      apparent molecular weight with CAG repeat expansion of an AR NH2-terminal 
      fragment suggests self-aggregation with increasing glutamine repeat length into 
      the pathological range. These results suggest that a CAG/glutamine repeat 
      expanded during divergence of the higher primate species, which may have a direct 
      effect on AR structure and support a common pathway in CAG trigenic diseases in 
      the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration observed in X-linked spinal bulbar and 
      muscular atrophy.

TI  - Susceptibility for schizophrenia is not influenced by a functional 
      insertion/deletion variant in the promoter of the serotonin transporter gene.
PG  - 82-6
AB  - A possible dysregulation of serotonergic neurotransmission has been implicated in 
      the aetiology of schizophrenic psychoses. In the present study we analysed 
      allelic and genotypic variations of a recently described functional polymorphic 
      region in the promoter of the human serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) and a 
      variable tandem repeat (VNTR) in intron 2 of the 5-HTT gene. We investigated 413 
      unrelated individuals, 180 schizophrenic patients and 233 blood donors as 
      controls. With regard to the 5-HTTLPR, both the schizophrenic and the control 
      group did not significantly differ between genotype frequencies (chi2, p = 0.920) 
      and allele frequencies (chi2, p = 0.836). The odds ratio for subjects with 
      schizophrenia who were homozygous for the short allele was 1.04 (95% CI 
      0.59-1.84). No evidence of allelic association to specific schizophrenia subtypes 
      was found. The 5-HTT associated VNTR also showed no significant differences 
      between either the allelic or the genotypic distributions. Haplotype analysis 
      revealed a significant overall linkage disequilibrium at a level of p = 0.00004. 
      Our findings indicate that both polymorphisms are unlikely to play a substantial 
      role in the genetic predisposition to schizophrenic disorders.

TI  - Patients with features similar to Huntington's disease, without CAG expansion in 
      huntingtin.
PG  - 215-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe characteristics of gene-negative patients with clinical 
      features of Huntington's disease (HD), exploring likely etiologies. BACKGROUND: 
      When a direct gene test became definitive for diagnosis of HD, we discovered a 
      number of patients in our clinics in Baltimore, MD, and Cambridge, UK, believed 
      or suspected to have HD who did not have the triplet repeat expansion. METHODS: 
      Patients were examined using standardized instruments, and given full neurologic 
      and psychiatric evaluations. Those negative for HD were tested for 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy, SCA-1, SCA-3, SCA-2, SCA-6, and other 
      conditions as indicated. RESULTS: Of 15 patients, 7 received specific diagnoses 
      or appear to be sporadic cases, 4 have a possible but uncertain relation to HD, 
      and 4 have unknown familial progressive movement disorders. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      last group of patients might be properly described as phenocopies of HD, some of 
      which may be caused by unidentified triplet repeat expansions.

TI  - Intranuclear neuronal inclusions in Huntington's disease and dentatorubral and 
      pallidoluysian atrophy: correlation between the density of inclusions and IT15 
      CAG triplet repeat length.
PG  - 387-97
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by CAG triplet repeat expansion in IT15 which 
      leads to polyglutamine stretches in the HD protein product, huntingtin. The 
      pathological hallmark of HD is the degeneration of subsets of neurons, primarily 
      those in the striatum and neocortex. Specific morphological markers of affected 
      cells have not been identified in patients with HD, although a unique itranuclear 
      inclusion was recently reported in neurons of transgenic animals expressing a 
      construct encoding the N-terminal part (including the glutamine repeat) of 
      huntingtin (Davies et al., 1997). In order to understand the importance of this 
      finding, we sought for comparable nuclear abnormalities in autopsy material from 
      patients with HD. In all 20 HD cases examined, anti-ubiquitin and N-terminal 
      huntingtin antibodies identified itranuclear inclusions in neurons and the 
      frequency of these lesions correlated with the length of the CAG repeat in IT15. 
      In addition, examination of material from the related HD-like triplet repeat 
      disorder, dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy, also revealed intranuclear 
      neuronal inclusions. These findings suggest that intranuclear inclusions 
      containing protein aggregates may be common feature of the pathogenesis of 
      glutamine repeat neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - Purified recombinant Fmrp exhibits selective RNA binding as an intrinsic property 
      of the fragile X mental retardation protein.
PG  - 15521-7
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is caused by the transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene 
      due to a trinucleotide repeat expansion. The encoded protein, Fmrp, has been 
      found to be a nucleocytoplasmic RNA-binding protein containing both KH domains 
      and RGG boxes that associates with polyribosomes as a ribonucleoprotein particle. 
      RNA binding has previously been demonstrated with in vitro-translated Fmrp; 
      however, it remained uncertain whether the selective RNA binding observed was an 
      intrinsic property of Fmrp or required an associated protein(s). Here, 
      baculovirus-expressed and affinity-purified FLAG-tagged murine Fmrp was shown to 
      bind directly to both ribonucleotide homopolymers and human brain mRNA. FLAG-Fmrp 
      exhibited selectivity for binding poly(G) > poly(U) >> poly(C) or poly(A). 
      Moreover, purified FLAG-Fmrp bound to only a subset of brain mRNA, including the 
      3' untranslated regions of myelin basic protein message and its own message. 
      Recombinant isoform 4, lacking the RGG boxes but maintaining both KH domains, was 
      also purified and was found to only weakly interact with RNA. FLAG-purified I304N 
      Fmrp, harboring the mutation of severe fragile X syndrome, demonstrated RNA 
      binding, in contrast to previous suggestions. These data demonstrate the 
      intrinsic property of Fmrp to selectively bind RNA and show FLAG-Fmrp as a 
      suitable reagent for structural characterization and identification of cognate 
      RNA ligands.

TI  - Serotonin transporter gene and risk for bipolar affective disorder: an 
      association study in Spanish population.
PG  - 843-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is an important candidate gene for 
      the genetic transmission of manic depressive illness. Many studies of patients 
      with affective disorders have found abnormalities in serotonin metabolism and 
      dysregulation of the transporter itself. In the present study, we hypothesize 
      that genetic variation in the 5-HTT gene (17q11.1-17q12) may have an effect in 
      the etiology of manic depression. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 
      allele, genotype, and haplotype frequencies of two polymorphisms recently 
      described in the 5-HTT gene (a variable number of tandem repeats in intron 2 and 
      a deletion/insertion polymorphism in the transcriptional control region) in a 
      sample of 88 patients with manic-depressive illness and 113 controls. Cases and 
      controls were matched for ethnic and geographic origin. RESULTS: No associations 
      were found between any of these polymorphisms, tested individually or as 
      haplotypes, and manic depression. Moreover, the genetic analysis by sex, 
      presence/absence of psychiatric family history, and age of onset did not reveal 
      significant differences in allele or genotype distributions. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results suggest that the genetic variability of the 5-HTT gene is not a major 
      risk factor for manic depression.

TI  - Huntingtin protein colocalizes with lesions of neurodegenerative diseases: An 
      investigation in Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Pick's diseases.
PG  - 213-22
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease 
      associated with a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in a large gene on 
      chromosome 4. The gene encodes the protein huntingtin with a polyglutamine tract 
      encoded by the CAG repeat at the N-terminus. The number of CAG repeats in HD are 
      significantly increased (36 to 120+) compared with the normal population (8-39). 
      The pathological mechanism associated with the expanded CAG repeat in HD is not 
      clear but there is evidence that polyglutamine is directly neurotoxic. We have 
      immunolocalized huntingtin with an in-house, well-characterised, polyclonal 
      antibody in HD, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Picks disease (PiD) brains. Control 
      brain tissue sections were from head injured and cerebral ischaemia cases. In HD, 
      huntingtin was immunopositive in the surviving but damaged neurons and reactive 
      astrocytes of the caudate and putamen. However, in AD and PiD the immunostaining 
      was largely restricted to the characteristic intracellular inclusion bodies 
      associated with the disease process in each case. In AD, huntingtin was localized 
      only in the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and dystrophic neurites within 
      the neuritic amyloid plaques but not with the amyloid. In PiD, strongly positive 
      huntingtin immunostaining was present within cytoplasmic Pick bodies. Our 
      findings suggest huntingtin selectively accumulates in association with abnormal 
      intracytoplasmic and cytoskeletal filaments of neurons and glia in 
      neurodegenerative diseases such as HD, AD, and PiD. Cells in the CNS appear 
      sensitive to damage by the aggregated, toxic levels of huntingtin and evidence of 
      its interaction with neurofilaments could provide information about its potential 
      role in the aetiology of HD.

TI  - Functional analysis of the Huntington's disease (HD) gene promoter.
PG  - 791-800
AB  - The basis for the highly specific neuronal vulnerability seen in Huntington's 
      disease (HD) has not been determined. Recent studies have demonstrated that 
      variation in HD protein expression occurs in the striatum, with affected regions 
      showing increased HD immunoreactivity. Experiments in HD and SCA1 transgenic mice 
      suggest a correlation between phenotypic severity and expression of the mutant 
      transgene. To gain insights into control of HD gene expression, and to 
      investigate the possibility of cell-cell differences in transcription, we have 
      analysed the 5' upstream region of the HD gene in a neuronal (SK-N-SH) and a 
      non-neuronal (JEG3) cell line. Reporter gene assays demonstrated the presence of 
      a key positive-acting region apparently arising from two Sp1 sites in a tandem 
      repeat acting synergistically. This site is polymorphic, and a single Sp1 site is 
      associated with reduced levels of transcription. These experiments also reveal 
      differences in control of expression between neuronal and non-neuronal cell 
      lines.

AB  - Interactions with antidepressants, as well as other biochemical evidence, 
      implicate the serotonin transporter 5-HTT in the etiology of affective disorders. 
      However, genetic studies have produced conflicting results concerning an 
      association of 5-HTT with bipolar disorder. We examined a variable number tandem 
      repeat in the regulatory region of this gene to investigate the possible 
      contribution of 5-HTT to bipolar disorder susceptibility in a 22-pedigree series. 
      By affected-sib-pair analysis and the transmission/disequilibrium test, we found 
      no significant linkage or association of 5-HTT to bipolar disorder. During the 
      course of this study, we adapted a PCR technique designed to amplify long 
      templates to replicating long GC stretches with complex structure. We also 
      refined the location of 5-HTT by radiation hybrid mapping, placing the locus 
      between D17S1294 and SHGC11022 on 17q11.2.

TI  - Serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene polymorphisms are not associated with 
      susceptibility to mood disorders.
PG  - 1-3
AB  - In a population-based association study, we tested the hypothesis that allelic 
      variants of the human serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene confer susceptibility to 
      mood disorders. Both a biallelic repeat polymorphism in the 5' promotor region 
      that differentially modulates gene expression and a second intron 
      variable-number-tandem-repeat (VNTR) marker were genotyped in 294 controls and 
      115 patients with mood disorders. Subjects were of West European descent and 
      included 36 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 79 patients with 
      bipolar I disorder (BD). No significant differences in genotype or allele 
      frequencies were found at either locus between controls and combined patients, 
      nor between controls and MDD or BD patients separately. Thus, our data do not 
      support the association between depressive disorder and a nine-repeat allelic 
      variant of the 5-HTT VNTR marker recently reported by Ogilvie et al. (Lancet 
      347:731-733, 1996). More importantly, no association between alleles conveying 
      functional differences in 5-HTT gene expression and MDD or BD could be found. 
      Taken together, our data suggest that the 5-HTT gene is not commonly involved in 
      the susceptibility to mood disorders.

TI  - Are neuronal intranuclear inclusions the common neuropathology of triplet-repeat 
      disorders with polyglutamine-repeat expansions?
PG  - 131-3
AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusions have been found in the brain of a transgenic 
      mouse model of Huntington's disease and in necropsy brain tissue of patients with 
      Huntington's disease. We suggest that neuronal intranuclear inclusions are the 
      common neuropathology for all inherited diseases caused by expansion of 
      polyglutamine repeats. We also suggest that patients with a pathological 
      diagnosis of neuronal intranuclear hyaline inclusion disease may also have 
      polyglutamine repeat expansions.

TI  - Fragile X premutations are not a major cause of early menopause.
PG  - 1362-9
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked mental retardation condition that usually is 
      due to a trinucleotide-repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene. Whereas full-mutation 
      alleles (> 230 repeats) lead to fragile X syndrome, premutation alleles 
      (approximately 60-200 repeats) are apparently non-penetrant. However, previous 
      studies have suggested that female premutation carriers may have an increased 
      incidence of premature menopause. To test this possible association, we screened 
      for premutation alleles among 216 women with early menopause (at age < 47 years), 
      33 of whom had premature menopause (at age < 40 years), as well as among 107 
      control women, all of whom were ascertained solely on the basis of age at 
      menopause. No full-mutation alleles were found; and only one premutation allele 
      was found, but, it was in a member of the control group. These results are 
      consistent with what would be expected on the basis of chance only. Our sample 
      size was sufficient to rule out a > or = 3-fold increased risk of early menopause 
      and a > or = 9-fold increased risk of premature menopause due to an FMR1 
      premutation, under a model considering the risk of both sporadic and familial 
      early menopause. Likewise, our results rule out a > or = 4-fold increased risk of 
      familial early menopause and a > or = 26-fold increased risk of familial 
      premature menopause, under a less probable model in which only familial early 
      menopause is considered. These results indicate that the fragile X premutation is 
      not a major risk factor for early menopause and suggest that the risk of 
      premature menopause to fragile X-premutation carriers may not be as great as that 
      reported elsewhere.

TI  - Serotonin transporter gene polymorphisms: ethnic difference and possible 
      association with bipolar affective disorder.
PG  - 457-62
AB  - There is some evidence suggesting that a polymorphism of variable number of 
      tandem repeats (VNTR) in the second intron of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) 
      gene and another variation which lies 1.2 kb upstream of the promoter of the gene 
      (5-HTTLPR) are associated with affective disorders. However, conflicting results 
      have also been reported. We examined an allelic association of these two 
      polymorphisms in a Japanese sample of 191 patients with affective disorders (142 
      bipolar and 49 unipolar) and 212 controls. Substantial differences in the number 
      and frequency of alleles between Caucasians and Japanese were observed for both 
      polymorphisms. A significant association between the VNTR polymorphism and 
      bipolar disorder (genotypic association: odds ratio 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.0; allelic 
      association: odds ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-3.0) was found, but not between the 
      5-HTTLPR polymorphism and bipolar disorder. No significant association with 
      unipolar depression was detected using either genetic marker, although this may 
      be attributable to the relatively small number of subjects with unipolar 
      depression. Our results suggest that the VNTR itself or another unknown 
      functional polymorphism which would be in linkage disequilibrium to the VNTR has 
      an effect on susceptibility to bipolar disorder.

TI  - Huntingtin is required for neurogenesis and is not impaired by the Huntington's 
      disease CAG expansion.
PG  - 404-10
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion that lengthens a glutamine segment in the novel 
      huntingtin protein. To elucidate the molecular basis of HD, we extended the 
      polyglutamine tract of the mouse homologue, Hdh, by targetted introduction of an 
      expanded human HD CAG repeat, creating mutant HdhneoQ50 and HdhQ50 alleles that 
      express reduced and wild-type levels of altered huntingtin, respectively. Mice 
      homozygous for reduced levels displayed characteristic aberrant brain development 
      and perinatal lethality, indicating a critical function for Hdh in neurogenesis. 
      However, mice with normal levels of mutant huntingtin did not display these 
      abnormalities, indicating that the expanded CAG repeat does not eliminate or 
      detectably impair huntingtin's neurogenic function. Thus, the HD defect in man 
      does not mimic complete or partial Hdh inactivation and appears to cause 
      neurodegenerative disease by a gain-of-function mechanism.

AB  - We reviewed 44 symptomatic children tested for CAG repeat expansions in the gene 
      responsible for Huntington's disease (HD). Thirty-three patients had CAG repeat 
      expansions, and 11 did not. No patient with a CAG repeat expansion had a negative 
      family history of HD. Of the 15 patients presenting in the first decade, 12 had 
      greater than 80 CAG repeats and a clinical profile at the time of the test that 
      included two or more of the following: declining school performance, seizures, 
      oral motor dysfunction, rigidity, and gait disorder. Three patients with smaller 
      CAG repeat expansions had incomplete or atypical symptom profiles. Symptom 
      patterns in patients presenting in the second decade were more varied but usually 
      included behavioral and motor symptoms. Patients without CAG expansions had 
      incomplete or atypical symptom profiles. We define the historical and clinical 
      profiles of HD presenting in the first two decades and suggest that physicians 
      exercise restraint in using a "diagnostic" gene test for HD in the evaluation of 
      at-risk children with incomplete or atypical symptom profiles or no family 
      history of HD, in whom test results are very likely to be normal or unrelated to 
      the patient's symptoms.

TI  - Genetic heterogeneity in familial acute myelogenous leukemia: evidence for a 
      second locus at chromosome 16q21-23.2.
PG  - 873-81
AB  - The identification of genes responsible for the rare cases of familial leukemia 
      may afford insight into the mechanism underlying the more common sporadic 
      occurrences. Here we test a single family with 11 relevant meioses transmitting 
      autosomal dominant acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplasia for 
      linkage to three potential candidate loci. In a different family with inherited 
      AML, linkage to chromosome 21q22.1-22.2 was recently reported; we exclude linkage 
      to 21q22.1-22.2, demonstrating that familial AML is a heterogeneous disease. 
      After reviewing familial leukemia and observing anticipation in the form of a 
      declining age of onset with each generation, we had proposed 9p21-22 and 16q22 as 
      additional candidate loci. Whereas linkage to 9p21-22 can be excluded, the 
      finding of a maximum two-point LOD score of 2.82 with the microsatellite marker 
      D16S522 at a recombination fraction theta = 0 provides evidence supporting 
      linkage to 16q22. Haplotype analysis reveals a 23.5-cM (17.9-Mb) commonly 
      inherited region among all affected family members extending from D16S451 to 
      D16S289. In order to extract maximum linkage information with missing 
      individuals, incomplete informativeness with individual markers in this interval, 
      and possible deviance from strict autosomal dominant inheritance, we performed 
      nonparametric linkage analysis (NPL) and found a maximum NPL statistic 
      corresponding to a P-value of .00098, close to the maximum conditional 
      probability of linkage expected for a pedigree with this structure. Mutational 
      analysis in this region specifically excludes expansion of the AT-rich 
      minisatellite repeat FRA16B fragile site and the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the 
      E2F-4 transcription factor. The "repeat expansion detection" method, capable of 
      detecting dynamic mutation associated with anticipation, more generally excludes 
      large CAG repeat expansion as a cause of leukemia in this family.

TI  - Formation of neuronal intranuclear inclusions underlies the neurological 
      dysfunction in mice transgenic for the HD mutation.
PG  - 537-48
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is one of an increasing number of human 
      neurodegenerative disorders caused by a CAG/polyglutamine-repeat expansion. The 
      mutation occurs in a gene of unknown function that is expressed in a wide range 
      of tissues. The molecular mechanism responsible for the delayed onset, selective 
      pattern of neuropathology, and cell death observed in HD has not been described. 
      We have observed that mice transgenic for exon 1 of the human HD gene carrying 
      (CAG)115 to (CAG)156 repeat expansions develop pronounced neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusions, containing the proteins huntingtin and ubiquitin, prior to developing 
      a neurological phenotype. The appearance in transgenic mice of these inclusions, 
      followed by characteristic morphological change within neuronal nuclei, is 
      strikingly similar to nuclear abnormalities observed in biopsy material from HD 
      patients.

TI  - Analysis of the 5' upstream sequence of the Huntington's disease (HD) gene shows 
      six new rare alleles which are unrelated to the age at onset of HD.
PG  - 371-4
AB  - The CAG repeat number in the Huntington's disease (HD) gene accounts for about 
      50% of the variation seen in age at onset of HD. In order to determine whether 
      promoter sequence variation can contribute to the residual variation in age at 
      onset, we studied the conserved 303 bp region upstream of the +1 translation 
      start site in the HD gene in a population of 56 control East Anglians, 30 
      Africans, 34 Japanese, and 208 English Huntington's disease patients. A 
      surprisingly high degree of variation was found. Seven alleles were identified, 
      comprising four polymorphisms: two single base pair substitutions, a 6 bp VNTR 
      present as one or two copies, and a 20 bp VNTR with one to three copies of the 
      tandem repeat. No correlation between polymorphisms and age at onset of symptoms 
      was found in HD patients. The 6 bp and 20 bp stretches are present only in single 
      copies in the chimpanzees and gorilla, suggesting that these VNTRs have evolved 
      by duplication of the core sequences in the human lineage.

TI  - Identification of an HD patient with a (CAG)180 repeat expansion and the 
      propagation of highly expanded CAG repeats in lambda phage.
PG  - 692-5
AB  - The Huntington's disease mutation has been identified as a CAG/polyglutamine 
      repeat expansion in a large gene of unknown function. In order to develop the 
      transgenic systems necessary to uncover the molecular pathology of this disorder, 
      it is necessary to be able to manipulate highly expanded CAG repeats in a cloned 
      form. We have identified a patient with an expanded allele of greater than 170 
      repeat units and have cloned the mutant allele in the lambda zap vector. The 
      recovery of highly expanded repeats after clone propagation was more efficient 
      when repeats were maintained as lambda phage clones rather than as the plasmid 
      counterparts. Manipulation of the repeats as phage clones has enabled us to 
      generate Huntington's disease transgenic mice that contain highly expanded 
      (CAG)115-(CAG)150 repeats and that develop a progressive neurological phenotype.

TI  - Genotypes at the GluR6 kainate receptor locus are associated with variation in 
      the age of onset of Huntington disease.
PG  - 3872-6
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is associated with abnormal expansions of a CAG repeat 
      close to the 5' end of the IT15 gene. We have assembled a set of 293 HD subjects 
      whose ages of onset were known and sized their HD CAG repeats. These repeats 
      accounted for 69% of the variance of age of onset when we used the most 
      parsimonious model, which relates the logarithm of age of onset to a function of 
      CAG repeat number. Since other familial factors have been proposed to influence 
      the age of onset of HD, we have examined a number of candidate loci. The CAG 
      repeat number on normal chromosomes, the delta2642 polymorphism in the HD gene, 
      and apolipoprotein E genotypes did not affect the age of onset of HD. Although 
      mitochondrial energy production defects in HD have led to suggestions that 
      variants in the mitochondrial genome may be associated with clinical variability 
      in HD, this suggestion was not supported by our preliminary experiments that 
      examined the DdeI mitochondrial restriction fragment length polymorphism at 
      position 10,394. Excitotoxicity has been a favored mechanism to explain the cell 
      death in HD, particularly since intrastriatal injection of excitatory amino acids 
      in animals creates HD-like pathology. Accordingly, we investigated the GluR6 
      kainate receptor. Of the variance in the age of onset of HD that was not 
      accounted for by the CAG repeats, 13% could be attributed to GluR6 genotype 
      variation. These data implicate GluR6-mediated excitotoxicity in the pathogenesis 
      of HD and highlight the potential importance of this process in other 
      polyglutamine repeat expansion diseases.

TI  - Different mechanisms underlie DNA instability in Huntington disease and 
      colorectal cancer.
PG  - 879-90
AB  - Two recent lines of evidence raise the possibility that instability in germ-line 
      or somatic cells arises by a common mechanism that involves defective mismatch 
      repair. Mutations in mismatch-repair proteins are known to cause instability in 
      hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, instability that is physically similar 
      to germ-line instability observed in Huntington disease (HD). Furthermore, both 
      germ-line and somatic-cell instability are likely to be mitotic defects, the 
      former occurring early in embryogenesis. To test the hypothesis that defective 
      repair is a common prerequisite for instability, we have utilized two disease 
      groups that represent different instability "conditions." Germ-line instability 
      within simple tandem repeats (STR) at 10 loci in 29 HD families were compared 
      with somatic instability at the same loci in 26 colon cancer (CC) patients with 
      identified or suspected defects in mismatch-repair enzymes. HD is known to be 
      caused by expansion within the CAG repeat of the locus, but the extent or pattern 
      of STR instability outside this region has not been examined systematically. We 
      find a distinctly different pattern of STR mutation in the two disease groups, 
      suggesting different mechanisms. Instability in HD is generally confined to a 
      single locus, whereas instability is widespread for the same loci in CC. Our data 
      do not support a causative role for defective mismatch-repair enzymes in 
      instability associated with HD; rather, our data are consistent with a model in 
      which DNA structure may inhibit normal mismatch repair at the expansion site.

TI  - Clinical presentation and patterns of regional cerebral atrophy related to the 
      length of trinucleotide repeat expansion in patients with adult onset 
      Huntington's disease.
PG  - 45-8
AB  - We correlated trinucleotide CAG repeat numbers in the huntingtin gene with the 
      regional brain atrophy and clinical phenotype in 23 adult autopsy cases of 
      Huntington's disease (HD). CAG repeat number (39-56, mean 45.4 +/- 4.6) 
      correlated inversely (P < 0.0001) with age at onset and death, but not with 
      disease duration or initial symptoms. Cross-sectional areas of the striatum, 
      pallidum, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, and the cortical grey and white matter 
      within the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes at four levels (genu of the 
      corpus callosum, amygdala, accumbens, hippocampus) were measured morphometrically 
      from the coronal brain slices using image analysis. None of these morphometric 
      variables correlated with number of CAG repeats. Thus, tissue atrophy in advanced 
      HD is unrelated to the underlying genetic defect.

TI  - Modified Method for the Detection of the CAG Repeat Expansion in Huntington's 
      Disease and Application to a Predictive Testing Protocol.
PG  - 53-59
AB  - Background: The identification of the CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion as the 
      cause of Huntington's disease (HD) has dramatically altered the ease and uptake 
      of testing. The direct test for the mutation allows testing of many more 
      consultands, particularly those individuals whose family structure is not 
      suitable for linkage analysis. Therefore, protocols that can rapidly handle a 
      number of samples and give accurate reliable results are essential. Methods and 
      Results: The HD1/HD2 set of primers, which amplify the variable CAG and 
      polymorphic CCG repeats, and the HD1/HD3 set of primers, which amplify only the 
      variable CAG repeat, were used. Comparison of internally labeled with end-labeled 
      polymerase chain reaction product was made. "Lysates" made from blood were 
      investigated as suitable material for the HD polymerase chain reaction. 
      Conclusions: The conditions used for detection of the CAG repeat in the 
      huntingtin gene by end labeling of one of the primers that amplifies only the CAG 
      repeat were improved, and an efficient protocol that reduces sample preparation 
      and storage by using lysates from blood rather than extracted purified genomic 
      DNA was developed.

TI  - The insulin gene is transcribed in the human thymus and transcription levels 
      correlated with allelic variation at the INS VNTR-IDDM2 susceptibility locus for 
      type 1 diabetes.
PG  - 293-7
AB  - Type 1, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is an autoimmune disease 
      associated with loss of tolerance to several pancreatic islet cell molecules, 
      including insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), ICA69 and the tyrosine 
      phosphatase IA-2 (refs 1-3). Among several predisposing loci, IDDM2 maps to the 
      insulin gene (INS) VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) minisatellite on 
      chromosome 11p15 (refs 4-9). Allelic variation at this VNTR locus correlates with 
      steady-state levels of INS mRNA in pancreas and transfected rodent cell lines, 
      but it is difficult to reconcile the association of lower INS mRNA levels in the 
      pancreas with class III VNTRs that are dominantly protective from IDDM. We show 
      that during fetal development and childhood, mRNAs for insulin and other islet 
      cell autoantigens (GAD, ICA69, IA-2) are expressed at low levels in the human 
      thymus. Critically, we also detect proinsulin and insulin protein. VNTR alleles 
      correlate with differential INS mRNA expression in the thymus where, in contrast 
      to the pancreas, protective class III VNTRs are associated with higher 
      steady-state levels of INS mRNA expression. This finding provides a plausible 
      explanation for the dominant protective effect of class III VNTRs, and suggests 
      that diabetes susceptibility and resistance associated with IDDM2 may derive from 
      the VNTR influence on INS transcription in the thymus. Higher levels of 
      (pro)insulin in the thymus may promote negative selection (deletion) of 
      insulin-specific T-lymphocytes which play a critical role in the pathogenesis of 
      type-1 diabetes.

TI  - Physical mapping and genomic structure of the Lowe syndrome gene OCRL1.
PG  - 145-50
AB  - The oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe (OCRL; McKusick 309,000) is a rare 
      X-linked disorder characterized by mental retardation, congenital cataracts, and 
      Fanconi syndrome of the proximal renal tubules. We have carried out physical 
      mapping of the OCRL1 gene and determined that it contains 24 exons occupying 58 
      kb. The gene, located in Xq25-26, is transcribed in a centromeric to telomeric 
      direction. Primers have been developed that allow all coding exons and their 
      intron/exon boundaries to be amplified from genomic DNA for mutation detection. 
      Two tetranucleotide tandem repeat polymorphisms were characterized that 
      immediately flank the OCRL1 gene and, together, are informative in over 90% of 
      females. Variable splicing was seen in the OCRL1 transcript, involving a small 
      24-bp exon. These results should prove useful to medical and molecular 
      geneticists studying mutations and providing DNA diagnostic services to families 
      dealing with Lowe syndrome as well as to cell biologists interested in 
      structure-function relationships for the OCRL1 protein.

TI  - The repeat expansion detection method in the analysis of diseases with CAG/CTG 
      repeat expansion: usefulness and limitations.
PG  - 486-8
AB  - The repeat expansion detection (RED) method was described to detect expansions of 
      trinucleotide repeats of unknown chromosomal location. We have improved the RED 
      method by the use of 8-mer oligonucleotides and assessed its usefulness in 30 
      samples from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), Huntington's 
      disease (HD), and Machado Joseph's disease (MJD), for which the number of CAG/CTG 
      repeats was determined by sequencing. There was a good correlation between the 
      number of repeats detected by sequencing and those identified by RED. However, in 
      17% of samples, the RED gave additional fragments for ligation products of 
      different size than the CAG/CTG repeat expansion detected in the sample by 
      sequencing. The same was observed in a group of control subjects (n = 78) without 
      known clinical abnormalities in which products of more than 40 repeats were 
      detected in 27% of them, indicating that CAG/CTG repeat expansions are common in 
      the general population. Wether this corresponds to unidentified loci with 
      expansions deserves further investigation.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeats in the human genome: size distributions for all possible 
      triplets and detection of expanded disease alleles in a group of Huntington 
      disease individuals by the repeat expansion detection method.
PG  - 77-83
AB  - Using a modified Repeat Expansion Detection (RED) assay, that was optimized for 
      individual oligonucleotides, unrelated individuals were systematically screened 
      for maximal repeat sizes of each of the ten possible trinucleotide repeats. 
      Cloned trinucleotide repeats were generated and used as standards for the 
      detectability of single copy trinucleotide repeat fragments. When the size 
      distributions of trinucleotide repeats were compared to previously reported data, 
      significant differences were found for the CTT repeat, which corresponds to the 
      expanded GAA repeat in Friedreich ataxia, as well as for ATT, CCT and GTT 
      repeats. Since 30-35% of normal individuals have CTG/CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      sizes of 180 bp or more, we investigated the question whether small-scale CTG/CAG 
      repeat expansions are detectable on a population basis by using the RED 
      technique. We blindly screened 20 HD probands with CAG expansions of the HD gene, 
      ranging in size between 120 and 174 bp, and found that a shift to larger CAG size 
      ranges is clearly detectable when comparing the distribution of maximal repeat 
      sizes in the disease group to a control group. Our study, therefore, demonstrates 
      that the application of the RED assay to a population of probands and a 
      population of controls allows the detection of small-scale CTG/CAG repeat 
      expansions in the size range of the expanded HD gene and present in a single 
      allele. We also provide standards and control data for the detection of other 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions.

TI  - Polymorphism within the second intron of the IL-1 receptor antagonist gene in 
      patients with hematopoietic malignancies.
PG  - 239-42
AB  - Alleles of the IL-1 genes are associated with several autoimmune and inflammatory 
      diseases, where they tend to have a role in the severity of the disease rather 
      than in susceptibility to the disease itself. Allele 2 of the variable number 
      tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) gene 
      was the first marker of the IL-1 cluster to be associated in this way with 
      severity of chronic, systemic and local inflammatory diseases. Because of the 
      role that IL-1 also plays in the pathobiology of certain hematopoietic disorders, 
      we aimed at examining the allelic distribution of the IL-1ra VNTR in leukemias, 
      lymphomas and related malignancies. While in patients with chronic lymphocytic 
      leukemia (CLL), hairy cell leukemia (HCL), multiple myeloma (MM) and related 
      disorders, primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 
      and Hodgkin's disease (HD), the allelic distribution of IL-1RN was comparable to 
      that seen in healthy control subjects, in a small group of patients with 
      secondary AML the frequency of the IL-1RN*4 allele appeared to be significantly 
      increased.

TI  - Transglutaminase activity is related to CAG repeat length in patients with 
      Huntington's disease.
PG  - 633-5
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with CAG 
      repeat expansion. We measured transglutaminase (TGase) activity in lymphocytes 
      from 35 HD patients and from healthy individuals to ascertain whether it was 
      altered in this condition. TGase activity was above maximum control levels in 25% 
      of HD patients; it was correlated with the age of the patient and inversely 
      correlated with the CAG repeat length. These results suggest that: (1) HD could 
      be biochemically heterogeneous, and (2) the length of the CAG repeat 
      expansion/TGase ratio could be important in the manifestation of HD.

TI  - Nuclease sensitivity of permeabilized cells confirms altered chromatin formation 
      at the fragile X locus.
PG  - 435-41
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is caused by the expansion and concomitant methylation of a 
      CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene which results in the 
      transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene, delayed replication of the FMR1 
      locus, and the formation of a folate sensitive fragile site (FRAXA) at Xq27.3. 
      The mechanism by which repeat expansion and methylation causes these changes is 
      unknown. An in vivo system in which cells were permeabilized with 
      lysophosphatidylcholine followed by digestion with MspI endonuclease was utilized 
      to assess the chromatin conformation at the fragile X locus. The FMR1 gene was 
      inaccessible to MspI digestion in fragile X patients, but not in normal or 
      carrier individuals, confirming that altered chromatin conformation results from 
      the repeat expansion and methylation seen in fragile X syndrome.

TI  - Exon 1 of the HD gene with an expanded CAG repeat is sufficient to cause a 
      progressive neurological phenotype in transgenic mice.
PG  - 493-506
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is one of an increasing number of neurodegenerative 
      disorders caused by a CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion. Mice have been 
      generated that are transgenic for the 5' end of the human HD gene carrying 
      (CAG)115-(CAG)150 repeat expansions. In three lines, the transgene is 
      ubiquitously expressed at both mRNA and protein level. Transgenic mice exhibit a 
      progressive neurological phenotype that exhibits many of the features of HD, 
      including choreiform-like movements, involuntary stereotypic movements, tremor, 
      and epileptic seizures, as well as nonmovement disorder components. This 
      transgenic model will greatly assist in an eventual understanding of the 
      molecular pathology of HD and may open the way to the testing of intervention 
      strategies.

TI  - Genetic fitness in Huntington's Disease and Spinocerebellar Ataxia 1: a 
      population genetics model for CAG repeat expansions.
PG  - 423-35
AB  - An analysis of genetic fitness was performed in Huntington's Disease (HD) and 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia 1 (SCA1) families. Two partially overlapping samples were 
      used: clinically defined HD and SCA1 patients from families ascertained in 
      definite geographical areas, and molecularly typed carriers of HD and SCA1 
      mutations (CAG trinucleotide expansions). In both cases, a control group of 
      normal relatives was used. HD and SCA1 patients born before 1915-20 had more 
      children than normal controls. Carriers of HD and SCA1 mutations, all in the 
      low/medium expansion range (37-49 and 47-54 CAG repeats respectively), had a 
      higher number of children than controls up to more recent times (1935-1950). The 
      reproduction of heterozygotes for large expansions could be analysed only in 
      subjects born after 1950 and provided indirect evidence of a lower than normal 
      number of children. The above results fit a model based on a differential fitness 
      according to the degree of expansion. Such a model predicts that 1) up to 
      relatively recently the frequency of alleles in the low/medium range has been 
      maintained or even increased by the increased fitness of their carriers, as well 
      as by new mutations, and 2) the frequency of large expansions, part of which are 
      lost at each generation, is maintained through further expansions of alleles in 
      the low/medium expansion range. The implications of such a model on linkage 
      disequilibrium and the possible spread of these diseases in future generations 
      are discussed.

TI  - Identification of FMR2, a novel gene associated with the FRAXE CCG repeat and CpG 
      island.
PG  - 109-13
AB  - Five folate-sensitive fragile sites have been identified at the molecular level 
      to date. Each is characterized by an expanded and methylated trinucleotide repeat 
      CGG (CCG). Of the three X chromosome sites, FRAXA, FRAXE and FRAXF, the former 
      two are associated with mental retardation in their expanded forms. FRAXA 
      expansion results in fragile X syndrome due to down regulation of expression of 
      the FMR1 gene, which carries the hypermutable CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated 
      portion of its first exon. Mild mental retardation without consistent physical 
      findings has been found associated with expanded CCG repeats at FRAXE. We have 
      identified a large gene (FMR2) transcribed distally from the CpG island at FRAXE, 
      and down-regulated by repeat expansion and methylation. The gene is novel, 
      expressed in adult brain and placenta, and shows similarity with another human 
      protein, MLLT2, expressed from a gene at chromosome 4q21 involved in 
      translocations found in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells. Identification 
      of this gene will facilitate further studies to determine the role of its product 
      in FRAXE associated mental deficiency.

TI  - Psychiatric symptoms and CAG expansion in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 53-7
AB  - The mutation responsible for Huntington's disease (HD) is an elongated CAG repeat 
      in the coding region of the IT15 gene. A PCR-based test with high sensitivity and 
      accuracy is now available to identify asymptomatic gene carriers and patients. An 
      inverse correlation between CAG copy number and age at disease onset has been 
      found in a large number of affected individuals. The influence of the CAG repeat 
      expansion on other phenotypic manifestations, especially specific psychiatric 
      symptoms has not been studied intensively. In order to elucidate this situation 
      we investigated the relation between CAG copy number and distinct psychiatric 
      phenotypes found in 79 HD-patients. None of the four differentiated categories 
      (personality change, psychosis, depression, and nonspecific alterations) showed 
      significant differences in respect to size of the CAG expansion. In addition, no 
      influence of individual sex on psychiatric presentation could be found. On the 
      other hand in patients with personality changes maternal transmission was 
      significantly more frequent compared with all other groups. Therefore we suggest 
      that clinical severity of psychiatric features in HD is not directly dependent on 
      the size of the dynamic mutation involved. The complex pathogenetic mechanisms 
      leading to psychiatric alterations are still unknown and thus genotyping does not 
      provide information about expected psychiatric symptoms in HD gene carriers.

TI  - A reproducible assay of polymerase chain reaction to detect trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion of Huntington's disease and senile chorea.
PG  - 16-8
AB  - A simple and reproducible method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was 
      established to detect trinucleotide repeat expansion for Huntington's disease 
      (HD) using a new DNA polymerase and buffer system. The system consists of an 
      extremely heat stable DNA polymerase (Pfu), and a buffer supplemented with 
      ammonium sulfate and dimethyl sulfoxide. Previous methods to amplify expanded 
      alleles for HD have been very complex in PCR conditions, but the reproducibility 
      was sometimes very low because of repetitive sequences around the primer 
      sequences. With the present method, strong bands for the disease alleles were 
      reproducibly visible in a conventional agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide 
      without using isotopes. Three cases with sporadic HD and a case with senile 
      chorea showed expanded alleles for HD with smaller sizes of the expansion than 
      cases with typical HD. These results showed that the present method provides a 
      simple and reproducible way to detect HD allele, and some cases with sporadic HD 
      and senile chorea had expanded HD alleles.

      relative risk of HD with the deletion being at a value of 8.26. In this study, 
      the presence of the deleted allele on HD chromosomes increases the (CAG)n number 
      (47.93 +/- 1.80 versus 43.50 +/- 2.78) and decreases the age of onset (41.34 +/- 
      2.09 versus 36.90 +/- 2.41) in the patients with versus without delta 2642; so 
      the deletion may add to the severity of the disease. Our studies of delta 2642 on 
      N chromosomes confirm that the deletion event occurs on N chromosomes with a 
      (CAG)n allele length at the upper end of the normal size range.

TI  - Sequence analysis of the CAG triplet repeats region in the Huntington disease 
      gene (IT15) in several mammalian species.
PG  - 81-6
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease linked to 
      abnormally expanded CAG repeats in the first exon of the IT15 gene. Neither HD or 
      other glutamine expansion triplet disease has not yet been described in other 
      species as human. In this study, we sequenced the region containing the CAG 
      repeat expansion region of the corresponding IT15 gene in several mammalian 
      species. In all investigated species, the number of CAG found is equal or 
      inferior to the normal range of human IT15 alleles. The longer uninterrupted CAG 
      stretch was found in the pig and consists of 18 CAG. In the other species, the 
      CAG stretch was shorter and/or interrupted by other triplets. The proline 
      encoding region following the CAG stretch is conserved in the mammalian species 
      studied here and the number of proline is few or not reduced compared to the 
      number of the glutamine codon repeats region.

TI  - Molecular re-investigation of patients with Huntington's disease in Wessex 
      reveals a family with dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy.
PG  - 76-8
AB  - Dentatorubral and pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA), a neurological disorder thought 
      to be rare in European populations, is caused by a triplet repeat expansion in 
      the B37 gene on chromosome 12. This disorder can phenotypically mimic 
      Huntington's disease (HD) which is also caused by a repeat expansion. We have 
      analysed 139 affected individuals for the HD triplet repeat expansion and found 
      132 patients had one normal and one expanded allele. Two patients had an 
      expansion on both chromosomes and five patients had two normal-size alleles. Of 
      these five patients, two were considered to be atypical Two patients who were 
      father and daughter were found to have an expansion of the DRPLA triplet repeat. 
      This therefore constitutes the second such family described in the United 
      Kingdom.

TI  - CAG expansion affects the expression of mutant Huntingtin in the Huntington's 
      disease brain.
PG  - 1193-201
AB  - A trinucleotide repeat (CAG) expansion in the huntingtin gene causes Huntington's 
      disease (HD). In brain tissue from HD heterozygotes with adult onset and more 
      clinically severe juvenile onset, where the largest expansions occur, a mutant 
      protein of equivalent intensity to wild-type huntingtin was detected in cortical 
      synaptosomes, indicating that a mutant species is synthesized and transported 
      with the normal protein to nerve endings. The increased size of mutant huntingtin 
      relative to the wild type was highly correlated with CAG repeat expansion, 
      thereby linking an altered electrophoretic mobility of the mutant protein to its 
      abnormal function. Mutant huntingtin appeared in gray and white matter with no 
      difference in expression in affected regions. The mutant protein was broader than 
      the wild type and in 6 of 11 juvenile cases resolved as a complex of bands, 
      consistent with evidence at the DNA level for somatic mosaicism. Thus, HD 
      pathogenesis results from a gain of function by an aberrant protein that is 
      widely expressed in brain and is harmful only to some neurons.

TI  - Molecular analysis of 24 Alagille syndrome families identifies a single 
      submicroscopic deletion and further localizes the Alagille region within 20p12.
PG  - 1068-73
AB  - Alagille syndrome (AGS) is a clinically defined disorder characterized by 
      cholestatic liver disease with bile duct paucity, peculiar facies, structural 
      heart defects, vertebral anomalies, and ocular abnormalities. Multiple patients 
      with various cytogenetic abnormalities involving 20p12 have been identified, 
      allowing the assignment of AGS to this region. The presence of interstitial 
      deletions of varying size led to the hypothesis that AGS is a contiguous gene 
      deletion syndrome. This molecular analysis of cytogenetically normal AGS patients 
      was performed in order to test this hypothesis and to refine the localization of 
      the known AGS region. Investigation of inheritance of simple tandem repeat 
      polymorphism alleles in 67 members of 24 cytogenetically normal Alagille families 
      led to the identification of a single submicroscopic deletion. The deletion 
      included loci D20S61, D20S41, D20S186, and D20S188 and presumably intervening 
      uninformative loci D20S189 and D20S27. The six deleted loci are contained in a 
      single YAC of 1.9 Mb. The additional finding of multiple unrelated probands who 
      are heterozygous at each locus demonstrates that microdeletions at known loci 
      within the AGS region are rare in cytogenetically normal patients with this 
      disorder. This suggests that the majority of cases of AGS may be the result of a 
      single gene defect rather than a contiguous gene deletion syndrome.

TI  - Identification and localization of huntingtin in brain and human lymphoblastoid 
      cell lines with anti-fusion protein antibodies.
PG  - 8710-4
AB  - The Huntington disease (HD) phenotype is associated with expansion of a 
      trinucleotide repeat in the IT15 gene, which is predicted to encode a 348-kDa 
      protein named huntington. We used polyclonal and monoclonal anti-fusion protein 
      antibodies to identify native huntingtin in rat, monkey, and human. Western blots 
      revealed a protein with the expected molecular weight which is present in the 
      soluble fraction of rat and monkey brain tissues and lymphoblastoid cells from 
      control cases. In lymphoblastoid cell lines from juvenile-onset heterozygote HD 
      cases, both normal and mutant huntingtin are expressed, and increasing repeat 
      expansion leads to lower levels of the mutant protein. Immunocytochemistry 
      indicates that huntingtin is located in neurons throughout the brain, with the 
      highest levels evident in larger neurons. In the human striatum, huntingtin is 
      enriched in a patch-like distribution, potentially corresponding to the first 
      areas affected in HD. Subcellular localization of huntingtin is consistent with a 
      cytosolic protein primarily found in somatodendritic regions. Huntingtin appears 
      to particularly associate with microtubules, although some is also associated 
      with synaptic vesicles. On the basis of the localization of huntingtin in 
      association with microtubules, we speculate that the mutation impairs the 
      cytoskeletal anchoring or transport of mitochondria, vesicles, or other 
      organelles or molecules.

TI  - Analysis of triplet repeats in the huntingtin gene in Japanese families affected 
      with Huntington's disease.
PG  - 701-5
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is associated with the expansion of a CAG repeat in the 
      huntingtin gene. Molecular analysis of the repeat in Japanese HD patients and 
      normal controls was performed. The size of the CAG repeat ranged from 37 to 95 
      repeats in affected subjects and from seven to 29 in normal controls. A 
      significant correlation was found between the age of onset and the CAG expansion. 
      The length of the expanded repeat is unstable in meiotic transmission and large 
      increases occur in paternal transmission. At the same time the CCG repeat 
      polymorphism adjacent to the CAG repeat was analysed and haplotypes of HD 
      chromosomes were identified. Strong linkage disequilibrium was found between the 
      CAG repeat expansion and an allele of (CCG)10 in Japanese HD chromosomes. It is 
      distinct from that described previously in western populations. Western HD 
      chromosomes strongly associate with an allele of (CCG)7. Possible mechanisms 
      underlying the disequilibrium in Japan are discussed.

TI  - Correlations between triplet repeat expansion and clinical features in 
      Huntington's disease.
PG  - 749-53
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate possible correlations between the length of the (CAG)n 
      trinucleotide repeat in Hungtington's disease gene IT15 and clinical features 
      (age at onset, symptoms at onset, and mode of progression) in Huntington's 
      disease. DESIGN: In 59 patients with Huntington's disease, the expansion of the 
      (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat was determined and clinical data were obtained 
      retrospectively. SETTING: The Center for Human Genetics, affiliated with a 
      university hospital. PATIENTS: All patients belonged to an initial group of 248 
      individuals tested in an indirect predictive testing procedure. RESULTS: A good 
      correlation was found between the expansion of the (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat 
      and the age at onset (r = -.71). No correlation was found between the repeat 
      length of the normal allele and the age at onset. No correlations were found 
      between repeat expansion and other clinical features, such as the nature of the 
      symptoms at onset (neurologic, psychiatric/cognitive, or both) and the mode of 
      progression. CONCLUSION: Factors that determine the nature of symptoms at onset 
      and the mode of progression of Huntington's disease seem to be operating 
      independently of the (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat in gene IT15.

TI  - Expansion of a (CAG)n repeat region in a sporadic case of HD.
PG  - 132-4
AB  - The genetic mutation underlying Huntington's disease (HD) has been identified as 
      an expansion and instability of a specific CAG repeat sequence in a gene on 
      chromosome 4. A simple polymerase chain reaction assay has been used for the 
      assessment of the (CAG)n expansion in a 72-year-old woman with typical HD 
      symptoms, but no family history of the disorder. The DNA analysis showed that the 
      patient had an allele with 41 repeat units, in the size range seen in HD 
      chromosomes. Therefore, HD diagnosis is confirmed in this seemingly sporadic case 
      and the disease is newly diagnosed in a large family. The risk of inheriting this 
      unstable expanded allele is discussed. INTRODUCTION--The discovery of an 
      expansion of a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat region in the IT15 gene on the short 
      arm of chromosome 4 has identified the mutational mechanism causing Huntington's 
      disease (HD) and enables the direct diagnosis of affected subjects based on DNA 
      analysis alone. Here a 72-year-old woman with typical HD symptoms, but no family 
      history of the disorder, has been unambiguously diagnosed by using a quick DNA 
      analysis. This is relevant because the disease is newly diagnosed in a large 
      family. MATERIAL AND METHODS--A labelled polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has 
      been used to amplify the repeat region of the IT15 gene and DNA fragments were 
      analyzed by Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RESULTS--The number the CAG 
      repeats in the proband displayed two alleles of 23 and 41 repeats, respectively. 
      Since normal chromosomes are reported to contain 11-34 repeats, the clinical 
      appearance of HD in the proband is explained by the presence of the repeat 
      expansion. DISCUSSION--The parents of the proposita both died aged over 80 y 
      apparently without neurological signs referable to HD. Hence, this is presumably 
      a sporadic case of the disease. Because of the length of 41 repeats of this HD 
      chromosome, offspring of this proband could inherit the expanded allele with 37 
      repeats, as expected for the reversal of the trinucleotide expansion. A subject 
      with this intermediate allele could be affected, but would not be affected if the 
      HD IT gene with reduced triplets had recovered its normal function. Thus, in a 
      seemingly sporadic case like the one reported here, despite the PCR analysis, the 
      risk of transmission of HD to her offspring may remain uncertain.

TI  - Targeted disruption of the Huntington's disease gene results in embryonic 
      lethality and behavioral and morphological changes in heterozygotes.
PG  - 811-23
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an incurable neuropsychiatric disease associated 
      with CAG repeat expansion within a widely expressed gene that causes selective 
      neuronal death. To understand its normal function, we have created a targeted 
      disruption in exon 5 of Hdh (Hdhex5), the murine homolog of the HD gene. 
      Homozygotes die before embryonic day 8.5, initiate gastrulation, but do not 
      proceed to the formation of somites or to organogenesis. Mice heterozygous for 
      the Hdhex5 mutation display increased motor activity and cognitive deficits. 
      Neuropathological assessment of two heterozygous mice shows significant neuronal 
      loss in the subthalamic nucleus. These studies show that the HD gene is essential 
      for postimplantation development and that it may play an important role in normal 
      functioning of the basal ganglia.

TI  - Molecular definition of the 22q11 deletions in velo-cardio-facial syndrome.
PG  - 1391-403
AB  - Velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS) is a common genetic disorder among individuals 
      with cleft palate and is associated with hemizygous deletions in human chromosome 
      22q11. Toward the molecular definition of the deletions, we constructed a 
      physical map of 22q11 in the form of overlapping YACs. The physical map covers > 
      9 cM of genetic distance, estimated to span 5 Mb of DNA, and contains a total of 
      64 markers. Eleven highly polymorphic short tandem-repeat polymorphic (STRP) 
      markers were placed on the physical map, and 10 of these were unambiguously 
      ordered. The 11 polymorphic markers were used to type the DNA from a total of 61 
      VCFS patients and 49 unaffected relatives. Comparison of levels of heterozygosity 
      of these markers in VCFS patients and their unaffected relatives revealed that 
      four of these markers are commonly hemizygous among VCFS patients. To confirm 
      these results and to define further the breakpoints in VCFS patients, 15 VCFS 
      individuals and their unaffected parents were genotyped for the 11 STRP markers. 
      Haplotypes generated from this study revealed that 82% of the patients have 
      deletions that can be defined by the STRP markers. The results revealed that all 
      patients who have a deletion share a common proximal breakpoint, while there are 
      two distinct distal breakpoints. Markers D22S941 and D22S944 appear to be 
      consistently hemizygous in patients with deletions. Both of these markers are 
      located on a single nonchimeric YAC that is 400 kb long. The results also show 
      that the parental origin of the deleted chromosome does not have any effect on 
      the phenotypic manifestation.

TI  - Translational suppression by trinucleotide repeat expansion at FMR1.
PG  - 731-4
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the result of the unstable expansion of a trinucleotide 
      repeat in the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. Fibroblast subclones from 
      a mildly affected patient, each containing stable FMR1 alleles with 57 to 285 CGG 
      repeats, were shown to exhibit normal steady-state levels of FMR1 messenger RNA. 
      However, FMR protein was markedly diminished from transcript with more than 200 
      repeats. Such transcripts were associated with stalled 40S ribosomal subunits. 
      These results suggest that a structural RNA transition beyond 200 repeats impedes 
      the linear 40S migration along the 5'-untranslated region. This results in 
      translational inhibition by trinucleotide repeat expansion.

TI  - Foci of trinucleotide repeat transcripts in nuclei of myotonic dystrophy cells 
      and tissues.
PG  - 995-1002
AB  - We have analyzed the intracellular localization of transcripts from the myotonin 
      protein kinase (Mt-PK) gene in fibroblasts and muscle biopsies from myotonic 
      dystrophy patients and normal controls. In affected individuals, a trinucleotide 
      expansion in the gene results in the phenotype, the severity of which is 
      proportional to the repeat length. A fluorochrome-conjugated probe (10 repeats of 
      CAG) hybridized specifically to this expanded repeat. Mt-PK transcripts 
      containing CTG repeat expansions were detected in the nucleus as bright foci in 
      DM patient fibroblasts and muscle biopsies, but not from normal individuals. 
      These foci represented transcripts from the Mt-PK gene since they simultaneously 
      hybridized to fluorochrome-conjugated probes to the 5'-end of the Mt-PK mRNA. A 
      single oligonucleotide probe to the repeat and the sense strand each conjugated 
      to different fluorochromes revealed the gene and the transcripts simultaneously, 
      and indicated that these focal concentrations (up to 13 per nucleus) represented 
      predominately posttranscriptional RNA since only a single focus contained both 
      the DNA and the RNA. This concentration of nuclear transcripts was diagnostic of 
      the affected state, and may represent aberrant processing of the RNA.

TI  - Correlation between magnitude of CAG repeat length alterations and length of the 
      paternal repeat in paternally inherited Huntington's disease.
PG  - 113-7
AB  - An increasing number of diseases are being found to be due to elongation of 
      specific trinucleotide repeat sequences. Inverse correlation between the age at 
      onset and the length of the repeat has been found in most of these. The elongated 
      CAG repeat causing Huntington's disease is highly unstable when inherited from an 
      affected father. In this study we found an average parent-to-offspring difference 
      of +0.08 repeat units in maternally inherited repeats, significantly less than 
      the average difference of +2.92 repeat units with paternal transmission. Large 
      repeat expansions, of more than 5 repeat units, were seen only in paternally 
      inherited cases. With paternal transmission the magnitude of repeat length 
      alterations was directly correlated to increasing paternal repeat length. 
      Increasing variation in repeat length among siblings was correlated to increasing 
      average repeat length in the sibship in both maternally and paternally inherited 
      HD. Comparison of the magnitude of repeat length alterations to parental age at 
      the time of birth of the offspring showed no correlation.

TI  - Huntington's disease CAG trinucleotide repeats in pathologically confirmed 
      post-mortem brains.
PG  - 159-66
AB  - CAG repeat expansion in the Huntington's disease gene (HD) was examined in 
      postmortem brains from 310 clinically diagnosed and 15 'at risk' individuals. 
      Presence of an expanded CAG allele (>37 units) was the cause of the disorder in 
      almost all cases (307 of 310). Despite a diversity of reporting clinicians, 
      neurological and psychiatric onset and age at death all displayed significant 
      inverse correlations with CAG number indicating that diagnosis of onset is 
      reasonably accurate, and that most patients die from the disease and its 
      complications. Neuronal changes before clinical onset are not detected by 
      conventional microscopic examination as three out of 15 'at risk' brains had an 
      expanded CAG allele but no neuropathology. The cause of HD-like neuropathology in 
      three exceptional brains from clinically diagnosed individuals is unclear. The 
      disorder in these cases could be an HD phenocopy or result from alternative 
      mutational mechanisms at the HD locus.

TI  - Normal CAG repeat length in the Huntington's disease gene in senile chorea.
PG  - 2183-4
AB  - There is a widely held belief that most patients presenting with senile chorea 
      have late-onset Huntington's disease (HD) with an unknown family history. We 
      measured CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HD gene in four patients with 
      a clinical presentation of senile chorea and found that CAG repetition lengths 
      were normal. These findings support senile chorea as being a distinct clinical 
      entity that is nosologically separate from late-onset HD.

TI  - Trinucleotide (CAG) repeat expansion in chromosomes of Spanish patients with 
      Huntington's disease.
PG  - 563-4
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative and hereditary disease 
      characterized by progressive movement disorders and mental and behavioral 
      abnormalities. The HD gene is an expanding and unstable trinucleotide repeat (CAG 
      repeat sequences). We studied 77 individuals from 38 families with HD in an 
      attempt to obtain information for genetic counselling and differential diagnosis. 
      Our results indicate that individuals with more than 40 repeats will be affected 
      by the disease, whereas those with fewer than 30 will be healthy. There can be 
      some overlap between 30 and 40 repeats, and one should be careful when 
      interpreting these results.

TI  - Mutation analysis in patients with possible but apparently sporadic Huntington's 
      disease.
PG  - 714-7
AB  - Until the advent of mutation analysis it was impossible to make a certain 
      diagnosis of Huntington's disease (HD) in the absence of a positive family 
      history, and sporadic cases of possible HD presented a substantial diagnostic 
      dilemma. We have looked for the characteristic expanded trinucleotide (CAG) 
      repeat sequence in the HD gene in 44 patients with probable or possible HD who 
      did not have similarly affected relatives. We used two methods, the traditional 
      widely used method, which estimates both the CAG repeat and the flanking CCG 
      repeat and gives the CAG length by subtraction, and the more precise CAG method, 
      which estimates the repeat length directly. With the CAG method, the HD mutation 
      was detected in 25 (89%) of 28 patients with the typical clinical features of HD 
      and 5 (31%) of 16 in whom the diagnosis was more doubtful. The CAG-CCG method 
      gave results in the borderline abnormal range of repeats for 13 of the 33 
      patients eventually shown to have an unequivocal repeat expansion by the CAG 
      method. Most of these patients had late onset of symptoms. There was evidence of 
      expansion of an intermediate-length paternal allele in 1 patient and of 
      non-paternity in another. The identification of the mutation causing HD means 
      that it is now possible to confirm or exclude the diagnosis with confidence, even 
      in the absence of a family history, by analysis of DNA from a blood sample. The 
      precise method of measuring the CAG repeat, which is technically more difficult 
      than the traditional method, may be needed to clarify results in a substantial 
      proportion of such patients.

TI  - CAG repeat size and clinical presentation in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 1137-43
AB  - The specific mutation in Huntington's disease (HD) is an expansion of the 
      unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat in the IT15 gene in chromosome 4p. We examined 
      the relationship between the CAG repeat size and clinical presentation in 36 
      patients with suspected diagnosis of HD. Twelve patients had no relatives with 
      documented HD, and five of them failed to show the expanded (>37) CAG repeats. 
      The remaining 31 patients, including seven patients with atypical clinical 
      features for HD (three without and four with family history of documented HD), 
      were heterozygotes for the CAG repeat expansion. There were large CAG repeats (50 
      copies) in paternally transmitted HD cases with early onset (age 30 or earlier). 
      The rate of disease progression was faster in paternally transmitted cases 
      regardless of the CAG repeat length or age of onset. We conclude that (1) 
      patients lacking the family history of HD frequently show no expansion of the CAG 
      repeats, and (2) the sex of the affected parent influences both the CAG repeat 
      size and the phenotypic expression of the HD gene in the offspring.

TI  - Analysis of the trinucleotide repeat expansion in Italian families affected with 
      Huntington disease.
PG  - 93-8
AB  - 150 subjects affected with HD and 45 at high risk for the disease were typed for 
      the CAG trinucleotide repeat at the 5' end of IT15. In all of them we find 
      expanded segments showing marked instability upon transmission. Their length 
      distribution matches those previously reported and inversely correlates (-0.686) 
      with age at onset. Two at risk sibs from a large HD pedigree show expanded 
      segments that overlap the normal distribution and can represent reductions from 
      the HD to the normal range. A case of instability on a normal chromosome is also 
      reported. Finally, an analysis of the CAG repeat as a function of three 
      polymorphic DNA markers at D4S127 and D4S95 loci shows no significant difference 
      in the average repeat length on HD chromosomes grouped according to the 
      cosegregating allele of each marker or to the corresponding haplotype. Despite 
      the marked heterogeneity in repeat length among HD families, haplotypes are not 
      associated with different values around which the repeat length fluctuates.

PG  - 157-62
AB  - The gene encoding the human serotonin transporter (5-HTT) has been isolated and 
      characterized. The human 5-HTT gene is composed of 14 exons spanning 
      approximately 31 kb. The sequence of all exons including adjacent intronic 
      sequences and a tandem repeat DNA polymorphism (VNTR) has been determined and 
      deposited in the EMBL/GenBank data base with the accession numbers X76753 to 
      X76762. The characterization of 5-HTT gene will aid to advance molecular 
      pharmacologic studies of 5-HT uptake regulation and facilitate investigations of 
      its role in psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Gametic but not somatic instability of CAG repeat length in Huntington's disease.
PG  - 982-6
AB  - Instability of a CAG repeat in 4p16.3 has been found in Huntington's disease (HD) 
      chromosomes. Unlike a similar repeat in the fragile X syndrome, the expanded HD 
      repeat showed no evidence of somatic instability in a comparison of blood, 
      lymphoblast, and brain DNA from the same persons. Four pairs of monozygotic HD 
      twins displayed identical CAG repeat lengths suggesting that repeat size is 
      determined in gametogenesis. In contrast with the fragile X syndrome and with HD 
      somatic tissue, mosaicism was readily detected as a diffuse spread of repeat 
      lengths in DNA from HD sperm samples. Typically, the modal repeat size was larger 
      in the sperm DNA than in corresponding lymphoblast DNA, with the greatest degree 
      of gametic mosaicism coinciding with the longest somatic CAG repeats. These data 
      indicate that the developmental timing of repeat instability appears to differ 
      between HD and fragile X syndrome, and that the fundamental mechanisms leading to 
      repeat expansion may therefore be distinct.

TI  - Huntington's disease in French families: CAG repeat expansion and linkage 
      disequilibrium analysis.
PG  - 1374-80
AB  - The molecular defect causing Huntington's disease (HD) has been found as an 
      expansion of CAG triplets in the 5' coding region of IT15 gene. In the 29 French 
      families reported, the HD disease is due to the expansion of the CAG triplets 
      region above 38 copies. The complete sequencing of 10 HD alleles PCR products 
      allowed us to confirm that expansion is restricted to the CAG repeat region and 
      does not extend to the adjacent CCG repeat region which is also present in the 
      PCR product. Then, we analysed linkage disequilibrium between the molecular 
      defect and 6 DNA markers mapping to the 4p16.3 region. The most striking finding 
      in this study is the presence of a strong linkage disequilibrium between HD and 
      D4S127 (PvuII), D4S95 (AccI, MboI, TaqI) located in a region of 130 kb distal to 
      IT15 gene. Two major haplotypes, comprising D4S127 (PvuII) and D4S95 (MboI, AccI) 
      polymorphic sites, were found in the normal population as only one was found 
      associated with HD alleles. This result can be interpreted either as an evidence 
      for a rather recent founder effect or as several independent mutations occuring 
      in chromosomes bearing the same haplotype.

TI  - FMR1 protein: conserved RNP family domains and selective RNA binding.
PG  - 563-6
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the result of transcriptional suppression of the gene FMR1 
      as a result of a trinucleotide repeat expansion mutation. The normal function of 
      the FMR1 protein (FMRP) and the mechanism by which its absence leads to mental 
      retardation are unknown. Ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) domains were identified 
      within FMRP, and RNA was shown to bind in stoichiometric ratios, which suggests 
      that there are two RNA binding sites per FMRP molecule. FMRP was able to bind to 
      its own message with high affinity (dissociation constant = 5.7 nM) and 
      interacted with approximately 4 percent of human fetal brain messages. The 
      absence of the normal interaction of FMRP with a subset of RNA molecules might 
      result in the pleiotropic phenotype associated with fragile X syndrome.

TI  - Relationship between trinucleotide repeat expansion and phenotypic variation in 
      Huntington's disease.
PG  - 393-7
AB  - The molecular analysis of a specific CAG repeat sequence in the Huntington's 
      disease gene in 440 Huntington's disease patients and 360 normal controls reveals 
      a range of 30-70 repeats in affected individuals and 9-34 in normals. We find 
      significant negative correlations between the number of repeats on the HD 
      chromosome and age at onset, regardless of sex of the transmitting parent, and 
      between the number of repeats on the normal paternal allele and age at onset in 
      individuals with maternally transmitted disease. This effect of the normal 
      paternal allele may account for the weaker age at onset correlation between 
      affected sib pairs with disease of maternal as opposed to paternal origin and 
      suggests that normal gene function varies because of the size of the repeat in 
      the normal range and a sex-specific modifying effect.

TI  - A single polymorphic STR system in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene 
      permits rapid prenatal diagnosis and carrier screening for phenylketonuria.
PG  - 577-81
AB  - Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by 
      phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency. Individuals afflicted with PKU 
      develop irreversible mental retardation that can be largely prevented by the 
      administration of a low-phenylalanine diet. A number of restriction 
      fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLPs) have been identified in the PAH gene. 
      Combinations of RFLPs constitute unique haplotypes that can be used to identify 
      mutant PAH chromosomes for prenatal diagnostic purpose in PKU families. 
      Unfortunately, the utility of haplotype analysis is limited in populations with a 
      single predominant haplotype. We have identified a novel short tandem repeat 
      (STR) within the PAH gene that has an average level of heterozygosity of about 
      75% in Orientals and about 80% in European Caucasian populations. This single 
      marker is as informative as haplotype analysis in Europeans and nearly twice as 
      informative as haplotype analysis in Orientals. Although there is statistically 
      significant disequilibrium between STR alleles and RFLP-based haplotypes, there 
      is a relatively low degree of disequilibrium between STR alleles and certain RFLP 
      sites. Nevertheless, the combined use of the STR and RFLP haplotype systems 
      increases the informativity of linkage-based tests for prenatal diagnosis and 
      carrier screening in PKU families.

TI  - Bloom's syndrome. XVIII. Hypermutability at a tandem-repeat locus.
PG  - 360-7
AB  - D1Z2 is a highly polymorphic DNA locus composed of a tandem of repetitive units. 
      Its molecular constitution has been examined in 61 clonal cell lines selected at 
      random from two lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), each of which had been 
      proliferating in vitro for several hundred days. Thirty-three of the cells were 
      selected from an LCL derived from the blood of a person with Bloom's syndrome 
      (BS), and the others from a normal person. A total of 20 distinctive band 
      alterations in D1Z2 were observed, all in BS cells: appearance of a novel 
      band(s); disappearance of a band(s), or alterations in the intensity of a 
      band(s). Unequal sister-chromatid exchange giving rise to intra-locus mutation is 
      considered the most plausible explanation for the accumulation of the changes 
      detected.

TI  - Genetic linkage of autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy 
      to chromosome 11q13.
PG  - 685-9
AB  - Autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV) is an 
      inherited eye disease characterized by retinal and iris neovascularization, 
      abnormal retinal pigmentation, anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation, 
      cystoid macular edema, vitreous hemorrhage, and traction retinal detachment. Some 
      of these clinical features are shared by more common, potentially blinding, 
      conditions including diabetic retinopathy, uveitis, and retinitis pigmentosa. 
      Elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis of ADNIV has the potential to provide 
      insight into the mechanisms of these common disorders. One hundred and sixteen 
      members of an eight generation family affected with ADNIV were examined. A 
      combination of slit lamp biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy, and electroretinography 
      was used to establish the diagnosis and 34 family members were found to be 
      affected. Blood samples were obtained from thirty-three of these individuals and 
      nine spouses and used for chromosome linkage analysis with denaturing gradient 
      gel and short tandem repeat polymorphisms. Two markers that map to chromosome 
      11q13 were found to be significantly linked to the ADNIV phenotype. There were no 
      recombinants between the disease phenotype and marker D11S527 and multipoint 
      analysis yielded a maximum LOD score of 11.9 centered on this marker.

TI  - Rapid diagnosis of Miller-Dieker syndrome and isolated lissencephaly sequence by 
      the polymerase chain reaction.
PG  - 555-9
AB  - Probe YNZ22 (D17S5) is a highly polymorphic, variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) 
      marker previously shown to be deleted in all patients with the Miller-Dieker 
      syndrome (MDS) but not in patients with isolated lissencephaly sequence (ILS). 
      Primers were constructed to the unique sequence flanking the polymorphic, 
      repetitive region of YNZ22 for amplification by the polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR). Analysis of 118 normal individuals revealed 12 alleles (differing in copy 
      number of a 70-bp repeat unit) ranging in size from 168 to 938 bp. A 
      retrospective study of eight MDS and six ILS patients was consistent with 
      Southern blot analysis in all cases except one. In the latter, a very large 
      allele (12 copies of the repeat unit) in a patient and her mother failed to 
      amplify on initial attempts, but was successfully amplified by reducing the 
      concentration of genomic DNA used in the reaction. Prospective studies on two MDS 
      and five ILS patients were successfully performed and confirmed in all cases by 
      Southern blot analysis. From the total sample, restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was fully informative in four of ten MDS patients 
      and showed a deletion in all four cases. Nine of eleven ILS patients were 
      heterozygous and therefore not deleted for YNZ22. Development of primers for 
      additional polymorphic markers in the Miller-Dieker region will lead to a rapid 
      PCR-based diagnostic approach for all MDS and ILS patients. PCR typing of YNZ22 
      will also facilitate use of this marker in other applications, including genetic 
      linkage, paternity and forensic studies, and analysis of loss of heterozygosity 
      in tumors.

TI  - Parental origin of the extra chromosome in trisomy 18.
PG  - 599-605
AB  - The parental origin of the supernumerary chromosome 18 was investigated by RFLP 
      analysis in 23 individuals with Edwards syndrome. All families were studied with 
      the DNA probe pERT-25, which recognizes a locus of highly polymorphic tandemly 
      repeated DNA sequences on chromosome 18. The extra chromosome was found to be of 
      maternal origin in 19 patients (95%), of paternal origin in one patient (5%), and 
      indeterminate in three patients. In one of the three indeterminate cases, a 
      mosaic, an apparent recombination event had taken place within the pERT-25 locus. 
      The overall high degree of informativeness of pERT-25 illustrates the power of a 
      chromosome-specific variable-number tandem repeat probe (VNTR) in parental origin 
      studies of aneuploidy.

TI  - Molecular dissection of a contiguous gene syndrome: frequent submicroscopic 
      deletions, evolutionarily conserved sequences, and a hypomethylated "island" in 
      the Miller-Dieker chromosome region.
PG  - 5136-40
AB  - The Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS), composed of characteristic facial abnormalities 
      and a severe neuronal migration disorder affecting the cerebral cortex, is caused 
      by visible or submicroscopic deletions of chromosome band 17p13. Twelve anonymous 
      DNA markers were tested against a panel of somatic cell hybrids containing 17p 
      deletions from seven MDS patients. All patients, including three with normal 
      karyotypes, are deleted for a variable set of 5-12 markers. Two highly 
      polymorphic VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) probes, YNZ22 and YNH37, are 
      codeleted in all patients tested and make molecular diagnosis for this disorder 
      feasible. By pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, YNZ22 and YNH37 were shown to be 
      within 30 kilobases (kb) of each other. Cosmid clones containing both VNTR 
      sequences were identified, and restriction mapping showed them to be less than 15 
      kb apart. Three overlapping cosmids spanning greater than 100 kb were completely 
      deleted in all patients, providing a minimum estimate of the size of the MDS 
      critical region. A hypomethylated island and evolutionarily conserved sequences 
      were identified within this 100-kb region, indications of the presence of one or 
      more expressed sequences potentially involved in the pathophysiology of this 
      disorder. The conserved sequences were mapped to mouse chromosome 11 by using 
      mouse-rat somatic cell hybrids, extending the remarkable homology between human 
      chromosome 17 and mouse chromosome 11 by 30 centimorgans, into the 17p telomere 
      region.

TI  - Evidence from family studies that the gene causing Huntington disease is 
      telomeric to D4S95 and D4S90.
PG  - 422-5
AB  - A DNA probe (D4S95) that detects a variable number of tandem repeats and a 
      single-site-variation polymorphism after digestion with a single restriction 
      enzyme, AccI, has previously been described. The order of this probe relative to 
      the gene for Huntington disease (HD) and other previously described markers has 
      not been established. Analysis of 24 affected families with HD has shown that 
      D4S95 is in tight linkage with the gene causing HD, with a maximal Lod score of 
      12.489 at a theta of .03. D4S90 is a probe which maps to 4p16.3, telomeric to 
      D4S95, and detects polymorphisms with HincII and other enzymes. In one affected 
      person, recombination has occurred between D4S10 and HD, between D4S95 and HD, 
      and in all likelihood also between D4S90 and HD, which strongly suggests that the 
      gene for HD is telomeric to all these DNA probes. This suggests that the gene 
      causing HD is located in the most distal region of the short arm of chromosome 4, 
      flanked by D4S90 and the telomere, and supports the locus order 
      D4S10-D4S95-D4S90-HD-telomere. D4S95 is a most useful DNA marker for predictive 
      testing programs, while D4S90 will serve as a useful starting point for 
      identifying DNA fragments closer to the gene for HD.
