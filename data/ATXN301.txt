AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a genetic degeneration disease of the 
      nervous system with ataxia as the main clinical manifestation, and the most 
      frequent subtype of SCA3 is known to be caused by CAG repeat expansions of more 
      than 55 units in ATXN3. In this study, we used peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
      (PBMCs) from a volunteer with 14/63 CAG repeats in ATXN3 to generate induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which will be a good model for studying SCA3.

TI  - Prevalence of repeat expansions causing autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      ataxias in Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan.
LID - 10.1038/s10038-023-01200-x [doi]
AB  - In Japan, approximately 30% of spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) is hereditary, 
      and more than 90% of hereditary SCD is autosomal dominant SCD (AD-SCD). We have 
      previously reported the types of AD-SCD in Hokkaido, twice. In this study, we 
      investigated the status of AD-SCD mainly due to repeat expansions, covering the 
      period since the last report. We performed genetic analysis for 312 patients with 
      a clinical diagnosis of SCD, except for multiple system atrophy at medical 
      institutions in Hokkaido between January 2007 and December 2020. The median age 
      at the time of analysis was 58 (1-86) years. Pathogenic variants causing AD-SCD 
      due to repeat expansion were found in 61.5% (192 cases). Spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) 6 was the most common type in 25.3% (79 cases), followed by Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD)/SCA3 in 13.8% (43), SCA1 in 6.4% (20), SCA2 in 5.1% (16), SCA31 in 
      4.8% (15), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy in 4.8% (15), SCA7 in 0.6% (2), 
      and SCA8 in 0.6% (2). SCA17, 27B, 36, and 37 were not found. Compared to previous 
      reports, this study found a higher prevalence of SCA6 and a lower prevalence of 
      MJD/SCA3. An increasing number of cases identified by genetic testing, including 
      cases with no apparent family history, accurately revealed the distribution of 
      disease types in Hokkaido.

LID - 2397
AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction has been described in many neurodegenerative disorders; 
      however, there is less information regarding mitochondrial deficits in 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), a polyglutamine (polyQ) disorder caused by CAG 
      repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. In the present study, we characterized the 
      changes in mitochondrial function and biogenesis markers in two MJD models, 
      CMVMJD135 (MJD135) transgenic mice at a fully established phenotype stage and 
      tetracycline-regulated PC6-3 Q108 cell line expressing mutant ataxin-3 (mATXN3). 
      We detected mATXN3 in the mitochondrial fractions of PC6-3 Q108 cells, suggesting 
      the interaction of expanded ATXN3 with the organelle. Interestingly, in both the 
      cerebella of the MJD135 mouse model and in PC6-3 Q108 cells, we found decreased 
      mitochondrial respiration, ATP production and mitochondrial membrane potential, 
      strongly suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction in MJD. Also, in PC6-3 Q108 cells, 
      an additional enhanced glycolytic flux was observed. Supporting the functional 
      deficits observed in MJD mitochondria, MJD135 mouse cerebellum and PC6-3 Q108 
      cells showed reduced cytochrome c mRNA and protein levels. Overall, our findings 
      show compromised mitochondrial function associated with decreased cytochrome c 
      levels in both cell and animal models of MJD.

TI  - Frequency of GAA-FGF14 Ataxia in a Large Cohort of Brazilian Patients With 
      Unsolved Adult-Onset Cerebellar Ataxia.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Intronic FGF14 GAA repeat expansions have recently been found to be a 
      common cause of hereditary ataxia (GAA-FGF14 ataxia; SCA27B). The global 
      epidemiology and regional prevalence of this newly reported disorder remain to be 
      established. In this study, we investigated the frequency of GAA-FGF14 ataxia in 
      a large cohort of Brazilian patients with unsolved adult-onset ataxia. METHODS: 
      We recruited 93 index patients with genetically unsolved adult-onset ataxia 
      despite extensive genetic investigation and genotyped the FGF14 repeat locus. 
      Patients were recruited across 4 different regions of Brazil. RESULTS: Of the 93 
      index patients, 8 (9%) carried an FGF14 (GAA)(>/=250) expansion. The expansion was 
      also identified in 1 affected relative. Seven patients were of European descent, 
      1 was of African descent, and 1was of admixed American ancestry. One patient 
      carrying a (GAA)(376) expansion developed ataxia at age 28 years, confirming that 
      GAA-FGF14 ataxia can occur before the age of 30 years. One patient displayed 
      episodic symptoms, while none had downbeat nystagmus. Cerebellar atrophy was 
      observed on brain MRI in 7 of 8 patients (87%). DISCUSSION: Our results suggest 
      that GAA-FGF14 ataxia is a common cause of adult-onset ataxia in the Brazilian 
      population, although larger studies are needed to fully define its epidemiology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intronic GAA repeat expansions in the fibroblast growth factor 14 
      gene (FGF14) have recently been identified as a common cause of ataxia with 
      potential phenotypic overlap with RFC1-related cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). Our objective was to report on the 
      frequency of intronic FGF14 GAA repeat expansions in patients with an unexplained 
      CANVAS-like phenotype. METHODS: We recruited 45 patients negative for biallelic 
      RFC1 repeat expansions with a combination of cerebellar ataxia plus peripheral 
      neuropathy and/or bilateral vestibulopathy (BVP), and genotyped the FGF14 repeat 
      locus. Phenotypic features of GAA-FGF14-positive versus GAA-FGF14-negative 
      patients were compared. RESULTS: Frequency of FGF14 GAA repeat expansions was 38% 
      (17/45) in the entire cohort, 38% (5/13) in the subgroup with cerebellar ataxia 
      plus polyneuropathy, 43% (9/21) in the subgroup with cerebellar ataxia plus BVP 
      and 27% (3/11) in patients with all three features. BVP was observed in 75% 
      (12/16) of GAA-FGF14-positive patients. Polyneuropathy was at most mild and of 
      mixed sensorimotor type in six of eight GAA-FGF14-positive patients. Family 
      history of ataxia (59% vs 15%; p=0.007) was significantly more frequent and 
      permanent cerebellar dysarthria (12% vs 54%; p=0.009) significantly less frequent 
      in GAA-FGF14-positive than in GAA-FGF14-negative patients. Age at onset was 
      inversely correlated to the size of the repeat expansion (Pearson's r, -0.67; 
      R(2)=0.45; p=0.0031). CONCLUSIONS: GAA-FGF14-related disease is a common cause of 
      cerebellar ataxia with polyneuropathy and/or BVP, and should be included in the 
      differential diagnosis of RFC1 CANVAS and disease spectrum.

AB  - There are more than 40 types of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), most of which are 
      caused by abnormal expansion of short tandem repeats at various gene loci. These 
      phenotypically similar disorders require molecular testing at multiple loci by 
      fluorescent PCR and capillary electrophoresis to identify the causative repeat 
      expansion. We describe a simple strategy to screen for the more common SCA1, 
      SCA2, and SCA3 by rapidly detecting the abnormal CAG repeat expansion at the 
      ATXN1, ATXN2, and ATXN3 loci using melting curve analysis of triplet-primed PCR 
      products. Each of the three separate assays employs a plasmid DNA carrying a 
      known repeat size to generate a threshold melt peak temperature, which 
      effectively distinguishes expansion-positive samples from those without a repeat 
      expansion. Samples that are screened positive based on their melt peak profiles 
      are subjected to capillary electrophoresis for repeat sizing and genotype 
      confirmation. These screening assays are robust and provide accurate detection of 
      the repeat expansion while eliminating the need for fluorescent PCR and capillary 
      electrophoresis for every sample.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To perform a screening for Huntington disease (HD) phenocopies in a 
      Swedish cohort. METHODS: Seventy-three DNA samples negative for HD were assessed 
      at a tertiary center in Stockholm. The screening included analyses for 
      C9orf72-frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9orf72-FTD/ALS), 
      octapeptide repeat insertions (OPRIs) in PRNP associated with inherited prion 
      diseases (IPD), Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2), spinocerebellar ataxia-2 
      (SCA2), spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) and spinocerebellar ataxia-17 (SCA17). 
      Targeted genetic analysis was carried out in two cases based on the salient 
      phenotypic features. RESULTS: The screening identified two patients with SCA17, 
      one patient with IPD associated with 5-OPRI but none with nucleotide expansions 
      in C9orf72 or for HDL2, SCA2 or SCA3. Furthermore, SGCE-myoclonic-dystonia 11 
      (SGCE-M-D) and benign hereditary chorea (BHC) was diagnosed in two sporadic 
      cases. WES identified VUS in STUB1 in two patients with predominant cerebellar 
      ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in keeping with previous screenings and 
      suggest that other genes yet to be discovered are involved in the etiology of HD 
      phenocopies.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph disease, is 
      the most common dominantly inherited ataxia. SCA3 is caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the ATXN3 gene that encodes an expanded tract of polyglutamine in 
      the disease protein ataxin-3 (ATXN3). As a deubiquitinating enzyme, ATXN3 
      regulates numerous cellular processes including proteasome- and 
      autophagy-mediated protein degradation. In SCA3 disease brain, polyQ-expanded 
      ATXN3 accumulates with other cellular constituents, including ubiquitin 
      (Ub)-modified proteins, in select areas like the cerebellum and the brainstem, 
      but whether pathogenic ATXN3 affects the abundance of ubiquitinated species is 
      unknown. Here, in mouse and cellular models of SCA3, we investigated whether 
      elimination of murine Atxn3 or expression of wild-type or polyQ-expanded human 
      ATXN3 alters soluble levels of overall ubiquitination, as well as K48-linked 
      (K48-Ub) and K63-linked (K63-Ub) chains. Levels of ubiquitination were assessed 
      in the cerebellum and brainstem of 7- and 47-week-old Atxn3 knockout and SCA3 
      transgenic mice, and also in relevant mouse and human cell lines. In older mice, 
      we observed that wild-type ATXN3 impacts the cerebellar levels of K48-Ub 
      proteins. In contrast, pathogenic ATXN3 leads to decreased brainstem abundance of 
      K48-Ub species in younger mice and changes in both cerebellar and brainstem 
      K63-Ub levels in an age-dependent manner: younger SCA3 mice have higher levels of 
      K63-Ub while older mice have lower levels of K63-Ub compared to controls. Human 
      SCA3 neuronal progenitor cells also show a relative increase in K63-Ub proteins 
      upon autophagy inhibition. We conclude that wild-type and mutant ATXN3 
      differentially impact K48-Ub- and K63-Ub-modified proteins in the brain in a 
      region- and age-dependent manner.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging studies suggest that whole genome sequencing provides 
      additional diagnostic yield of genomic variants when compared with chromosomal 
      microarray analysis in the etiologic diagnosis of infants and children with 
      suspected genetic diseases. However, the application and evaluation of whole 
      genome sequencing in prenatal diagnosis remain limited. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      aimed to evaluate the accuracy, efficacy, and incremental yield of whole genome 
      sequencing in comparison with chromosomal microarray analysis for routine 
      prenatal diagnosis. STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective study, a total of 185 
      unselected singleton fetuses with ultrasound-detected structural anomalies were 
      enrolled. In parallel, each sample was subjected to whole genome sequencing and 
      chromosomal microarray analysis. Aneuploidies and copy number variations were 
      detected and analyzed in a blinded fashion. Single nucleotide variations and 
      insertions and deletions were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and trinucleotide 
      repeats expansion variants were verified using polymerase chain reaction plus 
      fragment-length analysis. RESULTS: Overall, genetic diagnoses using whole genome 
      sequencing were obtained for 28 (15.1%) cases. Whole genome sequencing not only 
      detected all these aneuploidies and copy number variations in the 20 (10.8%) 
      diagnosed cases identified by chromosomal microarray analysis, but also detected 
      1 case with an exonic deletion of COL4A2 and 7 (3.8%) cases with single 
      nucleotide variations or insertions and deletions. In addition, 3 incidental 
      findings were detected including an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat in 
      ATXN3, a splice-sites variant in ATRX, and an ANXA11 missense mutation in a case 
      of trisomy 21. CONCLUSION: Compared with chromosomal microarray analysis, whole 
      genome sequencing increased the additional detection rate by 5.9% (11/185). Using 
      whole genome sequencing, we detected not only aneuploidies and copy number 
      variations, but also single nucleotide variations and insertions and deletions, 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions, and exonic copy number variations with high 
      accuracy in an acceptable turnaround time (3-4 weeks). Our results suggest that 
      whole genome sequencing has the potential to be a new promising prenatal 
      diagnostic test for fetal structural anomalies.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. Though the ATXN3 protein is expressed 
      ubiquitously throughout the CNS, regional pathology in SCA3 patients is observed 
      within select neuronal populations and more recently within oligodendrocyte-rich 
      white matter tracts. We have previously recapitulated these white matter 
      abnormalities in an overexpression mouse model of SCA3 and demonstrated that 
      oligodendrocyte maturation impairments are one of the earliest and most 
      progressive changes in SCA3 pathogenesis. Disease-associated oligodendrocyte 
      signatures have recently emerged as significant contributors to several other 
      neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, 
      and Parkinson's disease, but their role in regional vulnerability and disease 
      progression remains unexplored. Here, we are the first to comparatively assess 
      myelination in human tissue in a region-dependent manner. Translating these 
      findings to SCA3 mouse models of disease, we confirmed endogenous expression of 
      mutant Atxn3 leads to regional transcriptional dysregulation of oligodendrocyte 
      maturation markers in Knock-In models of SCA3. We then investigated the 
      spatiotemporal progression of mature oligodendrocyte transcriptional 
      dysregulation in an overexpression SCA3 mouse model and how it relates to the 
      onset of motor impairment. We further determined that regional reduction in 
      mature oligodendrocyte cell counts in SCA3 mice over time parallels the onset and 
      progression of brain atrophy in SCA3 patients. This work emphasizes the 
      prospective contributions of disease-associated oligodendrocyte signatures to 
      regional vulnerability and could inform timepoints and target regions imperative 
      for biomarker assessment and therapeutic intervention in several 
      neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3) is a member of the family of polyglutamine 
      (polyQ) diseases that are caused by anomalous CAG triplet repeat expansions in 
      several genes. SCA3 results from abnormal polyQ expansion in the deubiquitinase 
      (DUB), ataxin-3 (Atxn3). To understand the role of the different domains of 
      mutant Atxn3 on its pathogenicity, with the hope that they can be explored for 
      therapeutic interventions, we have systematically studied their individual and 
      collective effects on its toxicity. One such domain is ubiquitin-binding site 1 
      (UbS1) on the catalytic domain of Atxn3; UbS1 is necessary for the enzymatic 
      activity of Atxn3. Here, we investigated the importance of UbS1 on the toxicity 
      of pathogenic Atxn3. We generated transgenic Drosophila melanogaster lines that 
      express polyQ-expanded Atxn3 with and without a functional UbS1. We found that 
      mutating UbS1 markedly exacerbates the toxicity of pathogenic Atxn3. Additional 
      studies indicated that UbS1 regulates the toxicity of Atxn3 not by affecting its 
      aggregation or sub-cellular localization, but by impacting its role in ubiquitin 
      processing. Our findings provide additional insights into the role of Atxn3's 
      domains in the pathogenicity of SCA3.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxias (CAs) represent a group of autosomal dominant and recessive 
      neurodegenerative disorders affecting cerebellum with or without spinal cord. 
      Overall, CAs have preponderance for tandem nucleotide repeat expansions as an 
      etiological factor (10 TREs explain nearly 30-40% of ataxia cohort globally). The 
      experience of 10 years of common genetic ataxia subtypes for  approximately 5600 patients' 
      referrals (Pan-India) received at a single center is shared herein. Frequencies 
      (in %, n) of SCA types and FRDA in the sample cohort are observed as follows: 
      SCA12 (8.6%, 490); SCA2 (8.5%, 482); SCA1 (4.8%, 272); SCA3 (2%, 113); SCA7 
      (0.5%, 28); SCA6 (0.1%, 05); SCA17 (0.1%, 05), and FRDA (2.2%, 127). A 
      significant amount of variability in TRE lengths at each locus is observed, we 
      noted presence of biallelic expansion, co-occurrence of SCA-subtypes, and the 
      presence of premutable normal alleles. The frequency of mutated GAA-FRDA allele 
      in healthy controls is 1/158 (0.63%), thus an expected FRDA prevalence of 1:100 
      000 persons. The data of this study are relevant not only for clinical decision 
      making but also for guidance in direction of genetic investigations, 
      transancestral comparison of genotypes, and lastly provide insight for policy 
      decision for the consideration of SCAs under rare disease category.

TI  - Diagnostic Efficacy of Genetic Studies in a Series of Hereditary Cerebellar 
      Ataxias in Eastern Spain.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic efficacy of clinical 
      exome-targeted sequencing (CES) and spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36) screening 
      in a real-life cohort of patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) from Eastern Spain. 
      METHODS: A total of 130 unrelated patients with CA, negative for common 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, 
      SCA17, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA], and Friedreich ataxia), were 
      studied with CES. Bioinformatic and genotype-phenotype analyses were performed to 
      assess the pathogenicity of the variants encountered. Copy number variants were 
      analyzed when appropriate. In undiagnosed dominant and sporadic cases, repeat 
      primed PCR was used to screen for the presence of a repeat expansion in the NOP56 
      gene. RESULTS: CES identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 50 
      families (39%), including 23 novel variants. Overall, there was a high genetic 
      heterogeneity, and the most frequent genetic diagnosis was SPG7 (n = 15), 
      followed by SETX (n = 6), CACNA1A (n = 5), POLR3A (n = 4), and SYNE1 (n = 3). In 
      addition, 17 families displayed likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants in 14 
      different genes: KCND3 (n = 2), KIF1C (n = 2), CYP27A1A (n = 2), AFG3L2 (n = 1), 
      ANO10 (n = 1), CAPN1 (n = 1), CWF19L1 (n = 1), ITPR1 (n = 1), KCNA1 (n = 1), OPA1 
      (n = 1), PNPLA6 (n = 1), SPG11 (n = 1), SPTBN2 (n = 1), and TPP1 (n = 1). 
      Twenty-two novel variants were characterized. SCA36 was diagnosed in 11 families, 
      all with autosomal dominant (AD) presentation. SCA36 screening increased the 
      total diagnostic rate to 47% (n = 61/130). Ultimately, undiagnosed patients 
      showed delayed age at onset (p < 0.05) and were more frequently sporadic. 
      DISCUSSION: Our study provides insight into the genetic landscape of CA in 
      Eastern Spain. Although CES was an effective approach to capture genetic 
      heterogeneity, most patients remained undiagnosed. SCA36 was found to be a 
      relatively frequent form and, therefore, should be tested prior to CES in 
      familial AD presentations in particular geographical regions.

TI  - Deep Intronic FGF14 GAA Repeat Expansion in Late-Onset Cerebellar Ataxia.
PG  - 128-141
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2207406 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The late-onset cerebellar ataxias (LOCAs) have largely resisted 
      molecular diagnosis. METHODS: We sequenced the genomes of six persons with 
      autosomal dominant LOCA who were members of three French Canadian families and 
      identified a candidate pathogenic repeat expansion. We then tested for 
      association between the repeat expansion and disease in two independent 
      case-control series - one French Canadian (66 patients and 209 controls) and the 
      other German (228 patients and 199 controls). We also genotyped the repeat in 20 
      Australian and 31 Indian index patients. We assayed gene and protein expression 
      in two postmortem cerebellum specimens and two induced pluripotent stem-cell 
      (iPSC)-derived motor-neuron cell lines. RESULTS: In the six French Canadian 
      patients, we identified a GAA repeat expansion deep in the first intron of FGF14, 
      which encodes fibroblast growth factor 14. Cosegregation of the repeat expansion 
      with disease in the families supported a pathogenic threshold of at least 250 GAA 
      repeats ([GAA](>/=250)). There was significant association between FGF14 
      (GAA)(>/=250) expansions and LOCA in the French Canadian series (odds ratio, 
      105.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 31.09 to 334.20; P<0.001) and in the German 
      series (odds ratio, 8.76; 95% CI, 3.45 to 20.84; P<0.001). The repeat expansion 
      was present in 61%, 18%, 15%, and 10% of French Canadian, German, Australian, and 
      Indian index patients, respectively. In total, we identified 128 patients with 
      LOCA who carried an FGF14 (GAA)(>/=250) expansion. Postmortem cerebellum specimens 
      and iPSC-derived motor neurons from patients showed reduced expression of FGF14 
      RNA and protein. CONCLUSIONS: A dominantly inherited deep intronic GAA repeat 
      expansion in FGF14 was found to be associated with LOCA. (Funded by Fondation

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressively fatal neurodegenerative 
      disease affecting motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. In this study, we 
      investigated gene expression changes in ALS via RNA sequencing in 380 postmortem 
      samples from cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord segments from 154 
      individuals with ALS and 49 control individuals. We observed an increase in 
      microglia and astrocyte gene expression, accompanied by a decrease in 
      oligodendrocyte gene expression. By creating a gene co-expression network in the 
      ALS samples, we identified several activated microglia modules that negatively 
      correlate with retrospective disease duration. We mapped molecular quantitative 
      trait loci and found several potential ALS risk loci that may act through gene 
      expression or splicing in the spinal cord and assign putative cell types for 
      FNBP1, ACSL5, SH3RF1 and NFASC. Finally, we outline how common genetic variants 
      associated with splicing of C9orf72 act as proxies for the well-known repeat 
      expansion, and we use the same mechanism to suggest ATXN3 as a putative risk 
      gene.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by progressive motor and nonmotor deficits concomitant with 
      degenerative pathophysiological changes within the cerebellum. The cerebellum is 
      topographically organized into cerebello-cerebral circuits that create distinct 
      functional networks regulating movement, cognition, and affect. SCA3-associated 
      motor and nonmotor symptoms are possibly related not only to intracerebellar 
      changes but also to disruption of the connectivity within these 
      cerebello-cerebral circuits. However, to date, no comprehensive investigation of 
      cerebello-cerebral connectivity in SCA3 has been conducted. The present study 
      aimed to identify cerebello-cerebral functional connectivity alterations and 
      associations with downstream clinical phenotypes and upstream topographic markers 
      of cerebellar neurodegeneration in patients with SCA3. This study included 45 
      patients with SCA3 and 49 healthy controls. Voxel-based morphometry and 
      resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed to 
      characterize the cerebellar atrophy and to examine the cerebello-cerebral 
      functional connectivity patterns. Structural MRI confirmed widespread gray matter 
      atrophy in the motor and cognitive cerebellum of patients with SCA3. We found 
      reduced functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortical 
      networks, including the somatomotor, frontoparietal, and default networks; 
      however, increased connectivity was observed between the cerebellum and the 
      dorsal attention network. These abnormal patterns correlated with the CAG repeat 
      expansion and deficits in global cognition. Our results indicate the contribution 
      of cerebello-cerebral networks to the motor and cognitive impairments in patients 
      with SCA3 and reveal that such alterations occur in association with cerebellar 
      atrophy. These findings add important insights into our understanding of the role 
      of the cerebellum in SCA3.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are progressive neurodegenerative disorders, but 
      there is no metric that predicts disease severity over time. We hypothesized that 
      by developing a new metric, the Severity Factor (S-Factor) using immutable 
      disease parameters, it would be possible to capture disease severity independent 
      of clinical rating scales. Extracting data from the CRC-SCA and READISCA natural 
      history studies, we calculated the S-Factor for 438 participants with symptomatic 
      SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6, as follows: ((length of CAG repeat expansion - maximum 
      normal repeat length) /maximum normal repeat length) x (current age - age at 
      disease onset) x 10). Within each SCA type, the S-Factor at the first Scale for 
      the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) visit (baseline) was correlated 
      against scores on SARA and other motor and cognitive assessments. In 281 
      participants with longitudinal data, the slope of the S-Factor over time was 
      correlated against slopes of scores on SARA and other motor rating scales. At 
      baseline, the S-Factor showed moderate-to-strong correlations with SARA and other 
      motor rating scales at the group level, but not with cognitive performance. 
      Longitudinally the S-Factor slope showed no consistent association with the slope 
      of performance on motor scales. Approximately 30% of SARA slopes reflected a 
      trend of non-progression in motor symptoms. The S-Factor is an 
      observer-independent metric of disease burden in SCAs. It may be useful at the 
      group level to compare cohorts at baseline in clinical studies. Derivation and 
      examination of the S-factor highlighted challenges in the use of clinical rating 
      scales in this population.

AB  - The most common autosomal dominant ataxia worldwide, spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3 (SCA3) is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. Here we report the generation 
      of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line UM134-1, the first SCA3 disease-specific 
      hESC line to be added to the NIH hESC registry. UM134-1 pluripotency was 
      confirmed by immunocytochemistry and PCR for pluripotency markers and by the 
      ability to form three germ layers in vitro. The established hESC line provides a 
      useful new human cell model to study the pathogenesis of SCA3.

AB  - Defects in ataxin-3 proteins and CAG repeat expansions in its coding gene ATXN3 
      cause Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3) or Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) 
      polyglutamine neurodegenerative disease. The mutant proteins aggregate as 
      inclusion bodies in cells and compete with wild-type ataxin-3, which leads to 
      neuronal dysfunction or death and impairs Beclin1-mediated autophagy. It has been 
      reported that Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can reliably treat several 
      neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we used a Transcription Factor EB (TFEB) 
      nuclear translocation-mediated MSCs co-culture approach to reconstitute autophagy 
      and lysosomal biogenesis, and reduce SCA3-like behaviors in induced pluripotent 
      stem cells (iPSCs)-derived neuron cells models. Our iPSCs model showed enhanced 
      expression of autophagy proteins, attenuated the expression and toxic effects of 
      mutant ataxin-3 on neurons, and alleviated the effects of ataxin-3 on autophagy. 
      Therefore, MSCs are associated with autophagy-inducing therapy and compared to 
      animal models, our MSCs co-culture could be used as a novel and potential 
      therapeutic approach to study SCA3 disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - RNA toxicity contributes to diseases caused by anomalous nucleotide repeat 
      expansions. Recent work demonstrated RNA-based toxicity from repeat-associated, 
      non-AUG-initiated translation (RAN translation). RAN translation occurs around 
      long nucleotide repeats that form hairpin loops, allowing for translation 
      initiation in the absence of a start codon that results in potentially toxic, 
      poly-amino acid repeat-containing proteins. Discovered in Spinocerebellar Ataxia 
      Type (SCA) 8, RAN translation has been documented in several repeat-expansion 
      diseases, including in the CAG repeat-dependent polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders. 
      The ATXN3 gene, which causes SCA3, also known as Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD), 
      contains a CAG repeat that is expanded in disease. ATXN3 mRNA possesses features 
      linked to RAN translation. In this paper, we examined the potential contribution 
      of RAN translation to SCA3/MJD in Drosophila by using isogenic lines that contain 
      homomeric or interrupted CAG repeats. We did not observe unconventional 
      translation in fly neurons or glia. However, our investigations indicate 
      differential toxicity from ATXN3 protein-encoding mRNA that contains pure versus 
      interrupted CAG repeats. Additional work suggests that this difference may be due 
      in part to toxicity from homomeric CAG mRNA. We conclude that Drosophila is not 
      suitable to model RAN translation for SCA3/MJD, but offers clues into the 
      potential pathogenesis stemming from CAG repeat-containing mRNA in this disorder.

AB  - The age at onset of motor symptoms in Huntington's disease (HD) is driven by HTT 
      CAG repeat length but modified by other genes. In this study, we used exome 
      sequencing of 683 patients with HD with extremes of onset or phenotype relative 
      to CAG length to identify rare variants associated with clinical effect. We 
      discovered damaging coding variants in candidate modifier genes identified in 
      previous genome-wide association studies associated with altered HD onset or 
      severity. Variants in FAN1 clustered in its DNA-binding and nuclease domains and 
      were associated predominantly with earlier-onset HD. Nuclease activities of 
      purified variants in vitro correlated with residual age at motor onset of HD. 
      Mutating endogenous FAN1 to a nuclease-inactive form in an induced pluripotent 
      stem cell model of HD led to rates of CAG expansion similar to those observed 
      with complete FAN1 knockout. Together, these data implicate FAN1 nuclease 
      activity in slowing somatic repeat expansion and hence onset of HD.

      disorders in the UK: a retrospective diagnostic accuracy and prospective clinical 
      validation study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansion disorders affect about 1 in 3000 individuals and are 
      clinically heterogeneous diseases caused by expansions of short tandem DNA 
      repeats. Genetic testing is often locus-specific, resulting in underdiagnosis of 
      people who have atypical clinical presentations, especially in paediatric 
      patients without a previous positive family history. Whole genome sequencing is 
      increasingly used as a first-line test for other rare genetic disorders, and we 
      aimed to assess its performance in the diagnosis of patients with neurological 
      repeat expansion disorders. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic 
      accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect the most common repeat expansion 
      loci associated with neurological outcomes (AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, 
      C9orf72, CACNA1A, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, and TBP) using samples obtained within 
      the National Health Service in England from patients who were suspected of having 
      neurological disorders; previous PCR test results were used as the reference 
      standard. The clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat 
      expansions was prospectively examined in previously genetically tested and 
      undiagnosed patients recruited in 2013-17 to the 100 000 Genomes Project in the 
      UK, who were suspected of having a genetic neurological disorder (familial or 
      early-onset forms of ataxia, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, dementia, motor 
      neuron disease, parkinsonian movement disorders, intellectual disability, or 
      neuromuscular disorders). If a repeat expansion call was made using whole genome 
      sequencing, PCR was used to confirm the result. FINDINGS: The diagnostic accuracy 
      of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat expansions was evaluated against 793 
      PCR tests previously performed within the NHS from 404 patients. Whole genome 
      sequencing correctly classified 215 of 221 expanded alleles and 1316 of 1321 
      non-expanded alleles, showing 97.3% sensitivity (95% CI 94.2-99.0) and 99.6% 
      specificity (99.1-99.9) across the 13 disease-associated loci when compared with 
      PCR test results. In samples from 11 631 patients in the 100 000 Genomes Project, 
      whole genome sequencing identified 81 repeat expansions, which were also tested 
      by PCR: 68 were confirmed as repeat expansions in the full pathogenic range, 11 
      were non-pathogenic intermediate expansions or premutations, and two were 
      non-expanded repeats (16% false discovery rate). INTERPRETATION: In our study, 
      whole genome sequencing for the detection of repeat expansions showed high 
      sensitivity and specificity, and it led to identification of neurological repeat 
      expansion disorders in previously undiagnosed patients. These findings support 
      implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical laboratories for diagnosis 
      of patients who have a neurological presentation consistent with a repeat 
      expansion disorder. FUNDING: Medical Research Council, Department of Health and

TI  - Genetic Distribution of Five Spinocerebellar Ataxia Microsatellite Loci in 
      Mexican Native American Populations and Its Impact on Contemporary Mestizo 
      Populations.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) conform a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders with autosomal dominant inheritance. Five of the most frequent SCAs are 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the exons of specific genes. The SCAs 
      incidence and the distribution of polymorphic CAG alleles vary among populations 
      and ethnicities. Thus, characterization of the genetic architecture of ethnically 
      diverse populations, which have undergone recent admixture and demographic 
      events, could facilitate the identification of genetic risk factors. Owing to the 
      great ethnic diversity of the Mexican population, this study aimed to analyze the 
      allele frequencies of five SCA microsatellite loci (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and 
      SCA7) in eleven Mexican Native American (MNA) populations. Data from the 
      literature were used to compare the allelic distribution of SCA loci with 
      worldwide populations. The SCA loci allelic frequencies evidenced a certain 
      genetic homogeneity in the MNA populations, except for Mayans, who exhibited 
      distinctive genetic profiles. Neither pathological nor large normal alleles were 
      found in MNA populations, except for the SCA2 pre-mutated allele in the Zapotec 
      population. Collectively, our findings demonstrated the contribution of the MNA 
      ancestry in shaping the genetic structure of contemporary Mexican Mestizo 
      populations. Our results also suggest that Native American ancestry has no impact 
      on the origin of SCAs in the Mexican population. Instead, the acquisition of 
      pathological SCA alleles could be associated with European migration.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia Type 3 (SCA3), the most common dominantly inherited 
      ataxia, is a polyglutamine neurodegenerative disease for which there is no 
      disease-modifying therapy. The polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the 
      ATXN3 gene results in expression of a mutant form of the ATXN3 protein, a 
      deubiquitinase that causes selective neurodegeneration despite being widely 
      expressed. The mechanisms driving neurodegeneration in SCA3 are unclear. Research 
      to date, however, has focused almost exclusively on neurons. Here, using equal 
      male and female age-matched transgenic mice expressing full-length human mutant 
      ATXN3, we identified early and robust transcriptional changes in selectively 
      vulnerable brain regions that implicate oligodendrocytes in disease pathogenesis. 
      We mapped transcriptional changes across early, mid, and late stages of disease 
      in two selectively vulnerable brain regions: the cerebellum and brainstem. The 
      most significant disease-associated module through weighted gene coexpression 
      network analysis revealed dysfunction in SCA3 oligodendrocyte maturation. These 
      results reflect a toxic gain-of-function mechanism, as ATXN3 KO mice do not 
      exhibit any impairments in oligodendrocyte maturation. Genetic crosses to 
      reporter mice revealed a marked reduction in mature oligodendrocytes in 
      SCA3-disease vulnerable brain regions, and ultrastructural microscopy confirmed 
      abnormalities in axonal myelination. Further study of isolated oligodendrocyte 
      precursor cells from SCA3 mice established that this impairment in 
      oligodendrocyte maturation is a cell-autonomous process. We conclude that SCA3 is 
      not simply a disease of neurons, and the search for therapeutic strategies and 
      disease biomarkers will need to account for non-neuronal involvement in SCA3 
      pathogenesis.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Despite advances in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      Type 3 (SCA3) disease understanding, much remains unknown about how the disease 
      gene causes brain dysfunction ultimately leading to cell death. We completed a 
      longitudinal transcriptomic analysis of vulnerable brain regions in SCA3 mice to 
      define the earliest and most robust changes across disease progression. Through 
      gene network analyses followed up with biochemical and histologic studies in SCA3 
      mice, we provide evidence for severe dysfunction in oligodendrocyte maturation 
      early in SCA3 pathogenesis. Our results advance understanding of SCA3 disease 
      mechanisms, identify additional routes for therapeutic intervention, and may 
      provide broader insight into polyglutamine diseases beyond SCA3.

TI  - A Novel SCA3 Knock-in Mouse Model Mimics the Human SCA3 Disease Phenotype 
      Including Neuropathological, Behavioral, and Transcriptional Abnormalities 
      Especially in Oligodendrocytes.
PG  - 495-522

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is the most common autosomal dominant inherited 
      ataxia worldwide, caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the Ataxin-3 gene resulting 
      in a polyglutamine (polyQ)-expansion in the corresponding protein. The disease is 
      characterized by neuropathological, phenotypical, and specific transcriptional 
      changes in affected brain regions. So far, there is no mouse model available 
      representing all the different aspects of the disease, yet highly needed for a 
      better understanding of the disease pathomechanisms. Here, we characterized a 
      novel Ataxin-3 knock-in mouse model, expressing a heterozygous or homozygous 
      expansion of 304 CAACAGs in the murine Ataxin-3 locus using biochemical, 
      behavioral, and transcriptomic approaches. We compared neuropathological, and 
      behavioral features of the new knock-in model with the in SCA3 research mostly 
      used YAC84Q mouse model. Further, we compared transcriptional changes found in 
      cerebellar samples of the SCA3 knock-in mice and post-mortem human SCA3 patients. 
      The novel knock-in mouse is characterized by the expression of a polyQ-expansion 
      in the murine Ataxin-3 protein, leading to aggregate formation, especially in 
      brain regions known to be vulnerable in SCA3 patients, and impairment of Purkinje 
      cells. Along these neuropathological changes, the mice showed a reduction in body 
      weight accompanied by gait and balance instability. Transcriptomic analysis of 
      cerebellar tissue revealed age-dependent differential expression, enriched for 
      genes attributed to myelinating oligodendrocytes. Comparing these changes with 
      those found in cerebellar tissue of SCA3 patients, we discovered an overlap of 
      differentially expressed genes pointing towards similar gene expression 
      perturbances in several genes linked to myelin sheaths and myelinating 
      oligodendrocytes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most common autosomal 
      dominant spinocerebellar ataxia worldwide. Almost all patients with SCA3 exhibit 
      nystagmus and/or saccades impairment. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence of 
      nystagmus as an early neurological manifestation, before ataxia, in some patients 
      with SCA3 in the first six months of the disease. METHODS: We evaluated a series 
      of 155 patients with clinically and molecularly proven SCA3 between 2013 and 
      2020. Data regarding sex, age, age at onset, disease duration, CAG repeat 
      expansion length, first symptom, presence of ataxia, scores on SARA and ICARS 
      scales, and presence and characteristics of nystagmus were collected. RESULTS: We 
      identified seven patients with symptomatic SCA3 who presented with isolated 
      nystagmus. In these seven individuals the age at onset ranged from 24 to 57 
      years, and disease duration from four to six months. CONCLUSIONS: Our study 
      showed that nystagmus may be the first neurological sign in SCA3. This clinical 
      observation reinforces the idea that the neurodegenerative process in SCA3 
      patients may start in vestibular system connections or in flocculonodular lobe. 
      This study adds relevant information about pre-symptomatic features in SCA3 that 
      may work as basis for a better understanding of brain degeneration and for future 
      therapeutic clinical trials.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease) is a 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by inheritance of a CAG repeat expansion within 
      the ATXN3 gene, resulting in polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion within the 
      ataxin-3 protein. In this study, we have identified protein aggregates in both 
      neuronal-like (SHSY5Y) cells and transgenic zebrafish expressing human ataxin-3 
      with expanded polyQ. We have adapted a previously reported flow cytometry 
      methodology named flow cytometric analysis of inclusions and trafficking, 
      allowing rapid quantification of detergent insoluble forms of ataxin-3 fused to a 
      GFP in SHSY5Y cells and cells dissociated from the zebrafish larvae. Flow 
      cytometric analysis revealed an increased number of detergent-insoluble ataxin-3 
      particles per nuclei in cells and in zebrafish expressing polyQ-expanded ataxin-3 
      compared to those expressing wild-type human ataxin-3. Treatment with compounds 
      known to modulate autophagic activity altered the number of detergent-insoluble 
      ataxin-3 particles in cells and zebrafish expressing mutant human ataxin-3. We 
      conclude that flow cytometry can be harnessed to rapidly count ataxin-3 
      aggregates, both in vitro and in vivo, and can be used to compare potential 
      therapies targeting protein aggregates. This article has an associated First 
      Person interview with the first author of the paper.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hereditary ataxias demonstrate a high degree of clinical and 
      genetic heterogeneity. Understanding the genetic etiology of hereditary ataxias 
      is crucial for genetic counseling and clinical management. METHODS: The clinical 
      and genetic data of patients with familial or sporadic ataxias who referred to 
      our tertiary medical center were retrospectively analyzed. Probands in this study 
      underwent SCA repeat expansion panel firstly to screen for repeat expansion SCAs; 
      those with negative results had NGS-targeted panels or WES testing to detect 
      conventional mutations. RESULTS: A total of 223 patients were enrolled from 206 
      families. 5 kinds of coexisting SCA repeat expansions were observed (SCA3/SCA17, 
      SCA3/SCA8, SCA2/SCA8, SCA3/SCA12 and SCA8/SCA12) in 12 patients from 8 families, 
      among which SCA2/SCA8, SCA8/SCA12 and SCA3/SCA12 were reported for the first 
      time. The coexistence of expanded SCA3 with SCA17 alleles was the most common in 
      our study. NGS identified pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 12 ataxia 
      causative genes in 13 probands. Spastic paraplegia ataxia was the most common 
      diagnosis. Six novel mutations were detected in five ataxia-related genes. 
      CONCLUSION: Coexistence may not specific to a certain SCA subtype and the 
      frequency might have been underestimated before. SCA repeat expansion panel 
      should be considered in patients with overlapping SCA features. In addition, our 
      study broadened the conventional mutation spectrum in ataxia-related genes. These 
      results facilitate a better understanding of the genetic basis for hereditary 
      ataxias.

      Phenotype.
PG  - 1906-1913
LID - 10.1007/s12031-021-01877-9 [doi]
AB  - Calpain-mediated proteolysis has been proposed to modulate the pathogenesis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), a 
      disorder due to a CAG repeat expansion (CAGexp) at ATXN3. We aimed to investigate 
      if single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at calpain gene CAPN2 and at 
      calpastatin gene CAST modulate the age at onset (AO) and disease progression in 
      SCA3/MJD. A total of 287 SCA3/MJD symptomatic subjects (151 families) were 
      included. AO was analyzed and controlled by the CAG repeat length of expanded 
      allele and family. Candidate polymorphisms were chosen based on the literature 
      and on a priori criteria. The CAG repeat length and SNPs were genotyped according 
      to standard methods. AO of carriers of AA and AG + GG(rs1559085) genotypes in 
      CAST and with the median value of 75 repeats at the expanded allele were 34.23 
      (33.07-35.38) and 36.42 years (34.50-38.34), respectively (p = 0.049, mixed model 
      treating the expanded CAG repeat size as fixed effect and family as random 
      effect). Carriers of haplotype C(rs27852)/G(rs1559085) had mean AO of 37.23 
      (12.76) and 33.42 years (12.20) (p = 0.047, Student's t test). Our data suggest 
      an association between allele G(rs1559085) and haplotype C(rs27852)/G(rs1559085) 
      at CAST and variations in the AO of SCA3/MJD subjects, independent from the 
      effects of the CAGexp and family. The present results support the potential role 
      of calpain cleavage pathway over modulation of SCA3/MJD phenotype.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
      heterozygous CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin 3 gene (ATXN3). However, patients 
      with homozygous SCA3 carrying expanded CAG repeats in both alleles of ATXN3 are 
      extremely rare. Herein, we present a case of a 50-year-old female who had 
      homozygous SCA3 with expansion of 62/62 repeats. Segregation analysis of the 
      patient's family showed both a contraction pattern of CAG repeat length and 
      stable transmission. The present case demonstrated an earlier onset and more 
      severe clinical phenotype than that seen in heterozygous individuals, suggesting 
      that the gene dosage enhances disease severity.

PG  - 1710-1728
LID - 10.1007/s13311-021-01075-w [doi]
AB  - CAG repeat expansion is the genetic cause of nine incurable polyglutamine (polyQ) 
      diseases with neurodegenerative features. Silencing repeat RNA holds great 
      therapeutic value. Here, we developed a repeat-based RNA-cleaving DNAzyme that 
      catalyzes the destruction of expanded CAG repeat RNA of six polyQ diseases with 
      high potency. DNAzyme preferentially cleaved the expanded allele in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) cells. While cleavage was 
      non-allele-specific for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) cells, treatment of 
      DNAzyme leads to improved cell viability without affecting mitochondrial 
      metabolism or p62-dependent aggresome formation. DNAzyme appears to be stable in 
      mouse brain for at least 1 month, and an intermediate dosage of DNAzyme in a SCA3 
      mouse model leads to a significant reduction of high molecular weight ATXN3 
      proteins. Our data suggest that DNAzyme is an effective RNA silencing molecule 
      for potential treatment of multiple polyQ diseases.

TI  - Molecular spectrum, family screening and genetic counselling of Spinocerebellar

PG  - 370-380
LID - 10.1080/01677063.2021.1940172 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA) is a heterogeneous adult-onset disorder with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance pattern mainly caused by triplet repeat 
      expansions. Clinical diagnosis of SCA is based on phenotypic features followed by 
      confirmation through molecular diagnosis. To identify status of repeat range in 
      Indian SCA cases and provide extended family screening, we enrolled 70 clinical 
      SCA suspects. For molecular diagnosis, multiplex PCR (M-PCR) was used for common 
      Indian SCA subtypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12 and 17. TP-PCR was further used in 
      SCA2, 7 and 10 to identify larger expansions. Eighteen out of 70 SCA suspects 
      (25%) were found to be positive for various SCA subtypes- (5 SCA1 (28%), 6 SAC2 
      (34%), 2 SCA3 (12%), 3 SCA7 (16%) and one each for SCA6 (1%) and SCA17 (1%) 
      subtypes). Genetic counselling and extended family screening were offered to all 
      positive cases and yielded additional nine cases. We have established M-PCR and 
      TP-PCR to detect the CAG repeat expansion in SCA suspects. This method can 
      confirm SCA subtypes in a reliable, rapid and cost-effective way. Genetic 
      characterization of SCA-related genes has great clinical relevance, as it could 
      provide additional information and guidance to clinicians and family members 
      regarding prognosis.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by CAG repeat expansion of the ATXN3 gene encoding ataxin-3 protein and is 
      mainly manifested by motor symptoms such as ataxia and non-motor symptoms such as 
      cognitive dysfunction. In this study, we obtained skin fibroblasts from a SCA3 
      patient and successfully constructed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using 
      the reprogramming plasmids expressing OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, LIN28, and L-MYC. The 
      generated iPSC line had a stable karyotype, expressed pluripotency markers, and 
      could differentiate into all three germ layers in vitro. In addition, the iPSC 
      line may be a useful model for identifying SCA3-related pathological mechanisms.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), 
      is a polyglutamine expansion disease arising from a trinucleotide CAG repeat 
      expansion in exon 10 of the gene ATXN3. There are no effective pharmacological 
      treatments for MJD, thus the identification of new pathogenic mechanisms, and the 
      development of novel therapeutics is urgently needed. In this study, we performed 
      a comprehensive, blind drug screen of 3942 compounds (many FDA approved) and 
      identified small molecules that rescued the motor-deficient phenotype in 
      transgenic ATXN3 Caenorhabditis elegans strain. Out of this screen, five lead 
      compounds restoring motility, protecting against neurodegeneration, and 
      increasing the lifespan in ATXN3-CAG89 mutant worms were identified. These 
      compounds were alfacalcidol, chenodiol, cyclophosphamide, fenbufen, and 
      sulfaphenazole. We then investigated how these molecules might exert their 
      neuroprotective properties. We found that three of these compounds, chenodiol, 
      fenbufen, and sulfaphenazole, act as modulators for TFEB/HLH-30, a key 
      transcriptional regulator of the autophagy process, and require this gene for 
      their neuroprotective activities. These genetic-chemical approaches, using 
      genetic C. elegans models for MJD and the screening, are promising tools to 
      understand the mechanisms and pathways causing neurodegeneration, leading to MJD. 
      Positively acting compounds may be promising candidates for investigation in 
      mammalian models of MJD and preclinical applications in the treatment of this 
      disease.

PG  - 117-125

AB  - PURPOSE: Investigate single nucleotide variants and short tandem repeats in 39 
      genes related to spinocerebellar ataxia in clinical and pathologically defined 
      cohorts of multiple system atrophy. METHODS: Exome sequencing was conducted in 28 
      clinical multiple system atrophy patients to identify single nucleotide variants 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes. Novel variants were validated in two 
      independent disease cohorts: 86 clinically diagnosed multiple system atrophy 
      patients and 166 pathological multiple system atrophy cases. Expanded repeat 
      alleles in spinocerebellar ataxia genes were evaluated in 36 clinically diagnosed 
      multiple system atrophy patients, and CAG/CAA repeats in TATA-Box Binding Protein 
      (TBP, causative of SCA17) were screened in 216 clinical and pathological multiple 
      system atrophy patients and 346 controls. RESULTS: No known pathogenic 
      spinocerebellar ataxia single nucleotide variants or pathogenic range expanded 
      repeat alleles of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, AXTN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, 
      and TBP were detected in any clinical multiple system atrophy patients. However, 
      four novel variants were identified in four spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes 
      across three multiple system atrophy patients. Additionally, four multiple system 
      atrophy patients (1.6%) and one control (0.3%) carried an intermediate length 41 
      TBP CAG/CAA repeat allele (OR = 4.11, P = 0.21). There was a significant 
      association between the occurrence of a repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) and an increased risk of multiple system atrophy (OR = 1.64, P = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: Occurrence of TBP CAG/CAA repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) is significantly associated with increased multiple system atrophy risk. 
      This discovery warrants further investigation and supports a possible genetic 
      overlap of multiple system atrophy with SCA17.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tandem repeats are highly mutable and contribute to the development 
      of human disease by a variety of mechanisms. It is difficult to predict which 
      tandem repeats may cause a disease. One hypothesis is that changeable tandem 
      repeats are the source of genetic diseases, because disease-causing repeats are 
      polymorphic in healthy individuals. However, it is not clear whether 
      disease-causing repeats are more polymorphic than other repeats. METHODS: We 
      performed a genome-wide survey of the millions of human tandem repeats using 
      publicly available long read genome sequencing data from 21 humans. We measured 
      tandem repeat copy number changes using tandem-genotypes. Length variation of 
      known disease-associated repeats was compared to other repeat loci. RESULTS: We 
      found that known Mendelian disease-causing or disease-associated repeats, 
      especially CAG and 5'UTR GGC repeats, are relatively long and polymorphic in the 
      general population. We also show that repeat lengths of two disease-causing 
      tandem repeats, in ATXN3 and GLS, are correlated with near-by GWAS SNP genotypes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We provide a catalog of polymorphic tandem repeats across a variety 
      of repeat unit lengths and sequences, from long read sequencing data. This method 
      especially if used in genome wide association study, may indicate possible new 
      candidates of pathogenic or biologically important tandem repeats in human 
      genomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Short tandem repeat (STR), or "microsatellite", is a tract of DNA in 
      which a specific motif (typically < 10 base pairs) is repeated multiple times. 
      STRs are abundant throughout the human genome, and specific repeat expansions may 
      be associated with human diseases. Long-read sequencing coupled with 
      bioinformatics tools enables the estimation of repeat counts for STRs. However, 
      with the exception of a few well-known disease-relevant STRs, normal ranges of 
      repeat counts for most STRs in human populations are not well known, preventing 
      the prioritization of STRs that may be associated with human diseases. RESULTS: 
      In this study, we extend a computational tool RepeatHMM to infer normal ranges of 
      432,604 STRs using 21 long-read sequencing datasets on human genomes, and build a 
      genomic-scale database called RepeatHMM-DB with normal repeat ranges for these 
      STRs. Evaluation on 13 well-known repeats show that the inferred repeat ranges 
      provide good estimation to repeat ranges reported in literature from 
      population-scale studies. This database, together with a repeat expansion 
      estimation tool such as RepeatHMM, enables genomic-scale scanning of repeat 
      regions in newly sequenced genomes to identify disease-relevant repeat 
      expansions. As a case study of using RepeatHMM-DB, we evaluate the CAG repeats of 
      ATXN3 for 20 patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) and 5 unaffected 
      individuals, and correctly classify each individual. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, 
      RepeatHMM-DB can facilitate prioritization and identification of disease-relevant 
      STRs from whole-genome long-read sequencing data on patients with undiagnosed 
      diseases. RepeatHMM-DB is incorporated into RepeatHMM and is available at 
      https://github.com/WGLab/RepeatHMM .

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene encoding the ataxin-3 protein. 
      Despite extensive research the exact pathogenic mechanisms of SCA3 are still not 
      understood in depth. In the present study, to gain insight into the toxicity 
      induced by the expanded CAG repeats in SCA3, we comprehensively investigated 
      repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation in various cellular models expressing 
      translated or non-canonically translated ATXN3 sequences with an increasing 
      number of CAG repeats. We demonstrate that two SCA3 RAN proteins, polyglutamine 
      (polyQ) and polyalanine (polyA), are found only in the case of CAG repeats of 
      pathogenic length. Despite having distinct cellular localization, RAN polyQ and 
      RAN polyA proteins are very often coexpressed in the same cell, impairing nuclear 
      integrity and inducing apoptosis. We provide for the first time mechanistic 
      insights into SCA3 RAN translation indicating that ATXN3 sequences surrounding 
      the repeat region have an impact on SCA3 RAN translation initiation and 
      efficiency. We revealed that RAN translation of polyQ proteins starts at 
      non-cognate codons upstream of the CAG repeats, whereas RAN polyA proteins are 
      likely translated within repeats. Furthermore, integrated stress response 
      activation enhances SCA3 RAN translation. Our findings suggest that the ATXN3 
      sequence context plays an important role in triggering SCA3 RAN translation and 
      that SCA3 RAN proteins may cause cellular toxicity.

TI  - Toward allele-specific targeting therapy and pharmacodynamic marker for 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.

LID - eabb7086
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the 
      ataxin-3 gene (ATXN3), is characterized by neuronal polyglutamine (polyQ) ATXN3 
      protein aggregates. Although there is no cure for SCA3, gene-silencing approaches 
      to reduce toxic polyQ ATXN3 showed promise in preclinical models. However, a 
      major limitation in translating putative treatments for this rare disease to the 
      clinic is the lack of pharmacodynamic markers for use in clinical trials. Here, 
      we developed an immunoassay that readily detects polyQ ATXN3 proteins in human 
      biological fluids and discriminates patients with SCA3 from healthy controls and 
      individuals with other ataxias. We show that polyQ ATXN3 serves as a marker of 
      target engagement in human fibroblasts, which may bode well for its use in 
      clinical trials. Last, we identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism that 
      strongly associates with the expanded allele, thus providing an exciting drug 
      target to abrogate detrimental events initiated by mutant ATXN3. Gene-silencing 
      strategies for several repeat diseases are well under way, and our results are 
      expected to improve clinical trial preparedness for SCA3 therapies.

      the expanded cytosine adenine guanine (CAG) repeat in ATXN3 is the causal 
      mutation, and its length is the main factor in determining the age at onset (AO) 
      of clinical symptoms. However, the contribution of the expanded CAG repeat length 
      to the rate of disease progression after onset has remained a matter of debate, 
      even though an understanding of this factor is crucial for experimental data on 
      disease modifiers and their translation to clinical trials and their design. 
      METHODS: Eighty-two Dutch patients with SCA3/MJD were evaluated annually for 
      15 years using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). Using 
      linear growth curve models, ICARS progression rates were calculated and tested 
      for their relation to the length of the CAG repeat expansion and to the residual 
      age at onset (RAO): The difference between the observed AO and the AO predicted 
      on the basis of the CAG repeat length. RESULTS: On average, ICARS scores 
      increased 2.57 points/year of disease. The length of the CAG repeat was 
      positively correlated with a more rapid ICARS progression, explaining 30% of the 
      differences between patients. Combining both the length of the CAG repeat and RAO 
      as comodifiers explained up to 47% of the interpatient variation in ICARS 
      progression. INTERPRETATION: Our data imply that the length of the expanded CAG 
      repeat in ATXN3 is a major determinant of clinical decline, which suggests that 
      CAG-dependent molecular mechanisms similar to those responsible for disease onset 
      also contribute to the rate of disease progression in SCA3/MJD. ANN NEUROL

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by CAG (encoding glutamine) repeat expansion in the Ataxin-3 
      (ATXN3) gene. We have shown previously that ATXN3-depleted or pathogenic 
      ATXN3-expressing cells abrogate polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP) 
      activity. Here, we report that ATXN3 associates with RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) 
      and the classical nonhomologous end-joining (C-NHEJ) proteins, including PNKP, 
      along with nascent RNAs under physiological conditions. Notably, ATXN3 depletion 
      significantly decreased global transcription, repair of transcribed genes, and 
      error-free double-strand break repair of a 3'-phosphate-containing terminally 
      gapped, linearized reporter plasmid. The missing sequence at the terminal break 
      site was restored in the recircularized plasmid in control cells by using the 
      endogenous homologous transcript as a template, indicating ATXN3's role in 
      PNKP-mediated error-free C-NHEJ. Furthermore, brain extracts from SCA3 patients 
      and mice show significantly lower PNKP activity, elevated p53BP1 level, more 
      abundant strand-breaks in the transcribed genes, and degradation of RNAP II 
      relative to controls. A similar RNAP II degradation is also evident in mutant 
      ATXN3-expressing Drosophila larval brains and eyes. Importantly, SCA3 phenotype 
      in Drosophila was completely amenable to PNKP complementation. Hence, salvaging 
      PNKP's activity can be a promising therapeutic strategy for SCA3.

AB  - Genetic testing for neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) is highly challenging 
      because of genetic heterogeneity and overlapping manifestations. Targeted-gene 
      panels (TGPs), coupled with next-generation sequencing (NGS), can facilitate the 
      profiling of a large repertoire of ND-related genes. Due to the technical 
      limitations inherent in NGS and TGPs, short tandem repeat (STR) variations are 
      often ignored. However, STR expansions are known to cause such NDs as 
      Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxias type 3 (SCA3). Here, we studied 
      the clinical utility of a custom-made TGP that targets 199 NDs and 311 
      ND-associated genes on 118 undiagnosed patients. At least one known or likely 
      pathogenic variation was found in 54 patients; 27 patients demonstrated clinical 
      profiles that matched the variants; and 16 patients whose original diagnosis were 
      refined. A high concordance of variant calling were observed when comparing the 
      results from TGP and whole-exome sequencing of four patients. Our in-house STR 
      detection algorithm has reached a specificity of 0.88 and a sensitivity of 0.82 
      in our SCA3 cohort. This study also uncovered a trove of novel and recurrent 
      variants that may enrich the repertoire of ND-related genetic markers. We propose 
      that a combined comprehensive TGPs-bioinformatics pipeline can improve the 
      clinical diagnosis of NDs.

TI  - Druggable genome screen identifies new regulators of the abundance and toxicity 
      of ATXN3, the Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 3 disease protein.

AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 3 (SCA3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease) is a 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion encoding an 
      abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the disease protein, ataxin-3 
      (ATXN3). No preventive treatment is yet available for SCA3. Because SCA3 is 
      likely caused by a toxic gain of ATXN3 function, a rational therapeutic strategy 
      is to reduce mutant ATXN3 levels by targeting pathways that control its 
      production or stability. Here, we sought to identify genes that modulate ATXN3 
      levels as potential therapeutic targets in this fatal disorder. We screened a 
      collection of siRNAs targeting 2742 druggable human genes using a cell-based 
      assay based on luminescence readout of polyQ-expanded ATXN3. From 317 candidate 
      genes identified in the primary screen, 100 genes were selected for validation. 
      Among the 33 genes confirmed in secondary assays, 15 were validated in an 
      independent cell model as modulators of pathogenic ATXN3 protein levels. Ten of 
      these genes were then assessed in a Drosophila model of SCA3, and one was 
      confirmed as a key modulator of physiological ATXN3 abundance in SCA3 neuronal 
      progenitor cells. Among the 15 genes shown to modulate ATXN3 in mammalian cells, 
      orthologs of CHD4, FBXL3, HR and MC3R regulate mutant ATXN3-mediated toxicity in 
      fly eyes. Further mechanistic studies of one of these genes, FBXL3, encoding a 
      F-box protein that is a component of the SKP1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase 
      complex, showed that it reduces levels of normal and pathogenic ATXN3 in SCA3 
      neuronal progenitor cells, primarily via a SCF complex-dependent manner. 
      Bioinformatic analysis of the 15 genes revealed a potential molecular network 
      with connections to tumor necrosis factor-alpha/nuclear factor-kappa B (TNF/NF-kB) 
      and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathways. Overall, we 
      identified 15 druggable genes with diverse functions to be suppressors or 
      enhancers of pathogenic ATXN3 abundance. Among identified pathways highlighted by 
      this screen, the FBXL3/SCF axis represents a novel molecular pathway that 
      regulates physiological levels of ATXN3 protein.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion within the ATXN3/MJD1 gene. The 
      expanded CAG repeats encode a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract at the C-terminus of 
      the ATXN3 protein. ATXN3 containing expanded polyQ forms aggregates, leading to 
      subsequent cellular dysfunctions including an impaired ubiquitin-proteasome 
      system (UPS). To investigate the pathogenesis of SCA3 and develop potential 
      therapeutic strategies, we established induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines 
      from SCA3 patients (SCA3-iPSC). Neurons derived from SCA3-iPSCs formed aggregates 
      that are positive to the polyQ marker 1C2. Treatment with the proteasome 
      inhibitor, MG132, on SCA3-iPSC-derived neurons downregulated proteasome activity, 
      increased production of radical oxygen species (ROS), and upregulated the cleaved 
      caspase 3 level and caspase 3 activity. This increased susceptibility to the 
      proteasome inhibitor can be rescued by a Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) extract 
      NH037 (from Pueraria lobata) and its constituent daidzein via upregulating 
      proteasome activity and reducing protein ubiquitination, oxidative stress, 
      cleaved caspase 3 level, and caspase 3 activity. Our results successfully 
      recapitulate the key phenotypes of the neurons derived from SCA3 patients, as 
      well as indicate the potential of NH037 and daidzein in the treatment for SCA3 
      patients.

AB  - Background: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is 
      one of the nine polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases and is caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion within the coding sequence of the ATXN3 gene. Few multimodal imaging 
      analyses of the macro- and micro-structural changes have been performed. Methods: 
      In the present study, we recruited 31 genetically-confirmed symptomatic SCA3/MJD 
      patients and 31 healthy subjects as controls for a multimodal neuroimaging study 
      using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), proton magnetic resonance 
      spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Results: The SCA3/MJD 
      patients displayed a significantly reduced of gray matter volume in the 
      cerebellum, pons, midbrain and medulla, as well as inferior frontal gyrus and 
      insula, and left superior frontal gyrus. The total International Cooperative 
      Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) score was inversely correlated with the gray matter 
      volume in the cerebellar culmen, pons and midbrain. The numbers of CAG repeats in 
      the expanded alleles were inversely correlated with the gray matter in the 
      cerebellar culmen. NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho ratio in the middle cerebellar peduncles, 
      dentate nucleus, cerebellar vermis, and thalamus in the SCA3/MJD patients were 
      significantly reduced when compared to that in the normal controls, suggesting 
      neurochemical alterations in cerebellum in the SCA3/MJD patients. Tract-Based 
      Spatial Statistics (TBSS) analysis revealed significant lower volume and mean FA 
      values of the cerebellar peduncles, which inversely correlated with the total 
      scores of ICARS in our patients. Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrated 
      cerebellar degeneration in SCA3/MJD based on tissue volume, neurochemistry, and 
      tissue microstructure. Moreover, the associations between the clinical measures, 
      cerebellar degeneration and genetic variation support a distinct 
      genotype-phenotype relationship in SCA3/MJD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dystonia is a relatively common feature of spinocerebellar ataxia 3 
      (SCA3). Childhood onset of SCA3 is rare and typically associated with either 
      relatively large, or homozygous, CAG repeat expansions. CASE REPORT: We describe 
      a 10-year-old girl with SCA3, who presented with tongue dystonia in addition to 
      limb dystonia and gait ataxia due to a heterozygous expansion of 84 repeats in 
      ATXN3. DISCUSSION: Diagnosis of the SCAs can be challenging, and even more so in 
      children. Tongue dystonia has not previously been documented in SCA3.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) and type 1 (SCA1) are dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative disorders that are currently incurable. Both diseases are 
      caused by a CAG-repeat expansion in exon 10 of the Ataxin-3 and exon 8 of the 
      Ataxin-1 gene, respectively, encoding an elongated polyglutamine tract that 
      confers toxic properties to the resulting proteins. We have previously shown 
      lowering of the pathogenic polyglutamine protein in Huntington's disease mouse 
      models using (CUG)7, a CAG repeat-targeting antisense oligonucleotide. Here we 
      evaluated the therapeutic capacity of (CUG)7 for SCA3 and SCA1, in vitro in 
      patient-derived cell lines and in vivo in representative mouse models. Repeated 
      intracerebroventricular (CUG)7 administration resulted in a significant reduction 
      of mutant Ataxin-3 and Ataxin-1 proteins throughout the brain of SCA3 and SCA1 
      mouse models, respectively. Furthermore, in both a SCA3 patient cell line and the 
      MJD84.2 mouse model, (CUG)7 induced formation of a truncated Ataxin-3 protein 
      species lacking the polyglutamine stretch, likely arising from (CUG)7-mediated 
      exon 10 skipping. In contrast, skipping of exon 8 of Ataxin-1 did not 
      significantly contribute to the Ataxin-1 protein reduction observed in 
      (CUG)7-treated SCA1(154Q/2Q) mice. These findings support the therapeutic 
      potential of a single CAG repeat-targeting AON for the treatment of multiple 
      polyglutamine disorders.

      spinal cord, and substantia nigra. Here we report the first NIH-approved human 
      embryonic stem cell (hESC) line derived from an embryo harboring the SCA3 
      mutation. Referred to as SCA3-hESC, this line is heterozygous for the mutant 
      polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. We observed 
      relevant molecular hallmarks of the human disease at all differentiation stages 
      from stem cells to cortical neurons, including robust ATXN3 aggregation and 
      altered expression of key components of the protein quality control machinery. In 
      addition, SCA3-hESCs exhibit nuclear accumulation of mutant ATXN3 and form 
      p62-positive aggresomes. Finally, antisense oligonucleotide-mediated reduction of 
      ATXN3 markedly suppressed aggresome formation. The SCA3-hESC line offers a unique 
      and highly relevant human disease model that holds strong potential to advance 
      understanding of SCA3 disease mechanisms and facilitate the evaluation of 
      candidate therapies for SCA3.

AB  - The most commonly inherited dominant ataxia, Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 
      (SCA3), is caused by a CAG repeat expansion that encodes an abnormally long 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat in the disease protein ataxin-3, a deubiquitinase. 
      Two major full-length isoforms of ataxin-3 exist, both of which contain the same 
      N-terminal portion and polyQ repeat, but differ in their C-termini; one (denoted 
      here as isoform 1) contains a motif that binds ataxin-3's substrate, ubiquitin, 
      whereas the other (denoted here as isoform 2) has a hydrophobic tail. Most SCA3 
      studies have focused on isoform 1, the predominant version in mammalian brain, 
      yet both isoforms are present in brain and a better understanding of their 
      relative pathogenicity in vivo is needed. We took advantage of the fruit fly, 
      Drosophila melanogaster to model SCA3 and to examine the toxicity of each 
      ataxin-3 isoform. Our assays reveal isoform 1 to be markedly more toxic than 
      isoform 2 in all fly tissues. Reduced toxicity from isoform 2 is due to much 
      lower protein levels as a result of its expedited degradation. Additional studies 
      indicate that isoform 1 is more aggregation-prone than isoform 2 and that the 
      C-terminus of isoform 2 is critical for its enhanced proteasomal degradation. 
      According to our results, although both full-length, pathogenic ataxin-3 isoforms 
      are toxic, isoform 1 is likely the primary contributor to SCA3 due to its 
      presence at higher levels. Isoform 2, as a result of rapid degradation that is 
      dictated by its tail, is unlikely to be a key player in this disease. Our 
      findings provide new insight into the biology of this ataxia and the cellular 
      processing of the underlying disease protein.

AB  - Genomic technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) are revolutionizing 
      molecular diagnostics and clinical medicine. However, these approaches have 
      proven inefficient at identifying pathogenic repeat expansions. Here, we apply a 
      collection of bioinformatics tools that can be utilized to identify either known 
      or novel expanded repeat sequences in NGS data. We performed genetic studies of a 
      cohort of 35 individuals from 22 families with a clinical diagnosis of cerebellar 
      ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). 
      Analysis of whole-genome sequence (WGS) data with five independent algorithms 
      identified a recessively inherited intronic repeat expansion [(AAGGG)(exp)] in 
      the gene encoding Replication Factor C1 (RFC1). This motif, not reported in the 
      reference sequence, localized to an Alu element and replaced the reference 
      (AAAAG)(11) short tandem repeat. Genetic analyses confirmed the pathogenic 
      expansion in 18 of 22 CANVAS-affected families and identified a core ancestral 
      haplotype, estimated to have arisen in Europe more than twenty-five thousand 
      years ago. WGS of the four RFC1-negative CANVAS-affected families identified 
      plausible variants in three, with genomic re-diagnosis of SCA3, spastic ataxia of 
      the Charlevoix-Saguenay type, and SCA45. This study identified the genetic basis 
      of CANVAS and demonstrated that these improved bioinformatics tools increase the 
      diagnostic utility of WGS to determine the genetic basis of a heterogeneous group 
      of clinically overlapping neurogenetic disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of more than one polyQ-related gene within a single 
      individual is a rare incidence, which may provide the potential opportunity to 
      study the combined effects of these spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) genes. METHODS: 
      We retrospectively analyzed genetic data from 112 SCA3 probands and found Patient 
      1 harbored expanded ATXN2 allele (33 repeats) and intermediate TBP allele (41 
      repeats), and Patient 2 with intermediate ATXN2 allele (32 repeats). Detailed 
      clinical and oculomotor performances were investigated. The age at onset and 
      oculomotor parameters of both patients were compared with matched pure SCA3 
      groups controlling either disease severity or CAG repeats. RESULTS: Most of the 
      clinical phenotypes and oculomotor characteristics of these two patients were 
      common to typical SCA3 patients. Compared to pure SCA3 groups controlling disease 
      severity, mild reduced horizontal saccade velocity could be detected in both 
      patients. However, mild expansions of the ATXN2 allele seemed to have no 
      influence on the age at onset of Patient 1 but might have a mild impact on 
      Patient 2. CONCLUSION: Our study provides supporting evidence that mild 
      expansions of ATXN2 may have modifying effects on SCA3 phenotype. Larger control 
      series and longitudinal data are warranted to confirm our results.

AB  - At least 40 human diseases are associated with repeat expansions; yet, the 
      mutational origin and instability mechanisms remain unknown for most of them. 
      Previously, genetic epidemiology and predisposing backgrounds for the instability 
      of some expanding loci have been studied in different populations through the 
      analysis of diversity flanking the respective pathogenic repeats. Here, we aimed 
      at developing a pipeline to assess disease-associated haplotypes at 
      oligonucleotide repeat loci, combining analysis of single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) and short tandem repeats (STRs). Machado-Joseph disease 
      (MJD/SCA3), the most frequent dominant ataxia worldwide, was used as an example 
      of a detailed procedure. Thus, to identify genetic backgrounds that segregate 
      with expanded/mutated alleles in MJD, we selected a set of 26 SNPs and 7 STRs 
      flanking the causative CAG repeat. Key criteria and steps for this selection are 
      described, and included (1) haplotype blocks minimizing the occurrence of 
      recombination (for SNPs); and (2) match scores to increase potential for 
      polymorphic information content of repetitive sequences found in Tandem Repeats 
      Finder (for STRs). To directly assess SNP haplotypes in phase with MJD 
      expansions, we optimized a strategy with preferential amplification of normal 
      over expanded alleles, in addition to SNP allele-specific amplifications; this 
      allowed the identification of disease-associated SNP haplotypes, even when only 
      the proband is available in a given family. To infer STR haplotypes, we optimized 
      a multiplex PCR, including 7 STRs plus the MJD_CAG repeat, followed by analysis 
      of segregation or the use of the PHASE software. This protocol is a ready-to-use 
      tool to assess MJD haplotypes in different populations. The pipeline designed can 
      be used to assess disease-associated haplotypes in other repeat-expansion 
      diseases. This should be of great utility to study (1) genetic epidemiology 
      (population-of-origin, age and spreading routes of mutations) and (2) mechanisms 
      responsible for de novo expansions, in these neurological diseases; (3) to detect 
      predisposing haplotypes and (4) phenotype modifiers; (5) to help solving cases of 
      apparent homoallelism (two same-size normal alleles) in diagnosis; and (6) to 
      identify the best targets for the development of allele-specific therapies in 
      ethnically diverse patient populations.

TI  - FipoQ/FBXO33, a Cullin-1-based ubiquitin ligase complex component modulates 
      ubiquitination and solubility of polyglutamine disease protein.
PG  - 781-798
LID - 10.1111/jnc.14669 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases describe a group of progressive neurodegenerative 
      disorders caused by the CAG triplet repeat expansion in the coding region of the 
      disease genes. To date, nine such diseases, including spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3 (SCA3), have been reported. The formation of SDS-insoluble protein aggregates 
      in neurons causes cellular dysfunctions, such as impairment of the 
      ubiquitin-proteasome system, and contributes to polyQ pathologies. Recently, the 
      E3 ubiquitin ligases, which govern substrate specificity of the 
      ubiquitin-proteasome system, have been implicated in polyQ pathogenesis. The 
      Cullin (Cul) proteins are major components of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases 
      (CRLs) complexes that are evolutionarily conserved in the Drosophila genome. In 
      this study, we examined the effect of individual Culs on SCA3 pathogenesis and 
      found that the knockdown of Cul1 expression enhances SCA3-induced 
      neurodegeneration and reduces the solubility of expanded SCA3-polyQ proteins. The 
      F-box proteins are substrate receptors of Cul1-based CRL. We further performed a 
      genetic modifier screen of the 19 Drosophila F-box genes and identified F-box 
      involved in polyQ pathogenesis (FipoQ) as a genetic modifier of SCA3 degeneration 
      that modulates the ubiquitination and solubility of expanded SCA3-polyQ proteins. 
      In the human SK-N-MC cell model, we identified that F-box only protein 33 
      (FBXO33) exerts similar functions as FipoQ in modulating the ubiquitination and 
      solubility of expanded SCA3-polyQ proteins. Taken together, our study 
      demonstrates that Cul1-based CRL and its associated F-box protein, FipoQ/FBXO33, 
      modify SCA3 protein toxicity. These findings will lead to a better understanding 
      of the disease mechanism of SCA3 and provide insights for developing treatments 
      against SCA3. Cover Image for this issue: doi: 10.1111/jnc.14510.

AB  - DNA methylation has been reported as an important regulator of genomic structure 
      stability, including large tandem repeats. To test the modulation effect of 
      variants in DNA methylation-related genes on distribution of expanded (CAG)(n) 
      alleles and age at onset (AO) of patients with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), we 
      conducted an association analysis on 23 selected SNPs in these genes in 613 
      patients with MJD and 581 controls. There were significant differences in the 
      distribution of rs12957023 between patients and controls (OR = 1.296, p = 0.007 
      and OR = 1.206, p = 0.008, for genotype and alleles, respectively). The 
      distribution of (CAG)(n) size was also different between patients carrying a CC 
      and the other genotypes (TT and TC, p = 0.011 for expanded (CAG)(n) and p = 0.012 
      for normal size alleles), indicating that DNA methylation might modulate the 
      (CAG)(n) instability. We found also that rs13420827 in DNMT3A and rs7354779 in 
      DNMT3L contribute to AO of MJD (p = 0.019 and p = 0.008, respectively). In 
      conclusion, our data provide the first evidence that SNPs in DNA 
      methylation-related genes may contribute to (CAG)(n) instability and modulate the 
      AO of this disease.

      been proposed to explain the pathogenic role of mutant, polyQ-expanded ATXN3 in 
      SCA3 including disease protein aggregation, impairment of ubiquitin-proteasomal 
      degradation and transcriptional dysregulation. A better understanding of the 
      normal functions of this protein may shed light on SCA3 disease pathogenesis. To 
      assess the potential normal role of ATXN3 in regulating gene expression, we 
      compared transcriptional profiles in WT versus Atxn3 null mouse embryonic 
      fibroblasts. Differentially expressed genes in the absence of ATXN3 contribute to 
      multiple signal transduction pathways, suggesting a status switch of signaling 
      pathways including depressed Wnt and BMP4 pathways and elevated growth factor 
      pathways such as Prolactin, TGF-beta, and Ephrin pathways. The Eph receptor A3 
      (Efna3), a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase in the Ephrin pathway that is highly 
      expressed in the nervous system, was the most differentially upregulated gene in 
      Atxn3 null MEFs. This increased expression of Efna3 was recapitulated in Atxn3 
      knockout mouse brainstem, a selectively vulnerable brain region in SCA3. 
      Overexpression of normal or expanded ATXN3 was sufficient to repress Efna3 
      expression, supporting a role for ATXN3 in regulating Ephrin signaling. We 
      further show that, in the absence of ATXN3, Efna3 upregulation is associated with 
      hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the Efna3 promoter, which in turn is 
      induced by decreased levels of HDAC3 and NCoR in ATXN3 null cells. Together, 
      these results reveal a normal role for ATXN3 in transcriptional regulation of 
      multiple signaling pathways of potential relevance to disease processes in SCA3.

TI  - Age at onset prediction in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 changes according to

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease 
      (SCA3/MJD), the length of CAG repeat expansions in ATXN3 shows an inverse 
      correlation with age at onset (AO). Recently, a formula for predicting AO based 
      on CAG expansion was developed for European carriers. We tested this formula in 
      SCA3/MJD carriers from distinct origins and developed population-specific models 
      to predict AO. METHODS: This was a parametric survival modelling study. RESULTS: 
      The European formula (EF) was tested in 739 independent SCA3/MJD carriers from 
      South Brazil, Taiwan and the Portuguese Azorean islands, and it largely 
      underestimated AO in South Brazilian and Taiwanese test cohorts. This finding 
      challenged the universal use of the EF, leading us to develop and validate 
      population-specific models for AO prediction. Using validation cohorts, we showed 
      that Brazilian and Taiwanese formulas largely outperformed the EF in a 
      population-specific manner. Inversely, the EF was more accurate at predicting AO 
      among Portuguese Azorean patients. Hence, specific prediction models were 
      required for each SCA3/MJD ethnic group. CONCLUSIONS: Our data strongly support 
      the existence of as yet unknown factors that modulate AO in SCA3/MJD in a 
      population-dependent manner, independent of CAG expansion length. The generated 
      models are made available to the scientific community as they can be useful for 
      future studies on SCA3/MJD carriers from distinct geographical origins.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To study the long-term evolution of patient-reported outcome 
      measures (PROMs) in the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), we analyzed 
      8 years follow-up data of the EUROSCA Natural History Study, a cohort study of 
      526 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6. METHODS: To assess the functional 
      capacity in daily living, we used the functional assessment (part IV) of the 
      Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS-IV), for health-related quality 
      of life the visual analogue scale of the EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire 
      (EQ-5D VAS), and for depressive symptoms the Patient Health Questionnaire 
      (PHQ-9). Severity of ataxia was assessed using the Scale for the Assessment and 
      Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and neurological symptoms other than ataxia with the 
      Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS). RESULTS: UHDRS-IV [SCA1: - 1.35 (0.12); 
      SCA2: - 1.15 (0.11); SCA3: - 1.16 (0.11); SCA6: - 0.99 (0.12)] and EQ-5D [SCA1: 
      - 2.88 (0.72); SCA2: - 1.97 (0.49); SCA3: - 2.06 (0.55); SCA6: - 1.03 (0.57)] 
      decreased linearly, whereas PHQ-9 increased [SCA1: 0.15 (0.04); SCA2: 0.09 
      (0.03); SCA3: 0.06 (0.04); SCA6: 0.07 (0.04)] during the observational period. 
      Standard response means (SRMs) of UHDRS-IV (0.473-0.707) and EQ-5D VAS 
      (0.053-0.184) were lower than that of SARA (0.404-0.979). In SCA1, higher SARA 
      scores [- 0.0288 (0.01), p = 0.0251], longer repeat expansions [- 0.0622 (0.02), 
      p = 0.0002] and the presence of cognitive impairment at baseline [- 0.5381 
      (0.25), p = 0.0365] were associated with faster UHDRS-IV decline. In SCA3, higher 
      INAS counts were associated with a faster UHDRS-IV decline [- 0.05 (0.02), 
      p = 0.0212]. In SCA1, PHQ-9 progression was faster in patients with cognitive 
      impairment [0.14 (0.07); p = 0.0396]. CONCLUSIONS: In the common SCAs, PROMs give 
      complementary information to the information provided by neurological scales. 
      This underlines the importance of PROMs as additional outcome measures in future 
      interventional trials.

AB  - A skin biopsy of a patient with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3, also known 
      as Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)) caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      in the ATXN3 gene, was used to generate an induced pluripotent stem cell line, 
      HIHCNi002-A (iPSC-SCA3). Skin fibroblasts were reprogrammed using episomal 
      plasmids carrying hOCT4, hSOX2, hKLF4, hL-MYC, and hLIN28. The iPSC-SCA3 line 
      exhibits chromosomal stability with conservation of the ATXN3 repeat expansion, 
      expresses pluripotency markers and differentiates into endo-, meso-, and 
      ectodermal cells in vitro.

TI  - Olfactory Function in SCA10.
PG  - 85-90
LID - 10.1007/s12311-018-0954-1 [doi]
AB  - Although the main clinical manifestations of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) 
      result from damage of the cerebellum, other systems may also be involved. 
      Olfactory deficits have been reported in other types of ataxias, especially in 
      SCA3; however, there are no studies on olfactory deficits in SCA type 10 (SCA10). 
      To analyze olfactory function of SCA10 patients compared with that of SCA3, 
      Parkinson's, and healthy controls. Olfactory identification was tested in three 
      groups of 30 patients (SCA10, SCA3, and Parkinson's disease (PD)) and 44 healthy 
      controls using the Sniffin' Sticks (SS16) test. Mean SS16 score was 11.9 +/- 2.9 
      for the SCA10 group, 12.3 +/- 1.9 for the SCA3 group, 6.6 +/- 2.8 for the PD group, 
      and 12.1 +/- 2.0 for the control group. Mean SS16 score for the SCA10 group was not 
      significantly different from the scores for the SCA3 and control groups but was 
      significantly higher than the score for the PD group (p < 0.001) when adjusted 
      for age, gender, and history of smoking. There was no association between SS16 
      scores and disease duration in the SCA10 or SCA3 groups or number of repeat 
      expansions. SS16 and Mini Mental State Examination scores were correlated in the 
      three groups: SCA10 group (r = 0.59, p = 0.001), SCA3 group (r = 0.50, 
      p = 0.005), and control group (r = 0.40, p = 0.007). We found no significant 
      olfactory deficits in SCA10 in this large series.

TI  - Tissue-Specific Upregulation of Drosophila Insulin Receptor (InR) Mitigates 
      Poly(Q)-Mediated Neurotoxicity by Restoration of Cellular Transcription 
      Machinery.
PG  - 1310-1329
LID - 10.1007/s12035-018-1160-3 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine [poly(Q)] disorders are a class of trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      neurodegenerative disorders which are dominantly inherited and progressively 
      acquired with age. This group of disorders entail the characteristic formation of 
      protein aggregates leading to widespread loss of neurons in different regions of 
      the brain. SCA3 and HD, the two most commonly occurring types of poly(Q) 
      disorders were examined in the present study. With the aim of elucidating novel 
      genetic modifiers of poly(Q) disorders, the Drosophila insulin receptor (InR) was 
      identified as a potential suppressor of poly(Q)-induced neurotoxicity and 
      degeneration. We demonstrate for the first time that targeted upregulation of InR 
      could effectively mitigate poly(Q)-mediated neurodegeneration in fly models. A 
      significant reduction in poly(Q)-mediated cellular stress and apoptosis was noted 
      upon InR overexpression in poly(Q) background. We further reveal that targeted 
      upregulation of InR causes a substantial reduction in poly(Q) aggregate formation 
      with the residual inclusion bodies localised to the cytoplasm. We also 
      demonstrate that InR achieves suppression of poly(Q) toxicity by replenishing the 
      cellular pool of CREB binding protein and improving the histone acetylation 
      status of the cell. This leads to restoration of the cellular transcriptional 
      machinery which is otherwise severely compromised in poly(Q) disease conditions. 
      Interestingly, there also appeared a possibility of autophagy-mediated rescue of 
      poly(Q) phenotype due to upregulation of InR. Therefore, our study strongly 
      suggests that modulation of the insulin signalling pathway could be an effective 
      therapeutic intervention against poly(Q) disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most common subtype of 
      SCAs worldwide. SCA3 homozygote is defined as expanded CAG repeats in both 
      alleles that might exhibit severe phenotype due to gene dosage effect. However, a 
      study on the systematic comparison of clinical phenotypes between homozygotes and 
      heterozygotes to indicate these verity of phenotypes of homozygotes is still 
      lacking. METHODS: A total of 14 SCA3 homozygotes (3 Chinese participants and 11 
      participants from various ethnicity in different published studies) and 143 
      Chinese heterozygotes of SCA3 were recruited for this study. The 95% confidence 
      intervals (CIs) of age at onset and disease severity expected from heterozygous 
      patients were analyzed to detect the phenotypic differences between homozygotes 
      and heterozygotes. RESULTS: Almost all the homozygotes (13 of 14) were found to 
      present a significant earlier age at onset compared with heterozygotes, because 
      age at onset of most homozygotes was lower than the 95% CIs of age at onset of 
      heterozygotes. Also, the clinical severity in most of the homozygotes (3 of 4) 
      with identified clinical phenotypes was higher than the 95% CIs of severity in 
      heterozygotes, indicating more severe clinical phenotypes in SCA3 homozygotes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The homozygosity for SCA3 could lead to an earlier age of onset and 
      putative severe clinical features. The findings of the present study suggested an 
      influence of gene dosage on SCA3 phenotypes.

TI  - Serum neurofilament light is increased in multiple system atrophy of cerebellar 
      type and in repeat-expansion spinocerebellar ataxias: a pilot study.
PG  - 1618-1624
LID - 10.1007/s00415-018-8893-9 [doi]
AB  - Blood biomarkers in degenerative ataxias are still largely missing. Here, we 
      aimed to provide piloting proof-of-concept that serum Neurofilament light (NfL) 
      could offer a promising peripheral blood biomarker in degenerative ataxias. 
      Specifically, as a marker of neuronal damage, NfL might (1) help to differentiate 
      multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type (MSA-C) from sporadic adult-onset 
      ataxia (SAOA), and (2) show increases in repeat-expansion spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs) which might be amenable to treatment in the future. To explore these two 
      hypotheses, we measured serum NfL levels by single-molecule array (Simoa) 
      technique in 115 subjects, comprising patients with MSA-C (n = 25), SAOA 
      (n = 25), the most frequent repeat-expansion SCAs (SCA 1, 2, 3 and 6) (n = 20), 
      and age-matched controls (n = 45). Compared to controls, NfL was significantly 
      increased in MSA-C, with levels significantly higher than in SAOA (AUC = 0.74 
      (0.59-0.89), mean and 95% confidence interval, p = .004). NfL was also 
      significantly increased in SCA patients as compared to controls (AUC = 0.91 
      (0.81-1.00), p < .001), including NfL increases in SCA1 and SCA3. These findings 
      provide first proof-of-concept that NfL might provide a promising peripheral 
      biomarker in degenerative ataxias, e.g. supporting the differentiation of MSA-C 
      from SAOA, and indicating neuronal damage in repeat-expansion SCAs.

TI  - Genetic testing for clinically suspected spinocerebellar ataxias: report from a 
      tertiary referral centre in India.
PG  - 219-224
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      syndromes, characterized by a wide range of muscular weakness and motor deficits, 
      caused due to cerebellar degeneration. The prevalence of the syndromes of SCA 
      varies across the world and is known to be linked to the instability of 
      trinucleotide repeats within the high-end normal alleles, along with susceptible 
      haplotype. We estimated sizes of the CAG or GAA repeat expansions at the SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA12 and frataxin loci among 864 referrals of subjects to genetic 
      counselling and testing (GCAT) clinic, National Institute of Mental Health and 
      Neurosciences, Bengaluru, India, with suspected SCA. The most frequent mutations 
      detected were SCA1 (n = 100 (11.6%)) and SCA2 (n = 98 (11.3%)) followed by SCA3 
      (n = 40 (4.6%)), FRDA (n = 20 (2.3%)) and SCA12 (n = 8 (0.9%)).

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the region of the ATXN3 gene. The 
      main feature of SCA3 is progressive ataxia, which affects balance, gait, and 
      speech. Urine cells (UCs) of a SCA3 patient were successfully translated to 
      induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by using the Sendai virus delivery system. 
      ZZUi004-A cell line may provide a robust platform for further study of SCA3 
      pathogenesis as well as drug testing and gene therapy research.

AB  - Cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansions in the coding regions of nine 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) genes (HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATN1, AR, 
      and TBP) are the cause of several neurodegenerative diseases including 
      Huntington's disease (HD), six different spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. The 
      expanded CAG repeat length in the causative gene is negatively related to the 
      age-at-onset (AAO) of clinical symptoms. In addition to the expanded CAG repeat 
      length in the causative gene, the normal CAG repeats in the other polyQ genes can 
      affect the AAO, suggesting functional interactions between the polyQ genes. 
      However, there is no detailed assessment of the relationships among polyQ genes 
      in pathologically relevant brain regions. We used gene co-expression analysis to 
      study the functional relationships among polyQ genes in different brain regions 
      using the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), a spatial map of gene expression in the 
      healthy brain. We constructed co-expression networks for seven anatomical brain 
      structures, as well as a region showing a specific pattern of atrophy in HD 
      patients detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. In this 
      HD-associated region, we found that ATN1 and ATXN2 were co-expressed and shared 
      co-expression partners which were enriched for DNA repair genes. We observed a 
      similar co-expression pattern in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and striatum in 
      which this relation was most pronounced. Given that the co-expression patterns 
      for these anatomical structures were similar to those for the HD-associated 
      region, our results suggest that their disruption is likely involved in HD 
      pathology. Moreover, ATN1 and ATXN2 also shared many co-expressed genes with HTT, 
      the causative gene of HD, across the brain. Although this triangular relationship 
      among these three polyQ genes may also be dysregulated in other polyQ diseases, 
      stronger co-expression patterns between ATN1 and ATXN2 observed in the 
      HD-associated region, especially in the striatum, may be more specific to HD.

PG  - 492

LID - 492
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postural tremor can sometimes occur in spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs). However, the prevalence and clinical characteristics of postural tremor 
      in SCAs are poorly understood, and whether SCA patients with postural tremor have 
      different ataxia progression is not known. METHODS: We studied postural tremor in 
      315 patients with SCA1, 2, 3, and 6 recruited from the Clinical Research 
      Consortium for Spinocerebellar Ataxias (CRC-SCA), which consists of 12 
      participating centers in the United States, and we evaluated ataxia progression 
      in these patients from January 2010 to August 2012. RESULTS: Among 315 SCA 
      patients, postural tremor was most common in SCA2 patients (SCA1, 5.8%; SCA2, 
      27.5%; SCA3, 12.4%; SCA6, 16.9%; p = 0.007). SCA3 patients with postural tremor 
      had longer CAG repeat expansions than SCA3 patients without postural tremor 
      (73.67 +/- 3.12 vs. 70.42 +/- 3.96, p = 0.003). Interestingly, SCA1 and SCA6 patients 
      with postural tremor had a slower rate of ataxia progression (SCA1, beta = -0.91, p 
      < 0.001; SCA6, beta = -1.28, p = 0.025), while SCA2 patients with postural tremor 
      had a faster rate of ataxia progression (beta = 1.54, p = 0.034). We also found that 
      the presence of postural tremor in SCA2 patients could be influenced by repeat 
      expansions of ATXN1 (beta = -1.53, p = 0.037) and ATXN3 (beta = 0.57, p = 0.018), 
      whereas postural tremor in SCA3 was associated with repeat lengths in TBP (beta = 
      0.63, p = 0.041) and PPP2R2B (beta = -0.40, p = 0.032). DISCUSSION: Postural tremor 
      could be a clinical feature of SCAs, and the presence of postural tremor could be 
      associated with different rates of ataxia progression. Genetic interactions 
      between ataxia genes might influence the brain circuitry and thus affect the 
      clinical presentation of postural tremor.

TI  - Comparison of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 mouse models identifies early 
      gain-of-function, cell-autonomous transcriptional changes in oligodendrocytes.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. This expansion 
      leads to misfolding and aggregation of mutant ataxin-3 (ATXN3) and degeneration 
      of select brain regions. A key unanswered question in SCA3 and other 
      polyglutamine diseases is the extent to which neurodegeneration is mediated 
      through gain-of-function versus loss-of-function. To address this question in 
      SCA3, we performed transcriptional profiling on the brainstem, a highly 
      vulnerable brain region in SCA3, in a series of mouse models with varying degrees 
      of ATXN3 expression and aggregation. We include two SCA3 knock-in mouse models: 
      our previously published model that erroneously harbors a tandem duplicate of the 
      CAG repeat-containing exon, and a corrected model, introduced here. Both models 
      exhibit dose-dependent neuronal accumulation and aggregation of mutant ATXN3, but 
      do not exhibit a behavioral phenotype. We identified a molecular signature that 
      correlates with ATXN3 neuronal aggregation yet is primarily linked to 
      oligodendrocytes, highlighting early white matter dysfunction in SCA3. Two 
      robustly elevated oligodendrocyte transcripts, Acy3 and Tnfrsf13c, were confirmed 
      as elevated at the protein level in SCA3 human disease brainstem. To determine if 
      mutant ATXN3 acts on oligodendrocytes cell-autonomously, we manipulated the 
      repeat expansion in the variant SCA3 knock-in mouse by cell-type specific 
      Cre/LoxP recombination. Changes in oligodendrocyte transcripts are driven 
      cell-autonomously and occur independent of neuronal ATXN3 aggregation. Our 
      findings support a primary toxic gain of function mechanism and highlight a 
      previously unrecognized role for oligodendrocyte dysfunction in SCA3 disease 
      pathogenesis.

AB  - The most common dominantly inherited ataxia, spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 
      (SCA3), is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the ATXN3 gene that encodes an abnormally long polyglutamine tract 
      in the disease protein, ATXN3. Mice lacking ATXN3 are phenotypically normal; 
      hence, disease gene suppression offers a compelling approach to slow the 
      neurodegenerative cascade in SCA3. Here we tested antisense oligonucleotides 
      (ASOs) that target human ATXN3 in two complementary mouse models of SCA3: yeast 
      artificial chromosome (YAC) MJD-Q84.2 (Q84) mice expressing the full-length human 
      ATXN3 gene and cytomegalovirus (CMV) MJD-Q135 (Q135) mice expressing a human 
      ATXN3 cDNA. Intracerebroventricular injection of ASOs resulted in widespread 
      delivery to the most vulnerable brain regions in SCA3. In treated Q84 mice, three 
      of five tested ASOs reduced disease protein levels by >50% in the diencephalon, 
      cerebellum, and cervical spinal cord. Two ASOs also significantly reduced mutant 
      ATXN3 in the mouse forebrain and resulted in no signs of astrogliosis or 
      microgliosis. In Q135 mice expressing a single ATXN3 isoform via a cDNA 
      transgene, ASOs did not result in similar robust ATXN3 silencing. Our results 
      indicate that ASOs targeting full-length human ATXN3 would likely be well 
      tolerated and could lead to a preventative therapy for SCA3.

TI  - A panel study on patients with dominant cerebellar ataxia highlights the 
      frequency of channelopathies.
PG  - 1579-1594
LID - 10.1093/brain/awx081 [doi]
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias have a marked heterogeneous genetic 
      background, with mutations in 34 genes identified so far. This large amount of 
      implicated genes accounts for heterogeneous clinical presentations, making 
      genotype-phenotype correlations a major challenge in the field. While 
      polyglutamine ataxias, linked to CAG repeat expansions in genes such as ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, CACNA1A and TBP, have been extensively characterized in 
      large cohorts, there is a need for comprehensive assessment of frequency and 
      phenotype of more 'conventional' ataxias. After exclusion of CAG/polyglutamine 
      expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia genes in 412 index cases with dominantly 
      inherited cerebellar ataxias, we aimed to establish the relative frequencies of 
      mutations in other genes, with an approach combining panel sequencing and TaqMan(R) 
      polymerase chain reaction assay. We found relevant genetic variants in 59 
      patients (14.3%). The most frequently mutated were channel genes [CACNA1A (n = 
      16), KCND3 (n = 4), KCNC3 (n = 2) and KCNA1 (n = 2)]. Deletions in ITPR1 (n = 11) 
      were followed by biallelic variants in SPG7 (n = 9). Variants in AFG3L2 (n = 7) 
      came next in frequency, and variants were rarely found in STBN2 (n = 2), ELOVL5, 
      FGF14, STUB1 and TTBK2 (n = 1 each). Interestingly, possible risk factor variants 
      were detected in SPG7 and POLG. Clinical comparisons showed that ataxias due to 
      channelopathies had a significantly earlier age at onset with an average of 24.6 
      years, versus 40.9 years for polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias and 
      37.8 years for SPG7-related forms (P = 0.001). In contrast, disease duration was 
      significantly longer in the former (20.5 years versus 9.3 and 13.7, P=0.001), 
      though for similar functional stages, indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. Of interest, intellectual deficiency was more frequent in channel 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, while cognitive impairment in adulthood was similar 
      among the three groups. Similar differences were found among a single gene group, 
      comparing 23 patients with CACNA1A expansions (spinocerebellar ataxia 6) to 22 
      patients with CACNA1A point mutations, which had lower average age at onset (25.2 
      versus 47.3 years) with longer disease duration (18.7 versus 10.9), but lower 
      severity indexes (0.39 versus 0.44), indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. In conclusion, we identified relevant genetic variations in up to 15% of 
      cases after exclusion of polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias, and 
      confirmed CACNA1A and SPG7 as major ataxia genes. We could delineate firm 
      genotype-phenotype correlations that are important for genetic counselling and of 
      possible prognostic value.

TI  - Interaction of the polyglutamine protein ataxin-3 with Rad23 regulates toxicity 
      in Drosophila models of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3.
PG  - 1419-1431
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddx039 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the deubiquitinase ataxin-3 causes 
      neurodegeneration in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3), one of nine inherited, 
      incurable diseases caused by similar mutations. Ataxin-3's degradation is 
      inhibited by its binding to the proteasome shuttle Rad23 through 
      ubiquitin-binding site 2 (UbS2). Disrupting this interaction decreases levels of 
      ataxin-3. Since reducing levels of polyQ proteins can decrease their toxicity, we 
      tested whether genetically modulating the ataxin-3-Rad23 interaction regulates 
      its toxicity in Drosophila. We found that exogenous Rad23 increases the toxicity 
      of pathogenic ataxin-3, coincident with increased levels of the disease protein. 
      Conversely, reducing Rad23 levels alleviates toxicity in this SCA3 model. 
      Unexpectedly, pathogenic ataxin-3 with a mutated Rad23-binding site at UbS2, 
      despite being present at markedly lower levels, proved to be more pathogenic than 
      a disease-causing counterpart with intact UbS2. Additional studies established 
      that the increased toxicity upon mutating UbS2 stems from disrupting the 
      autoprotective role that pathogenic ataxin-3 has against itself, which depends on 
      the co-chaperone, DnaJ-1. Our data reveal a previously unrecognized balance 
      between pathogenic and potentially therapeutic properties of the ataxin-3-Rad23 
      interaction; they highlight this interaction as critical for the toxicity of the 
      SCA3 protein, and emphasize the importance of considering protein context when 
      pursuing suppressive avenues.

TI  - Compound heterozygous intermediate MJD alleles cause cerebellar ataxia with 
      sensory neuropathy.
PG  - e123
LID - e123
AB  - Spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) is a group of disorders characterized by 
      progressive ataxia caused by dysfunction and atrophy of the cerebellum or its 
      projections. Approximately one-third of SCD cases are familial SCD, the majority 
      of which are attributed to CAG triplet repeat expansions including 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, and dentate-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      triplet repeat number of the alleles representing complete penetrance varies 
      among diseases. Generally, there is a gap between the normal alleles and the 
      complete penetrance alleles. Rarely, intermediate alleles with the repeat numbers 
      between the abnormal and normal ranges are observed, although the implications of 
      these intermediate alleles remain ambiguous.

TI  - The Initial Symptom and Motor Progression in Spinocerebellar Ataxias.
PG  - 615-622
LID - 10.1007/s12311-016-0836-3 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study is to determine whether the initial symptom associates with 
      motor progression in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). SCAs are clinically 
      heterogeneous and the initial presentation may represent different subtypes of 
      SCA with different motor progression. We studied 317 participants with SCAs1, 2, 
      3, and 6 from the Clinical Research Consortium for SCAs (CRC-SCA) and repeatedly 
      measured the severity of ataxia for 2 years. SCA patients were divided into 
      gait-onset and non-gait-onset (speech, vision, and hand dexterity) groups based 
      on the initial presentation. In addition to demographic comparison, we employed 
      regression models to study ataxia progression in these two groups after adjusting 
      for age, sex, and pathological CAG repeats. The majority of SCA patients had gait 
      abnormality as an initial presentation. The pathological CAG repeat expansions 
      were similar between the gait-onset and non-gait-onset groups. In SCA1, 
      gait-onset group progressed slower than non-gait-onset group, while gait-onset 
      SCA6 group progressed faster than their counterpart. In addition, the disease 
      presented 9 years later for SCA2 gait-onset group than non-gait-onset group. 
      Initial symptoms of SCA3 did not influence age of onset or disease progression. 
      The initial symptom in each SCA has a different influence on age of onset and 
      motor progression. Therefore, gait and non-gait-onset groups of SCAs might 
      represent different subtypes of the diseases.

AB  - The neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is caused by a 
      CAG-repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. In this study, induced pluripotent stem 
      cell (iPSC) lines were established from two SCA3 patients. Dermal fibroblasts 
      were reprogrammed using an integration-free method and the resulting SCA3 iPSCs 
      were differentiated into neurons. These neuronal lines harbored the disease 
      causing mutation, expressed comparable levels of several neuronal markers and 
      responded to the neurotransmitters, glutamate/glycine, GABA and acetylcholine. 
      Additionally, all neuronal cultures formed networks displaying synchronized 
      spontaneous calcium oscillations within 28days of maturation, and expressed the 
      mature neuronal markers NeuN and Synapsin 1 implying a relatively advanced state 
      of maturity, although not comparable to that of the adult human brain. 
      Interestingly, we were not able to recapitulate the glutamate-induced ataxin-3 
      aggregation shown in a previously published iPSC-derived SCA3 model. In 
      conclusion, we have generated a panel of SCA3 patient iPSCs and a robust protocol 
      to derive neurons of relatively advanced maturity, which could potentially be 
      valuable for the study of SCA3 disease mechanisms.

AB  - Expansion of CAG repeats, which code for the disease-causing polyglutamine 
      protein, is a common feature in polyglutamine diseases. RNA-mediated mechanisms 
      that contribute to neuropathology in polyglutamine diseases are important. 
      RNA-toxicity describes a phenomenon by which the mutant CAG repeat RNA recruits 
      RNA-binding proteins, thereby leading to aberrant function. For example the MID1 
      protein binds to mutant huntingtin (HTT) RNA, which is linked to Huntington's 
      disease (HD), at its CAG repeat region and induces protein synthesis of mutant 
      protein. But is this mechanism specific to HD or is it a common mechanism in CAG 
      repeat expansion disorders? To answer this question, we have analyzed the 
      interaction between MID1 and three other CAG repeat mRNAs, Ataxin2 (ATXN2), 
      Ataxin3 (ATXN3), and Ataxin7 (ATXN7), that all differ in the sequence flanking 
      the CAG repeat. We show that ATXN2, ATXN3, and ATXN7 bind to MID1 in a CAG repeat 
      length-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that functionally, in line with 
      what we have previously observed for HTT, the binding of MID1 to ATXN2, ATXN3, 
      and ATXN7 mRNA induces protein synthesis in a repeat length-dependent manner. Our 
      data suggest that regulation of protein translation by the MID1 complex is a 
      common mechanism for CAG repeat containing mRNAs.

      proteolytic cleavage of ataxin-3.
PG  - 35200

LID - 35200
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 (SCA3) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      polyglutamine repeat expansion in the ataxin-3 protein. Cleavage of mutant 
      ataxin-3 by proteolytic enzymes yields ataxin-3 fragments containing the 
      polyglutamine stretch. These shorter ataxin-3 fragments are thought to be 
      involved in SCA3 pathogenesis due to their increased cellular toxicity and their 
      involvement in formation of the characteristic neuronal aggregates. As a strategy 
      to prevent formation of toxic cleavage fragments, we investigated an antisense 
      oligonucleotide-mediated modification of the ataxin-3 pre-mRNA through exon 
      skipping of exon 8 and 9, resulting in the removal of a central 88 amino acid 
      region of the ataxin-3 protein. This removed protein region contains several 
      predicted cleavage sites and two ubiquitin-interacting motifs. In contrast to 
      unmodified mutant ataxin-3, the internally truncated ataxin-3 protein did not 
      give rise to potentially toxic cleavage fragments when incubated with caspases. 
      In vitro experiments did not show cellular toxicity of the modified ataxin-3 
      protein. However, the modified protein was incapable of binding poly-ubiquitin 
      chains, which may interfere with its normal deubiquitinating function. Low exon 
      skipping efficiencies combined with reduction in important ataxin-3 protein 
      functions suggest that skipping of exon 8 and 9 is not a viable therapeutic 
      option for SCA3.

TI  - Clinical features and genetic diagnosis of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia 3.
PG  - 3731-4
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2016.5707 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a rare inherited autosomal dominant 
      progressive neurological disorder, which results from a CAG...repeat expansion in 
      the gene encoding the deubiquitinating enzyme, ataxin...3. At present, no effective 
      treatment is available for this fatal disorder; however, certain studies have 
      suggested that reducing the levels of mutant ataxin...3 protein may reverse or halt 
      the progression of disease in patients with SCA3. In the present study, clinical 
      examinations were performed on a patient with SCA3 who exhibited disease features 
      including coughing, expectoration and was bedridden with mobility limitation. CAG 
      repetitions at SCA...associated genes were detected in the patient's family by 
      performing standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and triple...repeat primed PCR. 
      The numbers of CAG...repeats within the two alleles of the gene of interest in the 
      patient were 15 and 78. Notably, the patient's brother, who harbored 
      76 CAG...repeats in one allele of the gene of interest, did not exhibit severe 
      disease symptoms. These results suggest that the number of CAG...repeats is a 
      critical for determination of SCA3 disease severity and time of onset. In 
      addition, the de fi ned phenotypic characteristics of the patient in the present 
      study provide useful insight for more accurate clinical diagnosis and genotyping 
      of future patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The natural history of clinical symptoms in the spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCA)s has been well characterised. However there is little longitudinal 
      data comparing cognitive changes in the most common SCA subtypes over time. The 
      present study provides a preliminary longitudinal characterisation of the 
      clinical and cognitive profiles in patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7, 
      with the aim of elucidating the role of the cerebellum in cognition. METHODS: 13 
      patients with different SCAs all caused by CAG repeat expansion (SCA1, n = 2; 
      SCA2, n = 2; SCA3, n = 2; SCA6, n = 4; and SCA7, n = 3) completed a comprehensive 
      battery of cognitive and mood assessments at two time points, a mean of 
      7.35 years apart. All patients were evaluated clinically using the Scale for the 
      Rating and Assessment of Ataxia (SARA) and the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs 
      (INAS). Patients underwent structural MRI imaging at follow-up. RESULTS: Clinical 
      scale scores increased in all patients over time, most prominently in the SCA1 
      (SARA) and SCA3 (INAS) groups. New impairments on neuropsychological tests were 
      most commonly observed with executive functions, speed, attention, visual memory 
      and Theory of Mind. Results suggest possible differences in cognitive decline in 
      SCA subtypes, with the most rapid cognitive decline observed in the SCA1 
      patients, and the least in the SCA6 patients, congruent with observed patterns of 
      motor deterioration. Minimal changes in mood were observed, and MRI measures of 
      atrophy did not correlate with cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: As well as 
      increasing physical impairment, cognitive decline over time appears to be a 
      distinct aspect of the SCA phenotype, in keeping with the cerebellar 
      cognitive-affective syndrome. Our data suggest a trend of cognitive decline that 
      is different for each SCA subtype, and for the majority is related to the 
      severity of cerebellar motor impairment.

AB  - RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a widely used technique for 
      detecting transcripts in fixed cells and tissues. Many variants of RNA FISH have 
      been proposed to increase signal strength, resolution and target specificity. The 
      current variants of this technique facilitate the detection of the subcellular 
      localization of transcripts at a single molecule level. Among the applications of 
      RNA FISH are studies on nuclear RNA foci in diseases resulting from the expansion 
      of tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide repeats present in different single 
      genes. The partial or complete retention of mutant transcripts forming RNA 
      aggregates within the nucleoplasm has been shown in multiple cellular disease 
      models and in the tissues of patients affected with these atypical mutations. 
      Relevant diseases include, among others, myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) with CUG 
      repeats, Huntington's disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) with 
      CAG repeats, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) with CGG 
      repeats, myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) with CCUG repeats, amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD) with GGGGCC repeats and 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 32 (SCA32) with GGCCUG. In this article, we summarize 
      the results obtained with FISH to examine RNA nuclear inclusions. We provide a 
      detailed protocol for detecting RNAs containing expanded CAG and CUG repeats in 
      different cellular models, including fibroblasts, lymphoblasts, induced 
      pluripotent stem cells and murine and human neuronal progenitors. We also present 
      the results of the first single-molecule FISH application in a cellular model of 
      polyglutamine disease.

AB  - A major pathological hallmark in several neurodegenerative disorders, like 
      polyglutamine disorders (polyQ), including Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), is the 
      formation of protein aggregates. MJD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the 
      ATXN3 gene, resulting in an abnormal protein, which is prone to misfolding and 
      forms cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates within neurons, ultimately inducing 
      neurodegeneration. Treatment of proteinopathies with drugs that up-regulate 
      autophagy has shown promising results in models of polyQ diseases. Temsirolimus 
      (CCI-779) inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (m-TOR), while lithium 
      chloride (LiCl) acts by inhibiting inositol monophosphatase, both being able to 
      induce autophagy. We have previously shown that chronic treatment with LiCl (10.4 
      mg/kg) had limited effects in a transgenic MJD mouse model. Also, others have 
      shown that CCI-779 had mild positive effects in a different mouse model of the 
      disease. It has been suggested that the combination of mTOR-dependent and 
      -independent autophagy inducers could be a more effective therapeutic approach. 
      To further explore this avenue toward therapy, we treated CMVMJD135 transgenic 
      mice with a conjugation of CCI-779 and LiCl, both at concentrations known to 
      induce autophagy and not to be toxic. Surprisingly, this combined treatment 
      proved to be deleterious to both wild-type (wt) and transgenic animals, failing 
      to rescue their neurological symptoms and actually exerting neurotoxic effects. 
      These results highlight the possible dangers of manipulating autophagy in the 
      nervous system and suggest that a better understanding of the potential 
      disruption in the autophagy pathway in MJD is required before successful 
      long-term autophagy modulating therapies can be developed.

AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease, caused by 
      a CAG repeat expansion within the coding region of ATXN3 gene, and which 
      currently lacks effective treatment. In this work we tested the therapeutic 
      efficacy of chronic treatment with valproic acid (VPA) (200mg/kg), a compound 
      with known neuroprotection activity, and previously shown to be effective in 
      cell, fly and nematode models of MJD. We show that chronic VPA treatment in the 
      CMVMJD135 mouse model had limited effects in the motor deficits of these mice, 
      seen mostly at late stages in the motor swimming, beam walk, rotarod and 
      spontaneous locomotor activity tests, and did not modify the ATXN3 inclusion load 
      and astrogliosis in affected brain regions. However, VPA chronic treatment was 
      able to increase GRP78 protein levels at 30 weeks of age, one of its known 
      neuroprotective effects, confirming target engagement. In spite of limited 
      results, the use of another dosage of VPA or of VPA in a combined therapy with 
      molecules targeting other pathways, cannot be excluded as potential strategies 
      for MJD therapeutics.

TI  - Overexpression of Cystathionine gamma-Lyase Suppresses Detrimental Effects of 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3.
PG  - 758-768
LID - 10.2119/molmed.2015.00221 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a polyglutamine (polyQ) disorder caused 
      by a CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin-3 (ATXN3) gene resulting in toxic protein 
      aggregation. Inflammation and oxidative stress are considered secondary factors 
      contributing to the progression of this neurodegenerative disease. There is no 
      cure that halts or reverses the progressive neurodegeneration of SCA3. Here we 
      show that overexpression of cystathionine gamma-lyase, a central enzyme in cysteine 
      metabolism, is protective in a Drosophila model for SCA3. SCA3 flies show eye 
      degeneration, increased oxidative stress, insoluble protein aggregates, reduced 
      levels of protein persulfidation and increased activation of the innate immune 
      response. Overexpression of Drosophila cystathionine gamma-lyase restores protein 
      persulfidation, decreases oxidative stress, dampens the immune response and 
      improves SCA3-associated tissue degeneration. Levels of insoluble protein 
      aggregates are not altered; therefore, the data implicate a modifying role of 
      cystathionine gamma-lyase in ameliorating the downstream consequence of protein 
      aggregation leading to protection against SCA3-induced tissue degeneration. The 
      cystathionine gamma-lyase expression is decreased in affected brain tissue of SCA3 
      patients, suggesting that enhancers of cystathionine gamma-lyase expression or 
      activity are attractive candidates for future therapies.

TI  - Long-term disease progression in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, and 6: a 
      longitudinal cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias are dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      diseases. As potential treatments for these diseases are being developed, precise 
      knowledge of their natural history is needed. We aimed to study the long-term 
      disease progression of the most common spinocerebellar ataxias: SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, 
      and SCA6. Furthermore, we aimed to establish the order and occurrence of 
      non-ataxia symptoms, and identify predictors of disease progression. METHODS: In 
      this longitudinal cohort study (EUROSCA), we enrolled men and women with positive 
      genetic testing for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 and with progressive, otherwise 
      unexplained ataxia who were aged 18 years or older from 17 ataxia referral 
      centres in ten European countries. Patients were seen every year for 3 years, and 
      at irregular intervals thereafter. The primary outcome was the scale for the 
      assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA), and the inventory of non-ataxia signs 
      (INAS). We used linear mixed models to analyse progression. To account for 
      dropouts, we applied a pattern-mixture model. This study is registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02440763. FINDINGS: Between July 1, 2005, and Aug 
      31, 2006, 526 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 were enrolled. We analysed 
      data for 462 patients with at least one follow-up visit. Median observation time 
      was 49 months (IQR 35-72). SARA progression data were best fitted with a linear 
      model in all genotypes. Annual SARA score increase was 2.11 (SE 0.12) in patients 
      with SCA1, 1.49 (0.07) in patients with SCA2, 1.56 (0.08) in patients with SCA3, 
      and 0.80 (0.09) in patients with SCA6. The increase of the number of non-ataxia 
      signs reached a plateau in SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3. In patients with SCA6, the 
      number of non-ataxia symptoms increased linearly, but more slowly than in 
      patients with SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 (p<0.0001). Factors that were associated with 
      faster progression of the SARA score were short duration of follow-up (p=0.0179), 
      older age at inclusion (0.04 [SE 0.02] per additional year; p=0.0476), and longer 
      repeat expansions (0.06 [SE 0.02] per additional repeat unit; p=0.0128) in SCA1, 
      short duration of follow-up (p<0.0001), lower age at onset (-0.02 [SE 0.01] per 
      additional year; p=0.0014), and lower baseline SARA score (-0.02 [SE 0.01] per 
      additional SARA point; p=0.0083) in SCA2, and lower baseline SARA score (-0.03 
      [SE 0.01] per additional SARA point; p=0.0195) in SCA6. In SCA3, we did not 
      identify factors that affected progression of the SARA score. INTERPRETATION: Our 
      study provides quantitative data on the progression of the most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxias based on a follow-up period that exceeds those of 
      previous studies. Our data could prove useful for sample size calculation and 
      patient stratification in interventional trials. FUNDING: EU FP6 (EUROSCA),

AB  - BACKGROUND: About 50 % of Thai patients with adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) was Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6. The author 
      investigated further on less common SCAs in the patients without any known 
      mutations. METHODS: DNA samples of 82 index patients who were genetically 
      excluded MJD, SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) were examined. Analysis of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, SCA17 and SCA19 genes were 
      comprehensively performed. Normal range of trinucleotide repeat expansion sizes 
      of TATA-box-binding protein gene (TBP) were also determined in 374 control 
      subjects. RESULTS: Eight patients carried >/=42 CAG/CAA repeat allele in the TBP 
      consistent with SCA17. The pathological repeat alleles ranged from 42 to 57 
      repeats. All patients had significant degree of cognitive dysfunction. Other 
      non-ataxic phenotypes comprised of parkinsonism, chorea, dystonia and myoclonus. 
      A sporadic patient carried a heterozygous 41-repeat allele developed chronic 
      progressive cerebellar degeneration commenced at the age of 28 years. Whilst, 2 % 
      of the control subjects (8/374) carried the 41-repeat allele. Five of the 
      carriers were re-examined, and revealed that four of them had parkinsonism and/or 
      cognitive impairment without cerebellar signs. Analysis of other types of SCAs 
      was all negative. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA17 and SCA19 in Thais. SCA17 appears to be an important cause of ataxia in 
      Thailand. Although, the pathological cut-off point of the TBP repeat allele 
      remains unclear, the finding suggests that the 41-repeat may be a pathological 
      allele resulting late-onset or mild phenotype. Apart from ataxia, cognitive 
      impairment and parkinsonism may be clinical presentations in these carriers.

TI  - No parkinsonism in SCA2 and SCA3 despite severe neurodegeneration of the 
      dopaminergic substantia nigra.
PG  - 3316-26
LID - 10.1093/brain/awv255 [doi]
AB  - See Klockgether (doi:10.1093/awv253) for a scientific commentary on this 
      article.The spinocerebellar ataxias types 2 (SCA2) and 3 (SCA3) are autosomal 
      dominantly inherited cerebellar ataxias which are caused by CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat expansions in the coding regions of the disease-specific genes. Although 
      previous post-mortem studies repeatedly revealed a consistent neurodegeneration 
      of the dopaminergic substantia nigra in patients with SCA2 and with SCA3, 
      parkinsonian motor features evolve only rarely. As the pathophysiological 
      mechanism how SCA2 and SCA3 patients do not exhibit parkinsonism is still 
      enigmatic, we performed a positron emission tomography and a post-mortem study of 
      two independent cohorts of SCA2 and SCA3 patients with and without parkinsonian 
      features. Positron emission tomography revealed a significant reduction of 
      dopamine transporter levels in the striatum as well as largely unaffected 
      postsynaptic striatal D2 receptors. In spite of this remarkable pathology in the 
      motor mesostriatal pathway, only 4 of 19 SCA2 and SCA3 patients suffered from 
      parkinsonism. The post-mortem investigation revealed, in addition to an extensive 
      neuronal loss in the dopaminergic substantia nigra of all patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia, a consistent affection of the thalamic ventral anterior 
      and ventral lateral nuclei, the pallidum and the cholinergic pedunculopontine 
      nucleus. With the exception of a single patient with SCA3 who suffered from 
      parkinsonian motor features during his lifetime, the subthalamic nucleus 
      underwent severe neuronal loss, which was clearly more severe in its motor 
      territory than in its limbic or associative territories. Our observation that 
      lesions of the motor territory of the subthalamic nucleus were consistently 
      associated with the prevention of parkinsonism in our SCA2 and SCA3 patients 
      matches the clinical experience that selective targeting of the motor territory 
      of the subthalamic nucleus by focal lesions or deep brain stimulation can 
      ameliorate parkinsonian motor features and is likely to counteract the 
      manifestation of parkinsonism in SCA2 and SCA3 despite a severe neurodegeneration 
      of the dopaminergic substantia nigra.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aim to clarify the pathogenic role of intermediate size repeat 
      expansions of SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 as risk factors for idiopathic 
      Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: We invited researchers from the Genetic 
      Epidemiology of Parkinson's Disease Consortium to participate in the study. There 
      were 12,346 cases and 8,164 controls genotyped, for a total of 4 repeats within 
      the SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 genes. Fixed- and random-effects models were used 
      to estimate the summary risk estimates for the genes. We investigated 
      between-study heterogeneity and heterogeneity between different ethnic 
      populations. RESULTS: We did not observe any definite pathogenic repeat 
      expansions for SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 genes in patients with idiopathic PD 
      from Caucasian and Asian populations. Furthermore, overall analysis did not 
      reveal any significant association between intermediate repeats and PD. The 
      effect estimates (odds ratio) ranged from 0.93 to 1.01 in the overall cohort for 
      the SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 loci. CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not support a 
      major role for definite pathogenic repeat expansions in SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and 
      SCA17 genes for idiopathic PD. Thus, results of this large study do not support 
      diagnostic screening of SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 gene repeats in the common 
      idiopathic form of PD. Likewise, this largest multicentered study performed to 
      date excludes the role of intermediate repeats of these genes as a risk factor 
      for PD.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also called Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), 
      is one of the most common SCAs worldwide and caused by a CAG repeat expansion 
      located in ATXN3 gene. Based on the CAG repeat numbers, alleles of ATXN3 can be 
      divided into normal alleles (ANs), intermediate alleles (AIs) and expanded 
      alleles (AEs). It was controversial whether the frequency of large normal alleles 
      (large ANs) is related to the prevalence of SCA3 or not. And there were huge 
      chaos in the comprehension of the specific numbers of the range of CAG repeats 
      which is fundamental for genetic analysis of SCA3. To illustrate these issues, we 
      made a novel CAG repeat ladder to detect CAG repeats of ATXN3 in 1003 unrelated 
      Chinese normal individuals and studied haplotypes defined by three single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) closed to ATXN3. We found that the number of CAG 
      repeats ranged from 13 to 49, among them, 14 was the most common number. Positive 
      skew, the highest frequency of large ANs and 4 AIs which had never been reported 
      before were found. Also, AEs and large ANs shared the same haplotypes defined by 
      the SNPs. Based on these data and other related studies, we presumed that de novo 
      mutations of ATXN3 emerging from large ANs are at least one survival mechanisms 
      of mutational ATXN3 and we can redefine the range of CAG repeats as: ANs</=44, 45 
      </=AIs </=49 and AEs>/=50.

AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders are a heterogeneous group of chronic progressive 
      diseases and have pathological mechanisms in common. A certain causative gene 
      identified for a particular disease may be found to play roles in more than one 
      neurodegenerative disorder. We analyzed the GGGGCC repeat expansions of C9orf72 
      gene in patients with SCA3/MJD from mainland China to determine whether the 
      C9orf72 gene plays a role in the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD. In our study, there 
      were no pathogenic repeats (>30 repeats) detected in either the patients or 
      controls. SCA3/MJD patients with intermediate/intermediate or short/intermediate 
      genotype (short: <7 repeats; intermediate: 7-30 repeats) of the GGGGCC repeats 
      had an earlier onset compared with those with short/short genotype. The presence 
      of the intermediate allele of the GGGGCC repeats in the patients decreased the 
      age at onset by nearly 3 years. Our study firstly demonstrate that the 
      development of SCA3/MJD may involve some physiological functions of the C9orf72 
      gene and provide new evidence to the hypothesis that a specific mutation 
      identified in one of the neurodegenerative disorders may be a modulator in this 
      class of diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association of repeat expansion size in 10 common 
      degenerative hereditary ataxia genes with essential tremor. These genes were 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 
      (CACNA1A), SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), 
      SCA-17 (TBP) and dentatorubral-pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA) (ATN1). METHODS: 
      Genetic analysis of repeat size in 10 degenerative hereditary ataxia loci was 
      performed in 323 essential tremor patients and 299 controls enrolled at Columbia 
      University. To test for differences in the allele distribution between patients 
      and controls, a CLUMP analysis was performed. RESULTS: None of the essential 
      tremor patients had a repeat expansion in the intermediate or pathogenic range. 
      Significant differences in the distribution of repeats in the 'normal' range for 
      SCA2 and SCA8 (both p </= 0.02) were observed between essential tremor patients and 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      SCA loci are not associated with essential tremor.

TI  - Clinical Scales Predict Significant Videofluoroscopic Dysphagia in Machado Joseph 
      Disease Patients.
PG  - 260-266
LID - 10.1002/mdc3.12173 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although aspiration is one of the main causes of death in SCA, such 
      as SCA3/Machado Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), clinical studies on dysphagia are 
      lacking for these diseases. The aims of this study were to characterize dysphagia 
      in SCA3/MJD through videofluoroscopy (VF) of swallowing, correlate VF with 
      disease severity criteria and weight loss, and determine the clinical criteria 
      cutoffs for performing VF in the clinical routine, in order to detect aspiration. 
      METHODS: A cross-sectional study on 34 SCA3/MJD patients was performed. Clinical 
      and molecular data, as well as body mass index (BMI), were obtained. Neurological 
      scales, such as the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), and the 
      Swallowing Quality of Life (SWAL-QOL) questionnaire were applied. The VF scores, 
      Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale (DOSS) and penetration/aspiration scale 
      (PAS), were obtained: Moderate-to-severe scores were grouped as "significant 
      dysphagia." RESULTS: Overall, 31 of 34 individuals showed abnormal scores at VF. 
      SARA, BMI, and the domain "eating duration" of SWAL-QOL correlated with VF: Their 
      relation to significant dysphagia (DOSS <4 points or PAS >3) was evaluated 
      through receiver operating characteristic curves. A sensitivity of 100% was 
      equivalent to a cutoff of 15 points on SARA score, 23.72 kg/m(2) on BMI, and 60% 
      on eating duration-SWAL-QOL (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Significant dysphagia was not 
      related to age at onset, disease duration, or CAG repeat expansion, but with SARA 
      scores, lower BMI, and the domain eating duration of SWAL-QOL. As a guideline for 
      preventing aspiration, we suggest that SARA scores greater than 15 or eating 
      duration-SWAL-QOL lower than 60% should urge VF studies in SCA3/MJD.

TI  - The role of the mammalian DNA end-processing enzyme polynucleotide kinase 
      3'-phosphatase in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 pathogenesis.
PG  - e1004749
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004749 [doi]
LID - e1004749
AB  - DNA strand-breaks (SBs) with non-ligatable ends are generated by ionizing 
      radiation, oxidative stress, various chemotherapeutic agents, and also as base 
      excision repair (BER) intermediates. Several neurological diseases have already 
      been identified as being due to a deficiency in DNA end-processing activities. 
      Two common dirty ends, 3'-P and 5'-OH, are processed by mammalian polynucleotide 
      kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP), a bifunctional enzyme with 3'-phosphatase and 
      5'-kinase activities. We have made the unexpected observation that PNKP stably 
      associates with Ataxin-3 (ATXN3), a polyglutamine repeat-containing protein 
      mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph 
      Disease (MJD). This disease is one of the most common dominantly inherited 
      ataxias worldwide; the defect in SCA3 is due to CAG repeat expansion (from the 
      normal 14-41 to 55-82 repeats) in the ATXN3 coding region. However, how the 
      expanded form gains its toxic function is still not clearly understood. Here we 
      report that purified wild-type (WT) ATXN3 stimulates, and by contrast the mutant 
      form specifically inhibits, PNKP's 3' phosphatase activity in vitro. 
      ATXN3-deficient cells also show decreased PNKP activity. Furthermore, transgenic 
      mice conditionally expressing the pathological form of human ATXN3 also showed 
      decreased 3'-phosphatase activity of PNKP, mostly in the deep cerebellar nuclei, 
      one of the most affected regions in MJD patients' brain. Finally, long amplicon 
      quantitative PCR analysis of human MJD patients' brain samples showed a 
      significant accumulation of DNA strand breaks. Our results thus indicate that the 
      accumulation of DNA strand breaks due to functional deficiency of PNKP is 
      etiologically linked to the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD.

AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that are related 
      to at least 36 different genetic loci; they are clinically characterized by 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia and are frequently accompanied by other 
      neurological and non-neurological manifestations. The relative frequency of SCA 
      varies greatly among different regions, presumably because of a founder effect or 
      local ethnicities. Between July 1998 and May 2012, we investigated 320 Brazilian 
      patients with an SCA phenotype who belonged to 150 unrelated families with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and 23 sporadic patients from 13 Brazilian 
      states. A total of 265 patients (82.8%) belonging to 131 unrelated families 
      (87.3%) were found to have a definite mutation, and SCA3 accounted for most of 
      the familial cases (70.7%), followed by SCA7 (6%), SCA1 (5.3%), SCA2 (2.7%), SCA6 
      (1.3%), SCA8 (0.7%) and SCA10 (0.7%). In the Ribeirao Preto mesoregion, which is 
      located in the northeast part of Sao Paulo State, the prevalence of SCA3 was 
      approximately 5 per 100,000 inhabitants, which is the highest prevalence found in 
      Brazil. No mutation was found in the SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA genes, and all the 
      sporadic cases remained without a molecular diagnosis. This study further 
      characterizes the spectrum of SCA mutations found in Brazilian patients, which 
      suggests the existence of regional differences and demonstrates the expansion of 
      the SCA8 locus in Brazilian families.

TI  - A knockin mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 exhibits prominent 
      aggregate pathology and aberrant splicing of the disease gene transcript.
PG  - 1211-24
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddu532 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine diseases, including spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), are 
      caused by CAG repeat expansions that encode abnormally long glutamine repeats in 
      the respective disease proteins. While the mechanisms underlying 
      neurodegeneration remain uncertain, evidence supports a proteotoxic role for the 
      mutant protein dictated in part by the specific genetic and protein context. To 
      further define pathogenic mechanisms in SCA3, we generated a mouse model in which 
      a CAG expansion of 82 repeats was inserted into the murine locus by homologous 
      recombination. SCA3 knockin mice exhibit region-specific aggregate pathology 
      marked by intranuclear accumulation of the mutant Atxn3 protein, abundant nuclear 
      inclusions and, in select brain regions, extranuclear aggregates localized to 
      neuritic processes. Knockin mice also display altered splicing of the disease 
      gene, promoting expression of an alternative isoform in which the intron 
      immediately downstream of the CAG repeat is retained. In an independent mouse 
      model expressing the full human ATXN3 disease gene, expression of this 
      alternatively spliced transcript is also enhanced. These results, together with 
      recent findings in other polyglutamine diseases, suggest that CAG repeat 
      expansions can promote aberrant splicing to produce potentially more 
      aggregate-prone isoforms of the disease proteins. This report of a SCA3 knockin 
      mouse expands the repertoire of existing models of SCA3, and underscores the 
      potential contribution of alternative splicing to disease pathogenesis in SCA3 
      and other polyglutamine disorders.

TI  - Ubiquitin-binding site 2 of ataxin-3 prevents its proteasomal degradation by 
      interacting with Rad23.
PG  - 4638

AB  - Polyglutamine repeat expansion in ataxin-3 causes neurodegeneration in the most 
      common dominant ataxia, spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). Since reducing 
      levels of disease proteins improves pathology in animals, we investigated how 
      ataxin-3 is degraded. Here we show that, unlike most proteins, ataxin-3 turnover 
      does not require its ubiquitination, but is regulated by ubiquitin-binding site 2 
      (UbS2) on its N terminus. Mutating UbS2 decreases ataxin-3 protein levels in 
      cultured mammalian cells and in Drosophila melanogaster by increasing its 
      proteasomal turnover. Ataxin-3 interacts with the proteasome-associated proteins 
      Rad23A/B through UbS2. Knockdown of Rad23 in cultured cells and in Drosophila 
      results in lower levels of ataxin-3 protein. Importantly, reducing Rad23 
      suppresses ataxin-3-dependent degeneration in flies. We present a mechanism for 
      ubiquitination-independent degradation that is impeded by protein interactions 
      with proteasome-associated factors. We conclude that UbS2 is a potential target 
      through which to enhance ataxin-3 degradation for SCA3 therapy.

AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is caused by a (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      that is translated into an abnormally long polyglutamine tract. This disease is 
      considered the most common form of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). In the present 
      study, we developed stable inducible cell lines (PC12Tet-On-Ataxin-3-Q28/84) 
      expressing ataxin-3 with either normal or abnormal CAG repeats under doxycycline 
      control. The expression of acetyl histone H3 and the induction of c-Fos in 
      response to cAMP were strongly suppressed in cells expressing the protein with 
      the expanded polyglutamine tract. Treatment with valproic acid, a histone 
      deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), attenuated mutant ataxin-3-induced cell toxicity 
      and suppression of acetyl histone H3, phosphorylated cAMP-responsive element 
      binding protein (p-CREB) as well as c-Fos expression. These results indicate that 
      VPA can stimulate the up-regulation of gene transcription through 
      hyperacetylation. Thus, VPA might have a therapeutic effect on MJD.

TI  - Modifiers of (CAG)(n) instability in Machado-Joseph disease (MJD/SCA3) 
      transmissions: an association study with DNA replication, repair and 
      recombination genes.
PG  - 1311-8
LID - 10.1007/s00439-014-1467-8 [doi]
AB  - Twelve neurological disorders are caused by gene-specific CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions that are highly unstable upon transmission to offspring. This 
      intergenerational repeat instability is clinically relevant since disease onset, 
      progression and severity are associated with repeat size. Studies of model 
      organisms revealed the involvement of some DNA replication and repair genes in 
      the process of repeat instability, however, little is known about their role in 
      patients. Here, we used an association study to search for genetic modifiers of 
      (CAG)n instability in 137 parent-child transmissions in Machado-Joseph disease 
      (MJD/SCA3). With the hypothesis that variants in genes involved in DNA 
      replication, repair or recombination might alter the MJD CAG instability 
      patterns, we screened 768 SNPs from 93 of these genes. We found a variant in 
      ERCC6 (rs2228528) associated with an expansion bias of MJD alleles. When using a 
      gene-gene interaction model, the allele combination G-A (rs4140804-rs2972388) of 
      RPA3-CDK7 is also associated with MJD instability in a direction-dependent 
      manner. Interestingly, the transcription-coupled repair factor ERCC6 (aka CSB), 
      the single-strand binding protein RPA, and the CDK7 kinase part of the TFIIH 
      transcription repair complex, have all been linked to transcription-coupled 
      repair. This is the first study performed in patient samples to implicate 
      specific modifiers of CAG instability in humans. In summary, we found variants in 
      three transcription-coupled repair genes associated with the MJD mutation that 
      points to distinct mechanisms of (CAG)n instability.

TI  - Modulation of the age at onset in spinocerebellar ataxia by CAG tracts in various 
      genes.
PG  - 2444-55
LID - 10.1093/brain/awu174 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine-coding (CAG)n repeat expansions in seven different genes cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxias. Although the size of the expansion is negatively 
      correlated with age at onset, it accounts for only 50-70% of its variability. To 
      find other factors involved in this variability, we performed a regression 
      analysis in 1255 affected individuals with identified expansions (spinocerebellar 
      ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7), recruited through the European Consortium on 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxias, to determine whether age at onset is influenced by the 
      size of the normal allele in eight causal (CAG)n-containing genes (ATXN1-3, 6-7, 
      17, ATN1 and HTT). We confirmed the negative effect of the expanded allele and 
      detected threshold effects reflected by a quadratic association between age at 
      onset and CAG size in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 3 and 6. We also evidenced 
      an interaction between the expanded and normal alleles in trans in individuals 
      with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 6 and 7. Except for individuals with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, age at onset was also influenced by other 
      (CAG)n-containing genes: ATXN7 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2; ATXN2, ATN1 and 
      HTT in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3; ATXN1 and ATXN3 in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 6; and ATXN3 and TBP in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7. This suggests that 
      there are biological relationships among these genes. The results were partially 
      replicated in four independent populations representing 460 Caucasians and 216 
      Asian samples; the differences are possibly explained by ethnic or geographical 
      differences. As the variability in age at onset is not completely explained by 
      the effects of the causative and modifier sister genes, other genetic or 
      environmental factors must also play a role in these diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA)--SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and 
      SCA6--are caused by (CAG)n repeat expansion. While the number of repeats of the 
      coding (CAG)n expansions is correlated with the age at onset, there are no 
      appropriate models that include both affected and preclinical carriers allowing 
      for the prediction of age at onset. METHODS: We combined data from two major 
      European cohorts of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6 mutation carriers: 1187 affected 
      individuals from the EUROSCA registry and 123 preclinical individuals from the 
      RISCA cohort. For each SCA genotype, a regression model was fitted using a 
      log-normal distribution for age at onset with the repeat length of the alleles as 
      covariates. From these models, we calculated expected age at onset from birth and 
      conditionally that this age is greater than the current age. RESULTS: For SCA2 
      and SCA3 genotypes, the expanded allele was a significant predictor of age at 
      onset (-0.105+/-0.005 and -0.056+/-0.003) while for SCA1 and SCA6 genotypes both the 
      size of the expanded and normal alleles were significant (expanded: -0.049+/-0.002 
      and -0.090+/-0.009, respectively; normal: +0.013+/-0.005 and -0.029+/-0.010, 
      respectively). According to the model, we indicated the median values (90% 
      critical region) and the expectancy (SD) of the predicted age at onset for each 
      SCA genotype according to the CAG repeat size and current age. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      estimations can be valuable in clinical and research. However, results need to be 
      confirmed in other independent cohorts and in future longitudinal studies.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17 and 
      dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy, as well as Huntington disease, are a group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders caused by a CAG triplet-repeat expansion encoding a 
      long polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the respective mutant proteins. The 
      cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregate formation, a pathological hallmark of polyQ 
      diseases, is probably the initial process triggering the subsequent pathological 
      events. Compromised oxidative stress defense capacity and mitochondrial 
      dysfunction have emerged as contributing factors to the pathogenesis of polyQ 
      diseases. The roots of licorice (Glycyrrhiza species) have long been used as an 
      herbal medicine. In this study, we demonstrate the aggregate-inhibitory effect of 
      Glycyrrhiza inflata herb extract and its constituents licochalcone A and ammonium 
      glycyrrhizinate (AMGZ) in both 293 and SH-SY5Y ATXN3/Q75 cells, SCA3 cell models. 
      The reporter assay showed that G. inflata herb extract, licochalcone A, and AMGZ 
      could enhance the promoter activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
      gamma, coactivator 1alpha (PPARGC1A), a known regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and 
      antioxidative response genes. G. inflata extract, licochalcone A, and AMGZ 
      upregulated PPARGC1A expression and its downstream target genes, SOD2 and CYCS, 
      in the 293 ATXN3/Q75 cell model. The expression of nuclear factor erythroid 
      2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2), the principal transcription factor that binds to 
      antioxidant-responsive elements (AREs) to promote ARE-dependent gene expression 
      when the cells respond to oxidative stress, and its downstream genes, HMOX1, 
      NQO1, GCLC, and GSTP1, was also increased by G. inflata herb extract, 
      licochalcone A, and AMGZ. Knockdown of PPARGC1A increased aggregates in ATXN3/Q75 
      cells and also attenuated the aggregate-inhibiting effect of the tested 
      compounds. G. inflata extract and its constituents significantly elevated 
      GSH/GSSG ratio and reduced reactive oxidative species in ATXN3/Q75 cells. The 
      study results suggest that the tested agents activate PPARGC1A activity and 
      NFE2L2-ARE signaling to increase mitochondrial biogenesis, decrease oxidative 
      stress, and reduce aggregate formation in SCA3 cellular models.

AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansions that lead to the formation of amyloid 
      aggregates are linked to several devastating neurodegenerative disorders. While 
      molecular chaperones, including the small heat shock proteins (sHsp), play an 
      important role in protection against protein misfolding, the aberrant protein 
      folding that accompanies these polyQ diseases overwhelms the chaperone network. 
      By generating a model structure to explain the observed suppression of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) by the sHsp alphaB-crystallin, we have identified key 
      vulnerabilities that provide a possible mechanism to explain this heat shock 
      response. A docking study involving a small bioactive peptide should also aid in 
      the development of new drug targets for the prevention of polyQ-based 
      aggregation.

TI  - Ataxin-3 protein modification as a treatment strategy for spinocerebellar ataxia

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the 
      ataxin-3 protein, resulting in gain of toxic function of the mutant protein. The 
      expanded glutamine stretch in the protein is the result of a CAG triplet repeat 
      expansion in the penultimate exon of the ATXN3 gene. Several gene silencing 
      approaches to reduce mutant ataxin-3 toxicity in this disease aim to lower 
      ataxin-3 protein levels, but since this protein is involved in deubiquitination 
      and proteasomal protein degradation, its long-term silencing might not be 
      desirable. Here, we propose a novel protein modification approach to reduce 
      mutant ataxin-3 toxicity by removing the toxic polyglutamine repeat from the 
      ataxin-3 protein through antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping while 
      maintaining important wild type functions of the protein. In vitro studies showed 
      that exon skipping did not negatively impact the ubiquitin binding capacity of 
      ataxin-3. Our in vivo studies showed no toxic properties of the novel truncated 
      ataxin-3 protein. These results suggest that exon skipping may be a novel 
      therapeutic approach to reduce polyglutamine-induced toxicity in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 3.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) also known as Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD), 
      is one of nine polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases caused by a CAG-trinucelotide 
      repeat expansion within the coding sequence of the ATXN3 gene. There are no 
      disease-modifying treatments for polyQ diseases. Recent studies suggest that an 
      imbalance in histone acetylation may be a key process leading to transcriptional 
      dysregulation in polyQ diseases. Because of this possible imbalance, the 
      application of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors may be feasible for the 
      treatment of polyQ diseases. To further explore the therapeutic potential of HDAC 
      inhibitors, we constructed two independent preclinical trials with valproic acid 
      (VPA), a promising therapeutic HDAC inhibitor, in both Drosophila and cell SCA3 
      models. We demonstrated that prolonged use of VPA at specific dose partly 
      prevented eye depigmentation, alleviated climbing disability, and extended the 
      average lifespan of SCA3/MJD transgenic Drosophila. We found that VPA could both 
      increase the acetylation levels of histone H3 and histone H4 and reduce the early 
      apoptotic rate of cells without inhibiting the aggregation of mutant ataxin-3 
      proteins in MJDtr-Q68- expressing cells. These results collectively support the 
      premise that VPA is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of SCA3 and 
      other polyQ diseases.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. CAG (cytosine-adenine-guanine) trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 
      causative genes have been identified as the cause of different SCA. In this 
      study, we simultaneously genotyped SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 applying a 
      fluorescent multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay. We analyzed 10 families 
      with SCA (64 patients) from five different communities of Veracruz, a Mexican 
      southeastern state, and identified 55 patients for SCA7 and 9 for SCA2, but none 
      for SCA1, SCA3, or SCA6. To our knowledge, this sample represents one of the 
      largest series of SCA7 cases reported worldwide. Genotyping of 300 healthy 
      individuals from Mexican population and compiled data from different ethnicities 
      showed discordant results concerning the hypothesis that SCA disease alleles 
      arise by expansion of large normal alleles.

AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) encompass a heterogeneous group of 
      rare diseases that affect the cerebellum and its connections. The most common 
      forms have been associated with dynamic mutations while some rarer forms with 
      conventional mutations. Studies in different populations revealed differences in 
      their relative frequencies both within and between the studied populations, 
      showing that the frequencies are depended on ethnic and geographical factors. 
      Previous investigation of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in the Cypriot population, revealed no 
      pathogenic expansion in the Cypriot SCA patients. We hereby present our recent 
      investigation of the SCA10 pentanucleotide repeat expansion. Forty-two 
      ascertained Cypriot sporadic ataxia patients, the index case from 1 ADCA and 14 
      ARCA families and a cohort of normal population individuals were included in the 
      study. All our patients have normal range ATXN10 gene ATTCT repeat numbers 
      (10-19). In the normal population group, repeat lengths ranged from 11 to 20 with 
      the 14 repeats allele being the most frequent. Therefore, all currently 
      established dynamic repeat SCA mutations are absent from the Cypriot population, 
      indicating distinct genetic causes.

AB  - The relative frequency of different autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, 
      commonly referred to as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), varies considerably among 
      populations of different ethnic origin. No data exist at present on the frequency 
      of different SCAs in the Greek population. In the present study we investigated 
      the presence of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in a cohort of 83 Greek patients with slowly 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia. Twenty patients came from autosomal dominant (AD) 
      pedigrees, seven displayed recessive or unclear inheritance and 56 were sporadic. 
      We found four patients with pathological SCA expansions, all from AD pedigrees. 
      Two patients had SCA1, one SCA2 and one SCA7 (10.0, 5.0 and 5.0% of the AD group, 
      respectively). The clinical features of these patients were within the expected 
      spectrum. In total, a pathological expansion was detected in 20% of patients from 
      AD pedigrees. Interestingly, no cases of SCA3 or SCA6 were detected in the AD 
      group. No expansions were found in other familial cases or in sporadic patients. 
      Overall, no cases of SCA3, SCA6, SCA12, SCA17 or DRPLA were identified in the 
      Greek population. In conclusion, SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 are present in Greek 
      patients with AD cerebellar ataxia in frequencies similar to those observed in 
      other populations. SCA3 and SCA6 appear however to be rare in Greece. The genetic 
      cause for the majority of AD ataxias remains to be identified.

PG  - 6
LID - 10.1186/1471-2199-13-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: RNA interference (RNAi) and antisense strategies provide experimental 
      therapeutic agents for numerous diseases, including polyglutamine (polyQ) 
      disorders caused by CAG repeat expansion. We compared the potential of different 
      oligonucleotide-based strategies for silencing the genes responsible for several 
      polyQ diseases, including Huntington's disease and two spinocerebellar ataxias, 
      type 1 and type 3. The strategies included nonallele-selective gene silencing, 
      gene replacement, allele-selective SNP targeting and CAG repeat targeting. 
      RESULTS: Using the patient-derived cell culture models of polyQ diseases, we 
      tested various siRNAs, and antisense reagents and assessed their silencing 
      efficiency and allele selectivity. We showed considerable allele discrimination 
      by several SNP targeting siRNAs based on a weak G-G or G-U pairing with normal 
      allele and strong G-C pairing with mutant allele at the site of RISC-induced 
      cleavage. Among the CAG repeat targeting reagents the strongest allele 
      discrimination is achieved by miRNA-like functioning reagents that bind to their 
      targets and inhibit their translation without substantial target cleavage. Also, 
      morpholino analog performs well in mutant and normal allele discrimination but 
      its efficient delivery to cells at low effective concentration still remains a 
      challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Using three cellular models of polyQ diseases and the 
      same experimental setup we directly compared the performance of different 
      oligonucleotide-based treatment strategies that are currently under development. 
      Based on the results obtained by us and others we discussed the advantages and 
      drawbacks of these strategies considering them from several different 
      perspectives. The strategy aimed at nonallele-selective inhibiting of causative 
      gene expression by targeting specific sequence of the implicated gene is the 
      easiest to implement but relevant benefits are still uncertain. The gene 
      replacement strategy that combines the nonallele-selective gene silencing with 
      the expression of the exogenous normal allele is a logical extension of the 
      former and it deserves to be explored further. Both allele-selective RNAi 
      approaches challenge cellular RNA interference machinery to show its ability to 
      discriminate between similar sequences differing in either single base 
      substitutions or repeated sequence length. Although both approaches perform well 
      in allele discrimination most of our efforts are focused on repeat targeting due 
      to its potentially higher universality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the presence of Machado-Joseph disease (MJD, also 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 [SCA3]) among Australian aborigines was caused by a 
      new mutational event or by the introduction of expanded alleles from other 
      populations. DESIGN: We sequenced a region of 4 kilobases (kb), encompassing the 
      CAG repeat within the ATXN3 gene, in 2 affected Australian aboriginal families 
      and compared them with the Joseph and Machado lineages described before. 
      Full-extended haplotypes (including also more distant single-nucleotide 
      polymorphisms and flanking short tandem repeats) were assessed by segregation and 
      allele-specific amplification. A phylogenetic tree was inferred from genetic 
      distances, and age of the Australasian Joseph-derived lineage was estimated. 
      SETTING: The aboriginal communities of Groote Eylandt and Yirrkala, in the 
      Northern Territories, Australia (local ethics institutional permission was 
      granted, and both community and individual informed consent was obtained). 
      SUBJECTS: A convenience sample of 19 patients and unaffected relatives, from 2 
      Australian aboriginal families affected with MJD; 40 families with MJD of 
      multiethnic origins and 50 unrelated Asian control subjects. RESULTS: The 2 
      aboriginal families shared the same full haplotype, including 20 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms:TTGATCGAGC-(CAG)(Exp)-CACCCAGCGC, that is, the 
      Joseph lineage with a G variant in rs56268847.Among 33 families with the Joseph 
      lineage, this derived haplotype was found only in 5 of 16 Taiwanese, all 3 
      Indian,and 1 of 3 Japanese families analyzed. CONCLUSION: A related-extended MJD 
      haplotype shared by Australian aborigines and some Asian families (a 
      Joseph-derived lineage) suggests a common ancestor for all, dating back more than 
      7000 years.

TI  - Parkinsonian phenotype in Machado-Joseph disease (MJD/SCA3): a two-case report.
PG  - 131
LID - 10.1186/1471-2377-11-131 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), or spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 
      (SCA3), is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder of late onset, which 
      is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of the ATXN3 gene. This 
      disease presents clinical heterogeneity, which cannot be completely explained by 
      the size of the repeat tract. MJD presents extrapyramidal motor signs, namely 
      parkinsonism, more frequently than the other subtypes of autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxias. Although parkinsonism seems to segregate within MJD families, 
      only a few MJD patients develop parkinsonian features and, therefore, the 
      clinical and genetic aspects of these rare presentations remain poorly 
      investigated. The main goal of this work was to describe two MJD patients 
      displaying the parkinsonian triad (tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity), namely on 
      what concerns genetic variation in Parkinson's disease (PD) associated loci 
      (PARK2, LRRK2, PINK1, DJ-1, SNCA, MAPT, APOE, and mtDNA tRNA(Gln) T4336C). CASE 
      PRESENTATION: Patient 1 is a 40 year-old female (onset at 30 years of age), 
      initially with a pure parkinsonian phenotype (similar to the phenotype previously 
      reported for her mother). Patient 2 is a 38 year-old male (onset at 33 years of 
      age), presenting an ataxic phenotype with parkinsonian features (not seen either 
      in other affected siblings or in his father). Both patients presented an expanded 
      ATXN3 allele with 72 CAG repeats. No PD mutations were found in the analyzed 
      loci. However, allelic variants previously associated with PD were observed in 
      DJ-1 and APOE genes, for both patients. CONCLUSIONS: The present report adds 
      clinical and genetic information on this particular and rare MJD presentation, 
      and raises the hypothesis that DJ-1 and APOE polymorphisms may confer 
      susceptibility to the parkinsonian phenotype in MJD.

AB  - To date there are 9 known diseases caused by an expanded polyglutamine repeat, 
      with the most prevalent being Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease is a 
      progressive autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder for which currently no 
      therapy is available. It is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the HTT gene, 
      which results in an expansion of a glutamine stretch at the N-terminal end of the 
      huntingtin protein. This polyglutamine expansion plays a central role in the 
      disease and results in the accumulation of cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates. 
      Here, we make use of modified 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate (CUG)n triplet-repeat 
      antisense oligonucleotides to effectively reduce mutant huntingtin transcript and 
      protein levels in patient-derived Huntington's disease fibroblasts and 
      lymphoblasts. The most effective antisense oligonucleotide, (CUG)(7), also 
      reduced mutant ataxin-1 and ataxin-3 mRNA levels in spinocerebellar ataxia 1 and 
      3, respectively, and atrophin-1 in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy patient 
      derived fibroblasts. This antisense oligonucleotide is not only a promising 
      therapeutic tool to reduce mutant huntingtin levels in Huntington's disease but 
      our results in spinocerebellar ataxia and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      cells suggest that this could also be applicable to other polyglutamine expansion 
      disorders as well.

TI  - Brain stem and cerebellum volumetric analysis of Machado Joseph disease patients.
PG  - 292-6
LID - S0004-282X2011000300005 [pii]
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease, or spinocerebellar ataxia type 3(MJD/SCA3), is the most 
      frequent late onset spinocerebellar ataxia and results from a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the ataxin-3 gene. Previous studies have found correlation between 
      atrophy of cerebellum and brainstem with age and CAG repeats, although no such 
      correlation has been found with disease duration and clinical manifestations. In 
      this study we test the hypothesis that atrophy of cerebellum and brainstem in 
      MJD/SCA3 is related to clinical severity, disease duration and CAG repeat length 
      as well as to other variables such as age and ICARS (International Cooperative 
      Ataxia Rating Scale). Whole brain high resolution MRI and volumetric measurement 
      with cranial volume normalization were obtained from 15 MJD/SCA3 patients and 15 
      normal, age and sex-matchedcontrols. We applied ICARS and compared the score with 
      volumes and CAG number, disease duration and age. We found significant 
      correlation of both brain stem and cerebellar atrophy with CAG repeat length, 
      age, disease duration and degree of disability. The Spearman rank correlation was 
      stronger with volumetric reduction of the cerebellum than with brain stem. Our 
      data allow us to conclude that volumetric analysis might reveal progressive 
      degeneration after disease onset, which in turn is linked to both age and number 
      of CAG repeat expansions in SCA 3.

TI  - Evaluating the prevalence of polyglutamine repeat expansions in amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis.
PG  - 2062-5
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0b013e31821f4447 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Given the recent finding of an association between intermediate-length 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) expansions in ataxin 2 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (ALS), we sought to determine whether expansions in other polyQ disease genes 
      were associated with ALS. METHODS: We assessed the polyQ lengths of ataxin 1, 
      ataxin 3, ataxin 6, ataxin 7, TBP, atrophin 1, and huntingtin in several hundred 
      patients with sporadic ALS and healthy controls. RESULTS: Other than ataxin 2, we 
      did not identify a significant association with the other polyQ genes and ALS. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the effects of ataxin 2 polyQ expansions on 
      ALS risk are likely to be rooted in the biology of ataxin 2 or ataxin 2-specific 
      interactions, rather than the presence of an expanded polyQ repeat per se. These 
      findings have important consequences for understanding the role of ataxin 2 in 
      ALS pathogenesis and provide a framework for future mechanistic studies.

AB  - In polyglutamine disorders, the length of the expanded CAG repeat shows a strong 
      inverse correlation with the age at disease onset, yet up to 50% of the variation 
      in age of onset is determined by other additional factors. Here, we investigated 
      whether variations in the expression of heat shock proteins (HSP) are related to 
      differences in the age of onset in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)3. 
      Hereto, we analysed the protein expression levels of HSPA1A (HSP70), HSPA8 
      (HSC70), DNAJB (HSP40) and HSPB1 (HSP27) in fibroblasts from patients and healthy 
      controls. HSPB1 levels were significantly upregulated in fibroblasts from 
      patients with SCA3, but without relation to age of onset. Exclusively for 
      expression of DNAJB family members, a correlation was found with the age of onset 
      independent of the length of the CAG repeat expansion. This indicates that DNAJB 
      members might be contributors to the variation in age of onset and underlines the 
      possible use of DNAJB proteins as therapeutic targets.

TI  - Involvement of Onuf's nucleus in Machado-Joseph disease: a morphometric and 
      immunohistochemical study.
PG  - 439-48
LID - 10.1007/s00401-010-0699-5 [doi]
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in the MJD1 gene, in which lower urinary 
      tract dysfunction is known to be the most commonly encountered autonomic failure. 
      However, it remains unclear whether Onuf's nucleus (ON), which plays major roles 
      in the micturition reflex and voluntary continence, degenerates during the 
      disease process. In the present study, we conducted a morphometric and 
      immunohistochemical study of ON, together with the lateral nuclear group (LNG) of 
      the sacral anterior horns, in seven patients with MJD. When compared with 
      controls, the number of lower motor neurons in both ON and LNG was significantly 
      smaller in the MJD patients, the former being inversely correlated with the size 
      of the expanded CAG repeats. Notably, MJD patients with a large CAG-repeat 
      expansion showed an ON-predominant pattern of neuronal loss, while in the 
      remaining patients, ON and LNG were affected to a similar degree, or rather an 
      LNG-predominant pattern of neuronal loss was evident. Moreover, when adjusted for 
      age, the degree of neuronal loss in both ON and LNG was significantly correlated 
      with the extent of expansion of the CAG repeats. In MJD, the remaining lower 
      motor neurons in ON often exhibited ataxin-3- or 1C2-immunoreactive (ir) neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusions, while no pTDP-43-ir neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions were 
      present in these neurons. In conclusion, the present findings strongly suggest 
      that neuronal loss in ON, the degree of which is highly influenced by the extent 
      of expansion of CAG repeats, is a consistent feature in MJD.

AB  - Small heat-shock proteins (sHsps) are molecular chaperones that play an important 
      protective role against cellular protein misfolding by interacting with partially 
      unfolded proteins on their off-folding pathway, preventing their aggregation. 
      Polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion leads to the formation of fibrillar 
      protein aggregates and neuronal cell death in nine diseases, including Huntington 
      disease and the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). There is evidence that sHsps have 
      a role in suppression of polyQ-induced neurodegeneration; for example, the sHsp 
      alphaB-crystallin (alphaB-c) has been identified as a suppressor of SCA3 toxicity 
      in a Drosophila model. However, the molecular mechanism for this suppression is 
      unknown. In this study we tested the ability of alphaB-c to suppress the 
      aggregation of a polyQ protein. We found that alphaB-c does not inhibit the 
      formation of SDS-insoluble polyQ fibrils. We further tested the effect of 
      alphaB-c on the aggregation of ataxin-3, a polyQ protein that aggregates via a 
      two-stage aggregation mechanism. The first stage involves association of the 
      N-terminal Josephin domain followed by polyQ-mediated interactions and the 
      formation of SDS-resistant mature fibrils. Our data show that alphaB-c potently 
      inhibits the first stage of ataxin-3 aggregation; however, the second 
      polyQ-dependent stage can still proceed. By using NMR spectroscopy, we have 
      determined that alphaB-c interacts with an extensive region on the surface of the 
      Josephin domain. These data provide an example of a domain/region flanking an 
      amyloidogenic sequence that has a critical role in modulating aggregation of a 
      polypeptide and plays a role in the interaction with molecular chaperones to 
      prevent this aggregation.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 is an untreatable CAG repeat expansion disorder whose 
      natural history is not completely understood. Our aims were to describe the 
      progression of neurological manifestations in a long-term cohort of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 3, and to verify if CAG expanded repeat, gender, and age 
      at onset were associated with the rate of progression. Patients entered the study 
      between 1998 and 2005 and were seen until 2007. On each visit, the validated 
      NESSCA scale, an inventory of 18 neurological manifestations, was applied. Scores 
      observed in each year of disease duration produced a Growth Curve, which was 
      analyzed through the random coefficients model. Scores obtained in some 
      individual items were described through multi-state Markov models. One hundred 
      fifty-six patients (78 families) were recruited; 28 were lost, and 23 died. Mean 
      (sd) ages at onset and at baseline were 32.8 (10.6) and 40.7 (12.8) years; median 
      (range) expanded CAGn was 74 (67-85). Three hundred fifteen NESSCA evaluations 
      were performed, comprising disease durations from zero to 34 years. The 105 
      patients who completed the study were seen over 5 (sd = 2.4) years at intervals 
      of 2.5 (sd = 1.5) years. The trajectory of NESSCA obtained for the overall group 
      increased by 1.26 points per year. This slope increased by 0.15 points per each 
      additional CAG in the expanded repeat (p < 0.0002) and decreased by 0.03 points 
      per each additional year of age at onset (p = 0.005). NESSCA worsened steadily, 
      producing linear trajectories, which were faster among patients with longer 
      expanded repeats (>74) and with lower ages at onset (<34 years).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), caused by a CAG repeat expansion 
      located in exon10 of the ATXN3 gene, is now regarded as one of the most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) in the world. The relative frequency of MJD among 
      SCA has previously been estimated at about 50% in the Chinese population and has 
      been reported to be related to the frequency of large normal alleles in some 
      populations. Taq polymerase has been used for PCR in nearly all studies reported 
      previously. METHODS: Normal and expanded alleles of ATXN3 were detected via PCR 
      using LA Taq DNA polymerase (better for GC-rich sequences) and denaturing 
      polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 150 normal individuals and 138 unrelated 
      probands from autosomal dominant SCA families. To compare reaction efficiency, 12 
      MJD patients' expanded alleles were amplified with La Taq and Taq polymerase 
      respectively in the same amplifying systems and reaction conditions. RESULTS: 
      Normal alleles ranged from 12 to 42 CAG repeats. The most common allele contained 
      14 repeats with a frequency of 23.3%, which corroborates previous reports. The 
      frequency of large normal alleles (>27 repeats) was 0.28, which was very high 
      relative to previous reports. The frequency of MJD in SCA patients was 72.5%, 
      which was significantly higher than those in previous reports about the Chinese 
      and other Asian populations. This frequency was one of the highest reported 
      worldwide, with only Portuguese and Brazilian populations exhibiting higher 
      proportions. All 12 expanded alleles were amplified in PCR with La Taq 
      polymerase, whereas only 2 expanded alleles were amplified with Taq polymerase. 
      CONCLUSION: We have first reported the highest relative frequency of MJD in Asia, 
      and we attribute this high frequency to a more efficient PCR using LA Taq 
      polymerase and hypothesized that large ANs may act as a reservoir for expanded 
      alleles in the Southeastern Chinese population.

AB  - We report on a Chinese family with three members who have CAG repeat expansion in 
      the ataxin-3, two members present with expanded trinucleotide repeat in both the 
      ataxin-3 and tata-binding protein (TBP) and an individual who carries expanded 
      CAG/CAA repeat in the TBP. Only the patients who carry an allele with expansion 
      in the ataxin-3 gene presented with clinical symptoms. This interesting family 
      presents a unique mutation state. We will continue to track this family in the 
      future, which may help us further elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 3 and 17. The study also provides us a novel 
      conception that mutations from two pathogenetic genes may coexist in one patient 
      and SCA-affected patients with intermediate allele need to be further excluded 
      for other SCA subtypes.

AB  - The diagnosis and incidence of spinocerebelar ataxias (SCA) is sometimes 
      difficult to analyze due the overlap of phenotypes subtypes and are disorders of 
      mutations caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion. To investigate the 
      incidence of the SCA in Southern Brazil, we analyzed the trinucleotide repeats 
      (CAG)n at the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7 loci to identify allele size ranges 
      and frequencies. We examined blood sample from 154 asymptomatic blood donors and 
      115 individuals with progressive ataxias. PCR products were submitted to 
      capillary electrophoresis. In the blood donors, the ranges of the five loci were: 
      SCA1, 19 to 36 (CAG)n; SCA2, 6 to 28 (CAG)n; SCA3, 12 to 34 (CAG)n; SCA6, 2 to 13 
      (CAG)n; and SCA7, 2 to 10 (CAG)n. No deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
      were detected. In the ataxia group, we found (CAG)n above the range of the 
      asymptomatic blood donors in SCA3 (21.74%) followed by SCA2 (5.22%), SCA7 
      (2.61%), SCA6 (0.87%), and no cases of SCA1. The remaining 80 cases (69.56%) have 
      different diagnoses from the type here studied. These data defined the alleles 
      and their frequencies, as well as demonstrated their stability in the population 
      not affected. The molecular diagnosis test confirmed the clinical diagnosis in 
      28/45 cases and classified another 7/70 from the clinical unclassified ataxias 
      group.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathy (PN) has long been recognized in Machado-Joseph disease 
      (MJD), but its natural history is an unsettled issue. Therefore, we prospectively 
      assessed 40 with MJD for 13 months with nerve conduction (NC) studies and the 
      revised total neuropathy score (TNSr) to study the progression of PN. There was 
      no significant change in the TNSr score over the follow-up period. In contrast, 
      the average sural sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude decreased 
      significantly over the same interval from a mean of 13.2 muV to 9.8 muV (P < 
      0.001). There was an inverse correlation between the change in the sural SNAP 
      amplitude and the length of the CAG triplet repeat expansion (r = 0.574, P < 
      0.001). The reduction in the mean sural SNAP amplitude also correlated with 
      progression of ataxia. This indicates that PN progresses faster in individuals 
      with larger (CAG)(n) expansions, and nerve conduction studies may be useful to 
      study disease progression in MJD.

AB  - To investigate the prevalence and clinical feature(s) of Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      patients with expanded (ATXN2 and MJD1) genes of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      and 3 (SCA2 and SCA3/MJD) in a mainland Chinese population, CAG triplet repeat 
      expansions of (SCA2 and SCA3/MJD) genes (ATXN2 and MJD1) were analyzed in a 
      cohort of 452 PD patients, including 386 sporadic and 66 familial forms. Striatal 
      dopamine transporter was evaluated in two SCA2 and two SCA3/MJD-positive family 
      members, an idiopathic PD patient and a healthy control using carbon (C11) 
      [(11)C]-radiolabeled-CFT positron emission tomography (PET). We found two 
      patients in one familial PD (FPD) family (1.5%) and two sporadic PD patients 
      (0.5%) with expanded CAG repeats in the ATXN2 locus, four patients in two FPD 
      families (3%) and another three sporadic PD patients (0.8%) in the MJD1 locus. 
      [(11)C]-CFT PET in detected members in SCA2 and SCA3/MJD families showed 
      decrements of (11)C-CFT uptake. These findings suggest that a mutation in SCA2 or 
      SCA3/MJD may be one of the genetic causes of PD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is an 
      autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by cerebellar ataxia 
      associated with varying phenotypic variability. It was reported that a few of 
      SCA3/MJD patients showed marked spastic paraplegia with or without cerebellar 
      ataxia, which was partially first diagnosed as hereditary spastic paraplegia 
      (HSP) and considered to be a new subtype (subtype V). But the data in China is 
      still absent. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mutation frequency and clinical 
      features of subtype V of SCA3/MJD in Chinese patients with HSP. METHODS: Mutation 
      detection of MJD1 gene was carried out in 46 AD-HSP families and 58 sporadic 
      cases. RESULTS: Expanded CAG repeats that ranged from 64 to 81 of MJD1 gene were 
      found in six probands from 46 AD-HSP families (13%, 6/46). No abnormal repeat 
      expansion was found in sporadic cases (0/58). The initial symptoms of six SCA3 
      cases were all spasticity in the lower limbs, and nystagmus, dysphagia and 
      dysarthria that occurred with disease progression seemed more frequent than HSP. 
      CONCLUSION: Subtype V of SCA3/MJD is not rare in China, but it is hard to 
      distinguish between HSP and SCA3/MJD only by clinical manifestation and MRI, and 
      MJD1 gene should be detected routinely in the patients diagnosed as HSP in 
      clinic.

LID - e5834
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3, also known as Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD), is one 
      of many inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by polyglutamine-encoding 
      CAG repeat expansions in otherwise unrelated genes. Disease protein misfolding 
      and aggregation, often within the nucleus of affected neurons, characterize 
      polyglutamine disorders. Several evidences have implicated the nucleus as the 
      primary site of pathogenesis for MJD. However, the molecular determinants for the 
      nucleocytoplasmic transport of human ataxin-3 (Atx3), the protein which is 
      mutated in patients with MJD, are not characterized. In order to characterize the 
      nuclear shuttling activity of Atx3, we performed yeast nuclear import assays and 
      found that Atx3 is actively imported into the nucleus, by means of a classical 
      nuclear localizing sequence formed by a cluster of lysine and arginine residues. 
      On the other hand, when active nuclear export was inhibited using leptomycin B, a 
      specific inhibitor of the nuclear export receptor CRM1, both endogenous Atx3 and 
      transfected GFP-Atx3 accumulated inside the nucleus of a subpopulation of COS-7 
      cells, whereas both proteins are normally predominant in the cytoplasm. 
      Additionally, using a Rev(1.4)-GFP nuclear export assay, we performed an 
      extensive analysis of six putative aliphatic nuclear export motifs identified in 
      Atx3 amino acid sequence. Although none of the tested peptide sequences were 
      found to drive nuclear export when isolated, we have successfully mapped the 
      region of Atx3 responsible for its CRM1-independent nuclear export activity. 
      Curiously, the N-terminal Josephin domain alone is exported into the cytoplasm, 
      but the nuclear export activity of Atx3 is significantly enhanced in a longer 
      construct that is truncated after the two ubiquitin interaction motifs, upstream 
      from the polyQ tract. Our data show that Atx3 is actively imported to and 
      exported from the cell nucleus, and that its nuclear export activity is dependent 
      on a motif located at its N-terminal region. Since pathological Atx3 aggregates 
      in the nucleus of affected neurons in MJD, and there is in vivo evidence that 
      nuclear localization of Atx3 is required for the manifestation of symptoms in 
      MJD, defects in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity of the protein may be 
      involved in the nuclear accumulation and aggregation of expanded Atx3.

TI  - Mitochondrial tRNALeu/Lys and ATPase 6/8 gene variations in spinocerebellar 
      ataxias.
PG  - 16-22
LID - 10.1159/000170885 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) comprise a heterogeneous group of 
      severe late-onset neurodegenerative diseases that are promoted by the expansion 
      of a tandem-arrayed DNA sequence that modifies the primary structure of the 
      protein. METHODS: Genomic DNA of 20 patients affected with SCAs was extracted 
      from peripheral blood and screened for deletions in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). 
      Sequencing of tRNA(Leu), tRNA(Lys), cytochrome oxidase II, ATPase 6/8 and NADH 
      dehydrogenase I (NDI) genes belonging to mtDNA from patients with SCAs was also 
      carried out to detect the presence of variations. RESULTS: We identified 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeat expansions in 20 patients. 
      Seven of these patients had at least one nucleotide change in mtDNA. In such 
      cases, 5 nucleotide variations resulted in amino acid changes with two novel 
      variations T8256G and G9010A. CONCLUSION: SCA patients showed high levels of 
      mtDNA variations in lymphocytes. It can be proposed that the SCA gene proteins 
      (Ataxins) are involved in the complicated intracellular mechanisms that affect 
      cellular organelles and their components, such as the mitochondrial genome. The 
      instability of CAG repeats in polyglutamine diseases such as SCAs and 
      Huntington's disease might be a causative factor in mtDNA variation or possible 
      damage.

TI  - RNA toxicity is a component of ataxin-3 degeneration in Drosophila.
PG  - 1107-11

AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a class of dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative disorders caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat encoding 
      glutamine within the coding region of the respective genes. The molecular and 
      cellular pathways underlying polyQ-induced neurodegeneration are the focus of 
      much research, and it is widely considered that toxic activities of the protein, 
      resulting from the abnormally long polyQ tract, cause pathogenesis. Here we 
      provide evidence for a pathogenic role of the CAG repeat RNA in polyQ toxicity 
      using Drosophila. In a Drosophila screen for modifiers of polyQ degeneration 
      induced by the spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) protein ataxin-3, we isolated 
      an upregulation allele of muscleblind (mbl), a gene implicated in the RNA 
      toxicity of CUG expansion diseases. Further analysis indicated that there may be 
      a toxic role of the RNA in polyQ-induced degeneration. We tested the role of the 
      RNA by altering the CAG repeat sequence to an interrupted CAACAG repeat within 
      the polyQ-encoding region; this dramatically mitigated toxicity. In addition, 
      expression of an untranslated CAG repeat of pathogenic length conferred neuronal 
      degeneration. These studies reveal a role for the RNA in polyQ toxicity, 
      highlighting common components in RNA-based and polyQ-protein-based trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion diseases.

TI  - Muscle excitability abnormalities in Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 525-9
LID - 10.1001/archneur.65.4.525 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the frequency of and to characterize muscle excitability 
      abnormalities in Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). DESIGN: Machado-Joseph disease is 
      a common autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia caused by an unstable CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion. Muscle cramps and fasciculations are frequent and 
      sometimes disabling manifestations. However, their frequency and 
      pathophysiological mechanisms remain largely unknown. Symptomatic patients with 
      MJD (hereinafter MJD patients) with molecular confirmation were assessed 
      prospectively. A standard questionnaire addressing clinical features of muscle 
      cramps and fasciculations was used. The Cramps Disability Scale was used to 
      quantify cramps-related disability. Patients underwent neurophysiological testing 
      with routine techniques. F waves of the right median nerves were obtained, and 
      persistence indexes were calculated. Four muscles (deltoid, first dorsal 
      interossei, tibialis anterior, and vastus lateralis) were examined by needle 
      electromyography. A semiquantitative scale (from 0 [no activity] to 4 [continuous 
      activity]) was used to determine the frequency of rest fasciculations in each 
      muscle. RESULTS: Fifty MJD patients (29 men) were included in the study. Their 
      mean age at examination was 46.3 years, their mean age at onset of the disease 
      was 35 years, and the mean duration of disease was 11.2 years. Abnormal CAG(n) 
      varied from 59 to 75 repeats. Forty-one patients presented with muscle cramps; in 
      10, this was their first symptom. The frequency of cramps varied between 1 and 90 
      episodes a week. For 15 patients, cramps were the chief complaint, frequently 
      disturbing sleep or work (Cramps Disability Scale score, 2 or 3). Lower limbs 
      were affected in 37 individuals, but unusual regions, such as the face and 
      abdominal muscles, were also involved. Fasciculations were found in 25 
      individuals; in 8 patients, they included facial muscles. However, fasciculations 
      were not a significant complaint for any of these patients. The clinical and 
      neurophysiological profile of MJD patients with and without cramps was not 
      significantly different. However, MJD patients with fasciculations had more 
      severe damage to their peripheral nerves. CONCLUSIONS: Muscle excitability 
      abnormalities were found in 41 MJD patients (82%), and they were the presenting 
      complaint in 10 (20%). They are related to altered excitability of peripheral 
      motor axons, but mechanisms underlying cramps and fasciculations are possibly 
      distinct in MJD patients.

TI  - Striatal and nigral pathology in a lentiviral rat model of Machado-Joseph 
      disease.
PG  - 2071-83
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddn106 [doi]
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is a fatal, dominant neurodegenerative disorder. MJD 
      results from polyglutamine repeat expansion in the MJD-1 gene, conferring a toxic 
      gain of function to the ataxin-3 protein. In this study, we aimed at 
      overexpressing ataxin-3 in the rat brain using lentiviral vectors (LV), to 
      generate an in vivo MJD genetic model and, to study the disorder in defined brain 
      regions: substantia nigra, an area affected in MJD, cortex and striatum, regions 
      not previously reported to be affected in MJD. LV encoding mutant or wild-type 
      human ataxin-3 was injected in the brain of adult rats and the animals were 
      tested for behavioral deficits and neuropathological abnormalities. Striatal 
      pathology was confirmed in transgenic mice and human tissue. In substantia nigra, 
      unilateral overexpression of mutant ataxin-3 led to: apomorphine-induced turning 
      behavior; formation of ubiquitinated ataxin-3 aggregates; alpha-synuclein 
      immunoreactivity; and loss of dopaminergic markers (TH and VMAT2). No 
      neuropathological changes were observed upon wild-type ataxin-3 overexpression. 
      Mutant ataxin-3 expression in striatum and cortex, resulted in accumulation of 
      misfolded ataxin-3, and within striatum, loss of neuronal markers. Striatal 
      pathology was confirmed by observation in MJD transgenic mice of ataxin-3 
      aggregates and substantial reduction of DARPP-32 immunoreactivity and, in human 
      striata, by ataxin-3 inclusions, immunoreactive for ubiquitin and 
      alpha-synuclein. This study demonstrates the use of LV encoding mutant ataxin-3 
      to produce a model of MJD and brings evidence of striatal pathology, suggesting 
      that this region may contribute to dystonia and chorea observed in some MJD 
      patients and may represent a target for therapies.

TI  - DNA-labelled cytidine assay for the quantification of CAG repeats.
PG  - 201-7
LID - 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2007.10.020 [doi]
AB  - The sequencing procedure has been used to determine the size of the CAG repeat 
      expansion for the diagnosis of genetic disorders. Likewise, standard polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) and gel electrophoresis techniques are applied for screening 
      large number of patients. The trinucleotide repeats (TNR) region amplification by 
      means of the PCR procedure was initially performed using 32-P end-labelled 
      primers and currently carried out with fluorescently end-labelled primers. The 
      goal to obtain reliable TNR quantification assays, at low cost and short assay 
      times, represents a challenge for the molecular diagnosis aimed at massive 
      screening of affected populations. In the current work, we obtained preliminary 
      results of a new methodology for the detection and size estimation of CAG 
      expanded alleles. The assay was based on an indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent 
      assay (ELISA) for quantifying the amount of labelled cytidines in DNA molecules. 
      The label, 6-(p-bromobenzamido)caproyl radical, was introduced by the 
      transamination and acylation reactions. A group of model sequences containing 
      different numbers of CAG repeats, as well as the ATXN3 (ataxin 3) gene (from 
      subjects suffering type 3 spinocerebellar ataxia SCA3) were used for assay 
      standardization. The assay is simple, inexpensive, and easy to perform and 
      differentiates distinct degrees of CAG expansions.

TI  - Molecular analysis of CAG repeats at five different spinocerebellar ataxia loci: 
      correlation and alternative explanations for disease pathogenesis.
PG  - 338-42
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are caused by expansion of (CAG)n triplet repeats. 
      These repeats occur as polymorphic forms in general population; however, beyond a 
      threshold size they become pathogenic. The sizes and distributions of repeats at 
      the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA7 and DRPLA loci were assessed by molecular analysis of 
      124 unrelated ataxia patients and 44 controls, and the association of larger 
      normal (LN) alleles with disease prevalence was evaluated. Triplet repeat 
      expansions in the disease range were detected in 8% (10/124) of the cases, with 
      the majority having expansion at the SCA1 locus. Normal allele ranges in the 
      cohort studied were similar to the Caucasian and North Indian populations but 
      differed from the Korean and Japanese populations at various loci. The percentage 
      of individuals with LN alleles at the SCA1 and SCA2 loci was higher than reported 
      in Indians, Japanese and Caucasians. LN alleles showed a good correlation with 
      the incidence of SCA1, indicating that SCA1 is the most prevalent ataxia in our 
      population. The majority of cases with clinical symptoms of SCA could not be 
      diagnosed by established CAG repeat criteria, suggesting that there may be an 
      alternative basis for disease pathogenesis: (i) Repeats lower than the normal 
      range may also result in abnormal phenotypes (ii) LN alleles at different loci in 
      the same individual may contribute to symptoms (iii) Exogenous factors may play a 
      role in triggering disease symptoms in individuals with LN alleles (iv) Triplet 
      repeats may reach the disease range in the brain but not in the blood.

TI  - Chronic pain in Machado-Joseph disease: a frequent and disabling symptom.
PG  - 1767-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is one of the most common forms of 
      neurodegenerative ataxia characterized by remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity. 
      Although patients frequently report pain, systematic evaluation of this clinical 
      feature is lacking. OBJECTIVES: To compare the frequency of chronic pain among 
      patients with genetically confirmed MJD, an age- and sex-matched healthy control 
      group, and a disease control group of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (ALS). METHODS: We included 70 patients with MJD, 20 patients with ALS, and 70 
      control subjects from 2 clinical centers. All individuals underwent assessment 
      with a standardized pain questionnaire. In addition, we used a visual analog 
      scale to quantify pain intensity. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients with MJD (47%), 
      3 patients with ALS (15%), and 6 controls (9%) reported chronic pain. Lower back 
      pain preceded ataxia in 6 patients with MJD. Twenty-nine patients with MJD had 
      daily pain, which was continuous in 23. The mean visual analog scale score was 
      6.1 in patients with MJD. Pain was musculoskeletal in 26 patients with MJD, 
      dystonic in 2, neuropathic in 2, and mixed in 3. Typically, pain was lumbar (n = 
      17) or in the lower limbs (n = 15). We did not find significant differences 
      regarding duration of disease, sex, or severity of ataxia among patients with MJD 
      with and without chronic pain. Expanded (CAG)(n) tandem repeats were longer in 
      patients with MJD who experienced chronic pain (67.3 vs 65.2; P = .04). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In our series, pain was significantly more frequent in patients with 
      MJD than in controls. Chronic pain was a frequent and often disabling complaint 
      among patients with MJD. The lower back was the most frequently reported location 
      of pain in patients with MJD.

TI  - Case control analysis of repeat expansion size in ataxia.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurological diseases. The expansion of unstable microsatellite 
      repeats has been identified as the underlying pathogenic cause of 10 subtypes of 
      autosomal dominant SCAs. The aetiology of sporadic SCA is unknown. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effect of large normal repeats in patients 
      presenting with sporadic or familial ataxia compared to a control population. The 
      size of the expansion was determined using a fluorescent PCR approach in 10 
      common SCA genes: SCA-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 (CACNA1A), 
      SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), SCA-17 (TBP) 
      and DRPLA (ATN1), in 165 ataxia patients and 307 controls of Welsh origin. There 
      was no difference between cases and controls in the distribution of the large 
      normal alleles, or in the distribution of the combined CAG repeats. The normal 
      allele distribution in the Welsh population was largely similar to that of other 
      Caucasian populations. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of large normal 
      repeats on the susceptibility to develop ataxia.

TI  - Cis-acting factors promoting the CAG intergenerational instability in 
      Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 439-46
AB  - In repeat expansion disorders, the size of pathological alleles is the most 
      relevant factor accounting for the disease severity and age-at-onset, emphasizing 
      the clinical significance of their underlying intergenerational instability. In 
      one of these diseases, Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), the sex of transmitting 
      progenitor and the C(987)GG/G(987)GG polymorphism are the best studied factors 
      acting on intergenerational instability of expanded alleles. Here, we assessed 
      the influence of other cis and inter-allelic acting factors, at the ATXN3 locus, 
      through the analysis of MJD lineages, flanking STR-based haplotypes, the initial 
      repeat size and parental age. A total of 100 transmissions of the expanded MJD 
      allele were analyzed according to the sex of the transmitting parent. We have 
      shown that independent origin mutations (identified by intragenic SNP-based 
      haplotypes) behave differently, as the status of instability (contraction, no 
      change or further expansion) is concerned. Indeed, 72% of expansions were 
      associated to the worldwide spread TTACAC lineage, whereas the GTGGCA displayed 
      75% of all contractions observed. The analysis of flanking recombinant haplotypes 
      did not suggest any further distant cis elements acting up- or downstream the 
      ATXN3 locus. Considering the increased amplitude of expansions seen in older 
      transmitting fathers, a repair-based mechanism may be suggested for the meiotic 
      instability at this locus; furthermore, the lack of correlation between the 
      initial repeat size and degree of instability did not support a replication-based 
      mechanism. In summary, our findings point to different mechanisms of instability 
      underlying male and female meioses, as well as contraction and expansion 
      processes in MJD.

PG  - 1971-4
AB  - Anecdotal reports suggest that patients with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA 2) 
      patients can present with postural tremor with ataxia. We determined the 
      prevalence of SCA2 and SCA3 mutations in a cohort of ET and atypical Parkinsonism 
      patients. A total of 277 subjects comprising of 177 ET and 100 atypical 
      Parkinsonism were examined. We identified one positive case of SCA3 among those 
      who were diagnosed with ET, yielding a prevalence of 0.5%, but a zero prevalence 
      among our atypical Parkinsonism patients. No study subjects carried an abnormal 
      SCA2 repeat expansion. Our study highlights that SCA3 can present initially with 
      ET symptoms, expanding the spectrum of genetic diseases that can be associated 
      with ET-like phenotype. Routine screening for SCA2 and SCA3 in ET and atypical 
      Parkinsonism patients may not be cost effective. However, in the long-term 
      follow-up of patients who present with an ET phenotype, clinicians should be 
      vigilant for other neurological signs, which may be point to an alternate 
      diagnosis.

TI  - Lack of mutations in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 and 3 genes in a Taiwanese 
      (ethnic Chinese) cohort of familial and early-onset parkinsonism.
PG  - 434-8
AB  - Recent reports suggest that CAG triplet expansions of spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      2 and 3 (SCA2 and SCA3) genes are the cause of typical levodopa-responsive 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) in familial cases, several of which were ethnic Chinese. 
      To investigate the role of SCA2 and SCA3 mutations in Chinese familial and 
      early-onset PD patients, we analyzed CAG triplet repeat expansions of SCA2 and 
      SCA3 genes in a cohort of 73 Taiwanese/Ethnic Chinese familial and early-onset PD 
      patients [mean age at onset 42.70 +/- 7.17 years (mean +/- SD)]. Thirteen of them 
      (17.8%) had positive family history. All patients received comprehensive clinical 
      evaluation including a thorough neurological examination, laboratory tests, and 
      neuroimaging studies to exclude secondary causes and atypical parkinsonism. The 
      CAG repeat length in these genes was determined using polymerase chain reaction 
      polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. SCA2 gene CAG repeats ranged from 15 to 26 
      repeats with a median of 20, and SCA3 gene CAG repeats ranged from 15 to 40 with 
      a median of 15. No long pathogenic repeats were found in either SCA2 or SCA3, 
      although borderline CAG repeat number was detected in the SCA3 gene of four 
      patients. Thus, mutations of SCA2 or SCA3 did not play a major role in familial 
      or early-onset PD in our study cohort. PD patients without autosomal dominant 
      family history or obvious cerebellar ataxia should not be candidates for routine 
      screening of SCA2 or SCA3 mutations for cost-effectiveness.

TI  - Multiplex families with multiple system atrophy.
PG  - 545-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) has been considered a sporadic disease, 
      without patterns of inheritance. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of 
      4 multiplex families with MSA, including clinical genetic aspects. DESIGN: 
      Clinical and genetic study. SETTING: Four departments of neurology in Japan. 
      Patients Eight patients in 4 families with parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and 
      autonomic failure with age at onset ranging from 58 to 72 years. Two siblings in 
      each family were affected with these conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical 
      evaluation was performed according to criteria by Gilman et al. Trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the responsible genes for the spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 
      series and for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) was evaluated by 
      polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequence analysis of coding regions in the 
      alpha-synuclein gene was performed. RESULTS: Consanguineous marriage was observed 
      in 1 of 4 families. Among 8 patients, 1 had definite MSA, 5 had probable MSA, and 
      2 had possible MSA. The most frequent phenotype was MSA with predominant 
      parkinsonism, observed in 5 patients. Six patients showed pontine atrophy with 
      cross sign or slitlike signal change at the posterolateral putaminal margin or 
      both on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Possibilities of hereditary ataxias, 
      including SCA1 (ataxin 1, ATXN1), SCA2 (ATXN2), Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3 
      (ATXN1), SCA6 (ATXN1), SCA7 (ATXN7), SCA12 (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory 
      subunit B, beta isoform; PP2R2B), SCA17 (TATA box binding protein, TBP) and DRPLA 
      (atrophin 1; ATN1), were excluded, and no mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene 
      were found. CONCLUSIONS: Findings in these multiplex families suggest the 
      presence of familial MSA with autosomal recessive inheritance and a genetic 
      predisposition to MSA. Molecular genetic approaches focusing on familial MSA are 
      expected to provide clues to the pathogenesis of MSA.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat dynamic mutation identifying susceptibility in familial and 
      sporadic chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.
PG  - 73-9
AB  - Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) has a strong hereditary component, but an 
      understanding of predisposition genes is poor. Anticipation with familial CLL has 
      been reported, although the molecular mechanism is unknown. Expansion of 
      trinucleotide repeat sequences underlies anticipation observed in 
      neurodegenerative disease. A polymerase chain reaction-based assay was used to 
      analyse the stability of ten CCG- and CAG-trinucleotide repeat tracts in 18 CLL 
      families and 140 patients with the sporadic form of the disease. The study 
      suggests that anticipation, if it occurs in CLL, is not linked to CCG- and 
      CAG-repeat expansion, however, variation in repeat length at certain loci 
      (FRA16A) may permit identification of susceptible family members. In addition, 
      polymorphisms with prognostic significance were identified. These were high 
      length (but not expanded) repeats at FRA11B (P = 0.01), ATXN1 (P = 0.032) and 
      ATXN3 (P = 0.022), all associated with poor risk disease.

TI  - Cambodian founder effect for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (Machado-Joseph 
      disease).
PG  - 110-3
AB  - Four families from the same region of Cambodia immigrated to the Pacific 
      Northwest of the United States. All four families have been discovered to have 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA 3; Machado-Joseph disease) with a similar 
      clinical phenotype. CAG repeat expansions in the ATXN3 gene range from 72 to 77. 
      Mean age of onset has varied from 19 to 44 years and mean age at death of 4 
      individuals has been 60 years. The prevalence of the various subtypes of SCA 
      varies worldwide from country to country. Neurologists should be alert to the 
      possibility of SCA 3 in Cambodian patients with unexplained cerebellar ataxia.

TI  - A multistep mutation mechanism drives the evolution of the CAG repeat at MJD/SCA3 
      locus.
PG  - 932-40
AB  - Despite the intense debate around the repeat instability reported on the large 
      group of neurological disorders caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions, little 
      is known about the mutation process underlying alleles in the normal range that, 
      ultimately, expand to pathological size. In this study, we assessed the mutation 
      mechanisms by which wild-type Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) alleles have been 
      generated throughout human evolution. Haplotypes including the CAG repeat, six 
      intragenic SNPs and four flanking microsatellites were analysed in 431 normal 
      chromosomes of European, Asian and African origin. A bimodal CAG repeat length 
      frequency distribution was found in the four most frequent wild-type lineages 
      (H1-GCGGCA; H2-GTGGCA; H3-TTAGAC and H4-TTACAC). Based on flanking microsatellite 
      haplotypes, the variance calculated by analysis of molecular variance between 
      modal (CAG)n alleles was little or null in lineages H1, H2 and H4, as were the 
      pairwise differences. Moreover, genetic distances among all the alleles from each 
      lineage did not reflect the allele sizes differences, as expected if a stepwise 
      mutation model was the main process of evolution. On the contrary, when exposed 
      in maximum parsimonious phylogenetic trees, a large number of mutation steps 
      separated same-size alleles, whereas several microsatellite haplotypes were 
      shared by modal CAGs. In conclusion, our results suggest that the main mutation 
      mechanism occurring in the evolution of the polymorphic CAG region at MJD/SCA3 
      locus is a multistep one, either by gene conversion or DNA slippage; repeats with 
      14, 21, 23 and 27 CAGs are the main alleles involved in this process.

TI  - Genetic analysis of SCA2, 3 and 17 in idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 11-4
AB  - Recent reports of SCA2 and SCA3 patients who presented with levodopa responsive 
      parkinsonism have generated considerable interest as they have implications for 
      genetic testing. It is unclear whether ethnic race alone or founder effects 
      within certain geographical region explain such an association. In this study, we 
      conducted genetic analysis of SCA2, 3, 17 in an ethnic Chinese cohort with early 
      onset and familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy controls. A total of 191 
      subjects comprising of 91 PD and 100 healthy controls were examined. We 
      identified one positive case of SCA2 in an early-onset sporadic PD patient who 
      had CAG 36 repeats, yielding a prevalence of 2.2% in early-onset sporadic PD 
      patients and less than 1.0% in our study PD population. The size of the repeats 
      was lower than the expanded repeats (38-57) in SCA2 patients with ataxia in our 
      population. All the children of the patient were physically normal even though 
      some of them carried the repeat expansion of similar size. No cases and controls 
      were positive for SCA3 and SCA17. We do not think routine screening of SCA2, SCA3 
      and SCA17 for all idiopathic PD patients is cost-effective in our ethnic Chinese 
      population. However, SCA2 should be a differential diagnosis in young onset 
      sporadic PD when genetic mutations of other known PD genes have been excluded.

TI  - Towards a structural understanding of the fibrillization pathway in 
      Machado-Joseph's disease: trapping early oligomers of non-expanded ataxin-3.
PG  - 642-54
AB  - Machado-Joseph's disease is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion that 
      is translated into an abnormally long polyglutamine tract in the protein 
      ataxin-3. Except for the polyglutamine region, proteins associated with 
      polyglutamine diseases are unrelated, and for all of these diseases aggregates 
      containing these proteins are the major components of the nuclear proteinaceous 
      deposits found in the brain. Aggregates of the expanded proteins display 
      amyloid-like morphological and biophysical properties. Human ataxin-3 containing 
      a non-pathological number of glutamine residues (14Q), as well as its 
      Caenorhabditis elegans (1Q) orthologue, showed a high tendency towards 
      self-interaction and aggregation, under near-physiological conditions. In order 
      to understand the discrete steps in the assembly process leading to ataxin-3 
      oligomerization, we have separated chromatographically high molecular mass 
      oligomers as well as medium mass multimers of non-expanded ataxin-3. We show 
      that: (a) oligomerization occurs independently of the poly(Q)-repeat and it is 
      accompanied by an increase in beta-structure; and (b) the first intermediate in 
      the oligomerization pathway is a Josephin domain-mediated dimer of ataxin-3. 
      Furthermore, non-expanded ataxin-3 oligomers are recognized by a specific 
      antibody that targets a conformational epitope present in soluble cytotoxic 
      species found in the fibrillization pathway of expanded polyglutamine proteins 
      and other amyloid-forming proteins. Imaging of the oligomeric forms of the 
      non-pathological protein using electron microscopy reveals globular particles, as 
      well as short chains of such particles that likely mimic the initial stages in 
      the fibrillogenesis pathway occurring in the polyglutamine-expanded protein. 
      Thus, they constitute potential targets for therapeutic approaches in 
      Machado-Joseph's disease, as well as valuable diagnostic markers in disease 
      settings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the profile of cytosine/adenine/guanine (CAG) repeat 
      expansion in Omani spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) patients. METHODS: Ten SCA 
      patients attending the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital Neurologic clinics, 
      Al-Khoud, Oman in the 3 years starting from January 2000 were recruited for this 
      study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples and CAG repeat 
      expansion analysis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing, 
      when required. RESULTS: The CAG triplet repeats leading to polyglutamine 
      expansion and neurodegeneration are seen in spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 
      and 17. By using primers for SCA 1, 2, 3 and 7, we found the repeats were in the 
      normal range and triplet repeats do not seem to be a common cause for ataxia in 
      Oman. CONCLUSION: Spinocerebellar ataxia in Oman has the normal range of CAG 
      repeats for the commonly found SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA7.

TI  - Comparative genetics of functional trinucleotide tandem repeats in humans and 
      apes.
PG  - 329-39
AB  - Several human neurodegenerative disorders are caused by the expansion of 
      polymorphic trinucleotide repeat regions. Many of these loci are functional short 
      tandem repeats (STRs) located in brain-expressed genes, and their study is thus 
      relevant from both a medical and an evolutionary point of view. The aims of our 
      study are to infer the comparative pattern of variation and evolution of this set 
      of loci in order to show species-specific features in this group of STRs and on 
      their potential for expansion (therefore, an insight into evolutionary medicine) 
      and to unravel whether any human-specific feature may be identified in 
      brain-expressed genes involved in human disease. We analyzed the variability of 
      the normal range of seven expanding STR CAG/CTG loci (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3-MJD, SCA6, 
      SCA8, SCA12, and DRPLA) and two nonexpanding polymorphic CAG loci (KCNN3 and 
      NCOA3) in humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. The study showed a 
      general conservation of the repetitive tract and of the polymorphism in the four 
      species and high heterogeneity among loci distributions. Humans present slightly 
      larger alleles than the rest of species but a more relevant difference appears in 
      variability levels: Humans are the species with the largest variance, although 
      only for the expanding loci, suggesting a relationship between variability levels 
      and expansion potential. The sequence analysis shows high levels of sequence 
      conservation among species, a lack of correspondence between interruption 
      patterns and variability levels, and signs of conservative selective pressure for 
      some of the STR loci. Only two loci (SCA1 and SCA8) show a human specific 
      distribution, with larger alleles than the rest of species. This could account, 
      at the same time, for a human-specific trait and a predisposition to disease 
      through expansion.

TI  - Full-length expanded ataxin-3 enhances mitochondrial-mediated cell death and 
      decreases Bcl-2 expression in human neuroblastoma cells.
PG  - 1274-82
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      degeneration characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations. An 
      unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in MJD gene on long arm of chromosome 
      14 has been identified as the pathologic mutation of MJD and apoptosis was 
      previously shown to be responsible for the neuronal cell death of the disease. In 
      this study, we utilized human neuronal SK-N-SH cells stably transfected with 
      HA-tagged full-length MJD with 78 polyglutamine repeats to examine the effects of 
      polyglutamine expansion on neuronal cell survival in the early stage of disease. 
      Various pro-apoptotic agents were used to assess the tolerance of the mutant 
      cells and to compare the differences between cells with and without mutant 
      ataxin-3. Concentration- and time-dependent experiments showed that the increase 
      in staurosporine-induced cell death was more pronounced and accelerated in cells 
      containing expanded ataxin-3 via MTS assays. Interestingly, under basal 
      conditions, Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses showed a significant 
      decrease of Bcl-2 protein expression and an increase of cytochrome c in cells 
      containing expanded ataxin-3 when compared with those of the parental cells. The 
      same reduction of Bcl-2 was further confirmed in fibroblast cells with mutant 
      ataxin-3. In addition, exogenous expression of Bcl-2 desensitized SK-N-SH-MJD78 
      cells to poly-Q toxicity. These results indicated that mitochondrial-mediated 
      cell death plays a role in the pathogenesis of MJD. In our cellular model, 
      full-length expanded ataxin-3 that leads to neurodegenerative disorders 
      significantly impaired the expression of Bcl-2 protein, which may be, at least in 
      part, responsible for the weak tolerance to polyglutamine toxicity at the early 
      stage of disease and ultimately resulted in an increase of stress-induced cell 
      death upon apoptotic stress.

TI  - Structural and functional analysis of ataxin-2 and ataxin-3.
PG  - 3155-70
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia types 2 (SCA2) and 3 (SCA3) are autosomal-dominantly 
      inherited, neurodegenerative diseases caused by CAG repeat expansions in the 
      coding regions of the genes encoding ataxin-2 and ataxin-3, respectively. To 
      provide a rationale for further functional experiments, we explored the protein 
      architectures of ataxin-2 and ataxin-3. Using structure-based multiple sequence 
      alignments of homologous proteins, we investigated domains, sequence motifs, and 
      interaction partners. Our analyses focused on presumably functional amino acids 
      and the construction of tertiary structure models of the RNA-binding Lsm domain 
      of ataxin-2 and the deubiquitinating Josephin domain of ataxin-3. We also 
      speculate about distant evolutionary relationships of ubiquitin-binding UIM, GAT, 
      UBA and CUE domains and helical ANTH and UBX domain extensions.

TI  - Detection and isolation of trinucleotide repeat expansions using the RED method.
PG  - 47-59
AB  - To facilitate identification of disease genes containing an expanded 
      trinucleotide repeat, a repeat expansion detection (RED) and gene cloning system 
      was established. The RED method was developed to enable detection of expanded 
      trinucleotide repeat sequences in any DNA sample from any species without prior 
      knowledge of the DNA sequences flanking the repeat. The DNA to be tested is used 
      as a template for a repeat oligonucleotide to anneal and ligate in a two-step 
      cycling procedure. After hundreds of annealing/ligation cycles, a large amount of 
      oligonucleotide multimers is accumulated. The longest multimer represents the 
      largest repeat expansion in the genome tested. The gene isolation strategy is 
      based on size separation of genomic fragments, followed by subcloning and library 
      hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe. The expanded trinucleotide repeat is 
      identified throughout the procedure using the RED method. Using this approach, 
      two disease genes, the Huntington's disease gene and the MJD/SCA3 gene, were 
      cloned. This cloning strategy should be applicable to isolation of any DNA 
      fragment containing large trinucleotide repeat expansions in any species.

      dystrophy type 1 and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.
PG  - 61-3
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansions are the underlying mutation in several 
      neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders including at least eight 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA). The molecular mechanisms of repeat expansion are 
      as yet insufficiently understood. Recently, an association of the SCA1 (CAG)31 
      repeat allele with Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy type 1 was 
      described. These findings implicate a possible role of the SCA1 (CAG)31 allele in 
      other triplet diseases. We analyzed the SCA1 CAG repeat length in a large sample 
      of Huntington's disease (n=182), myotonic dystrophy type 1 (n=64) and SCA3 (n=31) 
      patients. In none of these groups was a significant association with the 31 
      repeat allele found. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that this allele 
      is involved in the etiology of trinucleotide expansion.

TI  - Molecular genetics of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia: mutation analysis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia genes and CAG/CTG repeat expansion detection in 225 
      Italian families.
PG  - 727-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, at present 
      associated with 22 loci (spinocerebellar ataxia [SCA] 1-SCA8, SCA10-SCA19, SCA21, 
      SCA22, fibroblast growth factor 14 [FGF14]-SCA, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy [DRPLA]). The relevant gene has been identified in 12 cases (SCA1-3, 
      SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, FGF14, and DRPLA), and in all but the recently identified 
      SCA14, SCA17, PRKCG and FGF14 genes, the defect consists of the expansion of a 
      short nucleotide repeat. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relative prevalence of 
      SCA1-3, SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, and SCA17 gene expansions in Italian families with 
      hereditary ataxia, specifically to verify the occurrence of SCA10, SCA12, and 
      SCA17 in Italy; and to analyze samples from probands with negative test results 
      at the initial screening by means of the repeat expansion detection technique to 
      identify CAG/CTG expansions in novel loci.Patients Two hundred twenty-five 
      unrelated Italian index cases with hereditary ataxia, most (n = 183) of whom 
      presented with a clear dominantly transmitted trait. RESULTS: We found that SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene mutations accounted for most cases (21% and 24%, respectively). We 
      found SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, and SCA17 to be very rare (approximately 1% each), 
      and no case of SCA10 or SCA12 was identified. Half of the index cases (113/225) 
      were negative for expansions in the known SCA genes. Repeat expansion detection 
      analysis performed on 111 of these cases showed a CAG/CTG repeat expansion of at 
      least 50 triplets in 22 (20%). Twenty-one of 22 expansions could be attributed to 
      length variation at 2 polymorphic loci (expanded repeat domain CAG/CTG 1 [ERDA1] 
      or CTG repeat on chromosome 18q21.1 [CTG18.1]). In 1 patient, the expansion was 
      assigned to the DRPLA gene. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of SCA1-3 and SCA6-7 
      gene mutations is peculiar in Italy. We found a relatively high frequency of SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene expansions; SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 mutations were rare, compared with 
      other European countries. No SCA10 or SCA12 and only a few SCA8 (2/225) and SCA17 
      (2/225) families were detected. In patients negative for defects in known SCA 
      genes, repeat expansion detection data strongly suggest that, at least in our 
      population, CAG/CTG expansions in novel genes should be considered an unlikely 
      cause of the SCA phenotype.

TI  - Caspase-mediated proteolysis of the polyglutamine disease protein ataxin-3.
PG  - 908-18
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3, also known as Machado-Joseph Disease, is one of 
      many inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by polyglutamine-encoding CAG 
      repeat expansions in otherwise unrelated disease genes. Polyglutamine disorders 
      are characterized by disease protein misfolding and aggregation; often within the 
      nuclei of affected neurons. Although the precise mechanism of 
      polyglutamine-mediated cell death remains elusive, evidence suggests that 
      proteolysis of polyglutamine disease proteins by caspases contributes to 
      pathogenesis. Using cellular models we now show that the endogenous 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 disease protein, ataxin-3, is proteolyzed in 
      apoptotic paradigms, resulting in the loss of full-length ataxin-3 and the 
      corresponding appearance of an approximately 28-kDa fragment containing the 
      glutamine repeat. Broad-spectrum caspase inhibitors block ataxin-3 proteolysis 
      and studies suggest that caspase-1 is a primary mediator of cleavage. 
      Site-directed mutagenesis experiments eliminating three, six or nine potential 
      caspase cleavage sites in the protein suggest redundancy in the site(s) at which 
      cleavage can occur, as previously described for other disease proteins; but also 
      map a major cleavage event to a cluster of aspartate residues within the 
      ubiquitin-binding domain of ataxin-3 near the polyglutamine tract. Finally, 
      caspase-mediated cleavage of expanded ataxin-3 resulted in increased ataxin-3 
      aggregation, suggesting a potential role for caspase-mediated proteolysis in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 pathogenesis.

TI  - Analysis of trinucleotide repeats in different SCA loci in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      patients and in normal population of Taiwan.
PG  - 355-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) patients referred to our research 
      center, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD (Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, SCA8 and SCA12 
      loci were assessed for expansion of trinucleotide repeats. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      A total of 211 ADCA patients, including 202 patients with dominantly inherited 
      ataxia from 81 Taiwanese families and nine patients with sporadic ataxia, were 
      included in this study and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. 
      The amplified products of all loci were analyzed on both 3% agarose gels and 6% 
      denaturing urea-polyacrylamide gels. PCR-based Southern blots were also applied 
      for the detection of SCA7 locus. RESULTS: The SCA1 mutation was detected in six 
      affected individuals from one family (1.2%) with expanded alleles of 50-53 CAG 
      repeats. Fourteen individuals from nine families (11%) had a CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while affected SCA2 alleles have 34-49 CAG 
      repeats. The SCA3/MJD CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in 60 affected 
      individuals from 26 families (32%) was expanded to 71-85 CAG repeats. As for the 
      SCA7 locus, there were two affected individuals from one family (1.2%) possessed 
      41 and 100 CAG repeats, respectively. However, we did not detect expansion in the 
      SCA6, SCA8 and SCA12 loci in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The SCA3/MJD CAG expansion 
      was the most frequent mutation among the SCA patients. The relative prevalence of 
      SCA3/MJD in Taiwan was higher than that of SCA2, SCA1 and SCA7.

TI  - Haplotype study in Dutch SCA3 and SCA6 families: evidence for common founder 
      mutations.
PG  - 441-6
AB  - This pilot study was initiated to show the existence of founder effects in the 
      Dutch autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) population. The ADCAs comprise 
      a clinically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders and the estimated 
      prevalence in the Netherlands is approximately 3:100 000 individuals. Here, we 
      focused on the SCA3 and SCA6 genes because mutations in these genes occur most 
      frequently in the Netherlands. We were able to determine a common origin of the 
      CAG repeat expansions in the majority of Dutch SCA3 and SCA6 families. Haplotype 
      analysis and linkage disequilibrium studies with polymorphic markers revealed 
      shared haplotypes surrounding the SCA3 and SCA6 genes. These results strongly 
      suggest that ADCA families can be traced back to common ancestors in particular 
      parts of the Netherlands.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia: SCA2 is the most frequent mutation in 
      eastern India.
PG  - 448-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) has been reported as the 
      commonest dominant hereditary ataxia in India. However, India is an ethnically 
      and religiously diverse population. Previous studies have not clearly indicated 
      exact ethnic and religious origins, and must therefore be interpreted with 
      caution. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of different 
      SCA mutations in a relatively homogeneous population from eastern India. METHODS: 
      We identified 28 families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia from eastern 
      India. Each underwent full clinical evaluation and were analysed for the presence 
      of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, and SCA17 mutations. In addition, 
      haplotype analysis was carried out in seven of the 16 families with SCA2. 
      RESULTS: Seven patients from four (14%) families were positive for an expansion 
      in SCA1 and 26 patients from 16 (57%) families were positive for an expansion in 
      SCA2. No mutations were detected in the remaining eight families (29%). Most of 
      the SCA1 and SCA2 families were Hindu from the state of Bihar. Five out of 26 
      SCA2 patients in this study did not have slow saccades. In addition, four of 
      seven SCA1 patients had slow saccades. We found an association between the SCA2 
      CAG repeat expansion and the 285 base pair (bp) allele of microsatellite marker 
      D12S1672, and also data supportive of the association between the expansion and 
      the 225 bp allele of D12S1333, which has been previously described. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We conclude that (1) although slow ocular saccades are highly suggestive of SCA2, 
      that they are not universal, nor are they exclusive to this disorder and (2) SCA2 
      is likely to be the commonest dominant ataxia in eastern India, with further 
      evidence for a founder effect.

TI  - Prenatal diagnosis of Machado-Joseph disease/Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 in 
      Taiwan: early detection of expanded ataxin-3.
PG  - 195-200
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3) is a rare 
      autosomal dominative disorder in which one of the neurodegenerative disorders is 
      caused by a translated CAG repeat expansion. Here, we present the first prenatal 
      diagnosis of MJD in Taiwan in a woman whose husband was known to carry an 
      unstable CAG repeat expansion in the MJD gene. After evaluating the couples' 
      motivation and psychological tolerance, amniocentesis was performed at gestation 
      of 13 weeks. The diagnosis was made using a simple nonradioactive polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) for rapid detection of the presence of an expanded MJD 
      allele. Meanwhile, using radioactive PCR, we identified the presence of an 
      unusual shortness of CAG expansion in the MJD gene with 74 repeats in the fetus 
      compared with 78 repeats in the father. After termination of the pregnancy, 
      Western blot analysis further confirmed the presence of normal and mutant 
      ataxin-3 in the fetal tissue. In summary, we have performed the first prenatal 
      diagnosis of MJD in Taiwan, and described our experience with an at-risk male 
      requesting counseling, carrier testing, and prenatal diagnosis for Machado-Joseph 
      disease. Early detection of both normal and expanded ataxin-3 in fetal tissues 
      was first demonstrated in the present study.

TI  - Mutation at the SCA17 locus is not a common cause of parkinsonism.
PG  - 317-20
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 17 is a dominant, progressive, neurodegenerative 
      disorder. The disease is caused by a triplet repeat expansion mutation within 
      TATA-binding protein (TBP). Ataxia, dementia, parkinsonism and dystonia are 
      common features. We have previously shown in several pedigrees that SCA-2 and 
      SCA-3 can cause both parkinsonism and typical Parkinson's disease in the absence 
      of prominent ataxia; a finding which has been confirmed by others. Given these 
      previous findings and the description of parkinsonism as a common feature of 
      SCA-17 we examined this locus in a series of probands from families with 2 or 
      more members affected with parkinsonism (n=51) and a group of sporadic 
      parkinsonism patients (n=59). We did not find any repeat sizes in the pathogenic 
      range. The repeats we observed ranged from 29 to 41 (mean 36.8; median 37). We 
      conclude that SCA-17 repeat expansion mutations are not a common cause of 
      familial parkinsonism.

TI  - Down-regulation of heat shock protein 27 in neuronal cells and non-neuronal cells 
      expressing mutant ataxin-3.
PG  - 307-14
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is an autosomal 
      dominant spinocerebellar degeneration characterized by a wide range of clinical 
      manifestations. Unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the MJD gene has 
      been identified as the pathologic mutation of MJD. In this study, human SK-N-SH 
      neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with full-length MJD with 78 CAG repeats 
      were established. Compared with the parental cells, cells expressing mutant 
      ataxin-3 displayed normal morphology for over 80 generations. Less than 1% of the 
      transfected cells contained nuclear aggregates under basal conditions, indicating 
      that this cellular model represented an early disease stage. While t-butyl 
      hydroperoxide (TBH) was used to assess the oxidative tolerance of cells, the 
      results demonstrated that the transfected cells were more susceptible to low 
      concentrations of TBH than the parental cells. Most interestingly, from 2D gel 
      electrophoresis analysis, we identified that the expression of heat shock protein 
      27 (HSP27), known as a suppressor of poly(Q)-mediated cell death, dramatically 
      decreased in SK-N-SH cells stably transfected with full-length mutant MJD. The 
      same reduction of HSP27 was further confirmed in lymphoblastoid cells from MJD 
      patients. Our results demonstrated that both neuronal and non-neuronal cells with 
      expanded full-length ataxin-3 revealed reduced protein expression of HSP27. We 
      propose that the reduction of HSP27 in the early stage of the disease plays an 
      important role during cell death process in MJD.

TI  - Frequency analysis and clinical characterization of spinocerebellar ataxia types 
      1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 in Korean patients.
PG  - 858-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: By genetic analysis, the CAG repeat expansion has been established in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. Despite the genetic 
      differentiation of SCA, the characterization of the phenotypes of various SCAs 
      has been challenging for better clinical diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the 
      frequencies and the clinical manifestations of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 
      in Korean patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed genetic analysis in 253 
      unrelated Korean patients with progressive cerebellar ataxia. We compared the 
      frequencies, inheritance patterns, and various clinical manifestations of 
      patients with genetically confirmed SCA. RESULTS: Among the 52 patients with 
      expanded CAG repeat, the most frequent SCA type was SCA2, followed by SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA1, and SCA7. Nine patients (17%) had a negative family history of ataxia, 
      mostly in SCA6. There were characteristic clinical features such as hypotonia and 
      optic atrophy for SCA1; hyporeflexia for SCA2; nystagmus, bulging eye, and 
      dystonia for SCA3; and macular degeneration for SCA7. Interestingly, 4 patients 
      (1 with SCA2, 1 with SCA3, and 2 with SCA6) were misdiagnosed as having 
      multiple-system atrophy because of the absence of family history and the presence 
      of parkinsonism and urinary incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a 
      detailed analysis of the clinical characteristics of the genetically defined 
      CAG-repeat SCAs in Korean patients. Although phenotypes were heterogeneous, some 
      clinical features may be helpful for clinical diagnosis. However, genetic studies 
      for SCA are needed despite uncertain family history or the presence of atypical 
      clinical features causing misdiagnosis as atypical parkinsonism.

TI  - Structural modeling of ataxin-3 reveals distant homology to adaptins.
PG  - 355-70
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a polyglutamine disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the coding region of a gene encoding ataxin-3, a protein of 
      yet unknown function. Based on a comprehensive computational analysis, we propose 
      a structural model and structure-based functions for ataxin-3. Our predictive 
      strategy comprises the compilation of multiple sequence and structure alignments 
      of carefully selected proteins related to ataxin-3. These alignments are 
      consistent with additional information on sequence motifs, secondary structure, 
      and domain architectures. The application of complementary methods revealed the 
      homology of ataxin-3 to ENTH and VHS domain proteins involved in membrane 
      trafficking and regulatory adaptor functions. We modeled the structure of 
      ataxin-3 using the adaptin AP180 as a template and assessed the reliability of 
      the model by comparison with known sequence and structural features. We could 
      further infer potential functions of ataxin-3 in agreement with known 
      experimental data. Our database searches also identified an as yet 
      uncharacterized family of proteins, which we named josephins because of their 
      pronounced homology to the Josephin domain of ataxin-3.

TI  - A simple method for the detection of neurologic disorders associated with CAG 
      repeat expansion using PCR-microtiter plate hybridization.
PG  - 215-23
AB  - A new screening method was developed for the detection of CAG expanded alleles in 
      patients with hereditary ataxia using polymerase chain reaction-based microtiter 
      plate hybridization (PCR-MPH). The system can be applied to detect pathologic 
      alleles by hybridization with the immobilized (CAG)48 repeat probe derived from 
      the unrelated gene 'ERDA1' except for the CAG repeats. We examined 10 individuals 
      with SCA3, 10 with Huntington disease and 30 normal controls (31 controls for 
      SCA3) using this method. The results showed that a clear discrimination was 
      possible in all cases. We suggest that this system be made available for mass 
      screening of patients with hereditary ataxia disorders. This report is the first 
      to demonstrate that a PCR-MPH system can be successfully applied to DNA size 
      differentiation in addition to base pair mismatches. Also, our design of the 
      probe is unique in that the probe motif stem from the unrelated gene sequence and 
      not from the synthetic oligonucleotides.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias in the Netherlands: prevalence and age at onset variance 
      analysis.
PG  - 702-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: International prevalence estimates of autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxias (ADCA) vary from 0.3 to 2.0 per 100,000. The prevalence of ADCA in the 
      Netherlands is unknown. Fifteen genetic loci have been identified (SCA-1-8, 
      SCA-10-14, SCA-16, and SCA-17) and nine of the corresponding genes have been 
      cloned. In SCA-1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA-12 and SCA-17 the mutation has been 
      shown to be an expanded CAG repeat. Previously, the length of the CAG repeat was 
      found to account for 50 to 80% of variance in age at onset. Because of 
      heterogeneity in encoded proteins, different pathophysiologic mechanisms leading 
      to neurodegeneration could be involved. The relationship between CAG repeat 
      length and age at onset would then differ accordingly. METHOD: Based on the 
      results of SCA mutation analysis in the three DNA diagnostic laboratories that 
      serve the entire Dutch population, the authors surveyed the number of families 
      and affected individuals per SCA gene, as well as individual repeat length and 
      age at onset. Regression analysis was applied to study the relationship between 
      CAG repeat length and age at onset per SCA gene. The slopes of the different 
      regression curves were compared. RESULTS: On November 1, 2000, mutations were 
      found in 145 ADCA families and 391 affected individuals were identified. The 
      authors extrapolated a minimal prevalence of 3.0 per 100,000 (range 2.8 to 
      3.8/100,000). SCA3 was the most frequent mutation. CAG repeat length contributed 
      to 52 to 76% of age at onset variance. Regression curve slopes for SCA-1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, and SCA7 did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated minimal 
      prevalence of ADCA in the Netherlands is 3.0 per 100,000 inhabitants. Except for 
      SCA6, the relationship between age at onset and CAG repeat expansion does not 
      differ significantly between SCA-1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA7 patient groups in our 
      population, indicating that these SCA subtypes share similar mechanisms of 
      polyglutamine-induced neurotoxicity, despite heterogeneity in gene products.

TI  - Spastic paraplegia, ataxia, mental retardation (SPAR): a novel genetic disorder.
PG  - 411-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a kindred with a dominantly inherited neurologic disorder 
      manifested either as uncomplicated spastic paraplegia or ataxia, spastic 
      paraplegia, and mental retardation. METHODS: Neurologic examinations and 
      molecular genetic analysis (exclusion of known SCA and HSP genes and loci; and 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion detection [RED]) were performed in six affected 
      and four unaffected subjects in this family. MRI, electromyography (EMG), and 
      nerve conduction studies were performed in three affected subjects. RESULTS: The 
      phenotype of this dominantly inherited syndrome varied in succeeding generations. 
      Pure spastic paraplegia was present in the earliest generation; subsequent 
      generations had ataxia and mental retardation. MRI showed marked atrophy of the 
      spinal cord in all patients and cerebellar atrophy in those with ataxia. 
      Laboratory analysis showed that the disorder was not caused by mutations in genes 
      that cause SCA-1, SCA-2, SCA-3, SCA-6, SCA-7, SCA-8, and SCA-12; not linked to 
      other known loci for autosomal dominant ataxia (SCA-4, SCA-5, SCA-10, SCA-11, 
      SCA-13, SCA-14, and SCA-16); and not linked to known loci for autosomal dominant 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (SPG-3, SPG-4, SPG-6, SPG-8, SPG-9, SPG-10, 
      SPG-12, and SPG-13) or autosomal recessive HSP SPG-7. Analysis of 
      intergenerational differences in age at onset of symptoms suggests genetic 
      anticipation. Using RED, the authors did not detect expanded CAG, CCT, TGG, or 
      CGT repeats that segregate with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The authors describe an 
      unusual, dominantly inherited neurologic disorder in which the phenotype (pure 
      spastic paraplegia or spastic ataxia with variable mental retardation) differed 
      in subsequent generations. The molecular explanation for apparent genetic 
      anticipation does not appear to involve trinucleotide repeat expansion.

TI  - Is the 31 CAG repeat allele of the spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) gene locus 
      non-specifically associated with trinucleotide expansion diseases?
PG  - 201-5
AB  - A number of human hereditary neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders are 
      caused by the expansion of trinucleotide repeats within certain genes. The 
      molecular mechanisms that underlie these expansions are not yet known. We have 
      analyzed six trinucleotide repeat-containing loci [spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, 
      SCA3, SCA8), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), Huntington chorea (HD) 
      and fragile X syndrome (FRAXA)] in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients (n = 
      52). As controls, we analyzed two groups of subjects: healthy control subjects (n 
      =133), and a group of patients with non-triplet neuromuscular diseases (n = 68) 
      caused by point mutations, deletions or duplications (spinal muscular atrophy, 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 1A, hereditary neuropathy with liability to 
      pressure palsies, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy). Allele frequency 
      distributions for all tested loci were similar in these three groups with the 
      exception of the SCA1 locus. In DM1 patients, the SCA1 allele with 31 CAG repeats 
      account for 40.4% of all chromosomes tested, which is significantly higher than 
      in two other groups (11.3% in healthy controls and 6.6% in the group of 
      non-triplet diseased patients; P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). This is 
      consistent with our previous findings in HD patients. The absence of this 
      association in non-triplet diseases as well as in healthy controls could indicate 
      a possible role of this SCA1 allele with 31 repeats in triplet diseases. Here we 
      discuss a possible role of the SCA1 region in pathological trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions.

TI  - Molecular analysis of Spinocerebellar ataxias in Koreans: frequencies and 
      reference ranges of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7.
PG  - 336-41
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. CAG repeat expansions in the causative genes have been identified as 
      the basic cause of several types of SCAs, and have been used for the diagnoses 
      and classifications of patients with ataxia. In order to assess the frequency and 
      CAG repeat size ranges of SCAs, and to establish an effective strategy for 
      molecular diagnosis, we performed a molecular analysis of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      and SCA7 in 76 patients. These patients were as follows: 32 with dominant 
      inheritance, 39 sporadic cases, and 5 with unknown family histories. The normal 
      and affected CAG repeat size ranges were established at five SCA loci in Koreans, 
      which was consistent with previous reports. The total prevalence of the five 
      types of SCAs was 39.5% in the 76 patients with ataxia, regardless of their 
      family history. It was 75.0% in the 32 families with a dominant inheritance. The 
      most frequent type was SCA3 (15.8%), followed by SCA2 (14.5%). Both types 
      combined formed 76.7% of the 30 patients with CAG expansions. SCA1, SCA6, and 
      SCA7 were less frequent, affecting 3.9%, 2.6%, and 2.6% of the cases, 
      respectively. This mutation spectrum is quite different from a previous report 
      concerning Koreans, but is similar to the distributions that are seen in several 
      ethnic populations worldwide. For a correct and effective diagnosis of SCAs, we 
      suggest that a molecular diagnosis be undertaken, even in patients without a 
      family history, as well as those with a family history. A stepwise approach is 
      also recommended. Patients with ataxia should be tested for SCA2 and SCA3. 
      Individuals testing negative should be tested for SCA1, SCA6, and SCA7.

TI  - A cloning strategy for identification of genes containing trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions.
PG  - 427-31
AB  - Until today, nineteen trinucleotide repeat expansions larger than forty repeat 
      copies have been found in the human genome. Of these, the CAG/CTG repeat is 
      predominant motif with twelve loci identified, ten of which have been associated 
      with the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We have developed a cloning 
      approach which isolates disease genes containing trinucleotide repeat expansions. 
      The method is based on size separation of genomic fragments, followed by 
      subcloning and library hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe. Fractions and 
      clones containing expanded repeats are identified by the repeat expansion 
      detection (RED) method throughout the cloning procedure. Large family materials 
      are not required and as little as 10 microg genomic DNA from a single individual 
      is sufficient for this method. Using this strategy we have cloned two DNA 
      fragments containing expanded repeats from two unrelated patients with a clinical 
      diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia. Sequencing of the two fragments showed sequence 
      identities with two disease genes, the Huntington gene and the ataxin 3 gene, 
      respectively. The method should be adaptable to the cloning of any long repeat 
      motif in any species. Furthermore the experimental steps can be performed in less 
      than a month, making it very effective and time efficient to disease gene 
      identification.

TI  - Inflammatory genes are upregulated in expanded ataxin-3-expressing cell lines and 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 brains.
PG  - 5389-96
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a polyglutamine disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the coding region of a gene encoding ataxin-3. To study 
      putative alterations of gene expression induced by expanded ataxin-3, we 
      performed PCR-based cDNA subtractive hybridization in a cell culture model of 
      SCA3. In rat mesencephalic CSM14.1 cells stably expressing expanded ataxin-3, we 
      found a significant upregulation of mRNAs encoding the endopeptidase matrix 
      metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), the transmembrane protein amyloid precursor protein, 
      the interleukin-1 receptor-related Fos-inducible transcript, and the cytokine 
      stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF1alpha). Immunohistochemical studies of 
      the corresponding or associated proteins in human SCA3 brain tissue confirmed 
      these findings, showing increased expression of MMP-2 and amyloid beta-protein 
      (Abeta) in pontine neurons containing nuclear inclusions. In addition, 
      extracellular Abeta-immunoreactive deposits were detected in human SCA3 pons. 
      Furthermore, pontine neurons of SCA3 brains strongly expressed the 
      antiinflammatory interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, the proinflammatory cytokine 
      interleukin-1beta, and the proinflammatory chemokine SDF1. Finally, increased 
      numbers of reactive astrocytes and activated microglial cells were found in SCA3 
      pons. These results suggest that inflammatory processes are involved in the 
      pathogenesis of SCA3.

TI  - Neurologic findings in Machado-Joseph disease: relation with disease duration, 
      subtypes, and (CAG)n.
PG  - 899-904
AB  - CONTEXT: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      degeneration caused by an expanded CAG repeat on chromosome 14q32.1, is a 
      heterogeneous disorder for clinical manifestations. The reasons for the wide 
      range of neurologic findings in this disease are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To 
      explain part of this heterogeneity through the association of the neurologic 
      findings with sex, disease duration, age of onset, clinical type, and size of CAG 
      repeat expansion. DESIGN: A case-control study. SETTING: Ambulatory care. 
      PATIENTS: A consecutive sample of 62 patients with MJD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: 
      Neurologic signs. RESULTS: A direct relationship was found between the disease 
      duration and severity of gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia, 
      fasciculations, pyramidal syndrome, and ophthalmoplegia (P<.02). The most severe 
      forms of nuclear ophthalmoplegia were associated with type 1 MJD, whereas those 
      of supranuclear ophthalmoplegia were associated with type 3 MJD (P<.001). It was 
      also found that higher mean (CAG)(n) lengths were associated with worse degrees 
      of the pyramidal syndrome and dystonia (P<.001). The presence and severity of 
      nystagmus, eyelid retraction, rigidity and/or bradykinesia, and optic atrophy 
      were not clearly associated with any of the predictive variables under study. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Disease duration can explain part of the heterogeneity of ataxia, 
      dysarthria, dysphagia, fasciculations, pyramidal syndrome, and ophthalmoplegia, 
      in MJD. Type 1 MJD was positively associated with nuclear ophthalmoplegia; type 3 
      MJD was positively associated with supranuclear ophthalmoplegia. Higher mean CAG 
      lengths were found to correlate with the pyramidal syndrome and dystonia. 
      Nystagmus, eyelid retraction, rigidity and/or bradykinesia, and optic atrophy 
      were hardly attributable to any known reason or variable.

TI  - Clinical features and genetic analysis of a new form of spinocerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 234-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically 
      heterogeneous group of disorders. The mutations for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, and SCA-12 are identified and caused by an expansion of a CAG or a CTG 
      repeat sequence of these genes. Six additional loci for SCA4, SCA5, SCA-10, 
      SCA-11, SCA-13, and SCA-14 are mapped. The growing heterogeneity of the autosomal 
      dominant forms of these diseases shows that the genetic etiologies of at least 
      20% of ADCA have yet to be elucidated. METHODS: The authors ascertained and 
      clinically characterized a four-generation pedigree segregating an autosomal 
      dominant phenotype for SCA. Direct mutation analysis, repeat expansion detection 
      analysis, and linkage analysis for all known SCA loci were performed. RESULTS: 
      Direct mutational analysis excluded SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 12; genetic linkage 
      analysis excluded SCA4, 5,10, 11, 13, and 14, giving significant negative lod 
      scores. Examination of the family showed that all affected members had gait 
      ataxia and akinesia with variable features of dysarthria, hyporeflexia, and mild 
      intellectual impairment. Eye movements were normal. Head MRI showed atrophy of 
      the cerebellum without involvement of the brainstem. In 10 parent-child pairs, 
      median onset occurred 10.5 years earlier in offspring than in their parents, 
      suggesting anticipation. CONCLUSION: This family is distinct from other families 
      with SCA and is characterized by cerebellar ataxia and extrapyramidal signs.

TI  - Genetic background of apparently idiopathic sporadic cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 132-7
AB  - Disease-causing mutations have been identified in various entities of autosomal 
      dominant ataxia and in Friedreich's ataxia. However, no molecular pathogenic 
      factor is known to cause idiopathic cerebellar ataxias. We investigated the 
      CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats causing spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 
      8 and 12, and the GAA repeat of the frataxin gene in 124 patients apparently 
      suffering from idiopathic sporadic ataxia, including 20 patients with the 
      clinical diagnosis of multiple system atrophy. Patients with a positive family 
      history, a typical Friedreich phenotype, or symptomatic ataxia were excluded. 
      Genetic analyses uncovered the most common Friedreich mutation in 10 patients 
      with an age at onset between 13 and 36 years. The SCA6 mutation was present in 
      nine patients with disease onset between 47 and 68 years of age. The CTG repeat 
      associated with SCA8 was expanded in three patients. One patient had SCA2 
      attributable to a de novo mutation from a paternally transmitted, intermediate 
      allele. We did not identify the SCA1, SCA3, SCA7 or SCA12 mutation in idiopathic 
      sporadic ataxia patients. No trinucleotide repeat expansion was detected in the 
      MSA subgroup. This study has revealed the genetic basis in 19% of apparently 
      idiopathic ataxia patients. SCA6 is the most frequent mutation in late onset 
      cerebellar ataxia. The frataxin trinucleotide expansion should be investigated in 
      all sporadic ataxia patients with onset before age 40, even when the phenotype is 
      atypical for Friedreich's ataxia.

TI  - CREB-binding protein sequestration by expanded polyglutamine.
PG  - 2197-202
AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is one of eight inherited 
      neurodegenerative diseases known to be caused by CAG repeat expansion. The 
      expansion results in an expanded polyglutamine tract, which likely confers a 
      novel, toxic function to the affected protein. Cell culture and transgenic mouse 
      studies have implicated the nucleus as a site for pathogenesis, suggesting that a 
      critical nuclear factor or process is disrupted by the polyglutamine expansion. 
      In this report we present evidence that CREB-binding protein (CBP), a 
      transcriptional co-activator that orchestrates nuclear response to a variety of 
      cell signaling cascades, is incorporated into nuclear inclusions formed by 
      polyglutamine-containing proteins in cultured cells, transgenic mice and tissue 
      from patients with SBMA. We also show CBP incorporation into nuclear inclusions 
      formed in a cell culture model of another polyglutamine disease, spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 3. We present evidence that soluble levels of CBP are reduced in 
      cells expressing expanded polyglutamine despite increased levels of CBP mRNA. 
      Finally, we demonstrate that over-expression of CBP rescues cells from 
      polyglutamine-mediated toxicity in neuronal cell culture. These data support a 
      CBP-sequestration model of polyglutamine expansion disease.

TI  - Analysis of CAG repeats in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia patients and distribution of CAG repeats at the SCA1, SCA2 
      and SCA6 loci in nine ethnic populations of eastern India.
PG  - 597-604
AB  - To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 57 unrelated 
      individuals clinically diagnosed as ataxia patients we analysed the SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci for expansion of CAG repeats. We detected CAG 
      repeat expansion in 6 patients (10.5%) at the SCA1 locus. Ten of the 57 patients 
      (17.5%) had CAG repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while four had CAG expansion 
      at the SCA3/MJD locus (7%). At the SCA6 locus there was a single patient (1.8%) 
      with 21 CAG repeats. We have not detected any patient with expansion in the SCA7 
      and DRPLA loci. To test whether the frequencies of the large normal alleles in 
      SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6 loci can reflect some light on prevalence of the subtypes of 
      SCAs we studied the CAG repeat variation in these loci in nine ethnic 
      sub-populations of eastern India from which the patients originated. We report 
      here that the frequency of large normal alleles (>31 CAG repeats) in SCA1 locus 
      to be 0.211 of 394 chromosomes studied. We also report that the frequency of 
      large normal alleles (>22 CAG repeats) at the SCA2 locus is 0.038 while at the 
      SCA6 locus frequency of large normal alleles (>13 repeats) is 0.032. We discussed 
      our data in light of the distribution of normal alleles and prevalence of SCAs in 
      the Japanese and white populations.

TI  - Prevalence of triplet repeat expansion in ataxia patients from Hokkaido, the 
      northernmost island of Japan.
PG  - 45-51
AB  - Approximately 44% of cases of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) in Hokkaido, the 
      northernmost island of Japan, were estimated to be inherited. To determine the 
      prevalence of triplet repeat expansion in hereditary SCA patients, we genotyped 
      seven genetically defined dominant SCAs in 349 patients, including 266 patients 
      from 77 families, 78 probands from unrelated families with hereditary late-onset 
      SCA, and five patients in whom a family history of SCA was not demonstrated. The 
      frequency of each disorder in a total of 155 unrelated families was 23.9% for 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), 29.0% for SCA6, 9.7% for SCA1, 7.7% for SCA2, and 
      2.6% for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. Abnormal expansion of triplet 
      repeats for SCA7 and SCA8 was not detected. A total of 27.1% of the patients had 
      still unknown SCA mutations. In addition, the GAA repeat in the frataxin gene was 
      not abnormally expanded in 13 early-onset SCA patients with clinical features 
      similar to those of Friedreich ataxia. Comparison of our results with those from 
      other centers handling SCA showed that MJD is prevalent throughout Japan, but the 
      frequencies of other dominant SCAs differ considerably even within Japan.

TI  - Frequency of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, and DRPLA CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in patients with hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia from Chinese 
      kindreds.
PG  - 540-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of SCA1 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 1), SCA2, 
      SCA3/MJD (spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, and 
      DRPLA (dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy) CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions 
      [(CAG)n] among persons diagnosed with hereditary SCA from Chinese families. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, 
      and DRPLA (CAG)n mutation were detected with the polymerase chain reaction, 
      highly denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and silver staining 
      technique in 167 patients with autosomal dominant SCA from 85 Chinese families 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA. RESULTS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (CAG)n 
      mutation in 7 patients from 4 kindreds (4.70%) was expanded to 53 to 62 repeats. 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (CAG)n mutation in 12 patients from 5 kindreds 
      (5.88%) was expanded to 42 to 47 repeats. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3/Machado-Joseph disease (CAG)n mutation in 83 patients from 41 kindreds (48.23%) 
      was expanded to 68 to 83 repeats. Sixty-five patients from 35 kindreds (41.19%) 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA did not test positive for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, 
      SCA6, SCA7, or DRPLA. There was a predictable inverse relationship between the 
      number of CAG repeats and the age at onset for SCA3/MJD and SCA2. Clinically, 
      dementia and hyporeflexia were more frequent in patients with SCA2, while 
      spasticity, hyperreflexia, and Babinski signs were more frequent in patients with 
      SCA3/ MJD, and those might be helpful in clinical work to primarily distinguish 
      patients with SCA3/MJD and SCA2 from others with different types of SCA. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of SCA3/MJD is substantially higher than that of SCA1 
      and SCA2 in patients with autosomal dominant SCA from Chinese kindreds, who are 
      non-Portuguese. Clinical expressions of the various types of SCAs overlap one 
      another; therefore, for clinical study it is important to make a gene diagnosis 
      and genetic classification for patients with SCA.

TI  - Absence of unidentified CAG repeat expansion in patients with Huntington's 
      disease-like phenotype.
PG  - 672-5
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by an expanded (CAG)n repeat on the huntingtin gene. It is characterised 
      by motor, psychiatric and cognitive disturbances. Diagnosis can be confirmed by 
      direct genetic testing, which is highly sensitive and specific and is now 
      considered definitive. This study focused on 21 patients presenting with a 
      clinical phenotype showing strong similarity to HD, but who do not have an 
      expanded CAG in the huntingtin gene. However, other possible diagnoses could be 
      evoked for most of them. Seven patients (3.5% of our cohort) could be considered 
      as phenocopies of HD with no alternative diagnosis. Samples were screened for 
      other triplet repeat diseases with similar presentation (DRPLA, SCA-1, SCA-2, 
      SCA-3, SCA-6, and SCA-7) and were all negative. The repeat expansion detection 
      technique (RED) was used to detect uncloned CAG repeat expansions and samples 
      were also analysed by polymerase chain reaction for expansions of the polymorphic 
      CAG-ERDA-1 and CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeats. RED expansion (>40 repeats) was 
      detected in only one patient. The results suggest that unstable CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions corresponding to known or unknown sequences are not involved in the 
      aetiology of HD-like disorders. It is hypothesised that some of these phenocopies 
      could correspond to mutations in other unidentified genes with other unstable 
      repeats (different from CAG) or in unknown genes with other mutations.

TI  - Characterization of the rat spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 gene.
PG  - 103-12
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) belongs to a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive cerebellar 
      ataxia. The disease-causing mutation has recently been identified as an unstable 
      and expanded (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat in a novel gene of unknown function. In 
      Caucasians, repeat expansions in the MJD1 gene have also been found in patients 
      with the clinically distinct autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 
      (SCA3). In order to gain insight into the biology of the MJD1/SCA3 gene we cloned 
      the rat homologue and studied its expression. The rat and human ataxin-3 genes 
      are highly homologous with an overall sequence identity of approximately 88%. 
      However, the C-terminal end of the putative protein differs strongly from the 
      published human sequence. The (CAG)n block in the rat cDNA consists of just three 
      interrupted units suggesting that a long polyglutamine stretch is not essential 
      for the normal function of the ataxin-3 protein in rodents. The expression 
      pattern of the SCA3 gene in various rat and human tissues was investigated by 
      Northern blot analyses. The mature transcript is approximately 6 kb in length. In 
      rat testis, a smaller transcript of 1.3 kb was identified. Transcription of rsca3 
      was detected in most rat tissues including brain. Analyzing the expression level 
      of the SCA3 gene in several human brain sections revealed no significant higher 
      mRNA level in regions predominantly affected in MJD. Thus additional molecules 
      and/or regulatory events are necessary to explain the exclusive degeneration of 
      certain brain areas.

AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is caused by 
      unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the coding region of the MJD gene. 
      In this study, we describe a non-radioactive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      method to detect the CAG repeat range of the MJD gene. This technique allows 
      direct visualization of the PCR products on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels 
      within hours. In this study, genomic DNA samples isolated from peripheral 
      lymphocytes, amniotic fluid cells, and chorionic villi were tested with two sets 
      of commonly used MJD primers. PCR conditions were optimized, which resulted in 
      clear visualization of both the primer sets on 3% agarose gels. Ten out of 25 
      candidate MJD patients have been identified with this method to date, with no 
      false-positive or false-negative diagnoses. This simple, reliable, and 
      cost-effective method can be used for patient diagnosis, pre-symptomatic 
      diagnosis, and prenatal diagnosis.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias in Spanish patients: genetic analysis of familial and 
      sporadic cases. The Ataxia Study Group.
PG  - 516-22
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically heterogeneous group 
      of neurodegenerative disorders caused by unstable CAG repeat expansions encoding 
      polyglutamine tracts. Five spinocerebellar ataxia genes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 
      and SCA7) and another related dominant ataxia gene (DRPLA) have been cloned, 
      allowing the genetic classification of these disorders. We present here the 
      molecular analysis of 87 unrelated familial and 60 sporadic Spanish cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia. For ADCA cases 15% were SCA2, 15% SCA3, 6% SCA1, 3% SCA7, 
      1% SCA6 and 1% DRPLA, an extremely rare mutation in Caucasoid populations. About 
      58% of ADCA cases remained genetically unclassified. All the SCA1 cases belong to 
      the same geographical area and share a common haplotype for the SCA1 mutation. 
      The expanded alleles ranged from 41 to 59 repeats for SCA1, 35 to 46 [corrected] 
      for SCA2, 67 to 77 for SCA3, and 38 to 113 for SCA7. One SCA6 case had 25 repeats 
      and one DRPLA case had 63 repeats. The highest CAG repeat variation in meiotic 
      transmission of expanded alleles was detected in SCA7, this being of +67 units in 
      one paternal transmission and giving rise to a 113 CAG repeat allele in a patient 
      who died at 3 years of age. Meiotic transmissions have also shown a tendency to 
      more frequent paternal transmission of expanded alleles in SCA1 and maternal in 
      SCA7. All SCA1 and SCA2 expanded alleles analyzed consisted of pure CAG repeats, 
      whereas normal alleles were interrupted by 1-2 CAT trinucleotides in SCA1, except 
      for three alleles of 6, 14 and 21 CAG repeats, and by 1-3 CAA trinucleotides in 
      SCA2. No SCA or DRPLA mutations were detected in the 60 sporadic cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia, but one late onset patient was identified as a recessive 
      form due to GAA-repeat expansions in the Friedreich's ataxia gene.

TI  - Mapping of a new autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia to chromosome 22.
PG  - 594-9
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) are a clinically and 
      genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. The clinical symptoms include 
      cerebellar dysfunction and associated signs from dysfunction in other parts of 
      the nervous system. So far, five spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) genes have been 
      identified: SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7. Loci for SCA4 and SCA5 have been 
      mapped. However, approximately one-third of SCAs have remained unassigned. We 
      have identified a Mexican American pedigree that segregates a new form of ataxia 
      clinically characterized by gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus. Two 
      individuals have seizures. After excluding all known genetic loci for linkage, we 
      performed a genomewide search and identified linkage to a 15-cM region on 
      chromosome 22q13. A maximum LOD score of 4.3 (recombination fraction 0) was 
      obtained for D22S928 and D22S1161. This distinct form of ataxia has been 
      designated "SCA10." Anticipation was observed in the available parent-child 
      pairs, suggesting that trinucleotide-repeat expansion may be the mutagenic 
      mechanism.

TI  - Incidence of dominant spinocerebellar and Friedreich triplet repeats among 361 
      ataxia families.
PG  - 1666-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 
      3, 6, and 7 and Friedreich's ataxia (FA) among a large panel of ataxia families. 
      BACKGROUND: The ataxias are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative diseases that variably affect the cerebellum, brainstem, and 
      spinocerebellar tracts. Trinucleotide repeat expansions have been shown to be the 
      mutational mechanism for five dominantly inherited SCAs as well as FA. METHODS: 
      We collected DNA samples and clinical data from patients representing 361 
      families with adult-onset ataxia of unknown etiology. Patients with a clinical 
      diagnosis of FA were specifically excluded from our collection. RESULTS: Among 
      the 178 dominant kindreds, we found SCA1 expansion at a frequency of 5.6%, SCA2 
      expansion at a frequency of 15.2%, SCA3 expansion at a frequency of 20.8%, SCA6 
      expansion at a frequency of 15.2%, and SCA7 expansion at a frequency of 4.5%. FA 
      alleles were found in 11.4% of apparently recessive and 5.2% of apparently 
      sporadic patients. Among these patients the repeat sizes for one or both FA 
      alleles were relatively small, with sizes for the smaller allele ranging from 90 
      to 600 GAA repeats. The clinical presentation for these patients is atypical for 
      FA, with one or more of the following characteristics: adult onset of disease, 
      retained tendon reflexes, normal plantar response, and intact or partially intact 
      sensory perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogenic trinucleotide repeat expansions were 
      found among 61% of the dominant kindreds. Among patients with apparently 
      recessive or negative family histories of ataxia, 6.8% and 4.4% tested positive 
      for a CAG expansion at one of the dominant loci, and 11.4 and 5.2% of patients 
      with apparently recessive or sporadic forms of ataxia had FA expansions. Because 
      of the significant implications that a dominant versus recessive inheritance 
      pattern has for future generations, it is important to screen patients who do not 
      have a clearly dominant inheritance pattern for expansions at both the FA and the 
      dominant ataxia loci.

TI  - Close associations between prevalences of dominantly inherited spinocerebellar 
      ataxias with CAG-repeat expansions and frequencies of large normal CAG alleles in 
      Japanese and Caucasian populations.
PG  - 1060-6
AB  - To test the hypothesis that the frequencies of normal alleles (ANs) with a 
      relatively large number of CAG repeats (large ANs) are related to the prevalences 
      of the dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs)-SCA types 1, 2, 3 (Machado-Joseph 
      disease), 6, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA)-we investigated the 
      relative prevalences of these diseases in 202 Japanese and 177 Caucasian families 
      and distributions of the number of CAG repeats of ANs at these disease loci in 
      normal individuals in each population. The relative prevalences of SCA1 and SCA2 
      were significantly higher in Caucasian pedigrees (15% and 14%, respectively) than 
      in Japanese pedigrees (3% and 5%, respectively), corresponding to the observation 
      that the frequencies of large ANs of SCA1 (alleles >30 repeats) and of SCA2 
      (alleles >22 repeats) were significantly higher in Caucasians than in Japanese. 
      The relative prevalences of MJD/SCA3, SCA6, and DRPLA were significantly higher 
      in Japanese pedigrees (43%, 11%, and 20%, respectively) than in Caucasian 
      pedigrees (30%, 5%, and 0%, respectively), corresponding to the observation that 
      the frequencies of large ANs of MJD/SCA3 (>27 repeats), SCA6 (>13 repeats), and 
      DRPLA (>17 repeats) were significantly higher in Japanese than in Caucasians. The 
      close correlations of the relative prevalences of the dominant SCAs with the 
      distributions of large ANs strongly support the assumption that large ANs 
      contribute to generation of expanded alleles (AEs) and the relative prevalences 
      of the dominant SCAs.

TI  - CAG repeat expansions in patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 55-9
AB  - CAG repeat expansions cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), SCA2, SCA3, 
      SCA6 and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). So far these expansions 
      have been examined mainly in ataxia patients with a family history. However, some 
      sporadic cases with SCA have recently been reported. To elucidate the frequency 
      and characteristics of sporadic SCAs, we screened 85 Japanese ataxia patients 
      without a family history for the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and DRPLA mutations. As a 
      result, 19 patients (22%) were found to have expanded CAG repeats. Among sporadic 
      SCAs, the SCA6 mutation was most frequently observed. The sporadic SCA6 patients 
      had smaller CAG repeats and a later age of onset than SCA6 patients with an 
      established family history. We also identified one father-child pair in which 
      intermediate sized CAG repeats expanded into the SCA2 disease range during 
      transmission. These findings suggest that patients with ataxia even without a 
      family history should be examined for a CAG repeat expansion.

      huntingtin.
PG  - 215-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe characteristics of gene-negative patients with clinical 
      features of Huntington's disease (HD), exploring likely etiologies. BACKGROUND: 
      When a direct gene test became definitive for diagnosis of HD, we discovered a 
      number of patients in our clinics in Baltimore, MD, and Cambridge, UK, believed 
      or suspected to have HD who did not have the triplet repeat expansion. METHODS: 
      Patients were examined using standardized instruments, and given full neurologic 
      and psychiatric evaluations. Those negative for HD were tested for 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy, SCA-1, SCA-3, SCA-2, SCA-6, and other 
      conditions as indicated. RESULTS: Of 15 patients, 7 received specific diagnoses 
      or appear to be sporadic cases, 4 have a possible but uncertain relation to HD, 
      and 4 have unknown familial progressive movement disorders. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      last group of patients might be properly described as phenocopies of HD, some of 
      which may be caused by unidentified triplet repeat expansions.

TI  - Expanded polyglutamine protein forms nuclear inclusions and causes neural 
      degeneration in Drosophila.
PG  - 939-49
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3/MJD) is one of at least eight human 
      neurodegenerative diseases caused by glutamine-repeat expansion. We have 
      recreated glutamine-repeat disease in Drosophila using a segment of the SCA3/MJD 
      protein. Targeted expression of the protein with an expanded polyglutamine repeat 
      led to nuclear inclusion (NI) formation and late-onset cell degeneration. 
      Differential sensitivity to the mutant transgene was observed among different 
      cell types, with neurons being particularly susceptible; NI formation alone was 
      not sufficient for degeneration. The viral antiapoptotic gene P35 mitigated 
      polyglutamine-induced degeneration in vivo. Our results demonstrate that cellular 
      mechanisms of human glutamine-repeat disease are conserved in invertebrates. This 
      fly model will aid in identifying additional factors that modulate 
      neurodegeneration.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7): a neurodegenerative disorder with neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusions.
PG  - 913-8
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with progressive macular degeneration is 
      caused by a CAG/glutamine repeat expansion in the SCA7 gene/protein. Neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusions were detected in the brain of an early onset SCA7 case 
      with the 1C2 antibody directed against an expanded polyglutamine domain. Nuclear 
      inclusions were most frequent in the inferior olivary complex, a site of severe 
      neuronal loss in SCA7. They were also observed in other brain regions, including 
      the cerebral cortex, not considered to be affected in the disease. Using confocal 
      microscopy we showed that some inclusions were ubiquitinated, but to varying 
      degrees, ranging from <1% in the cerebral cortex to 60% in the inferior olive. In 
      addition, we also observed cytoplasmic staining using the 1C2 antibody, 
      particularly in the supramarginal gyrus, the hippocampus, the thalamus, the 
      lateral geniculate body and the pontine nuclei. These data confirm that the 
      presence of intranuclear inclusions in neurons is a common characteristic of 
      disorders caused by CAG/polyglutamine expansions, but unlike what has been 
      reported for Huntington's disease, SCA1 and SCA3/MJD, in SCA7 the inclusions were 
      not restricted to the sites of severe neuronal loss.

TI  - Machado-Joseph disease in three Scandinavian families.
PG  - 152-7
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative disorder characterized by varying age of onset and pronounced 
      phenotypic heterogeneity. The clinical core features include gait ataxia, 
      external ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, and bulging eyes. Recently, Kawagushi et al. 
      (1994) cloned the MJD1 gene on chromosome 14 and MJD turned out to be the fifth 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by an unstable CAG repeat expansion. We have 
      studied two large Danish families and one Norwegian family with MJD. Three 
      features not previously associated with MJD are reported: dementia, generalized 
      muscle and joint pain, and in one case neuropathological examination revealed 
      atrophy of the inferior olives. We found a significant inverse correlation 
      between age of onset and the length of the CAG repeat expansion, and anticipation 
      is described through four succeeding generations. Instability of the CAG repeat 
      expansion was most pronounced at paternal transmission.

TI  - Maternal anticipation in Machado-Joseph disease (MJD): some maternal factors 
      independent of the number of CAG repeat units may play a role in genetic 
      anticipation in a Japanese MJD family.
PG  - 141-5
AB  - We studied the relationship between the number of CAG repeat units in the MJD1 
      gene and clinical features of Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) in eight patients from 
      two generations of a Japanese MJD family. Because of lack of characteristic 
      clinical signs of MJD such as dystonia, bulging eyes or facial myokymia, clinical 
      diagnosis of MJD in this family was difficult to make prior to molecular testing 
      for the CAG repeat expansion in the MJD1 gene. All the patients exhibited 
      maternal transmission of MJD, and the intergenerational change in the number of 
      CAG repeat units in the MJD1 gene was very small (+0.5+/-0.3, mean+/-S.E.M., n=4) 
      in spite of marked genetic anticipation (-17.0 years/generation). In the present 
      family, the degree of anticipation per repeat unit in maternal transmissions was 
      much larger than that in maternal transmissions in the other six MJD families. 
      This indicates that some maternal factors other than the increase of the number 
      of CAG repeat units, which is known to be the basis of anticipation, may play a 
      role in genetic anticipation in this MJD family.

TI  - The role of the SCA2 trinucleotide repeat expansion in 89 autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia families. Frequency, clinical and genetic correlates.
PG  - 459-67
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is caused by a trinucleotide (CAG) 
      expansion in the coding region of the ataxin 2 gene on chromosome 12q.89 families 
      with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) types I, II and III, and 47 
      isolated cases with idiopathic late onset cerebellar ataxia (ILOCA), were 
      analysed for this mutation. The identification of the SCA2 mutation in 31 out of 
      38 families with the ADCA I phenotype, but in none of those with ADCA II, ADCA 
      III or ILOCA confirms the specificity of this mutation. A clinical comparison of 
      the ADCA I patients with the three known mutations (SCA1, -2 or -3) highlights 
      significant differences between the groups; SCA2 patients tended to have a longer 
      disease duration, a higher frequency of slow saccades and depressed tendon 
      reflexes. However, these neurological signs were also seen in an ADCA I family in 
      which the SCA2 mutation was not identified, illustrating the importance of a 
      direct genetic test. The SCA2 families were from different geographical and 
      ethnic backgrounds. However, haplotype analysis failed to show evidence of a 
      founder mutation, even in families from the same geographical origin. The range 
      of normal alleles varied from 17 to 30 CAG repeats and from 35 to 51 repeats for 
      the pathological alleles. Similar to the other diseases caused by unstable 
      trinucleotide repeats, a significant inverse correlation has been found between 
      the number of repeats and age of onset, and there is a significantly higher 
      paternal instability of repeat length on transmission to offspring. The SCA2 
      mutation is the most frequent amongst ADCA I patients, accounting for 40%, 
      compared with SCA1 and SCA3 which account for 35% and 15%, respectively.

TI  - Large CAG/CTG repeat templates produced by PCR, usefulness for the DIRECT method 
      of cloning genes with CAG/CTG repeat expansions.
PG  - 1352-3
AB  - We report here a simple method for generating large CAG/CTG repeat sequences. We 
      have applied this method to clone the genomic sequence containing the CAG/CTG 
      repeat and its upstream intronic sequence present in spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3 or Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) by a modified DIRECT method. With these 
      modifications we have considerably simplified the generation of the repeat probe 
      used to screen for anomalous bands. This method will facilitate the molecular 
      approach to other genetic disorders where expansions of repeat sequences could be 
      involved.

TI  - Uncloned expanded CAG/CTG repeat sequences in autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia (ADCA) detected by the repeat expansion detection (RED) method.
PG  - 99-102
AB  - In some neurodegenerative diseases, genetic anticipation correlates with 
      expansions of the CAG/CTG repeat sequence above the normal range through the 
      generations of a pedigree. Among these neurodegenerative diseases are late onset 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA). ADCA are genetically heterogeneous 
      disorders with different cloned genes for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), 
      type 2 (SCA2), type 3 or Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), and type 6 (SCA6). 
      Another related dominant ataxia, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), 
      also shows CAG/CTG repeat expansions. Genetic anticipation has been reported for 
      all of them except for the recently cloned SCA6 gene. Other, as yet undetected 
      SCA genes may show the same features. We have used the repeat expansion detection 
      (RED) method to detect repeat expansions directly in DNA samples from ADCA 
      patients not resulting from known genes. Our sample consists of 19 affected index 
      cases, corresponding to 52.8% of our ADCA families without CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions in the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, or DRPLA genes. Eighty-nine percent 
      of the index cases had expansions of a CAG/CTG sequence greater than 40 repeats 
      by RED, while these were observed in only 26.9% of 78 healthy subjects from the 
      general population (p < 0.0001). The distribution of RED fragments in controls 
      and ADCA patients also shows significant differences with the Mann-Whitney U test 
      (U = 376.5, p = 0.0007). Moreover, there was a significant inverse correlation 
      between the size of expansion and the age of onset (r = -0.54, p = 0.018). These 
      results show CAG/CTG repeat expansions of over 40 repeats in our sample of ADCA 
      families not resulting from known SCA genes.

TI  - Somatic mosaicism of the CAG repeat expansion in spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3/Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 23-7
AB  - An expanded and unstable CAG repeat in the coding region of the MJD1 gene is the 
      mutation responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia 3/Machado-Joseph disease. In 
      order to determine whether there was a higher degree of instability in affected 
      regions, the size of the expanded CAG repeat was analyzed in different regions of 
      the central nervous system, in two unrelated SCA3/MJD patients. The degree of 
      somatic mosaicism was quantified and compared to that in a SCA1 patient. 
      Instability of the expanded CAG repeat was observed in peripheral tissues as well 
      as in CNS of the three patients, but there was no correlation between the degree 
      of mosaicism and the selective vulnerability of CNS structures. As in the other 
      diseases caused by expanded CAG repeats, a lower degree of mosaicism was found in 
      the cerebellar cortex of both SCA1 and SCA3/MJD patients, probably reflecting 
      specific properties of this structure. In SCA3/MJD, the degree of mosaicism 
      seemed to correlate with age at death rather than with the size of the expanded 
      CAG repeat. Finally, somatic instability was more pronounced in SCA1 than in 
      SCA3/MJD patients.

TI  - Polymorphisms at 13 expressed human sequences containing CAG/CTG repeats and 
      analysis in autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) patients.
PG  - 18-21
AB  - Genetic anticipation--increasing severity and a decrease in the age of onset with 
      successive generations of a pedigree--is clearly present in autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia (ADCA). Anticipation is correlated with expansion of the 
      CAG/CTG repeat sequence to sizes above those in the normal range through the 
      generations of a pedigree. Genetic heterogeneity has been demonstrated for ADCA, 
      with four cloned genes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, and SCA6) and three mapped loci 
      (SCA4, SCA5 and SCA7). Another related dominant ataxia, 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), presents anticipation with CAG/CTG 
      repeat expansions. We had previously analysed ADCA patients who had not shown 
      repeat expansions in cloned genes for CAG/CTG repeat expansions by the repeat 
      expansion detection method (RED) and had detected expansions of between 48 and 88 
      units in 17 unrelated familial cases. We present here an analysis of 13 genes and 
      expressed sequence tags (ESTs) containing 10 or more CAG/CTG repeat sequences 
      selected from public databases in the 17 unrelated ADCA patients. Of the 13 
      selected genes and ESTs, 9 were found to be polymorphic with heterozygosities 
      ranging between 0.09 and 0.80 and 2 to 17 alleles. In ADCA patients none of the 
      loci showed expansions above the normal range of the CAG/CTG repeat sequences, 
      excluding them as the mutation causing ADCA.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6. Molecular and clinical features of 35 Japanese 
      patients including one homozygous for the CAG repeat expansion.
PG  - 1238-43
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a newly classified autosomal-dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) associated with CAG repeat expansion. We screened 111 
      patients with cerebellar ataxia for the SCA6 mutation. Of these, 35 patients were 
      found to have expanded CAG repeats in the SCA6 gene, indicating that second to 
      SCA3, SCA6 is the most common ADCA in Japan. Expanded alleles ranged from 21 to 
      29 repeats, whereas normal alleles had seven to 17 repeats. There was no change 
      in the CAG repeat length during meiosis. The age at onset was inversely 
      correlated with the repeat length. The main clinical feature of the 35 patients 
      with SCA6 was slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia; multisystem involvement was 
      not common. The 35 patients included nine cases without apparent family history 
      of cerebellar ataxia. The sporadic cases had smaller CAG repeats (21 or 22 
      repeats) and a later age at onset (64.9 +/- 4.9 years) than the other cases with 
      established family history. We also identified one patient who was homozygous for 
      the SCA6 repeat expansion. The homozygote showed an earlier age of onset and more 
      severe clinical manifestations than her sister, a heterozygote carrying an 
      expanded allele with the same repeat length as the homozygote. This finding 
      suggests that the dosage of the CAG repeat expansion plays an important role in 
      phenotypic expression in SCA6.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia: phenotypic differences in genetically 
      defined subtypes?
PG  - 924-32
AB  - Seventy-seven families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia were analyzed 
      for the CAG repeat expansions causing spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 
      and 6. The SCA1 mutation accounted for 9%, SCA2 for 10%, SCA3 for 42%, and SCA6 
      for 22% of German ataxia families. Seven of 27 SCA6 patients had no family 
      history of ataxia. Age at onset correlated inversely with repeat length in all 
      subtypes. Yet the average effect of one CAG unit on onset age was different for 
      each SCA subtype. We compared clinical, electrophysiological, and magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) findings to identify phenotypic characteristics of 
      genetically defined SCA subtypes. Slow saccades, hyporeflexia, myoclonus, and 
      action tremor proposed SCA2. SCA3 patients frequently developed diplopia, severe 
      spasticity or pronounced peripheral neuropathy, and impaired temperature 
      discrimination, apart from ataxia. SCA6 presented with a predominantly cerebellar 
      syndrome and patients often had onset after 55 years of age. SCA1 was 
      characterized by markedly prolonged peripheral and central motor conduction times 
      in motor evoked potentials. MRI scans showed pontine and cerebellar atrophy in 
      SCA1 and SCA2. In SCA3, enlargement of the fourth ventricle was the main sequel 
      of atrophy. SCA6 presented with pure cerebellar atrophy on MRI. However, overlap 
      between the four SCA subtypes was broad.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6: CAG repeat expansion in alpha1A voltage-dependent 
      calcium channel gene and clinical variations in Japanese population.
PG  - 879-84
AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are clinically and genetically 
      a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, mild CAG repeat 
      expansion in the alpha1A voltage-dependent calcium channel gene has been found to 
      be associated with a type of autosomal dominant SCA (SCA6). We analyzed 98 
      Japanese families with autosomal dominant SCAs, for whom CAG repeat expansions of 
      the SCA1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy genes were excluded, and 5 apparently sporadic cases of cortical 
      cerebellar atrophy. The diagnosis of SCA6 was confirmed in 30 families (31%) 
      comprising 47 affected individuals and 1 sporadic case. The size of expanded CAG 
      repeats ranged from 21 to 26 repeat units and was found to be correlated 
      inversely with age at onset. We identified 2 SCA6 patients homozygous for 
      expanded CAG repeats, whose ages at onset were earlier than the 95% lower 
      confidence level, suggesting the presence of a gene dosage effect of expanded CAG 
      repeat. Ataxia is the most common initial symptom found in 45 of the 48 patients. 
      Patients with a prolonged disease course showed other accompanying clinical 
      features including dystonic postures, involuntary movements, and abnormalities in 
      tendon reflexes.

TI  - The expansion of the CAG repeat in ataxin-2 is a frequent cause of autosomal 
      dominant spinocerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 1009-13
AB  - The autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (ADSCAs) are a heterogeneous group 
      of late-onset neurodegenerative disorders with overlapping clinical features. 
      Genetic linkage studies have identified at least seven distinct loci for the 
      ADSCAs, allowing the genetic classification of these disorders. The 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) locus was mapped to chromosome 12, and a 
      gene responsible for this disorder was recently isolated. The mutation causing 
      SCA2 is an expansion of a trinucleotide CAG repeat contained within the coding 
      region of a novel gene. We describe the results of genotypic analysis for the 
      SCA2 repeat in individuals with ADSCA who were previously found negative for CAG 
      repeat expansions in the SCA1, SCA3, or SCA6 genes. The expanded CAG repeat has 
      been identified in 15 independent families. Repeat instability and anticipation 
      were observed in two large kindreds. The SCA2 mutation was found in 18% of our 
      ADSCA kindreds, confirming the high proportion of SCA2 among this group of 
      disorders.

TI  - Intranuclear inclusions of expanded polyglutamine protein in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 3.
PG  - 333-44
AB  - The mechanism of neurodegeneration in CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion diseases 
      is unknown but is thought to occur at the protein level. Here, in studies of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), 
      we show that the disease protein ataxin-3 accumulates in ubiquitinated 
      intranuclear inclusions selectively in neurons of affected brain regions. We 
      further provide evidence in vitro for a model of disease in which an expanded 
      polyglutamine-containing fragment recruits full-length protein into insoluble 
      aggregates. Together with recent findings from transgenic models, our results 
      suggest that intranuclear aggregation of the expanded protein is a unifying 
      feature of CAG/polyglutamine diseases and may be initiated or catalyzed by a 
      glutamine-containing fragment of the disease protein.

TI  - SCA6 is caused by moderate CAG expansion in the alpha1A-voltage-dependent calcium 
      channel gene.
PG  - 1289-93
AB  - Recently, moderate (CAG)>20 repeat expansions in the alpha1A-voltage-dependent 
      calcium channel gene (CACNL1A4) have been identified in a previously unmapped 
      type of SCA which has been named SCA6. We investigated the (CAG)n repeat length 
      of the CACNL1A4 gene in 733 patients with sporadic ataxia and in 46 German 
      families with dominantly inherited SCA which do not harbor the SCA1, SCA2, or 
      MJD1/SCA3 mutation, respectively. The SCA6 (CAG)n expansion was identified in 32 
      patients most frequently with late manifestation of the disease. The (CAG)n 
      stretch of the affected allele varied between 22 and 28 trinucleotide units and 
      is therefore the shortest trinucleotide repeat expansion causing spinocerebellar 
      ataxia. The (CAG)n repeat length is inversely correlated with the age at onset. 
      In 11 parental transmissions of the expanded allele no repeat instability has 
      been observed. Repeat instability was also not found for the normal allele 
      investigating 431 meioses in the CEPH families. Analyzing 248 apparently healthy 
      octogenerians revealed one allele of 18 repeats which is the longest normal CAG 
      repeat in the CACNL1A4 gene reported. The SCA6 mutation causes the disease in 
      approximately 10% of autosomal dominant SCA in Germany. Most importantly, the 
      trinucleotide expansion was observed in four ataxia patients without obvious 
      family history of the disease which necessitates a search for the SCA6 (CAG)n 
      expansion even in sporadic patients.

TI  - Studies of the CAG repeat in the Machado-Joseph disease gene in Taiwan.
PG  - 155-62
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      degeneration characterized by cerebellar ataxia and pyramidal signs associated in 
      varying degrees with a dystonic-rigid extrapyramidal syndrome or peripheral 
      amyotrophy. Unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the MJD gene on the 
      long arm of chromosome 14 has been identified as the pathological mutation for 
      MJD. While investigating the distribution of CAG repeat lengths of the MJD gene 
      in Taiwan's population, we have identified 18 MJD-affected patients and 12 
      at-risk individuals in seven families. In addition, we have analyzed the range of 
      CAG repeat lengths in 96 control individuals. The CAG repeat number ranged from 
      13 to 44 in the controls and 72-85 in the affected and at-risk individuals. Our 
      results indicated that the CAG repeat number was inversely correlated with the 
      age of onset. The differences in CAG repeat length between parent and child and 
      between siblings are greater with paternal transmission than maternal 
      transmission. Our data show a tendency towards the phenomenon of anticipation in 
      the MJD families but do not support unidirectional expansion of CAG repeats 
      during transmission. We also demonstrated that PCR amplification of the CAG 
      repeats in the MJD gene from villous DNA was possible and might prove useful as a 
      diagnostic tool for affected families in the future.

TI  - SCA2 trinucleotide expansion in German SCA patients.
PG  - 59-64
AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a group of clinically and 
      genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders which lead to progressive 
      cerebellar ataxia. A gene responsible for SCA type 2 has been mapped to human 
      chromosome 12 and the disease causing mutation has been identified as an unstable 
      and expanded (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat. We investigated the (CAG)n repeat 
      length of the SCA2 gene in 842 patients with sporadic ataxia and in 96 German 
      families with dominantly inherited SCA which do not harbor the SCA1 or MJD1/SCA3 
      mutation, respectively. The SCA2 (CAG)n expansion was identified in 71 patients 
      from 54 families. The (CAG)n stretch of the affected allele varied between 36 and 
      64 trinucleotide units. Significant repeat expansions occurred most commonly 
      during paternal transmission. Analysis of the (CAG)n repeat lengths with the age 
      of onset in 41 patients revealed an inverse correlation. Two hundred and 
      forty-one apparently healthy octogenerians carried alleles between 16 and 31 
      repeats. One 50-year old, healthy individual had 34 repeats; she had transmitted 
      an expanded allele to her child. The small difference between 'normal' and 
      disease alleles makes it necessary to define the extreme values of their ranges. 
      With one exception, the trinucleotide expansion was not observed in 842 ataxia 
      patients without a family history of the disease. The SCA2 mutation causes the 
      disease in nearly 14% of autosomal dominant SCA in Germany.

TI  - Brain regional differences in the expansion of a CAG repeat in the 
      spinocerebellar ataxias: dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, Machado-Joseph 
      disease, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.
PG  - 505-11
AB  - Three autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA), Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 
      (SCA1), are associated with the expansion of a CAG repeat in the respective 
      genes. To investigate the association between CAG repeat expansion and 
      neuropathological findings, we analyzed several brain regions from 9 cases of 
      DRPLA, 3 cases of MJD, and 1 case of SCA1. We found that the expanded alleles 
      were smaller in the cerebellar cortex than in other brain regions, such as the 
      frontal cortex, in these three diseases. The discrepancy in the expanded CAG 
      repeat length between cerebellar cortex and other tissues was most prominent in 
      DRPLA, and especially in cases of adult-onset DRPLA. A significant correlation 
      was found between the age at onset of DRPLA and the size of the CAG repeat 
      expansion. Cerebella of DRPLA patients were microscopically dissected into three 
      layers, the molecular and granular layers and the white matter, which were 
      analyzed separately. The lower level of CAG repeat expansion in DRPLA cerebella 
      was representative of CAG repeat expansion in the granule cells. The 
      microdissected samples of the granular layer of the hippocampal formation, which 
      is densely packed with neuronal cells, revealed that the degree of CAG repeat 
      expansion in this layer was similar to that in the cerebellum. These observations 
      suggest that granule cells in the cerebellum and hippocampus have low levels of 
      CAG repeat expansion, and that other types of cells exhibit a higher level of CAG 
      repeat expansion, in spinocerebellar ataxias.

TI  - The prevalence and wide clinical spectrum of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      trinucleotide repeat in patients with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 842-50
AB  - The dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) represent a clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of disorders linked by progressive deterioration in balance 
      and coordination. The utility of genetic classification of the ADCAs has been 
      highlighted by the striking variability in clinical phenotype observed within 
      families and the overlap in clinical phenotype observed between those with 
      different genotypes. The recent demonstration that spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      (SCA2) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion within the ataxin-2 gene has allowed 
      us to determine the frequency of SCA2 compared with SCA1, SCA3/Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD), and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) in patients with 
      sporadic and inherited ataxia. SCA2 accounts for 13% of patients with ADCA 
      (without retinal degeneration), intermediate between SCA1 and SCA3/MJD, which 
      account for 6% and 23%, respectively. Together, SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3/MJD 
      constitute >40% of the mutations leading to ADCA I in our population. No patient 
      without a family history of ataxia, or with a pure cerebellar or spastic 
      syndrome, tested positive for SCA1, SCA2, or SCA3. No overlap in ataxin-2 allele 
      size between normal and disease chromosomes, or intermediate-sized alleles, were 
      observed. Repeat length correlated inversely with age at onset, accounting for 
      approximately 80% of the variability in onset age. Haplotype analysis provided no 
      evidence for a single founder chromosome, and diverse ethnic origins were 
      observed among SCA2 kindreds. In addition, a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes 
      was observed among SCA2 patients, including typical mild dominant ataxia, the MJD 
      phenotype with facial fasciculations and lid retraction, and early-onset ataxia 
      with a rapid course, chorea, and dementia.

TI  - Non-Mendelian transmission at the Machado-Joseph disease locus in normal females: 
      preferential transmission of alleles with smaller CAG repeats.
PG  - 234-6
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, is a 
      neurodegenerative disorder which is associated with a CAG repeat expansion in the 
      MJD1 gene on chromosome 14q32.1. A recent study reported an excess of 
      transmission of disease chromosomes relative to normal chromosomes from affected 
      fathers, while this phenomenon was not observed in female meioses. These data 
      were compatible with meiotic drive. We investigated the transmission of alleles 
      with larger versus smaller CAG repeat numbers in the MJD1 gene in normal 
      heterozygotes from the 40 CEPH families. Our data suggest that there was no 
      segregation distortion in male meioses, while the smaller CAG allele was 
      inherited in 57% of female meioses (p < 0.016). The pattern of inheritance of 
      smaller versus larger CAG alleles at this locus was significantly different when 
      male and female meioses were compared (p = 0.0139). While previous data suggest 
      that meiotic drive may be a feature of certain human diseases, including the 
      trinucleotide diseases MJD, myotonic dystrophy, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy, these data are compatible with meiotic drive also occurring among 
      non-disease associated CAG sizes.

PG  - 275-8
AB  - We estimated the relative contributions of known ataxia genes (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 
      and X25) in the patient population sent to our DNA diagnostic laboratory for 
      diagnostic testing. Approximately 28% of these patients had an abnormal triplet 
      repeat expansion in one of these ataxia genes (3% for SCA1, 8% for SCA2, 11% for 
      SCA3/MJD, 2% for SCA6, 3% for SCA7, and 1.5% for X25). The lack of abnormal 
      repeat expansions in the majority of ataxis patients tested suggests that the 
      molecular defects associated with most ataxia cases are currently undetermined 
      and that this population includes both familial and sporadic cases. In contrast, 
      of the patients submitted for genetic testing for Friedrich's ataxia (FRDA), 44% 
      (69/157) showed at least one expansion in the X25 gene, indicating that FRDA 
      accounts for a significant proportion of the recessively inherited ataxias and 
      appears to have a high rate of accurate clinical diagnosis. On the basis of our 
      DNA studies, we propose a comprehensive and efficient approach for molecular 
      analysis of ataxia patients.

TI  - The repeat expansion detection method in the analysis of diseases with CAG/CTG 
      repeat expansion: usefulness and limitations.
PG  - 486-8
AB  - The repeat expansion detection (RED) method was described to detect expansions of 
      trinucleotide repeats of unknown chromosomal location. We have improved the RED 
      method by the use of 8-mer oligonucleotides and assessed its usefulness in 30 
      samples from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), Huntington's 
      disease (HD), and Machado Joseph's disease (MJD), for which the number of CAG/CTG 
      repeats was determined by sequencing. There was a good correlation between the 
      number of repeats detected by sequencing and those identified by RED. However, in 
      17% of samples, the RED gave additional fragments for ligation products of 
      different size than the CAG/CTG repeat expansion detected in the sample by 
      sequencing. The same was observed in a group of control subjects (n = 78) without 
      known clinical abnormalities in which products of more than 40 repeats were 
      detected in 27% of them, indicating that CAG/CTG repeat expansions are common in 
      the general population. Wether this corresponds to unidentified loci with 
      expansions deserves further investigation.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias in the Kinki area of Japan.
PG  - 399-406
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders characterized by slowly progressive cerebellar 
      ataxia. Recently, among the ataxias, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy have been 
      found to be caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the coding 
      region of the disease genes. We have analyzed the CAG repeats of 67 patients from 
      47 families with dominantly inherited ataxia who lived in the Kinki area of 
      Japan. The following results were obtained. First, 31 patients from 22 families 
      were found to be positive for the MJD repeat expansion, indicating that MJD is 
      the most common dominantly inherited ataxia in the Kinki area of Japan. Second, 
      no SCA1 repeat expansion was found among the families studied. This presents a 
      striking contrast to the fact that there are many families with SCA1 in Hokkaido 
      and the Tohoku area of Japan. These findings suggest geographic variation in 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias in Japan.

TI  - The relationship between trinucleotide repeat length and phenotypic variation in 
      Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 52-7
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansion in the Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) gene has been 
      found in 26 patients from 20 unrelated Japanese families. Expanded alleles had 68 
      to 84 repeats, whereas normal alleles had 14 to 37 repeats. The age of onset was 
      inversely correlated with the repeat length. To evaluate in detail the 
      relationship between the repeat length and clinical features, we subdivided the 
      26 patients into three groups on the basis of the repeat length (group 1, 78 
      repeats or more; group 2, 74 to 77 repeats; group 3, 73 repeats or less). Group 1 
      and group 2 had common features of spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, 
      bulging eyes, facial myokymia and extrapyramidal signs as well as cerebellar 
      ataxia and ophthalmoplegia. It should be noted that group 1 showed more prominent 
      pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs than group 2. In contrast, group 3 showed 
      hypotonia, hyporeflexia and sensory disturbance in addition to cerebellar ataxia 
      and ophthalmoplegia. These findings suggest that the repeat length plays an 
      important role in phenotypic variation. DNA analysis for the MJD mutation was 
      clearly useful for making an accurate diagnosis in patients without bulging eyes, 
      facial myokymia, dystonia or marked spasticity.

TI  - Electrophysiological findings in a Danish family with Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 743-50
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with autosomal 
      dominant inheritance, We have carried out electrophysiological studies in 8 
      individuals belonging to a Danish family with several affected members. Five had 
      an expanded trinucleotide (CAG) repeat sequence in the MJD1 gene on chromosome 14 
      indicating MJD, while 3 unaffected individuals had normal repeat lengths. Three 
      individuals with repeat expansion had clinical symptoms and signs of the Machado 
      or "type III" phenotype, whereas 2 had slight symptoms and signs only, 
      Electrophysiological evaluation included visual, somatosensory, and auditory 
      brain stem evoked potentials, quantitative electromyography, and nerve conduction 
      studies. In the patients with clinical MJD, evoked potential studies showed 
      multimodal abnormalities, electromyography showed neurogenic changes, and nerve 
      conduction studies showed signs of severe loss of motor and sensory nerve fibers. 
      Of the 2 patients with slight symptoms and signs, 1 had evidence of peripheral 
      and central affection, while the other had slight signs of a central affection. 
      This study provides insight into the distribution and character of 
      electrophysiological abnormalities in MJD of putative importance for an 
      understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, and for monitoring disease 
      progress, or the outcome of a possible treatment.

TI  - Non-Mendelian transmission in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and 
      Machado-Joseph disease: the mutant allele is preferentially transmitted in male 
      meiosis.
PG  - 730-3
AB  - Autosomal dominant dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) are neurodegenerative disorders caused by CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions. An inverse correlation of age at onset with the 
      length of the expanded CAG trinucleotide repeats has been demonstrated, and the 
      intergenerational instability of the length of the CAG trinucleotide repeats, 
      which is more prominent in paternal than in maternal transmissions, has been 
      shown to underlie the basic mechanisms of anticipation in DRPLA and MJD. Our 
      previous observations on DRPLA and MJD pedigrees, as well as a review of the 
      literature, have suggested that the numbers of affected offspring exceed those of 
      unaffected offspring, which is difficult to explain by the Mendelian principle of 
      random segregation of alleles. In the present study, we analyzed the segregation 
      patterns in 211 transmissions in 24 DRPLA pedigrees and 80 transmissions in 7 MJD 
      pedigrees, with the diagnoses confirmed by molecular testing. Significant 
      distortions in favor of transmission of the mutant alleles were found in male 
      meiosis, where the mutant alleles were transmitted to 62% of all offspring in 
      DRPLA (chi2 = 7.69; P<.01) and 73% in MJD (chi2 = 6.82; P<.01). The results were 
      consistent with meiotic drive in DRPLA and MJD. Since more prominent meiotic 
      instability of the length of the CAG trinucleotide repeats is observed in male 
      meiosis than in female meiosis and meiotic drive is observed only in male 
      meiosis, these results raise the possibility that a common molecular mechanism 
      underlies the meiotic drive and the meiotic instability in male meiosis.

      disease, and X-linked recessive spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 43-50
AB  - We investigated the somatic mosaicism of trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 
      neural and nonneural tissues of a dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) 
      patient and their correlation to the topographical distribution of the 
      pathological involvement. The spatial pattern of tissue-specific somatic 
      mosaicism in the CAG repeat size was significantly different among the DRPLA, MJD 
      and SBMA patients. The size of the major bands of the mutant CAG repeat allele 
      was significantly smaller in the cerebellar cortex in both DRPLA and MJD patients 
      by 6 and 2 repeat units respectively and larger in the colon and liver of DRPLA 
      by 5 repeats or more. There were also 1-2 repeat-sized small variations of major 
      band size among the neural tissues in DRPLA. In contrast, there was no 
      tissue-specific variation of major bands of CAG repeats and diversity of extra 
      bands among the examined tissues including the cerebellum in the SBMA patient. 
      There was no parallel occurrence of tissue-specific CAG instability and severity 
      of neuropathological involvement in the neural and nonneural tissues of DRPLA, 
      MJD and SBMA patients. Lack of significant tissue-specific somatic mosaicism in 
      SBMA including the cerebellar cortex may suggest that CAG repeat expansion in the 
      mutant androgen receptor gene is far more stable compared with that in DRPLA and 
      MJD as well as those reported in Huntington's disease.

TI  - Mutation detection in Machado-Joseph disease using repeat expansion detection.
PG  - 77-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several neurological disorders have recently been explained through 
      the discovery of expanded DNA repeat sequences. Among these is Machado-Joseph 
      disease, one of the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (MJD/SCA3), caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion on chromosome 14. A useful way of detecting repeat sequence 
      mutations is offered by the repeat expansion detection method (RED), in which a 
      thermostable ligase is used to detect repeat expansions directly from genomic 
      DNA. We have used RED to detect CAG expansions in families with either MJD/SCA3 
      or with previously uncharacterized spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Five MJD/SCA3 families and one SCA family where linkage to SCA1-5 had 
      been excluded were analyzed by RED and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: 
      An expansion represented by RED products of 180-270 bp segregated with MJD/SCA3 
      (p < 0.00001) in five families (n = 60) and PCR products corresponding to 66-80 
      repeat copies were observed in all affected individuals. We also detected a 
      210-bp RED product segregating with disease (p < 0.01) in a non-SCA1-5 family (n 
      = 16), suggesting involvement of a CAG expansion in the pathophysiology. PCR 
      analysis subsequently revealed an elongated MJD/SCA3 allele in all affected 
      family members. CONCLUSIONS: RED products detected in Machado-Joseph disease 
      families correlated with elongated PCR products at the MJD/SCA3 locus. We 
      demonstrate the added usefulness of RED in detecting repeat expansions in 
      disorders where linkage is complicated by phenotyping problems in gradually 
      developing adult-onset disorders, as in the non-SCA1-5 family examined. The RED 
      method is informative without any knowledge of flanking sequences. This is 
      particularly useful when studying diseases where the mutated gene is unknown. We 
      conclude that RED is a reliable method for analyzing expanded repeat sequences in 
      the genome.

TI  - Frequency of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy, 
      and Machado-Joseph disease mutations in a large group of spinocerebellar ataxia 
      patients.
PG  - 214-8
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders varying in both clinical manifestations and mode of inheritance. Six 
      different genes causing autosomal dominant SCA are mapped: SCA1, SCA2, 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA4, SCA5, and dentatorubropallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA). Expansions of an unstable trinucleotide CAG repeat cause three 
      of these disorders: SCA type 1 (SCA1), MJD, and DRPLA. We determine the frequency 
      of the SCA1, DRPLA, and MJD mutations in a large group of unrelated SCA patients 
      with various patterns of inheritance and different ethnic backgrounds. We studied 
      92 unrelated SCA patients. The frequency of the SCA1 mutation was 3% in the 
      overall patient group and 10% in the non-Portuguese dominantly inherited SCA 
      subgroup. We found that DRPLA mutation in only one Japanese patient, who was 
      previously diagnosed with this disease. We identified the MJD mutation in 41% of 
      the overall patient group, which included 38 autosomal dominant kindreds of 
      Portuguese origin; the frequency of the MJD mutation among the non-Portuguese 
      dominantly inherited cases was 17%. These results suggest that SCA may be 
      occasionally caused by the SCA1 mutation and rarely caused by the DRPLA mutation 
      and that, to date, the MJD mutation seems to be the most common cause of 
      dominantly inherited SCA. Finally, our results suggest that recessively inherited 
      cases of SCA are not caused by the known trinucleotide repeat expansions.

TI  - Mutations in American families with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 3: SCA3 is 
      allelic to Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 208-13
AB  - We identified an expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the coding region 
      of the Machado-Joseph disease gene in 7 of 24 American families diagnosed with 
      autosomal dominant ataxia. All affected individuals were heterozygous for an 
      expanded allele that ranged from 67 to more than 200 CAG repeats, whereas the 
      normal allele had 14 to 33 repeats. In contrast to the Azorean-Portuguese origins 
      of Machado-Joseph disease, the two largest American families were of German and 
      Dutch-African descent. Clinical, pathologic, and genetic evaluations suggest that 
      American families with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 differ from those with 
      Machado-Joseph disease by their ethnic origins, predominant spinopontine atrophy, 
      lack of dystonic features, and larger CAG repeat expansion.

TI  - CAG repeat expansion of Machado-Joseph disease in the Japanese: analysis of the 
      repeat instability for parental transmission, and correlation with disease 
      phenotype.
PG  - 128-33
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is caused by abnormal expansion of an unstable CAG 
      repeat in a novel gene locating on chromosome 14q32.1. We analysed this CAG 
      repeat polymorphism with 66 Japanese MJD patients. All the patients were 
      selectively associated with abnormal expansion of the CAG repeat. Repeat length 
      of the mutant allele did not overlap that of normal allele and closely correlated 
      with not only age at onset but also with clinical phenotypes. CAG repeat size is 
      apparently related to a wide variety of phenotypic presentations in MJD.

TI  - Detection of the Machado-Joseph disease/spinocerebellar ataxia three 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in families with autosomal dominant motor 
      disorders, including the Drew family of Walworth.
PG  - 1077-85
AB  - Affected members of 63 families with a variety of autosomal dominant late onset 
      cerebellar ataxias (ADCA), and 29 patients with similar phenotypes but no 
      affected relatives, were investigated for the trinucleotide (CAG) repeat 
      expansion described in Japanese families with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). This 
      disorder had previously been shown to map to the region of chromosome 14 which 
      also contains a locus causing ADCA in French families, spinocerebellar ataxia 3 
      (SCA3). The MJD/SCA3 mutation was identified in nine families with ADCA type I, 
      and a further family in which affected members had parkinsonism, peripheral 
      neuropathy, dystonia, and spasticity, but little evidence of cerebellar disease. 
      Only one of the 10 families was British (the Drew family of Walworth); the others 
      originated from India, Jamaica, Ghana, Brazil and France. There was no single 
      clinical feature which distinguished patients with the MJD/SCA3 mutation from 
      those with the CAG expansion on chromosome 6 (SCA1) or ADCA type I families with 
      no known mutation. The CAG repeat length ranged from 13-41 copies on normal 
      chromosomes and 62-80 copies on affected chromosomes. There was a significant 
      inverse correlation between age of onset of symptoms and repeat length, but no 
      significant effect of parental sex on repeat length or age of onset in offspring. 
      DNA analysis for the MJD/SCA3 mutation is useful for diagnosis in patients with 
      familial ataxic or extrapyramidal syndromes, and will aid genetic counselling in 
      these disorders.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia, type 3 (SCA3) is genetically identical to Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD).
PG  - 71-5
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia, type 3 (SCA3) and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) are two 
      clinically distinct representatives of the heterogeneous group of autosomal 
      dominant cerebellar ataxias. Assignment of the disease genes to the same region 
      of the long arm of chromosome 14 in both SCA3 and MJD suggested that these two 
      disorders are genetically identical. The recent identification of a trinucleotide 
      (CAG) repeat expansion in a gene underlying MJD facilitates assessment of this 
      hypothesis. We analysed the MJD gene in members of a family with characteristic 
      features of SCA3 and no symptoms typical of MJD. We found the same trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion within the gene that was previously described in patients with 
      MJD. The findings demonstrate that SCA3 and MJD are genetically identical in 
      spite of their pronounced clinical differences. Furthermore, we demonstrate a 
      striking variation in the copy number of the CAG repeat among affected members of 
      the same family.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 and Machado-Joseph disease: incidence of CAG 
      expansions among adult-onset ataxia patients from 311 families with dominant, 
      recessive, or sporadic ataxia.
PG  - 603-8
AB  - The ataxias are a complex group of diseases with both environmental and genetic 
      causes. Among the autosomal dominant forms of ataxia the genes for two, 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), have been 
      isolated. In both of these disorders the molecular basis of disease is the 
      expansion of an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat. To assess the frequency of the 
      SCA1 and MJD trinucleotide repeat expansions among individuals diagnosed with 
      ataxia we have collected DNA from individuals representing 311 families with 
      adult-onset ataxia of unknown etiology and screened these samples for 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions within the SCA1 and MJD genes. Within this group 
      there are 149 families with dominantly inherited ataxia. Of these, 3% had SCA1 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions, whereas 21% were positive for the MJD 
      trinucleotide expansion. Thus, together SCA1 and MJD represent 24% of the 
      autosomal dominant ataxias in our group, and the frequency of MJD is 
      substantially greater than that of SCA1. For the 57 patients with MJD 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions, a strong inverse correlation between CAG repeat 
      size and age at onset was observed (r = -.838). Among the MJD patients, the 
      normal and affected ranges of CAG repeat size are 14-40 and 68-82 repeats, 
      respectively. For SCA1 the normal and affected ranges are much closer, containing 
      19-38 and 40-81 CAG repeats, respectively.

TI  - Familial periodic cerebellar ataxia without myokymia maps to a 19-cM region on 
      19p13.
PG  - 1443-9
AB  - Familial periodic cerebellar ataxia (FPCA) is a heterogeneous group of rare 
      autosomal dominant disorders characterized by episodic cerebellar disturbance. A 
      potassium-channel gene (KCNA1) has been found to be responsible for one of its 
      subgroups, familial periodic cerebellar ataxia with myokymia (FPCA/+M; MIM 
      160120). A different subgroup that is not associated with myokymia (FPCA/-M; MIM 
      108500) was recently mapped to chromosome 19p. Here we have performed linkage 
      analysis in two large families with FPCA/-M that also demonstrated 
      neurodegenerative pathology of the cerebellum. Three markers in 19p13 gave 
      significant lod scores (> 3.0), while linkage to KCNA1 and three known loci for 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3) was excluded. The highest lod score 
      was obtained with the marker D19S413 (4.4 at recombination fraction 0), and 
      identification of meiotic recombinants in affected individuals placed the locus 
      between the flanking markers D19S406 and D19S226, narrowing the interval to 19 
      cM. A CAG trinucleotide-repeat expansion was detected in one family but did not 
      cosegregate with the disease.
