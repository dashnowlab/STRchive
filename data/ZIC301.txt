TI  - Description of a family with X-linked oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum 
      associated with polyalanine tract expansion in ZIC3.

AB  - Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS) [MIM:164210], or Goldenhar syndrome, is 
      a developmental disorder associating defects of structures derived from the first 
      and second branchial arches. The genetic origin of OAVS is supported by the 
      description of rare deleterious variants in a few causative genes, and several 
      chromosomal copy number variations. We describe here a large family with eight 
      male members affected by a mild form of the spectrum, mostly auricular defects, 
      harboring a hemizygous ZIC3 variant detected by familial exome sequencing: 
      c.159_161dup p.(Ala55dup), resulting in an expansion of the normal 10 consecutive 
      alanine residues to 11 alanines. Segregation analysis shows its presence in all 
      the affected individuals, with a recessive X-linked transmission. Whole-genome 
      sequencing performed in another affected male allowed to exclude linkage 
      disequilibrium between this ZIC3 variant and another potential pathogenic variant 
      in this family. Furthermore, by screening of a cohort of 274 OAVS patients, we 
      found 1 male patient carrying an expansion of 10 to 12 alanines, a variant 
      previously reported in patient presenting with VACTERL. Loss-of-function variants 
      of ZIC3 are causing heterotaxy or cardiac malformations. These alanine expansion 
      variants could have a different impact on the protein and thereby resulting in a 
      different phenotype within the OAVS/VACTERL.
