AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hereditary ataxias (HAs) encompass a diverse and genetically 
      intricate group of rare neurodegenerative disorders, presenting diagnostic 
      challenges. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has significantly improved diagnostic 
      success. This study aimed to elucidate genetic causes of cerebellar ataxia within 
      a diverse Brazilian cohort. METHODS: Biological samples were collected from 
      individuals with sporadic or familial cerebellar ataxia, spanning various ages 
      and phenotypes, excluding common SCAs and Friedreich ataxia. RFC1 biallelic AAGGG 
      repeat expansion was screened in all patients. For AAGGG-negative cases, WES 
      targeting 441 ataxia-related genes was performed, followed by ExpansionHunter 
      analysis for repeat expansions, including the recently described GGC-ZFHX3. 
      Variant classification adhered to ClinGen guidelines, yielding definitive or 
      probable diagnoses. RESULTS: The study involved 76 diverse Brazilian families. 
      16 % received definitive diagnoses, and another 16 % received probable ones. 
      RFC1-related ataxia was predominant, with two definitive cases, followed by KIF1A 
      (one definitive and one probable) and SYNE-1 (two probable). Early-onset cases 
      exhibited higher diagnostic rates. ExpansionHunter improved diagnosis by 4 %.We 
      did not detected GGC-ZFHX3 repeat expansion in this cohort. CONCLUSION: This 
      study highlights diagnostic complexities in cerebellar ataxia, even with advanced 
      genetic methods. RFC1, KIF1A, and SYNE1 emerged as prevalent mutations. ZFHX3 
      repeat expansion seem to be rare in Brazilian population. Early-onset cases 
      showed higher diagnostic success. WES coupled with ExpansionHunter holds promise 
      as a primary diagnostic tool, emphasizing the need for broader NGS accessibility 
      in Brazil.

AB  - Autosomal-dominant ataxia with sensory and autonomic neuropathy is a highly 
      specific combined phenotype that we described in two Swedish kindreds in 2014; 
      its genetic cause had remained unknown. Here, we report the discovery of exonic 
      GGC trinucleotide repeat expansions, encoding poly-glycine, in zinc finger 
      homeobox 3 (ZFHX3) in these families. The expansions were identified in 
      whole-genome datasets within genomic segments that all affected family members 
      shared. Non-expanded alleles carried one or more interruptions within the repeat. 
      We also found ZFHX3 repeat expansions in three additional families, all from the 
      region of Skane in southern Sweden. Individuals with expanded repeats developed 
      balance and gait disturbances at 15 to 60 years of age and had sensory neuropathy 
      and slow saccades. Anticipation was observed in all families and correlated with 
      different repeat lengths determined through long-read sequencing in two family 
      members. The most severely affected individuals had marked autonomic dysfunction, 
      with severe orthostatism as the most disabling clinical feature. Neuropathology 
      revealed p62-positive intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions in neurons of 
      the central and enteric nervous system, as well as alpha-synuclein positivity. 
      ZFHX3 is located within the 16q22 locus, to which spinocerebellar ataxia type 4 
      (SCA4) repeatedly had been mapped; the clinical phenotype in our families 
      corresponded well with the unique phenotype described in SCA4, and the original 
      SCA4 kindred originated from Sweden. ZFHX3 has known functions in neuronal 
      development and differentiation n both the central and peripheral nervous system. 
      Our findings demonstrate that SCA4 is caused by repeat expansions in ZFHX3.

TI  - The P-selectin gene polymorphism Val168Met: a novel risk marker for the 
      occurrence of primary ventricular fibrillation during acute myocardial 
      infarction.

AB  - The P-Selectin Gene Polymorphism Val168Met. AIMS: Ventricular fibrillation (VF) 
      in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the leading cause of 
      sudden cardiac death (SCD). Family history of SCD is described as risk factor for 
      primary VF during acute AMI. Genetic factors may be associated with primary VF. 
      We examined polymorphisms in genes related to the activation and adhesion of 
      blood platelets in patients with and without VF in the setting of AMI and among 
      healthy controls. METHODS: Two hundred and forty patients with a history of AMI 
      and 475 healthy controls were studied. Seventy-three patients (30%) had primary 
      VF during AMI. By using PCR techniques with sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP), 
      we genotyped 5 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in P-selectin (SELP) 
      (V168M, S290N, N592D, V599L, T715P), 2 SNPs (M62I, S273F) in P-selectin 
      glycoprotein ligand-1 (SELPLG), 5 SNPs in CD40LG (-3459A>G, -122A>C, -123A>C, 
      148T>C, intr4-13T>C), the H558R SNP in SCN5A, and rs2106261 in ZFHX3. In 
      addition, length polymorphisms in SELPLG (36bp-tandem repeat) and CD40LG 
      (CA-repeat) were genotyped by PCR methods. Results were evaluated by 2-sided 
      t-tests, chi-square tests, and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: None of the 
      gene polymorphisms showed significant differences between AMI patients and 
      healthy controls. Among patients with a history of VF, however, the SELP 168M 
      variant showed a significantly higher prevalence (14/73 patients; 19.2%) as 
      compared with patients without VF (13/167 patients; 7.8%; P < 0.01). This 
      association remained significant in a logistic regression analysis after 
      adjustment for age and gender (P = 0.013; odds ratio 2.8; 95% confidence interval 
      1.2-6.3). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of an association of the 
      SELP gene variant 168M with primary VF during acute MI. This variant may be a 
      candidate polymorphism for evaluating the susceptibility for VF in the setting of 
      acute MI.

TI  - Characterization of trinucleotide- and tandem repeat-containing transcripts 
      obtained from human spinal cord cDNA library by high-density filter 
      hybridization.
PG  - 265-73
AB  - In order to identify trinucleotide- and tandem repeat-containing transcripts in 
      human spinal cord, hybridization of a high-density spinal cord cDNA library 
      filter was carried out using a radioactively labeled degenerate oligonucleotide 
      designed to detect different trinucleotide repeats including those known to occur 
      in disease-associated expansions, in a single step. The sequence analysis of the 
      trinucleotide repeat-containing transcripts (TNRTs) revealed 23 known mammalian 
      genes with trinucleotide repeat-containing regions (TNRs), some of which were not 
      previously reported to contain TNRs, and 18 cDNA clones with no or insignificant 
      sequence homology to known genes. Amongst the known genes detected was the 
      fragile X gene (FMR-1) containing (CGG)30. Other genes containing extended TNRs 
      of 9 to 21 repeats were calcium-dependent protease, ATBF1-A, ferritin H chain, 
      and the G protein Gsalpha2. Ten sequences containing perfect TNRs and two 
      sequences containing perfect tandem repeats (derived from 11 TNRTs) were further 
      analyzed for allelic variation using primers flanking the TNR, and five were 
      shown to exhibit two to five alleles per TNR. These transcripts were further 
      investigated for their chromosomal localization where unknown or only partially 
      characterized. The transcripts that were polymorphic in the TNR region were 
      ATBF1-A (a homeodomain protein), clone 390013 on chromosome Xp11, a member of the 
      family of the 14.3.3 protein kinase C regulators, a human translation initiation 
      factor (an isolog of the yeast Suilisol gene 1), and a novel sequence (TR21). 
      Only the first two transcripts showed the presence of rare expanded alleles. 
      Characterization of polymorphic TNRs in novel and even known genes expressed in 
      human spinal cord is likely to help in the identification of new candidates for 
      genes involved in neurodegenerative disorders.
