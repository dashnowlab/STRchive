AB  - Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is a 
      destructive disease affecting wheat crops worldwide. Functional genes can be 
      activated in response to Bgt inoculations. Calcineurin B-like protein (CBL) 
      together with CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK) forms the CBL-CIPK protein 
      complex that participates in Ca(2+) sensor kinase-related signaling pathways 
      responding to abiotic and biotic stresses. In this study, we performed a 
      genome-wide screening and identified 27 CIPK subfamilies (123 CIPK transcripts, 
      TaCIPKs) including 55 new and 47 updated TaCIPKs in wheat. Phylogenetic analysis 
      revealed that 123 TaCIPKs could be divided into four groups. Segmental 
      duplications and tandem repeats promoted the expansion of the TaCIPK family. Gene 
      function was further evidenced by differences in gene structure, cis-elements, 
      and protein domains. TaCIPK15-4A was cloned in this study. TaCIPK15-4A contained 
      17 serine, seven tyrosine, and 15 threonine phosphorylation sites and localized 
      in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. TaCIPK15-4A expression was induced after 
      Bgt inoculation. Virus-induced gene silencing and overexpression experiments 
      indicated that TaCIPK15-4A could play a positive role in wheat disease resistance 
      to Bgt. Overall, these results provide insights into the role of the TaCIPK gene 
      family in wheat resistance and could be beneficial for further research to 
      prevent Bgt infection.

AB  - The modulation of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) by small molecules 
      represents a valuable strategy for pharmacological intervention in several human 
      diseases. In this context, computer-aided drug discovery techniques offer useful 
      resources to predict the network of interactions governing the recognition 
      process between protein partners, thus furnishing relevant information for the 
      design of novel PPI modulators. In this work, we focused our attention on the 
      MUC1-CIN85 complex as a crucial PPI controlling cancer progression and 
      metastasis. MUC1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein whose extracellular domain 
      contains a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) regions that are highly 
      glycosylated in normal cells and under-glycosylated in cancer. The 
      hypo-glycosylation fosters the exposure of the backbone to new interactions with 
      other proteins, such as CIN85, that alter the intracellular signalling in tumour 
      cells. Herein, different computational approaches were combined to investigate 
      the molecular recognition pattern of MUC1-CIN85 PPI thus unveiling new structural 
      information useful for the design of MUC1-CIN85 PPI inhibitors as potential 
      anti-metastatic agents.

TI  - A high occurrence of acquisition and/or expansion of C-CBL mutant clones in the 
      progression of high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome to acute myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 1035-42
AB  - The molecular pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and its progression 
      to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) remain to be explored. Somatic C-CBL 
      mutations were recently described in MDS. Our study aimed to determine the role 
      of C-CBL mutations in the progression of MDS to sAML and sought to correlate with 
      clinicohematological features and outcome. Bone marrow samples from 51 patients 
      with high-risk MDS (13 with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, 19 
      with refractory anemia with excess blast 1, and 19 with refractory anemia with 
      excess blast 2) were analyzed for C-CBL mutations at both diagnosis and sAML in 
      the same individuals. Mutational analysis was performed for exons 7 to 9 of C-CBL 
      gene. Of the 51 paired samples, C-CBL mutations were identified in 6 patients at 
      the sAML phase. One patient retained the identical C-CBL mutation (G415S) at sAML 
      evolution and exhibited clonal expansion. The other five patients acquired C-CBL 
      mutations (Y371S, F418S, L370_Y371 ins L, L399V, and C416W) during sAML 
      evolution. Three of the six patients harboring C-CBL mutations at sAML had 
      additional gene mutations including JAK2(V617F), PTPN11, or N-RAS. There was no 
      significant difference in clinicohematological features and overall survival with 
      respect to C-CBL mutation status. Our results show that C-CBL mutation is very 
      rare (0.6%) in MDS, but acquisition and/or expansion of C-CBL mutant clones occur 
      in 11.8% of patients during sAML transformation. The findings suggest that C-CBL 
      mutations play a role at least in part in a subset of MDS patients during sAML 
      transformation.

TI  - Expansion of functionally anergic CD21-/low marginal zone-like B cell clones in 
      hepatitis C virus infection-related autoimmunity.
PG  - 6550-63
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1102022 [doi]
AB  - Homeostasis of peripheral B cell subsets is disturbed during chronic hepatitis C 
      virus (HCV) infection, leading to the occurrence of autoimmunity and B cell 
      lymphoproliferation. However, mechanisms by which HCV causes lymphoproliferation 
      remain controversial. We report in this article on the elevated number of clonal 
      CD21(-/low)IgM(+)CD27(+) marginal zone (MZ)-like B cells, which correlates with 
      autoimmunity and lymphoproliferation in HCV patients. We found an increase in 
      autoreactive BCRs using V(H)1-69 and V(H)4-34 genes in CD21(-/low) MZ B cells. 
      CD21(-/low) MZ B cells showed impaired calcium-mediated signaling, did not 
      upregulate activation markers, and did not proliferate in response to BCR 
      triggering. CD21(-/low) MZ B cells also were prone to dying faster than their 
      CD21(+) counterparts, suggesting that these B cells were anergic. CD21(-/low) MZ 
      B cells, in contrast, remained responsive to TLR9 stimulation. Gene array 
      analyses revealed the critical role of Early growth response 2 and Cbl-b in the 
      induction of anergy. Therefore, HCV patients who display high frequencies of 
      unresponsive CD21(-/low) MZ B cells are more susceptible to developing 
      autoimmunity and/or lymphoproliferation. These cells remain in peripheral blood 
      controlled by functional anergy instead of being eliminated, and chronic 
      antigenic stimulation through TLR stimulation may create a favorable environment 
      for breaking tolerance and activating these cells.

TI  - The WD40 repeats of FANCL are required for Fanconi anemia core complex assembly.
PG  - 10896-905
AB  - Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by aplastic 
      anemia, cancer susceptibility, and cellular sensitivity to mitomycin C. Eight of 
      the 11 cloned Fanconi anemia gene products (FANCA, -B, -C, -E, -F, -G, -L, and 
      -M) form a multisubunit nuclear complex (FA core complex) required for 
      monoubiquitination of a downstream FA protein, FANCD2. FANCL, which possesses 
      three WD40 repeats and a plant homeodomain (PHD), is the putative E3 ubiquitin 
      ligase subunit of the FA complex. Here, we demonstrate that the WD40 repeats of 
      FANCL are required for interaction with other subunits of the FA complex. The PHD 
      is dispensable for this interaction, although it is required for FANCD2 
      mono-ubiquitination. The PHD of FANCL also shares sequence similarity to the 
      canonical RING finger of c-CBL, including a conserved tryptophan required for E2 
      binding by c-CBL. Mutation of this tryptophan in the FANCL PHD significantly 
      impairs in vivo mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 and in vitro auto-ubiquitination 
      activity, and partially impairs restoration of mitomycin C resistance. We propose 
      a model in which FANCL, via its WD40 region, binds the FA complex and, via its 
      PHD, recruits an as-yet-unidentified E2 for mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2.

TI  - Association of a chromosome deletion syndrome with a fragile site within the 
      proto-oncogene CBL2.
PG  - 145-9
AB  - The fragile site FRA11B has been localized to the p(CCG)n repeat of the CBL2 
      proto-oncogene. A proportion of Jacobsen (11q-) syndrome patients inherited a 
      chromosome carrying a CBL2 p(CCG)n expansion, which was truncated close to 
      FRA11B. These results have broad implications for the role of p(CCG)n repeat 
      expansion in the aetiology of genetic disease involving chromosome 
      rearrangements.
