AB  - Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is a 
      destructive disease affecting wheat crops worldwide. Functional genes can be 
      activated in response to Bgt inoculations. Calcineurin B-like protein (CBL) 
      together with CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK) forms the CBL-CIPK protein 
      complex that participates in Ca(2+) sensor kinase-related signaling pathways 
      responding to abiotic and biotic stresses. In this study, we performed a 
      genome-wide screening and identified 27 CIPK subfamilies (123 CIPK transcripts, 
      TaCIPKs) including 55 new and 47 updated TaCIPKs in wheat. Phylogenetic analysis 
      revealed that 123 TaCIPKs could be divided into four groups. Segmental 
      duplications and tandem repeats promoted the expansion of the TaCIPK family. Gene 
      function was further evidenced by differences in gene structure, cis-elements, 
      and protein domains. TaCIPK15-4A was cloned in this study. TaCIPK15-4A contained 
      17 serine, seven tyrosine, and 15 threonine phosphorylation sites and localized 
      in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. TaCIPK15-4A expression was induced after 
      Bgt inoculation. Virus-induced gene silencing and overexpression experiments 
      indicated that TaCIPK15-4A could play a positive role in wheat disease resistance 
      to Bgt. Overall, these results provide insights into the role of the TaCIPK gene 
      family in wheat resistance and could be beneficial for further research to 
      prevent Bgt infection.

TI  - Exploring Molecular Contacts of MUC1 at CIN85 Binding Interface to Address Future 
      Drug Design Efforts.

AB  - The modulation of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) by small molecules 
      represents a valuable strategy for pharmacological intervention in several human 
      diseases. In this context, computer-aided drug discovery techniques offer useful 
      resources to predict the network of interactions governing the recognition 
      process between protein partners, thus furnishing relevant information for the 
      design of novel PPI modulators. In this work, we focused our attention on the 
      MUC1-CIN85 complex as a crucial PPI controlling cancer progression and 
      metastasis. MUC1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein whose extracellular domain 
      contains a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) regions that are highly 
      glycosylated in normal cells and under-glycosylated in cancer. The 
      hypo-glycosylation fosters the exposure of the backbone to new interactions with 
      other proteins, such as CIN85, that alter the intracellular signalling in tumour 
      cells. Herein, different computational approaches were combined to investigate 
      the molecular recognition pattern of MUC1-CIN85 PPI thus unveiling new structural 
      information useful for the design of MUC1-CIN85 PPI inhibitors as potential 
      anti-metastatic agents.

TI  - Association of a chromosome deletion syndrome with a fragile site within the 
      proto-oncogene CBL2.
PG  - 145-9
AB  - The fragile site FRA11B has been localized to the p(CCG)n repeat of the CBL2 
      proto-oncogene. A proportion of Jacobsen (11q-) syndrome patients inherited a 
      chromosome carrying a CBL2 p(CCG)n expansion, which was truncated close to 
      FRA11B. These results have broad implications for the role of p(CCG)n repeat 
      expansion in the aetiology of genetic disease involving chromosome 
      rearrangements.
