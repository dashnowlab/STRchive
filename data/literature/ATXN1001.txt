AB  - There is an obvious clinical-pathological overlap between essential tremor and 
      some known tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansion disorders. The aim is 
      to analyse whether these short tandem repeat genes, including ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, TBP, BEAN1, NOP56, DAB1, ATN1, 
      SADM12 and FMR1, are associated with familial essential tremor patients. Genetic 
      analysis of repeat sizes in tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansions was 
      performed in a large cohort of 515 familial essential tremor probands and 300 
      controls. The demographic and clinical features among carriers of pathogenic 
      expansions, intermediate repeats and non-carriers were compared. A total of 18 
      out of 515 (18/515, 3.7%) patients were found to have repeats expansions, 
      including 12 cases (12/515, 2.5%) with intermediate repeat expansions (one ATXN1, 
      eight TBP, two FMR1, one ATN1), and six cases (6/515, 1.2%) with pathogenic 
      expansions (one ATXN1, one ATXN2, one ATXN8OS, one PPP2R2B, one FMR1, one 
      SAMD12). There were no statistically significant differences in intermediate 
      repeats compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, there were no significant 
      differences in demographics and clinical features among individuals with 
      pathogenic expansions, intermediate repeat expansions carriers and non-carriers. 
      Our study indicates that the intermediate repeat expansion in tremor-associated 
      short tandem repeat expansions does not pose an increased risk for essential 
      tremor, and rare pathogenic expansion carriers have been found in the familial 
      essential tremor cohort. The diagnosis of essential tremor based solely on 
      clinical symptoms remains a challenge in distinguishing it from known short 
      tandem repeat expansions diseases with overlapping clinical-pathological 
      features.

TI  - Extended haplotype with rs41524547-G defines the ancestral origin of SCA10.
PG  - 1567-1574
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddae092 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a rare autosomal dominant ataxia caused 
      by a large expansion of the (ATTCT)n repeat in ATXN10. SCA10 was described in 
      Native American and Asian individuals which prompted a search for an expanded 
      haplotype to confirm a common ancestral origin for the expansion event. All 
      patients with SCA10 expansions in our cohort share a single haplotype defined at 
      the 5'-end by the minor allele of rs41524547, located ~35 kb upstream of the 
      SCA10 expansion. Intriguingly, rs41524547 is located within the miRNA gene, 
      MIR4762, within its DROSHA cleavage site and just outside the seed sequence for 
      mir4792-5p. The world-wide frequency of rs41524547-G is less than 5% and found 
      almost exclusively in the Americas and East Asia-a geographic distribution that 
      mirrors reported SCA10 cases. We identified rs41524547-G(+) DNA from the 1000 
      Genomes/International Genome Sample Resource and our own general population 
      samples and identified SCA10 repeat expansions in up to 25% of these samples. The 
      reduced penetrance of these SCA10 expansions may be explained by a young 
      (pre-onset) age at sample collection, a small repeat size, purity of repeat 
      units, or the disruption of miR4762-5p function. We conclude that rs41524547-G is 
      the most robust at-risk SNP allele for SCA10, is useful for screening of SCA10 
      expansions in population genetics studies and provides the most compelling 
      evidence to date for a single, prehistoric origin of SCA10 expansions sometime 
      prior to or during the migration of individuals across the Bering Land Bridge 
      into the Americas.

      spinocerebellar ataxia type 10.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal-dominant disorder caused 
      by an expanded pentanucleotide repeat in the ATXN10 gene. This repeat expansion, 
      when fully penetrant, has a size of 850-4,500 repeats. It has been shown that the 
      repeat composition can be a modifier of disease, e.g., seizures. Here, we 
      describe a Mexican kindred in which we identified both pure (ATTCT)(n) and mixed 
      (ATTCT)(n)-(ATTCC)(n) expansions in the same family. We used amplification-free 
      targeted sequencing and optical genome mapping to decipher the composition of 
      these repeat expansions. We found a considerable degree of mosaicism of the 
      repeat expansion. This mosaicism was confirmed in skin fibroblasts from 
      individuals with ATXN10 expansions with RNAScope in situ hybridization. All 
      affected family members with the mixed ATXN10 repeat expansion showed typical 
      clinical signs of spinocerebellar ataxia and epilepsy. In contrast, individuals 
      with the pure ATXN10 expansion present with Parkinson's disease or are 
      unaffected, even in individuals more than 20 years older than the average age at 
      onset for SCA10. Our findings suggest that the pure (ATTCT)(n) expansion is 
      non-pathogenic, while repeat interruptions, e.g., (ATTCC)(n), are necessary to 
      cause SCA10. This mechanism has been recently described for several other repeat 
      expansions including SCA31 (BEAN1), SCA37 (DAB1), and three loci for benign adult 
      familial myoclonic epilepsy BAFME (SAMD12, TNRC6A, RAPGEF2). Therefore, long-read 
      sequencing and optical genome mapping of the entire genomic structure of repeat 
      expansions are critical for clinical practice and genetic counseling, as 
      variations in the repeat can affect disease penetrance, symptoms, and disease 
      trajectory.

TI  - A FEMALE CASE OF SPINOCEREBELLAR ATAXIA TYPE 10 WITH SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR AND 
      ENDOCRINPATHIES ASSOCIATED WITH A MASSIVE EXPANSION (ATTCT) OF THE GENE ATXN10.
PG  - 58-62
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is characteri- zed by ataxia, psychiatric 
      disorders convulsions, and locus at 22q13.311. It is caused by expansions between 
      800-4500 pentanucleotide ATTCT repeats in intron 9 of the ATXN10 gene1-2. The 
      ATXN10 gene encodes ataxin-10 protein (known as E46L) involved in neuritogenesis 
      1. SCA10 has a founder origin in Mexican, Brazilian, Argentine populattons but is 
      rare in others.

AB  - Atxn10 is a gene known for its role in cytokinesis and is associated with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA10), a slowly progressing cerebellar syndrome caused 
      by an intragenic pentanucleotide repeat expansion. Atxn10 is also implicated in 
      the ciliopathy syndromes nephronophthisis (NPHP) and Joubert syndrome (JBTS), 
      which are caused by the disruption of cilia function leading to nephron loss, 
      impaired renal function, and cerebellar hypoplasia. How Atxn10 disruption 
      contributes to these disorders remains unknown. Here, we generated Atxn10 
      congenital and conditional mutant mouse models. Our data indicate that while 
      ATXN10 protein can be detected around the base of the cilium as well as in the 
      cytosol, its loss does not cause overt changes in cilia formation or morphology. 
      Congenital loss of Atxn10 results in embryonic lethality around E10.5 associated 
      with pericardial effusion and loss of trabeculation. Similarly, tissue-specific 
      loss of ATXN10 in the developing endothelium (Tie2-Cre) and myocardium (cTnT-Cre) 
      also results in embryonic lethality with severe cardiac malformations occurring 
      in the latter. Using an inducible Cagg-CreER to disrupt ATXN10 systemically at 
      postnatal stages, we show that ATXN10 is also required for survival in adult 
      mice. Loss of ATXN10 results in severe pancreatic and renal abnormalities leading 
      to lethality within a few weeks post ATXN10 deletion in adult mice. Evaluation of 
      these phenotypes further identified rapid epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition 
      (EMT) in these tissues. In the pancreas, the phenotype includes signs of both 
      acinar to ductal metaplasia and EMT with aberrant cilia formation and severe 
      defects in glucose homeostasis related to pancreatic insufficiency or defects in 
      feeding or nutrient intake. Collectively, this study identifies ATXN10 as an 
      essential protein for survival.

AB  - PURPOSE: Investigate single nucleotide variants and short tandem repeats in 39 
      genes related to spinocerebellar ataxia in clinical and pathologically defined 
      cohorts of multiple system atrophy. METHODS: Exome sequencing was conducted in 28 
      clinical multiple system atrophy patients to identify single nucleotide variants 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes. Novel variants were validated in two 
      independent disease cohorts: 86 clinically diagnosed multiple system atrophy 
      patients and 166 pathological multiple system atrophy cases. Expanded repeat 
      alleles in spinocerebellar ataxia genes were evaluated in 36 clinically diagnosed 
      multiple system atrophy patients, and CAG/CAA repeats in TATA-Box Binding Protein 
      (TBP, causative of SCA17) were screened in 216 clinical and pathological multiple 
      system atrophy patients and 346 controls. RESULTS: No known pathogenic 
      spinocerebellar ataxia single nucleotide variants or pathogenic range expanded 
      repeat alleles of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, AXTN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, 
      and TBP were detected in any clinical multiple system atrophy patients. However, 
      four novel variants were identified in four spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes 
      across three multiple system atrophy patients. Additionally, four multiple system 
      atrophy patients (1.6%) and one control (0.3%) carried an intermediate length 41 
      TBP CAG/CAA repeat allele (OR = 4.11, P = 0.21). There was a significant 
      association between the occurrence of a repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) and an increased risk of multiple system atrophy (OR = 1.64, P = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: Occurrence of TBP CAG/CAA repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) is significantly associated with increased multiple system atrophy risk. 
      This discovery warrants further investigation and supports a possible genetic 
      overlap of multiple system atrophy with SCA17.

TI  - Minidumbbell structures formed by ATTCT pentanucleotide repeats in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 10.
PG  - 7557-7568

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a progressive genetic disorder caused 
      by ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat expansions in intron 9 of the ATXN10 gene. ATTCT 
      repeats have been reported to form unwound secondary structures which are likely 
      linked to large-scale repeat expansions. In this study, we performed 
      high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic investigations on DNA 
      sequences containing two to five ATTCT repeats. Strikingly, we found the first 
      two repeats of all these sequences well folded into highly compact minidumbbell 
      (MDB) structures. The 3D solution structure of the sequence containing two ATTCT 
      repeats was successfully determined, revealing the MDB comprises a regular TTCTA 
      and a quasi TTCT/A pentaloops with extensive stabilizing loop-loop interactions. 
      We further carried out in vitro primer extension assays to examine if the MDB 
      formed in the primer could escape from the proofreading function of DNA 
      polymerase. Results showed that when the MDB was formed at 5-bp or farther away 
      from the priming site, it was able to escape from the proofreading by Klenow 
      fragment of DNA polymerase I and thus retained in the primer. The intriguing 
      structural findings bring about new insights into the origin of genetic 
      instability in SCA10.

AB  - Large expansions of microsatellite DNA cause several neurological diseases. In 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10), the repeat interruptions change disease 
      phenotype; an (ATTCC)n or a (ATCCT)n/(ATCCC)n interruption within the (ATTCT)n 
      repeat is associated with the robust phenotype of ataxia and epilepsy while 
      mostly pure (ATTCT)n may have reduced penetrance. Large repeat expansions of 
      SCA10, and many other microsatellite expansions, can exceed 10,000 base pairs 
      (bp) in size. Conventional next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are 
      ineffective in determining internal sequence contents or size of these expanded 
      repeats. Using repeat primed PCR (RP-PCR) in conjunction with a high-sensitivity 
      pulsed-field capillary electrophoresis fragment analyzer (FEMTO-Pulse, Agilent, 
      Santa Clara, CA) (RP-FEMTO hereafter), we successfully determined sequence 
      content of large expansion repeats in genomic DNA of SCA10 patients and 
      transformed yeast artificial chromosomes containing SCA10 repeats. This RP-FEMTO 
      is a simple and economical methodology which could complement emerging NGS for 
      very long sequence reads such as Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) and nanopore 
      sequencing technologies.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10): Mutation analysis and common haplotype 
      based inference suggest its rarity in Indian population.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a rare autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia caused by nucleotide ATTCT expansion in ATXN10 gene. SCA10 has been 
      reported in patients of cerebellar ataxia from Amerindian/Latin America and in 
      East Asian ancestry. A common founder has been ascribed to the origin of ATTCT 
      repeat expansion mutation in both the population. Here we present our 
      investigation of the SCA10 pentanucleotide repeat expansion in 461 SCA patients 
      of the Indian population. The analysis of multi-ethnic at-risk haplotype 
      C-(ATTCT)n-GGC was performed using genotype data of various ethnic population 
      included in the 1000 Genomes Project (KGP) to infer the prevalence of at-risk 
      haplotype in the Indian populations. Unsurprisingly, none of the patient's DNA 
      samples with (ATTCT)n expansion was observed in pathological range, however, the 
      observed normal range of (ATTCT)n was 8-22 repeats, suggesting very rare or 
      absence of the occurrence of SCA10 in Indian SCA patients. The at-risk haplotype, 
      CGGC was found to be the most prevalent haplotype across different populations 
      and no segregation of CGGC haplotype with large normal or small normal ATTCT 
      repeats length was observed. However, on extended haplotype analysis, some 
      lineage of CGGC with a flanking divergence at 5' end was observed specifically in 
      the American or East Asian population but not in other population in KGP dataset. 
      Together, these evidence points towards the absence of SCA10 in Indian population 
      and haplotype-based analysis also suggests its occurrence to be rare in South 
      Asian, European and African population. Further investigations are required to 
      establish the present finding. SIGNIFICANCE: The implications of the findings of 
      this study are 1.) For the diagnostic work-up of SCAs in the Indian population 
      and to decide upon inclusion of SCA10 in panel based genetic investigations even 
      for Indians living abroad. 2.) The haplotype based inference of its presumptive 
      prevalence through the estimation of at-risk haplotype using population genetics 
      approach (South-Asians as the background) allowed us to estimate the possible 
      absence of SCA10 in Indian population. SCA10 is a rare autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia mostly reported among SCA patients from Latin America and 
      recently described in East Asia population. The genetic study of SCA10 performed 
      in the unrelated Indian spinocerebellar ataxia patients with heterogeneous 
      ethnicity confirmed its absence from the Indian population and that conforms to 
      population genetic based inference of its rarity or absence. 3.) This approach 
      may be adopted for the screening of other subtypes of SCAs, i.e. other rare SCAs 
      e.g. SCA31, SCA36, and SCA37.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a hereditary 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by repeat expansions in the ATXN10 gene. 
      Patients present with cerebellar ataxia frequently accompanied by seizures. Even 
      though loss of cerebellar Purkinje neurons has been described, its brain 
      degeneration pattern is unknown. Our aim was to characterize the gray and white 
      matter degeneration patterns in SCA10 patients and the association with clinical 
      features. METHODS: We enrolled 18 patients with molecular diagnosis of SCA10 and 
      18 healthy individuals matched for age and sex. All participants underwent brain 
      MRI including high-resolution anatomical and diffusion images. Whole-brain 
      Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) and Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) were 
      performed to identify white and grey matter degeneration respectively. A second 
      analysis in the cerebellum identified the unbiased pattern of degeneration. Motor 
      impairment was assessed using the SARA Scale. RESULTS: TBSS analysis in the 
      patient group revealed white matter atrophy exclusively in the cerebellum. VBM 
      analysis showed extensive grey matter degeneration in the cerebellum, brainstem, 
      thalamus, and putamen. Significant associations between cerebellar degeneration 
      and SARA scores were found. Additionally, degeneration in thalamic GM and WM in 
      the cerebellar lobule VI were significantly associated with the presence of 
      seizures. CONCLUSION: The results show that besides cerebellum and brainstem, 
      brain degeneration in SCA10 includes predominantly the putamen and thalamus; 
      involvement of the latter is strongly associated with seizures. Analysis of the 
      unbiased degeneration pattern in the cerebellum suggests lobules VIIIb, IX, and X 
      as the primary cerebellar targets of the disease, which expands to the anterior 
      lobe in later stages.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a repeat expansion disease occurring 
      mostly in Latin America, suggesting that the mutation spread with the peopling of 
      the Americas, or that Amerindian populations, have a higher ATXN10 mutability. 
      High frequency of large normal alleles is associated with prevalence and relative 
      frequency of other repeat expansion diseases. To test whether the allele 
      distribution of the SCA10-causing ATXN10 microsatellite in an Amerindian Peruvian 
      population differs from that of other populations. The ATXN10 allele distribution 
      in a Quechua Peruvian population from Puno, Peru, is similar to that of Finland. 
      Mean allele size and mode were also similar to those of Mexico, Japan, and white 
      Europeans. ATXN10 allele distribution in a healthy Amerindian population from 
      Peru does not differ from that of other populations.

TI  - Olfactory Function in SCA10.
PG  - 85-90
LID - 10.1007/s12311-018-0954-1 [doi]
AB  - Although the main clinical manifestations of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) 
      result from damage of the cerebellum, other systems may also be involved. 
      Olfactory deficits have been reported in other types of ataxias, especially in 
      SCA3; however, there are no studies on olfactory deficits in SCA type 10 (SCA10). 
      To analyze olfactory function of SCA10 patients compared with that of SCA3, 
      Parkinson's, and healthy controls. Olfactory identification was tested in three 
      groups of 30 patients (SCA10, SCA3, and Parkinson's disease (PD)) and 44 healthy 
      controls using the Sniffin' Sticks (SS16) test. Mean SS16 score was 11.9 +/- 2.9 
      for the SCA10 group, 12.3 +/- 1.9 for the SCA3 group, 6.6 +/- 2.8 for the PD group, 
      and 12.1 +/- 2.0 for the control group. Mean SS16 score for the SCA10 group was not 
      significantly different from the scores for the SCA3 and control groups but was 
      significantly higher than the score for the PD group (p < 0.001) when adjusted 
      for age, gender, and history of smoking. There was no association between SS16 
      scores and disease duration in the SCA10 or SCA3 groups or number of repeat 
      expansions. SS16 and Mini Mental State Examination scores were correlated in the 
      three groups: SCA10 group (r = 0.59, p = 0.001), SCA3 group (r = 0.50, 
      p = 0.005), and control group (r = 0.40, p = 0.007). We found no significant 
      olfactory deficits in SCA10 in this large series.

      SCA patients negative for the most common SCA subtypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) subtypes are often caused by expansions 
      in non-coding regions of genes like SCA8, SCA10, SCA12 and SCA36. Other ataxias 
      are known to be associated with repeat expansions such as fragile X-associated 
      tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) or expansions in the C9orf72 gene. When no 
      mutation has been identified in the aforementioned genes next-generation 
      sequencing (NGS)-based diagnostics may also be applied. In order to define an 
      optimal diagnostic strategy, more information about the frequency and phenotypic 
      characteristics of rare repeat expansion disorders associated with ataxia should 
      be at hand. METHODS: We analyzed a consecutive cohort of 440 German unrelated 
      patients with symptoms of cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria and other unspecific 
      symptoms who were referred to our center for SCA diagnostics. They showed alleles 
      in the normal range for the most common SCA subtypes SCA1-3, SCA6, SCA7 and 
      SCA17. These patients were screened for expansions causing SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA36 and FXTAS as well as for the pathogenic hexanucleotide repeat in the 
      C9orf72 gene. RESULTS: Expanded repeats for SCA10, SCA12 or SCA36 were not 
      identified in the analyzed patients. Five patients showed expanded SCA8 CTA/CTG 
      alleles with 92-129 repeats. One 51-year-old male with unclear dementia symptoms 
      was diagnosed with a large GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72. The analysis of 
      the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) revealed one patient with a 
      premutation (>50 CGG repeats) and seven patients with alleles in the grey zone 
      (41 to 54 CGG repeats). CONCLUSIONS: Altogether five patients showed 92 or more 
      SCA8 CTA/CTG combined repeats. Our results support the assumption that smaller 
      FMR1 gene expansions could be associated with the risk of developing neurological 
      signs. The results do not support genetic testing for C9orf72 expansion in ataxia 
      patients.

AB  - Large, non-coding pentanucleotide repeat expansions of ATTCT in intron 9 of the 
      ATXN10 gene typically cause progressive spinocerebellar ataxia with or without 
      seizures and present neuropathologically with Purkinje cell loss resulting in 
      symmetrical cerebellar atrophy. These ATXN10 repeat expansions can be interrupted 
      by sequence motifs which have been attributed to seizures and are likely to act 
      as genetic modifiers. We identified a Mexican kindred with multiple affected 
      family members with ATXN10 expansions. Four affected family members showed 
      clinical features of spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10). However, one 
      affected individual presented with early-onset levodopa-responsive parkinsonism, 
      and one family member carried a large repeat ATXN10 expansion, but was clinically 
      unaffected. To characterize the ATXN10 repeat, we used a novel technology of 
      single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing and CRISPR/Cas9-based capture. We 
      sequenced the entire span of ~5.3-7.0 kb repeat expansions. The Parkinson's 
      patient carried an ATXN10 expansion with no repeat interruption motifs as well as 
      an unaffected sister. In the siblings with typical SCA10, we found a repeat 
      pattern of ATTCC repeat motifs that have not been associated with seizures 
      previously. Our data suggest that the absence of repeat interruptions is likely a 
      genetic modifier for the clinical presentation of l-Dopa responsive parkinsonism, 
      whereas repeat interruption motifs contribute clinically to epilepsy. Repeat 
      interruptions are important genetic modifiers of the clinical phenotype in SCA10. 
      Advanced sequencing techniques now allow to better characterize the underlying 
      genetic architecture for determining accurate phenotype-genotype correlations.

LID - e0175958
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10), an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia 
      disorder, is caused by a non-coding ATTCT microsatellite repeat expansion in the 
      ataxin 10 gene. In a subset of SCA10 families, the 5'-end of the repeat expansion 
      contains a complex sequence of penta- and heptanucleotide interruption motifs 
      which is followed by a pure tract of tandem ATCCT repeats of unknown length at 
      its 3'-end. Intriguingly, expansions that carry these interruption motifs 
      correlate with an epileptic seizure phenotype and are unstable despite the theory 
      that interruptions are expected to stabilize expanded repeats. To examine the 
      apparent contradiction of unstable, interruption-positive SCA10 expansion alleles 
      and to determine whether the instability originates outside of the interrupted 
      region, we sequenced approximately 1 kb of the 5'-end of SCA10 expansions using 
      the ATCCT-PCR product in individuals across multiple generations from four SCA10 
      families. We found that the greatest instability within this region occurred in 
      paternal transmissions of the allele in stretches of pure ATTCT motifs while the 
      intervening interrupted sequences were stable. Overall, the ATCCT interruption 
      changes by only one to three repeat units and therefore cannot account for the 
      instability across the length of the disease allele. We conclude that the AT-rich 
      interruptions locally stabilize the SCA10 expansion at the 5'-end but do not 
      completely abolish instability across the entire span of the expansion. In 
      addition, analysis of the interruption alleles across these families support a 
      parsimonious single origin of the mutation with a shared distant ancestor.

AB  - RNA is an important target for chemical probes of function and lead therapeutics; 
      however, it is difficult to target with small molecules. One approach to tackle 
      this problem is to identify compounds that target RNA structures and utilize them 
      to multivalently target RNA. Here we show that small molecules can be identified 
      to selectively bind RNA base pairs by probing a library of RNA-focused small 
      molecules. A small molecule that selectively binds AU base pairs informed design 
      of a dimeric compound (2AU-2) that targets the pathogenic RNA, expanded r(AUUCU) 
      repeats, that causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) in patient-derived 
      cells. Indeed, 2AU-2 (50 nM) ameliorates various aspects of SCA10 pathology 
      including improvement of mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced activation of caspase 
      3, and reduction of nuclear foci. These studies provide a first-in-class chemical 
      probe to study SCA10 RNA toxicity and potentially define broadly applicable 
      compounds targeting RNA AU base pairs in cells.

TI  - Analysis of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, SCA17 and SCA19 in patients with unknown 
      spinocerebellar ataxia: a Thai multicentre study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: About 50 % of Thai patients with adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) was Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6. The author 
      investigated further on less common SCAs in the patients without any known 
      mutations. METHODS: DNA samples of 82 index patients who were genetically 
      excluded MJD, SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) were examined. Analysis of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, SCA17 and SCA19 genes were 
      comprehensively performed. Normal range of trinucleotide repeat expansion sizes 
      of TATA-box-binding protein gene (TBP) were also determined in 374 control 
      subjects. RESULTS: Eight patients carried >/=42 CAG/CAA repeat allele in the TBP 
      consistent with SCA17. The pathological repeat alleles ranged from 42 to 57 
      repeats. All patients had significant degree of cognitive dysfunction. Other 
      non-ataxic phenotypes comprised of parkinsonism, chorea, dystonia and myoclonus. 
      A sporadic patient carried a heterozygous 41-repeat allele developed chronic 
      progressive cerebellar degeneration commenced at the age of 28 years. Whilst, 2 % 
      of the control subjects (8/374) carried the 41-repeat allele. Five of the 
      carriers were re-examined, and revealed that four of them had parkinsonism and/or 
      cognitive impairment without cerebellar signs. Analysis of other types of SCAs 
      was all negative. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA17 and SCA19 in Thais. SCA17 appears to be an important cause of ataxia in 
      Thailand. Although, the pathological cut-off point of the TBP repeat allele 
      remains unclear, the finding suggests that the 41-repeat may be a pathological 
      allele resulting late-onset or mild phenotype. Apart from ataxia, cognitive 
      impairment and parkinsonism may be clinical presentations in these carriers.

AB  - A large, non-coding ATTCT repeat expansion causes the neurodegenerative disorder, 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10). In a subset of SCA10 patients, 
      interruption motifs are present at the 5' end of the expansion and strongly 
      correlate with epileptic seizures. Thus, interruption motifs are a predictor of 
      the epileptic phenotype and are hypothesized to act as a phenotypic modifier in 
      SCA10. Yet, the exact internal sequence structure of SCA10 expansions remains 
      unknown due to limitations in current technologies for sequencing across long 
      extended tracts of tandem nucleotide repeats. We used the third generation 
      sequencing technology, Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing, to obtain 
      full-length contiguous expansion sequences, ranging from 2.5 to 4.4 kb in length, 
      from three SCA10 patients with different clinical presentations. We obtained 
      sequence spanning the entire length of the expansion and identified the structure 
      of known and novel interruption motifs within the SCA10 expansion. The exact 
      interruption patterns in expanded SCA10 alleles will allow us to further 
      investigate the potential contributions of these interrupting sequences to the 
      pathogenic modification leading to the epilepsy phenotype in SCA10. Our results 
      also demonstrate that SMRT sequencing is useful for deciphering long tandem 
      repeats that pose as "gaps" in the human genome sequence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association of repeat expansion size in 10 common 
      degenerative hereditary ataxia genes with essential tremor. These genes were 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 
      (CACNA1A), SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), 
      SCA-17 (TBP) and dentatorubral-pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA) (ATN1). METHODS: 
      Genetic analysis of repeat size in 10 degenerative hereditary ataxia loci was 
      performed in 323 essential tremor patients and 299 controls enrolled at Columbia 
      University. To test for differences in the allele distribution between patients 
      and controls, a CLUMP analysis was performed. RESULTS: None of the essential 
      tremor patients had a repeat expansion in the intermediate or pathogenic range. 
      Significant differences in the distribution of repeats in the 'normal' range for 
      SCA2 and SCA8 (both p </= 0.02) were observed between essential tremor patients and 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      SCA loci are not associated with essential tremor.

TI  - Crystallographic and Computational Analyses of AUUCU Repeating RNA That Causes 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 10 (SCA10).
PG  - 3851-9
LID - 10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00551 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is caused by a pentanucleotide repeat 
      expansion of r(AUUCU) within intron 9 of the ATXN10 pre-mRNA. The RNA causes 
      disease by a gain-of-function mechanism in which it inactivates proteins involved 
      in RNA biogenesis. Spectroscopic studies showed that r(AUUCU) repeats form a 
      hairpin structure; however, there were no high-resolution structural models prior 
      to this work. Herein, we report the first crystal structure of model r(AUUCU) 
      repeats refined to 2.8 A and analysis of the structure via molecular dynamics 
      simulations. The r(AUUCU) tracts adopt an overall A-form geometry in which 3 x 3 
      nucleotide (5')UCU(3')/(3')UCU(5') internal loops are closed by AU pairs. Helical 
      parameters of the refined structure as well as the corresponding electron density 
      map on the crystallographic model reflect dynamic features of the internal loop. 
      The computational analyses captured dynamic motion of the loop closing pairs, 
      which can form single-stranded conformations with relatively low energies. 
      Overall, the results presented here suggest the possibility for r(AUUCU) repeats 
      to form metastable A-from structures, which can rearrange into single-stranded 
      conformations and attract proteins such as heterogeneous nuclear 
      ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K). The information presented here may aid in the 
      rational design of therapeutics targeting this RNA.

AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that are related 
      to at least 36 different genetic loci; they are clinically characterized by 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia and are frequently accompanied by other 
      neurological and non-neurological manifestations. The relative frequency of SCA 
      varies greatly among different regions, presumably because of a founder effect or 
      local ethnicities. Between July 1998 and May 2012, we investigated 320 Brazilian 
      patients with an SCA phenotype who belonged to 150 unrelated families with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and 23 sporadic patients from 13 Brazilian 
      states. A total of 265 patients (82.8%) belonging to 131 unrelated families 
      (87.3%) were found to have a definite mutation, and SCA3 accounted for most of 
      the familial cases (70.7%), followed by SCA7 (6%), SCA1 (5.3%), SCA2 (2.7%), SCA6 
      (1.3%), SCA8 (0.7%) and SCA10 (0.7%). In the Ribeirao Preto mesoregion, which is 
      located in the northeast part of Sao Paulo State, the prevalence of SCA3 was 
      approximately 5 per 100,000 inhabitants, which is the highest prevalence found in 
      Brazil. No mutation was found in the SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA genes, and all the 
      sporadic cases remained without a molecular diagnosis. This study further 
      characterizes the spectrum of SCA mutations found in Brazilian patients, which 
      suggests the existence of regional differences and demonstrates the expansion of 
      the SCA8 locus in Brazilian families.

TI  - Repeat interruptions in spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 expansions are strongly 
      associated with epileptic seizures.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10), an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder, is the result of a non-coding, pentanucleotide repeat expansion within 
      intron 9 of the Ataxin 10 gene. SCA10 patients present with pure cerebellar 
      ataxia; yet, some families also have a high incidence of epilepsy. SCA10 
      expansions containing penta- and heptanucleotide interruption motifs, termed 
      "ATCCT interruptions," experience large contractions during germline 
      transmission, particularly in paternal lineages. At the same time, these alleles 
      confer an earlier age at onset which contradicts traditional rules of genetic 
      anticipation in repeat expansions. Previously, ATCCT interruptions have been 
      associated with a higher prevalence of epileptic seizures in one Mexican-American 
      SCA10 family. In a large cohort of SCA10 families, we analyzed whether ATCCT 
      interruptions confer a greater risk for developing seizures in these families. 
      Notably, we find that the presence of repeat interruptions within the SCA10 
      expansion confers a 6.3-fold increase in the risk of an SCA10 patient developing 
      epilepsy (6.2-fold when considering patients of Mexican ancestry only) and a 
      13.7-fold increase in having a positive family history of epilepsy (10.5-fold 
      when considering patients of Mexican ancestry only). We conclude that the 
      presence of repeat interruptions in SCA10 repeat expansion indicates a 
      significant risk for the epilepsy phenotype and should be considered during 
      genetic counseling.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10), an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, 
      is caused by the expansion of the non-coding ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat in the 
      ATAXIN 10 gene. To date, all cases of SCA10 are restricted to patients with 
      ancestral ties to Latin American countries. Here, we report on a SCA10 patient 
      with Sioux Native American ancestry and no reported Hispanic or Latino heritage. 
      Neurological exam findings revealed impaired gait with mild, age-consistent 
      cerebellar atrophy and no evidence of epileptic seizures. The age at onset for 
      this patient, at 83 years of age, is the latest documented for SCA10 patients and 
      is suggestive of a reduced penetrance allele in his family. Southern blot 
      analysis showed an SCA10 expanded allele of 1400 repeats. Established SNPs 
      surrounding the SCA10 locus showed a disease haplotype consistent with the 
      previously described "SCA10 haplotype". This case suggests that the SCA10 
      expansion represents an early mutation event that possibly occurred during the 
      initial peopling of the Americas.

AB  - Intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions in ataxin 2 are a risk factor for 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The polyglutamine tract is encoded by a 
      trinucleotide repeat in a coding region of the ataxin 2 gene (ATXN2). Noncoding 
      nucleotide repeat expansions in several genes are also associated with 
      neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. For example, hexanucleotide repeat 
      expansions located in a noncoding region of C9ORF72 are the most common cause of 
      ALS. We sought to assess a potential larger role of noncoding nucleotide repeat 
      expansions in ALS. We analyzed the nucleotide repeat lengths of 6 genes (ATXN8, 
      ATXN10, PPP2R2B, NOP56, DMPK, and JPH3) that have previously been associated with 
      neurologic or neuromuscular disorders, in several hundred sporadic patients with 
      ALS and healthy control subjects. We report no association between ALS and repeat 
      length in any of these genes, suggesting that variation in the noncoding 
      repetitive regions in these genes does not contribute to ALS.

      expansions and repeat instability.

LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2013.32 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a noncoding ATTCT pentanucleotide expansion. An inverse 
      correlation between SCA10 expansion size and age at onset has been reported, and 
      genetic anticipation has been documented. Interruptions in the ATTCT expansion 
      are known to occur within the expansion. In order to determine the effect of 
      repeat interruptions in SCA10 expansions, we designed a PCR assay to easily 
      identify ATCCT repeat interruptions in the 5'-end of the expansion. We screened a 
      cohort of 31 SCA10 families of Mexican, Brazilian and Argentinean ancestry to 
      identify those with ATCCT repeat interruptions within their SCA10 expansions. We 
      then studied the effects of ATCCT interruptions on intergenerational repeat 
      instability, anticipation and age at onset. We find that the SCA10 expansion size 
      is larger in SCA10 patients with an interrupted allele, but there is no 
      difference in the age at onset compared with those expansions without detectable 
      interruptions. An inverse correlation between the expansion size and the age at 
      onset was found only with SCA10 alleles without interruptions. Interrupted 
      expansion alleles show anticipation but are accompanied by a paradoxical 
      contraction in intergenerational repeat size. In conclusion, we find that SCA10 
      expansions with ATCCT interruptions dramatically differ from SCA10 expansions 
      without detectable ATCCT interruptions in repeat-size-instability dynamics and 
      pathogenicity.

AB  - We present a unique thirty-nine year old woman with both Huntington's disease 
      (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10). She has 48 CAG repeats in the HD 
      gene and 2511 ATTCT repeats in the ATX10 gene. Although both conditions are 
      repeat expansion diseases they are thought to have quite different pathogenic 
      mechanisms. The symptomatic age of onset in this patient (mid30s) is within the 
      expected range for her repeat expansion sizes for each condition, but we discuss 
      the evidence that the two conditions may interact to produce a more severe 
      cognitive phenotype than would be expected for either of the conditions 
      independently. The subject has Amerindian background on the maternal side from 
      Colombia, South America, thus adding a 5th country expressing SCA10, all with 
      Amerindian ancestry.

AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) encompass a heterogeneous group of 
      rare diseases that affect the cerebellum and its connections. The most common 
      forms have been associated with dynamic mutations while some rarer forms with 
      conventional mutations. Studies in different populations revealed differences in 
      their relative frequencies both within and between the studied populations, 
      showing that the frequencies are depended on ethnic and geographical factors. 
      Previous investigation of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in the Cypriot population, revealed no 
      pathogenic expansion in the Cypriot SCA patients. We hereby present our recent 
      investigation of the SCA10 pentanucleotide repeat expansion. Forty-two 
      ascertained Cypriot sporadic ataxia patients, the index case from 1 ADCA and 14 
      ARCA families and a cohort of normal population individuals were included in the 
      study. All our patients have normal range ATXN10 gene ATTCT repeat numbers 
      (10-19). In the normal population group, repeat lengths ranged from 11 to 20 with 
      the 14 repeats allele being the most frequent. Therefore, all currently 
      established dynamic repeat SCA mutations are absent from the Cypriot population, 
      indicating distinct genetic causes.

TI  - Transgenic mice with SCA10 pentanucleotide repeats show motor phenotype and 
      susceptibility to seizure: a toxic RNA gain-of-function model.
PG  - 706-14
LID - 10.1002/jnr.22786 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder manifested by ataxia and seizure. SCA10 is caused by a large expansion 
      of an intronic ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat in the ATXN10 gene. We have recently 
      postulated a toxic RNA-mediated gain of function in the pathogenesis of spinal 
      cerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10). The spliced intron-9 RNA containing the 
      expanded AUUCU repeat aggregates in SCA10 cells and sequesters hnRNP K. hnRNP K 
      sequestration triggers the translocation of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) to 
      mitochondria, leading to activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis. To confirm the 
      toxic RNA-mediated gain of function, we generated a new transgenic mouse model in 
      which the expanded pentanucleotide repeats are constructed in the 3'-untranslated 
      region (3'UTR) to ensure transcription without translation of the repeat. We 
      constructed an artificial transgene containing the SCA10 (ATTCT)(500) track 
      within the 3'UTR of the LacZ gene driven by the rat prion promoter (PrP) and used 
      this to generate a new transgenic mouse model for SCA10. We then examined these 
      mice for neurological phenotypes and histopathological, molecular, and cellular 
      changes. The transgenic mice showed irregular gait and increased seizure 
      susceptibility at the age of 6 months, resembling the clinical phenotype of 
      SCA10. The cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and pontine nuclei showed neuronal loss. 
      The brains of these animals also showed molecular and cellular changes similar to 
      those previously found in an SCA10 cell model. Expression of the expanded SCA10 
      AUUCU repeat within the 3'UTR of a gene results in neuronal loss with associated 
      gait abnormalities and increased seizure susceptibility phenotypes, which 
      resemble those seen in SCA10 patients. Moreover, these results bolster the idea 
      that the SCA10 disease mechanism is mediated by a toxic RNA gain-of-function 
      mutation of the expanded AUUCU repeat.

TI  - Detection of large expansions in SCA8 using a fluorescent repeat-primed PCR 
      assay.
PG  - 63-6
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia. It is caused by 
      bidirectional expression of (CUG)n expansion in the ATXN80S/ATXN8 gene and (CAG)n 
      expansion transcripts in ATXN8. The diagnosis of SCA8 must be confirmed by the 
      presence of a (CTG)n trinucleotide repeat expansion in the ATXN8OS gene. On the 
      other hand, there are many human genetic diseases that are caused by expansion of 
      short tandem repeats. Since Werner et al proposed a repeat-primed fluorescent PCR 
      to detect large CTG-repeats in myotonic dystrophy, Friedreich ataxia, SCA2, SCA7, 
      SCA10 and SCA12 have been reported. In this study, we applied a fluorescent PCR 
      method for detection of expanded repeats in the ATXN8OS/ATXN8 gene. Although this 
      test cannot give a precise estimate of the size of the expansion, it proved 
      useful for confirming the presence of expansions in SCA8.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by 
      large-scale expansions of the (ATTCT)(n) repeat within an intron of the human 
      ATXN10 gene. In contrast to other expandable repeats, this pentanucleotide repeat 
      does not form stable intra- or interstranded DNA structures, being a DNA 
      unwinding element instead. We analyzed the instability of the (ATTCT)(n) repeat 
      in a yeast experimental system, where its expansions led to inactivation of the 
      URA3 reporter gene. The inactivation was due to a dramatic decrease in the mRNA 
      levels owing to premature transcription termination and RNA polyadenylation at 
      the repeat. The rates of expansions strongly increased with the repeat's length, 
      mimicking genetic anticipation in human pedigrees. A first round of genetic 
      analysis showed that a functional TOF1 gene precludes, whereas a functional RAD5 
      gene promotes, expansions of the (ATTCT)(n) repeat. We hypothesize that repeat 
      expansions could occur upon fortuitous template switching during DNA replication. 
      The rate of repeat contractions was elevated in the Tof1 knockout strain, but it 
      was not affected by the RAD5 gene. Supporting the notion of replication 
      irregularities, we found that (ATTCT)(n) repeats also cause length-dependent 
      chromosomal fragility in yeast. Repeat-mediated fragility was also affected by 
      the Tof1 and Rad5 proteins, being reduced in their absence.

TI  - The DNA unwinding element binding protein DUE-B interacts with Cdc45 in 
      preinitiation complex formation.
PG  - 1495-507
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00710-09 [doi]
AB  - Template unwinding during DNA replication initiation requires the loading of the 
      MCM helicase activator Cdc45 at replication origins. We show that Cdc45 interacts 
      with the DNA unwinding element (DUE) binding protein DUE-B and that these 
      proteins localize to the DUEs of active replication origins. DUE-B and Cdc45 are 
      not bound at the inactive c-myc replicator in the absence of a functional DUE or 
      at the recently identified ataxin 10 (ATX10) origin, which is silent before 
      disease-related (ATTCT)(n) repeat length expansion of its DUE sequence, despite 
      the presence of the origin recognition complex (ORC) and MCM proteins at these 
      origins. Addition of a heterologous DUE to the ectopic c-myc origin, or expansion 
      of the ATX10 DUE, leads to origin activation, DUE-B binding, and Cdc45 binding. 
      DUE-B, Cdc45, and topoisomerase IIbeta binding protein 1 (TopBP1) form complexes 
      in cell extracts and when expressed from baculovirus vectors. During replication 
      in Xenopus egg extracts, DUE-B and Cdc45 bind to chromatin with similar kinetics, 
      and DUE-B immunodepletion blocks replication and the loading of Cdc45 and a 
      fraction of TopBP1. The coordinated binding of DUE-B and Cdc45 to origins and the 
      physical interactions of DUE-B, Cdc45, and TopBP1 suggest that complexes of these 
      proteins are necessary for replication initiation.

TI  - Alu-mediated acquisition of unstable ATTCT pentanucleotide repeats in the human 
      ATXN10 gene.
PG  - 2573-9
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msp172 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 is caused by ATTCT repeat expansion in the ATXN10 
      gene in humans. We studied the evolutionary history of the human genome to 
      determine the time and mechanism of the acquisition of unstable ATTCT repeats in 
      the genome. We found that long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) was inserted into 
      ATXN10 intron 9; Alu was then inserted in the middle of LINE-1; and endogenous 
      retrovilcus K was lastly retrotransposed in the middle of Alu. The ATTCT repeat 
      was located on the boundary between the 3'-end of the Alu element and the direct 
      repeat arising from LINE-1. We determined nucleotide sequences of the orthologous 
      region of 50 individuals representing 33 primate species and compared them with 
      the human sequence. The analysis revealed that the ATTCT repeat is present only 
      in human and apes. Old World monkeys also possess pentanucleotide repeats, but 
      their motifs are TGTCT and GGTCT. New World monkeys and prosimians are not 
      informative because they lack the corresponding region in ATXN10 intron 9. Our 
      studies dictate two parsimonious scenarios of evolution. First, a TTTCT motif 
      arose from a TTTTT motif at the junction of Alu and LINE-1, which was followed by 
      introduction of A to make an ATTCT motif in hominoids. Second, an ATTCT motif was 
      directly generated from an ancestral ATTTT motif in the common ancestor of 
      catarrhines. We also demonstrate that orangutan uniquely introduced G to make a 
      GTTCT motif and later C to make a GTTCC motif, where newly introduced nucleotides 
      are underlined. Our studies reveal that nucleotide substitutions in a poly(A) 
      tail of the Alu element and the following amplification of pentanucleotides 
      occurred in the lineages of Old World monkeys and hominoids and that unstable 
      ATTCT pentanucleotide repeats originated in the common ancestor of hominoids. 
      These findings also highlight a new aspect of the role of retrotransposons in 
      human disease and evolution, which might be useful in investigating the mystery 
      of human uniqueness.

TI  - Genetic instabilities of (CCTG).(CAGG) and (ATTCT).(AGAAT) disease-associated 
      repeats reveal multiple pathways for repeat deletion.
PG  - 336-49
LID - 10.1002/mc.20534 [doi]
AB  - The DNA repeats (CTG).(CAG), (CGG).(CCG), (GAA).(TTC), (ATTCT).(AGAAT), and 
      (CCTG).(CAGG), undergo expansion in humans leading to neurodegenerative disease. 
      A genetic assay for repeat instability has revealed that the activities of RecA 
      and RecB during replication restart are involved in a high rate of deletion of 
      (CTG).(CAG) repeats in E. coli. This assay has been applied to (CCTG).(CAGG) 
      repeats associated with myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) that expand to 11 000 
      copies and to spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) (ATTCT).(AGAAT) repeats that 
      expand to 4500 copies in affected individuals. DM2 (CCTG).(CAGG) repeats show a 
      moderate rate of instability, less than that observed for the myotonic dystrophy 
      type 1 (CTG).(CAG) repeats, while the SCA10 (ATTCT).(AGAAT) repeats were 
      remarkably stable in E. coli. In contrast to (CTG).(CAG) repeats, deletions of 
      the DM2 and SCA10 repeats were not dependent on RecA and RecB, suggesting that 
      replication restart may not be a predominant mechanism by which these repeats 
      undergo deletion. These results suggest that different molecular mechanisms, or 
      pathways, are responsible for the instability of different disease-associated DNA 
      repeats in E. coli. These pathways involve simple replication slippage and 
      various sister strand exchange events leading to deletions or expansions, often 
      associated with plasmid dimerization. The differences in the mechanisms of repeat 
      deletion may result from the differential propensity of these repeats to form 
      various DNA secondary structures and their differential proclivity for 
      primer-template misalignment during replication.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease characterized by cerebellar ataxia and seizures. The disease is caused by 
      a large ATTCT repeat expansion in the ATXN10 gene. The first families reported 
      with SCA10 were of Mexican origin, but the disease was soon after described in 
      Brazilian families of mixed Portuguese and Amerindian ancestry. The origin of the 
      SCA10 expansion and a possible founder effect that would account for its 
      geographical distribution have been the source of speculation over the last 
      years. To unravel the mutational origin and spread of the SCA10 expansion, we 
      performed an extensive haplotype study, using closely linked STR markers and 
      intragenic SNPs, in families from Brazil and Mexico. Our results showed (1) a 
      shared disease haplotype for all Brazilian and one of the Mexican families, and 
      (2) closely-related haplotypes for the additional SCA10 Mexican families; (3) 
      little or null genetic distance in small normal alleles of different repeat 
      sizes, from the same SNP lineage, indicating that they are being originated by a 
      single step mechanism; and (4) a shared haplotype for pure and interrupted 
      expanded alleles, pointing to a gene conversion model for its generation. In 
      conclusion, we show evidence for an ancestral common origin for SCA10 in Latin 
      America, which might have arisen in an ancestral Amerindian population and later 
      have been spread into the mixed populations of Mexico and Brazil.

LID - 10.1016/j.gene.2008.12.011 [doi]
AB  - Nucleosome packaging influences many aspects of DNA metabolism such as 
      replication, repair and transcription, and via this link likely has further 
      downstream effects on genome stability. The instability and expansion of 
      repetitive sequences is associated with at least 42 human diseases, yet the 
      molecular conditions contributing to repeat instability have remained largely 
      undetermined. Previously we showed strong nucleosome formation on CAG repeats 
      associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 and very weak formation on CGG 
      repeats associated with fragile X syndrome, and that interruption of these repeat 
      tracts made the DNA behave more like random sequences. In this study, we 
      determined nucleosome formation on pure and interrupted ATTCT pentanucleotides 
      associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10). We report strong 
      nucleosome formation on ATTCT repeats, like CAG tracts. Surprisingly, in contrast 
      to the effect of interruptions on other repeat sequences, interruptions in the 
      expanded ATTCT tracts further strengthened assembly with hyperacetylated histones 
      under physiological conditions with NAP-1. These differences may contribute to 
      phenotypic variation seen between families having pure and interrupted SCA10 
      repeats, as well as the overall genetic instability at the SCA10 locus.

TI  - Case control analysis of repeat expansion size in ataxia.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurological diseases. The expansion of unstable microsatellite 
      repeats has been identified as the underlying pathogenic cause of 10 subtypes of 
      autosomal dominant SCAs. The aetiology of sporadic SCA is unknown. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effect of large normal repeats in patients 
      presenting with sporadic or familial ataxia compared to a control population. The 
      size of the expansion was determined using a fluorescent PCR approach in 10 
      common SCA genes: SCA-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 (CACNA1A), 
      SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), SCA-17 (TBP) 
      and DRPLA (ATN1), in 165 ataxia patients and 307 controls of Welsh origin. There 
      was no difference between cases and controls in the distribution of the large 
      normal alleles, or in the distribution of the combined CAG repeats. The normal 
      allele distribution in the Welsh population was largely similar to that of other 
      Caucasian populations. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of large normal 
      repeats on the susceptibility to develop ataxia.

TI  - Unstable spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (ATTCT*(AGAAT) repeats are associated 
      with aberrant replication at the ATX10 locus and replication origin-dependent 
      expansion at an ectopic site in human cells.
PG  - 7828-38
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is associated with expansion of (ATTCT)n 
      repeats (where n is the number of repeats) within the ataxin 10 (ATX10/E46L) 
      gene. The demonstration that (ATTCT)n tracts can act as DNA unwinding elements 
      (DUEs) in vitro has suggested that aberrant replication origin activity occurs at 
      expanded (ATTCT)n tracts and may lead to their instability. Here, we confirm 
      these predictions. The wild-type ATX10 locus displays inefficient origin 
      activity, but origin activity is elevated at the expanded ATX10 loci in 
      patient-derived cells. To test whether (ATTCT)n tracts can potentiate origin 
      activity, cell lines were constructed that contain ectopic copies of the c-myc 
      replicator in which the essential DUE was replaced by ATX10 DUEs with (ATTCT)n. 
      ATX10 DUEs containing (ATTCT)27 or (ATTCT)48, but not (ATTCT)8 or (ATTCT)13, 
      could substitute functionally for the c-myc DUE, but (ATTCT)48 could not act as 
      an autonomous replicator. Significantly, chimeric c-myc replicators containing 
      ATX10 DUEs displayed length-dependent (ATTCT)n instability. By 250 population 
      doublings, dramatic two- and fourfold length expansions were observed for 
      (ATTCT)27 and (ATTCT)48 but not for (ATTCT)8 or (ATTCT)13. These results 
      implicate replication origin activity as one molecular mechanism associated with 
      the instability of (ATTCT)n tracts that are longer than normal length.

TI  - The role of ataxin 10 in the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 10.
PG  - 607-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal dominant 
      disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia and seizures. SCA10 is caused by an 
      expansion of an ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat in intron 9 of the ataxin 10 
      (ATXN10) gene encoding an approximately 55-kd protein of unknown function. 
      However, how this mutation leads to SCA10 is unknown. METHODS: In an effort to 
      understand the pathogenic mechanism of SCA10, the authors conducted a series of 
      experiments to address the effect of repeat expansion on the transcription and 
      RNA processing of the ATXN10 gene. In addition, we generated Sca10 (mouse ataxin 
      10 homolog)-null mice and addressed the role of Sca10 gene dosage on the 
      cerebellum. RESULTS: Mutant ATXN10 allele is transcribed at the normal level, and 
      the pre-mRNA containing an expanded repeat is processed normally in 
      patient-derived cells. Sca10-null mice exhibited embryonic lethality. 
      Heterozygous mutants were overtly normal and did not develop SCA10 phenotype 
      CONCLUSION: A simple gain of function or loss of function of ATXN10 is unlikely 
      to be the major pathogenic mechanism contributing to the spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 10 phenotype.

TI  - Ataxin 10 induces neuritogenesis via interaction with G-protein beta2 subunit.
PG  - 1170-8
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a dominantly inherited disorder caused 
      by an intronic ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat expansion. The ATXN10 gene encodes a 
      novel protein, ataxin 10, known previously as E46L, which is widely expressed in 
      the brain. Ataxin 10 deficiency has been shown recently to cause increased 
      apoptosis in primary cerebellar cultures, thus implicated in SCA10 pathogenesis. 
      The biologic functions of ataxin 10 remain largely unknown. By using 
      yeast-two-hybrid screening of a human brain cDNA library, we identified the 
      G-protein beta2 subunit (Gbeta2) as an ataxin 10 binding partner, and the 
      interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization in 
      mammalian cells in culture. Overexpression of ataxin 10 in PC12 cells induced 
      neurite extension and enhanced neuronal differentiation induced by nerve growth 
      factor (NGF). Moreover, coexpression of ataxin 10 and Gbeta2 potently activated 
      the Ras-MAP kinase-Elk-1 cascade. Dominant negative Ras or inhibitor of MEK-1/2 
      (U0126) aborted this activation, and blocked morphologic changes, whereas 
      inhibition of TrkA receptor by K252a had no effects. Our data suggest that the 
      ataxin 10-Gbeta2 interaction represents a novel mechanism for inducing 
      neuritogenesis in PC12 cells by activating the Ras-MAP kinase-Elk-1 cascade.

TI  - Interruptions in the expanded ATTCT repeat of spinocerebellar ataxia type 10: 
      repeat purity as a disease modifier?
PG  - 125-9
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is one of numerous genetic disorders that 
      result from simple repeat expansions. SCA10 is caused by expansion of an intronic 
      ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat tract. It is clinically characterized by progressive 
      ataxia, seizures, and anticipation, which can vary within and between families. 
      We report two SCA10 families showing distinct frequencies of seizures and 
      correlations of repeat length with age at onset. One family displayed 
      uninterrupted ATTCT expansions, whereas the other showed multiple interruptions 
      of the repeat by nonconsensus repeat units, which differed both in the length 
      and/or sequence of the repeat unit. Disease-causing microsatellite expansions 
      have been assumed to be composed of uninterrupted pure repeats. Our findings for 
      SCA10 challenge this convention and suggest that the purity of the expanded 
      repeat element may be a disease modifier.

TI  - Clinical phenotype of Brazilian families with spinocerebellar ataxia 10.
PG  - 1509-12
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal dominant ataxia caused by 
      an ATTCT repeat expansion in an intron of the SCA10 gene. SCA10 has been reported 
      only in Mexican families, in which the disease showed a combination of cerebellar 
      ataxia and epilepsy. The authors report 28 SCA10 patients from five new Brazilian 
      families. All 28 patients showed cerebellar ataxia without epilepsy, suggesting 
      that the phenotypic expression of the SCA10 mutation differs between Brazilian 
      and Mexican families.

TI  - Ataxin-10, the spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 neurodegenerative disorder protein, 
      is essential for survival of cerebellar neurons.
PG  - 35542-50
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 10, an autosomal dominant disease characterized 
      by cerebellar ataxia, is caused by a novel pentanucleotide (ATTCT) repeat 
      expansion in the SCA10 gene. Although clinical features of the disease are well 
      characterized, nothing is known so far about the affected SCA10 gene product, 
      ataxin-10 (Atx-10). We have cloned the rat SCA10 gene and expressed the 
      corresponding protein in HEK293 cells. Atx-10 has an apparent molecular mass of 
      approximately 55 kDa and belongs to the family of armadillo repeat proteins. In 
      solution, it tends to form homotrimeric complexes, which associate via a 
      tip-to-tip contact with the concave sides of the molecules facing each other. 
      Atx-10 immunostaining of mouse and human brain sections revealed a predominantly 
      cytoplasmic and perinuclear localization with a clear restriction to 
      olivocerebellar regions. Knock down of SCA10 in primary neuronal cells by small 
      interfering RNAs resulted in an increased apoptosis of cerebellar neurons, 
      arguing for a loss-of-function phenotype in SCA10 patients.

TI  - Molecular genetics of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia: mutation analysis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia genes and CAG/CTG repeat expansion detection in 225 
      Italian families.
PG  - 727-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, at present 
      associated with 22 loci (spinocerebellar ataxia [SCA] 1-SCA8, SCA10-SCA19, SCA21, 
      SCA22, fibroblast growth factor 14 [FGF14]-SCA, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy [DRPLA]). The relevant gene has been identified in 12 cases (SCA1-3, 
      SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, FGF14, and DRPLA), and in all but the recently identified 
      SCA14, SCA17, PRKCG and FGF14 genes, the defect consists of the expansion of a 
      short nucleotide repeat. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relative prevalence of 
      SCA1-3, SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, and SCA17 gene expansions in Italian families with 
      hereditary ataxia, specifically to verify the occurrence of SCA10, SCA12, and 
      SCA17 in Italy; and to analyze samples from probands with negative test results 
      at the initial screening by means of the repeat expansion detection technique to 
      identify CAG/CTG expansions in novel loci.Patients Two hundred twenty-five 
      unrelated Italian index cases with hereditary ataxia, most (n = 183) of whom 
      presented with a clear dominantly transmitted trait. RESULTS: We found that SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene mutations accounted for most cases (21% and 24%, respectively). We 
      found SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, and SCA17 to be very rare (approximately 1% each), 
      and no case of SCA10 or SCA12 was identified. Half of the index cases (113/225) 
      were negative for expansions in the known SCA genes. Repeat expansion detection 
      analysis performed on 111 of these cases showed a CAG/CTG repeat expansion of at 
      least 50 triplets in 22 (20%). Twenty-one of 22 expansions could be attributed to 
      length variation at 2 polymorphic loci (expanded repeat domain CAG/CTG 1 [ERDA1] 
      or CTG repeat on chromosome 18q21.1 [CTG18.1]). In 1 patient, the expansion was 
      assigned to the DRPLA gene. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of SCA1-3 and SCA6-7 
      gene mutations is peculiar in Italy. We found a relatively high frequency of SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene expansions; SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 mutations were rare, compared with 
      other European countries. No SCA10 or SCA12 and only a few SCA8 (2/225) and SCA17 
      (2/225) families were detected. In patients negative for defects in known SCA 
      genes, repeat expansion detection data strongly suggest that, at least in our 
      population, CAG/CTG expansions in novel genes should be considered an unlikely 
      cause of the SCA phenotype.

TI  - Detection of large pathogenic expansions in FRDA1, SCA10, and SCA12 genes using a 
      simple fluorescent repeat-primed PCR assay.
PG  - 96-100
AB  - At least 18 human genetic diseases are caused by expansion of short tandem 
      repeats. Here we describe a successful application of a fluorescent PCR method 
      for the detection of expanded repeats in FRDA1, SCA10, and SCA12 genes. Although 
      this test cannot give a precise estimate of the size of the expansion, it is 
      robust, reliable, and inexpensive, and can be used to screen large series of 
      patients. It proved useful for confirming the presence of large expansions in the 
      Friedreich ataxia gene following an ambiguous result of long-range PCR, as well 
      as rapid pre-screening for large repeat expansions associated with Friedreich 
      ataxia and SCA10 and the shorter repeat expansions associated with SCA12.

TI  - A novel autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA22) linked to chromosome 
      1p21-q23.
PG  - 1293-9
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically, pathologically 
      and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. Ten responsible genes have been 
      identified for spinocerebellar ataxia types SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, 
      SCA10, SCA12 and SCA17, and dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      mutation is caused by an expansion of a CAG, CTG or ATTCT repeat sequence of 
      these genes. Six additional loci, SCA4, SCA5, SCA11, SCA13, SCA14 and SCA16 have 
      also been mapped. The growing heterogeneity of the autosomal dominant forms of 
      these diseases shows that the genetic aetiologies of at least 20% of ADCA have 
      yet to be elucidated. We ascertained and clinically characterized a 
      four-generation Chinese pedigree segregating an autosomal dominant phenotype for 
      cerebellar ataxia. Direct mutation analysis, linkage analysis for all known SCA 
      loci and a genome-wide linkage study were performed. Direct mutation analysis 
      excluded SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17 and DRPLA, and genetic linkage analysis 
      excluded SCA4, 5, 11, 13, 14 and 16. The genome-wide linkage study suggested 
      linkage to a locus on chromosome 1p21-q23, with the highest two-point LOD score 
      at D1S1167 (Zmax = 3.46 at theta = 0.00). Multipoint analysis and haplotype 
      reconstruction traced this novel SCA locus (SCA22) to a 43.7-cM interval flanked 
      by D1S206 and D1S2878 (Zmax = 3.78 under four liability classes, and 2.67 using 
      affected-only method). The age at onset ranged from 10 to 46 years. All affected 
      members had gait ataxia with variable features of dysarthria and hyporeflexia. 
      Head MRI showed homogeneous atrophy of the cerebellum without involvement of the 
      brainstem. In six parent-child pairs, median onset occurred 10 years earlier in 
      offspring than in their parents, suggesting anticipation. This family is distinct 
      from other families with SCA and is characterized by a slowly progressive, pure 
      cerebellar ataxia.

TI  - Unpaired structures in SCA10 (ATTCT)n.(AGAAT)n repeats.
PG  - 1095-111
AB  - A number of human hereditary diseases have been associated with the instability 
      of DNA repeats in the genome. Recently, spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 has been 
      associated with expansion of the pentanucleotide repeat (ATTCT)(n).(AGAAT)(n) 
      from a normal range of ten to 22 to as many as 4500 copies. The structural 
      properties of this repeat cloned in circular plasmids were studied by a variety 
      of methods. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and atomic force microscopy 
      detected local DNA unpairing in supercoiled plasmids. Chemical probing analysis 
      indicated that, at moderate superhelical densities, the (ATTCT)(n).(AGAAT)(n) 
      repeat forms an unpaired region, which further extends into adjacent A+T-rich 
      flanking sequences at higher superhelical densities. The superhelical energy 
      required to initiate duplex unpairing is essentially length-independent from 
      eight to 46 repeats. In plasmids containing five repeats, minimal unpairing of 
      (ATTCT)(5).(AGAAT)(5) occurred while 2D gel analysis and chemical probing 
      indicate greater unpairing in A+T-rich sequences in other regions of the plasmid. 
      The observed experimental results are consistent with a statistical mechanical, 
      computational analysis of these supercoiled plasmids. For plasmids containing 29 
      repeats, which is just above the normal human size range, flanked by an A+T-rich 
      sequence, atomic force microscopy detected the formation of a locally condensed 
      structure at high superhelical densities. However, even at high superhelical 
      densities, DNA strands within the presumably compact A+T-rich region were 
      accessible to small chemicals and oligonucleotide hybridization. Thus, DNA 
      strands in this "collapsed structure" remain unpaired and accessible for 
      interaction with other molecules. The unpaired DNA structure functioned as an 
      aberrant replication origin, in that it supported complete plasmid replication in 
      a HeLa cell extract. A model is proposed in which unscheduled or aberrant DNA 
      replication is a critical step in the expansion mutation.

TI  - Spastic paraplegia, ataxia, mental retardation (SPAR): a novel genetic disorder.
PG  - 411-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a kindred with a dominantly inherited neurologic disorder 
      manifested either as uncomplicated spastic paraplegia or ataxia, spastic 
      paraplegia, and mental retardation. METHODS: Neurologic examinations and 
      molecular genetic analysis (exclusion of known SCA and HSP genes and loci; and 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion detection [RED]) were performed in six affected 
      and four unaffected subjects in this family. MRI, electromyography (EMG), and 
      nerve conduction studies were performed in three affected subjects. RESULTS: The 
      phenotype of this dominantly inherited syndrome varied in succeeding generations. 
      Pure spastic paraplegia was present in the earliest generation; subsequent 
      generations had ataxia and mental retardation. MRI showed marked atrophy of the 
      spinal cord in all patients and cerebellar atrophy in those with ataxia. 
      Laboratory analysis showed that the disorder was not caused by mutations in genes 
      that cause SCA-1, SCA-2, SCA-3, SCA-6, SCA-7, SCA-8, and SCA-12; not linked to 
      other known loci for autosomal dominant ataxia (SCA-4, SCA-5, SCA-10, SCA-11, 
      SCA-13, SCA-14, and SCA-16); and not linked to known loci for autosomal dominant 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (SPG-3, SPG-4, SPG-6, SPG-8, SPG-9, SPG-10, 
      SPG-12, and SPG-13) or autosomal recessive HSP SPG-7. Analysis of 
      intergenerational differences in age at onset of symptoms suggests genetic 
      anticipation. Using RED, the authors did not detect expanded CAG, CCT, TGG, or 
      CGT repeats that segregate with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The authors describe an 
      unusual, dominantly inherited neurologic disorder in which the phenotype (pure 
      spastic paraplegia or spastic ataxia with variable mental retardation) differed 
      in subsequent generations. The molecular explanation for apparent genetic 
      anticipation does not appear to involve trinucleotide repeat expansion.

TI  - Clinical features and genetic analysis of a new form of spinocerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 234-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically 
      heterogeneous group of disorders. The mutations for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, and SCA-12 are identified and caused by an expansion of a CAG or a CTG 
      repeat sequence of these genes. Six additional loci for SCA4, SCA5, SCA-10, 
      SCA-11, SCA-13, and SCA-14 are mapped. The growing heterogeneity of the autosomal 
      dominant forms of these diseases shows that the genetic etiologies of at least 
      20% of ADCA have yet to be elucidated. METHODS: The authors ascertained and 
      clinically characterized a four-generation pedigree segregating an autosomal 
      dominant phenotype for SCA. Direct mutation analysis, repeat expansion detection 
      analysis, and linkage analysis for all known SCA loci were performed. RESULTS: 
      Direct mutational analysis excluded SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 12; genetic linkage 
      analysis excluded SCA4, 5,10, 11, 13, and 14, giving significant negative lod 
      scores. Examination of the family showed that all affected members had gait 
      ataxia and akinesia with variable features of dysarthria, hyporeflexia, and mild 
      intellectual impairment. Eye movements were normal. Head MRI showed atrophy of 
      the cerebellum without involvement of the brainstem. In 10 parent-child pairs, 
      median onset occurred 10.5 years earlier in offspring than in their parents, 
      suggesting anticipation. CONCLUSION: This family is distinct from other families 
      with SCA and is characterized by cerebellar ataxia and extrapyramidal signs.

TI  - Large expansion of the ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 10.
PG  - 191-4
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10; MIM 603516; refs 1,2) is an autosomal 
      dominant disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia and seizures. The gene SCA10 
      maps to a 3.8-cM interval on human chromosome 22q13-qter (refs 1,2). Because 
      several other SCA subtypes show trinucleotide repeat expansions, we examined 
      microsatellites in this region. We found an expansion of a pentanucleotide 
      (ATTCT) repeat in intron 9 of SCA10 in all patients in five Mexican SCA10 
      families. There was an inverse correlation between the expansion size, up to 22.5 
      kb larger than the normal allele, and the age of onset (r2=0.34, P=0.018). 
      Analysis of 562 chromosomes from unaffected individuals of various ethnic origins 
      (including 242 chromosomes from Mexican persons) showed a range of 10 to 22 ATTCT 
      repeats with no evidence of expansions. Our data indicate that the new SCA10 
      intronic ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat in SCA10 patients is unstable and 
      represents the largest microsatellite expansion found so far in the human genome.

TI  - Mapping of a new autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia to chromosome 22.
PG  - 594-9
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) are a clinically and 
      genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. The clinical symptoms include 
      cerebellar dysfunction and associated signs from dysfunction in other parts of 
      the nervous system. So far, five spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) genes have been 
      identified: SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7. Loci for SCA4 and SCA5 have been 
      mapped. However, approximately one-third of SCAs have remained unassigned. We 
      have identified a Mexican American pedigree that segregates a new form of ataxia 
      clinically characterized by gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus. Two 
      individuals have seizures. After excluding all known genetic loci for linkage, we 
      performed a genomewide search and identified linkage to a 15-cM region on 
      chromosome 22q13. A maximum LOD score of 4.3 (recombination fraction 0) was 
      obtained for D22S928 and D22S1161. This distinct form of ataxia has been 
      designated "SCA10." Anticipation was observed in the available parent-child 
      pairs, suggesting that trinucleotide-repeat expansion may be the mutagenic 
      mechanism.
