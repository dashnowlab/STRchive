AB  - BACKGROUND: Paired-like Homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) is considered the causative gene of 
      Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS), a dominant genetic disorder 
      characterized by impaired central respiratory control and subsequent 
      hypoventilation during sleep. METHODS: Herein, we present a family with recurrent 
      severe CCHS. The potential causative genetic variant was confirmed through 
      Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES), Sanger sequencing, and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). 
      Furthermore, prenatal diagnosis was performed on the proband's mother at 20 weeks 
      of her fourth pregnancy upon request. RESULTS: The proband and her brother were 
      both carriers of the PHOX2B polyalanine expansion variant: 
      c.744_758dupCGCGGCAGCGGCGGCGGCGGC. Sanger sequencing revealed that the proband's 
      father had a small variant peak in the gene position, implying potential somatic 
      mosaicism. In addition, ddPCR results showed that the proband's father had 
      germline mosaicism, with a mosaicism proportion of 14.3%. Notably, the detect 
      p.(Ala241[26]) variant was not detected in the fetus. CONCLUSIONS: These findings 
      have important implications for improving genetic counseling of CCHS families as 
      they suggest that even parents without CCHS symptoms may have somatic chimerism, 
      necessitating careful genetic counseling and consideration of prenatal testing 
      for subsequent pregnancies.

      hypoventilation syndrome: a case report.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a 
      life-threatening disorder of autonomic respiratory control. Mutations in the 
      paired-like homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) gene impair respiratory drive, causing 
      hypercarbia and hypoxaemia. Most patients with CCHS are diagnosed in the neonatal 
      period; however, a few are diagnosed in adulthood. CASE SUMMARY: We report a 
      32-year-old man with a history of unexplained cyanosis 14 days after birth. He 
      presented to our hospital with breathlessness and abnormal electrocardiogram 
      findings discovered in a health check-up. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) was 
      suspected based on electrocardiographic and echocardiographic evidence of right 
      ventricular (RV) overload. Results of pulmonary function tests and chest computed 
      tomography were normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed type 2 respiratory 
      failure without a significant alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, indicating 
      alveolar hypoventilation. Right heart catheterization (RHC) showed pre-capillary 
      PH [pulmonary artery pressure 47/24 (35) mmHg], and a hyperventilation challenge 
      test and a non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) treatment during RHC 
      provided drastic improvement in PH [pulmonary artery pressure 28/12 (18) mmHg]. 
      Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome was diagnosed based on genetic 
      testing (20/25 polyalanine repeat expansion mutations in PHOX2B). After NPPV 
      therapy initiation, the RV overload was slightly improved. DISCUSSION: Some 
      patients with CCHS develop mild hypoventilation without overt clinical signs, and 
      PH can be the first clinical manifestation. In our case, the hyperventilation 
      challenge test improved PH. Although CCHS causes chronic alveolar hypoxia and 
      hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction with subsequent PH, optimal ventilation 
      therapy can improve pulmonary circulation even in affected adults.

AB  - Abnormal trinucleotide repeat expansions alter protein conformation causing 
      malfunction and contribute to a significant number of incurable human diseases. 
      Scarce structural insights available on disease-related homorepeat expansions 
      hinder the design of effective therapeutics. Here, we present the dynamic 
      structure of human PHOX2B C-terminal fragment, which contains the longest 
      polyalanine segment known in mammals. The major alpha-helical conformation of the 
      polyalanine tract is solely extended by polyalanine expansions in PHOX2B, which 
      are responsible for most congenital central hypoventilation syndrome cases. 
      However, polyalanine expansions in PHOX2B additionally promote nascent homorepeat 
      conformations that trigger length-dependent phase transitions into solid 
      condensates that capture wild-type PHOX2B. Remarkably, HSP70 and HSP90 chaperones 
      specifically seize PHOX2B alternative conformations preventing phase transitions. 
      The precise observation of emerging polymorphs in expanded PHOX2B postulates 
      unbalanced phase transitions as distinct pathophysiological mechanisms in 
      homorepeat expansion diseases, paving the way towards the search of therapeutics 
      modulating biomolecular condensates in central hypoventilation syndrome.

TI  - Characteristics and outcomes in children with congenital central hypoventilation 
      syndrome on long-term mechanical ventilation in the Netherlands.
PG  - 791-797
LID - 10.1007/s00431-023-05339-9 [doi]
AB  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare condition 
      characterized by central hypoventilation, leading to the majority of patients 
      being dependent on ventilatory support during sleep. This condition is often 
      accompanied by various associated symptoms, due to a PHOX2B gene variant involved 
      in neuronal crest cell migration. This study is the first to review the 
      characteristics and outcomes in children with CCHS on long-term mechanical 
      ventilation in the Netherlands. We performed a retrospective study of all CCHS 
      patients treated in the 4 Centers of Home Mechanical Ventilation of the 
      University Medical Centers in the Netherlands from 2000 till 2022 by collecting 
      information from the electronic medical records, documented during follow-up. We 
      included 31 patients, out of which 27 exhibited a known genetic profile 
      associated with CCHS, while no PHOX2B variant was identified in the remaining 
      patients. Among the 27 patients with known genetic profiles, 10 patients had a 
      non-polyalanine repeat expansion mutation (NPARM), followed by 20/27, 20/25, and 
      20/26 polyalanine repeat expansion mutations (PARMs) in descending order. The 
      most common presentation involved respiratory failure or apneas during the 
      neonatal period with an inability to wean off ventilation. The majority of 
      patients required ventilatory support during sleep, with four patients 
      experiencing life-threatening events related to this dependency. Daily use of 
      ventilatory support varied among different genetic profiles. All genotypes 
      reported comorbidities, with Hirschsprung's disease and cardiac arrhythmias being 
      the most reported comorbidities. Notably, Hirschprung's disease was exclusively 
      observed in patients with a 20/27 PHOX2B variant. CONCLUSION: Our study results 
      suggest that in our cohort, the genotype is not easily associated to the 
      phenotype in CCHS. Consistent with these findings and international literature, 
      we recommend a thorough annual evaluation for all patients with CCHS to ensure 
      optimal management and follow-up. WHAT IS KNOWN: * The majority of CCHS patients 
      are dependent on ventilatory support. * Variants in the PHOX2B gene are 
      responsible for the characteristics of CCHS. WHAT IS NEW: * This study provides 
      insight into the clinical course and long-term outcomes of CCHS patients in the 
      Netherlands. * In CCHS, the genotype is not easily associated with the phenotype, 
      requiring a thorough life-long follow-up for all patients.

LID - e73130
AB  - Mutations in the transcription factor Phox2b cause congenital central 
      hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). The syndrome is characterized by hypoventilation 
      and inability to regulate breathing to maintain adequate O(2) and CO(2) levels. 
      The mechanism by which CCHS impact respiratory control is incompletely 
      understood, and even less is known about the impact of the non-polyalanine repeat 
      expansion mutations (NPARM) form. Our goal was to investigate the extent by which 
      NPARM Phox2b mutation affect (a) respiratory rhythm; (b) ventilatory responses to 
      hypercapnia (HCVR) and hypoxia (HVR); and (c) number of chemosensitive neurons in 
      mice. We used a transgenic mouse line carrying a conditional Phox2b(Delta8) mutation 
      (same found in humans with NPARM CCHS). We crossed them with Atoh1(cre) mice to 
      introduce mutation in regions involved with respiratory function and central 
      chemoreflex control. Ventilation was measured by plethysmograph during neonatal 
      and adult life. In room air, mutation in neonates and adult did not greatly 
      impact basal ventilation. However, Phox2b(Delta8), Atoh1(cre) increased breath 
      irregularity in adults. The HVR and HCVR were impaired in neonates. The HVR, but 
      not HCVR, was still partially compromised in adults. The mutation reduced the 
      number of Phox2b(+)/TH(-)-expressing neurons as well as the number of 
      fos-activated cells within the ventral parafacial region (also named 
      retrotrapezoid nucleus [RTN] region) induced by hypercapnia. Our data indicates 
      that Phox2b(Delta8) mutation in Atoh1-expressing cells impaired RTN neurons, as well 
      as chemoreflex under hypoxia and hypercapnia specially early in life. This study 
      provided new evidence for mechanisms related to NPARM form of CCHS

AB  - Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) is a rare disorder of the 
      autonomic nervous system (ANS), characterized by inadequate control of autonomic 
      ventilation and global autonomic dysfunction. Heterozygous polyalanine repeat 
      expansion mutations in exon 3 of the transcription factor Paired-like homeobox 2B 
      (PHOX2B) gene occur in 90% of CCHS cases. In this study, we describe the 
      generation and characterization of two human induced pluripotent stem cell 
      (hiPSC) lines from female CCHS patients carrying a heterozygous + 5 alanine 
      expansion mutation. The generated iPSC lines show a normal karyotype, express 
      pluripotency markers and are able to differentiate into the three germ layers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is an extremely 
      rare genetic disorder characterized by Autonomic nervous system dysregulation 
      caused by mutations in the PHOX2B gene. Here we introduce the first genetic 
      analysis of a one-month-old CCHS baby girl in Iran. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genetic 
      analysis of the PHOX2B gene was performed by Sanger sequencing and interpreted 
      using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guideline. The 
      results showed a heterozygous duplication in exon 3, causing a polyalanine repeat 
      expansion mutation to 27 repeats in thePHOX2B gene (20/27 genotype).The patient's 
      parents did not demonstrate this mutation on genetic studies. CONCLUSIONS: 
      According to the ACMG guideline, the mutation is pathogenic, and it was a denovo 
      mutation in the family. The genetic study can help the family for prenatal 
      diagnosis or pre-implantation diagnosis if the parents have gonadal mosaicism.

TI  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome in neonates: report of fourteen new 
      cases and a review of the literature.
PG  - 733-745
LID - 10.21037/tp-20-303 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare 
      autosomal dominant disorder caused by pathogenic variants in paired-like homeobox 
      2B (PHOX2B) gene. Characteristics of neonatal-onset CCHS cases have not been well 
      assessed. The aim of this study is to expand current knowledge of clinical and 
      genetic features of neonates with CCHS and provide data on the genotype-phenotype 
      correlation. METHODS: We made a retrospective analysis of 14 neonates carrying 
      PHOX2B pathogenic variants from 2014 to 2019 and we reviewed previously published 
      neonatal-onset cases. Clinical and genetic data were analyzed. Moreover, 
      genotype-phenotype correlation analysis was performed. RESULTS: We identified a 
      total of 60 neonatal-onset CCHS cases (35 males and 25 females) including 14 
      novel cases from our local cohort. Nearly 20% (18.2%) of the patients were born 
      prematurely. Nearly half (46.2%) of the patients had abnormal family history. 
      Polyhydramnios was observed in 21.3% (10/47) of the patients. About 90% of the 
      patients manifested symptoms of hypoventilation in the first week of life. 
      Fourteen patients (23.3%) were classified as mild-CCHS and the rest were 
      severe-CCHS. Gastrointestinal manifestations were observed in 71.7% of the 
      patients. Approximately twofold more males than females were affected by 
      Hirschprung disease (HSCR)/variant HSCR (75.8% vs. 35%, P=0.003). Neural crest 
      tumor occurred in 9.1% (4/44) patients. Half patients had polyalanine repeat 
      expansion mutations (PARMs) in PHOX2B (seven with 25 PARM, nine with 26 PARM, 
      twelve with 27 PARM, one with 28 PARM and one with 31 PARM) and the other half 
      patients had 23 distinct non-polyalanine repeat expansion mutations (NPARMs) with 
      one novel pathogenic variant (c.684dup). The prevalence of HSCR and mild-CCHS 
      among patients with NPARMs was significantly greater than that of the patients 
      with PARMs. CONCLUSIONS: This report provides a large cohort of neonatal-onset 
      CCHS cases. The results indicate that severe hypoventilation and HSCR are 
      frequently observed in this group. NPARMs accounted for half of the cohort with 
      some genotypes tend to be associated with mild phenotype. Molecular testing in 
      neonates with suspicion of CCHS and genetic counseling for CCHS families are 
      highly recommended.

TI  - Paired-like homeobox gene (PHOX2B) nonpolyalanine repeat expansion mutations 
      (NPARMs): genotype-phenotype correlation in congenital central hypoventilation 
      syndrome (CCHS).
PG  - 1656-1663
LID - 10.1038/s41436-021-01178-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: CCHS is an extremely rare congenital disorder requiring artificial 
      ventilation as life support. Typically caused by heterozygous polyalanine repeat 
      expansion mutations (PARMs) in the PHOX2B gene, identification of a relationship 
      between PARM length and phenotype severity has enabled anticipatory management. 
      However, for patients with non-PARMs in PHOX2B (NPARMs, ~10% of CCHS patients), a 
      genotype-phenotype correlation has not been established. This comprehensive 
      report of PHOX2B NPARMs and associated phenotypes, aims at elucidating potential 
      genotype-phenotype correlations that will guide anticipatory management. METHODS: 
      An international collaboration (clinical, commercial, and research laboratories) 
      was established to collect/share information on novel and previously published 
      PHOX2B NPARM cases. Variants were categorized by type and gene location. 
      Categorical data were analyzed with chi-square and Fisher's exact test; further 
      pairwise comparisons were made on significant results. RESULTS: Three hundred two 
      individuals with PHOX2B NPARMs were identified, including 139 previously 
      unreported cases. Findings demonstrate significant associations between key 
      phenotypic manifestations of CCHS and variant type, location, and predicted 
      effect on protein function. CONCLUSION: This study presents the largest cohort of 
      PHOX2B NPARMs and associated phenotype data to date, enabling genotype-phenotype 
      studies that will advance personalized, anticipatory management and help 
      elucidate pathological mechanisms. Further characterization of PHOX2B NPARMs 
      demands longitudinal clinical follow-up through international registries.

AB  - Background: Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare disorder 
      whose clinical phenotype is closely related to genotype. Methods: A retrospective 
      analysis has been conducted on 22 patients with CCHS, who were referred to the 
      Pediatric Pulmonology and Respiratory Intermediate Care Unit of Bambino Gesu 
      Children's Hospital (Italy) for a multidisciplinary follow-up program between 
      2000 and 2020. Results: Apnea and cyanosis were the most frequent symptoms at 
      onset (91%). Overall, 59% of patients required tracheostomy and invasive 
      mechanical ventilation (IMV) in the first months of life. Thirty-two percent of 
      patients had Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) that was associated with longer 
      polyalanine repetitions or non-polyalanine repeat expansion mutations (NPARMs). 
      Polyalanine repeat expansion mutations (PARMs) were more frequent and two novel 
      NPARMs (c.780dupT and C.225-256delCT) were described in 14% of patients. Focal 
      epilepsy was first described in 14% of patients and neurocognitive and neuromotor 
      impairment involved 27% and 23% of children, respectively. Symptoms due to 
      autonomic nervous system dysfunction/dysregulation (ANSD)-including strabismus 
      (27%), dysphagia (27%), abnormal heart rhythm (10%), breath-holding spells (9%), 
      and recurrent seizures due to hypoglycemia (9%)-were associated with an increased 
      number of polyalanine repetitions of exon 3 or NPARMs of PHOX2B gene. Overall, 
      the number of patients with moderate to severe phenotype initially treated with 
      non-invasive ventilation (NIV) increased over time, and the decannulation program 
      was concluded with 3 patients who started with IMV. Conclusions: Our study 
      confirms that more severe phenotypes of CCHS are related to the number of 
      polyalanine repetitions or to NPARMs. Although invasive ventilation is often 
      required by patients with severe genotype/phenotype, gradual acquisition of 
      specific skills in the management of patients with CCHS and technological 
      improvements in mechanical ventilation allowed us to improve our therapeutic 
      approach in this population.

TI  - A respiratory/Hirschsprung phenotype in a three-generation family associated with 
      a novel pathogenic PHOX2B splice donor mutation.
PG  - e1528
LID - 10.1002/mgg3.1528 [doi]
LID - e1528
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mutations in the PHOX2B gene cause congenital central hypoventilation 
      syndrome (CCHS), a rare autonomic nervous system dysfunction disorder 
      characterized by a decreased ventilatory response to hypercapnia. Affected 
      subjects develop alveolar hypoventilation requiring ventilatory support 
      particularly during the non-REM phase of sleep. In more severe cases, 
      hypoventilation may extend into wakefulness. CCHS is associated with disorders 
      characterized by the defective migration/differentiation of neural crest 
      derivatives, including aganglionic megacolon or milder gastrointestinal 
      phenotypes, such as constipation. Most cases of CCHS are de novo, caused by 
      heterozygosity for polyalanine repeat expansion mutations (PARMs) in exon 3. 
      About 10% of cases are due to heterozygous non-PARM missense, nonsense or 
      frameshift mutations. METHODS: We describe a three-generation Maltese-Caucasian 
      family with a variable respiratory/Hirschsprung phenotype, characterized by 
      chronic constipation, three siblings with Hirschsprung disease necessitating 
      surgery, chronic hypoxia, and alveolar hypoventilation requiring non-invasive 
      ventilation. RESULTS: The sequencing of PHOX2B revealed a novel heterozygous 
      c.241+2delT splice variant in exon 1 that segregates with the CCHS/Hirschsprung 
      phenotype in the family. The mutation generates a non-functional splice site with 
      a deleterious effect on protein structure and is pathogenic according to ACMG P 
      VS1, PM2, and PP1 criteria. CONCLUSION: This report is significant as no PHOX2B 
      splice-site mutations have been reported. Additionally, it highlights the 
      variability in clinical expression and disease severity of non-PARM mutations.

AB  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare life-threatening 
      condition affecting the autonomic nervous system that usually presents shortly 
      after birth as hypoventilation or central apnea during sleep. In the majority of 
      cases, heterozygous polyalanine expansion mutations within the third exon of the 
      paired-like homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) gene underlie CCHS. Here, we report the 
      generation of two induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from two identical 
      twins with a heterozygous PHOX2B expansion mutation (+5 alanine residues). Both 
      generated lines highly express pluripotency markers, can differentiate into the 
      three germ layers, retain the disease-causing mutation and display normal 
      karyotypes.

AB  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) patients are at risk for 
      life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, and presentation is dependent on their 
      PHOX2B gene mutation. We describe the presentation of life-threatening 
      arrhythmias in our cohort of CCHS patients. We reviewed the records of 72 CCHS 
      patients seen at CHLA from 2004 to 2018. Data collected included demographics, 
      PHOX2B genotype, ventilatory support, clinical symptoms, ambulatory cardiac 
      monitoring results, and presence of cardiac pacemaker. Sixteen of 72 patients had 
      evidence of potential life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. PHOX2B genotypes were 
      20/25 polyalanine repeat expansion mutation (PARM), 20/26 PARM, 20/27 PARM, 20/32 
      PARM, and c.245C > T non-polyalanine repeat mutation. 11/16 patients were 
      ventilated during sleep only. Symptoms included syncope, dizziness, chest pain, 
      tingling in the left arm, and palpitations. 15/16 patients had recorded 
      ambulatory cardiac monitoring. 5/16 patients were symptomatic without significant 
      sinus pauses. 12/16 patients had implantation of cardiac pacemakers. 9/12 had 
      significant sinus pauses on ambulatory monitoring, and 7/12 patients were 
      symptomatic.Conclusion: CCHS patients have potential life-threatening arrhythmias 
      requiring cardiac pacemaker implantation. Many of these patients are symptomatic 
      with significant sinus pauses on ambulatory monitoring. However, some symptomatic 
      patients with no significant pauses on ambulatory monitoring may still require 
      cardiac pacemaker implantation.What is Known:* CCHS patients are at risk for 
      life-threatening sinus pauses and require cardiac pacemaker implantation.What is 
      New:* CCHS patients regardless of PHOX2B genotype are at risk for significant 
      sinus pauses. Many CCHS patients with significant sinus pause on ambulatory 
      cardiac monitoring are symptomatic and most present with syncope. Some 
      symptomatic patients do not have significant sinus pauses but may still require 
      cardiac pacemaker implantation.

TI  - Novel PHOX2B mutations in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome.
PG  - 393-396
LID - 10.1111/ped.13812 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is caused by 
      mutation of paird-like homeobox 2B (PHOX2B). Approximately 90% of patients were 
      found to carry polyalanine repeat expansion mutation (PARM), and the remaining 
      10% had non-PARM (NPARM). In PARM, the length of the polyalanine expansion 
      correlates with clinical disease severity. Most patients with NPARM have 
      hypoventilation symptoms in the neonatal period and complications of Hirschsprung 
      disease, dysregulation of autonomic nervous system, and tumors of neural crest 
      origin. Data on the genotype-phenotype association may contribute to the clinical 
      management of the disease. METHODS: We studied the genetic background of Japanese 
      CCHS patients according to PHOX2B sequencing. RESULTS: Of 133 Japanese CCHS 
      patients we identified 12 patients carrying 11 different NPARM (approx. 9% of the 
      patients) and described the clinical manifestations in seven of them with the 
      following novel mutations: c.941-945del5, c.678_693dup16, c.609_616del8, 
      c.620_633del14, c.663_711del 49, c.448C>G and c.944G>C. All patients had 
      hypoventilation in the neonatal period and also had Hirschsprung disease, with 
      the exception of two patients carrying c.620_633del14 and c.663_711del49 
      mutations. The patient carrying the c.609_616del8 mutation also had a benign 
      mediastinal tumor. CONCLUSION: Most patients carrying NPARM had severe symptoms 
      with frequent complications, as in previous reports, and should be carefully 
      monitored for various complications, including neural crest-derived tumor.

AB  - Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) is a rare disease 
      characterized by autonomic nervous system dysregulation. Central hypoventilation 
      is the most prominent and clinically important presentation. CCHS is caused by 
      mutations in paired-like homeobox 2b (PHOX2B) and is inherited in an autosomal 
      dominant pattern. A co-occurrence of two asymptomatic PHOX2B variants with a 
      classical CCHS presentation highlights the importance of clinical PHOX2B testing 
      in parents and family members of all CCHS probands. Despite being an autosomal 
      dominant disease, once a polyalanine repeat expansion mutation has been 
      identified, sequencing of the other allele should also be considered.

AB  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome is a disorder of respiratory control 
      caused by mutations in the paired-like homeobox 2B gene. Mutations in the 
      paired-like homeobox 2B gene are also responsible for Hirschsprung's disease. 
      Variant Hirschsprung's disease is a rarer disorder that does not meet the 
      diagnostic criteria of Hirschsprung's disease, although severe functional bowel 
      obstruction persists. We present a case of an extremely low birth weight infant 
      with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome and variant Hirschsprung's 
      disease. A male infant who was diagnosed to have fetal growth restriction and 
      polyhydramnios was delivered by emergency cesarean section at 30 weeks and 3 days 
      of gestational age due to non-reassuring fetal status. The birth weight was 
      979...g, and intensive care was started immediately following delivery. The patient 
      exhibited refractory apnea and was diagnosed with congenital central 
      hypoventilation syndrome by genetic testing of the paired-like homeobox 2B gene. 
      The patient also exhibited refractory functional bowel obstruction and was 
      diagnosed to have variant Hirschsprung's disease through pathological examination 
      of his intestinal specimens. The patient grew slowly but surely with intensive 
      care including mechanical ventilation and parenteral nutrition. However, the 
      patient repeatedly suffered from sepsis and died of fungemia at 197 days of age. 
      This is the first congenital central hypoventilation syndrome case that was 
      accompanied with variant Hirschsprung's disease, and the paired-like homeobox 2B 
      mutation detected in this case (NM_003924.3: c.441G...>...C; p.(Gln147His)) is novel. 
      This case suggests that the paired-like homeobox 2B mutation causes not only 
      congenital central hypoventilation syndrome and Hirschsprung's disease, but also 
      variant Hirschsprung's disease in humans. It also highlights the extreme 
      difficulty in treating premature infants with severe and prolonged functional 
      bowel obstruction.

AB  - Neural crest-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained from dental tissues 
      received considerable interest in regenerative medicine, particularly in nerve 
      regeneration owing to their embryonic origin and ease of harvest. Proliferation 
      efficacy and differentiation capacity into diverse cell lineages propose dental 
      MSCs as an in vitro tool for disease modeling. In this study, we investigated the 
      spontaneous differentiation efficiency of dental MSCs obtained from human gingiva 
      tissue (hGMSCs) into neural progenitor cells after extended passaging. At passage 
      41, the morphology of hGMSCs changed from typical fibroblast-like shape into 
      sphere-shaped cells with extending processes. Next-generation transcriptomics 
      sequencing showed increased expression of neural progenitor markers such as NES, 
      MEIS2, and MEST. In addition, de novo expression of neural precursor genes, such 
      as NRN1, PHOX2B, VANGL2, and NTRK3, was noticed in passage 41. 
      Immunocytochemistry results showed suppression of neurogenesis repressors TP53 
      and p21, whereas Western blot results revealed the expression of neurotrophic 
      factors BDNF and NT3 at passage 41. Our results showed the spontaneous efficacy 
      of hGMSCs to differentiate into neural precursor cells over prolonged passages 
      and that these cells may assist in producing novel in vitro disease models that 
      are associated with neural development.

AB  - Pathogenic variants in Paired-Like Homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) gene cause congenital 
      central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), a rare disorder of the nervous system 
      characterized by absent or reduced ventilatory response to hypoxia and 
      hypercapnia. The focus of management in CCHS is optimizing ventilation. Thus far, 
      no medication has proved effective in improving ventilation. Most CCHS cases are 
      caused by polyalanine repeat expansion mutations. Non-polyalanine repeat 
      expansion mutations are the cause in 8% of cases and result in a more severe 
      clinical presentation. PHOX2B has 3 exons. Exon 3 of PHOX2B is the most common 
      location for CCHS-causing mutations. Thus far, only 9 CCHS-causing mutations have 
      been reported in exon 1, 8 of which were nonsense mutations. We report a child 
      with CCHS who was found to have a novel heterozygous missense variant in exon 1; 
      c.95A > T. Improvement in his apneic episodes was observed following treatment 
      with carbamazepine.

TI  - Significant phenotype variability of congenital central hypoventilation syndrome 
      in a family with polyalanine expansion mutation of the PHOX2B gene.
PG  - 495-498
LID - 10.5507/bp.2016.038 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare genetic 
      disorder resulting from mutations in the PHOX2B gene located on chromosome 
      4p12.3, characterized by hypoventilation secondary to missing responses to both 
      hypercapnia and hypoxia. CASE REPORT: Proband. A girl, hospitalised 5 times for 
      respiratory failure from 6 weeks old, presented at 4 years of age severe cyanosis 
      related to pneumonia. Tracheostomy was done, and she was discharged home using a 
      portable positive pressure ventilator during sleep. Proband's father: The father 
      was retrospectively found out to suffer from severe headache and excessive 
      daytime sleepiness. Molecular genetic evaluation of PHOX2B gene was performed and 
      casual polyalanine repeat expansion mutation c.741_755dup15 in exon 3 was found 
      both in proband and her father in heterozygous form. The proband's grandmother 
      died of respiratory failure after administration of benzodiazepine at the age of 
      fifty years. Considering the grandmother's history, she is highly suspected of 
      having had CCHS as well. CONCLUSION: Repeated respiratory failure of girl was 
      explained by PHOX2B mutation and Ondina curse. Proband s father has incompletely 
      penetrated PHOX2B heterozygous mutation as well and proband s grandmother died 
      probably from the consequences of drug interaction with PHOX2B mutated background 
      as well. Both daughter and father currently require overnight mechanical 
      ventilatory support. Although most PHOX2B mutations occur de novo, our case is a 
      rare three generation family affected by autosomal dominant inheritance with 
      incomplete penetrance manifested as the late-form of CCHS and proven PHOX2B 
      mutation in two generations.

LID - 10.1074/jbc.M115.679027 [doi]
AB  - Heterozygous mutations of the human PHOX2B gene, a key regulator of autonomic 
      nervous system development, lead to congenital central hypoventilation syndrome 
      (CCHS), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a failure in the autonomic 
      control of breathing. Polyalanine expansions in the 20-residues region of the C 
      terminus of PHOX2B are the major mutations responsible for CCHS. Elongation of 
      the alanine stretch in PHOX2B leads to a protein with altered DNA binding, 
      transcriptional activity, and nuclear localization and the possible formation of 
      cytoplasmic aggregates; furthermore, the findings of various studies support the 
      idea that CCHS is not due to a pure loss of function mechanism but also involves 
      a dominant negative effect and/or toxic gain of function for PHOX2B mutations. 
      Because PHOX2B forms homodimers and heterodimers with its paralogue PHOX2A in 
      vitro, we tested the hypothesis that the dominant negative effects of the mutated 
      proteins are due to non-functional interactions with the wild-type protein or 
      PHOX2A using a co-immunoprecipitation assay and the mammalian two-hybrid system. 
      Our findings show that PHOX2B forms homodimers and heterodimerizes weakly with 
      mutated proteins, exclude the direct involvement of the polyalanine tract in 
      dimer formation, and indicate that mutated proteins retain partial ability to 
      form heterodimers with PHOX2A. Moreover, in this study, we investigated the 
      effects of the longest polyalanine expansions on the homeodomain-mediated nuclear 
      import, and our data clearly show that the expanded C terminus interferes with 
      this process. These results provide novel insights into the effects of the 
      alanine tract expansion on PHOX2B folding and activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) is a rare 
      neurocristopathy characterized by severe hypoventilation and autonomic 
      dysregulation, with typical presentation in the neonatal period, and deficient 
      cognitive skills in school-aged patients. We hypothesized that younger 
      (preschool) children with CCHS would also show neurocognitive delay and that 
      CCHS-related physiologic factors would impact neurocognitive test results. 
      METHODS: We studied developmental (Bayley) test results collected during routine 
      clinical care in 31 children (mean age 25.0 +/- 8.5 months; range, 6-40 months) 
      with PHOX2B mutation-confirmed CCHS by comparing them with the normative 
      reference mean from the Bayley standardization sample; we also examined 
      associations between Bayley scores and CCHS disease-related factors. RESULTS: 
      Preschool patients with CCHS fell significantly below the normative mean of 100 
      on Bayley indices of mental (mean, 83.35 +/- 24.75) and motor (mean, 73.33 +/- 20.48) 
      development (P < .001 for both). Significantly lower Bayley mental and motor 
      scores were associated with severe breath-holding spells, prolonged sinus pauses, 
      and need for 24 h/d artificial ventilation. Lower Bayley motor scores were also 
      associated with seizures. Bayley scores differed among children with the three 
      most common polyalanine repeat expansion mutation genotypes (mental, P = .001; 
      motor, P = .006), being essentially normal in children with the 20/25 genotype 
      but significantly lower in the other genotype groups (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: 
      These results confirm neurodevelopmental impairment of CCHS preschoolers, with 
      severity related to physiologic compromise and PHOX2B genotype. These findings 
      suggest that adverse effects begin early in the disease process, supporting the 
      need for neurodevelopmental monitoring and intervention from early infancy.

TI  - Oncologic Phenotype of Peripheral Neuroblastic Tumors Associated With PHOX2B 
      Non-Polyalanine Repeat Expansion Mutations.
PG  - 71-7
LID - 10.1002/pbc.25723 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Germline non-polyalanine repeat expansion mutations in PHOX2B (PHOX2B 
      NPARM) predispose to peripheral neuroblastic tumors (PNT), frequently in 
      association with other neurocristopathies: Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) or 
      congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). Although PHOX2B polyalanine 
      repeat expansions predispose to a low incidence of benign PNTs, the oncologic 
      phenotype associated with PHOX2B NPARM is still not known in detail. METHODS: We 
      analyzed prognostic factors, treatment toxicity, and outcome of patients with PNT 
      and PHOX2B NPARM. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were identified, six of whom also 
      had CCHS and/or HSCR, one also had late-onset hypoventilation with hypothalamic 
      dysfunction (LO-CHS/HD), and six had no other neurocristopathy. Four tumours were 
      "poorly differentiated," and nine were differentiated, including five 
      ganglioneuromas, three ganglioneuroblastomas, and one differentiating 
      neuroblastoma, hence illustrating that PHOX2B NPARM are predominantly associated 
      with differentiating tumors. Nevertheless, three patients had stage 4 and one 
      patient had stage 3 disease. Segmental chromosomal alterations, correlating with 
      poor prognosis, were found in all the six tumors analyzed by array-comparative 
      genomic hybridization. One patient died of tumor progression, one is on 
      palliative care, one died of hypoventilation, and 10 patients are still alive, 
      with median follow-up of 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Based on histological phenotype, 
      our series suggests that heterozygous PHOX2B NPARM do not fully preclude ganglion 
      cell differentiation in tumors. However, this tumor predisposition syndrome may 
      also be associated with poorly differentiated tumors with unfavorable genomic 
      profiles and clinically aggressive behaviors. The intrafamilial variability and

AB  - Examine the genotype-phenotype relationship in Japanese congenital central 
      hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) patients and estimate the incidence of CCHS in 
      Japan. Subjects were 92 Japanese patients with PHOX2B mutations; 19 cases carried 
      25 polyalanine repeat expansion mutations (PARMs); 67 cases carried 26 or more 
      PARMs; and 6 had non-PARMs (NPARMs). We collected clinical data in all patients 
      and estimated the development or intelligent quotients only in the patients 
      carrying 25 PARM. The estimated incidence of CCHS was greater than one case per 
      148 000 births. Polyhydramnios was observed in three cases. Twelve infants 
      exhibited depressed respiration at birth. In 19 cases carrying 25 PARM, the 
      male-to-female ratio was ~3, no cases had Hirschsprung disease; 7 cases (37%) 
      developed hypoventilation after the neonatal period, and 8 cases (42%) had mental 
      retardation. In other 73 cases carrying 26 or more PARMs or NPARMs, 
      male-to-female ratio was equal; patients frequently complicated with Hirschsprung 
      disease and constipation, and all patients presented with hypoventilation in the 
      neonatal period. Clinical symptoms were severe in most patients carrying long 
      PARMs and NPARMs. In 25 PARM, additional genetic and/or epigenetic factors were 
      required for CCHS development and male sex is likely a predisposing factor. The 
      patients carrying 25 PARM frequently had mental retardation likely because they 
      were not able to receive appropriate ventilation support following a definitive 
      diagnosis owing to subtle and or irregular hypoventilation. Molecular diagnosis 
      provides a definitive diagnosis and enables to receive appropriate ventilator 
      support.

TI  - Treatment of neuroblastoma in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome with a

      syndrome.
PG  - 2007-10
LID - 10.1002/pbc.25572 [doi]
AB  - Neuroblastoma in patients with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) 
      as part of a neurocristopathy syndrome is a rare finding and has only been 
      associated with paired-like homeobox 2b (PHOX2B) non-polyalanine-repeat-expansion 
      mutations. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of a child with 
      CCHS and Hirschsprung disease who had a PHOX2B polyalanine-repeat-expansion 
      mutation (PARM) (genotype 20/33) and developed high-risk neuroblastoma. We 
      further describe his treatment including chemotherapy and therapeutic I(131) 
      -metaiodobenzylguanidine. This case highlights the need to consider neuroblastoma 
      in patients with CCHS and the longest PHOX2B PARMs and to individualize treatment 
      based on co-morbidities.

PG  - 171-83
LID - 10.1007/s00401-015-1441-0 [doi]
AB  - Human congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), resulting from 
      mutations in transcription factor PHOX2B, manifests with impaired responses to 
      hypoxemia and hypercapnia especially during sleep. To identify brainstem 
      structures developmentally affected in CCHS, we analyzed two postmortem 
      neonatal-lethal cases with confirmed polyalanine repeat expansion (PARM) or 
      Non-PARM (PHOX2B...8) mutation of PHOX2B. Both human cases showed neuronal losses 
      within the locus coeruleus (LC), which is important for central noradrenergic 
      signaling. Using a conditionally active transgenic mouse model of the PHOX2B...8 
      mutation, we found that early embryonic expression (<E10.5) caused failure of LC 
      neuronal specification and perinatal respiratory lethality. In contrast, later 
      onset (E11.5) of PHOX2B...8 expression was not deleterious to LC development and 
      perinatal respiratory lethality was rescued, despite failure of chemosensor 
      retrotrapezoid nucleus formation. Our findings indicate that early-onset mutant 
      PHOX2B expression inhibits LC neuronal development in CCHS. They further suggest 
      that such mutations result in dysregulation of central noradrenergic signaling, 
      and therefore, potential for early pharmacologic intervention in humans with 
      CCHS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the contribution of sequence variations in PHOX2B to 
      sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). METHODS: Patients who died of SUDEP 
      were identified in 2 major Australian cohorts, the Epilepsy Genetics research 
      program in Melbourne and postmortem cases at the Department of Forensic Medicine 
      in Sydney. Coding exons of the PHOX2B gene were sequenced and a fluorescent 
      sizing assay was used to measure the PHOX2B polyalanine repeat sequence. RESULTS: 
      Sequencing of 68 cases of SUDEP identified a 15-nucleotide deletion in the PHOX2B 
      polyalanine repeat region in one case, a 16-year-old adolescent with focal 
      dyscognitive seizures from age 5 years. This deletion was verified using a 
      fluorescent sizing assay. Two synonymous variants were identified in 4 cases, but 
      no PHOX2B polyalanine repeat expansion alleles or point mutations were found. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The absence of PHOX2B polyalanine repeat expansion alleles or point 
      mutations in 68 Australian cases of SUDEP, with one deletion of uncertain 
      significance, shows that PHOX2B mutations are not a common risk factor for SUDEP.

TI  - PHOX2B polyalanine repeat length is associated with sudden infant death syndrome 
      and unclassified sudden infant death in the Dutch population.
PG  - 621-9

AB  - Unclassified sudden infant death (USID) is the sudden and unexpected death of an 
      infant that remains unexplained after thorough case investigation including 
      performance of a complete autopsy and review of the circumstances of death and 
      the clinical history. When the infant is below 1 year of age and with onset of 
      the fatal episode apparently occurring during sleep, this is referred to as 
      sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). USID and SIDS remain poorly understood 
      despite the identification of several environmental and some genetic risk 
      factors. In this study, we investigated genetic risk factors involved in the 
      autonomous nervous system in 195 Dutch USID/SIDS cases and 846 Dutch, age-matched 
      healthy controls. Twenty-five DNA variants from 11 genes previously implicated in 
      the serotonin household or in the congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, of 
      which some have been associated with SIDS before, were tested. Of all DNA 
      variants considered, only the length variation of the polyalanine repeat in exon 
      3 of the PHOX2B gene was found to be statistically significantly associated with 
      USID/SIDS in the Dutch population after multiple test correction. Interestingly, 
      our data suggest that contraction of the PHOX2B exon 3 polyalanine repeat that we 
      found in six of 160 SIDS and USID cases and in six of 814 controls serves as a 
      probable genetic risk factor for USID/SIDS at least in the Dutch population. 
      Future studies are needed to confirm this finding and to understand the 
      functional effect of the polyalanine repeat length variation, in particular 
      contraction, in exon 3 of the PHOX2B gene.

AB  - Co-occurrence of congenital central hypoventilation syndrome and Hirschsprung 
      disease is known as Haddad syndrome. Affected patients develop with variable 
      expressivity a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. We report the natural 
      history of a full-term newborn infant presenting multiple features of autonomic 
      system dysfunction that were already noted antenatally. The presence of a 
      nonpolyalanine repeat expansion mutation in the PHOX2B gene confirmed postnatally 
      the diagnosis of Haddad syndrome. This case suggests that patients presenting 
      with autonomic system dysfunction may already present signs of the disease during 
      the fetal period. Furthermore, antenatal presentations may correlate with a more 
      severe presentation of the disease. In conclusion, antenatal signs of dysautonomy 
      should stimulate multidisciplinary prenatal approach to orientate proper 
      postnatal intervention and facilitate treatment strategies.

AB  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is an uncommon genetic 
      disorder that is characterized by alveolar hypoventilation and autonomic 
      dysregulation. More than 90% of the patients are heterozygous for polyalanine 
      repeat expansion mutations in the paired-like homeobox 2b (PHOX2B) gene. The 
      normal genotype has a 20-polyalanine sequence whereas expanded alleles are 
      usually 25-33. Heterozygous 24-polyalanine repeat expansion mutation in the 
      PHOX2B gene has rarely been reported. We report three consecutive generations 
      harboring heterozygous 24-polyalanine repeats in the PHOX2B gene with 
      manifestations ranging from apparently asymptomatic to alveolar hypoventilation 
      and apnea requiring mechanical ventilation. The 3-year-old proband developed cor 
      pulmonale and central hypoventilation following an upper respiratory tract 
      infection. Our findings add to the accumulating evidence that the 24-polyalanine 
      repeat in the PHOX2B is a disease-causing mutation. In addition, a high index of 
      suspicion and careful monitoring after anesthesia, sedation, or respiratory 
      illnesses should be exercised when evaluating asymptomatic family members with 
      this genotype.

AB  - The PHOX2B transcription factor plays a crucial role in autonomic nervous system 
      development. In humans, heterozygous mutations of the PHOX2B gene lead to 
      congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), a rare disorder characterized 
      by a broad variety of symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction including 
      inadequate control of breathing. The vast majority of patients with CCHS are 
      heterozygous for a polyalanine repeat expansion mutation involving a polyalanine 
      tract of twenty residues in the C-terminus of PHOX2B. Although several lines of 
      evidence support a dominant-negative mechanism for PHOX2B mutations in CCHS, the 
      molecular effects of PHOX2B mutant proteins on the transcriptional activity of 
      the wild-type protein have not yet been elucidated. As one of the targets of 
      PHOX2B is the PHOX2B gene itself, we tested the transcriptional activity of 
      wild-type and mutant proteins on the PHOX2B gene promoter, and found that the 
      transactivation ability of proteins with polyalanine expansions decreased as a 
      function of the length of the expansion, whereas DNA binding was severely 
      affected only in the case of the mutant with the longest polyalanine tract (+13 
      alanine). Co-transfection experiments using equimolar amounts of PHOX2B wild-type 
      and mutant proteins in order to simulate a heterozygous state in vitro and four 
      different PHOX2B target gene regulatory regions (PHOX2B, PHOX2A, DBH, TLX2) 
      clearly showed that the polyalanine expanded proteins alter the transcriptional 
      activity of wild-type protein in a promoter-specific manner, without any clear 
      correlation with the length of the expansion. Moreover, although reduced 
      transactivation may be caused by retention of the wild-type protein in the 
      cytoplasm or in nuclear aggregates, this mechanism can only be partially 
      responsible for the pathogenesis of CCHS because of the reduction in cytoplasmic 
      and nuclear accumulation when the +13 alanine mutant is co-expressed with 
      wild-type protein, and the fact that the shortest polyalanine expansions do not 
      form visible cytoplasmic aggregates. Deletion of the C-terminal of PHOX2B leads 
      to a protein that correctly localizes in the nucleus but impairs PHOX2B wild-type 
      transcriptional activity, thus suggesting that protein mislocalization is not the 
      only mechanism leading to CCHS. The results of this study provide novel in vitro 
      experimental evidence of a transcriptional dominant-negative effect of PHOX2B 
      polyalanine mutant proteins on wild-type protein on two different PHOX2B target 
      genes.

AB  - Down syndrome (DS) is recognized by characteristic facial features, intellectual 
      disability, and an increased risk for cardiac malformations and duodenal atresia. 
      Recently, Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), or congenital aganglionic megacolon, has 
      been seen more often among patients with DS. Given the systemic nature of 
      DS-related features, it is natural to attribute neonatal complications to the 
      chromosomal aberration. We describe a biracial male infant with DS who had 
      significantly delayed defecation and required continuous ventilator support, but 
      had no primary cardiac or lung disease. Subsequent evaluations confirmed total 
      colonic aganglionosis. Because we were unable to safely extubate the infant, a 
      diagnosis of congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) was considered 
      and confirmed by molecular analysis of the PHOX2B gene, revealing a heterozygous 
      polyalanine repeat-expansion mutation containing 27 repeats (normal gene contains 
      20 repeats). HSCR coexisting with CCHS is known as Haddad syndrome. This is the 
      first reported case with co-occurrence of DS, CCHS, and HSCR.

      expression.
PG  - 3145-58
LID - 63401 [pii]
LID - 10.1172/JCI63401 [doi]
AB  - The most common forms of neurocristopathy in the autonomic nervous system are 
      Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), resulting in congenital loss of enteric ganglia, and 
      neuroblastoma (NB), childhood tumors originating from the sympathetic ganglia and 
      adrenal medulla. The risk for these diseases dramatically increases in patients 
      with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) harboring a 
      nonpolyalanine repeat expansion mutation of the Paired-like homeobox 2b (PHOX2B) 
      gene, but the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis remains unknown. We found that 
      introducing nonpolyalanine repeat expansion mutation of the PHOX2B into the mouse 
      Phox2b locus recapitulates the clinical features of the CCHS associated with HSCR 
      and NB. In mutant embryos, enteric and sympathetic ganglion progenitors showed 
      sustained sex-determining region Y (SRY) box10 (Sox10) expression, with impaired 
      proliferation and biased differentiation toward the glial lineage. Nonpolyalanine 
      repeat expansion mutation of PHOX2B reduced transactivation of wild-type PHOX2B 
      on its known target, dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), in a dominant-negative 
      fashion. Moreover, the introduced mutation converted the transcriptional effect 
      of PHOX2B on a Sox10 enhancer from repression to transactivation. Collectively, 
      these data reveal that nonpolyalanine repeat expansion mutation of PHOX2B is both 
      a dominant-negative and gain-of-function mutation. Our results also demonstrate 
      that Sox10 regulation by PHOX2B is pivotal for the development and pathogenesis 
      of the autonomic ganglia.

      authors report a 37- d-old girl infant with recurrent apnea requiring repeated 
      mechanical ventilation with no evidence of neuromuscular, cardiac or lung 
      disease. A mutation analysis of PHOX2B gene revealed 25 polyalanine repeat

      among pediatricians about molecular basis and availability of confirmatory 
      genetic testing for diagnosis and to help with prognosis in this disorder.

TI  - Germline mosaicism of PHOX2B mutation accounts for familial recurrence of 
      congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS).
PG  - 2297-301
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.35499 [doi]
AB  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), a rare disorder characterized 
      by alveolar hypoventilation and autonomic dysregulation, is caused by mutations 
      in the PHOX2B gene. Most mutations occur de novo, but recent evidence suggests 
      that up to 25% are inherited from asymptomatic parents with somatic mosaicism for 
      these mutations. However, to date, germline mosaicism has not been reported. This 
      report describes a family with recurrence of PHOX2B mutation-confirmed CCHS due 
      to germline mosaicism. The first occurrence was a baby girl, noted on day 2 of 
      life to have multiple episodes of apnea, bradycardia, and cyanosis while 
      breathing room air. PHOX2B gene testing confirmed the diagnosis of CCHS with a 
      heterozygous polyalanine repeat expansion mutation (PARM); genotype 20/27 (normal 
      20/20). Both parents tested negative for this mutation using fragment analysis 
      (limit of detection<1%). Upon subsequent pregnancy [paternity confirmed using 
      short tandem repeat (STR) analysis], amniocentesis testing identified the PHOX2B 
      20/27 genotype, confirmed with repeat testing. Elective abortion was performed at 
      21.5 weeks gestation. Testing of abortus tissue confirmed amniocentesis testing. 
      The PHOX2B 20/27 expansion was not observed in a paternal sperm sample. This case 
      represents the first reported family with recurrence of PHOX2B mutation-confirmed 
      CCHS without detection of a parental carrier state or mosaicism, confirming the 
      previously hypothesized possibility of germline mosaicism for PHOX2B mutations. 
      This is an important finding for genetic counseling of CCHS families, suggesting 
      that even if somatic mosaicism is not detected in parental samples, there is 
      still reason for careful genetic counseling and consideration of prenatal testing 
      during subsequent pregnancies.

LID - 10.1038/jhg.2012.27 [doi]
AB  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS; MIM 209880) is caused mostly 
      by dominant alanine expansion (most prevalent is 7-alanine expansion) mutations 
      in PHOX2B. More than 90% of the alanine expansion mutations had been considered 
      to be de novo due to unequal crossover during gametogenesis. However, a recent 
      report stated that 25% of patients inherited the alanine-expanded allele from 
      their parents with somatic mosaicism or constitutive mutation. We studied 
      inheritance in 45 unrelated families, and found that one patient (2%) inherited 
      5-alanine expansion mutation from a parent with late-onset central 
      hypoventilation syndrome and nine patients (20%) inherited 5- to 7-alanine 
      expansion mutation from apparently asymptomatic parents with somatic mosaicism. 
      Analysis using a sensitive method would be recommended to all parents of CCHS 
      proband due to high incidence of somatic mosaicism. The absence of an 
      alanine-contracted allele (expected counterpart allele in unequal crossover) and 
      the highest prevalence of 6-alanine expansion mutation in somatic mosaicism 
      suggest that the somatic mosaicism is likely caused by a mechanism other than an 
      unequal crossover, such as a replication mechanism.

PG  - 280-5
LID - 10.1038/pr.2011.38 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is characterized 
      by alveolar hypoventilation, autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation (ANSD), 
      and mutations in the paired-like homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) gene. ANSD in CCHS affects 
      multiple systems and includes ophthalmologic abnormalities. We hypothesized that 
      quantitative pupil measures, obtained using pupillometry, would vary between 
      cases with CCHS and controls and within those with CCHS by PHOX2B genotype. 
      RESULTS: Measures known to be illustrative of sympathetic and parasympathetic 
      response (prestimulus, maximum pupil diameter, percentage of pupil constriction 
      after light stimulus, and average constriction and dilation velocities) were 
      significantly reduced in those with CCHS as compared with controls (all P < 
      0.05). DISCUSSION: These reductions are indicative of both sympathetic and 
      parasympathetic deficits in CCHS, which is in keeping with the role of PHOX2B in 
      ANS development. An inverse linear relationship was apparent in pupil diameter 
      and velocity measurements among the cases with CCHS with the most common 
      heterozygous PHOX2B polyalanine expansion repeat mutations, suggesting a graded 
      phenotype/genotype dose response based on polyalanine repeat length. These 
      results confirm our central hypotheses while offering the first objective 
      measures of pupillary dysfunction and ophthalmologic-specific ANSD in CCHS. 
      METHODS: A total of 316 monocular measurements were taken under dark-adapted 
      conditions with a fixed light stimulus from 22 PHOX2B mutation-confirmed cases 
      with CCHS and 68 healthy controls.

TI  - PHOX2B mutations in patients with Ondine-Hirschsprung disease and a review of the 
      literature.
PG  - 1267-71
LID - 10.1007/s00431-011-1434-5 [doi]
AB  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), also known as Ondine's curse, 
      is characterized by idiopathic failure of autonomic breathing and is often 
      associated with neurocristopathies such as Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). CCHS is 
      caused by mutations in the paired-like homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) gene, often manifest 
      as polyalanine repeat expansions. Herein, we report the cases of two unrelated 
      Korean patients with Ondine-Hirschsprung disease. The patient's clinical 
      manifestations were apnea and cyanosis requiring immediate endotracheal 
      intubation, recurrent hypoventilation with hypercapnia, hypoxia after ventilator 
      removal, and abdominal distension since birth. Intestinal biopsies were performed 
      and the absence of ganglion cells in the colon was consistent with HSCR. We 
      performed direct sequencing analysis in the PHOX2B and RET genes and fluorescence 
      polymerase chain reaction in order to determine the polyalanine tract expansion 
      in exon 3 of the PHOX2B gene. Expansion mutations were detected in both patients; 
      one had 20/24 repeats and the other had 20/27 repeats. The 20/24 genotype has not 
      been previously described in severe CCHS phenotypes and associated HSCR. We 
      believe that the information in this report will improve our understanding of the 
      phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneities of CCHS and HSCR.

AB  - Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) is a rare genetic disorder. 
      Although most CCHS associated PHOX2B mutations occur de novo, about 10% of the 
      cases are inherited from apparently asymptomatic parents, thus confirming 
      variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance of PHOX2B mutations. Three 
      asymptomatic parents of children affected with CCHS, and found to carry the same 
      PHOX2B expansion mutations as their siblings, were studied by overnight 
      polysomnography and somatic mosaicism analysis. In one case, significant sleep 
      breathing control anomalies were detected, while the other two resulted in 
      normal. In tissue-specific allele studies, mosaicism with a comparatively low 
      mutant allele proportion was showed in the two unaffected adult carriers. 
      Accurate polysomnography and assessment of the degree of somatic mosaicism should 
      be conducted in asymptomatic carriers of PHOX2B mutations, as they may unmask 
      subclinical but significant anomalies.

TI  - Polyalanine expansion of PHOX2B in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome: 
      rs17884724:A>C is associated with 7-alanine expansion.
PG  - 4-7
LID - 10.1038/jhg.2009.109 [doi]
AB  - With congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), most patients have a de 
      novo 5-13 polyalanine expansion mutation in PHOX2B. We reported previously that 
      de novo polyalanine expansion mutations were of paternal origin and were derived 
      from unequal sister chromatid exchange during spermatogenesis in six and four 
      informative families, respectively. In this study, we analyzed the relationship 
      between haplotypes and de novo polyalanine expansion in PHOX2B and found that 
      haplotypes carrying rs17884724:A>C were detected frequently in 7-alanine expanded 
      (27-alanine) mutant alleles, which are the most prevalent mutations in CCHS. The 
      allele with rs17884724:A>C made fewer nucleotide mismatches in the misalignment 
      at crossing-over than the allele without rs17884724:A>C. The high frequency of 
      rs17884724:A>C in 7-alanine expansion (27-alanine) mutations also supported the 
      unequal crossover mechanism for polyalanine expansion. We also confirmed the 
      paternal origin of de novo polyalanine expansion mutation and unequal sister 
      chromatid exchange association in three more patients. In spite of paternal bias, 
      the paternal age effect on CCHS incidence was not observed. De novo polyalanine 
      expansion mutations are mainly derived from unequal sister chromatid exchange 
      during spermatogenesis because of replication and/or repair systems that are 
      specific for spermatogenesis.

TI  - MYCN promotes the expansion of Phox2B-positive neuronal progenitors to drive 
      neuroblastoma development.
PG  - 856-66
LID - 10.2353/ajpath.2009.090019 [doi]
AB  - Amplification of the oncogene MYCN is a tumorigenic event in the development of a 
      subset of neuroblastomas that commonly consist of undifferentiated or poorly 
      differentiated neuroblasts with unfavorable clinical outcome. The cellular origin 
      of these neuroblasts is unknown. Additionally, the cellular functions and target 
      cells of MYCN in neuroblastoma development remain undefined. Here we examine the 
      cell types that drive neuroblastoma development in TH-MYCN transgenic mice, an 
      animal model of the human disease. Neuroblastoma development in these mice begins 
      with hyperplastic lesions in early postnatal sympathetic ganglia. We show that 
      both hyperplasia and primary tumors are composed predominantly of highly 
      proliferative Phox2B(+) neuronal progenitors. MYCN induces the expansion of these 
      progenitors by both promoting their proliferation and preventing their 
      differentiation. We further identify a minor population of undifferentiated 
      nestin(+) cells in both hyperplastic lesions and primary tumors that may serve as 
      precursors of Phox2B(+) neuronal progenitors. These findings establish the 
      identity of neuroblasts that characterize the tumor phenotype and suggest a 
      cellular pathway by which MYCN can promote neuroblastoma development.

      heterozygous 24-polyalanine repeat expansion in the PHOX2B gene (20/24 genotype), 
      a genotype that has not been previously described in association with CCHS or 
      LO-CCHS symptoms. Clinical findings in members of the family with the same 20/24 
      genotype ranged from asymptomatic to prolonged sedation after benzodiazepines. 
      CONCLUSION: CCHS should be suspected in individuals presenting with unexplained 
      hypoventilation and/or seizures after anesthetics or sedatives. This is the first 
      report of LO-CCHS in a kindred with the PHOX2B 20/24 genotype. The incomplete 
      penetrance observed in this family suggests a gene-environment interaction.

TI  - Parental origin and somatic mosaicism of PHOX2B mutations in Congenital Central 
      Hypoventilation Syndrome.
PG  - 206
AB  - Heterozygous polyalanine repeat expansions of PHOX2B have been associated with 
      Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome, a rare neurocristopathy 
      characterized by absence of adequate control of respiration during sleep. Here we 
      report a PHOX2B mutational screening in 63 CCHS patients, 58 of whom presenting 
      with poly-A expansions or frameshift, missense and nonsense mutations. To assess 
      a somatic or germline occurrence of poly-A length variations, the relative 
      amounts of mutant and wild type alleles have been quantified in 20 selected CCHS 
      patients presenting with an expansion, and in their parents. Somatic mosaicism 
      was shown in four parents, while no mosaic was found among CCHS patients. 
      Moreover, while co-segregation analysis of the PHOX2B poly-A expansions with 
      selected marker alleles in the same 20 CCHS trios has not demonstrated any 
      parent-of-origin effect of the mutations, it has provided further clues to 
      clarify the molecular mechanism underlying the expansion occurrence. Finally, the 
      segregation of PHOX2B poly-A anomalous tracts within family members has allowed 
      us to exclude tendency of polymorphic variations towards expansion. This 
      strengthens the notion that expanded polyalanine tracts, identified as frequent 
      disease-causing mutations also in other human diseases, are mitotically and 
      meiotically stable.

TI  - De novo polyalanine expansion of PHOX2B in congenital central hypoventilation 
      syndrome: unequal sister chromatid exchange during paternal gametogenesis.
PG  - 921-925
LID - 10.1007/s10038-007-0197-3 [doi]
AB  - The expansion of polyalanine repeats is known to cause at least nine disorders, 
      including congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). Unequal crossover 
      has been speculated as the expanding mechanism, in contrast to strand slippage in 
      polyglutamine expansion disorders. We carried out segregation analysis of PHOX2B 
      in 13 de novo families with CCHS and found that 6 families were informative 
      regarding a parental origin of polyalanine expansion, with all 6 mutants being of 
      paternal origin. Four of them were also informative regarding a chromosomal event 
      and their mutants were derived from unequal sister chromatid exchange. It is 
      probable that de novo expansion of polyalanine repeats in CCHS results mainly 
      from unequal sister chromatid exchange during spermatogenesis due to the 
      secondary DNA structure of imperfect trinucleotide repeats encoding polyalanine 
      tracts.

TI  - Geldanamycin promotes nuclear localisation and clearance of PHOX2B misfolded 
      proteins containing polyalanine expansions.
PG  - 327-39
AB  - Polyalanine expansions in the PHOX2B gene have been detected in the vast majority 
      of patients affected with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, a 
      neurocristopathy characterized by absence of adequate control of breathing, 
      especially during sleep, with decreased sensitivity to hypoxia and hypercapnia. 
      The correlation between length of the alanine expanded tracts and severity of 
      congenital central hypoventilation syndrome respiratory phenotype has been 
      confirmed by length-dependent cytoplasmic PHOX2B retention with formation of 
      aggregates. To deepen into the molecular mechanisms mediating the effects of 
      PHOX2B polyalanine expansions, we have set up experiments aimed at assessing the 
      fate of cells characterized by PHOX2B polyalanine aggregates. In particular, we 
      have observed that activation of the heat shock response by the drug geldanamycin 
      is efficient both in preventing formation and in inducing clearance of PHOX2B 
      pre-formed polyalanine aggregates in COS-7 cells expressing PHOX2B-GFP fused 
      proteins, and ultimately also in rescuing the PHOX2B ability to transactivate the 
      Dopamine-beta-Hydroxilase promoter. In addition, we have demonstrated elimination 
      of PHOX2B mutant proteins by the proteasome and autophagy, two cellular 
      mechanisms already been involved in the clearance of proteins containing expanded 
      polyglutamine and polyalanine tracts. Moreover, our data suggest that 
      geldanamycin effects on PHOX2B aggregates may be also mediated by the proteasome 
      pathway. Finally, analysis of cellular toxicity due to polyalanine aggregates has 
      confirmed the occurrence of cell apoptosis consequent to expression of PHOX2B 
      carrying the longest expanded alanine tract and shown that geldanamycin can delay 
      cell progression toward the most advanced apoptotic stages.

TI  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome: PHOX2B mutations and phenotype.
PG  - 1139-44
AB  - RATIONALE: Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), a unique disorder 
      of respiratory control associated with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) and tumors of 
      neural crest origin, results from polyalanine repeat expansion mutations in the 
      paired-like homeobox (PHOX)2B gene in more than 90% of cases, and alternative 
      PHOX2B mutations in remaining cases. OBJECTIVES: To characterize CCHS-associated 
      nonpolyalanine repeat mutations in PHOX2B, evaluate genotype-phenotype 
      relationships, and compare clinical features of CCHS in cases with nonpolyalanine 
      repeat mutations to those with polyalanine expansion mutations. METHODS: DNA from 
      probands was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction for the common polyalanine 
      repeat expansion. If no expansion was present, coding regions and intron-exon 
      boundaries of PHOX2B were sequenced. When possible, parents and siblings were 
      screened for the mutation found in the proband. RESULTS: Fourteen nonpolyalanine 
      repeat mutations, including missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, and 170 
      polyalanine repeat mutations were identified in 184 CCHS probands. Both 
      incomplete penetrance and parental mosaicism were observed within the family 
      members of probands with nonpolyalanine repeat mutations. Increased prevalence of 
      continuous ventilatory dependence, HSCR, and neural crest tumors was seen in the 
      nonpolyalanine repeat group compared to those with polyalanine repeat mutations. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that nonpolyalanine repeat mutations produce more 
      severe disruption of PHOX2B function. Patients carrying these mutations should be 
      evaluated for HSCR and neural crest tumors. Because incomplete penetrance can 
      occur in families of CCHS probands with PHOX2B mutations, genetic screening of 
      appropriate family members is indicated to evaluate reproductive risk and because 
      asymptomatic mutation carriers may be at risk for developing alveolar 
      hypoventilation.

TI  - Sensitive detection of polyalanine expansions in PHOX2B by polymerase chain 
      reaction using bisulfite-converted DNA.
PG  - 638-40
AB  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, also known as Ondine's curse, is 
      characterized by idiopathic abnormal control of respiration during sleep. Recent 
      studies indicate that a polyalanine expansion of PHOX2B is relevant to the 
      pathogenesis of this disorder. However, it is difficult to detect the repeated 
      tract because its high GC content inhibits conventional polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) amplification. Here, we describe a bisulfite treatment for DNA in which 
      uracil is obtained by deamination of unmethylated cytosine residues. Deamination 
      of DNA permitted direct PCR amplification that yielded a product of 123 bp for 
      the common 20-residue repetitive tract with replacement of C with T by

      of expanded alleles. The defined procedure dramatically improved detection of 
      expansions to 9 of 10 congenital central hypoventilation syndrome patients 
      examined in a previous study. The chemical conversion of DNA before PCR 
      amplification facilitates effective detection of GC-rich polyalanine tracts.

TI  - Molecular consequences of PHOX2B missense, frameshift and alanine expansion 
      mutations leading to autonomic dysfunction.
PG  - 3697-708
AB  - Heterozygous mutations of the PHOX2B gene account for a broad variety of 
      disorders of the autonomic nervous system, either isolated or combined, including 
      congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), tumours of the sympathetic 
      nervous system and Hirschsprung disease. In CCHS, the prevalent mutation is an 
      expansion of a 20-alanine stretch ranging from +5 to +13 alanines, whereas 
      frameshift and missense mutations are found occasionally. To determine the 
      molecular basis of impaired PHOX2B function, we assayed the transactivation and 
      DNA binding properties of wild-type and mutant PHOX2B proteins. Furthermore, we 
      investigated aggregate formation by proteins with polyalanine tract expansions 
      ranging from +5 to +13 alanines using immunofluorescence of transfected cells and 
      gel filtration of in vitro translated proteins. We found that transactivation of 
      the dopamine beta-hydroxylase promoter by PHOX2B proteins with frameshift and 
      missense mutations was abolished or severely curtailed, as was in vitro DNA 
      binding although the proteins localized to the nucleus. The transactivation 
      potential of proteins with polyalanine tract expansions declined with increasing 
      length of the polyalanine stretch, and DNA binding was affected for an expansion 
      of +9 alanines and above. Cytoplasmic aggregation in transfected cells was only 
      observed for the longest expansions, whereas even the short expansion mutants 
      were prone to form multimers in vitro. Such a tendency to protein misfolding 
      could explain loss of transactivation for alanine expansion mutations. However, 
      additional mechanisms such as toxic gain-of-function may play a role in the 
      pathogenic process.

TI  - Distinct pathogenetic mechanisms for PHOX2B associated polyalanine expansions and 
      frameshift mutations in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome.
PG  - 1815-24
AB  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare neurocristopathy 
      characterized by absence of adequate autonomic control of respiration with 
      decreased sensitivity to hypoxia and hypercapnia. Frameshift mutations and 
      polyalanine triplet expansions in the coding region of PHOX2B have been 
      identified in the vast majority of CCHS patients and a correlation between length 
      of the expanded region and severity of CCHS has been reported. In this work, we 
      have undertaken in vitro analyses aimed at identifying the pathogenetic 
      mechanisms which underlie the effects of PHOX2B mutations in CCHS. According to 
      the known role of this gene, a transcription factor expressed during autonomic 
      nervous system development, we have tested the transcriptional activity of WT and 
      mutant PHOX2B expression constructs on the regulatory regions of two target 
      genes, DbetaH and PHOX2A. We observed that the two sets of mutations play 
      different roles in the transcriptional regulation of these genes, showing a 
      correlation between the length of polyalanine expansions and the severity of 
      reduced transcriptional activity. In particular, although reduced transactivation 
      due to polyalanine expansions may be caused by retention of the mutated protein 
      in the cytoplasm or in the nuclear aggregates, frameshift mutations did not 
      impair the PHOX2B nuclear income, suggesting a different mechanism through which 
      they would exert the observed effects on target promoters. Moreover, the 
      frameshift due to deletion of a cytosine residue seems to cause sequestration of 
      the corresponding mutant PHOX2B in the nucleolar compartment.

TI  - Polyalanine expansion and frameshift mutations of the paired-like homeobox gene 
      PHOX2B in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome.
PG  - 459-61
AB  - Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS or Ondine's curse; OMIM 209880) 
      is a life-threatening disorder involving an impaired ventilatory response to 
      hypercarbia and hypoxemia. This core phenotype is associated with 
      lower-penetrance anomalies of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) including 
      Hirschsprung disease and tumors of neural-crest derivatives such as 
      ganglioneuromas and neuroblastomas. In mice, the development of ANS reflex 
      circuits is dependent on the paired-like homeobox gene Phox2b. Thus, we regarded 
      its human ortholog, PHOX2B, as a candidate gene in CCHS. We found heterozygous de 
      novo mutations in PHOX2B in 18 of 29 individuals with CCHS. Most mutations 
      consisted of 5-9 alanine expansions within a 20-residue polyalanine tract 
      probably resulting from non-homologous recombination. We show that PHOX2B is 
      expressed in both the central and the peripheral ANS during human embryonic 
      development. Our data support an essential role of PHOX2B in the normal 
      patterning of the autonomous ventilation system and, more generally, of the ANS 
      in humans.
