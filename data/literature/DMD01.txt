AB  - BACKGROUND: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked disorder caused by 
      mutations in the DMD gene, with large deletions being the most common type of 
      mutation. Inversions involving the DMD gene are a less frequent cause of the 
      disorder, largely because they often evade detection by standard diagnostic 
      methods such as multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) and whole exome 
      sequencing (WES). CASE PRESENTATION: Our research identified two intrachromosomal 
      inversions involving the dystrophin gene in two unrelated families through 
      Long-read sequencing (LRS). These variants were subsequently confirmed via Sanger 
      sequencing. The first case involved a pericentric inversion extending from DMD 
      intron 47 to Xq27.3. The second case featured a paracentric inversion between DMD 
      intron 42 and Xp21.1, inherited from the mother. In both cases, simple repeat 
      sequences (SRS) were present at the breakpoints of these inversions. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our findings demonstrate that LRS is an effective tool for detecting atypical 
      mutations. The identification of SRS at the breakpoints in DMD patients enhances 
      our understanding of the mechanisms underlying structural variations, thereby 
      facilitating the exploration of potential treatments.

TI  - Medicaid Expansion and Racial-Ethnic and Sex Disparities in Cardiovascular 
      Diseases Over 6 Years: A Generalized Synthetic Control Approach.
PG  - 263-272
LID - 10.1097/EDE.0000000000001691 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested Medicaid expansion enacted in 2014 has 
      resulted in a reduction in overall cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the 
      United States. However, it is unknown whether Medicaid expansion has a similar 
      effect across race-ethnicity and sex. We investigated the effect of Medicaid 
      expansion on CVD mortality across race-ethnicity and sex. METHODS: Data come from 
      the behavioral risk factor surveillance system and the US Centers for Disease 
      Control's Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research, spanning the 
      period 2000-2019. We used the generalized synthetic control method, a 
      quasi-experimental approach, to estimate effects. RESULTS: Medicaid expansion was 
      associated with -5.36 (mean difference [MD], 95% confidence interval [CI] = 
      -22.63, 11.91) CVD deaths per 100,000 persons per year among Blacks; -4.28 (MD, 
      95% CI = -30.08, 21.52) among Hispanics; -3.18 (MD, 95% CI = -8.30, 1.94) among 
      Whites; -5.96 (MD, 95% CI = -15.42, 3.50) among men; and -3.34 (MD, 95% CI = 
      -8.05, 1.37) among women. The difference in mean difference (DMD) between the 
      effect of Medicaid expansion in Blacks compared with Whites was -2.18; (DMD, 95% 
      CI = -20.20, 15.83); between that in Hispanics compared with Whites: -1.10; (DMD, 
      95% CI = -27.40, 25.20) and between that in women compared with men: 2.62; (DMD, 
      95% CI = -7.95, 13.19). CONCLUSIONS: Medicaid expansion was associated with a 
      reduction in CVD mortality overall and in White, Black, Hispanic, male, and 
      female subpopulations. Also, our study did not find any difference or disparity 
      in the effect of Medicaid on CVD across race-ethnicity and sex-gender 
      subpopulations, likely owing to imprecise estimates.

AB  - Introduction: Circulating fetal cells isolated from maternal blood can be used 
      for prenatal testing, representing a safe alternative to invasive testing. The 
      present study investigated the potential of cell-based noninvasive prenatal 
      testing (NIPT) for diagnosing monogenic disorders dependent on the mode of 
      inheritance. Methods: Maternal blood samples were collected from women opting for 
      prenatal diagnostics for specific monogenic disorders (N = 7). Fetal trophoblasts 
      were enriched and stained using magnetic activated cell sorting and isolated by 
      fluorescens activated single-cell sorting. Individual cells were subject to whole 
      genome amplification, and cells of fetal origin were identified by DNA-profiling 
      using short tandem repeat markers. The amplified fetal DNA was input for genetic 
      testing for autosomal dominant-, autosomal recessive-, X-linked and repeat 
      expansion disorders by direct variant analysis and haplotyping. The cell-based 
      NIPT results were compared with those of invasive testing. Results: In two cases 
      at risk of skeletal dysplasia, caused by variants in the FGFR3 gene (autosomal 
      dominant disorders), cell-based NIPT correctly stated an affected fetus, but 
      allelic dropout of the normal alleles were observed in both cases. Cell-based 
      NIPT gave an accurate result in two cases at risk of autosomal recessive 
      disorders, where the parents carried either different diastrophic dysplasia 
      causing variants in the SLC26A2 gene or the same cystic fibrosis disease-causing 
      variant in the CFTR gene. Cell-based NIPT accurately identified an affected male 
      fetus in a pregnancy at risk of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD gene, X-linked 
      recessive disorders). In two cases at risk of the myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DMPK 
      gene, repeat expansion disorder), cell-based NIPT correctly detected an affected 
      and an unaffected fetus, respectively. Discussion: Circulating fetal cells can be 
      used to detect both maternally- and paternally inherited monogenic disorders 
      irrespective of the type of variant, however, the risk of allelic dropout must be 
      considered. We conclude that the clinical interpretation of the cell-based NIPT 
      result thus varies depending on the disorders' mode of inheritance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) for monogenic disorders (PGT-M) 
      for germline mosaicism was previously highly dependent on polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR)-based directed mutation detection combined with linkage analysis 
      of short tandem repeats (STRs). However, the number of STRs is usually limited. 
      In addition, designing suitable probes and optimizing the reaction conditions for 
      multiplex PCR are time-consuming and laborious. Here, we evaluated the 
      effectiveness of next generation sequencing (NGS)-based haplotype linkage 
      analysis in PGT of germline mosaicism. METHODS: PGT-M with NGS-based haplotype 
      linkage analysis was performed for two families with maternal germline mosaicism 
      for an X-linked Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mutation (del exon 45-50) or an 
      autosomal TSC1 mutation (c.2074C > T). Trophectoderm biopsy and multiple 
      displacement amplification (MDA) were performed for a total of nine blastocysts. 
      NGS and Sanger sequencing were performed in genomic DNA of family members and 
      embryonic MDA products to detect DMD deletion and TSC1 mutation, respectively. 
      Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites closely linked to pathogenic mutations 
      were detected with NGS and served in haplotype linkage analysis. NGS-based 
      aneuploidy screening was performed for all embryos to reduce the risk of 
      pregnancy loss. RESULTS: All nine blastocytes showed conclusive PGT results. Each 
      family underwent one or two frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles to obtain a 
      clinical pregnancy, and the prenatal diagnosis showed that the fetus was 
      genotypically normal and euploid for both families. CONCLUSIONS: NGS-SNP could 
      effectively realize PGT for germline mosaicism. Compared with PCR-based methods, 
      the NGS-SNP method with increased polymorphic informative markers can achieve a 
      greater diagnostic accuracy. Further studies are warranted to verify the 
      effectiveness of NGS-based PGT of germline mosaicism cases in the absence of 
      surviving offsprings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by pathogenic variants in 
      the dystrophin gene (DMD). Hypermethylated CGG expansions within DIP2B 5' UTR are 
      associated with an intellectual development disorder. Here, we demonstrate the 
      diagnostic utility of genomic short-read sequencing (SRS) and transcriptome 
      sequencing to identify a novel DMD structural variant (SV) and a DIP2B CGG 
      expansion in a patient with DMD for whom conventional diagnostic testing failed 
      to yield a genetic diagnosis. METHODS: We performed genomic SRS, skeletal muscle 
      transcriptome sequencing, and targeted programmable long-read sequencing (LRS). 
      RESULTS: The proband had a typical DMD clinical presentation, autism spectrum 
      disorder (ASD), and dystrophinopathy on muscle biopsy. Transcriptome analysis 
      identified 6 aberrantly expressed genes; DMD and DIP2B were the strongest 
      underexpression and overexpression outliers, respectively. Genomic SRS identified 
      a 216 kb paracentric inversion (NC_000023.11: g.33162217-33378800) overlapping 2 
      DMD promoters. ExpansionHunter indicated an expansion of 109 CGG repeats within 
      the 5' UTR of DIP2B. Targeted genomic LRS confirmed the SV and genotyped the 
      DIP2B repeat expansion as 270 CGG repeats. DISCUSSION: Here, transcriptome data 
      heavily guided genomic analysis to resolve a complex DMD inversion and a DIP2B 
      repeat expansion. Longitudinal follow-up will be important for clarifying the 
      clinical significance of the DIP2B genotype.

TI  - Differential Binding and Conformational Dynamics of Tau Microtubule-Binding 
      Repeats with a Preformed Amyloid-beta Fibril Seed.
PG  - 1321-1330
LID - 10.1021/acschemneuro.3c00014 [doi]
AB  - Both senile plaques formed by amyloid-beta (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) 
      comprised of tau are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 
      accumulation of NFTs better correlates with the loss of cognitive function than 
      senile plaques, but NFTs are rarely observed without the presence of senile 
      plaques. Hence, cross-seeding of tau by preformed Abeta amyloid fibril seeds has 
      been proposed to drive the aggregation of tau and exacerbate AD progression, but 
      the molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we first identified 
      cross-interaction hotspots between Abeta and tau using atomistic discrete molecular 
      dynamics simulations (DMD) and confirmed the critical role of the four 
      microtubule-binding repeats of tau (R1-R4) in the cross-interaction with Abeta. We 
      further investigated the binding structure and dynamics of each tau repeat with a 
      preformed Abeta fibril seed. Specifically, R1 and R3 preferred to bind the Abeta fibril 
      lateral surface instead of the elongation end. In contrast, R2 and R4 had higher 
      binding propensities to the fibril elongation end than the lateral surface, 
      enhancing beta-sheet content by forming hydrogen bonds with the exposed hydrogen 
      bond donors and acceptors. Together, our results suggest that the four repeats 
      play distinct roles in driving the binding of tau to different surfaces of an Abeta 
      fibril seed. Binding of tau to the lateral surface of Abeta fibril can increase the 
      local concentration, while the binding to the elongation surface promotes beta-sheet 
      formation, both of which reduce the free energy barrier for tau aggregation

AB  - Dystrophinopathy is caused by alterations in DMD. Approximately 1% of patients 
      remain genetically undiagnosed, because intronic variations are not detected by 
      standard methods. Here, we combined laboratory and in silico analyses to identify 
      disease-causing genomic variants in genetically undiagnosed patients and 
      determine the regulatory mechanisms underlying abnormal DMD transcript 
      generation. DMD transcripts from 20 genetically undiagnosed dystrophinopathy 
      patients in whom no exon variants were identified, despite dystrophin deficiency 
      on muscle biopsy, were analyzed by transcriptome sequencing. Genome sequencing 
      captured intronic variants and their effects were interpreted using in silico 
      tools. Targeted long-read sequencing was applied in cases with suspected 
      structural genomic abnormalities. Abnormal DMD transcripts were detected in 19 of 
      20 cases; Exonization of intronic sequences in 15 cases, exon skipping in one 
      case, aberrantly spliced and polyadenylated transcripts in two cases and 
      transcription termination in one case. Intronic single nucleotide variants, 
      chromosomal rearrangements and nucleotide repeat expansion were identified in DMD 
      gene as pathogenic causes of transcript alteration. Our combined analysis 
      approach successfully identified pathogenic events. Detection of 
      diseasing-causing mechanisms in DMD transcripts could inform the therapeutic 
      options for patients with dystrophinopathy.

AB  - Expanded carrier screening (ECS) has become an increasingly common technique to 
      assess the genetic risks of individuals in the prenatal or preconception period. 
      Unexpected variants unrelated to referral are being increasingly detected in 
      asymptomatic individuals through ECS. In this study, we reported an asymptomatic 
      male with duplication of exons 56-61 in the DMD gene through ECS using 
      whole-exome sequencing (WES), which was also detected in a male patient diagnosed 
      with typical Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Breakpoint analysis was then 
      performed to explore the potential mechanisms of phenotypic differences using 
      long-read sequencing (LRS), PacBio single-molecule real-time (PacBio SMRT) target 
      sequencing, and Sanger sequencing. Complex structural variations (SVs) on 
      chromosome X were identified in the asymptomatic male, which revealed that the 
      duplication occurred outside the DMD gene; whereas, the duplication in the 
      patient with DMD was a tandem repeat. The phenotypic differences between the two 
      men could be explained by the different breakpoint junctions. To the best of our 
      knowledge, this is the first report of a breakpoint analysis of DMD duplication 
      in two men with different phenotypes. Breakpoint analysis is necessary when the 
      clinical phenotypes are inconsistent with genotypes, and it applies to prenatal 
      testing.

AB  - We report the case of a patient with dystrophinopathy caused by DMD exon 2 
      duplication, showing marked asymmetric muscle atrophy. Immunostaining of the 
      biopsied muscle tissue showed a mosaic staining, suggesting a somatic mosaicism. 
      Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed only one breakpoint, and 
      long-read whole-genome sequencing revealed the entire structure of the rearranged 
      sequence. The complex rearrangement was composed of two tandem duplications: one 
      showed a microhomology near the breakpoint, suggesting a microhomology-mediated 
      mechanism, whereas the other was associated with flanking short tandem repeats. 
      The long-read sequencing also suggested the presence of a wild-type nonduplicated 
      sequence, supporting somatic mosaicism. Whereas complementary DNA and western 
      blot analyses were not useful, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) analysis showed an 
      average copy number of 1.61, enabling accurate estimation of the proportion of 
      cells containing the duplication. Long-read sequencing and ddPCR analysis were 
      useful for revealing the rearrangements and the precise copy number.

AB  - CTG repeat expansion (CTG(exp)) is associated with aberrant alternate splicing 
      that contributes to cardiac dysfunction in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). 
      Excision of this CTG(exp) repeat using CRISPR-Cas resulted in the disappearance 
      of punctate ribonuclear foci in cardiomyocyte-like cells derived from DM1-induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This was associated with correction of the 
      underlying spliceopathy as determined by RNA sequencing and alternate splicing 
      analysis. Certain genes were of particular interest due to their role in cardiac 
      development, maturation, and function (TPM4, CYP2J2, DMD, MBNL3, CACNA1H, ROCK2, 
      ACTB) or their association with splicing (SMN2, GCFC2, MBNL3). Moreover, while 
      comparing isogenic CRISPR-Cas9-corrected versus non-corrected DM1 cardiomyocytes, 
      a prominent difference in the splicing pattern for a number of candidate genes 
      was apparent pertaining to genes that are associated with cardiac function (TNNT, 
      TNNT2, TTN, TPM1, SYNE1, CACNA1A, MTMR1, NEBL, TPM1), cellular signaling (NCOR2, 
      CLIP1, LRRFIP2, CLASP1, CAMK2G), and other DM1-related genes (i.e., NUMA1, MBNL2, 
      LDB3) in addition to the disease-causing DMPK gene itself. Subsequent validation 
      using a selected gene subset, including MBNL1, MBNL2, INSR, ADD3, and CRTC2, 
      further confirmed correction of the spliceopathy following CTG(exp) repeat 
      excision. To our knowledge, the present study provides the first comprehensive 
      unbiased transcriptome-wide analysis of the differential splicing landscape in 
      DM1 patient-derived cardiac cells after excision of the CTG(exp) repeat using 
      CRISPR-Cas9, showing reversal of the abnormal cardiac spliceopathy in DM1.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: DMD/BMD prenatal diagnosis for 931 foetuses. BACKGROUND: DMD is the 
      most common fatal X-linked recessive muscular disease. There is no effective 
      clinical treatment method at present. Accurate gene diagnosis and prenatal 
      diagnosis technology are important ways for early detection, early prevention and 
      early treatment. METHODS: A total of 931 prenatal diagnoses were performed for 
      pregnant women with a definite family history of DMD or a history of DMD 
      childbirth between 2005 and 2019. This report may be considered the largest DMD 
      prenatal diagnosis report in a single centre worldwide. Multiple 
      ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and next-generation sequencing were 
      used in combination. Techniques and short tandem repeat (STR) linkage analysis 
      were used to determine the location of the DMD gene mutation in the pregnant 
      woman and then to detect the DMD gene in the foetuses. RESULTS: There were 872 
      families in our study. Among all 931 foetuses, 20.73% (193/931) were males 
      expected to develop DMD and 16.33% (152/931) were female carriers. In addition, 
      gonadal mosaicism was observed in 5 mothers, and gene recombination was 
      identified in three foetuses. The results of the prenatal diagnosis were 
      consistent with the results of the CPK analysis, and the results of the prenatal 
      diagnosis were 100% accurate. CONCLUSIONS: MLPA and Sanger sequencing, when 
      combined with STR linkage analyses, can provide an accurate and rapid prenatal 
      diagnosis. Due to the high de novo rate, prenatal diagnosis and genetic 
      counselling should be given great attention.

TI  - Transplantation of Dystrophin Expressing Chimeric Human Cells of 
      Myoblast/Mesenchymal Stem Cell Origin Improves Function in Duchenne Muscular 
      Dystrophy Model.
PG  - 190-202
LID - 10.1089/scd.2020.0161 [doi]
AB  - Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal X-linked disorder caused by 
      mutations in dystrophin gene. Currently, there is no cure for DMD. Cell therapies 
      are challenged by limited engraftment and rejection. Thus, more effective and 
      safer therapeutic approaches are needed for DMD. We previously reported increased 
      dystrophin expression correlating with improved function after transplantation of 
      dystrophin expressing chimeric (DEC) cells of myoblast origin in the mdx mouse 
      models of DMD. This study established new DEC cell line of myoblasts and 
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) origin and tested its efficacy and therapeutic 
      potential in mdx/scid mouse model of DMD. Fifteen ex vivo cell fusions of 
      allogenic human myoblast [normal myoblasts (MB(N))] and normal human bone 
      marrow-derived MSC (MSC(N)) from normal donors were performed using polyethylene 
      glycol. Flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR)-short tandem repeats, polymerase chain reaction-reverse sequence-specific 
      oligonucleotide probe assessed chimeric state of fused MB(N)/MSC(N) DEC cells, 
      whereas Comet assay assessed fusion procedure safety testing genotoxicity. 
      Immunofluorescence and real-time PCR assessed dystrophin expression and myogenic 
      differentiation. Mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) evaluated DEC's immunogenicity. 
      To test MB(N)/MSC(N) DEC efficacy in vivo, gastrocnemius muscle of mdx/scid mice 
      were injected with vehicle (n = 12), nonfused MB(N) and MSC(N) (n = 9, 
      0.25 x 10(6)/each) or MB(N)/MSC(N) DEC (n = 9, 0.5 x 10(6)). Animals were 
      evaluated for 90 days using ex vivo and in vivo muscle strength tests. Histology 
      and immunofluorescence staining assessed dystrophin expression, centrally 
      nucleated fibers and scar tissue formation. Post-fusion, MB(N)/MSC(N) DEC 
      chimeric state, myogenic differentiation, and dystrophin expression were 
      confirmed. MLR reveled reduced DEC's immune response compared with controls 
      (P < 0.05). At 90 days post-DEC transplant, increase in dystrophin expression 
      (20.26% +/- 2.5%, P < 0.05) correlated with improved muscle strength and function 
      in mdx/scid mice. The created human MB(N)/MSC(N) DEC cell line introduces novel 
      therapeutic approach combining myogenic and immunomodulatory properties of MB and 
      MSC, and as such may open a universal approach for muscle regeneration in DMD.

LID - 5210
AB  - Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) lack the protein dystrophin, 
      which is a critical molecular component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex 
      (DGC). Dystrophin is hypothesized to function as a molecular shock absorber that 
      mechanically stabilizes the sarcolemma of striated muscle through interaction 
      with the cortical actin cytoskeleton via its N-terminal half and with the 
      transmembrane protein beta-dystroglycan via its C-terminal region. Utrophin is a 
      fetal homologue of dystrophin that can subserve many dystrophin functions and is 
      therefore under active investigation as a dystrophin replacement therapy for DMD. 
      Here, we report the first mechanical characterization of utrophin using atomic 
      force microscopy (AFM). Our data indicate that the mechanical properties of 
      spectrin-like repeats in utrophin are more in line with the PEVK and Ig-like 
      repeats of titin rather than those reported for repeats in spectrin or 
      dystrophin. Moreover, we measured markedly different unfolding characteristics 
      for spectrin repeats within the N-terminal actin-binding half of utrophin 
      compared to those in the C-terminal dystroglycan-binding half, even though they 
      exhibit identical thermal denaturation profiles. Our results demonstrate dramatic 
      differences in the mechanical properties of structurally homologous utrophin 
      constructs and suggest that utrophin may function as a stiff elastic element in 
      series with titin at the myotendinous junction.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The system of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
      repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated proteins (cas) is a new technology that 
      allows easier manipulation of the genome. Its potential to edit genes opened a 
      new door in treatment development for incurable neurological monogenic diseases 
      (NMGDs). The aim of this systematic review was to summarise the findings on the 
      current development of CRISPR-cas for therapeutic purposes in the most frequent 
      NMGDs and provide critical assessment. METHODS AND DATA ACQUISITION: We searched 
      the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, looking for original studies on the use of 
      CRISPR-cas to edit pathogenic variants in models of the most frequent NMGDs, 
      until end of 2017. We included all the studies that met the following criteria: 
      1. Peer-reviewed study report with explicitly described experimental designs; 2. 
      In vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo study using human or other animal biological 
      systems (including cells, tissues, organs, organisms); 3. focusing on CRISPR as 
      the gene-editing method of choice; and 5. featured at least one NMGD. RESULTS: We 
      obtained 404 papers from MEDLINE and 513 from EMBASE. After removing the 
      duplicates, we screened 490 papers by title and abstract and assessed them for 
      eligibility. After reading 50 full-text papers, we finally selected 42 for the 
      review. DISCUSSION: Here we give a systematic summary on the preclinical 
      development of CRISPR-cas for therapeutic purposes in NMGDs. Furthermore, we 
      address the clinical interpretability of the findings, giving a comprehensive 
      overview of the current state of the art. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) 
      paves the way forward, with 26 out of 42 studies reporting different strategies 
      on DMD gene editing in different models of the disease. Most of the strategies 
      aimed for permanent exon skipping by deletion with CRISPR-cas. Successful 
      silencing of the mHTT gene with CRISPR-cas led to successful reversal of the 
      neurotoxic effects in the striatum of mouse models of Huntington's disease. Many 
      other strategies have been explored, including epigenetic regulation of gene 
      expression, in cellular and animal models of: myotonic dystrophy, Fraxile X 
      syndrome, ataxias, and other less frequent dystrophies. Still, before even 
      considering the clinical application of CRISPR-cas, three major bottlenecks need 
      to be addressed: efficacy, safety, and delivery of the systems. This requires a 
      collaborative approach in the research community, while having ethical 
      considerations in mind.

TI  - Perspective: Spectrin-Like Repeats in Dystrophin Have Unique Binding Preferences 
      for Syntrophin Adaptors That Explain the Mystery of How nNOSmu Localizes to the 
      Sarcolemma.

AB  - Dystrophin is a massive multi-domain protein composed of specialized amino and 
      carboxyl termini that are separated by 24 spectrin-like repeats. Dystrophin 
      performs critical structural and signaling roles that are indispensable for the 
      functional integrity of skeletal muscle. Indeed, the loss of dystrophin protein 
      expression causes the muscle wasting disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). 
      Substantial progress has been made in defining the functions of the domains of 
      dystrophin, which has proven invaluable for the development of miniaturized 
      dystrophin gene and exon skipping therapies for DMD. However, a long-standing 
      mystery regarding dystrophin function is how dystrophin, and its adaptor and 
      neuronal nitric oxide synthase mu (nNOSmu) binding partner alpha-syntrophin, cooperate 
      to localize nNOSmu to the sarcolemma. Only when localized to the sarcolemma can 
      nNOSmu override sympathetic vasoconstriction and prevent functional ischemia in 
      contracting muscles. Current evidence suggests that spectrin-like repeat 17 of 
      dystrophin and alpha-syntrophin cooperate to localize nNOSmu to the sarcolemma. 
      However, the exact mechanism remains unclear and controversial because of 
      equivocal evidence for direct binding of dystrophin and nNOSmu. Recently, an 
      important study identified a novel alpha-syntrophin binding site within spectrin-like 
      repeat 17, leading to a new model whereby alpha-syntrophin recruits nNOSmu to the 
      sarcolemmal dystrophin complex by binding spectrin-like repeat 17. This model 
      finally appears to solve the mystery of the dual requirement for dystrophin and 
      alpha-syntrophin for sarcolemmal nNOSmu localization. The aim of the current 
      perspective is to highlight this major advance in understanding of dystrophin's 
      role in localizing nNOSmu and its implications for current trials.

TI  - Performance comparison of two whole genome amplification techniques in frame of 
      multifactor preimplantation genetic testing.
PG  - 1457-1472
LID - 10.1007/s10815-018-1187-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare multiple displacement amplification and OmniPlex whole genome 
      amplification technique performance during array comparative genome hybridization 
      (aCGH), Sanger sequencing, SNaPshot and fragment size analysis downstream 
      applications in frame of multifactor embryo preimplantation genetic testing. 
      METHODS: Preclinical workup included linked short tandem repeat (STR) marker 
      selection and primer design for loci of interest. It was followed by a family 
      haplotyping, after which an in vitro fertilization preimplantation genetic 
      testing (IVF-PGT) cycle was carried out. A total of 62 embryos were retrieved 
      from nine couples with a confirmed single gene disorder being transmitted in 
      their family with various inheritance traits-autosomal dominant (genes-ACTA2, 
      HTT, KRT14), autosomal recessive (genes-ALOX12B, TPP1, GLB1) and X-linked 
      (genes-MTM1, DMD). Whole genome amplification (WGA) for the day 5 embryo 
      trophectoderm single biopsies was carried out by multiple displacement 
      amplification (MDA) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technology OmniPlex 
      and was used for direct (Sanger sequencing, fragment size analysis, SNaPshot) and 
      indirect mutation assessment (STR marker haplotyping), and embryo aneuploidy 
      testing by array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH). RESULTS: Family 
      haplotyping revealed informative/semi-informative microsatellite markers for all 
      clinical cases for all types of inheritance. Indirect testing gave a persuasive 
      conclusion for all embryos assessed, which was confirmed through direct testing. 
      The overall allele dropout (ADO) rate was higher for PCR-based WGA, and MDA shows 
      a better genomic recovery scale. Five euploid embryos were subjected to elective 
      single embryo transfer (eSET), which resulted in four clinical pregnancies and 
      birth of two healthy children, which proved free of disease causative variants 
      running in the family postnataly. CONCLUSIONS: A developed multifactor PGT 
      protocol can be adapted and applied to virtually any genetic condition and is 
      capable of improving single gene disorder preimplantation genetic testing in a 
      patient-tailored manner thus increasing pregnancy rates, saving costs and 
      increasing patient reliability.

TI  - Impaired regenerative capacity and lower revertant fibre expansion in 
      dystrophin-deficient mdx muscles on DBA/2 background.
PG  - 38371
LID - 10.1038/srep38371 [doi]
LID - 38371
AB  - Duchenne muscular dystrophy, one of the most common lethal genetic disorders, is 
      caused by mutations in the DMD gene and a lack of dystrophin protein. In most DMD 
      patients and animal models, sporadic dystrophin-positive muscle fibres, called 
      revertant fibres (RFs), are observed in otherwise dystrophin-negative 
      backgrounds. RFs are thought to arise from skeletal muscle precursor cells and 
      clonally expand with age due to the frequent regeneration of necrotic fibres. 
      Here we examined the effects of genetic background on muscle regeneration and RF 
      expansion by comparing dystrophin-deficient mdx mice on the C57BL/6 background 
      (mdx-B6) with those on the DBA/2 background (mdx-DBA), which have a more severe 
      phenotype. Interestingly, mdx-DBA muscles had significantly lower RF expansion 
      than mdx-B6 in all age groups, including 2, 6, 12, and 18 months. The percentage 
      of centrally nucleated fibres was also significantly lower in mdx-DBA mice 
      compared to mdx-B6, indicating that less muscle regeneration occurs in mdx-DBA. 
      Our study aligns with the model that RF expansion reflects the activity of 
      precursor cells in skeletal muscles, and it serves as an index of muscle 
      regeneration capacity.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The dystrophinopathies include a spectrum of muscle diseases caused 
      by mutations in the dystrophin (DMD) gene. The clinical phenotype ranges from 
      severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy to a mild phenotype with elevated creatine 
      kinase (CK). METHODS: Clinical and molecular assessment of 7 patients carrying a 
      single amino acid loss in the dystrophin protein (p.His1690del) caused by a 
      c.5068_5070delCAC tri-nucleotide deletion in exon 36 of the DMD gene. RESULTS: 
      All patients were asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic and had elevated CK levels. 
      Febrile illness, but not exercise, induced muscle symptoms in some patients. None 
      had evidence of cardiomyopathy. Analysis of the short tandem repeat (STR)45 locus 
      and sequencing of exon 36 of the DMD gene indicates that c.5068_5070delCAC is a 
      founder mutation. CONCLUSIONS: The c.5068_5070delCAC locus in the DMD gene is 
      associated with a very mild phenotype. Further study is needed to evaluate 
      disease progression in these patients. Muscle Nerve 55: 46-50, 2017.

      counseling. Haplotyping with polymorphic markers and quantitation of creatine 
      kinase levels (CK) allow tracking of the at-risk haplotype and evidence muscle 
      damage, respectively. Such approaches are useful for carrier detection in cases 
      of unknown mutations. The lack of informative markers and the inaccuracy of CK 
      affect carrier detection. Therefore, herein we designed novel mini-STR (Short 
      Tandem Repeats) assays to amplify 10 loci within the DMD gene and estimated 
      allele frequencies and the polymorphism information content among other 
      parameters in 337 unrelated individuals from three Mexican populations. In 
      addition, we tested the utility of the assays for carrier detection in three 
      families. Moreover, given that serum levels of miR-206 discern between DMD 
      patients and controls with a high area under the curve (AUC), the potential 
      applicability for carrier detection was assessed. The serum levels of miR-206 of 
      non-carriers (n = 24) and carriers (n = 23) were compared by relative 
      quantitation using real-time PCR (p < 0.05), which resulted in an AUC = 0.80 in 
      the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis. In conclusion, miR-206 has 
      potential as a "liquid biopsy" for carrier detection and genetic counseling in 
      DMD.

AB  - Dystrophinopathies are allelic X-linked myopathies caused by large 
      deletions/duplications or small lesions along the DMD gene. An unexpected dynamic 
      trinucleotide (GAA) expansion, ranging from  approximately 59 to 82 pure GAA repeats, within 
      the DMD intron 62, was revealed to segregate through three family generations. 
      From the pedigree, two female patients were referred for DMD investigation due to 
      chronic myopathy and a muscle biopsy compatible with dystrophinopathy. As the 
      size of the GAA repeat is limited to 11-33 within the general population our 
      findings may provide a novel insight towards a Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion. 
      Whether this TNR has an impact on the reported phenotype remains to be resolved.

TI  - A rare form of limb girdle muscular dystrophy (type 2E) seen in an Iranian family 
      detected by autozygosity mapping.
PG  - 1-4

AB  - Sarcoglycanopathies (SGPs) constitute a subgroup of autosomal recessive limb 
      girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) which are caused by mutations in sarcoglycan 
      (SGs) genes. SG proteins form a core complex consisting of alpha, beta, gamma and delta 
      sarcoglycans which are encoded by SGCA, SGCB, SGCG and SGCD genes, respectively. 
      Genetic defect, in any of these SG proteins, results in instability of the whole 
      complex. This effect can be helpful in interpreting muscle biopsy results. 
      Autozygosity mapping is a gene mapping approach which can be applied in large 
      consanguineous families for tracking the defective gene in most autosomal 
      recessive disorders. In the present study, we used autozygosity mapping, to find 
      the gene responsible for muscular dystrophy. Proband was a 10-year-old boy 
      referred to our center for ruling out DMD (Duchenne muscular dystrophy). 
      According to the pedigree and clinical reports, we assessed him for SGPs. 
      Haplotyping, using the four short tandem repeat (STR) markers for each of the SG 
      genes, showed that the phenotype may segregate with SGCB gene; and observing two 
      crossing overs which occurred within the gene suggested that the mutation might 
      be in the first two exons of SGCB gene. Mutation analysis showed a 26 bp 
      duplication (10 bp before the initiation codon till 13 bp after the ATG start 
      codon). This will cause a frameshift in protein synthesis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since there is no effective curative treatment for Duchenne muscular 
      dystrophy (DMD), prevention mostly depends on genetic counseling and prenatal 
      diagnosis. About two-thirds of the affected patients have large deletions or 
      duplications, which can be detected by multiplex ligation-dependent amplification 
      (MLPA). The remaining cases include small mutations, which cannot be easily 
      identified by routine techniques. In such cases, linkage analysis may be a useful 
      tool for prenatal diagnosis. Here we compared results obtained from linkage using 
      short tandem repeats (STRs) with those by MLPA and sequencing analysis. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Eight Vietnamese pregnant women at risk of having a baby with DMD 
      and requesting prenatal diagnosis were recruited in this study. MLPA and direct 
      sequencing were applied to screen large rearrangements and point mutations in the 
      dystrophin gene in the DMD probands and the fetal samples. STR linkage was also 
      performed to analyze fetal mutation status. RESULTS: By MLPA and sequencing 
      analysis, five DMD patients showed deletions of the dystrophin gene, and no 
      deletions of exons were detected in seven amniotic fluid cell samples; one 
      patient harbored the out-of-frame small deletion of exon 43, which was also found 
      in the fetal sample of this family. STR analysis revealed the transmission of a 
      mutant allele inside each family. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the 
      combination of STR and MLPA could be a rapid, reliable, and affordable detection 
      protocol for determination of the carrier's status and prenatal diagnosis of DMD 
      in a developing country such as Vietnam.

TI  - A new de novo mutation in a non-hot spot region at the DMD gene in a Mexican 
      family.
PG  - 429-32
AB  - In this report we present the analysis of a sporadic case of DMD and his family. 
      In the present case, a deletion of exons 18-47 is presented which predicts 
      abolition of the reading frame and is located between the well-known deletion hot 
      spots of the DMD gene. This mutation was not previously reported in the Leiden 
      database (LOVD). Both MLPA and segregation analysis with short tandem repeat 
      markers elucidated the status of the mother, sister and the younger brother of 
      the proband, who were not carriers of the mutation. This case provides a 
      description of a new pathogenic variant presented as de novo mutation in a DMD 
      patient. Haplotype analysis and complete gene screening may improve genetic 
      counseling in cases of germline mosaicism and de novo mutations.

AB  - Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors have been shown to permit very 
      efficient widespread transgene expression in skeletal muscle after systemic 
      delivery, making these increasingly attractive as vectors for Duchenne muscular 
      dystrophy (DMD) gene therapy. DMD is a severe muscle-wasting disorder caused by 
      DMD gene mutations leading to complete loss of dystrophin protein. One of the 
      major issues associated with delivery of the DMD gene, as a therapeutic approach 
      for DMD, is its large open reading frame (ORF; 11.1 kb). A series of truncated 
      microdystrophin cDNAs (delivered via a single AAV) and minidystrophin cDNAs 
      (delivered via dual-AAV trans-spliced/overlapping reconstitution) have thus been 
      extensively tested in DMD animal models. However, critical rod and hinge domains 
      of dystrophin required for interaction with components of the 
      dystrophin-associated protein complex, such as neuronal nitric oxide synthase, 
      syntrophin, and dystrobrevin, are missing; these dystrophin domains may still 
      need to be incorporated to increase dystrophin functionality and stabilize 
      membrane rigidity. Full-length DMD gene delivery using AAV vectors remains 
      elusive because of the limited single-AAV packaging capacity (4.7 kb). Here we 
      developed a novel method for the delivery of the full-length DMD coding sequence 
      to skeletal muscles in dystrophic mdx mice using a triple-AAV trans-splicing 
      vector system. We report for the first time that three independent AAV vectors 
      carrying "in tandem" sequential exonic parts of the human DMD coding sequence 
      enable the expression of the full-length protein as a result of trans-splicing 
      events cojoining three vectors via their inverted terminal repeat sequences. This 
      method of triple-AAV-mediated trans-splicing could be applicable to the delivery 
      of any large therapeutic gene (>/=11 kb ORF) into postmitotic tissues (muscles or 
      neurons) for the treatment of various inherited metabolic and genetic diseases.

AB  - Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), one of the most common and lethal genetic 
      disorders, and the mdx mouse myopathies are caused by a lack of dystrophin 
      protein. These dystrophic muscles contain sporadic clusters of 
      dystrophin-expressing revertant fibers (RFs), as detected by 
      immunohistochemistry. RFs are known to arise from muscle precursor cells with 
      spontaneous exon skipping (alternative splicing) and clonally expand in size with 
      increasing age through the process of muscle degeneration/regeneration. The 
      expansion of revertant clusters is thought to represent the cumulative history of 
      muscle regeneration and proliferation of such precursor cells. However, the 
      precise mechanisms by which RFs arise and expand are poorly understood. Here, to 
      test the effects of mutation types and aging on RF expansion and muscle 
      regeneration, we examined the number of RFs in mdx mice (containing a nonsense 
      mutation in exon 23) and mdx52 mice (containing deletion mutation of exon 52) 
      with the same C57BL/6 background at 2, 6, 12, and 18months of age. Mdx mice 
      displayed a significantly higher number of RFs compared to mdx52 mice in all age 
      groups, suggesting that revertant fiber expansion largely depends on the type of 
      mutation and/or location in the gene. A significant increase in the expression 
      and clustering levels of RFs was found beginning at 6months of age in mdx mice 
      compared with mdx52 mice. In contrast to the significant expansion of RFs with 
      increasing age, the number of centrally nucleated fibers and embryonic myosin 
      heavy chain-positive fibers (indicative of cumulative and current muscle 
      regeneration, respectively) decreased with age in both mouse strains. These 
      results suggest that mutation types and aging differently affect revertant fiber 
      expansion in mdx and mdx52 mice.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dystrophinopathies are X-linked recessive neuromuscular diseases 
      caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. In this study we aimed to detect 
      mutations within the dystrophin gene in DMD patients, to determine the carrier 
      status of women, and to perform a prenatal diagnosis. METHODS: We analyzed 17 
      individuals from 2 unrelated families with a history of DMD. We used multiplex 
      PCR, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and short 
      tandem-repeat (STR) segregation analysis to accurately detect and characterize 
      the mutations and to identify the at-risk haplotype. RESULTS: The selected 
      methodology allowed for characterization of 2 single-exon out-of-frame deletions 
      in affected patients. Nine of 13 women and a fetus were excluded from being 
      carriers. Three recombination events were found and suggested that germline 
      mosaicism had occurred in both families. CONCLUSIONS: This methodology proved to 
      be efficient for characterizing the disease-causing mutation in affected 
      individuals and for assessing the carrier status in healthy relatives. These 
      findings helped inform precise genetic counseling and contributed to 
      characterization of the disease in the Argentine population.

TI  - Ataxin-3 protein modification as a treatment strategy for spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 3: removal of the CAG containing exon.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the 
      ataxin-3 protein, resulting in gain of toxic function of the mutant protein. The 
      expanded glutamine stretch in the protein is the result of a CAG triplet repeat 
      expansion in the penultimate exon of the ATXN3 gene. Several gene silencing 
      approaches to reduce mutant ataxin-3 toxicity in this disease aim to lower 
      ataxin-3 protein levels, but since this protein is involved in deubiquitination 
      and proteasomal protein degradation, its long-term silencing might not be 
      desirable. Here, we propose a novel protein modification approach to reduce 
      mutant ataxin-3 toxicity by removing the toxic polyglutamine repeat from the 
      ataxin-3 protein through antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping while 
      maintaining important wild type functions of the protein. In vitro studies showed 
      that exon skipping did not negatively impact the ubiquitin binding capacity of 
      ataxin-3. Our in vivo studies showed no toxic properties of the novel truncated 
      ataxin-3 protein. These results suggest that exon skipping may be a novel 
      therapeutic approach to reduce polyglutamine-induced toxicity in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 3.

AB  - The human X chromosome carries regions prone to genomic instability: deletions in 
      the Xp22.31 region, involving the steroid sulfatase gene (STS) cause X-linked 
      ichthyosis; rearrangements in the Xp21.2 region are associated with Duchenne or 
      Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD or BMD); and the Xq27.3 unstable region, 
      containing the (CGG)n repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene is associated with 
      fragile X syndrome. We report on a family with two affected boys, the elder 
      diagnosed with fragile X syndrome, the younger with DMD, and both suffering from 
      severe ichthyosis. The family was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction, 
      multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and haplotype analysis. The 
      mother proved to be an asymptomatic carrier of all three non-contiguous mutation 
      events, involving the STS gene, the DMD gene and a FMR1 expansion. To the best of 
      our knowledge, this is the first description of an asymptomatic carrier of three 
      different X-linked disorders, involving severe genetic rearrangements on both 
      long and short arms of the X chromosomes. The boy with fragile X syndrome has 
      inherited a triple recombinant maternal X chromosome, this way inheriting the 
      FMR1 expansion and ichthyosis, originating most probably from different maternal 
      Xes and excluding the DMD gene deletion. The transmission of these extremely 
      defective maternal chromosomes to the next generation involved several 
      recombinations.

TI  - Thoracic cirtometry in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy--expansion of 
      the method.
PG  - 1-8
LID - S1413-35552013000100002 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thoracic cirtometry is a simple and accessible technique to evaluate 
      chest mobility during forced breathing. However, it does not allow for the 
      assessment of compensatory movements commonly used by people with chronic 
      diseases, such Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is a condition 
      characterized by progressive and irreversible degeneration of the musculoskeletal 
      system. OBJECTIVES: To expand the method of thoracic cirtometry to allow for the 
      assessment of compensatory movements; to analyze the reliability of the tool; and 
      to describe thoracic mobility of children with DMD during deep breathing. METHOD: 
      Sixty boys, 30 with DMD (10.1+/-0.5 years) and 30 healthy controls (9.5+/-0.6 years) 
      participated in the study. The expanded thoracic cirtometry was organized in two 
      phases: 1. the body could move freely, allowing the assessment of compensatory 
      movements (free thoracic cirtometry) and 2. the body without compensatory 
      movements, allowing for the direct study of the movements of the chest (guided 
      thoracic cirtometry). This method includes videotaping and systematic observation 
      of body movements using descriptive and numeric data. We investigated reliability 
      of these measures in both groups. RESULTS: Measures of axial and the xiphoid 
      thoracic cirtometry (both free and guided) showed excellent reliability. All 
      measures were significantly different between groups. In DMD boys, free thoracic 
      cirtometry presented a greater value of chest expansion when compared with the 
      guided measures, which probably occurred due to compensatory movements. The most 
      commons were movements of the head, shoulder and torso. CONCLUSIONS: The expanded 
      thoracic cirtometry method showed excellent reliability and achieved the 
      objectives of determining measures of chest mobility and compensatory movements 
      during deep breath. We suggested its use in the respiratory evaluation of 
      children with DMD.

AB  - Dystrophin is a large protein involved in the rare genetic disease Duchenne 
      muscular dystrophy (DMD). It functions as a mechanical linker between the 
      cytoskeleton and the sarcolemma, and is able to resist shear stresses during 
      muscle activity. In all, 75% of the dystrophin molecule consists of a large 
      central rod domain made up of 24 repeat units that share high structural homology 
      with spectrin-like repeats. However, in the absence of any high-resolution 
      structure of these repeats, the molecular basis of dystrophin central domain's 
      functions has not yet been deciphered. In this context, we have performed a 
      computational study of the whole dystrophin central rod domain based on the 
      rational homology modeling of successive and overlapping tandem repeats and the 
      analysis of their surface properties. Each tandem repeat has very specific 
      surface properties that make it unique. However, the repeats share enough 
      electrostatic-surface similarities to be grouped into four separate clusters. 
      Molecular dynamics simulations of four representative tandem repeats reveal 
      specific flexibility or bending properties depending on the repeat sequence. We 
      thus suggest that the dystrophin central rod domain is constituted of seven 
      biologically relevant sub-domains. Our results provide evidence for the role of 
      the dystrophin central rod domain as a scaffold platform with a wide range of 
      surface features and biophysical properties allowing it to interact with its 
      various known partners such as proteins and membrane lipids. This new integrative 
      view is strongly supported by the previous experimental works that investigated 
      the isolated domains and the observed heterogeneity of the severity of dystrophin 
      related pathologies, especially Becker muscular dystrophy.

      segregation analysis in Argentine families.
PG  - 510-7
LID - 10.1002/mus.21904 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD/BMD) are X-linked 
      recessive diseases caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. METHODS: We used 
      multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and short tandem repeat (STR) 
      segregation analysis for DMD/BMD-carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-four at-risk pregnancies were evaluated: 17 were excluded from 
      carrying dystrophin gene mutations with 95-100% certainty. Of the remaining 
      cases, 2 were determined to carry a dystrophin gene mutation with 95-100% 
      certainty. Three cases had a 67% probability of carrying the mutation, and 2 
      others were not informative. The certainty of the test increased to ~100% in some 
      cases due to the identification of several genetic events: 4 recombinations; 4 de 
      novo mutations; and 8 deletions encompassing some of the STRs evaluated. 
      DISCUSSION: Overall, 19 of 24 (79%) molecular prenatal diagnoses were 
      informative, indicating that multiplex PCR/STR segregation analysis is a reliable 
      method for carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis when other more sophisticated 
      techniques are unavailable.

TI  - Comparison of serum creatine kinase estimation with short tandem repeats based 
      linkage analysis in carriers and affected children of Duchenne muscular 
      dystrophy.
PG  - 125-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive lethal, 
      genetic disorder characterised by progressive weakness of skeletal muscles which 
      is untreatable and transmitted to males by carrier females. Advances in 
      laboratory techniques now focus direct mutational analysis as the most reliable 
      and indirect analysis based on Short Tandem Repeats (STR) based linkage analysis 
      as feasible, inexpensive, and efficient method for carrier detection and prenatal 
      diagnosis. The objective of this study was to compare the sensitivity, 
      specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and 
      diagnostic efficiency of Serum Creatine Kinase (SCK) with Short Tandem Repeats 
      (STR) based linkage analysis in carriers and affected children of Duchenne 
      Muscular Dystrophy. METHODS: The study was carried out from Dec 2006 to Dec 2007 
      in families having index clinical cases of DMD who were referred from different 
      hospitals for evaluation/workup of DMD. SCK was done as a preliminary 
      investigation in all index cases. The PCR assay with STR based linkage analysis 
      with Intron 44, 45, 49 and 50 of DMD gene were performed in all families. Six 
      families were informative with Intron 44 of DMD gene and one family was 
      non-informative with all four intronic markers of DMD. SCK analyses were done in 
      all the family members and compared with PCR analysis in informative families. 
      SCK was not performed on Chorionic villous sample (CVS) done for prenatal 
      diagnosis of DMD, and CVS and non-informative family members were excluded from 
      the study. RESULTS: In carriers of DMD, the sensitivity and negative predictive 
      value of SCK were 33.3%, and specificity and positive predictive were 100% with 
      diagnostic efficiency of 50%. In affected cases of DMD the sensitivity and 
      negative predictive value of SCK were 100%, and specificity and positive 
      predictive were 91% and 88.8% respectively and diagnostic efficiency of 94.1%. 
      CONCLUSION: The SCK is an excellent screening test for affected cases of DMD. For 
      carrier identification we have to resort on PCR analysis so as to provide safer 
      diagnostic tool for genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis.

TI  - Gene diagnosis for nine Chinese patients with DMD/BMD by multiplex 
      ligation-dependent probe amplification and prenatal diagnosis for one of them.
PG  - 380-6

AB  - This study aims to perform gene diagnosis for nine patients with Duchenne/Becker 
      muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) and their parents with multiplex ligation-dependent 
      probe amplification (MLPA), and to carry out prenatal gene diagnosis for one of 
      them. Genomic DNA of the peripheral blood and fetal amniotic fluid cell was 
      extracted from the pedigrees' members with DMD/BMD. Gene diagnosis was performed 
      for theses pedigrees' members using a SALSA KIT. Short tandem repeats (STR) 
      genotyping and X-linkage analysis were performed for the pedigree members of the 
      fetus, which was used in the prenatal diagnosis. MLPA analysis results show that 
      five of nine patients (DMD-1, DMD-2, DMD-4, DMD-8, and DMD-9) with DMD/BMD were 
      found to have several hemizygous exon deletions in the dystrophin gene. The other 
      patients and the fetus did not have any hemizygous deletion or duplication of any 
      exons. The genomic DNA of the fetus was not contaminated by his mother's DNA as 
      identified by STR genotyping. In addition, X-linkage analysis results show that 
      the only X chromosome of the fetus comes from one of his mother's normal X 
      chromosomes. Combined with STR genotyping and X-linkage analysis, MLPA is a 
      convenient, highly effective and reliable gene diagnosis technique for congenital 
      genetic disease.

TI  - Deletional mutations of dystrophin gene and carrier detection in eastern India.
PG  - 1007-12
LID - 10.1007/s12098-009-0214-y [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the pattern of deletions of the dystrophin gene, the 
      major class of mutations among the Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy 
      patients of eastern India and to analyze the carrier frequency of the female 
      members of the proband's family. METHODS: Deletional mutations occurring in 
      patients have been characterized by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Carrier 
      state of mothers and sisters of probands were analyzed by either of two methods: 
      1) typing polymorphic short tandem repeat markers in or around the regions of 
      deletion, by radioactive polymerase chain reaction and 2) quantitative real time 
      amplification of the region of deletion. RESULTS: Deletions were detected in 67 
      (62.04%) out of 108 male patients, about 76.12% of these being localized in the 
      central hot spot region of the gene, i.e., between exon 42 to exon 53 and 17.91% 
      at the proximal hot spot i.e., between exon 1 to exon 20. In the present study 
      were found 43 types of deletions, out of which 25 (58%) were new deletions, which 
      were not described earlier among the Indian patients. Distribution pattern of 
      deletions in different hot spot regions has been compared with that of other 
      countries and statistical analysis reveals significant difference between 
      countries (p<0.001). Correlation of the pattern of deletion with clinical 
      phenotype of patients has been discussed. Interesting case of germline mosaicism 
      and its implications in counseling has also been discussed. CONCLUSION: About 
      half the mothers of affected probands were not carriers of the deletion, 
      underscoring the need to use real time techniques for carrier detection.

      by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification.
PG  - 23-30
LID - 10.1089/gtmb.2008.0059 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To verify whether dystrophin gene mutations among Chinese patients feature 
      different types and frequencies from other populations. METHODS: Multiplex 
      ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in combination with multiplex PCR 
      (mPCR) and/or short tandem repeat (STR)-based linkage analysis were applied in a 
      large series of Chinese families affected with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) 
      or Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). There were a total of 19 cases seeking 
      prenatal diagnosis during their second pregnancies. RESULTS: Of the 59 family 
      trios (51 with DMD and 8 with BMD), 40 were found to have carried various 
      mutations of the dystrophin gene. In addition to deletions and duplications 
      within the mutational hotspots identified by both methods, 10 mutations missed by 
      mPCR were detected by MLPA, among which at least 3 were of rare types. Combined 
      MLPA and linkage analysis also achieved prenatal diagnoses in all of the 19 
      amniocentesis samples. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations of dystrophin gene among Chinese 
      patients showed a diverse spectrum, with similarity to as well as discrepancies 
      from other populations. For the comprehensive coverage of all exons of the 
      dystrophin gene, MLPA should be the method of choice for initial screening of 
      DMD/BMD patients. When combined with STR-based analysis, it can achieve diagnosis 
      in as much as 70-80% of all referred cases.

TI  - Characterization of deletion breakpoints in patients with dystrophinopathy 
      carrying a deletion of exons 45-55 of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene.
PG  - 127-30
LID - 10.1038/jhg.2008.8 [doi]
AB  - Deletion of exons 45-55 (del45-55) in the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene (DMD) 
      has gained particular interest in the field of molecular therapy, because it 
      causes a milder phenotype than DMD, and therefore, may represent a good candidate 
      for the goal of a multiple exon-skipping strategy. We have precisely 
      characterized deletion breakpoints in three patients with del45-55 in DMD. Two of 
      them were young adult males of the X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype, and 
      the third patient revealed the mild Becker muscular dystrophy phenotype of late 
      onset. The deletion breakpoints differed among patients. The deletion started at 
      nt 226 604, 231 518, 117 284 in intron 44, and ended at nt 64 994, 59 314, 71 806 
      in intron 55, respectively. Deletion junctions showed no significant homology 
      between the sequences adjacent to the distal and proximal end joints in these 
      patients. Deletion breakpoints were not primarily associated with any particular 
      sequence element, or with a matrix attachment region. However, there were several 
      palindromic sequences and short tandem repeats at or near the breakpoints. These 
      sequences, with a marked propensity to form secondary DNA structure 
      intermediates, may predispose local DNA to breakage and intragenic recombination 
      in these patients.

TI  - Macrophage-secreted factors enhance the in vitro expansion of DMD muscle 
      precursor cells while preserving their myogenic potential.
PG  - 55-62
LID - 10.1179/174313209X380865 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Autologous cell transplantation has been proposed as a possible 
      therapeutic approach for Duchenne dystrophy. In this approach, patients' muscle 
      precursor cells (mpcs) obtained from muscle biopsies would be expanded ex vivo, 
      genetically modified to restore dystrophin expression and then reimplanted in the 
      original donor. Such strategy would have the advantage of bypassing the immune 
      response problem, but on the other hand, it would require a large number of cells 
      because of the poor viability and mobility of transplanted myoblasts. Besides, 
      extensive multiplication of mpcs is difficult and can affect their myogenic 
      ability. Given the key role of inflammation in muscle regeneration, we set out to 
      verify if factors secreted by inflammatory cells could be used to improve in 
      vitro expansion of DMD-mpcs. METHODS: We have previously shown that a murine 
      macrophage conditioned medium (mMCM) could increase the in vitro proliferation 
      rate of rat and mouse mpcs. Here we tested the effect of mMCM on cultures of 
      human, dystrophin-deficient mpcs (DMD-mpcs). RESULTS: In the presence of mMCM, 
      DMD-mpcs displayed an increased proliferation rate, while at the same time, 
      maintaining their myogenicity after many in vitro passages. Expanded cells were 
      also injected in muscles of immuno-deficient mice, showing that they were also 
      able to participate in muscle regeneration within recipient muscles. DISCUSSION: 
      Using macrophagic factors, we were able to increase the amount of DMD-mpcs 
      obtainable after 38 days of culture by >7 x 10(3)-fold. These findings indicate 
      that macrophagic factors hold great potential for future use in cell 
      transplantation protocol.

TI  - Detection of deletions and duplications in the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene 
      by the molecular method MLPA in the first Argentine affected families.
PG  - 223-33
AB  - Deletions/duplications in the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene account for 
      60 to 70% of all alterations. A new technique, multiplex ligation-dependent probe 
      amplification (MLPA), has been described that allows the detection of large 
      genetic rearrangements by simultaneous amplification of up to 45 target 
      sequences. The present article is based on the diagnosis of the first Argentine 
      affected families by the application of MLPA. DNA samples from patients with and 
      without a previous diagnosis were included. MLPA assays were performed according 
      to manufacturer recommendations. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing 
      were performed when a single-exon deletion was detected. Results were analyzed 
      using the Gene Marker v1.6 and Sequencing Analysis v5.2 software. In the samples 
      with a previous diagnosis (as identified by short tandem repeat-polymerase chain 
      reaction analysis), MLPA confirmed in some samples the same deletion and detected 
      in others a larger deleted fragment. This enabled the prediction of the expected 
      male phenotype. One deletion and one duplication were detected in patients 
      without previous diagnosis. In this study, we investigated the applicability of 
      MLPA in our country. Our results showed a 100% confirmation of the deleted 
      fragments detected by short tandem repeat segregation analysis. Moreover, in some 
      cases, the MLPA assay was able to refine the breakpoints involved. In addition, 
      MLPA identified deletions/duplications in samples without previous diagnosis. In 
      comparison to the available diagnosis strategies in Argentina, MLPA is less 
      time-consuming, and spans the complete coding region of DMD. The application of 
      MLPA will improve the genetic diagnosis of DMD/Becker muscular dystrophy in our 
      country.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of multiple displacement amplification (MDA) in 
      preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for female carriers with Duchenne 
      muscular dystrophy (DMD). DESIGN: MDA was used to amplify a whole genome of 
      single cells. Following the setup on single cells, the test was applied in two 
      clinical cases of PGD. One mutant exon, six short tandem repeats (STR) markers 
      within the dystrophin gene, and amelogenin were incorporated into singleplex 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays on MDA products of single blastomeres. 
      SETTING: Center for reproductive medicine in First Affiliated Hospital, Sun 
      Yat-sen University, China. PATIENT(S): Two female carriers with a duplication of 
      exons 3-11 and a deletion of exons 47-50, respectively. INTERVENTION(S): The MDA 
      of single cells and fluorescent PCR assays for PGD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The 
      ability to analyze single blastomeres for DMD using MDA. RESULT(S): The protocol 
      setup previously allowed for the accurate diagnosis of each embryo. Two clinical 
      cases resulted in a healthy girl, which was the first successful clinical 
      application of MDA in PGD for DMD. CONCLUSION(S): We suggest that this protocol 
      is reliable to increase the accuracy of the PGD for DMD.

TI  - Mutation and haplotype analysis for Duchenne muscular dystrophy by single cell 
      multiple displacement amplification.
PG  - 431-6
AB  - Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder with 
      mutational heterogeneity. The scarcity of DNA from single cells in 
      preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for DMD limits comprehensive genetic 
      testing. Multiple displacement amplification (MDA) is reported to generate large 
      amounts of template and give the most complete coverage and unbiased 
      amplification to date. Here, we developed mutation and haplotype analysis in 
      conjunction with gender determination on MDA products of single cells providing a 
      generic approach that widens availability of PGD for female carriers with varied 
      mutations. MDA amplified with 98.5% success for single lymphocytes and 94.2% 
      success for single blastomeres, which was evaluated on 60 lymphocytes and 40 
      blastomeres. A total of six commonly mutant exons, eight short tandem repeat 
      markers within dystrophin gene and amelogenin were incorporated into subsequent 
      singleplex PCR assays. The mean allele dropout rate was 9.0% for single 
      lymphocytes and 25.5% for single blastomeres. None of the blank controls gave a 
      positive signal. Genotyping of each pedigree for three families provided 2-3 
      fully informative alleles per dystrophin haplotype besides specific mutant exons 
      and amelogenin. We suggest that this approach is reliable to identify non-carrier 
      female embryos other than unaffected male embryos and reduce the risk of 
      misdiagnosis.

TI  - Identify female carriers and de novo mutations in deletional Duchenne/Becker 
      muscular dystrophy families.
PG  - 206-12
AB  - By using multiple polymerase reaction (mPCR) and haploid analysis of 11 short 
      tandem repeats (STRs) in dystrophin gene locus to identify female carriers in 
      deletional DMD/BMD (Duchenne/Becker Muscular Dystrophy) families, valuable 
      information can be gathered for prenatal diagnosis. In this article, de novo 
      mutations were detected in two out of the four patients, and one of the four 
      female members was identified as an obligate DMD gene carrier based on the 
      haplotype analysis. Multiple PCR and STRs haploid linkage analysis are rapid, 
      accurate, objective methods to identify female member status, and well suited for 
      routine use in clinical laboratories engaged in DMD/BMD research for counseling, 
      gene diagnosis and prenatal diagnosis. During mPCR analysis, the amplicon of exon 
      45 showed different electrophoresis mobility in different kinds of gels. 
      Polyacrylamide Gels Electrophoresis (PAGE) was accurate and rapid for analyzing 
      the products of mPCR, but the mobility of different amplicons need to be 
      considered in data analysis.

PG  - 53-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) is an X-linked lethal 
      recessive disease caused by mutations in the dystrophy gene. There is no 
      efficient treatment for this serious and disabling disease. We established a 
      combination method to detect carriers and perform prenatal diagnosis. METHODS: In 
      our study, from 1994 to 2005, using a different combination of 5 methods, 
      including SRY gene amplification, multiplex PCR, multiplex Fluorescence PCR 
      capillary electrophoresis, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification 
      (MLPA) and linkage analysis of short tandem repeats (STR), 36 prenatal diagnosis 
      were performed for pregnancies at risk of having a DMD/BMD baby through 
      amniocentesis. RESULTS: Fourteen out of 21 male fetuses were found to be affected 
      and respective pregnancies were terminated. A combined diagnostic rate of 83% was 
      achieved for 30 cases with deletions, duplications, and non-deletion mutations 
      after tested by more than one method. CONCLUSION: Using a combined method, we can 
      diagnoses patients and carriers in DMD families, and perform prenatal diagnosis 
      for the risk fetus. MLPA provides a simple, rapid and accurate method for 
      deletions and duplications of all the 79 DMD exons. MLPA method for DMD diagnosis 
      is the first report in our country.

TI  - Molecular diagnosis of Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy by polymerase chain 
      reaction and microsatellite analysis.
PG  - 385-8
AB  - Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) are 
      X-linked recessive genetic disorders resulting from mutations in the dystrophin 
      gene. About two-thirds of the affected patients have large deletions or 
      duplications, which occur in the 5' and central region of the gene. The remaining 
      DMD/BMD cases show no deletions, so they cannot be easily identified by current 
      strategies. In these DMD/BMD families, a linkage analysis that involves DNA 
      markers of the flanking and intragenic dystrophin gene are necessary for carrier 
      and prenatal diagnosis. We analyzed eighteen deletion-prone exons of the gene by 
      a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in order to characterize the molecular defects 
      of the dystrophin gene in Korean DMD/BMD families. We also performed a linkage 
      analysis to assess the usefulness and application of six short tandem repeat 
      markers for molecular diagnosis in the families. We observed a deletion that 
      eliminated the exon 50. Also, a linkage analysis in the families with six short 
      tandem repeat (STR) markers showed heterozygosity at most of the STR markers. The 
      haplotype analysis was useful for detecting the carrier status. This study will 
      be helpful for a molecular diagnosis of DMD/BMD families in the Korean 
      population.

TI  - Is the 31 CAG repeat allele of the spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) gene locus 
      non-specifically associated with trinucleotide expansion diseases?
PG  - 201-5
AB  - A number of human hereditary neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders are 
      caused by the expansion of trinucleotide repeats within certain genes. The 
      molecular mechanisms that underlie these expansions are not yet known. We have 
      analyzed six trinucleotide repeat-containing loci [spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, 
      SCA3, SCA8), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), Huntington chorea (HD) 
      and fragile X syndrome (FRAXA)] in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients (n = 
      52). As controls, we analyzed two groups of subjects: healthy control subjects (n 
      =133), and a group of patients with non-triplet neuromuscular diseases (n = 68) 
      caused by point mutations, deletions or duplications (spinal muscular atrophy, 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 1A, hereditary neuropathy with liability to 
      pressure palsies, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy). Allele frequency 
      distributions for all tested loci were similar in these three groups with the 
      exception of the SCA1 locus. In DM1 patients, the SCA1 allele with 31 CAG repeats 
      account for 40.4% of all chromosomes tested, which is significantly higher than 
      in two other groups (11.3% in healthy controls and 6.6% in the group of 
      non-triplet diseased patients; P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). This is 
      consistent with our previous findings in HD patients. The absence of this 
      association in non-triplet diseases as well as in healthy controls could indicate 
      a possible role of this SCA1 allele with 31 repeats in triplet diseases. Here we 
      discuss a possible role of the SCA1 region in pathological trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions.

      short tandem repeat sequence polymorphism.
PG  - 242-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To type haplotypes among the patients, carriers and normal offspring 
      in a family of males with Becker muscular dystrophy in one generation by allelic 
      fragment length polymorphism analysis. METHODS: Deletion analysis of the patients 
      were performed using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of amplification 
      with 9 dystrophin exon primers. Intragenic short tandem repeat (STR) sequence 
      (STR44, STR45, STR49 and STR50) were amplified by PCR to analyse allelic fragment 
      length polymorphisms in the members of the family. RESULTS: The deletions of 
      exons 17, 19 and 45, as well as deletions of allelic fragments at the loci of 
      STR44 and STR45 were determined in the patients. Hemizygosity at those two loci 
      were detected and carrier status ascertained in the mother of the patients. The 
      normal haplotypes were typed in the sister of the patients. CONCLUSION: The 
      method of STR sequence polymorphism analysis can determine haplotypes at normal 
      status or at risk status. It would be used in prenatal diagnosis and carrier 
      detection in the families of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy.

TI  - Carrier detection in non-deletional Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy families 
      using polymorphic dinucleotide (CA) repeat loci of dystrophin gene.
PG  - 19-25
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis is of great 
      importance for families with one or more sons affected with Duchenne/Becker 
      muscular dystrophy (D/BMD). In about 35-40 per cent of these patients, the 
      causative mutation does not involve gross rearrangement in the structure of 
      dystrophin gene. In these non-deletional families, genetic counselling can be 
      provided only by linkage analysis. The aim of the present study was to determine 
      the carrier status of female relatives in north Indian families with 
      non-deletional D/BMD using highly polymorphic intragenic dinucleotide (CA) repeat 
      markers. METHODS: Six short tandem repeats (STRs) spanning 5' (1), central (4) 
      and 3' regions of the dystrophin gene were used to analyse 14 unrelated families 
      comprising 68 individuals with 12 female siblings at risk of being carriers. 
      RESULTS: Five female siblings inherited at risk STR haplotype, six inherited 
      normal haplotype and one had meiotic recombination. The intragenic recombinations 
      were observed in three families at the central region STR loci and in one family 
      between the proximal and central regions of the gene. INTERPRETATION & 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that at least 6 STR markers spanning 5', central 
      and 3' regions of the dystrophin gene are essential to ascertain one or more 
      informative loci and to rule out recombinations in non-deletional D/BMD families 
      for carrier analysis.

TI  - Non-homologous recombination between Alu and LINE-1 repeats caused a 430-kb 
      deletion in the dystrophin gene: a novel source of genomic instability.
PG  - 331-6
AB  - Although large deletions in the dystrophin gene have been identified in more than 
      two-thirds of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy patients, the molecular 
      mechanisms that lead to the generation of these deletions are largely unknown. 
      Here, Alu and LINE-1 (L1) repetitive elements were shown to be present at one or 
      other of the two ends, respectively, of a 430-kb deletion in the dystrophin gene. 
      The breakpoint of the deletion, which stretches from exons 2 to 7, was defined 
      more precisely by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) walking on introns 1 and 7. 
      Finally, the region containing the breakpoint was amplified as a fragment of more 
      than 10kb. Sequencing of the deletion endpoint revealed the presence of an Alu 
      sequence in intron 1, 25 kb downstream from the 3' end of exon 1 that was joined 
      directly to an L1 sequence in intron 7, 4.5kb downstream from the 3' end of exon 
      7. The deletion was calculated to be 430kb. To our knowledge, this is a novel 
      recombination event joining non-homologous Alu and L1 repeats, and is the largest 
      known intrachromosomal deletion that is thought to involve repetitive genetic 
      elements. Sequence characteristics around the breakpoint are discussed.

TI  - Application of capillary nongel sieving electrophoresis for gene analysis.
PG  - 1822-8
AB  - Capillary electrophoresis (CE) has proved to be a strong tool for DNA analysis 
      and has found abundant applications in the fields of restriction fragment sizing, 
      mutation screening, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product characterizing and 
      forensic identifying. CE may be the main alternative to slab gel electrophoresis. 
      Capillary nongel electrophoresis is the most favorable mode when aiming for this 
      purpose because of its advantages of long lifetime, easy operation, good 
      reproducibility, and low expense. In this paper, a new kind of sieving matrix, 
      with mannitol as the additive for capillary electrophoresis, as well as related 
      methods and their application for gene analysis were reported. Nine DNA fragments 
      amplified by multiplex PCR from a normal dystrophin gene were well separated by 
      this system. Three different deletions were found in Duchenne muscular dystrophy 
      (DMD) patients. Three to four copies of the sex-determination region of the Y 
      chromosome (SRY) gene, as well as the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, could 
      be detected in mixed samples. The frequencies of short tandem repeats (STR) in 
      PAH genes was analyzed in 61 normal Chinese individuals and 6 phenylketonuria 
      families. One case of prenatal gene diagnosis was performed. By using this 
      matrix, CE coupled with reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), the analysis of the 
      alternative splicing expression pattern of the fragile X mental retardation 1 
      (FMR1) gene in adult lung tissue was achieved.

      DMD BMD families (9 familial and 6 sporadic) were evaluated on STR, pedigree and 
      serum creatine kinase (SCK) data. From the 36 females at risk of being carriers 
      (not including 8 obligate carriers), results of STR analysis were compatible with 
      carrier status in 7 and not compatible in 20. In 9 females, no information 
      regarding carriership was derived from the STR analysis. Prenatal diagnosis is 
      now possible on the carrier females. Previously identified deletions in the 
      central part of the gene were confirmed by STR analysis in 3 families. Five new 
      alleles were identified in Argentine individuals; allele frequencies differed 
      from those of North American people. Results derived from this study are useful 
      for carrier detection and genetic counseling in DMD/BMD. One case of probable 
      mosaicism in an unaffected father was detected on a pedigree basis in a family 
      with DMD patients.

TI  - Molecular analysis of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene in Spanish 
      individuals: deletion detection and familial diagnosis.
PG  - 182-7
AB  - Deletion studies were performed in 26 Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients 
      through amplification of nine different exons by multiplex polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR). DNA from paraffin-embedded muscle biopsies was analyzed in 12 of 
      the 26 patients studied. Optimization of this technique is of great utility 
      because it enables analysis of material stored in pathology archives. PCR 
      deletion detection, useful in DMD-affected boys, is problematic in determining 
      the carrier state in female relatives. For this reason, to perform familial 
      linkage diagnosis, we made use of a dinucleotide repeat polymorphism (STRP, or 
      short tandem repeat polymorphism) located in intron 49 of the gene. We designed a 
      new pair of primers that enabled the detection of 22 different alleles in 
      relatives in the 14 DMD families studied. The use of this marker allowed familial 
      diagnosis in 11 of the 14 DMD families and detection of de novo deletions in 3 of 
      the probands.

TI  - High-resolution DNA Fiber-FISH for genomic DNA mapping and colour bar-coding of 
      large genes.
PG  - 831-6
AB  - We have applied two-colour fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to DNA 
      fibers and combined it with digital imaging microscopy for the mapping of large 
      cosmid contigs. The technique was validated using a set of unique plasmids and a 
      cosmid contig both originating from the thyroglobulin (Tg) gene and previously 
      mapped by restriction analysis. The resolution proved to be close to the 
      theoretical lower limit of approximately 1 kb, ranging > or = 400 kb. 
      Subsequently a 400 kb cosmid contig derived from a DMD-YAC was directly mapped by 
      Fiber-FISH. The resulting map is in full agreement with the restriction map. 
      Two-colour Fiber-FISH mapping thus showed to be capable for accurately sizing 
      gaps and overlaps, and to identify chimeric or repeat sequence containing cosmids 
      across a 400 kb region at once. The generated 400 kb 'colour bar-code' was 
      subsequently used to map two DMD deletion breakpoints in patient DNA with an 
      accuracy of 1-2 kb. The results underscore the value of this method for the 
      delineation of chromosomal rearrangements for positional cloning and single 
      patient clinical studies.

TI  - Two polymorphic dinucleotide repeats in intron 44 of the dystrophin gene.
PG  - 475-7
AB  - Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most common and severe X-linked 
      disorders with an incidence of approximately 1 in 3500 newborn males. In more 
      than 60% of DMD patients, deletions of part or all of the dystrophin gene have 
      been shown. Despite this, carrier detection still poses a problem in some cases, 
      because of the enormous size of the gene and the lack of sufficient numbers of 
      informative markers. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of two 
      additional microsatellite markers (IVS44SK12 and IVS44SK21) in intron 44 of the 
      dystrophin gene. Both markers are useful for carrier detection either by indirect 
      DNA analysis or by direct proof of loss of heterozygosity.
