AB  - The tissue environment governs vascular remodeling, a key determinant of 
      collateral circulation (CC) in ischemic disease, yet the mechanisms driving CC in 
      adults remain unclear. Plasma profiling from patients with peripheral artery 
      disease (PAD) and ischemic murine muscle revealed dysregulated lipid metabolism, 
      including elevated APOA1 binding protein (AIBP), with levels positively 
      correlating with PAD severity. Myeloid cells enriched at CC sites increased AIBP 
      expression postischemia. Genetic deletion of AIBP expanded CXCR4(+) capillary 
      endothelial cells (CECs) with stemlike and proliferative properties that 
      remodeled into functional collaterals, a process blocked by CXCR4 inhibition. 
      Mechanistically, AIBP bound the endocytic receptor LRP2 to promote endothelial 
      uptake of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated miR-223, a repressor of 
      CXCR4. Disruption of this AIBP-LRP2-HDL-miR-223 axis restored CXCR4 and rescued 
      CC growth. These findings define a two-phase mechanism in which stemlike CECs 
      first expand and then transition to arterial fates, establishing a therapeutic 
      strategy for revascularization in ischemic vascular disease.

AB  - Repeat expansions cause at least 50 hereditary disorders, including Friedreich 
      ataxia and other diseases known to cause mitochondrial dysfunction. We identified 
      a patient with NAXE-related mitochondrial encephalopathy and novel biallelic 
      GGGCC repeat expansion as long as ~200 repeats in the NAXE promoter region using 
      long-read sequencing. In addition to a marked reduction in the RNA and protein, 
      we found a marked reduction in nascent RNA in the promoter using native 
      elongating transcript-cap analysis of gene expression (NET-CAGE), suggesting 
      transcriptional suppression. Accordingly, CpG hypermethylation was observed in 
      the repeat region. Genetic analyses determined that homozygosity in the patient 
      was due to maternal chromosome 1 uniparental disomy (UPD). We assessed short 
      variants within NAXE including the repeat region in the undiagnosed mitochondrial 
      encephalopathy cohort of 242 patients. This study identified the GGGCC repeat 
      expansion causing a mitochondrial disease and suggests that UPD could 
      significantly contribute to homozygosity for rare repeat-expanded alleles.
