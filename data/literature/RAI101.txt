AB  - Tandem nucleotide repeat (TNR) expansions, particularly the CNG nucleotide 
      configuration, are associated with a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. In 
      this study, we aimed to identify novel unstable CNG repeat loci associated with 
      the neurogenetic disorder spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). Using a computational 
      approach, 15,069 CNG repeat loci in the coding and noncoding regions of the human 
      genome were identified. Based on the feature selection criteria (repeat length 
      >10 and functional location of repeats), we selected 52 repeats for further 
      analysis and evaluated the repeat length variability in 100 control subjects. A 
      subset of 19 CNG loci observed to be highly variable in control subjects was 
      selected for subsequent analysis in 100 individuals with SCA. The genes with 
      these highly variable repeats also exhibited higher gene expression levels in the 
      brain according to the tissue expression dataset (GTEx). No pathogenic expansion 
      events were identified in patient samples, which is a limitation given the size 
      of the patient group examined; however, these loci contain potential risk alleles 
      for expandability. Recent studies have implicated GLS, RAI1, GIPC1, MED15, EP400, 
      MEF2A, and CNKSR2 in neurological diseases, with GLS, GIPC1, MED15, RAI1, and 
      MEF2A sharing the same repeat loci reported in this study. This finding validates 
      the approach of evaluating repeat loci in different populations and their 
      possible implications for human pathologies.

TI  - Pentanucleotide Repeat Insertions in RAI1 Cause Benign Adult Familial Myoclonic 
      Epilepsy Type 8.
PG  - 164-172

AB  - BACKGROUND: Benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy (BAFME) is an autosomal 
      dominant disorder characterized by cortical tremors and seizures. Six types of 
      BAFME, all caused by pentanucleotide repeat expansions in different genes, have 
      been reported. However, several other BAFME cases remain with no molecular 
      diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: We aim to characterize clinical features and identify the 
      mutation causing BAFME in a large Malian family with 10 affected members. 
      METHODS: Long-read whole genome sequencing, repeat-primed polymerase chain 
      reaction and RNA studies were performed. RESULTS: We identified TTTTA repeat 
      expansions and TTTCA repeat insertions in intron 4 of the RAI1 gene that 
      co-segregated with disease status in this family. TTTCA repeats were absent in 
      200 Malian controls. In the affected individuals, we found a read with only nine 
      TTTCA repeat units and somatic instability. The RAI1 repeat expansions cause the 
      only BAFME type in which the disease-causing repeats are in a gene associated 
      with a monogenic disorder in the haploinsufficiency state (ie, Smith-Magenis 
      syndrome [SMS]). Nevertheless, none of the Malian patients exhibited symptoms 
      related to SMS. Moreover, leukocyte RNA levels of RAI1 in six Malian BAFME 
      patients were no different from controls. CONCLUSIONS: These findings establish a 
      new type of BAFME, BAFME8, in an African family and suggest that 
      haploinsufficiency is unlikely to be the main pathomechanism of BAFME. (c) 2023

TI  - Expansion of testing, isolation, quarantine, e-health and telemonitoring 
      strategies in socioeconomically vulnerable neighbourhoods at primary healthcare 
      in the fight against COVID-19 in Brazil: a study protocol of a multisite testing 
      intervention using a mixed method approach.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The key tools for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 and reducing 
      its transmission include testing, quarantine and isolation, as well as 
      telemonitoring. Primary healthcare (PHC) can be essential in increasing access to 
      these tools. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to implement and 
      expand an intervention consisting of COVID-19 testing, isolation, quarantine and 
      telemonitoring (TQT) strategies and other prevention measures at PHC services in 
      highly socioeconomically vulnerable neighbourhoods of Brazil. METHODS AND 
      ANALYSIS: This study will implement and expand COVID-19 testing in PHC services 
      in two large Brazilian capital cities: Salvador and Rio de Janeiro. Qualitative 
      formative research was conducted to understand the testing context in the 
      communities and at PCH services. The TQT strategy was structured in three 
      subcomponents: (1) training and technical support for tailoring the work 
      processes of health professional teams, (2) recruitment and demand creation 
      strategies and (3) TQT. To evaluate this intervention, we will conduct an 
      epidemiological study with two stages: (1) a cross-sectional sociobehavioural 
      survey among individuals from these two communities covered by PHC services, 
      presenting symptoms associated with COVID-19 or being a close contact of a 
      patient with COVID-19, and (2) a cohort of those who tested positive, collecting 
      clinical data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The WHO Ethics Research Committee (ERC) 
      (#CERC.0128A and #CERC.0128B) and each city's local ERC approved the study 
      protocol (Salvador, ISC/UFBA: #53844121.4.1001.5030; and Rio de Janeiro, 
      INI/Fiocruz: #53844121.4.3001.5240, ENSP/Fiocruz: #53844121.4.3001.5240 and 
      SMS/RJ #53844121.4.3002.5279). Findings will be published in scientific journals 
      and presented at meetings. In addition, informative flyers and online campaigns 
      will be developed to communicate study findings to participants, members of 
      communities and key stakeholders.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is one of the most common 
      autosomal dominant ataxias in the world. Several reports revealed that CAG 
      repeats in some polyQ-containing genes may affect the age at onset (AAO) of 
      patients with SCA2, however, little studies were conducted among Chinese patients 
      with SCA2. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of CAG repeats 
      on the AAO of patients with SCA2 in China. METHODS: A total of 119 patients with 
      SCA2 were enrolled and were divided into 2 groups according to their major 
      phenotype: 17 patients from 9 families with Parkinson's syndrome were grouped as 
      the Parkinson's disease-SCA2 (PD-SAC2); 91 patients from 66 SCA2 families and 11 
      sporadic SCA2 patients were grouped as the ataxia-SCA2 (A-SCA2). Blood samples 
      were obtained from the subjects, and the CAG repeat length in ATXN2 and other 
      (CAG)(n)-containing genes was screened using fluorescent PCR. The Spearman's rank 
      correlation between the CAG repeat length in (CAG)(n)-containing genes and AAO 
      was analyzed. Regression analysis was performed to investigate whether the CAG 
      repeat length could explain the variant of AAO. A t-test was used to compare the 
      difference of CAG repeat length in (CAG)(n)-containing genes between the PD-SAC2 
      and A-SCA2 groups. RESULTS: The CAG repeat length in the longer allele of ATXN2 
      was negatively correlated with AAO of SCA2 (R=-0.251, P<0.05), and the CAG repeat 
      length could explain 41.7% of the variation of AAO. AAO negatively correlated 
      with the CAG repeat length in the shorter allele of ATXN7 (R=-0.251, P=0.006) or 
      in the longer allele of TBP gene (R=-0.197, P=0.034). A tendency of delay in the 
      AAO was also observed in patients with SCA2 carrying the CAG repeat within the 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, and RAI1. In addition, we found that the CAG repeat 
      length in ATXN7 and ATXN2 between the A-SCA2 and the PD-SCA2 groups was 
      significantly different (both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The CAG repeat in ATXN2 is a 
      major genetic factor for the AAO of patients with SCA2 in China. The CAG repeat 
      length in ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, and RAI1 genes might be a potential factor 
      associated with the AAO of SCA2. The CAG repeat in ATXN7 might be a potential 
      factor affecting the Parkinson's syndrome in SCA2.

AB  - Snyder-Robinson syndrome (OMIM #309583) is a rare X-linked condition, caused by 
      mutation in the SMS gene (MIM *300105), characterized by a wide spectrum of 
      clinical signs including developmental delay, epilepsy, asthenic habitus, 
      dysmorphism, osteopenia, and renal or genital anomalies. Here we describe two 
      maternal half-brothers who both presented with severe neurodevelopmental delay, 
      seizures, hearing loss, facial dysmorphism, renal and ophthalmologic anomalies, 
      failure to thrive and premature death. A novel p.(Gly203Asp) variant was found at 
      the hemizygous state in the two boys, and an elevated Spermidine/Spermine ratio 
      confirmed the diagnosis of Snyder-Robinson syndrome. One of the brothers 
      presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, with jejunal stenosis, enteral feeding 
      intolerance, failure to thrive due to a dysfunctional gastrointestinal system, 
      cholestasis and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Although more studies will be 
      needed to understand its mechanisms, this observation lends further support to 
      the possibility of severe digestive involvement in Snyder Robinson syndrome.

TI  - Expansion and Conservation of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters in Pathogenic 
      Pyrenophora spp.
LID - 10.3390/toxins12040242 [doi]
LID - 242
AB  - Pyrenophora is a fungal genus responsible for a number of major cereal diseases. 
      Although fungi produce many specialised or secondary metabolites for defence and 
      interacting with the surrounding environment, the repertoire of specialised 
      metabolites (SM) within Pyrenophora pathogenic species remains mostly uncharted. 
      In this study, an in-depth comparative analysis of the P. teres f. teres, P teres 
      f. maculata and P. tritici-repentis potential to produce SMs, based on in silico 
      predicted biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), was conducted using genome 
      assemblies from PacBio DNA reads. Conservation of BGCs between the Pyrenophora 
      species included type I polyketide synthases, terpene synthases and the first 
      reporting of a type III polyketide synthase in P teres f. maculata. P. teres 
      isolates exhibited substantial expansion of non-ribosomal peptide synthases 
      relative to P. tritici-repentis, hallmarked by the presence of tailoring 
      cis-acting nitrogen methyltransferase domains. P. teres isolates also possessed 
      unique non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS)-indole and indole BGCs, while a P. 
      tritici-repentis phytotoxin BGC for triticone production was absent in P. teres. 
      These differences highlight diversification between the pathogens that reflects 
      their different evolutionary histories, host adaption and lifestyles.

TI  - Kondo-Induced Giant Isotropic Negative Thermal Expansion.
PG  - 125701
LID - 10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.125701 [doi]
AB  - Negative thermal expansion is an unusual phenomenon appearing in only a handful 
      of materials, but pursuit and mastery of the phenomenon holds great promise for 
      applications across disciplines and industries. Here we report use of x-ray 
      spectroscopy and diffraction to investigate the 4f-electronic properties in 
      Y-doped SmS and employ the Kondo volume collapse model to interpret the results. 
      Our measurements reveal an unparalleled decrease of the bulk Sm valence by over 
      20% at low temperatures in the mixed-valent golden phase, which we show is caused 
      by a strong coupling between an emergent Kondo lattice state and a large 
      isotropic volume change. The amplitude and temperature range of the negative 
      thermal expansion appear strongly dependent on the Y concentration and the 
      associated chemical disorder, providing control over the observed effect. This 
      finding opens avenues for the design of Kondo lattice materials with tunable, 
      giant, and isotropic negative thermal expansion.

TI  - (CAG)(n) loci as genetic modifiers of age at onset in patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 from mainland China.
PG  - 1130-1136
LID - 10.1111/ene.13954 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The expanded repeat length in ATXN1 negatively correlates 
      with age at onset (AAO) of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) but can explain 
      only part of it, indicating that other factors affect AAO. Some studies have 
      explored the influence of non-causative CAG repeats on the AAO of SCA patients. 
      However, studies on Chinese SCA1 patients regarding candidate modifier factors 
      involved in the variability in AAO are rare. METHODS: In all, 152 Chinese SCA1 
      patients who were genotyped for ATXN1 and nine other (CAG)(n) -containing genes 
      were enrolled. Regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of the 
      expanded allele of ATXN1 (linear and quadratic effects) on AAO. Then, different 
      models were used to explore the modulatory effect of nine other (CAG)(n) 
      -containing genes. RESULTS: Our results verified the negative effect of the 
      expanded allele in ATXN1 by regression analysis. Some (CAG)(n) -containing genes 
      including TBP, ATN1 and HTT modified AAO with variance ranging from 0.8% to 3.8% 
      and tended to decrease or delay AAO. However, no modifier effects of ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, KCNN3, RAI1 and normal ATXN1 alleles in trans were 
      detected. CONCLUSION: By using interaction analyses, TBP, ATN1 and HTT were 
      determined to have modifying effects. Our study revealed that differences in 
      modulation may be due to ethnic and geographic diversity across different 
      populations. Furthermore, the variability of AAO was not completely explained by 
      the genetic modifiers examined here, suggesting that other genetic or 
      environmental factors are involved in these diseases.

TI  - Comparative genomics of Botryosphaeria dothidea and B. kuwatsukai, causal agents 
      of apple ring rot, reveals both species expansion of pathogenicity-related genes 
      and variations in virulence gene content during speciation.

AB  - Ring rot, one of the most destructive diseases of apple worldwide, is caused 
      primarily by Botryosphaeria dothidea and B. kuwatsukai. Here, we sequenced the 
      genomes of B. dothidea strain PG45 (44.3 Mb with 5.12 % repeat rate) and B. 
      kuwatsukai epitype strain PG2 (48.0 Mb with 13.02 % repeat rate), and conducted a 
      comparative analysis of these two genomes, as well as other sequenced fungal 
      genomes, in order to understand speciation and distinctive patterns of evolution 
      of pathogenicity-related genes. Pair-wise genome alignments revealed that the two 
      species are highly syntenic (96.74 % average sequence identity). Both species 
      encode a significant number of pathogenicity-related genes, e.g. carbohydrate 
      active enzymes (CAZYs), plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs), secondary 
      metabolites (SMs) biosynthetic enzymes, cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), and 
      secreted peptidases, in comparison to all additional sequenced fungal species 
      involved in various life-styles. The number of pathogenicity-related genes in B. 
      dothidea and B. kuwatsukai is higher than other genomes of Botryosphaeriaceae 
      pathogens (Macrophomina phaseolina and Neofusicoccum parvum), suggesting a 
      secondary round of Botryosphaeria-lineage expansion in the family. There were, 
      however, also significant differences in the genomes of the two Botryosphaeria 
      species. Botryosphaeria kuwatsukai, which infects only apple and pear, apparently 
      lost a set of SMs genes, CAZYs and PCWDEs, possibly as a result of host 
      specialization. Botryosphaeria kuwatsukai contained significantly more 
      transposable elements and higher value of repeat induced point (RIP) index than 
      B. dothidea. Our results will be instrumental in understanding how both 
      phytopathogens interact with their plant hosts and in designing efficient 
      strategies for disease control and molecular breeding to help ensure global apple 
      production and food security.

TI  - Derivation, Expansion, and Motor Neuron Differentiation of Human-Induced 
      Pluripotent Stem Cells with Non-Integrating Episomal Vectors and a Defined 
      Xenogeneic-free Culture System.
PG  - 1589-1600

AB  - Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from patient-derived somatic 
      cells provides the opportunity for model development in order to study 
      patient-specific disease states with the potential for drug discovery. However, 
      use of lentivirus and exposure of iPSCs to animal-derived products limit their 
      therapeutic utility and affect lineage differentiation and subsequent downstream 
      functionality of iPSC derivatives. Within the context of this study, we describe 
      a simple and practical protocol enabling the efficient reprogramming of 
      terminally differentiated adult fibroblasts into integration-free human iPSCs 
      (hiPSCs) using a combination of episomal plasmids with small molecules (SMs). 
      Using this approach, there was a 10-fold increase in reprogramming efficiency 
      over single plasmid vector-based methods. We obtained approximately 100 iPSCs 
      colonies from 1 x 10(5) human adult dermal fibroblasts (HADFs) and achieved 
      approximately 0.1% reprogramming efficiencies. Concurrently, we developed a 
      highly conducive culture system using xeno-free media and human vitronectin. The 
      resulting hiPSCs were free of DNA integration and had completely lost episomal 
      vectors, maintained long-term self-renewal, featured a normal karyotype, 
      expressed pluripotent stem cell markers, and possessed the capability of 
      differentiating into components of all three germ layers in vivo. Finally, we 
      demonstrate that the integration-free hiPSCs could be differentiated into motor 
      neurons under xeno-free culture conditions. This induction method will promote 
      the derivation of patient-specific integration-free and xeno-free iPSCs and 
      improve the strategy for motor neuron derivation. Our approach provides a useful 
      tool for human disease models, drug screen, and clinical applications.

LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.36116 [doi]
AB  - Snyder-Robinson syndrome is a rare form of X-linked intellectual disability 
      caused by mutations in the spermine synthase (SMS) gene, and characterized by 
      intellectual disability, thin habitus with diminished muscle mass, osteoporosis, 
      kyphoscoliosis, facial dysmorphism (asymmetry, full lower lip), long great toes, 
      and nasal or dysarthric speech. Physical signs seem to evolve from childhood to 
      adulthood. We describe the first Italian patient with Snyder-Robinson syndrome 
      and a novel nonsense mutation in SMS (c.200G>A; p.G67X). Apart from the typical 
      features of the syndrome, the index patient presented with an ectopic right 
      kidney and epilepsy from the first year of age that was characterized by focal 
      motor seizures and negative myoclonus. The clinical and molecular evaluation of 
      this family and the review of the literature expand the phenotype of 
      Snyder-Robinson syndrome to include myoclonic or myoclonic-like seizures 
      (starting even in the first years of life) and renal abnormalities in affected 
      males.

TI  - Complex chromosome 17p rearrangements associated with low-copy repeats in two 
      patients with congenital anomalies.
PG  - 697-709
AB  - Recent molecular cytogenetic data have shown that the constitution of complex 
      chromosome rearrangements (CCRs) may be more complicated than previously thought. 
      The complicated nature of these rearrangements challenges the accurate 
      delineation of the chromosomal breakpoints and mechanisms involved. Here, we 
      report a molecular cytogenetic analysis of two patients with congenital anomalies 
      and unbalanced de novo CCRs involving chromosome 17p using high-resolution 
      array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) and fluorescent in situ 
      hybridization (FISH). In the first patient, a 4-month-old boy with developmental 
      delay, hypotonia, growth retardation, coronal synostosis, mild hypertelorism, and 
      bilateral club feet, we found a duplication of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 
      type 1A and Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) chromosome regions, inverted insertion 
      of the Miller-Dieker lissencephaly syndrome region into the SMS region, and two 
      microdeletions including a terminal deletion of 17p. The latter, together with a 
      duplication of 21q22.3-qter detected by array CGH, are likely the unbalanced 
      product of a translocation t(17;21)(p13.3;q22.3). In the second patient, an 
      8-year-old girl with mental retardation, short stature, microcephaly and mild 
      dysmorphic features, we identified four submicroscopic interspersed 17p 
      duplications. All 17 breakpoints were examined in detail by FISH analysis. We 
      found that four of the breakpoints mapped within known low-copy repeats (LCRs), 
      including LCR17pA, middle SMS-REP/LCR17pB block, and LCR17pC. Our findings 
      suggest that the LCR burden in proximal 17p may have stimulated the formation of 
      these CCRs and, thus, that genome architectural features such as LCRs may have 
      been instrumental in the generation of these CCRs.

TI  - Uncommon deletions of the Smith-Magenis syndrome region can be recurrent when 
      alternate low-copy repeats act as homologous recombination substrates.
PG  - 75-81
AB  - Several homologous recombination "hotspots," or sites of positional preference 
      for strand exchanges, associated with recurrent deletions and duplications have 
      been reported within large low-copy repeats (LCRs). Recently, such a hotspot was 
      identified in patients with the Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) common deletion of 
      approximately 4 Mb or a reciprocal duplication within the KER gene cluster of the 
      SMS-REP LCRs, in which 50% of analyzed strand exchanges resulting in deletion and 
      23% of those resulting in duplication occurred. Here, we report an additional 
      recombination hotspot within LCR17pA and LCR17pD, which serve as alternative 
      substrates for nonallelic homologous recombination that results in large 
      (approximately 5 Mb) deletions of 17p11.2, which include the SMS region. Using 
      polymerase-chain-reaction mapping of somatic cell hybrid lines, we refined the 
      breakpoints of six deletions within these LCRs. Sequence analysis of the 
      recombinant junctions revealed that all six strand exchanges occurred within a 
      524-bp interval, and four of them occurred within an AluSq/x element. This 
      interval represents only 0.5% of the 124-kb stretch of 98.6% sequence identity 
      between LCR17pA and LCR17pD. A search for potentially stimulating sequence motifs 
      revealed short AT-rich segments flanking the recombination hotspot. Our findings 
      indicate that alternative LCRs can mediate rearrangements, resulting in 
      haploinsufficiency of the SMS critical region, and reimplicate homologous 
      recombination as a major mechanism for genomic disorders.

TI  - Association of moderate polyglutamine tract expansions in the slow 
      calcium-activated potassium channel type 3 with ataxia.
PG  - 1649-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: The small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel gene 
      (hSKCa3) contains 2 CAG repeats, 1 of which is highly polymorphic. Although this 
      repeat is not pathologically expanded in patients with schizophrenia, some 
      studies have suggested an allelic association with schizophrenia. CAG expansions 
      in other genes such as the alpha1 subunit of a brain-specific P/Q-type calcium 
      channel gene cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, whereas the length of the CAG 
      repeat in the RAI1 gene modifies the age of onset of spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      2. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate expansions in the hSKCa3 polyglutamine domain as 
      causative for ataxia, and to study the association between the length of the 
      polyglutamine repeat and the presence of ataxia. METHODS: We analyzed this repeat 
      in 122 patients with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, or sporadic ataxia, 
      and compared allele distribution with 750 alleles seen in 2 healthy control 
      groups and 172 alleles in patients with Parkinson disease. RESULTS: The 
      distribution of alleles in ataxia patients and controls was significantly 
      different by Wilcoxon rank test (P <.001). Twenty-two or more polyglutamine 
      tracts were more common in ataxia patients compared with controls by chi2 
      analysis (P<.001). CONCLUSION: Longer stretches of polyglutamines in a human 
      potassium channel are not causative for ataxia, but they are associated with the 
      presence of ataxia. There is no association with the presence of Parkinson 
      disease.

TI  - CAG repeat length in RAI1 is associated with age at onset variability in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2).
PG  - 1753-8
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by 
      the expansion of a polymorphic (CAG)(n) tract, which is translated into an 
      expanded polyglutamine tract in the ataxin-2 protein. Although repeat length and 
      age at disease onset are inversely related, approximately 50% of the age at onset 
      variance in SCA2 remains unexplained. Other familial factors have been proposed 
      to account for at least part of this remaining variance in the polyglutamine 
      dis-orders. The ability of polyglutamine tracts to interact with each other, as 
      well as the presence of intra-nuclear inclusions in other polyglutamine 
      disorders, led us to hypothesize that other CAG-containing proteins may interact 
      with expanded ataxin-2 and affect the rate of protein accumulation, and thus 
      influence age at onset. To test this hypothesis, we used step-wise multiple 
      linear regression to examine 10 CAG-containing genes for possible influences on 
      SCA2 age at onset. One locus, RAI1, contributed an additional 4.1% of the 
      variance in SCA2 age at onset after accounting for the effect of the SCA2 
      expanded repeat. This locus was further studied in SCA3/Machado-Joseph disease 
      (MJD), but did not have an effect on SCA3/MJD age at onset. This result 
      implicates RAI1 as a possible contributor to SCA2 neurodegeneration and raises 
      the possibility that other CAG-containing proteins may play a role in the 
      pathogenesis of other polyglutamine disorders.

TI  - Nuclear protein binding and functional activity of a variant insulin gene found 
      in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 218-27
AB  - In a subset of patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus an 8-base 
      pair (bp) repeat was found from -322 to -315 in the 5'-flanking region of the 
      insulin gene. This 8-bp repeat is inserted into a sequence that is highly 
      homologous to a sequence motif, called PISCES (pancreatic islet cell-specific 
      enhancer sequences), found within cell-specific enhancer elements of the rat 
      insulin I (Ins-E1, from -332 to -285), rat glucagon (Glu-G3) and rat somatostatin 
      (SMS-UE) genes. The PISCES motif confers pancreatic islet-specific activity and 
      is recognized by an islet-specific transcription factor (PISCES-BP). The 
      consequences on functional activity and on protein binding of the 8-bp repeat 
      sequence in the human insulin promoter was investigated. When fused to a reporter 
      gene and transiently transfected into an insulin-producing islet cell line, the 
      8-bp repeat decreased basal transcriptional activity of the human insulin 
      promoter (from -366 to +42) whereas the induction of promoter activity by cAMP 
      was unaffected. The isolated rat Ins-E1 element was sufficient to confer basal 
      transcriptional activity to a minimal promoter; the corresponding fragments of 
      the normal and variant human insulin genes (from -329 to -288), however, were 
      not. Using nuclear extracts in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, it was 
      found that PISCES-BP recognizes rat Ins-E1, but PISCES-BP binding to the 
      corresponding normal and variant human insulin promoter fragments was not 
      detectable and weak, respectively. However, a nuclear protein was found that 
      binds to the variant but not normal human sequence. These data suggest that the 
      8-bp repeat in the variant human insulin promoter found in patients with 
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus allows the binding of a nuclear protein 
      that interferes with promoter function.
