AB  - BACKGROUND: While most sporadic adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases have only 
      a minor monogenic component, given several recently identified late adult-onset 
      ataxia genes, the genetic burden may be substantial in sporadic adult-onset 
      ataxias. We report systematic mapping of the genetic landscape of sporadic 
      adult-onset ataxia in a well-characterised, multi-centre cohort, combining 
      several multi-modal genetic screening techniques, plus longitudinal natural 
      history data. METHODS: Systematic clinico-genetic analysis of a prospective 
      longitudinal multi-centre cohort of 377 consecutive patients with sporadic 
      adult-onset ataxia (SPORTAX cohort), including clinically defined sporadic 
      adult-onset ataxia of unknown aetiology (SAOA) (n = 229) and 'clinically probable 
      multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type' (MSA-C(cp)) (n = 148). Combined 
      GAA-FGF14 (SCA27B) and RFC1 repeat expansion screening with next-generation 
      sequencing (NGS) was complemented by natural history and plasma neurofilament 
      light chain analysis in key subgroups. FINDINGS: 85 out of 377 (22.5%) patients 
      with sporadic adult-onset ataxia carried a pathogenic or likely pathogenic 
      variant, thereof 67/229 (29.3%) patients with SAOA and 18/148 (12.2%) patients 
      meeting the MSA-C(cp) criteria. This included: 45/377 (11.9%) patients with 
      GAA-FGF14(>/=250) repeat expansions (nine with MSA-C(cp)), 17/377 (4.5%) patients 
      with RFC1 repeat expansions (three with MSA-C(cp)), and 24/377 (6.4%) patients 
      with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) identified by NGS (six with MSA-C(cp)). 
      Five patients (1.3%) were found to have two relevant genetic variants 
      simultaneously (dual diagnosis). INTERPRETATION: In this cohort of sporadic 
      adult-onset ataxia, a cohort less likely to have a monogenic cause, a substantial 
      burden of monogenic variants was identified, particularly GAA-FGF14 and RFC1 
      repeat expansions. This included a substantial share of patients meeting the 
      MSA-C(cp) criteria, suggesting a reduced specificity of this clinical diagnosis 
      and potential co-occurrence of MSA-C plus a second, independent genetic 
      condition. These findings have important implications for the genetic work-up and 
      counselling of patients with sporadic ataxia, even when presenting with MSA-like 
      features. With targeted treatments for genetic ataxias now on the horizon, these 
      findings highlight their potential utility for these patients. FUNDING: This work 
      was supported by the Clinician Scientist programme "PRECISE.net" funded by the 
      Else Kroner-Fresenius-Stiftung (to DM, AT, CW, OR, and MS), by the Deutsche 
      Forschungsgemeinschaft (as part of the PROSPAX project), and by the Canadian 
      Institutes of Health Research and the Fondation Groupe Monaco. Support was also 
      provided by Humboldt Research Fellowship for Postdocs and the Hertie-Network of 
      Excellence in Clinical Neuroscience and a Fellowship award from the Canadian 
      Institutes of Health Research.

LID - 10.5603/pjnns.103747 [doi]
AB  - Cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia syndrome 
      (CANVAS) is a late-onset, autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterised by the triad of cerebellar ataxia, bilateral vestibular areflexia, 
      and sensory neuropathy. First identified more than 30 years ago, its clinical 
      phenotype has since expanded to include chronic cough, dysautonomia, and pain, 
      with isolated neuronopathy reported in some cases. The discovery of biallelic 
      AAGGG repeat expansions in intron 2 of the RFC1 gene in 2019 established the 
      genetic basis for CANVAS, with the pathogenic expansions disrupting gene function 
      via secondary structures such as G-quadruplexes. Despite this breakthrough, the 
      precise pathophysiological mechanisms behind CANVAS remain elusive, necessitating 
      further research into the molecular, clinical, and genetic aspects of this 
      disease. This review consolidates the current understanding of CANVAS, 
      encompassing the expanding spectrum of RFC1-related disorders, clinical 
      manifestations, molecular underpinnings, and epidemiology, while exploring future 
      directions for diagnostics and therapeutic advancements.

TI  - Genetic and Clinical Features of 10 Families With Hereditary Sensory 
      Neuropathies.
PG  - e70020
LID - 10.1111/jns.70020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hereditary sensory neuropathies (HSNs) are a group of 
      genetically and clinically heterogeneous diseases. Our study aims to summarize 
      the genetic and clinical features of HSNs in 10 Chinese families. METHODS: 
      Clinical data from 10 families with HSNs were collected retrospectively. Genetic 
      screening was performed by whole exome sequencing (WES). Repeated-primed PCR and 
      capillary electrophoresis were performed for WES-negative patients to analyze 
      repeat expansions in RFC1. RESULTS: Among the 10 probands with HSNs, eight cases 
      were sporadic, and two had a positive family history. Six probands had 
      early-onset (onset age < 20 years). Seven probands presented with pure-HSNs type, 
      and three exhibited HSNs-complex type with ataxia. Variants in the NTRK1, SPTLC1, 
      COX20, PUM1, and RFC1 genes were detected in six probands. A novel variant, 
      c.444C>A (p.N148K), in NTRK1 was identified in an autosomal recessive inheritance 
      family with HSAN-IV, and a novel variant, c.182dup (p.H61Qfs*31), in PUM1 was 
      identified in a proband with adult-onset paresthesia and mild cerebellar ataxia. 
      Additionally, biallelic expansion of the pathogenic variant structure (AAGGG)exp 
      repeat amplification in the RFC1 gene was identified in a proband with sensory 
      neuropathy, ataxia, and right vestibular hypofunction. CONCLUSIONS: The novel 
      variants in NTRK1 and PUM1 expanded the genotypic spectrum of HSNs. This study 
      highlights the associations between sensory neuropathies and other symptoms, 
      particularly cerebellar ataxia. Given the ultra-rarity of HSNs, future 
      multicenter studies with larger cohorts may facilitate the identification of 
      novel variants, improve genetic diagnostic rates, and enhance disease 
      recognition.

AB  - While whole-genome sequencing (WGS) using short-read technology has become a 
      standard diagnostic test, this technology has limitations in analyzing certain 
      genomic regions, particularly short tandem repeats (STRs). These repetitive 
      sequences are associated with over 50 diseases, primarily affecting neurological 
      function, including Huntington disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Friedreich's 
      ataxia. We analyzed 2689 cases with movement disorders and dementia-related 
      phenotypes processed at Variantyx in 2023-2024 using a two-tiered approach, with 
      an initial short-read WGS followed by ONT long-read sequencing (when necessary) 
      for variant characterization. Of the 2038 cases (75.8%) with clinically relevant 
      genetic variants, 327 (16.0%) required additional long-read analysis. STR 
      variants were reported in 338 cases (16.6% of positive cases), with approximately 
      half requiring long-read sequencing for definitive classification. The combined 
      approach enabled the precise determination of repeat length, composition, somatic 
      mosaicism, and methylation status. Notable advantages included the detection of 
      complex repeat structures in several genes such as RFC1, FGF14, and FXN, where 
      long-read sequencing allowed to determine somatic repeat unit variations and 
      accurate allele phasing. Further studies are needed to establish 
      technology-specific guidelines for the standardized interpretation of long-read 
      sequencing data for the clinical diagnostics of repeat expansion disorders.

AB  - Short tandem repeats (STRs) are common variations in human genomes that 
      frequently expand or contract, causing genetic disorders, mainly when expanded. 
      Traditional diagnostic methods for identifying these expansions, such as 
      repeat-primed PCR and Southern blotting, are often labor-intensive, 
      locus-specific, and are unable to precisely determine long repeat expansions. 
      Sequencing-based methods, although capable of genome-wide detection, are limited 
      by inaccuracy (short-read technologies) and high associated costs (long-read 
      technologies). This study evaluated optical genome mapping (OGM) as an efficient, 
      accurate approach for measuring STR lengths and assessing somatic stability in 85 
      samples with known pathogenic repeat expansions in DMPK, CNBP, and RFC1, causing 
      myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 and cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), respectively. Three workflows-manual de 
      novo assembly, local guided assembly (local-GA), and a molecule distance 
      script-were applied, of which the latter two were developed as part of this study 
      to assess the repeat sizes and somatic repeat stability. OGM successfully 
      identified 84/85 (98.8%) of the pathogenic expansions, distinguishing between 
      wild-type and expanded alleles or between two expanded alleles in recessive 
      cases, with greater accuracy than standard of care (SOC) for long repeats and no 
      apparent upper size limit. Notably, OGM detected somatic instability in a subset 
      of DMPK, CNBP, and RFC1 samples. These findings suggest OGM could advance 
      diagnostic accuracy for large repeat expansions, providing a more comprehensive 
      genome-wide assay for repeat expansion disorders by measuring exact repeat 
      lengths and somatic instability across multiple loci simultaneously.

      Spastic-Ataxia Disorders.

LID - 10.1002/acn3.70008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The hereditary spastic-ataxia spectrum disorders are a group of 
      disabling neurological diseases. The traditional genetic testing pathway is 
      complex, multistep and leaves many cases unsolved. We aim to streamline and 
      improve this process using long-read sequencing. METHODS: We developed a targeted 
      long-read sequencing strategy with the capacity to characterise the genetic 
      variation of all types and sizes within 469 disease-associated genes, in a single 
      assay. We applied this to a cohort of 34 individuals with unsolved 
      spastic-ataxia. An additional five individuals with a known genetic diagnosis 
      were included as positive controls. RESULTS: We identified causative pathogenic 
      variants that would be sufficient for genetic diagnosis in 14/34 (41%) unsolved 
      participants. The success rate was 5/11 (45%) in those who were naive to genetic 
      testing and 9/23 (39%) in those who were undiagnosed after prior genetic testing, 
      completed on a clinical basis. Short tandem repeat expansions in FGF14 were the 
      most common (7/34, 21%). Two individuals (2/34, 6%) had biallelic pathogenic 
      expansions in RFC1 and one individual had a monoallelic pathogenic expansion in 
      ATXN8OS/ATXN8. Causative pathogenic sequence variants other than short tandem 
      repeat expansions were found in four individuals, including in VCP, STUB1, ANO10 
      and SPG7. Furthermore, all five positive controls were identified. 
      INTERPRETATION: Our results demonstrate the utility of targeted long-read 
      sequencing in the genetic evaluation of patients with spastic-ataxia spectrum 
      disorders, highlighting both the capacity to increase overall diagnostic yield 
      and to streamline the testing pathway by capturing all known genetic causes in a 
      single assay.

AB  - Biallelic intronic pentanucleotide repeat expansions, mainly (AAGGG)exp and/or 
      (ACAGG)exp in RFC1, are detected in cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular 
      areflexia syndrome, late-onset ataxia, and in a wide disease spectrum including 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, multiple system atrophy, and Parkinson's disease 
      (PD). However, the genotype-phenotype correlation and underlying mechanism are 
      mostly unknown. We screened RFC1-repeat expansions in 1445 patients with 
      parkinsonism. Comprehensive genetic and clinical, and pathological assessments 
      were performed. We report two early-onset patients with PD carrying complex 
      biallelic pentanucleotide repeat expansions in RFC1. Long-read sequencing 
      revealed a novel repeat configuration of (AGGGG)exp(AAGGG)(14) and a possible 
      somatic variant of (AAGGG)exp(AATGG)exp(AAGGG)exp in the (AAGGG)exp alleles in 
      two RFC1-related PD patients. RNA foci were detected in the (AGGGG)exp-expressed 
      HEK293T cell line as well as (AAGGG)exp and (ACAGG)exp, supporting (AGGGG)exp as 
      a novel pathogenic repeat motif. This work revealed complex genotypes with novel 
      repeat configuration of (AGGGG)exp and possible somatic (AATGG)exp insertion in 
      RFC1-related PD.

TI  - Diagnosis of hereditary ataxias: a real-world single center experience.
PG  - 111
LID - 10.1007/s00415-024-12772-9 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate our experience in the diagnosis of 
      hereditary ataxias (HAs), to analyze data from a real-world scenario. STUDY 
      DESIGN: This is a retrospective, cross-sectional, descriptive study conducted at 
      a single Italian adult neurogenetic outpatient clinic, in 147 patients affected 
      by ataxia with a suspicion of hereditary forms, recruited from November 1999 to 
      February 2024. A stepwise approach for molecular diagnostics was applied: 
      targeted gene panel (TP) next-generation sequencing (NGS) and/or clinical exome 
      sequencing (CES) were performed in the case of inconclusive first-line genetic 
      testing, such as short tandem repeat expansions (TREs) testing for most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1-3, 6-8,12,17, DRPLA), other forms [Fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) and 
      mitochondrial DNA-related ataxia, RFC1-related ataxia/CANVAS] or inconclusive 
      phenotype-guided specific single gene sequencing. RESULT: A definitive diagnosis 
      was reached in 36.7% of the cases. TREs testing was diagnostic in 30.4% of 
      patients. The three most common TREs ataxias were FRDA (36.1%), SCA2 (27.8%), and 
      RFC1-related ataxia/CANVAS (11.1%). In five patients, the molecular diagnosis was 
      achieved by single gene sequencing and causative mutations were identified in 
      POLG (2), SACS (1), DARS2 (1), MT-ATP6 (1). Of 94 patients with a suspicion of 
      HAs of indeterminate genetic origin, 68 underwent new molecular evaluation using 
      the NGS approach. In 28 of these cases, CES was performed after the TP sequencing 
      resulted negative. In 13 patients, the diagnosis was achieved by NGS approach. In 
      7 of these 13 patients, the diagnosis was made by CES. Genes mutations identified 
      as causative of HAs were found in SPG7 (4), SACS (1), CACNA1A (1), CACNA1G (1), 
      EEF2 (1), PRKCG (1), KCNC3 (1), ADCK3 (1), SYNE1 (1), ITPR1 (1). A positive 
      family history of ataxia and early onset of symptoms were associated with a 
      higher likelihood of obtaining a definite diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The molecular 
      diagnosis of HAs remains a significant challenge for neurologists. Our data 
      indicate that, in most cases, a diagnosis of HA can be established through first 
      line genetic testing, particularly TREs testing. However, for patients with a 
      clinical diagnosis of HA who do not achieve a molecular diagnosis through initial 
      genetic tests, the use of NGS proves to be a valuable tool, providing a 
      definitive diagnosis in approximately 20% of cases. Therefore, when feasible in 
      clinical practice, integrating NGS testing, especially exome sequencing, into the 
      diagnostic decision-making process for unsolved cases is crucial.

TI  - Repeat expansions in RFC1 gene in refractory chronic cough.
LID - 00584-2024 [pii]
LID - 10.1183/23120541.00584-2024 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Refractory chronic cough (RCC), persisting despite addressing 
      contributory diagnoses, is likely underpinned by neurally mediated cough 
      hypersensitivity. RFC1 disorders are genetic neurodegenerative conditions caused 
      by biallelic RFC1 repeat expansion sequences, commonly presenting with cough, 
      followed by neurological features including cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). The prevalence and identifying clinical 
      characteristics of RFC1 repeat-expansion disorders in patients with RCC are 
      unknown. METHODS: Consecutive patients with RCC underwent RFC1 genotyping, cough 
      severity visual analogue scale (VAS) and cough-specific health status assessment 
      (Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ)). Participants with biallelic RFC1 repeat 
      expansions (RFC1(++)) also underwent nerve conduction studies, brain imaging 
      (MRI) and cough reflex sensitivity testing. RESULTS: 51 participants with RCC 
      were recruited; 36 (71%) female, median (IQR) age 65 (56-70) years, duration of 
      cough 12.8 (6.9-20.0) years. Four (8%) were RFC1(++), five (10%) monoallelic 
      carriers (RFC1(+-)) and 42 (82%) of wild-type genotype (RFC1(--)). No difference 
      was observed in age, sex, cough duration, spirometry, VAS or LCQ scores between 
      RFC1(++) and RFC1(--) subjects (p>0.05). The symptom of pins and needles was more 
      frequent in RFC1(++) (n=4, 100%) compared to RFC1(--) (n=12, 33%) (p=0.01). 
      RFC1(++) participants had impaired sensory action potentials, and one had 
      cerebellar atrophy. RFC1(++) participants had heightened cough reflex sensitivity 
      to capsaicin, similar to previous CANVAS and RCC studies. CONCLUSION: Biallelic 
      RFC1 repeat expansions (RFC1(++)) were present in 8% of RCC patients. RFC1(++) 
      participants demonstrated features of cough reflex hypersensitivity. RFC1(++) 
      chronic cough had few identifying features, although symptoms of pins and needles 
      were more common.

AB  - INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: Biallelic expansion of the pentanucleotide AAGGG in the 
      RFC1- gene is associated with cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular 
      areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). This study aimed to comprehensively characterise 
      this condition by conducting an in-depth neurophysiological examination of 
      afflicted patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted in 31 
      RFC1-positive patients. Assessment included clinical examination and 
      electrodiagnostic tests: nerve conduction studies, F waves, needle 
      electromyography, H, blink and masseter reflexes; Autonomic Nervous System (ANS): 
      Heart Rate Variability, Sympathetic Skin Response and Electrochemical Skin 
      Conductance, and Quantitative Sensory Test (QST). Medullar tracts were assessed 
      using Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SEPs) and Transcranial Magnetic 
      Stimulation. RESULTS: All patients exhibited moderate to severe sensory axonal 
      neuropathy/neuronopathy, whereas motor nerve conduction parameters and the 
      pyramidal pathway showed no abnormalities. Tibial nerve SEPs were absent or 
      severely attenuated in all patients, and were moderately affected by the median 
      nerve. H-reflexes were preserved in 85.7% and blink reflex in 60% of tested 
      patients. ANS tests yielded predominantly normal results, although 74% 
      demonstrated impaired QST. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the characteristic 
      features of sensory neuropathy/neuronopathy and severe somatosensory deficits, 
      with predominantly preserved H-reflexes and motor sparing. Thermoalgesic fibres 
      are frequently involved, whereas the ANS is relatively preserved. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Neurophysiological examinations can objectively characterize the spectrum of 
      RFC1-related disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Late-onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA) is a slowly progressive cerebellar 
      disorder with symptom onset >/=30years of age. Intronic tandem repeat expansions 
      (TREs) in RFC1 and FGF14 have recently emerged as common causes of LOCA. The 
      relative contribution of classic vs. newly discovered TREs has not been 
      systematically investigated in LOCA cohorts. METHODS: Over 28 years, 206 
      consecutive Greek LOCA index patients were referred for genetic testing and, 
      based on clinical data and inheritance pattern, screened for FRDA, SCA1,2,3,6,7, 
      FXTAS, CANVAS and SCA27B. RESULTS: A genetic diagnosis was reached in 62 of 206 
      cases (30.1 %). Mean age was 60.1 +/- 11.2 (35-87) years and mean age at onset 
      (AAO) 52.5 +/- 11.4 (30-80) years. SCA27B accounted for 9.7 % of LOCA cases, CANVAS 
      for 7.8 % and FRDA for 4.4 %. The overall frequency of SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 was 
      6.8 %. No cases of SCA3 and SCA6 were identified. FXTAS contributed 1.5 % of 
      cases. In sporadic cases, the diagnostic yield was 22.8 % (34 of 149; SCA27B: 
      8.7 %, CANVAS: 8.1 %, FRDA: 2.7 %, SCA2: 1.3 %, FXTAS: 1.3 % and SCA7: 0.7 %). In 
      familial cases, the diagnostic yield was 49.1 % (28 of 57). Two cases with CANVAS 
      had pseudodominant inheritance. Patients with SCA27B, CANVAS and FXTAS had mean 
      AAO > 50 years, whereas patients with FRDA, SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 had mean 
      AAO < 50 years. CONCLUSION: Recently-discovered TREs causing SCA27B and CANVAS 
      represent the commonest known genetic causes of LOCA. Prioritizing testing for 
      FGF14 and RFC1 expansions in the diagnostic algorithm of LOCA is recommended.

AB  - Numerous neurological disorders are linked to sequences rich in guanine repeats 
      found in introns, exons, and regulatory regions of genes. These sequences have 
      been observed to form stable G-quadruplex (GQ) structures both in vitro and in 
      vitro. Cerebellar Ataxia with Neuropathy and Vestibular Areflexia Syndrome 
      (CANVAS), a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is associated with the 
      biallelic expansion of (AAGGG)(n) pathogenic repeats in the second intron of the 
      RFC1 gene. Though these G-rich pathogenic repeats in other neurological diseases 
      are associated with protein loss of function, RNA gain of function, and/or 
      protein gain of function, not much is known about the pathological mechanism 
      associated with CANVAS. Herein, we report the formation of stable GQ 
      conformations in the CANVAS-associated repeats i.e., r(AAGGG)(n), where 'r' 
      stands for RNA. These GQs are critical regulators in neurological disorders 
      leading to RNA foci formation and RNA binding protein sequestration. They also 
      alter other causative processes like intron retention, which leads us to 
      hypothesize a toxic Proteinopathy mechanism in CANVAS. Various biophysical and 
      biomolecular assays characterized the interactions of three aggregation-prone 
      RNA-binding proteins (RBPs): heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1/F (hnRNP 
      H1/F), and DGCR8 with different pathogenic repeats [(AAGGG)(9)] in vitro, further 
      affirming the hypothesis. The biophysical observations are further supported by 
      molecular dynamics analysis and cell-based studies, putting us a step closer to 
      elucidating the pathological mechanism(s) in CANVAS neuropathy, paving the way 
      for the development of innovative therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Early Peripheral Nerve Involvement at the Time of Coughing in Patients With RFC1 
      Intronic Expansion.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome 
      results from variations in RFC1 and is mostly caused by intronic biallelic 
      pathogenic expansions (RE-RFC1). Refractory chronic cough (RCC) is frequently 
      observed for years to decades preceding ataxia onset. Whether peripheral nerves 
      are involved in the presymptomatic phase characterized by RCC is uncertain. 
      METHODS: Here, patients previously screened for RCC and identified as having at 
      least one RE-RFC1 intronic expansion underwent a comprehensive clinical and 
      neurophysiologic assessment and were screened for additional exonic variations. 
      RESULTS: Fourteen patients with RCC and RE-RFC1 were investigated. Seven patients 
      presented with biallelic RE-RFC1 (Bi-RE-RFC1) while 7 presented with monoallelic 
      RE-RFC1 (Mono-RE-RFC1). In patients with Mono-RE-RFC1, no additional exonic 
      variation was identified, and clinical examinations were normal. Most of the 
      patients with Bi-RE-RFC1 presented with subtle neurologic impairment, mainly 
      exhibiting decreased lower limb vibration sense (85.7%). Nerve conduction studies 
      revealed that all patients with Bi-RE-RFC1 exhibited lower sensory sum scores 
      than patients with Mono-RE-RFC1 (median 20.2 microV vs 84.9 microV, p = 0.0012). In 
      addition, the radial-to-sural sensory ratios were null or inverted (>0.5) in all 
      patients but one with Bi-RE-RFC1, which is consistent with sensory neuronopathy. 
      DISCUSSION: Patients with Bi-RE-RFC1 already exhibit widespread sensory neuron 
      involvement at the time of apparently isolated RCC.

TI  - Case report: Neuroacanthocytosis associated with novel variants in the VPS13A 
      gene with concomitant nucleotide expansion for CANVAS and assessment with osmotic 
      gradient ektacytometry.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The diseases historically known as neuroacanthocytosis 
      (NA) conditions include VPS13A disease (formerly chorea-acanthocytosis) and XK 
      disease (formerly McLeod syndrome). Here we report a patient with a hyperkinetic 
      syndrome associated with variants in VPS13A with a concomitant homozygous 
      nucleotide expansion in Replication factor C, subunit 1 (RFC1) and evaluate the 
      role of ektacytometry for the assessment of acanthocytes. METHODS: Investigations 
      included clinical assessments, neuroimaging studies, laboratory analyses, blood 
      smears, ektacytometry, psychometric evaluation, and genetic analyses. Using 
      ektacytometry, an osmoscan curve is obtained yielding a diffraction pattern as a 
      measure of average erythrocyte deformability from circular at rest to elliptical 
      at a high shear stress. The pattern allows the derivation of several parameters 
      (mainly EI-max, O-min and O-Hyper points). Samples from two other patients with 
      genetically proven VPS13A disorder and XK disease and varying numbers of 
      acanthocytes as well as from a fourth with acanthocytosis due to liver failure 
      were also analyzed. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient has impulsivity, chorea and 
      disabling feeding dystonia refractory to treatment and 15% acanthocytes in 
      peripheral blood. Genetic workup revealed compound heterozygous variants 
      c.1732_1733del; p.(V578Ffs*9) and c.8282C > A, p.(S2761*) in VPS13A with absence 
      of chorein in the blood, the latter variant is novel. In addition, he harbors a 
      homozygous nucleotide expansion in the RFC1 gene, reported in cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). However, the patient does not 
      display ataxia yet. Ektacytometry revealed significantly reduced erythrocyte 
      deformability in this patient and in another man with VPS13A disease. In 
      contrast, the patient with XK disease had 2% acanthocytes and mild abnormalities 
      on ektacytometry. In the three cases, ektacytometry yielded a specific pattern, 
      different from acanthocytosis due to liver failure. CONCLUSION: Pathogenicity of 
      the VPS13A variants is confirmed by absence of chorein, long-term follow up is 
      required to evaluate any synergistic impact of for the underlying CANVAS 
      mutation. New generation ektacytometry provides an objective measurement of 
      erythrocytes' rheological properties and may serve as a complement to blood 
      smears. Finally, ektacytometry's ability to detect deformability of erythrocytes 
      in NA seems to depend on the degree of acanthocytosis.

AB  - Tandem repeats (TRs) play important roles in genomic variation and disease risk 
      in humans. Long-read sequencing allows for the accurate characterization of TRs; 
      however, the underlying bioinformatics perspectives remain challenging. We 
      present otter and TREAT: otter is a fast targeted local assembler, 
      cross-compatible across different sequencing platforms. It is integrated in 
      TREAT, an end-to-end workflow for TR characterization, visualization, and 
      analysis across multiple genomes. In a comparison with existing tools based on 
      long-read sequencing data from both Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT, Simplex and 
      Duplex) and Pacific Bioscience (PacBio, Sequel II and Revio), otter and TREAT 
      achieve state-of-the-art genotyping and motif characterization accuracy. Applied 
      to clinically relevant TRs, TREAT/otter significantly identify individuals with 
      pathogenic TR expansions. When applied to a case-control setting, we replicate 
      previously reported associations of TRs with Alzheimer's disease, including those 
      near or within APOC1 (P = 2.63 x 10(-9)), SPI1 (P = 6.5 x 10(-3)), and ABCA7 (P = 
      0.04) genes. Finally, we use TREAT/otter to systematically evaluate potential 
      biases when genotyping TRs using diverse ONT and PacBio long-read sequencing data 
      sets. We show that, in rare cases (0.06%), long-read sequencing from coverage 
      drops in TRs, including the disease-associated TRs in ABCA7 and RFC1 genes. Such 
      coverage drops can lead to TR misgenotyping, hampering the accurate 
      characterization of TR alleles. Taken together, our tools can accurately genotype 
      TRs across different sequencing technologies and with minimal requirements, 
      allowing end-to-end analysis and comparisons of TRs in human genomes, with broad 
      applications in research and clinical fields.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome 
      (CANVAS), a relatively common cause of late-onset progressive ataxia, is a 
      genetic disease characterised by biallelic pentanucleotide AAGGG repeat expansion 
      in intron 2 of the replication factor complex subunit 1 gene. Herein, we describe 
      the first molecularly confirmed CANVAS family with five affected siblings from 
      Turkey. CASE PRESENTATION: The family comprised seven siblings born from healthy 
      non-consanguineous parents. CANVAS phenotype was present in five of them; two 
      were healthy and asymptomatic. Chronic cough was the first symptom reported in 
      all five siblings, followed by the development of sensory symptoms, oscillopsia 
      and imbalance. Clinical head impulse test (HIT) was positive in all cases and 
      video HIT performed on three patients revealed very low vestibulo-ocular reflex 
      gains bilaterally. Magnetic resonance imaging and nerve conduction studies 
      revealed cerebellar atrophy and sensory neuronopathy, respectively. RP-PCR 
      confirmed the homozygous presence of the AAGGG repeat expansion in all five 
      cases. CONCLUSION: Genetic screening for CANVAS should be considered in all 
      patients with late-onset ataxia, sensory disturbances and vestibular involvement, 
      especially in the presence of chronic cough.

      pathologic biallelic RFC1 repeat expansions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome 
      (CANVAS) is caused by RFC1 expansions. Sensory neuronopathy, polyneuropathy, and 
      involvement of motor, autonomic, and cranial nerves have all been described with 
      RFC1 expansions. We aimed to describe the electrodiagnostic features of patients 
      with RFC1 expansions through multimodal electrophysiological investigations. 
      METHODS: Thirty-five patients, with a median age of 70 years, and pathologic 
      biallelic repeat expansions in the RFC1 gene, were tested for motor and sensory 
      nerve conduction, flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and soleus H-reflexes, blink 
      reflex, electrochemical skin conductance, sympathetic skin response (SSR), and 
      heart rate variability with deep breathing (HRV). RESULTS: Only 16 patients (46%) 
      exhibited the full clinical CANVAS spectrum. Distal motor amplitudes were normal 
      in 30 patients and reduced in the legs of five patients. Distal sensory 
      amplitudes were bilaterally reduced in a non-length dependent manner in 30 
      patients. Conduction velocities were normal. Soleus H-reflexes were abnormal in 
      19/20 patients of whom seven had preserved Achilles reflexes. FCR H-reflexes were 
      absent or decreased in amplitude in 13/14 patients. Blink reflex was abnormal in 
      4/19 patients: R1 latencies for two patients and R2 latencies for two others. 
      Fourteen out of 31 patients (45%) had abnormal results in at least one autonomic 
      nervous system test, either for ESC (12/31), SSR (5/14), or HRV (6/19). 
      DISCUSSION: Less than half of the patients with RFC1 expansions exhibited the 
      full clinical CANVAS spectrum, but nearly all exhibited typical sensory 
      neuronopathy and abnormal H-reflexes. Involvement of small nerve fibers and 
      brainstem neurons was less common.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a 
      recessively inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by intronic biallelic, 
      nonreference CCCTT/AAGGG repeat expansions within RFC1. To investigate how these 
      repeats cause disease, we generated patient induced pluripotent stem cell-derived 
      neurons (iNeurons). CCCTT/AAGGG repeat expansions do not alter neuronal RFC1 
      splicing, expression, or DNA repair pathway function. In reporter assays, AAGGG 
      repeats are translated into pentapeptide repeat proteins. However, these proteins 
      and repeat RNA foci were not detected in iNeurons, and overexpression of these 
      repeats failed to induce neuronal toxicity. CANVAS iNeurons exhibit defects in 
      neuronal development and diminished synaptic connectivity that is rescued by 
      CRISPR deletion of a single expanded AAGGG allele. These deficits were neither 
      replicated by RFC1 knockdown in control iNeurons nor rescued by RFC1 reprovision 
      in CANVAS iNeurons. These findings support a repeat-dependent but RFC1 
      protein-independent cause of neuronal dysfunction in CANVAS, with implications 
      for therapeutic development in this currently untreatable condition.

LID - 10.1007/s12311-024-01735-5 [doi]
AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) and disease 
      spectrum is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with biallelic repeat 
      expansion (RE) in the RFC1 gene. A high carrier frequency in the healthy 
      population determines the possibility of having affected members in two 
      consecutive generations. We describe pseudodominance in two families affected 
      with RFC1 disorder (10 affected, 5 oligo/asymptomatic individuals). In Family A, 
      after the 75-year-old index case was diagnosed with CANVAS, the 73-year-old wife 
      decided to undergo screening for carrier testing. Although she did not report any 
      symptoms, she resulted positive for the biallelic AAGGG RE thus leading to a 
      diagnosis in the asymptomatic offspring as well and revealing a pseudodominant 
      pattern of inheritance. In Family B pseudodominance was suspected after the 
      identification of the RFC1 RE in the proband affected by sensitive neuropathy 
      because of a positive family history for undetermined polyneuropathy in the 
      mother. The post-mortem identification of the RFC1 RE in a sample specimen from 
      the deceased mother, who had been under our care, allowed the solution of a "cold 
      case". Our report suggests that pseudodominance is a confounding phenomenon to 
      consider in RFC1-spectrum disorder and genetic counselling is instrumental in 
      families with affected individuals.

TI  - Nerve ultrasound in CANVAS-spectrum disease: Reduced nerve size distinguishes 
      genetically confirmed CANVAS from other axonal polyneuropathies.
PG  - 464-471
LID - 10.1111/jns.12655 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ultrasound nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) of patients 
      affected with axonal neuropathy usually shows normal value. Cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) seems to represent an 
      exception, showing smaller CSA, but previous reports did not test for biallelic 
      RFC1 gene repeat expansions. METHODS: We compared nerve CSA from CANVAS patients 
      (tested positive for biallelic RFC1 gene repeat expansions) with the CSA from a 
      group of patients with chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (CIAP) who tested 
      negative for RFC1 gene repeat expansions, hereditary axonal neuropathy 
      (Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2, CMT2), and Friedreich ataxia (FRDA). RESULTS: We 
      enrolled 15 CANVAS patients (eight men, mean age 66.3 +/- 11.5 years, mean disease 
      duration 9.3 +/- 4.1 years), affected with sensory axonal neuronopathy. Controls 
      consisted of 13 CIAP (mean age 68.5 +/- 12.8 years, seven men), seven CMT2 (mean 
      age 47.9 +/- 18.1 years, four men), 12 FRDA (mean age 33.7 +/- 8.8, five men). Nerve 
      ultrasound was performed at median, ulnar, sciatic, sural, and tibial nerves and 
      brachial plexus, bilaterally. The nerve CSA from CANVAS patients was 
      significantly smaller than the one from the other cohorts at several sites with 
      significant and high accuracy at Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
      analyses. RFC1 AAGGG pentanucleotide expansion, disease duration, and disability 
      did not correlate with CSA at any site, after Bonferroni correction. 
      INTERPRETATION: Decreased sonographic nerve sizes, in arms and legs, in patients 
      with sensory neuropathy and normal motor conduction studies could point to 
      CANVAS-spectrum disease and help guide appropriate genetic testing.

TI  - Genetic profiles of multiple system atrophy revealed by exome sequencing, 
      long-read sequencing and spinocerebellar ataxia repeat expansion analysis.
PG  - e16441

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive, 
      adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by combinations 
      of autonomic failure, parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia and pyramidal signs. 
      Although a few genetic factors have been reported to contribute to the disease, 
      its mutational profiles have not been systemically studied. METHODS: To address 
      the genetic profiles of clinically diagnosed MSA patients, exome sequencing and 
      triplet repeat detection was conducted in 205 MSA patients, including one 
      familial case. The pathogenicity of variants was determined according to the 
      American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for 
      Molecular Pathology guidelines. RESULTS: In the familial patient, a novel 
      heterozygous COQ2 pathogenic variant (p.Ala351Thr) was identified in the MSA 
      pedigree. In the sporadic patients, 29 pathogenic variants were revealed in 21 
      genes, and the PARK7 p.Ala104Thr variant was significantly associated with MSA 
      (p = 0.0018). Moreover, burden tests demonstrated that the pathogenic variants 
      were enriched in cerebellar ataxia-related genes in patients. Furthermore, repeat 
      expansion analyses revealed that two patients carried the pathogenic CAG repeat 
      expansion in the CACNA1A gene (SCA6), one patient carried the 
      (ACAGG)exp/(ACAGG)exp expansion in RFC1 and one carried the GAA-pure expansion in 
      FGF14 gene. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, a novel COQ2 pathogenic variant was 
      identified in a familial MSA patient, and repeat expansions in CACNA1A, RFC1 and 
      FGF14 gene were detected in four sporadic patients. Moreover, a PARK7 variant and 
      the burden of pathogenic variants in cerebellar ataxia-related genes were 
      associated with MSA.

AB  - Chronic cough is a frequent disorder that is defined by cough of more than 
      8 weeks duration. Despite extensive investigation, some patients exhibit no 
      aetiology and others do not respond to specific treatments directed against 
      apparent causes of cough. Such patients are identified as having unexplained or 
      refractory chronic cough. Recently, a high proportion of patients with chronic 
      cough in the context of cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia 
      syndrome (CANVAS) was highlighted. CANVAS is a rare neurological disorder with a 
      biallelic variation in the replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) gene 
      corresponding mostly to an intronic AAGGG repeat expansion. Chronic cough in 
      patients with CANVAS shares similar characteristics with cough hypersensitivity 
      syndrome. The high prevalence of chronic cough in CANVAS gives the opportunity to 
      better understand the neurogenic mechanism of chronic cough. In this review, we 
      will describe the characteristics and mechanisms of CANVAS. We will also address 
      the potential mechanisms responsible for chronic cough in CANVAS. Finally, we 
      will address chronic cough management in the context of CANVAS.

AB  - Biallelic expansions of the AAGGG repeat in the replication factor C subunit 1 
      (RFC1) have recently been described to be responsible for cerebellar ataxia, 
      peripheral neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome. This genetic alteration 
      has also allowed genetic classification in up to one-third of cases with 
      idiopathic sensory neuropathy. Here, we screened a well-characterized cohort of 
      inflammatory neuropathy patients for RFC1 repeat expansions to explore whether 
      RFC1 was increased from background rates and possibly involved in the 
      pathogenesis of inflammatory neuropathy. A total of 259 individuals with 
      inflammatory neuropathy and 243 healthy controls were screened for the AAGGG 
      repeat expansion using short-range flanking PCR and repeat-primed PCR. Cases 
      without amplifiable PCR product on flanking PCR and positive repeat-primed PCR 
      were also tested for the mostly non-pathogenic expansions of the AAAGG and AAAAG 
      repeat units. None of the patients showed biallelic AAGGG expansion of RFC1, and 
      their carrier frequency for AAGGG was comparable with controls [n = 27 (5.2%) and 
      n = 23 (4.7%), respectively; P > 0.5]. Data suggest that the pathologic 
      expansions of AAGGG repeats do not contribute to the development of inflammatory 
      neuropathies nor lead to misdiagnosed cases. Accordingly, routine genetic 
      screening for RFC1 repeat expansion is not indicated in this patient population.

TI  - Analysis and occurrence of biallelic pathogenic repeat expansions in RFC1 in a 
      German cohort of patients with a main clinical phenotype of motor neuron disease.
PG  - 5804-5812
LID - 10.1007/s00415-024-12519-6 [doi]
AB  - Biallelic pathogenic repeat expansions in RFC1 were recently identified as 
      molecular origin of cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome 
      (CANVAS) as well as of one of the most common causes of adult-onset ataxia. In 
      the meantime, the phenotypic spectrum has expanded massively and now includes 
      mimics of multiple system atrophy or parkinsonism. After identifying a patient 
      with a clinical diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as a carrier of 
      biallelic pathogenic repeat expansions in RFC1, we studied a cohort of 106 
      additional patients with a clinical main phenotype of motor neuron disease (MND) 
      to analyze whether such repeat expansions are more common in MND patients. 
      Indeed, two additional MND patients (one also with ALS and one with primary 
      lateral sclerosis/PLS) have been identified as carrier of biallelic pathogenic 
      repeat expansions in RFC1 in the absence of another genetic alteration explaining 
      the phenotype, suggesting motor neuron disease as another extreme phenotype of 
      RFC1 spectrum disorder. Therefore, MND might belong to the expanding phenotypic 
      spectrum of pathogenic RFC1 repeat expansions, particularly in those MND patients 
      with additional features such as sensory and/or autonomic neuropathy, vestibular 
      deficits, or cerebellar signs. By systematically analyzing the RFC1 repeat array 
      using Oxford nanopore technology long-read sequencing, our study highlights the 
      high intra- and interallelic heterogeneity of this locus and allows the 
      identification of the novel repeat motif 'ACAAG'.

AB  - A biallelic (AAGGG) expansion in the poly(A) tail of an AluSx3 transposable 
      element within the gene RFC1 is a frequent cause of cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), and more recently, has been 
      reported as a rare cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) in the Finnish population. 
      Here, we investigate the prevalence of RFC1 (AAGGG) expansions in PD patients of 
      non-Finnish European ancestry in 1609 individuals from the Parkinson's 
      Progression Markers Initiative study. We identified four PD patients carrying the 
      biallelic RFC1 (AAGGG) expansion and did not identify any carriers in controls.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a 
      slowly progressing autosomal recessive ataxic disorder linked to an abnormal 
      biallelic intronic (most commonly) AAGGG repeat expansion in the replication 
      factor complex subunit 1 (RFC1). While the clinical diagnosis is relatively 
      straightforward when the three components of the disorder are present, it becomes 
      challenging when only one of the triad (cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy or 
      vestibular areflexia) manifests. Isolated cases of Bilateral Vestibulopathy (BVP) 
      or vestibular areflexia that later developed the other components of CANVAS have 
      not been documented. We report four cases of patients with chronic imbalance and 
      BVP that, after several years, developed cerebellar and neuropathic deficits with 
      positive genetic testing for RFC1. Our report supports the concept that CANVAS 
      should be considered in every patient with BVP of unknown etiology, even without 
      the presence of the other triad components. This is especially important given 
      that about 50% of cases in many BVP series are diagnosed as idiopathic, some of 
      which may be undiagnosed CANVAS.

TI  - RFC1 and FGF14 Repeat Expansions in Serbian Patients with Cerebellar Ataxia.
PG  - 626-633
LID - 10.1002/mdc3.14020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The newly discovered intronic repeat expansions in the genes encoding 
      replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) and fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) 
      frequently cause late-onset cerebellar ataxia. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the 
      presence of RFC1 and FGF14 pathogenic repeat expansions in Serbian patients with 
      adult-onset cerebellar ataxia. METHODS: The study included 167 unrelated patients 
      with sporadic or familial cerebellar ataxia. The RFC1 repeat expansion analysis 
      was performed by duplex PCR and Sanger sequencing, while the FGF14 repeat 
      expansion was tested for by long-range PCR, repeat-primed PCR, and Sanger 
      sequencing. RESULTS: We identified pathogenic repeat expansions in RFC1 in seven 
      patients (7/167; 4.2%) with late-onset sporadic ataxia with neuropathy and 
      chronic cough. Two patients also had bilateral vestibulopathy. Repeat expansions 
      in FGF14 were found in nine unrelated patients (9/167; 5.4%) with ataxia, less 
      than half of whom presented with neuropathy and two-thirds with global brain 
      atrophy. Tremor and episodic features were the most frequent additional 
      characteristics in carriers of uninterrupted FGF14 repeat expansions. Among the 
      122 sporadic cases, 12 (9.8%) carried an expansion in either RFC1 or FGF14, 
      comparable to 4/45 (8.9%) among the patients with a positive family history. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Pathogenic repeat expansions in RFC1 and FGF14 are relatively 
      frequent causes of adult-onset cerebellar ataxia, especially among sporadic 
      patients, indicating that family history should not be considered when 
      prioritizing ataxia patients for testing of RFC1 or FGF14 repeat expansions.

AB  - Short tandem repeats are inherently unstable during DNA replication depending on 
      repeat length, and the expansion of the repeat length in the human genome is 
      responsible for repeat expansion disorders. Pentanucleotide AAGGG and ACAGG 
      repeat expansions in intron 2 of the gene encoding replication factor C subunit 1 
      (RFC1) cause cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome 
      (CANVAS) and other phenotypes of late-onset cerebellar ataxia. Herein, we reveal 
      the structural polymorphism of the RFC1 repeats associated with CANVAS in vitro. 
      Single-stranded AAGGG repeat DNA formed a hybrid-type G-quadruplex, whereas its 
      RNA formed a parallel-type G-quadruplex with three layers. The RNA of the ACAGG 
      repeat formed hairpin structure comprising C-G and G-C base pairs with A:A and 
      GA:AG mismatched repeats. Furthermore, both pathogenic repeat RNAs formed more 
      rigid structures than those of the nonpathogenic repeat RNAs. These findings 
      provide novel insights into the structural polymorphism of the RFC1 repeats, 
      which may be closely related to the disease mechanism of CANVAS.

TI  - Pathogenic CANVAS (AAGGG)n repeats stall DNA replication due to the formation of 
      alternative DNA structures.
PG  - 4361-4374
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkae124 [doi]
AB  - CANVAS is a recently characterized repeat expansion disease, most commonly caused 
      by homozygous expansions of an intronic (A2G3)n repeat in the RFC1 gene. There 
      are a multitude of repeat motifs found in the human population at this locus, 
      some of which are pathogenic and others benign. In this study, we conducted 
      structure-functional analyses of the pathogenic (A2G3)n and nonpathogenic (A4G)n 
      repeats. We found that the pathogenic, but not the nonpathogenic, repeat presents 
      a potent, orientation-dependent impediment to DNA polymerization in vitro. The 
      pattern of the polymerization blockage is consistent with triplex or quadruplex 
      formation in the presence of magnesium or potassium ions, respectively. Chemical 
      probing of both repeats in vitro reveals triplex H-DNA formation by only the 
      pathogenic repeat. Consistently, bioinformatic analysis of S1-END-seq data from 
      human cell lines shows preferential H-DNA formation genome-wide by (A2G3)n motifs 
      over (A4G)n motifs. Finally, the pathogenic, but not the nonpathogenic, repeat 
      stalls replication fork progression in yeast and human cells. We hypothesize that 
      the CANVAS-causing (A2G3)n repeat represents a challenge to genome stability by 
      folding into alternative DNA structures that stall DNA replication.

TI  - RFC1 repeat expansions in downbeat nystagmus syndromes: frequency and phenotypic 
      profile.
PG  - 2886-2892
LID - 10.1007/s00415-024-12229-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The cause of downbeat nystagmus (DBN) remains unknown in a 
      substantial number of patients ("idiopathic"), although intronic GAA expansions 
      in FGF14 have recently been shown to account for almost 50% of yet idiopathic 
      cases. Here, we hypothesized that biallelic RFC1 expansions may also represent a 
      recurrent cause of DBN syndrome. METHODS: We genotyped the RFC1 repeat and 
      performed in-depth phenotyping in 203 patients with DBN, including 65 patients 
      with idiopathic DBN, 102 patients carrying an FGF14 GAA expansion, and 36 
      patients with presumed secondary DBN. RESULTS: Biallelic RFC1 AAGGG expansions 
      were identified in 15/65 patients with idiopathic DBN (23%). None of the 102 
      GAA-FGF14-positive patients, but 2/36 (6%) of patients with presumed secondary 
      DBN carried biallelic RFC1 expansions. The DBN syndrome in RFC1-positive patients 
      was characterized by additional cerebellar impairment in 100% (15/15), bilateral 
      vestibulopathy (BVP) in 100% (15/15), and polyneuropathy in 80% (12/15) of cases. 
      Compared to GAA-FGF14-positive and genetically unexplained patients, 
      RFC1-positive patients had significantly more frequent neuropathic features on 
      examination and BVP. Furthermore, vestibular function, as measured by the video 
      head impulse test, was significantly more impaired in RFC1-positive patients. 
      DISCUSSION: Biallelic RFC1 expansions are a common monogenic cause of DBN 
      syndrome.

TI  - Comprehensive Analysis of a Japanese Pedigree with Biallelic ACAGG Expansions in 
      RFC1 Manifesting Motor Neuronopathy with Painful Muscle Cramps.
PG  - 1498-1508
LID - 10.1007/s12311-024-01666-1 [doi]
AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is an 
      autosomal recessive multisystem neurologic disorder caused by biallelic intronic 
      repeats in RFC1. Although the phenotype of CANVAS has been expanding via 
      diagnostic case accumulation, there are scant pedigree analyses to reveal disease 
      penetrance, intergenerational fluctuations in repeat length, or clinical 
      phenomena (including heterozygous carriers). We identified biallelic RFC1 ACAGG 
      expansions of 1000 ~ repeats in three affected siblings having sensorimotor 
      neuronopathy with spinocerebellar atrophy initially presenting with painful 
      muscle cramps and paroxysmal dry cough. They exhibit almost homogeneous clinical 
      and histopathological features, indicating motor neuronopathy. Over 10 years of 
      follow-up, painful intractable muscle cramps ascended from legs to trunks and 
      hands, followed by amyotrophy and subsequent leg pyramidal signs. The disease 
      course combined with the electrophysical and imagery data suggest initial and 
      prolonged hyperexcitability and the ensuing spinal motor neuron loss, which may 
      progress from the lumbar to the rostral anterior horns and later expand to the 
      corticospinal tract. Genetically, heterozygous ACAGG expansions of similar length 
      were transmitted in unaffected family members of three successive generations, 
      and some of them experienced muscle cramps. Leukocyte telomere length assays 
      revealed comparatively shorter telomeres in affected individuals. This 
      comprehensive pedigree analysis demonstrated a non-anticipating ACAGG 
      transmission and high penetrance of manifestations with a biallelic state, 
      especially motor neuronopathy in which muscle cramps serve as a prodromal and 
      disease progress marker. CANVAS and RFC1 spectrum disorder should be considered 
      when diagnosing lower dominant motor neuron disease, idiopathic muscle cramps, or 
      neuromuscular hyperexcitability syndromes.

TI  - The impact of folate pathway variants on the outcome of methotrexate therapy in 
      rheumatoid arthritis patients.
PG  - 971-983
LID - 10.1007/s10067-024-06892-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are currently no validated criteria that entirely explain or 
      predict response to methotrexate (MTX) treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We 
      tried to identify the connection between three variants (RFC1 G80A (rs1051266), 
      TYMS 2R/3R (rs34743033), and ATIC C347G (rs2372536)) in the folate pathway of MTX 
      metabolism and the response to MTX monotherapy in a cohort of RA cases. METHODS: 
      A prospective study on 100 RA patients on MTX monotherapy was performed. Disease 
      activity was measured at the start of treatment and 6 months after treatment with 
      MTX. The patients were then split into two groups: those who responded to the 
      treatment and those who did not. The molecular genetic study for the RFC1 (G80A) 
      variant was employed via the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism 
      (PCR-RFLP) technique, the ATIC (C347G) variant was performed using TaqMan allelic 
      discrimination real-time PCR, and the tandem repeat sequences of TYMS (2R/3R) 
      were amplified by conventional PCR and detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. 
      RESULTS: The genotype distribution of RFC-1 (G80A) showed significant variations 
      among non-responders and responders in the recessive genetic model. A significant 
      difference was found in TYMS (2R/3R) in the dominant and heterozygous genetic 
      models. However, ATIC (C347G) genotype frequency did not exhibit substantial link 
      with drug response in all genetic models. Furthermore, the genotype and allele 
      rates of the analyzed variants did not show any significant association with 
      adverse events in all genetic models. CONCLUSION: The 80AA genotype of RFC-1 G80A 
      and the 2R/3R or 3R/3R genotypes of TYMS 2R/3R are more vulnerable to the good 
      consequences of MTX therapy. Key Points * Current recommendations support the 
      gold standard role of MTX as a first-line monotherapy for RA patients. However, 
      up to 40% of RA patients do not respond or exhibit partial response to MTX. * 
      Persistent disease activity due to treatment unresponsiveness will affect the 
      long-term outcomes in RA patients. * We aimed, through molecular genetic study, 
      to identify the connection between three variants in the folate pathway of MTX 
      metabolism and the response to methotrexate monotherapy in a cohort of RA 
      patients.

AB  - A 56-year-old man was born to consanguineous parents. He experienced 
      slow-progressing sensory disturbances in the upper extremities. T1-weighted 
      images showed cerebellar atrophy. 123I-IMP SPECT revealed reduced cerebral blood 
      flow in the cerebellum. 123I-FP-CIT SPECT showed low uptake of dopamine 
      transporter in the bilateral tail of the striatum. 123I-MIBG scintigraphy shows a 
      decreased heart-to-mediastinum ratio. Flanking polymerase chain reaction 
      suggested biallelic repeat expansion in intron 2 of RFC1, and subsequent 
      repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction revealed ACAGG repeat expansion. Thus, he 
      was diagnosed as cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia 
      syndrome.

TI  - Structural investigation of pathogenic RFC1 AAGGG pentanucleotide repeats reveals 
      a role of G-quadruplex in dysregulated gene expression in CANVAS.
PG  - 2698-2710
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkae032 [doi]
AB  - An expansion of AAGGG pentanucleotide repeats in the replication factor C subunit 
      1 (RFC1) gene is the genetic cause of cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), and it also links to several other 
      neurodegenerative diseases including the Parkinson's disease. However, the 
      pathogenic mechanism of RFC1 AAGGG repeat expansion remains enigmatic. Here, we 
      report that the pathogenic RFC1 AAGGG repeats form DNA and RNA parallel 
      G-quadruplex (G4) structures that play a role in impairing biological processes. 
      We determine the first high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure 
      of a bimolecular parallel G4 formed by d(AAGGG)2AA and reveal how AAGGG repeats 
      fold into a higher-order structure composed of three G-tetrad layers, and further 
      demonstrate the formation of intramolecular G4s in longer DNA and RNA repeats. 
      The pathogenic AAGGG repeats, but not the nonpathogenic AAAAG repeats, form G4 
      structures to stall DNA replication and reduce gene expression via impairing the 
      translation process in a repeat-length-dependent manner. Our results provide an 
      unprecedented structural basis for understanding the pathogenic mechanism of 
      AAGGG repeat expansion associated with CANVAS. In addition, the high-resolution 
      structures resolved in this study will facilitate rational design of 
      small-molecule ligands and helicases targeting G4s formed by AAGGG repeats for 
      therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Role of the repeat expansion size in predicting age of onset and severity in RFC1 
      disease.
PG  - 1887-1898
LID - 10.1093/brain/awad436 [doi]
AB  - RFC1 disease, caused by biallelic repeat expansion in RFC1, is clinically 
      heterogeneous in terms of age of onset, disease progression and phenotype. We 
      investigated the role of the repeat size in influencing clinical variables in 
      RFC1 disease. We also assessed the presence and role of meiotic and somatic 
      instability of the repeat. In this study, we identified 553 patients carrying 
      biallelic RFC1 expansions and measured the repeat expansion size in 392 cases. 
      Pearson's coefficient was calculated to assess the correlation between the repeat 
      size and age at disease onset. A Cox model with robust cluster standard errors 
      was adopted to describe the effect of repeat size on age at disease onset, on age 
      at onset of each individual symptoms, and on disease progression. A quasi-Poisson 
      regression model was used to analyse the relationship between phenotype and 
      repeat size. We performed multivariate linear regression to assess the 
      association of the repeat size with the degree of cerebellar atrophy. Meiotic 
      stability was assessed by Southern blotting on first-degree relatives of 27 
      probands. Finally, somatic instability was investigated by optical genome mapping 
      on cerebellar and frontal cortex and unaffected peripheral tissue from four 
      post-mortem cases. A larger repeat size of both smaller and larger allele was 
      associated with an earlier age at neurological onset [smaller allele hazard ratio 
      (HR) = 2.06, P < 0.001; larger allele HR = 1.53, P < 0.001] and with a higher 
      hazard of developing disabling symptoms, such as dysarthria or dysphagia (smaller 
      allele HR = 3.40, P < 0.001; larger allele HR = 1.71, P = 0.002) or loss of 
      independent walking (smaller allele HR = 2.78, P < 0.001; larger allele HR = 
      1.60; P < 0.001) earlier in disease course. Patients with more complex phenotypes 
      carried larger expansions [smaller allele: complex neuropathy rate ratio (RR) = 
      1.30, P = 0.003; cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome 
      (CANVAS) RR = 1.34, P < 0.001; larger allele: complex neuropathy RR = 1.33, P = 
      0.008; CANVAS RR = 1.31, P = 0.009]. Furthermore, larger repeat expansions in the 
      smaller allele were associated with more pronounced cerebellar vermis atrophy 
      (lobules I-V beta = -1.06, P < 0.001; lobules VI-VII beta = -0.34, P = 0.005). The 
      repeat did not show significant instability during vertical transmission and 
      across different tissues and brain regions. RFC1 repeat size, particularly of the 
      smaller allele, is one of the determinants of variability in RFC1 disease and 
      represents a key prognostic factor to predict disease onset, phenotype and 
      severity. Assessing the repeat size is warranted as part of the diagnostic test 
      for RFC1 expansion.

TI  - AAGGG repeat expansions trigger RFC1-independent synaptic dysregulation in human 
      CANVAS Neurons.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a 
      late onset, recessively inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by biallelic, 
      non-reference pentameric AAGGG(CCCTT) repeat expansions within the second intron 
      of replication factor complex subunit 1 (RFC1). To investigate how these repeats 
      cause disease, we generated CANVAS patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) 
      derived neurons (iNeurons) and utilized calcium imaging and transcriptomic 
      analysis to define repeat-elicited gain-of-function and loss-of-function 
      contributions to neuronal toxicity. AAGGG repeat expansions do not alter neuronal 
      RFC1 splicing, expression, or DNA repair pathway functions. In reporter assays, 
      AAGGG repeats are translated into pentapeptide repeat proteins that selectively 
      accumulate in CANVAS patient brains. However, neither these proteins nor repeat 
      RNA foci were detected in iNeurons, and overexpression of these repeats in 
      isolation did not induce neuronal toxicity. CANVAS iNeurons exhibit defects in 
      neuronal development and diminished synaptic connectivity that is rescued by 
      CRISPR deletion of a single expanded allele. These phenotypic deficits were not 
      replicated by knockdown of RFC1 in control neurons and were not rescued by 
      ectopic expression of RFC1. These findings support a repeat-dependent but 
      RFC1-independent cause of neuronal dysfunction in CANVAS, with important 
      implications for therapeutic development in this currently untreatable condition.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hereditary ataxias (HAs) encompass a diverse and genetically 
      intricate group of rare neurodegenerative disorders, presenting diagnostic 
      challenges. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has significantly improved diagnostic 
      success. This study aimed to elucidate genetic causes of cerebellar ataxia within 
      a diverse Brazilian cohort. METHODS: Biological samples were collected from 
      individuals with sporadic or familial cerebellar ataxia, spanning various ages 
      and phenotypes, excluding common SCAs and Friedreich ataxia. RFC1 biallelic AAGGG 
      repeat expansion was screened in all patients. For AAGGG-negative cases, WES 
      targeting 441 ataxia-related genes was performed, followed by ExpansionHunter 
      analysis for repeat expansions, including the recently described GGC-ZFHX3. 
      Variant classification adhered to ClinGen guidelines, yielding definitive or 
      probable diagnoses. RESULTS: The study involved 76 diverse Brazilian families. 
      16 % received definitive diagnoses, and another 16 % received probable ones. 
      RFC1-related ataxia was predominant, with two definitive cases, followed by KIF1A 
      (one definitive and one probable) and SYNE-1 (two probable). Early-onset cases 
      exhibited higher diagnostic rates. ExpansionHunter improved diagnosis by 4 %.We 
      did not detected GGC-ZFHX3 repeat expansion in this cohort. CONCLUSION: This 
      study highlights diagnostic complexities in cerebellar ataxia, even with advanced 
      genetic methods. RFC1, KIF1A, and SYNE1 emerged as prevalent mutations. ZFHX3 
      repeat expansion seem to be rare in Brazilian population. Early-onset cases 
      showed higher diagnostic success. WES coupled with ExpansionHunter holds promise 
      as a primary diagnostic tool, emphasizing the need for broader NGS accessibility 
      in Brazil.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a 
      late-onset, autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by biallelic 
      AAGGG/ACAGG repeat expansion (AAGGG-exp/ACAGG-exp) in RFC1. The recent 
      identification of patients with CANVAS exhibiting compound heterozygosity for 
      AAGGG-exp and truncating variants supports the loss-of-function of RFC1 in CANVAS 
      patients. We investigated the pathological changes in 2 autopsied patients with 
      CANVAS harboring biallelic ACAGG-exp and AAGGG-exp. RNA fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization of the 2 patients revealed CCTGT- and CCCTT-containing RNA foci, 
      respectively, in neuronal nuclei of tissues with neuronal loss. Our findings 
      suggest that RNA toxicity may be involved in the pathogenesis of CANVAS. ANN

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biallelic intronic AAGGG repeat expansions in the replication factor 
      complex subunit 1 (RFC1) gene were identified as the leading cause of cerebellar 
      ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome. Patients exhibit significant 
      clinical heterogeneity and variable disease course, but no potential biomarker 
      has been identified to date. OBJECTIVES: In this multicenter cross-sectional 
      study, we aimed to evaluate neurofilament light (NfL) chain serum levels in a 
      cohort of RFC1 disease patients and to correlate NfL serum concentrations with 
      clinical phenotype and disease severity. METHODS: Sixty-one patients with 
      genetically confirmed RFC1 disease and 48 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled 
      from six neurological centers. Serum NfL concentration was measured using the 
      single molecule array assay technique. RESULTS: Serum NfL concentration was 
      significantly higher in patients with RFC1 disease compared to age- 
      and-sex-matched HCs (P < 0.0001). NfL level showed a moderate correlation with 
      age in both HCs (r = 0.4353, P = 0.0020) and patients (r = 0.4092, P = 0.0011). 
      Mean NfL concentration appeared to be significantly higher in patients with 
      cerebellar involvement compared to patients without cerebellar dysfunction (27.88 
      vs. 21.84 pg/mL, P = 0.0081). The association between cerebellar involvement and 
      NfL remained significant after controlling for age and sex (beta = 0.260, 
      P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Serum NfL levels are significantly higher in patients 
      with RFC1 disease compared to HCs and correlate with cerebellar involvement. 
      Longitudinal studies are warranted to assess its change over time.

TI  - Investigation of RFC1 tandem nucleotide repeat locus in diverse neurodegenerative 
      outcomes in an Indian cohort.

AB  - An intronic bi-allelic pentanucleotide repeat expansion mutation, 
      (AAGGG)(400-2000), at AAAAG repeat locus in RFC1 gene, is known as underlying 
      genetic cause in cases with cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular 
      areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) and late-onset sporadic ataxia. Biallelic positive 
      cases carry a common recessive risk haplotype, "AAGA," spanning RFC1 gene. In 
      this study, our aim is to find prevalence of bi-allelic (AAGGG)(exp) in Indian 
      ataxia and other neurological disorders and investigate the complexity of RFC1 
      repeat locus and its potential association with neurodegenerative diseases in 
      Indian population-based cohorts. We carried out repeat number and repeat type 
      estimation using flanking PCR and repeat primed PCR (AAAAG/AAAGG/AAGGG) in four 
      Indian disease cohorts and healthy controls. Haplotype assessment of suspected 
      cases was done by genotyping and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Blood samples 
      and consent of all the cases and detailed clinical details of positive cases were 
      collected in collaboration with A.I.I.M.S. Furthermore, comprehension of RFC1 
      repeat locus and risk haplotype analysis in Indian background was performed on 
      the NGS data of Indian healthy controls by ExpansionHunter, ExpansionHunter 
      Denovo, and PHASE analysis, respectively. Genetic screening of RFC1-TNR locus in 
      1998 uncharacterized cases (SCA12: 87; uncharacterized ataxia: 1818, CMT: 93) and 
      564 heterogenous controls showed that the frequency of subjects with bi-allelic 
      (AAGGG)(exp) are 1.15%, < 0.05%, 2.15%, and 0% respectively. Two RFC1 positive 
      sporadic late-onset ataxia cases, one bi-allelic (AAGGG)(exp) and another, 
      (AAAGG)(~700)/(AAGGG)(exp), had recessive risk haplotype and CANVAS symptoms. 
      Long normal alleles, 15-27, are significantly rare in ataxia cohort. In IndiGen 
      control population (IndiGen; N = 1029), long normal repeat range, 15-27, is 
      significantly associated with A(3)G(3) and some rare repeat motifs, AGAGG, AACGG, 
      AAGAG, and AAGGC. Risk-associated "AAGA" haplotype of the original pathogenic 
      expansion of A(2)G(3) was found associated with the A(3)G(3) representing alleles 
      in background population. Apart from bi-allelic (AAGGG)(exp), we report cases 
      with a new pathogenic expansion of (AAAGG)(exp)/(AAGGG)(exp) in RFC1 and 
      recessive risk haplotype. We found different repeat motifs at RFC1 TNR locus, 
      like AAAAG, AAAGG, AAAGGG, AAAAGG, AAGAG, AACGG, AAGGC, AGAGG, and AAGGG, in 
      Indian background population except ACAGG and (AAAGG)(n)/(AAGGG)(n). Our findings 
      will help in further understanding the role of long normal repeat size and 
      different repeat motifs, specifically AAAGG, AAAGGG, and other rare repeat 
      motifs, at the RFC1 locus.

      Expansions.
LID - 10.3390/biom13101546 [doi]
LID - 1546
AB  - A recessive Short Tandem Repeat expansion in RFC1 has been found to be associated 
      with cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), 
      and to be a frequent cause of late onset ataxia and sensory neuropathy. The usual 
      procedure for sizing these expansions is based on Southern Blotting (SB), a 
      time-consuming and a relatively imprecise technique. In this paper, we compare SB 
      with Optical Genome Mapping (OGM), a method for detecting Structural Variants 
      (SVs) based on the measurement of distances between fluorescently labelled 
      probes, for the diagnosis of RFC1 CANVAS and disease spectrum. The two methods 
      are applied to 17 CANVAS patients' blood samples and resulting sizes compared, 
      showing a good agreement. Further, long-read sequencing is used for two patients 
      to investigate the agreement of sizes with either SB or OGM. Our study concludes 
      that OGM represents a viable alternative to SB, allowing for a simpler technique, 
      a more precise sizing of the expansion and ability to expand analysis of SV in 
      the entire genome as opposed to SB which is a locus specific method.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) has 
      recently been attributed to biallelic repeat expansions in RFC1. More recently, 
      the disease entity has expanded to atypical phenotypes, including chronic 
      neuropathy without cerebellar ataxia or vestibular areflexia. Very recently, RFC1 
      expansions were found in patients with Sjogren syndrome who had neuropathy that 
      did not respond to immunotherapy. In this study RFC1 was examined in 240 patients 
      with acute or chronic neuropathies, including 105 with Guillain-Barre syndrome or 
      Miller Fisher syndrome, 76 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating 
      polyneuropathy, and 59 with other types of chronic neuropathy. Biallelic RFC1 
      mutations were found in three patients with immune-mediated neuropathies, 
      including Guillain-Barre syndrome, idiopathic sensory ataxic neuropathy, or 
      anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) neuropathy, who responded to 
      immunotherapies. In addition, a patient with chronic sensory autonomic neuropathy 
      had biallelic mutations, and subclinical changes in Schwann cells on nerve 
      biopsy. In summary, we found CANVAS-related RFC1 mutations in patients with 
      treatable immune-mediated neuropathy or demyelinating neuropathy.

AB  - The well-known eye-of-the-tiger sign features bilateral and symmetrical changes 
      in the globus pallidus, with a central area of high signal and peripheral low 
      signal on T2-weighted MRI. Although formally considered pathognomonic of 
      pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), there are other 
      neurodegenerative or genetic diseases showing similar findings. Cerebellar ataxia 
      with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a late-onset 
      ataxia, that was recently associated with biallelic AAGGG repeat expansion in the 
      RFC1 gene. Although its predominant MRI finding is cerebellar atrophy, there may 
      be other less common associated findings. Our aim is to present two cases of 
      CANVAS with associated (pseudo-)eye-of-the-tiger sign, highlighting the 
      possibility of yet another differential diagnosis for this imaging sign.

      quadruplex or triplex structures.

AB  - Biallelic expansions of various tandem repeat sequence motifs are possible in 
      RFC1 (replication factor C subunit 1), encoding the DNA replication/repair 
      protein RFC1, yet only certain repeat motifs cause cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, 
      and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). CANVAS presents enigmatic puzzles: 
      The pathogenic path for CANVAS neither is known nor is it understood why some, 
      but not all expanded, motifs are pathogenic. The most common pathogenic repeat is 
      (AAGGG)n*(CCCTT)n, whereas (AAAAG)n*(CTTTT)n is the most common nonpathogenic 
      motif. While both intronic motifs can be expanded and transcribed, only r(AAGGG)n 
      is retained in the mutant RFC1 transcript. We show that only the pathogenic forms 
      unusual nucleic acid structures. Specifically, DNA and RNA of the pathogenic 
      d(AAGGG)4 and r(AAGGG)4 form G-quadruplexes in potassium solution. Nonpathogenic 
      repeats did not form G-quadruplexes. Triple-stranded structures are formed by the 
      pathogenic motifs but not by the nonpathogenic motifs. G- and C-richness of the 
      pathogenic strands favor formation of G*G*G*G-tetrads and protonated C+-G 
      Hoogsteen base pairings, involved in quadruplex and triplex structures, 
      respectively, stabilized by increased hydrogen bonds and pi-stacking interactions 
      relative to A-T Hoogsteen pairs that could form by the nonpathogenic motif. The 
      ligand, TMPyP4, binds the pathogenic quadruplexes. Formation of quadruplexes and 
      triplexes by pathogenic repeats supports toxic-DNA and toxic-RNA modes of 
      pathogenesis at the RFC1 gene and the RFC1 transcript. Our findings with short 
      repeats provide insights into the disease specificity of pathogenic repeat motif 
      sequences and reveal nucleic acid structural features that may be pathogenically 
      involved and targeted therapeutically.

TI  - Frequency and phenotypic spectrum of spinocerebellar ataxia 27B and other genetic

PG  - 3828-3833
LID - 10.1111/ene.16039 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dominantly inherited GAA repeat expansions in the 
      fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) gene have recently been shown to cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 27B (SCA27B). We aimed to study the frequency and 
      phenotype of SCA27B in a cohort of patients with unsolved late-onset cerebellar 
      ataxia (LOCA). We also assessed the frequency of SCA27B relative to other 
      genetically defined LOCAs. METHODS: We recruited a consecutive series of 107 
      patients with LOCA, of whom 64 remained genetically undiagnosed. We screened 
      these 64 patients for the FGF14 GAA repeat expansion. We next analysed the 
      frequency of SCA27B relative to other genetically defined forms of LOCA in the 
      cohort of 107 patients. RESULTS: Eighteen of 64 patients (28%) carried an FGF14 
      (GAA)(>/=250) expansion. The median (range) age at onset was 62.5 (39-72) years. 
      The most common clinical features included gait ataxia (100%) and mild cerebellar 
      dysarthria (67%). In addition, episodic symptoms and downbeat nystagmus were 
      present in 39% (7/18) and 37% (6/16) of patients, respectively. SCA27B was the 
      most common cause of LOCA in our cohort (17%, 18/107). Among patients with 
      genetically defined LOCA, SCA27B was the main cause of pure ataxia, RFC1-related 
      disease of ataxia with neuropathy, and SPG7 of ataxia with spasticity. 
      CONCLUSION: We showed that SCA27B is the most common cause of LOCA in our cohort. 
      Our results support the use of FGF14 GAA repeat expansion screening as a 
      first-tier genetic test in patients with LOCA.

TI  - Pathogenic CANVAS (AAGGG)(n) repeats stall DNA replication due to the formation 
      of alternative DNA structures.

AB  - CANVAS is a recently characterized repeat expansion disease, most commonly caused 
      by homozygous expansions of an intronic (A(2)G(3))(n) repeat in the RFC1 gene. 
      There are a multitude of repeat motifs found in the human population at this 
      locus, some of which are pathogenic and others benign. In this study, we 
      conducted structure-functional analyses of the main pathogenic (A(2)G(3))(n) and 
      the main nonpathogenic (A(4)G)(n) repeats. We found that the pathogenic, but not 
      the nonpathogenic, repeat presents a potent, orientation-dependent impediment to 
      DNA polymerization in vitro. The pattern of the polymerization blockage is 
      consistent with triplex or quadruplex formation in the presence of magnesium or 
      potassium ions, respectively. Chemical probing of both repeats in supercoiled DNA 
      reveals triplex H-DNA formation by the pathogenic repeat. Consistently, 
      bioinformatic analysis of the S1-END-seq data from human cell lines shows 
      preferential H-DNA formation genome-wide by (A(2)G(3))(n) motifs over (A(4)G)(n) 
      motifs in vivo. Finally, the pathogenic, but not the non-pathogenic, repeat 
      stalls replication fork progression in yeast and human cells. We hypothesize that 
      CANVAS-causing (A(2)G(3))(n) repeat represents a challenge to genome stability by 
      folding into alternative DNA structures that stall DNA replication.

TI  - Frequency and Phenotype of RFC1 Repeat Expansions in Bilateral Vestibulopathy.
PG  - e1001-e1013
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000207553 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bilateral vestibulopathy (BVP) is a chronic 
      debilitating neurologic disorder with no monogenic cause established so far 
      despite familiar presentations. We hypothesized that replication factor complex 
      subunit 1 (RFC1) repeat expansions might present a recurrent monogenic cause of 
      BVP. METHODS: The study involved RFC1 screening and in-depth neurologic, 
      vestibulo-oculomotor, and disease evolution phenotyping of 168 consecutive 
      patients with idiopathic at least "probable BVP" from a tertiary referral center 
      for balance disorders, with127 of them meeting current diagnostic criteria of BVP 
      (Barany Society Classification). RESULTS: Biallelic AAGGG repeat expansions in 
      RFC1 were identified in 10/127 patients (8%) with BVP and 1/41 with probable BVP. 
      Heterozygous expansions in 10/127 patients were enriched compared with those in 
      reference populations. RFC1-related BVP manifested at a median age of 60 years 
      (range 34-72 years) and co-occurred predominantly with mild polyneuropathy 
      (10/11). Additional cerebellar involvement (7/11) was subtle and limited to 
      oculomotor signs in early stages, below recognition of classic cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome. Clear dysarthria, appendicular 
      ataxia, or cerebellar atrophy developed 6-8 years after onset. Dysarthria, absent 
      patellar reflexes, and downbeat nystagmus best discriminated RFC1-positive BVP 
      from RFC1-negative BVP, but neither sensory symptoms nor fine motor problems. 
      Video head impulse gains of patients with RFC1-positive BVP were lower relative 
      to those of patients with RFC1-negative BVP and decreased until 10 years disease 
      duration, indicating a potential progression and outcome marker for RFC1-disease. 
      DISCUSSION: This study identifies RFC1 as the first-and frequent-monogenic cause 
      of BVP. It characterizes RFC1-related BVP as part of the multisystemic evolution 
      of RFC1 spectrum disease, with implications for designing natural history studies 
      and future treatment trials. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides 
      Class II evidence that RFC1 repeat expansions cause BVP.

TI  - Normal and pathogenic variation of RFC1 repeat expansions: implications for 
      clinical diagnosis.
PG  - 5060-5069
LID - 10.1093/brain/awad240 [doi]
AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is an 
      autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease, usually caused by biallelic AAGGG 
      repeat expansions in RFC1. In this study, we leveraged whole genome sequencing 
      data from nearly 10 000 individuals recruited within the Genomics England 
      sequencing project to investigate the normal and pathogenic variation of the RFC1 
      repeat. We identified three novel repeat motifs, AGGGC (n = 6 from five 
      families), AAGGC (n = 2 from one family) and AGAGG (n = 1), associated with 
      CANVAS in the homozygous or compound heterozygous state with the common 
      pathogenic AAGGG expansion. While AAAAG, AAAGGG and AAGAG expansions appear to be 
      benign, we revealed a pathogenic role for large AAAGG repeat configuration 
      expansions (n = 5). Long-read sequencing was used to characterize the entire 
      repeat sequence, and six patients exhibited a pure AGGGC expansion, while the 
      other patients presented complex motifs with AAGGG or AAAGG interruptions. All 
      pathogenic motifs appeared to have arisen from a common haplotype and were 
      predicted to form highly stable G quadruplexes, which have previously been 
      demonstrated to affect gene transcription in other conditions. The assessment of 
      these novel configurations is warranted in CANVAS patients with negative or 
      inconclusive genetic testing. Particular attention should be paid to carriers of 
      compound AAGGG/AAAGG expansions when the AAAGG motif is very large (>500 repeats) 
      or the AAGGG motif is interrupted. Accurate sizing and full sequencing of the 
      satellite repeat with long-read sequencing is recommended in clinically selected 
      cases to enable accurate molecular diagnosis and counsel patients and their 
      families.

TI  - Can CANVAS due to RFC1 biallelic expansions present with pure ataxia?
PG  - 171-174
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2023-331381 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biallelic expansion of AAGGG in the replication factor complex 
      subunit 1 (RFC1) was identified as a major cause of cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy 
      (sensory ganglionopathy, or SG) and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). We 
      wanted to clarify if RFC1 expansions can present with pure ataxia and if such 
      expansions could be responsible for some cases where an alternative diagnosis had 
      been made. METHODS: We identified patients with a combination of ataxia and SG 
      and no other cause found, patients where an alternative diagnosis had been made, 
      and patients with pure ataxia. Testing for RFC1 expansions was done using 
      established methodology. RESULTS: Among 54 patients with otherwise idiopathic 
      sporadic ataxia without SG, none was found to have RFC1 expansions. Among 38 
      patients with cerebellar ataxia and SG in which all other causes were excluded, 
      71% had RFC1 expansions. Among 27 patients with cerebellar ataxia and SG 
      diagnosed with coeliac disease or gluten sensitivity, 15% had RFC1 expansions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Isolated cerebellar ataxia without SG makes the diagnosis of CANVAS 
      due to RFC1 expansions highly improbable, but CANVAS is frequently the cause of 
      the combination of idiopathic cerebellar ataxia with SG. It is important to 
      screen patients diagnosed with other causes of acquired ataxia and SG as a small 
      percentage were found to have RFC1 expansions.

TI  - Intronic FGF14 GAA repeat expansions are a common cause of ataxia syndromes with 
      neuropathy and bilateral vestibulopathy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intronic GAA repeat expansions in the fibroblast growth factor 14 
      gene (FGF14) have recently been identified as a common cause of ataxia with 
      potential phenotypic overlap with RFC1-related cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). Our objective was to report on the 
      frequency of intronic FGF14 GAA repeat expansions in patients with an unexplained 
      CANVAS-like phenotype. METHODS: We recruited 45 patients negative for biallelic 
      RFC1 repeat expansions with a combination of cerebellar ataxia plus peripheral 
      neuropathy and/or bilateral vestibulopathy (BVP), and genotyped the FGF14 repeat 
      locus. Phenotypic features of GAA-FGF14-positive versus GAA-FGF14-negative 
      patients were compared. RESULTS: Frequency of FGF14 GAA repeat expansions was 38% 
      (17/45) in the entire cohort, 38% (5/13) in the subgroup with cerebellar ataxia 
      plus polyneuropathy, 43% (9/21) in the subgroup with cerebellar ataxia plus BVP 
      and 27% (3/11) in patients with all three features. BVP was observed in 75% 
      (12/16) of GAA-FGF14-positive patients. Polyneuropathy was at most mild and of 
      mixed sensorimotor type in six of eight GAA-FGF14-positive patients. Family 
      history of ataxia (59% vs 15%; p=0.007) was significantly more frequent and 
      permanent cerebellar dysarthria (12% vs 54%; p=0.009) significantly less frequent 
      in GAA-FGF14-positive than in GAA-FGF14-negative patients. Age at onset was 
      inversely correlated to the size of the repeat expansion (Pearson's r, -0.67; 
      R(2)=0.45; p=0.0031). CONCLUSIONS: GAA-FGF14-related disease is a common cause of 
      cerebellar ataxia with polyneuropathy and/or BVP, and should be included in the 
      differential diagnosis of RFC1 CANVAS and disease spectrum.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a 
      progressive neurodegenerative disorder predominantly caused by biallelic AAGGG 
      expansions in the second intron of the RFC1 gene. Here, we used a simultaneous 
      reprogramming and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing approach to generate three patient 
      iPSC lines with homozygous AAGGG expansions along with three heterozygous gene 
      corrected iPSC lines. The iPSC lines expressed pluripotency markers, had a normal 
      karyotype, and were able to differentiate into all three embryonic germ layers. 
      These mutant and corrected iPSC lines will be a valuable tool for studying the 
      molecular mechanisms underlying CANVAS.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pathogenic expansions in RFC1 have been described as a cause of a 
      spectrum of disorders including late-onset ataxia, chronic cough, and cerebellar 
      ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). Sensory 
      neuronopathy/neuropathy appears to be a major symptom of RFC1-disorder, and RFC1 
      expansions are common in patients with sensory chronic idiopathic axonal 
      neuropathy or sensory ganglionopathy. We aimed to investigate RFC1 expansions in 
      patients with suspected RFC1-related disease followed-up in a Neuromuscular 
      Diseases Unit, with a particular interest in the involvement of the peripheral 
      nervous system. METHODS: We recruited twenty consecutive patients based on the 
      presence of at least two of the following features: progressive ataxia, sensory 
      neuropathy/neuronopathy, vestibulopathy and chronic cough. Medical records were 
      retrospectively reviewed for a detailed clinical description. More extensive 
      phenotyping of the RFC1-positive patients and clinical comparison between RFC1 
      positive and negative patients were performed. RESULTS: Biallelic AAGGG repeat 
      expansions were identified in 13 patients (65%). The most frequent symptoms were 
      chronic cough and sensory disturbances in the lower extremities (12/13). Only 4 
      patients (31%) had complete CANVAS. The phenotypes were sensory ataxia and 
      sensory symptoms in extremities in 4/13; sensory ataxia, sensory symptoms, and 
      vestibulopathy in 3/13; sensory symptoms plus chronic cough in 2/13. Chronic 
      cough and isolated sensory neuronopathy were significantly more prevalent in 
      RFC1-positive patients. CONCLUSION: Pathogenic RFC1 expansions are a common cause 
      of sensory neuropathy/neuronopathy and should be considered in the approach to 
      these patients. Identification of key symptoms or detailed interpretation of 
      nerve conduction studies may improve patient selection for genetic testing.

TI  - Association of biallelic RFC1 expansion with early-onset Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 1256-1261
LID - 10.1111/ene.15717 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The biallelic repeat expansion (AAGGG)(exp) in the 
      replication factor C subunit 1 gene (RFC1) is a frequent cause of cerebellar 
      ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) as well as 
      late-onset ataxia. The clinical spectrum of RFC1 disease has expanded since the 
      first identification of biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) and includes now various 
      nonclassical phenotypes. Biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) in RFC1 in patients with 
      clinically confirmed Parkinson's disease (PD) has recently been found. METHODS: A 
      nationwide cohort of 273 Finnish patients with early-onset PD was examined for 
      the biallelic intronic expansion in RFC1. The expansion (AAGGG)(exp) was first 
      screened using extra long polymerase chain reactions (Extra Large-PCRs) and 
      flanking multiplex PCR. The presence of biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) was then confirmed 
      by repeat-primed PCR and, finally, the repeat length was determined by long-read 
      sequencing. RESULTS: Three patients were found with the biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) in 
      RFC1 giving a frequency of 1.10% (0.23%-3.18%; 95% confidence interval). The 
      three patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of PD, none of them had ataxia 
      or neuropathy, and only one patient had a mild vestibular dysfunction. The age at 
      onset of PD symptoms was 40-48 years and their disease course had been 
      unremarkable apart from the early onset. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that 
      (AAGGG)(exp) in RFC1 is a rare cause of early-onset PD. Other populations should 
      be examined in order to determine whether our findings are specific to the 
      Finnish population.

TI  - Cognitive Impairment in a Complex Family With AAGGG and ACAGG Repeat Expansions 
      in RFC1 Detected by ExpansionHunter Denovo.
PG  - e682
LID - 10.1212/NXG.0000000000000682 [doi]
LID - e682
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We investigated the genetic basis and brain metabolism 
      and blood flow of a Japanese family with spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD), with 
      multiple affected members for 3 generations. METHODS: After excluding DNA repeat 
      expansion (RE) of common SCD genes by fragment analysis, we performed whole-exome 
      sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Homozygosity mapping was 
      performed using these data. REs were investigated with WGS data using 
      ExpansionHunter Denovo and Expansion Hunter. RESULTS: WES and WGS were unable to 
      identify likely pathogenic variants, and homozygosity mapping failed to narrow 
      down the locus. However, ExpansionHunter Denovo detected REs in intron 2 of the 
      RFC1 gene and led us to the diagnosis of RFC1-related disorders. Subsequent 
      repeat-primed PCR and Southern blot hybridization analyses revealed that 3 of 6 
      patients and 1 suspected individual had expansions of AAGGG ((AAGGG)(exp)) and 
      (ACAGG)(exp) repeats in a compound heterozygous state and 3 had a homozygous 
      (ACAGG)(exp). The patients showed a variety of clinical features, including 
      adult-onset ataxia, sensorimotor neuropathy, head tremor, parkinsonism, dystonia, 
      and cognitive impairment. A comparison of previous reports with those of the 
      family in study suggested that motor neuropathy could be a feature of compound 
      heterozygous patients and biallelic (ACAGG)(exp) patients. Cognitive function 
      tests showed cognitive impairment with a predominance of frontal lobe 
      dysfunction. Examination of MRI, SPECT, and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET showed 
      clear cortical damage with frontal lobe predominance in 1 case, but no cerebral 
      damage was evident in the other 2 cases. DISCUSSION: Our report shows the 
      usefulness of WGS and RE detection tools for SCD of unknown cause. The studied 
      family with RFC1-related disorders included patients with (ACAGG)(exp) and 
      (AAGGG)(exp) in a compound heterozygous state and was characterized by motor 
      neuropathy. Based on the results of cognitive function tests and imaging studies, 
      1 patient presented with cognitive impairment due to frontal lobe metabolic 
      changes, but there were also patients who presented with cognitive impairment 
      without apparent cerebral metabolic or blood flow, suggesting that other factors 
      are also associated with cognitive impairment.

TI  - Truncating Variants in RFC1 in Cerebellar Ataxia, Neuropathy, and Vestibular 
      Areflexia Syndrome.
PG  - e543-e554
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000201486 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia 
      syndrome (CANVAS) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized by adult-onset and slowly progressive sensory neuropathy, 
      cerebellar dysfunction, and vestibular impairment. In most cases, the disease is 
      caused by biallelic (AAGGG)(n) repeat expansions in the second intron of the 
      replication factor complex subunit 1 (RFC1). However, a small number of cases 
      with typical CANVAS do not carry the common biallelic repeat expansion. The 
      objective of this study was to expand the genotypic spectrum of CANVAS by 
      identifying sequence variants in RFC1-coding region associated with this 
      condition. METHODS: Fifteen individuals diagnosed with CANVAS and carrying only 1 
      heterozygous (AAGGG)(n) expansion in RFC1 underwent whole-genome sequencing or 
      whole-exome sequencing to test for the presence of a second variant in RFC1 or 
      other unrelated gene. To assess the effect of truncating variants on RFC1 
      expression, we tested the level of RFC1 transcript and protein on patients' 
      derived cell lines. RESULTS: We identified 7 patients from 5 unrelated families 
      with clinically defined CANVAS carrying a heterozygous (AAGGG)(n) expansion 
      together with a second truncating variant in trans in RFC1, which included the 
      following: c.1267C>T (p.Arg423Ter), c.1739_1740del (p.Lys580SerfsTer9), c.2191del 
      (p.Gly731GlufsTer6), and c.2876del (p.Pro959GlnfsTer24). Patient fibroblasts 
      containing the c.1267C>T (p.Arg423Ter) or c.2876del (p.Pro959GlnfsTer24) variants 
      demonstrated nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and reduced RFC1 transcript and 
      protein. DISCUSSION: Our report expands the genotype spectrum of RFC1 disease. 
      Full RFC1 sequencing is recommended in cases affected by typical CANVAS and 
      carrying monoallelic (AAGGG)(n) expansions. In addition, it sheds further light 
      on the pathogenesis of RFC1 CANVAS because it supports the existence of a 
      loss-of-function mechanism underlying this complex neurodegenerative condition.

TI  - New Cerebellar Ataxia, Neuropathy, Vestibular Areflexia Syndrome cases are caused 
      by the presence of a nonsense variant in compound heterozygosity with the 
      pathogenic repeat expansion in the RFC1 gene.
PG  - 236-241
LID - 10.1111/cge.14249 [doi]
AB  - The biallelic pathogenic repeat (AAGGG)(400-2000) intronic expansion in the RFC1 
      gene has been recently described as the cause of cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) and as a major cause of late-onset ataxia. 
      Since then, many heterozygous carriers have been identified, with an estimated 
      allele frequency of 0.7% to 4% in the healthy population. Here, we describe in 
      two affected CANVAS sisters the presence of the nonsense c.724C > T p.(Arg242*) 
      variant in compound heterozygosity with the pathogenic repeat expansion in the 
      RFC1 gene. Further RNA analysis demonstrated a reduced expression of the 
      p.Arg242* allele in patients confirming an efficient nonsense-mediated mRNA 
      decay. We also highlight the importance of considering the sequencing of the RFC1 
      gene for the diagnosis, especially in patients with CANVAS diagnosis carriers of 
      the AAGGG repeat expansion.

TI  - Parallel in-depth analysis of repeat expansions in ataxia patients by long-read 
      sequencing.

LID - 10.1093/brain/awac377 [doi]
AB  - Instability of simple DNA repeats has been known as a common cause of hereditary 
      ataxias for over 20 years. Routine genetic diagnostics of these phenotypically 
      similar diseases still rely on an iterative workflow for quantification of repeat 
      units by PCR-based methods of limited precision. We established and validated 
      clinical nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing, an amplification-free method for 
      simultaneous analysis of 10 repeat loci associated with clinically overlapping 
      hereditary ataxias. The method combines target enrichment by CRISPR-Cas9, Oxford 
      Nanopore long-read sequencing and a bioinformatics pipeline using the tools 
      STRique and Megalodon for parallel detection of length, sequence, methylation and 
      composition of the repeat loci. Clinical nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing 
      allowed for the precise and parallel analysis of 10 repeat loci associated with 
      adult-onset ataxia and revealed additional parameter such as FMR1 promotor 
      methylation and repeat sequence required for diagnosis at the same time. Using 
      clinical nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing we analysed 100 clinical samples of 
      undiagnosed ataxia patients and identified causative repeat expansions in 28 
      patients. Parallel repeat analysis enabled a molecular diagnosis of ataxias 
      independent of preconceptions on the basis of clinical presentation. Biallelic 
      expansions within RFC1 were identified as the most frequent cause of ataxia. We 
      characterized the RFC1 repeat composition of all patients and identified a novel 
      repeat motif, AGGGG. Our results highlight the power of clinical nanopore 
      Cas9-targeted sequencing as a readily expandable workflow for the in-depth 
      analysis and diagnosis of phenotypically overlapping repeat expansion disorders.

TI  - Severe distinct dysautonomia in RFC1-related disease associated with 
      Parkinsonism.
PG  - 311-315
LID - 10.1111/jns.12515 [doi]
AB  - Biallelic repeat expansions in replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) have 
      recently been found to cause cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular 
      areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). Additional features that have been described include 
      Parkinsonism and a multiple system atrophy (MSA)-like syndrome. CANVAS can 
      include features of dysautonomia, but they are much milder than typically seen in 
      MSA. We report a detailed autonomic phenotype of multisystem RFC1-related disease 
      presenting initially as CANVAS. Our patient presented aged 61 with a sensory 
      ataxic neuropathy who rapidly developed widespread autonomic failure and 
      Parkinsonism. The autonomic profile was of a mixed pre- and post-ganglionic 
      syndrome with progressive involvement of sympathetic and parasympathetic 
      cardiovascular and sudomotor function. The Parkinsonism did not respond to 
      levodopa. We present a patient with CANVAS and biallelic RFC1 expansions who 
      developed Parkinsonism with severe autonomic involvement similar to that seen in 
      classical MSA. The link between MSA and CANVAS remains uncertain.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The biallelic repeat expansion (AAGGG)(exp) in RFC1 causes 
      cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). 
      Recently, cognitive impairment has been reported in patients with CANVAS and a 
      broader neurodegenerative process associated with RFC1 has been suggested. 
      Furthermore, rare cases of multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or CANVAS with features of dementia with Lewy 
      bodies have been found. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the biallelic 
      (AAGGG)(exp) is associated with neurodegeneration manifested as cognitive 
      symptoms and that atypical RFC1 disease may be found among patients with 
      cognitive disorder. METHODS: Clinical data on nine patients with biallelic 
      (AAGGG)(exp) were reviewed and 564 patients with Alzheimer's disease or 
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD) were investigated for biallelic RFC1 (AAGGG)(exp). 
      RESULTS: Five patients with biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) were found with a cognitive 
      impairment and in four of them the phenotype resembled FTD. However, biallelic 
      (AAGGG)(exp) was not detected among patients with Alzheimer's disease or FTD. 
      CONCLUSION: Cognitive impairment is a feature in patients with the biallelic 
      (AAGGG)(exp), but the pathogenic expansion seems to be rare in patients with 
      dementia. Studies on patients with diverse phenotypes would be useful to further 
      explore the involvement of RFC1 in neuronal degeneration and to identify atypical 
      phenotypes, which should be taken into account in clinical practice.

AB  - Non-coding repeat expansions within RFC1 and NOTCH2NLC genes have lately been 
      linked to multisystem neurodegenerative diseases, which also shed light on yet 
      undiagnosed patients with inherited peripheral neuropathies. The aim of this 
      study was to identify the genetic basis of patients with hereditary sensory and 
      autonomic neuropathy (HSAN). We collected 79 unrelated DNA samples clinically 
      suspected with HSAN from multiple regions of Japan. Mutation screening was first 
      performed using gene panel sequencing and whole-exome sequencing. 
      Pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were identified from genes of WNK1/HSN2 (6 
      cases), SCN9A (3 cases), NTRK1 (3 cases), and DNMT1 (2 cases). Subsequently, 
      long-range flanking PCR and repeat-primed PCR were applied to analyze repeat 
      expansions in RFC1 and NOTCH2NLC. Bi-allelic RFC1 repeat expansions were detected 
      from 20 adult-onset HSAN patients, consisting of [(AAGGG)exp/(AAGGG)exp] (8 
      cases), [(ACAGG)exp/(ACAGG)exp] (8 cases), and [(AAGGG)exp/(ACAGG)exp] (4 cases). 
      GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC was found in 1 case. Single-nucleotide 
      variant-based haplotype analysis of patients harboring disease-associated repeat 
      expansions in RFC1 revealed distinguishable haplotypes among subgroups with 
      different repeat genotypes. These findings substantially redefine the genetic 
      spectrum of HSAN, where multi-type RFC1 repeat expansions account for 25.3% of 
      all patients, highlighting the necessity of genetic screening, particularly for 
      adult-onset patients.

AB  - In 2019, a biallelic pentanucleotide repeat expansion in the gene encoding 
      replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) was reported as a cause of cerebellar 
      ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). In addition, 
      biallelic expansions were shown to account for up to 22% of cases with late-onset 
      ataxia. Since this discovery, the phenotypic spectrum reported to be associated 
      with RFC1 expansions has extended beyond the initial conditions to include pure 
      cerebellar ataxia, isolated somatosensory impairment, combinations of the 2, and 
      parkinsonism, leading to a potentially broad differential diagnosis. Genetic 
      studies suggest RFC1 expansions may be the most common genetic cause of ataxia 
      and are likely underdiagnosed. This review summarizes the current molecular and 
      clinical knowledge of RFC1-related disease, with a focus on the evaluation of 
      recent phenotype associations and highlighting the current challenges in clinical 
      pathways to diagnosis and molecular testing.

AB  - The recessive intronic pentanucleotide repeat AAGGG expansion of replication 
      factor complex subunit 1 (RFC1) is associated with cerebellar ataxia, sensory 
      neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome. And the clinical spectrum has been 
      continuously expanding. We conducted this study to demonstrate the clinical and 
      genetic features of a large-scale case series of Japanese patients with 
      cerebellar ataxia with RFC1 repeat expansions. We examined 1,289 Japanese 
      patients with cerebellar ataxia and analyzed RFC1 repeat expansions in 840 
      patients, excluding those with genetic diagnoses or an autosomal dominant 
      inheritance pattern. For individuals where no product was obtained by flanking 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR), repeat-primed PCR was performed using primers 
      specific for the following four repeat motifs: AAAAG, AAAGG, AAGGG, and ACAGG. 
      RFC1 analysis revealed multitype biallelic pathogenic repeat expansions in 15 
      patients, including (AAGGG)exp/(AAGGG)exp in seven patients, 
      (ACAGG)exp/(ACAGG)exp in three patients, (AAGGG)exp/(ACAGG)exp in four patients, 
      and (AAGGG)exp/(AAAGG)(15)(AAGGG)exp in one patient. Clinical analysis showed 
      various combinations of cerebellar ataxia, vestibular dysfunction, neuropathy, 
      cognitive decline, autonomic dysfunction, chronic cough, pyramidal tract 
      disorder, parkinsonism, involuntary movement, and muscle fasciculation. 
      Pathological RFC1 repeat expansions account for 1.8% (15/840) of undiagnosed 
      patients with cerebellar ataxia and sporadic/recessive/unclassified inheritance. 
      Screening of RFC1 repeat expansions should be considered in patients with 
      cerebellar ataxia, irrespective of their subtype and onset age.

TI  - Comprehensive Genetic Analyses of Inherited Peripheral Neuropathies in Japan: 
      Making Early Diagnosis Possible.

LID - 1546
AB  - Various genomic variants were linked to inherited peripheral neuropathies (IPNs), 
      including large duplication/deletion and repeat expansion, making genetic 
      diagnosis challenging. This large case series aimed to identify the genetic 
      characteristics of Japanese patients with IPNs. We collected data on 2695 IPN 
      cases throughout Japan, in which PMP22 copy number variation (CNV) was 
      pre-excluded. Genetic analyses were performed using DNA microarrays, 
      next-generation sequencing-based gene panel sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, 
      CNV analysis, and RFC1 repeat expansion analysis. The overall diagnostic rate and 
      the genetic spectrum of patients were summarized. We identified 909 cases with 
      suspected IPNs, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. The most common 
      causative genes were MFN2, GJB1, MPZ, and MME. MFN2 was the most common cause for 
      early-onset patients, whereas GJB1 and MPZ were the leading causes of 
      middle-onset and late-onset patients, respectively. Meanwhile, GJB1 and MFN2 were 
      leading causes for demyelinating and axonal subtypes, respectively. Additionally, 
      we identified CNVs in MPZ and GJB1 genes and RFC1 repeat expansions. 
      Comprehensive genetic analyses explicitly demonstrated the genetic basis of our 
      IPN case series. A further understanding of the clinical characteristics of IPN 
      and genetic spectrum would assist in developing efficient genetic testing 
      strategies and facilitate early diagnosis.

PG  - 3770-3775

AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is an 
      inherited late-onset neurological disease caused by bi-allelic AAGGG 
      pentanucleotide expansions within intron 2 of RFC1. Despite extensive studies, 
      the pathophysiological mechanism of these intronic expansions remains elusive. We 
      screened by clinical exome sequencing two unrelated patients presenting with 
      late-onset ataxia. A repeat-primer polymerase chain reaction was used for RFC1 
      AAGGG intronic expansion identification. RFC1 mRNA expression was assessed by 
      quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We identified the 
      first two CANVAS affected patients who are compound heterozygous for RFC1 
      truncating variants (p.Arg388* and c.575delA, respectively) and a pathological 
      AAGGG expansion. RFC1 expression studies in whole blood showed a significant 
      reduction of RFC1 mRNA for both patients compared to three patients with 
      bi-allelic RFC1 expansions. In conclusion, this observation provides clues that 
      suggest bi-allelic RFC1 conditional loss-of-function as the cause of the disease.

TI  - Prevalence of intronic repeat expansions in RFC1 in Dutch patients with CANVAS 
      and adult-onset ataxia.
PG  - 6086-6093
LID - 10.1007/s00415-022-11275-9 [doi]
AB  - Recently, an intronic biallelic (AAGGG)(n) repeat expansion in RFC1 was shown to 
      be a cause of CANVAS and adult-onset ataxia in multiple populations. As the 
      prevalence of the RFC1 repeat expansion in Dutch cases was unknown, we 
      retrospectively tested 9 putative CANVAS cases and two independent cohorts (A and 
      B) of 395 and 222 adult-onset ataxia cases, respectively, using the previously 
      published protocol and, for the first time optical genome mapping to determine 
      the size of the expanded RFC1 repeat. We identified the biallelic (AAGGG)(n) 
      repeat expansion in 5/9 (55%) putative CANVAS patients and in 10/617 (1.6%; 
      cohorts A + B) adult-onset ataxia patients. In addition to the AAGGG repeat 
      motif, we observed a putative GAAGG repeat motif in the repeat expansion with 
      unknown significance in two adult-onset ataxia patients. All the expanded 
      (AAGGG)(n) repeats identified were in the range of 800-1299 repeat units. The 
      intronic biallelic RFC1 repeat expansion thus explains a number of the Dutch 
      adult-onset ataxia cases that display the main clinical features of CANVAS, and 
      particularly when ataxia is combined with neuropathy. The yield of screening for 
      RFC1 expansions in unselected cohorts is relatively low. To increase the current 
      diagnostic yield in ataxia patients, we suggest adding RFC1 screening to the 
      genetic diagnostic workflow by using advanced techniques that attain long 
      fragments.

AB  - We screened 62 late-onset ataxia patients for the AAGGG pathological expansion in 
      the RFC-1 gene that, when biallelic, causes Cerebellar Ataxia, Neuropathy, 
      Vestibular Areflexia Syndrome (CANVAS). Nine patients tested positive. Six had a 
      previous diagnosis of sporadic adult-onset ataxia (SAOA) and three of multisystem 
      atrophy type C (MSA-C). Further six patients were heterozygous for the 
      pathological RFC-1 expansion, four with an initial diagnosis of MSA-C and two of 
      SAOA. In comparison with CANVAS, MSA-C patients had faster progression and 
      shorter disease duration to walking with aids. An abnormal DaTscan does not seem 
      to contribute to differential diagnosis between CANVAS and MSA-C.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Biallelic intronic AAGGG repeat expansion in the replication factor 
      C subunit 1 (RFC1) gene was recently identified in two/third of patients with 
      cerebellar ataxia, sensory neuropathy, and bilateral vestibular areflexia 
      syndrome (CANVAS). The phenotypic spectrum has expanded since (i.e., 
      parkinsonism, motor neuron involvement, cognitive decline); no behavioral 
      symptoms have been reported yet. CASE REPORT: We report an Italian family that 
      met the diagnostic criteria for CANVAS, and RFC1-expansion was detected in five 
      of seven. All the affected members presented behavioral-psychiatric symptoms 
      (anxiety, panic attacks, alcohol abuse) before the multisystemic RFC1-expansion 
      manifestation. The disease course was progressive, with ataxia and 
      behavioral-cognitive aspects as the most disabling symptoms. CONCLUSION: These 
      behavioral-cognitive observations may broaden the RFC1-expansion phenotypic 
      spectrum and highlight the importance of investigating the whole non-motor 
      symptoms in ataxic patients.

PG  - e32546
LID - 10.1002/brb3.2546 [doi]
LID - e32546
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association between disease duration and the 
      severity of bilateral vestibulopathy in individuals with complete or incomplete 
      CANVAS (Cerebellar Ataxia with Neuropathy and Vestibular Areflexia Syndrome) and 
      biallelic RFC1 repeat expansions. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of clinical 
      data and the vestibulo-ocular reflex quantified by the video head impulse test in 
      20 patients with confirmed biallelic RFC1 repeat expansions. RESULTS: 
      Vestibulo-ocular reflex gain at first admittance 6.9 +/- 5.0 years after disease 
      onset was 0.16 [0.15-0.31] (median [interquartile range]). Cross-sectional 
      analysis revealed that gain reduction was associated with disease duration. 
      Follow-up measurements were available for ten individuals: eight of them 
      exhibited a progressive decrease of the vestibulo-ocular reflex gain over time. 
      At the first visit, six of all patients (30%) did not show clinical signs of 
      cerebellar ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a pathological horizontal head 
      impulse test, which can easily be obtained in many outpatient clinics, as a sign 
      of bilateral vestibulopathy in genetically confirmed CANVAS that can precede 
      clinically accessible cerebellar ataxia at least in a subset of patients. The 
      presumably continuous decline over time possibly reflects the neurodegenerative 
      character of the disease. Thus, genetic testing for RFC1 mutations in (isolated) 
      bilateral vestibulopathy might allow disease detection before the onset of 
      cerebellar signs. Further studies including a wider spectrum of vestibular 
      function tests are warranted in a prospective design.

TI  - Repeat conformation heterogeneity in cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular 
      areflexia syndrome.
PG  - 1139-1150
LID - 10.1093/brain/awab363 [doi]
AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a 
      late-onset, slow-progressing multisystem neurodegenerative disorder. Biallelic 
      AAGGG repeat expansion in RFC1 has been identified as causative of this disease, 
      and repeat conformation heterogeneity (ACAGG repeat) was also recently implied. 
      To molecularly characterize this disease in Japanese patients with adult-onset 
      ataxia, we accumulated and screened 212 candidate families by an integrated 
      approach consisting of flanking PCR, repeat-primed PCR, Southern blotting and 
      long-read sequencing using Sequel II, GridION or PromethION. We identified 16 
      patients from 11 families, of whom seven had ACAGG expansions 
      [(ACAGG)exp/(ACAGG)exp] (ACAGG homozygotes), two had ACAGG and AAGGG expansions 
      [(ACAGG)exp/(AAGGG)exp] (ACAGG/AAGGG compound heterozygotes) and seven had AAGGG 
      expansions [(AAGGG)exp/(AAGGG)exp] (AAGGG homozygotes). The overall detection 
      rate was 5.2% (11/212 families including one family having two expansion 
      genotypes). Long-read sequencers revealed the entire sequence of both AAGGG and 
      ACAGG repeat expansions at the nucleotide level of resolution. Clinical 
      assessment and neuropathology results suggested that patients with ACAGG 
      expansions have similar clinical features to previously reported patients with 
      homozygous AAGGG expansions, although motor neuron involvement was more notable 
      in patients with ACAGG expansions (even if one allele was involved). Furthermore, 
      a later age of onset and slower clinical progression were implied in patients 
      with ACAGG/AAGGG compound heterozygous expansions compared with either ACAGG or 
      AAGGG homozygotes in our very limited cohort. Our study clearly shows the 
      occurrence of repeat conformation heterogeneity, with possible different impacts 
      on the affected nervous systems. The difference in disease onset and progression 
      between compound heterozygotes and homozygotes might also be suspected but with 
      very limited certainty due to the small sample number of cases in our study. 
      Studies of additional patients are needed to confirm this.

TI  - Expanding the Clinical Spectrum of RFC1 Gene Mutations.
PG  - 167-170
LID - 10.14802/jmd.21117 [doi]
AB  - Biallelic intronic repeat expansion in the replication factor complex unit 1 
      (RFC1) gene has recently been described as a cause of late onset ataxia with 
      degeneration of the cerebellum, sensory pathways and the vestibular apparatus. 
      This condition is termed cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia 
      syndrome (CANVAS). Since the identification of this novel gene mutation, the 
      phenotypic spectrum of RFC1 mutations continues to expand and includes not only 
      CANVAS but also slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, ataxia with chronic cough 
      (ACC), isolated sensory neuropathy and multisystemic diseases. We present a 
      patient with a genetically confirmed intronic repeat expansion in the RFC1 gene 
      with a symptom complex not described previously.

TI  - RFC1 repeat expansions: A recurrent cause of sensory and autonomic neuropathy 
      with cough and ataxia.
PG  - 2156-2161
LID - 10.1111/ene.15310 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ataxia and cough are rare features in hereditary sensory 
      and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN), a group of diseases of mostly unknown genetic 
      cause. Biallelic repeat expansions in RFC1 are associated with cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). This study aimed to 
      investigate the prevalence of RFC1 repeat expansions in a cohort of HSAN 
      patients. METHODS: After unremarkable whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis, we 
      performed repeat-primed PCR to detect intronic RFC1 expansions in 12 HSAN 
      families, who all presented with chronic cough. RESULTS: In these patients, 75% 
      carried biallelic expansions of the pathogenic AAGGG motif. Compared with RFC1-/- 
      cases, RFC1+/+ cases presented more consistently with positive sensory and 
      autonomic symptoms. Afferent ataxia was more severe in the RFC1+/+ cohort and 
      cerebellar ataxia was a common feature (21%). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that 
      RFC1 is a frequent cause of (WES-negative) HSAN with chronic cough and ataxia. 
      The diagnostic yield of RFC1 repeat-primed PCR was surprisingly high, given that 
      HSAN is genetically poorly understood. This combination of HSAN, ataxia, and 
      chronic cough symptoms represents a new nosological entity within the 
      neuropathy-ataxia spectrum.

TI  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS): from 
      clinical diagnosis towards genetic testing.
PG  - 301-310
LID - 10.1515/medgen-2021-2098 [doi]
AB  - The cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a 
      late-onset and recessively inherited ataxia. For many years, CANVAS has been 
      diagnosed based on the clinical phenotype. Only recently, a large biallelic 
      pentanucleotide repeat expansion in the replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) 
      gene has been identified as the underlying genetic cause for the large majority 
      of CANVAS cases. Subsequently, other phenotypes such as ataxia with chronic 
      cough, incomplete CANVAS and MSA-C-like phenotypes have been associated with 
      biallelic RFC1 repeat expansions. Because of this heterogeneity it has been 
      suggested to change the name of the disease to "RFC1 disease". Chronic cough is 
      characteristic and can precede neurological symptoms by years or decades. In the 
      neurological examination signs of cerebellar, sensory, and vestibular ataxia are 
      frequently observed. Nerve conduction studies usually show absent or markedly 
      reduced sensory nerve action potentials. On brain MRI cerebellar degeneration and 
      spinal cord alterations are common. In later disease stages more widespread 
      neurodegeneration with additional involvement of the brainstem and basal ganglia 
      is possible. As yet, the exact incidence of RFC1-associated neurological diseases 
      remains uncertain although first studies suggest that RFC1-related ataxia is 
      common. Moreover, the pathophysiological mechanisms caused by the large biallelic 
      pentanucleotide repeat expansions in RFC1 remain elusive. Future molecular and 
      genetic research as well as natural history studies are highly desirable to pave 
      the way towards personalized treatment approaches.

AB  - An intronic expansion (AAGGG)(exp) in the RFC1 gene has recently been shown to 
      cause recessively inherited cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular 
      areflexia syndrome and, furthermore, a few patients with ataxia and parkinsonism 
      have been reported. We investigated 569 Finnish patients with medicated 
      parkinsonism for RFC1 and found biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) in three 
      non-consanguineous patients with clinically confirmed Parkinson's disease without 
      ataxia suggesting that RFC1-related disorders include Parkinson's disease as 
      well.

TI  - Motor neuron pathology in CANVAS due to RFC1 expansions.
PG  - 2121-2132
LID - 10.1093/brain/awab449 [doi]
AB  - CANVAS caused by RFC1 biallelic expansions is a major cause of inherited sensory 
      neuronopathy. Detection of RFC1 expansion is challenging and CANVAS can be 
      associated with atypical features. We clinically and genetically characterized 50 
      patients, selected based on the presence of sensory neuronopathy confirmed by 
      EMG. We screened RFC1 expansion by PCR, repeat-primed PCR, and Southern blotting 
      of long-range PCR products, a newly developed method. Neuropathological 
      characterization was performed on the brain and spinal cord of one patient. Most 
      patients (88%) carried a biallelic (AAGGG)n expansion in RFC1. In addition to the 
      core CANVAS phenotype (sensory neuronopathy, cerebellar syndrome and vestibular 
      impairment), we observed chronic cough (97%), oculomotor signs (85%), motor 
      neuron involvement (55%), dysautonomia (50%), and parkinsonism (10%). Motor 
      neuron involvement was found for 24 of 38 patients (63.1%). First motor neuron 
      signs, such as brisk reflexes, extensor plantar responses, and/or spasticity, 
      were present in 29% of patients, second motor neuron signs, such as 
      fasciculations, wasting, weakness, or a neurogenic pattern on EMG in 18%, and 
      both in 16%. Mixed motor and sensory neuronopathy was observed in 19% of 
      patients. Among six non-RFC1 patients, one carried a heterozygous AAGGG expansion 
      and a pathogenic variant in GRM1. Neuropathological examination of one RFC1 
      patient with an enriched phenotype, including parkinsonism, dysautonomia, and 
      cognitive decline, showed posterior column and lumbar posterior root atrophy. 
      Degeneration of the vestibulospinal and spinocerebellar tracts was mild. We 
      observed marked astrocytic gliosis and axonal swelling of the synapse between 
      first and second motor neurons in the anterior horn at the lumbar level. The 
      cerebellum showed mild depletion of Purkinje cells, with empty baskets, 
      torpedoes, and astrogliosis characterized by a disorganization of the Bergmann's 
      radial glia. We found neuronal loss in the vagal nucleus. The pars compacta of 
      the substantia nigra was depleted, with widespread Lewy bodies in the locus 
      coeruleus, substantia nigra, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala. We 
      propose new guidelines for the screening of RFC1 expansion, considering different 
      expansion motifs. Here, we developed a new method to more easily detect 
      pathogenic RFC1 expansions. We report frequent motor neuron involvement and 
      different neuronopathy subtypes. Parkinsonism was more prevalent in this cohort 
      than in the general population, 10% versus the expected 1% (P < 0.001). We 
      describe, for the first time, the spinal cord pathology in CANVAS, showing the 
      alteration of posterior columns and roots, astrocytic gliosis and axonal 
      swelling, suggesting motor neuron synaptic dysfunction.

LID - 382
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetics of cerebellar ataxia is complex. Hundreds of causative 
      genes have been identified, but only a few cause more than single cases. The 
      spectrum of ataxia-causing genes differs considerably between populations. The 
      aim of the study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of ataxia in the 
      Finnish population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients in hospital database were 
      reviewed for the diagnosis of unspecified ataxia. Acquired ataxias and nongenetic 
      ataxias such as those related to infection, trauma or stroke were excluded. Sixty 
      patients with sporadic ataxia with unknown etiology and 36 patients with familial 
      ataxia of unknown etiology were recruited in the study. Repeat expansions in the 
      SCA genes (ATXN1, 2, 3, 7, 8/OS, CACNA1A, TBP), FXN, and RFC1 were determined. 
      Point mutations in POLG, SPG7 and in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were investigated. 
      In addition, DNA from 8 patients was exome sequenced. RESULTS: A genetic cause of 
      ataxia was found in 33 patients (34.4%). Seven patients had a dominantly 
      inherited repeat expansion in ATXN8/OS. Ten patients had mitochondrial ataxia 
      resulting from mutations in nuclear mitochondrial genes POLG or RARS2, or from a 
      point mutation m.8561C > G or a single deletion in mtDNA. Interestingly, five 
      patients were biallelic for the recently identified pathogenic repeat expansion 
      in RFC1. All the five patients presented with the phenotype of cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia (CANVAS). Moreover, screening of 54 patients 
      with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy revealed four additional patients with 
      biallelic repeat expansion in RFC1, but none of them had cerebellar symptoms. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Expansion in ATXN8/OS results in the majority of dominant ataxias in 
      Finland, while mutations in RFC1 and POLG are the most common cause of recessive 
      ataxias. Our results suggest that analysis of RFC1 should be included in the 
      routine diagnostics of idiopathic ataxia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth polyneuropathy.

AB  - A homozygous AAGGG repeat expansion within the RFC1 gene was recently described 
      as a common cause of CANVAS syndrome. We examined 1069 sporadic ALS patients for 
      the presence of this repeat expansion. We did not discover any carriers of the 
      homozygous AAGGG expansion in our ALS cohort, indicating that this form of RFC1 
      repeat expansions is not a common cause of sporadic ALS. However, our study did 
      identify a novel repeat conformation and further expanded on the highly 
      polymorphic nature of the RFC1 locus.

      important cause of late-onset ataxia with unique clinical features.
PG  - 939-945
LID - 10.1007/s13760-021-01721-2 [doi]
AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a 
      late-onset, slowly progressive disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, 
      sensory neuropathy and bilateral vestibulopathy. Recently, a biallelic intronic 
      AAGGG repeat expansion, (AAGGG)(exp), in the Replication Factor C1 (RFC1) gene 
      was identified as the cause of this disorder. In this study, we describe the 
      phenotypic features of five patients from five different families diagnosed as 
      CANVAS. The mean age at onset was 49.00 +/- 9.05 years (between 34 and 56 years) 
      and the most frequent presenting symptom in CANVAS was gait ataxia, followed by 
      sensory disturbances. Persistent coughing was prominent in three patients, and it 
      preceded the onset of ataxia and sensory symptoms in two patients. Parental 
      consanguinity was present in three patients. Two patients showed symptoms or 
      signs suggesting autonomic involvement. Sural nerve biopsy revealed axonal 
      neuropathy in two patients. The mean age at onset was 49.00 +/- 9.05 years (between 
      34 and 56 years) and the most frequent presenting symptom in CANVAS was gait 
      ataxia, followed by sensory disturbances. Persistent coughing was prominent in 
      three patients, and it preceded the onset of ataxia and sensory symptoms in two 
      patients. Parental consanguinity was present in three patients. Two patients 
      showed symptoms or signs suggesting autonomic involvement. Sural nerve biopsy 
      revealed axonal neuropathy in two patients. Our study describes clinical 
      findings, histopathological features and diagnostic clues of CANVAS from Turkey, 
      a country with a high consanguineous marriage rate. Repeat expansion in the RFC1 
      gene should be considered in all cases with late-onset ataxia, especially when 
      sensory disturbances, vestibular involvement and persistent coughing coexist.

TI  - RFC1 expansions are a common cause of idiopathic sensory neuropathy.
PG  - 1542-1550
LID - 10.1093/brain/awab072 [doi]
AB  - After extensive evaluation, one-third of patients affected by polyneuropathy 
      remain undiagnosed and are labelled as having chronic idiopathic axonal 
      polyneuropathy, which refers to a sensory or sensory-motor, axonal, slowly 
      progressive neuropathy of unknown origin. Since a sensory neuropathy/neuronopathy 
      is identified in all patients with genetically confirmed RFC1 cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome, we speculated that RFC1 expansions 
      could underlie a fraction of idiopathic sensory neuropathies also diagnosed as 
      chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy. We retrospectively identified 225 
      patients diagnosed with chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (125 sensory 
      neuropathy, 100 sensory-motor neuropathy) from our general neuropathy clinics in 
      Italy and the UK. All patients underwent full neurological evaluation and a blood 
      sample was collected for RFC1 testing. Biallelic RFC1 expansions were identified 
      in 43 patients (34%) with sensory neuropathy and in none with sensory-motor 
      neuropathy. Forty-two per cent of RFC1-positive patients had isolated sensory 
      neuropathy or sensory neuropathy with chronic cough, while vestibular and/or 
      cerebellar involvement, often subclinical, were identified at examination in 58%. 
      Although the sensory ganglia are the primary pathological target of the disease, 
      the sensory impairment was typically worse distally and symmetric, while gait and 
      limb ataxia were absent in two-thirds of the cases. Sensory amplitudes were 
      either globally absent (26%) or reduced in a length-dependent (30%) or non-length 
      dependent pattern (44%). A quarter of RFC1-positive patients had previously 
      received an alternative diagnosis, including Sjogren's syndrome, sensory chronic 
      inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and paraneoplastic neuropathy, while 
      three cases had been treated with immune therapies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The biallelic inheritance of an expanded intronic pentamer 
      (AAGGG)(exp) in the gene encoding replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) has been 
      found to be a cause of cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia 
      syndrome (CANVAS). This study describes clinical and genetic features of our 
      patients with clinical suspicion of the syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective 
      descriptive study from an ataxia database comprising 500 patients. SETTING: The 
      study was performed at the Otorhinolaryngology Department of a hospital in the 
      north of Spain. METHODS: Specific genetic testing for CANVAS was performed in 13 
      patients with clinical suspicion of complete or incomplete syndrome. The clinical 
      diagnosis was supported by quantitative vestibular hypofunction, cerebellar 
      atrophy, and abnormal sensory nerve conduction testing. RESULTS: Nine of 13 (69%) 
      patients met clinical diagnostic criteria for definite CANVAS disease. The first 
      manifestation of the syndrome was lower limb dysesthesia in 8 of 13 patients and 
      gait imbalance in 5 of 13. Eleven of 13 (85%) patients were carriers of the 
      biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) in RFC1. CONCLUSION: A genetic cause of CANVAS has 
      recently been discovered. We propose genetic screening for biallelic expansions 
      of the AAGGG pentamer of RFC1 in all patients with clinical suspicion of CANVAS, 
      since accurate early diagnosis could improve the quality of life of these 
      patients.

TI  - RFC1 AAGGG repeat expansion masquerading as Chronic Idiopathic Axonal 
      Polyneuropathy.
PG  - 4280-4290
LID - 10.1007/s00415-021-10552-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A biallelic intronic AAGGG repeat expansion in the Replication Factor 
      C subunit 1 (RFC1) gene has been recently associated with Cerebellar Ataxia, 
      Neuropathy, Vestibular Areflexia Syndrome, a disorder often presenting as a 
      slowly evolving sensory neuropathy at the onset. "Chronic Idiopathic Axonal 
      Polyneuropathy" (CIAP) is a common indolent axonal neuropathy of adulthood which 
      remains without an identifiable cause despite thorough investigations. METHODS: 
      We screened 234 probands diagnosed with CIAP for a pathogenic biallelic RFC1 
      AAGGG repeat expansion. Patients were selected from 594 consecutive patients with 
      neuropathy referred to our tertiary-care center for a sural nerve biopsy over 
      10 years. RESULTS: The RFC1 AAGGG repeat expansion was common in patients with 
      pure sensory neuropathy (21/40, 53%) and less frequent in cases with 
      predominantly sensory (10/56, 18%, P < 0.001) or sensorimotor (3/138, 2%, 
      P < 0.001) neuropathy. The mutation was associated with sensory ataxia 
      (tau(b) = 0.254, P < 0.001), autonomic disturbances (35% vs 8%, Prevalence Odds 
      Ratio-POR 6.73 CI 95% 2.79-16.2, P < 0.001), retained deep tendon reflexes (score 
      18.0/24 vs 11.5/24, R = 0.275, P < 0.001). On pathology, we observed absent/scant 
      regenerative changes (tau(b) = - 0.362, P < 0.001), concomitant involvement of 
      large (100% and 99%, n.s.), small myelinated (97% vs 81%, POR 7.74 CI 95% 
      1.03-58.4, P = 0.02) and unmyelinated nerve fibers (85% vs 41%, POR 8.52 CI 95% 
      3.17-22.9, P < 0.001). Cerebellar or vestibular involvement was similarly rare in 
      the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the frequent occurrence of the 
      RFC1 AAGGG repeat expansion in patients diagnosed with CIAP and characterizes the 
      clinical and pathological features of the related neuro(no)pathy.

TI  - Whole-Genome Sequencing in Diagnostics of Selected Slovenian Undiagnosed Patients 
      with Rare Disorders.
LID - 10.3390/life11030205 [doi]
LID - 205
AB  - Several patients with rare genetic disorders remain undiagnosed following 
      comprehensive diagnostic testing using whole-exome sequencing (WES). In these 
      patients, pathogenic genetic variants may reside in intronic or regulatory 
      regions or they may emerge through mutational mechanisms not detected by WES. For 
      this reason, we implemented whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in routine clinical 
      diagnostics of patients with undiagnosed genetic disorders and report on the 
      outcome in 30 patients. Criteria for consideration included (1) negative WES, (2) 
      a high likelihood of a genetic cause for the disorders, (3) positive family 
      history, (4) detection of large blocks of homozygosity or (5) detection of a 
      single pathogenic variant in a gene associated with recessive conditions. We 
      successfully discovered a causative genetic variant in 6 cases, a 
      retrotranspositional event in the APC gene, non-coding variants in the intronic 
      region of the OTC gene and the promotor region of the UFM1 gene, repeat expansion 
      in the RFC1 gene and a single exon duplication in the CNGB3 gene. We also 
      discovered one coding variant, an indel, which was missed by variant caller 
      during WES data analysis. Our study demonstrates the impact of WGS in the group 
      of patients with undiagnosed genetic diseases after WES in the clinical setting 
      and the diversity of mutational mechanisms discovered, which would remain 
      undetected using other methods.

TI  - Biallelic RFC1 pentanucleotide repeat expansions in Greek patients with 
      late-onset ataxia.
PG  - 90-94
LID - 10.1111/cge.13960 [doi]
AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) has been 
      recently linked to biallelic expansions of a pentanucleotide repeat in the 
      replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) gene. Herein, we sought to investigate the 
      presence of pathological RFC1 expansions in selected Greek patients with 
      late-onset ataxia and delineate the phenotypic spectrum of genetically confirmed 
      CANVAS in the Greek population. We screened genetically a total of 77 selected 
      index patients, 67 originating from a cerebellar ataxia cohort and 10 from a 
      hereditary neuropathy cohort. We identified five index cases (6.5%) with 
      biallelic pathological RFC1 expansions, two in the cerebellar ataxia cohort (3%) 
      and three in the neuropathy cohort (30%). Overall, four out of five of cases with 
      full-blown CANVAS and one case with sensory ataxic neuropathy had biallelic 
      pathological expansions. The phenotypic spectrum of positive cases (including two 
      affected siblings) was consistent with previous reports and implied that the 
      sensory neuropathy may be the earliest feature in genetically confirmed CANVAS. 
      Screening for biallelic RFC1 expansions is recommended in all cases with 
      late-onset ataxia of unknown cause, particularly when a sensory neuropathy is 
      present.

TI  - Biallelic RFC1-expansion in a French multicentric sporadic ataxia cohort.
PG  - 3337-3343

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome 
      (CANVAS) is a recessively inherited multisystem ataxia compromising cerebellar, 
      vestibular, and sensory nerves, which has been associated to a pathogenic 
      AAGGG(n) biallelic expansion repeat in the RFC1 gene. Our objective was to assess 
      its prevalence in a French cohort of patients with idiopathic sporadic late-onset 
      ataxia (ILOA), idiopathic early-onset ataxia (IEOA), or Multiple System Atrophy 
      of Cerebellar type (MSA-C). METHODS: 163 patients were recruited in 3 French 
      tertiary centers: 100 ILOA, 21 IEOA, and 42 patients with possible or probable 
      MSA-C. RESULTS: A pathogenic biallelic RFC1 AAGGG(n) repeat expansion was found 
      in 15 patients: 15/100 in the ILOA group, but none in the IEOA and MSA-C 
      subgroups. 14/15 patients had a CANVAS phenotype. Only 1/15 had isolated 
      cerebellar ataxia, but also shorter biallelic expansions. Two RFC1 AAGGG(n) 
      alleles were found in 78% of patients with a CANVAS phenotype. In one post-mortem 
      case, the pathophysiological involvement of cerebellum and medullar posterior 
      columns was found. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the genetic heterogeneity of 
      the CANVAS and that RFC1 repeat expansions should be searched for preferentially 
      in case of unexplained ILOA associated with a sensory neuronopathy, but not 
      particularly in patients classified as MSA-C.

TI  - Natural History, Phenotypic Spectrum, and Discriminative Features of 
      Multisystemic RFC1 Disease.
PG  - e1369-e1382
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000011528 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To delineate the full phenotypic spectrum, discriminative features, 
      piloting longitudinal progression data, and sample size calculations of 
      replication factor complex subunit 1 (RFC1) repeat expansions, recently 
      identified as causing cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia 
      syndrome (CANVAS). METHODS: Multimodal RFC1 repeat screening (PCR, Southern blot, 
      whole-exome/genome sequencing-based approaches) combined with cross-sectional and 
      longitudinal deep phenotyping in (1) cross-European cohort A (70 families) with 
      >/=2 features of CANVAS or ataxia with chronic cough (ACC) and (2) Turkish cohort B 
      (105 families) with unselected late-onset ataxia. RESULTS: Prevalence of RFC1 
      disease was 67% in cohort A, 14% in unselected cohort B, 68% in clinical CANVAS, 
      and 100% in ACC. RFC1 disease was also identified in Western and Eastern Asian 
      individuals and even by whole-exome sequencing. Visual compensation, sensory 
      symptoms, and cough were strong positive discriminative predictors (>90%) against 
      RFC1-negative patients. The phenotype across 70 RFC1-positive patients was mostly 
      multisystemic (69%), including dysautonomia (62%) and bradykinesia (28%) (overlap 
      with cerebellar-type multiple system atrophy [MSA-C]), postural instability 
      (49%), slow vertical saccades (17%), and chorea or dystonia (11%). Ataxia 
      progression was  approximately 1.3 Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia points per 
      year (32 cross-sectional, 17 longitudinal assessments, follow-up </=9 years [mean 
      3.1 years]) but also included early falls, variable nonlinear phases of 
      MSA-C-like progression (SARA points 2.5-5.5 per year), and premature death. 
      Treatment trials require 330 (1-year trial) and 132 (2-year trial) patients in 
      total to detect 50% reduced progression. CONCLUSIONS: RFC1 disease is frequent 
      and occurs across continents, with CANVAS and ACC as highly diagnostic phenotypes 
      yet as variable, overlapping clusters along a continuous multisystemic disease 
      spectrum, including MSA-C-overlap. Our natural history data help to inform future 
      RFC1 treatment trials. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II 
      evidence that RFC1 repeat expansions are associated with CANVAS and ACC.

TI  - Spasmodic cough preceding CANVAS phenotype in a family with biallelic repeat 
      expansions in RFC1.
PG  - 749-753
LID - 10.1007/s10072-020-04895-4 [doi]
AB  - Cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a 
      late-onset, multisystem ataxia that remained only clinically defined, until 
      recently, when the discovery of biallelic repeat expansion in the RFC1 gene 
      allowed the genetic link. We describe the first Portuguese familial CANVAS 
      harboring the pathogenic RFC1 expansion. Detail clinical features and course of 
      four affected members are provided. Phenotype characterizations are important as 
      the novel RFC1 mutation is expected to be a major cause of idiopathic late-onset 
      ataxia.

TI  - A novel RFC1 repeat motif (ACAGG) in two Asia-Pacific CANVAS families.
PG  - 2904-2910
LID - 10.1093/brain/awaa263 [doi]
AB  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) is a 
      progressive late-onset, neurological disease. Recently, a pentanucleotide 
      expansion in intron 2 of RFC1 was identified as the genetic cause of CANVAS. We 
      screened an Asian-Pacific cohort for CANVAS and identified a novel RFC1 repeat 
      expansion motif, (ACAGG)exp, in three affected individuals. This motif was 
      associated with additional clinical features including fasciculations and 
      elevated serum creatine kinase. These features have not previously been described 
      in individuals with genetically-confirmed CANVAS. Haplotype analysis showed our 
      patients shared the same core haplotype as previously published, supporting the 
      possibility of a single origin of the RFC1 disease allele. We analysed data from 
      >26 000 genetically diverse individuals in gnomAD to show enrichment of (ACAGG) 
      in non-European populations.

TI  - Biallelic Intronic AAGGG Expansion of RFC1 is Related to Multiple System Atrophy.
PG  - 1132-1143
LID - 10.1002/ana.25902 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A recessive biallelic repeat expansion, (AAGGG)(exp) , in the RFC1 
      gene has been reported to be a frequent cause of late-onset ataxia. For 
      cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), the 
      recessive biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) genotype was present in ~92% of cases. This 
      study aimed to examine whether the pentanucleotide repeat (PNR) was related to 
      multiple system atrophy (MSA), which shares a spectrum of symptoms with CANVAS. 
      METHODS: In this study, we screened the pathogenic (AAGGG)(exp) repeat and 5 
      other PNRs in 104 Chinese sporadic adult-onset ataxia of unknown aetiology (SAOA) 
      patients, 282 MSA patients, and 203 unaffected individuals. Multiple molecular 
      genetic tests were used, including long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 
      repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR), Sanger sequencing, and Southern blot. Comprehensive 
      clinical assessments were conducted, including neurological examination, 
      neuroimaging, nerve electrophysiology, and examination of vestibular function. 
      RESULTS: We identified biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) in 1 SAOA patient and 3 MSA 
      patients. Additionally, 1 MSA patient had the (AAGGG)(exp) /(AAAGG)(exp) genotype 
      with uncertain pathogenicity. We also described the carrier frequency for 
      different PNRs in our cohorts. Furthermore, we summarized the distinct phenotypes 
      of affected patients, suggesting that biallelic (AAGGG)(exp) in RFC1 could be 
      associated with MSA and should be screened routinely in the MSA diagnostic 
      workflow. INTERPRETATION: Our results expanded the clinical phenotypic spectrum 
      of RFC1-related disorders and raised the possibility that MSA might share the 
      same genetic background as CANVAS, which is crucial for re-evaluating the current 
      CANVAS and MSA diagnostic criteria. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:1132-1143.

PG  - 1119-1126
LID - 10.1007/s00415-020-10183-0 [doi]
AB  - The ataxias are a group of disorders that manifest with balance, movement, speech 
      and visual problems. They can arise due to dysfunction of the cerebellum, the 
      vestibular system and/or the sensory neurons. Genetic defects are a common cause 
      of chronic ataxia, particularly common are repeat expansions in this group of 
      conditions. Co-occurrence of cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular 
      areflexia syndrome has been termed CANVAS. Although CANVAS is a rare syndrome, on 
      discovery of biallelic expansions in the second intron of replication factor C 
      subunit 1 (RFC1) gene, we and others have found the phenotype is broad and RFC1 
      expansions are a common cause of late-onset progressive ataxia.We aim to provide 
      a review and update on recent developments in CANVAS and populations, where the 
      disorder has been reported. We have also optimised a protocol for RFC1 expansion 
      screening which is described herein and expanded phenotype after analysing 
      late-onset ataxia patients from around the world.

TI  - Clinical spectrum of the pentanucleotide repeat expansion in the RFC1 gene in 
      ataxia syndromes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical significance of an intronic biallelic 
      pentanucleotide repeat expansion in the gene encoding replication factor C 
      subunit 1 (RFC1) in patients with late-onset cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), in patients with other ataxias, and in 
      healthy controls by comprehensive genetic analyses. METHODS: In this case-control 
      study, we included 457 individuals comprising 26 patients with complete or 
      incomplete CANVAS, 70 patients with late-onset cerebellar ataxia, 208 healthy 
      controls, and 153 individuals from 39 multigenerational families without ataxia 
      to determine repeat stability. All 96 patients were screened for the repeat 
      expansion by duplex PCR. To further characterize the repeat type and lengths, we 
      used fragment length analysis, repeat-primed PCR, Sanger sequencing, and Southern 
      blotting. Expression of RFC1 and the neighboring gene WDR19 were determined by 
      quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Massive biallelic pentanucleotide expansions were 
      found in 15/17 patients with complete CANVAS (88%), in 2/9 patients with 
      incomplete CANVAS (22%), in 4/70 patients with unspecified, late-onset cerebellar 
      ataxia (6%), but not in controls. In patients, the expansion comprised 800-1,000 
      mostly AAGGG repeats. Nonmassively expanded repeat numbers were in the range of 
      7-137 repeats and relatively stable during transmission. Expression of RFC1 and 
      WDR19 were unchanged and RFC1 intron retention was not found. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      biallelic pentanucleotide repeat expansion is a frequent cause of CANVAS and 
      found in a considerable number of patients with an incomplete clinical 
      presentation or other forms of cerebellar ataxia. The mechanism by which the 
      repeat expansions are causing disease remains unclear and warrants further 
      investigations.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia syndrome 
      (CANVAS) is a recently recognized neurodegenerative disease with onset in mid- to 
      late adulthood. The genetic basis for a large proportion of Caucasian patients 
      was recently shown to be the biallelic expansion of a pentanucleotide (AAGGG)n 
      repeat in RFC1. Here, we describe the first instance of CANVAS genetic testing in 
      New Zealand Maori and Cook Island Maori individuals. We show a novel, possibly 
      population-specific CANVAS configuration (AAAGG)10-25(AAGGG)exp, which was the 
      cause of CANVAS in all patients. There were no apparent phenotypic differences 
      compared with European CANVAS patients. Presence of a common disease haplotype 
      among this cohort suggests this novel repeat expansion configuration is a founder 
      effect in this population, which may indicate that CANVAS will be especially 
      prevalent in this group. Haplotype dating estimated the most recent common 
      ancestor at  approximately 1430 ce. We also show the same core haplotype as previously 
      described, supporting a single origin of the CANVAS mutation.

TI  - RFC1 repeat expansion in Japanese patients with late-onset cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 1143-1147
LID - 10.1038/s10038-020-0807-x [doi]
AB  - Recently, the expansion of an intronic AAGGG repeat in the replication factor C 
      subunit 1 (RFC1) gene was reported to cause cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). In Europeans, the expansion accounted for 
      22% of sporadic patients with late-onset ataxia. We genotyped 37 Japanese 
      patients comprising 25 familial (autosomal recessive or undecided transmission) 
      and 12 sporadic ones with late-onset ataxia. We found intronic repeat expansions 
      in RFC1 in three (12%) of the familial patients and one (8.5%) of the sporadic 
      ones. Although our cohort study was small, the disease frequency in Japanese 
      patients with CANVAS might be lower than that in European ones. In addition, we 
      found biallelic ACAGG repeat expansion in one patient, indicating ACAGG repeat 
      expansion might cause CANVAS. Clinically, we found one patient with sleep apnea 
      syndrome, which has not been reported previously. Thus, this study might expand 
      the clinical and genetic spectrum of CANVAS.

TI  - Prevalence of RFC1-mediated spinocerebellar ataxia in a North American ataxia

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the prevalence of pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) and disabled adaptor protein 1 (DAB1) in an 
      undiagnosed ataxia cohort from North America. METHODS: A cohort of 596 
      predominantly adult-onset patients with undiagnosed familial or sporadic 
      cerebellar ataxia was evaluated at a tertiary referral ataxia center and excluded 
      for common genetic causes of cerebellar ataxia. Patients were then screened for 
      the presence of pathogenic repeat expansions in RFC1 (AAGGG) and DAB1 (ATTTC) 
      using fluorescent repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). Two additional undiagnosed ataxia 
      cohorts from different centers, totaling 302 and 13 patients, respectively, were 
      subsequently screened for RFC1, resulting in a combined 911 subjects tested. 
      RESULTS: In the initial cohort, 41 samples were identified with 1 expanded allele 
      in the RFC1 gene (6.9%), and 9 had 2 expanded alleles (1.5%). For the additional 
      cohorts, we found 20 heterozygous samples (6.6%) and 17 biallelic samples (5.6%) 
      in the larger cohort and 1 heterozygous sample (7.7%) and 3 biallelic samples 
      (23%) in the second. In total, 29 patients were identified with biallelic repeat 
      expansions in RFC1 (3.2%). Of these 29 patients, 8 (28%) had a clinical diagnosis 
      of cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), 14 
      had cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy (48%), 4 had pure cerebellar ataxia (14%), 
      and 3 had spinocerebellar ataxia (10%). No patients were identified with 
      expansions in the DAB1 gene (spinocerebellar ataxia type 37). CONCLUSIONS: In a 
      large undiagnosed ataxia cohort from North America, biallelic pathogenic repeat 
      expansion in RFC1 was observed in 3.2%. Testing should be strongly considered in 
      patients with ataxia, especially those with CANVAS or neuropathy.

AB  - We screened the RFC1 intronic AAGGG repeat expansions in late-onset ataxia cases, 
      MSA patients and controls. The data suggested that no biallelic repeat expansion 
      carrier was found in our cohort and the heterozygous intronic AAGGG repeat 
      expansions may not lead to an increased risk of late-onset ataxia or MSA.

TI  - Long-read sequencing identifies the pathogenic nucleotide repeat expansion in 
      RFC1 in a Japanese case of CANVAS.
PG  - 475-480
LID - 10.1038/s10038-020-0733-y [doi]
AB  - Recently, a recessively inherited intronic repeat expansion in replication factor 
      C1 (RFC1) was identified in cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). Here, we describe a Japanese case of 
      genetically confirmed CANVAS with autonomic failure and auditory hallucination. 
      The case showed impaired uptake of iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine and 
      (123)I-ioflupane in the cardiac sympathetic nerve and dopaminergic neurons, 
      respectively, by single-photon emission computed tomography. Long-read sequencing 
      identified biallelic pathogenic (AAGGG)n nucleotide repeat expansion in RFC1 and 
      heterozygous benign (TAAAA)n and (TAGAA)n expansions in brain expressed, 
      associated with NEDD4 (BEAN1). Enrichment of the repeat regions in RFC1 and BEAN1 
      using a Cas9-mediated system clearly distinguished between pathogenic and benign 
      repeat expansions. The haplotype around RFC1 indicated that the (AAGGG)n 
      expansion in our case was on the same ancestral allele as that of European cases. 
      Thus, long-read sequencing facilitates precise genetic diagnosis of diseases with 
      complex repeat structures and various expansions.

TI  - Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome due to RFC1 repeat 
      expansion.
PG  - 480-490
LID - 10.1093/brain/awz418 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia, causing imbalance, dizziness and falls, is a leading cause of 
      neurological disability. We have recently identified a biallelic intronic AAGGG 
      repeat expansion in replication factor complex subunit 1 (RFC1) as the cause of 
      cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) and a major 
      cause of late onset ataxia. Here we describe the full spectrum of the disease 
      phenotype in our first 100 genetically confirmed carriers of biallelic repeat 
      expansions in RFC1 and identify the sensory neuropathy as a common feature in all 
      cases to date. All patients were Caucasian and half were sporadic. Patients 
      typically reported progressive unsteadiness starting in the sixth decade. A dry 
      spasmodic cough was also frequently associated and often preceded by decades the 
      onset of walking difficulty. Sensory symptoms, oscillopsia, dysautonomia and 
      dysarthria were also variably associated. The disease seems to follow a pattern 
      of spatial progression from the early involvement of sensory neurons, to the 
      later appearance of vestibular and cerebellar dysfunction. Half of the patients 
      needed walking aids after 10 years of disease duration and a quarter were 
      wheelchair dependent after 15 years. Overall, two-thirds of cases had full 
      CANVAS. Sensory neuropathy was the only manifestation in 15 patients. Sixteen 
      patients additionally showed cerebellar involvement, and six showed vestibular 
      involvement. The disease is very likely to be underdiagnosed. Repeat expansion in 
      RFC1 should be considered in all cases of sensory ataxic neuropathy, 
      particularly, but not only, if cerebellar dysfunction, vestibular involvement and 
      cough coexist.

      Cohort: Identification of Novel Conformations.

LID - 1219
AB  - A biallelic pentanucleotide expansion in the RFC1 gene has been reported to be a 
      common cause of late-onset ataxia. In the general population, four different 
      repeat conformations are observed: wild type sequence AAAAG (11 repeats) and 
      longer expansions of either AAAAG, AAAGG or AAGGG sequences. However only the 
      biallelic AAGGG expansions were reported to cause late-onset ataxia. In this 
      study, we aimed to assess the prevalence and nature of RFC1 repeat expansions in 
      three cohorts of adult-onset ataxia cases: Brazilian (n = 23) and Canadian (n = 
      26) cases that are negative for the presence of variants in other known 
      ataxia-associated genes, as well as a cohort of randomly selected Canadian cases 
      (n = 128) without regard to a genetic diagnosis. We identified the biallelic 
      AAGGG expansion in only one Brazilian family which presented two affected 
      siblings, and in one Canadian case. We also observed two new repeat 
      conformations, AAGAG and AGAGG, which suggests the pentanucleotide expansion 
      sequence has a dynamic nature. To assess the frequency of these new repeat 
      conformations in the general population, we screened 163 healthy individuals and 
      observed the AAGAG expansion to be more frequent in cases than in control 
      individuals. While additional studies will be necessary to asses the pathogenic 
      impact of biallelic genotypes that include the novel expanded conformations, 
      their occurrence should nonetheless be examined in future studies.

TI  - Plasma Homocysteine and Polymorphisms of Genes Involved in Folate Metabolism 
      Correlate with DNMT1 Gene Methylation Levels.
LID - 10.3390/metabo9120298 [doi]
LID - 298
AB  - DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is responsible for the maintenance of DNA 
      methylation patterns during cell division. Several human diseases are 
      characterized by impaired DNMT1 gene methylation, but less is known about the 
      factors that regulate DNMT1 promoter methylation levels. Dietary folates and 
      related B-vitamins are essential micronutrients for DNA methylation processes, 
      and we performed the present study to investigate the contribution of circulating 
      folate, vitamin B12, homocysteine, and common polymorphisms in folate pathway 
      genes to the DNMT1 gene methylation levels. We investigated DNMT1 gene 
      methylation levels in peripheral blood DNA samples from 215 healthy individuals. 
      All the DNA samples were genotyped for MTHFR 677C > T (rs1801133) and 1298A > C 
      (rs1801131), MTRR 66A > G (rs1801394), MTR 2756A > G (rs1805087), SLC19A1 (RFC1) 
      80G > A (rs1051266), TYMS 28-bp tandem repeats (rs34743033) and 1494 6-bp 
      insertion/deletion (indel) (rs34489327), DNMT3A -448A > G (rs1550117), and DNMT3B 
      -149C > T (rs2424913) polymorphisms. Circulating homocysteine, folate, and 
      vitamin B12 levels were available from 158 of the recruited individuals. We 
      observed an inverse correlation between plasma homocysteine and DNMT1 methylation 
      levels. Furthermore, both MTR rs1805087 and TYMS rs34743033 polymorphisms showed 
      a statistically significant effect on DNMT1 methylation levels. The present study 
      revealed several correlations between the folate metabolic pathway and DNMT1 
      promoter methylation that could be of relevance for those disorders characterized 
      by altered DNA methylation.

TI  - Association of Polymorphisms in Genes Involved in One-Carbon Metabolism with 
      MTHFR Methylation Levels.
LID - 10.3390/ijms20153754 [doi]
LID - 3754
AB  - Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a pivotal enzyme in the one-carbon 
      metabolism, a metabolic pathway required for DNA synthesis and methylation 
      reactions. MTHFR hypermethylation, resulting in reduced gene expression, can 
      contribute to several human disorders, but little is still known about the 
      factors that regulate MTHFR methylation levels. We performed the present study to 
      investigate if common polymorphisms in one-carbon metabolism genes contribute to 
      MTHFR methylation levels. MTHFR methylation was assessed in peripheral blood DNA 
      samples from 206 healthy subjects with methylation-sensitive high-resolution 
      melting (MS-HRM); genotyping was performed for MTHFR 677C>T (rs1801133) and 
      1298A>C (rs1801131), MTRR 66A>G (rs1801394), MTR 2756A>G (rs1805087), SLC19A1 
      (RFC1) 80G>A (rs1051266), TYMS 28-bp tandem repeats (rs34743033) and 1494 6-bp 
      ins/del (rs34489327), DNMT3A -448A>G (rs1550117), and DNMT3B -149C>T (rs2424913) 
      polymorphisms. We observed a statistically significant effect of the DNMT3B 
      -149C>T polymorphism on mean MTHFR methylation levels, and particularly CT and TT 
      carriers showed increased methylation levels than CC carriers. The present study 
      revealed an association between a functional polymorphism of DNMT3B and MTHFR 
      methylation levels that could be of relevance in those disorders, such as inborn 
      defects, metabolic disorders and cancer, that have been linked to impaired DNA 
      methylation.

AB  - Genomic technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) are revolutionizing 
      molecular diagnostics and clinical medicine. However, these approaches have 
      proven inefficient at identifying pathogenic repeat expansions. Here, we apply a 
      collection of bioinformatics tools that can be utilized to identify either known 
      or novel expanded repeat sequences in NGS data. We performed genetic studies of a 
      cohort of 35 individuals from 22 families with a clinical diagnosis of cerebellar 
      ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). 
      Analysis of whole-genome sequence (WGS) data with five independent algorithms 
      identified a recessively inherited intronic repeat expansion [(AAGGG)(exp)] in 
      the gene encoding Replication Factor C1 (RFC1). This motif, not reported in the 
      reference sequence, localized to an Alu element and replaced the reference 
      (AAAAG)(11) short tandem repeat. Genetic analyses confirmed the pathogenic 
      expansion in 18 of 22 CANVAS-affected families and identified a core ancestral 
      haplotype, estimated to have arisen in Europe more than twenty-five thousand 
      years ago. WGS of the four RFC1-negative CANVAS-affected families identified 
      plausible variants in three, with genomic re-diagnosis of SCA3, spastic ataxia of 
      the Charlevoix-Saguenay type, and SCA45. This study identified the genetic basis 
      of CANVAS and demonstrated that these improved bioinformatics tools increase the 
      diagnostic utility of WGS to determine the genetic basis of a heterogeneous group 
      of clinically overlapping neurogenetic disorders.

TI  - Biallelic expansion of an intronic repeat in RFC1 is a common cause of late-onset 
      ataxia.
PG  - 649-658
LID - 10.1038/s41588-019-0372-4 [doi]
AB  - Late-onset ataxia is common, often idiopathic, and can result from cerebellar, 
      proprioceptive, or vestibular impairment; when in combination, it is also termed 
      cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). We used 
      non-parametric linkage analysis and genome sequencing to identify a biallelic 
      intronic AAGGG repeat expansion in the replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) gene 
      as the cause of familial CANVAS and a frequent cause of late-onset ataxia, 
      particularly if sensory neuronopathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia coexist. 
      The expansion, which occurs in the poly(A) tail of an AluSx3 element and differs 
      in both size and nucleotide sequence from the reference (AAAAG)(11) allele, does 
      not affect RFC1 expression in patient peripheral and brain tissue, suggesting no 
      overt loss of function. These data, along with an expansion carrier frequency of 
      0.7% in Europeans, implies that biallelic AAGGG expansion in RFC1 is a frequent 
      cause of late-onset ataxia.

AB  - Putatively functional polymorphisms of one-carbon and xenobiotic metabolic 
      pathways influence susceptibility for wide spectrum of diseases. The current 
      study was aimed to explore gene-gene interactions among these two metabolic 
      pathways in four diseases i.e. breast cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 
      coronary artery disease (CAD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Multifactor 
      dimensionality reduction analysis was carried out on four case-control datasets. 
      Cross-talk was observed between one-carbon and xenobiotic pathways in breast 
      cancer (RFC 80 G>A, COMT H108L and TYMS 5'-UTR 28 bp tandem repeat) and SLE 
      (CYP1A1 m1, MTRR 66 A>G and GSTT1). Gene-gene interactions within one-carbon 
      metabolic pathway were observed in CAD (GCPII 1561 C>T, SHMT 1420 C>T and MTHFR 
      677 C>T) and PD (cSHMT 1420 C>T, MTRR 66 A>G and RFC1 80 G>A). These interaction 
      models showed good predictability of risk for PD (The area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (C) = 0.83) and SLE (C = 0.73); and moderate 
      predictability of risk for breast cancer (C = 0.64) and CAD (C = 0.63). 
      Cross-talk between one-carbon and xenobiotic pathways was observed in diseases 
      with female preponderance. Gene-gene interactions within one-carbon metabolic 
      pathway were observed in diseases with male preponderance.

TI  - Genetic polymorphisms in candidate genes predict increased toxicity with 
      methotrexate therapy in Lebanese children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
PG  - 387-96
LID - 10.1097/FPC.0000000000000069 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to analyze polymorphisms in genes involved 
      in 6-mercaptopurine detoxification (TPMT); methotrexate (MTX) metabolism 
      including ABCB1 (or MDR1), ABCC2, SLC19A1 (or RFC1), and SLCO1B1; and the MTX 
      effect mainly MTHFR and TYMS, and to assess whether these polymorphisms are 
      predictors of treatment toxicity and/or MTX clearance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      This study included 127 Lebanese acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, of whom 
      117 were treated following the St Jude's Children Research Hospital protocol. 
      Genotyping was performed using real-time PCR or restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism. MTX levels were measured using a polarization fluorescence assay 
      from Roche. MTX clearance was estimated on the basis of all available MTX levels 
      measured after high-dose MTX treatment during the consolidation phase. RESULTS: 
      Five variants in four genes (MTHFR, ABCB1, ABCC2, and TYMS) were shown to be 
      associated with toxicity, but neither was associated with MTX pharmacokinetic 
      parameters. For instance, during the consolidation phase, a statistically 
      significant association was found between MTHFR rs1801133 variant allele carriers 
      and a decrease in hemoglobin levels [odds ratio (OR)=3.057; 95% confidence 
      interval (CI): 1.217; 7.680]. In addition, a statistically significant 
      association was found among neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count<500) and 
      variant allele carriers of ABCB1 rs1045642 (OR=5.174; 95% CI: 1.674; 15.989) and 
      ABCB1 rs1128503 (OR=3.364; 95% CI: 1.257; 9.004), respectively. ABCC2 rs717620 
      variant allele carriers needed significantly more time to reach a MTX level below 
      0.1 micromol/l (beta=5.122; 95% CI: 1.412; 8.831). During the continuation phase, a 
      statistically significant association was found between ABCC2 rs717620 and TYMS 
      28-bp tandem repeats carriers with the need to decrease weekly MTX doses 
      (beta=-4.905; 95% CI: -9; -0.809 and beta=-5.770; 95% CI: -10.138; -1.403), 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Genotyping for MTHFR, ABCB1, ABCC2, and TYMS 
      polymorphisms may be useful in identifying patients at risk of increased MTX 
      toxicity and the need for dose optimization before treatment initiation.

AB  - This study from South India was performed to ascertain the impact of seven 
      functional polymorphisms of one-carbon metabolic pathway on total plasma 
      homocysteine levels and susceptibility to PD. A total of 151 cases of Parkinson's 
      disease and 416 healthy controls were analyzed for fasting plasma homocysteine 
      levels by reverse phase HPLC. PCR-RFLP approaches were used to analyze glutamate 
      carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) 1561 C>T, reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1) 80 G>A, 
      cytosolic serine hydroxymethyl transferase (cSHMT) 1420 C>T, methylene 
      tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677 C>T, methionine synthase (MTR) 2756 A>G 
      and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) 66 A>G polymorphisms. PCR-AFLP was used 
      for the analysis of thymidylate synthase (TYMS) 5'-UTR 28bp tandem repeat. PD 
      cases exhibited elevated plasma homocysteine levels compared to controls (men: 
      28.8 +/- 6.9 vs. 16.4 +/- 8.8 mumol/L; women: 25.4 +/- 5.3 vs. 11.2 +/- 5.1mumol/L). 
      Homocysteine levels showed positive correlation with male gender (r=0.39, 
      p<0.0001) and MTRR 66 A>G (r=0.31, p<0.0001) whereas an inverse correlation was 
      observed with cSHMT 1420 C>T polymorphism. MTRR 66 A>G polymorphism showed 
      independent risk for PD (OR: 3.42, 95% CI: 2.35-4.98) whereas cSHMT 1420 C>T 
      conferred protection against PD (OR: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.07-0.17). Multifactor 
      dimensionality reduction analysis showed synergistic interactions between MTHFR 
      677 C>T and MTRR 66 A>G, whereas cSHMT 1420 C>T exhibited counteracting 
      interactions in altering susceptibility to PD. To conclude, PD cases exhibited 
      hyperhomocysteinemia and MTRR 66 A>G and cSHMT 1420 C>T gene variants were shown 
      to modulate PD risk by altering the homocysteine levels.

AB  - We have earlier demonstrated the role of aberrant one-carbon metabolism in the 
      etiology of breast cancer. In the current study, we examine the clinical utility 
      of these factors in predicting the subtype of breast cancer and as indicators of 
      disease progression. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism (RFLP) and PCR-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) 
      approaches were used for genetic analysis. Plasma folate and homocysteine were 
      measured using Axsym folate kit and reverse phase HPLC, respectively. Multiple 
      linear regression models were used to test the predictability of disease 
      progression. Luminal A subtype was associated with late age of onset, higher body 
      mass index and lack of family history of breast cancer. Thymidylate synthase 
      (TYMS) 5'-UTR 28 bp tandem repeat (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.05-4.16) and methylene 
      tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T (OR: 4.10, 95% CI: 1.40-11.95) were 
      strongly associated with Luminal B. Reduced folate carrier (RFC1) G80A (OR: 2.92, 
      95% CI: 1.22-6.97) and methionine synthase (MTR) A2756G (OR: 4.71, 95% CI: 
      1.66-13.31) polymorphisms were associated with LuminA-HH subtype while MTHFR 
      C677T showed association with HER-enriched (OR: 30.41, 95% CI: 6.47-142.91). 
      Cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (cSHMT) conferred protection against 
      basal-like breast cancer (OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.22-0.98). HER-enriched and 
      basal-like subtypes showed positive association with familial breast cancer and 
      inverse association with plasma folate. Hyperhomocysteinemia was observed in 
      Luminal B and basal-like subtypes. Multiple linear regression models of aberrant 
      one-carbon metabolism were found to be moderate predictors of breast cancer grade 
      (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, C = 0.72, 95% CI: 
      0.58-0.87, P = 0.008). To conclude, aberrations in one-carbon metabolism predict 
      the subtype of breast cancer and disease progression.

TI  - Polyglutamation of methotrexate with common polymorphisms in reduced folate 
      carrier, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase, and 
      thymidylate synthase are associated with methotrexate effects in rheumatoid 
      arthritis.
PG  - 2766-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Methotrexate (MTX) enters cells through the reduced folate carrier 
      (RFC-1) and exerts part of its effects through polyglutamation to MTX 
      polyglutamates (MTXPGs) and inhibition of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 
      ribonucleotide transformylase (ATIC) and thymidylate synthase (TS). We 
      investigated the contribution of common genetic polymorphisms in RFC-1 (G80A), 
      ATIC (C347G), and TS (28-bp tandem repeats located in the TS enhancer region 
      [TSER*2/*3]) and of MTXPGs to the effect of MTX in patients with rheumatoid 
      arthritis. METHODS: The study was cross-sectional. All patients received MTX for 
      at least 3 months. The numbers of tender and swollen joints, the Visual Analog 
      Scale (VAS) scores for the physician's global assessment of disease activity, and 
      the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire scores were collected. Using the VAS 
      score for the physician's assessment of patient's response to MTX, the population 
      of patients was dichotomized into responders to MTX (VAS score < or =2 cm) and 
      nonresponders to MTX (VAS score >2 cm). A pharmacogenetic index was calculated as 
      the sum of homozygous variant genotypes (RFC-1 AA + ATIC 347GG + TSER *2/*2) 
      carried by the patients. MTXPG concentrations were measured in red blood cells 
      (RBCs) by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The dose of MTX was 
      not associated with the effects of MTX (P > 0.05). In contrast, increased RBC 
      long-chain MTXPG concentrations (median 40 nmoles/liter; range <5-131 
      nmoles/liter) and an increased pharmacogenetic index were associated with a lower 
      number of tender and swollen joints (P < 0.05) and a lower score for the 
      physician's global assessment of disease activity (P < or = 0.001). Patients with 
      RBC MTXPG levels of >60 nmoles/liter and carriers of a homozygous variant 
      genotype were 14.0-fold (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 3.6-53.8) and 3.7-fold 
      (95% CI 1.7-9.1), respectively, more likely to have a good response to MTX (P <or 
      = 0.01). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that measuring RBC MTXPG levels and/or 
      the common polymorphisms in the folate-purine-pyrimidine pathway may help in 
      monitoring MTX therapy.

TI  - Replication and expansion of trinucleotide repeats in yeast.
PG  - 1349-57
AB  - The mechanisms of trinucleotide repeat expansions, underlying more than a dozen 
      hereditary neurological disorders, are yet to be understood. Here we looked at 
      the replication of (CGG)(n) x (CCG)(n) and (CAG)(n) x (CTG)(n) repeats and their 
      propensity to expand in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using electrophoretic analysis 
      of replication intermediates, we found that (CGG)(n) x (CCG)(n) repeats 
      significantly attenuate replication fork progression. Replication inhibition for 
      this sequence becomes evident at as few as approximately 10 repeats and reaches a 
      maximal level at 30 to 40 repeats. This is the first direct demonstration of 
      replication attenuation by a triplet repeat in a eukaryotic system in vivo. For 
      (CAG)(n) x (CTG)(n) repeats, on the contrary, there is only a marginal 
      replication inhibition even at 80 repeats. The propensity of trinucleotide 
      repeats to expand was evaluated in a parallel genetic study. In wild-type cells, 
      expansions of (CGG)(25) x (CCG)(25) and (CAG)(25) x (CTG)(25) repeat tracts 
      occurred with similar low rates. A mutation in the large subunit of the 
      replicative replication factor C complex (rfc1-1) increased the expansion rate 
      for the (CGG)(25) repeat approximately 50-fold but had a much smaller effect on 
      the expansion of the (CTG)(25) repeat. These data show dramatic sequence-specific 
      expansion effects due to a mutation in the lagging strand DNA synthesis 
      machinery. Together, the results of this study suggest that expansions are likely 
      to result when the replication fork attempts to escape from the stall site.
