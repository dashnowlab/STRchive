TI  - Midface toddler excoriation syndrome (MiTES) can be caused by autosomal recessive 
      biallelic mutations in a gene for congenital insensitivity to pain, PRDM12.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Midface toddler excoriation syndrome (MiTES) is a condition recently 
      reported in three unrelated children. Habitual scratching from the first year of 
      life inflicted deep, chronic, scarring wounds around the nose and eyes. One child 
      had a mild neurological deficit but there was no other evidence of insensitivity 
      to pain. Bilateral distribution and localization to the midface distinguish MiTES 
      from other causes of self-inflicted skin damage such as trigeminal trophic 
      syndrome. An earlier study of five siblings from a consanguineous Irish family, 
      with lesions corresponding to MiTES plus other sensory deficits, showed 
      homozygous mutations in a gene for hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy 
      type VIII (HSAN8), PRDM12. OBJECTIVES: To study further cases of MiTES, including 
      analysis of PRDM12. METHODS: We describe five further children, from four 
      families, with facial lesions typical of MiTES, in whom mutation analysis of 
      PRDM12 was carried out. RESULTS: Homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic 
      expansions of the PRDM12 polyalanine tract were found in four of five affected 
      individuals, in three families. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of autosomal recessive 
      mutations in PRDM12 in four of five patients with MiTES extends the phenotypic 
      spectrum of PRDM12 mutations, which usually cause HSAN8, characterized by 
      mutilating self-inflicted wounds of the extremities, lips and tongue. By 
      contrast, MiTES shows severe midfacial lesions with little if any evidence of 
      generalized pain insensitivity. The condition is probably genetically 
      heterogeneous, and other congenital insensitivity to pain and HSAN genes such as 
      SCN11A may be implicated. This new understanding of the nature of MiTES, which 
      can masquerade as factitious disease, will facilitate appropriate management.
