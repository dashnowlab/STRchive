AB  - BACKGROUND: The causative genes for over 60% of inherited peripheral neuropathy 
      (IPN) remain unidentified. This study endeavours to enhance the genetic 
      diagnostic rate in IPN cases by conducting screenings focused on non-coding 
      repeat expansions. METHODS: We gathered data from 2424 unrelated Japanese 
      patients diagnosed with IPN, among whom 1555 cases with unidentified genetic 
      causes, as determined through comprehensive prescreening analyses, were selected 
      for the study. Screening for CGG non-coding repeat expansions in LRP12, GIPC1 and 
      RILPL1 genes was conducted using PCR and long-read sequencing technologies. 
      RESULTS: We identified CGG repeat expansions in LRP12 from 44 cases, establishing 
      it as the fourth most common aetiology in Japanese IPN. Most cases (29/37) 
      exhibited distal limb weakness, without ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, facial muscle 
      weakness or bulbar palsy. Neurogenic changes were frequently observed in both 
      needle electromyography (97%) and skeletal muscle tissue (100%). In nerve 
      conduction studies, 28 cases primarily showed impairment in motor nerves without 
      concurrent involvement of sensory nerves, consistent with the phenotype of 
      hereditary motor neuropathy. In seven cases, both motor and sensory nerves were 
      affected, resembling the Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) phenotype. Importantly, the 
      mean CGG repeat number detected in the present patients was significantly shorter 
      than that of patients with LRP12-oculopharyngodistal myopathy (p<0.0001). 
      Additionally, GIPC1 and RILPL1 repeat expansions were absent in our IPN cases. 
      CONCLUSION: We initially elucidate LRP12 repeat expansions as a prevalent cause 
      of CMT, highlighting the necessity for an adapted screening strategy in clinical 
      practice, particularly when addressing patients with IPN.

AB  - In patients of Asian ancestry, a heterozygous CGG repeat expansion of >100 units 
      in LRP12 is the cause of oculopharyngodistal myopathy type 1 (OPDM1). Repeat 
      lengths of between 61 and 100 units have been associated with rare amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases of Asian ancestry, although with unusually long 
      disease duration and without significant upper motor neuron involvement. This 
      study sought to determine whether LRP12 CGG repeat expansions were also present 
      in ALS patients of European ancestry. Whole-genome sequencing data from 608 
      sporadic ALS patients, 35 familial ALS probands, and 4703 neurologically normal 
      controls were screened for LRP12 CGG expansions using ExpansionHunter v4. All 
      individuals had LRP12 CGG repeat lengths within the normal range of 3-25 units. 
      To date, LRP12 CGG repeat expansions have not been reported in ALS patients of 
      European ancestry and may be limited to rare ALS patients of Asian ancestry and 
      atypical clinical presentations.

TI  - Non-coding CGG repeat expansion in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 is associated with a 
      phenotype of oculopharyngodistal myopathy.
PG  - 340-346
LID - 10.1136/jmg-2023-109345 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is a rare adult-onset 
      neuromuscular disease, associated with CGG repeat expansions in the 5' 
      untranslated region of LRP12, GIPC1, NOTCH2NLC and RILPL1. However, the genetic 
      cause of a proportion of pathoclinically confirmed cases remains unknown. 
      METHODS: A total of 26 OPDM patients with unknown genetic cause(s) from 4 
      tertiary referral hospitals were included in this study. Clinical data and 
      laboratory findings were collected. Muscle samples were observed by histological 
      and immunofluorescent staining. Long-read sequencing was initially conducted in 
      six patients with OPDM. Repeat-primed PCR was used to screen the CGG repeat 
      expansions in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 in all 26 patients. RESULTS: We identified CGG 
      repeat expansion in the non-coding transcripts of LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 in another 
      two unrelated Chinese cases with typical pathoclinical features of OPDM. The 
      repeat expansion was more than 70 times in the patients but less than 40 times in 
      the normal controls. Both patients showed no leucoencephalopathy but one showed 
      mild cognitive impairment detected by Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Rimmed 
      vacuoles and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions (INIs) were identified in 
      muscle pathology, and colocalisation of CGG RNA foci with p62 was also found in 
      the INIs of patient-derived fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: We identified another two 
      unrelated cases with CGG repeat expansion in the long non-coding RNA of the 
      LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 gene, presenting with a phenotype of OPDM. Our cases 
      broadened the recognised phenotypic spectrum and pathogenesis in the disease 
      associated with CGG repeat expansion in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an autosomal dominant 
      adult-onset degenerative muscle disorder characterized by ptosis, ophthalmoplegia 
      and weakness of the facial, pharyngeal and limb muscles. Trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions in non-coding regions of LRP12, G1PC1, NOTCH2NLC and RILPL1 were 
      reported to be the etiologies for OPDM. RESULTS: In this study, we performed 
      long-read whole-genome sequencing in a large five-generation family of 156 
      individuals, including 21 patients diagnosed with typical OPDM. We identified CGG 
      repeat expansions in 5'UTR of RILPL1 gene in all patients we tested while no CGG 
      expansion in unaffected family members. Repeat-primed PCR and fluorescence 
      amplicon length analysis PCR were further confirmed the segregation of CGG 
      expansions in other family members and 1000 normal Chinese controls. Methylation 
      analysis indicated that methylation levels of the RILPL1 gene were unaltered in 
      OPDM patients, which was consistent with previous studies. Our findings provide 
      evidence that RILPL1 is associated OPDM in this large pedigree. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results identified RILPL1 is the associated the disease in this large pedigree.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized 
      by the degeneration of motor neurons. Although repeat expansion in C9orf72 is its 
      most common cause, the pathogenesis of ALS isn't fully clear. In this study, we 
      show that repeat expansion in LRP12, a causative variant of oculopharyngodistal 
      myopathy type 1 (OPDM1), is a cause of ALS. We identify CGG repeat expansion in 
      LRP12 in five families and two simplex individuals. These ALS individuals 
      (LRP12-ALS) have 61-100 repeats, which contrasts with most OPDM individuals with 
      repeat expansion in LRP12 (LRP12-OPDM), who have 100-200 repeats. Phosphorylated 
      TDP-43 is present in the cytoplasm of iPS cell-derived motor neurons (iPSMNs) in 
      LRP12-ALS, a finding that reproduces the pathological hallmark of ALS. RNA foci 
      are more prominent in muscle and iPSMNs in LRP12-ALS than in LRP12-OPDM. 
      Muscleblind-like 1 aggregates are observed only in OPDM muscle. In conclusion, 
      CGG repeat expansions in LRP12 cause ALS and OPDM, depending on the length of the 
      repeat. Our findings provide insight into the repeat length-dependent switching 
      of phenotypes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Heterozygous CGG repeat expansions in low-density lipoprotein 
      receptor-related protein 12 (LRP12) have recently been identified as a cause of 
      oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM), and the disease is designated as OPDM type 1 
      (OPDM1). In contrast to broadening of our knowledge on the genetic background of 
      OPDM, what we know of the clinical phenotype of genetically confirmed OPDM1 
      remains limited. METHODS: This investigation was a single-center case series 
      study of OPDM consisting of ten patients from seven families. Repeat-primed 
      polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analyses were performed to confirm 
      the CGG repeat expansions in LRP12. Clinical findings were retrospectively 
      reviewed. RESULTS: Seven patients from five families were identified as having 
      CGG repeat expansions in LRP12. We found a high prevalence of axial muscle 
      involvement, such as neck muscle weakness (6/7) and fatty infiltration in the 
      rectus abdominis muscle, as revealed by computed tomography (5/5). We identified 
      patients with very subtle oculopharyngeal symptoms, mimicking isolated distal 
      myopathy. Muscle specimens were collected from the biceps brachii and tibialis 
      anterior muscles of three patients. Myopathic changes were more severe with more 
      atrophic fibers forming clusters in the tibialis anterior than the biceps brachii 
      muscles of these three patients. No rimmed vacuoles were observed in the biceps 
      brachii muscles in two of the three patients. DISCUSSION: This study shows the 
      expanded clinical spectrum of OPDM1, highlighting the importance of axial muscle 
      evaluation in OPDM1. Considering patients with very subtle oculopharyngeal 
      symptoms, genetic analysis of LRP12 should be considered in patients with 
      isolated distal myopathy.

TI  - GGC Repeat Expansion of RILPL1 is Associated with Oculopharyngodistal Myopathy.
PG  - 512-526
LID - 10.1002/ana.26436 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an adult-onset neuromuscular 
      disease characterized by progressive ptosis, dysarthria, ophthalmoplegia, and 
      distal muscle weakness. Recent studies revealed that GGC repeat expansions in 
      5'-UTR of LRP12, GIPC1, and NOTCH2NLC are associated with OPDM. Despite these 
      advances, approximately 30% of OPDM patients remain genetically undiagnosed. 
      Herein, we aim to investigate the genetic basis for undiagnosed OPDM patients in 
      two unrelated Chinese Han families. METHODS: Parametric linkage analysis was 
      performed. Long-read sequencing followed by repeat-primed polymerase chain 
      reaction and amplicon length polymerase chain reaction were used to determine the 
      genetic cause. Targeted methylation sequencing was implemented to detect 
      epigenetic changes. The possible pathogenesis mechanism was investigated by 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, RNA fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization, and immunofluorescence staining of muscle biopsy samples. RESULTS: 
      The disease locus was mapped to 12q24.3. Subsequently, GGC repeat expansion in 
      the promoter region of RILPL1 was identified in six OPDM patients from two 
      families, findings consistent with a founder effect, designated as OPDM type 4. 
      Targeted methylation sequencing revealed hypermethylation at the RILPL1 locus in 
      unaffected individuals with ultralong expansion. Analysis of muscle samples 
      showed no significant differences in RILPL1 mRNA or RILPL1 protein levels between 
      patients and controls. Public CAGE-seq data indicated that alternative 
      transcription start sites exist upstream of the RefSeq-annotated RILPL1 
      transcription start site. Strand-specific RNA-seq data revealed bidirectional 
      transcription from the RILPL1 locus. Finally, fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization/immunofluorescence staining showed that both sense and antisense 
      transcripts formed RNA foci, and were co-localized with hnRNPA2B1 and p62 in the 
      intranuclear inclusions of OPDM type 4 patients. INTERPRETATION: Our findings 
      implicate abnormal GGC repeat expansions in the promoter region of RILPL1 as a 
      novel genetic cause for OPDM, and suggest a methylation mechanism and a potential 
      RNA toxicity mechanism are involved in OPDM type 4 pathogenesis. ANN NEUROL

AB  - Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is a rare adult-onset hereditary muscular 
      disease characterized by slowly progressive ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia and 
      weakness of the facial, pharyngeal and distal limb muscles. Recently, CGG repeat 
      expansion mutations in three genes, LRP12, GIPC1 and NOTCH2NLC, have been 
      identified as causative factors for OPDM. Here, we report clinicopathologically 
      typical familial OPDM patients from southwestern China. CGG repeat expansions in 
      GIPC1 were detected in two OPDM-affected individuals. Our study was the first 
      GIPC1-OPDM report from southwestern China, further confirming expanded GGC 
      repeats in GIPC1 as the cause of OPDM.

TI  - GIPC1 CGG Repeat Expansion Is Associated with Movement Disorders.
PG  - 704-715
LID - 10.1002/ana.26325 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: CGG/GGC repeat expansion in FMR1 and NOTCH2NLC is reportedly 
      associated with movement disorders; therefore, we hypothesized that the CGG 
      repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1, which was previously identified 
      in myopathy, might also be associated with movement-disorder phenotypes. Here, we 
      investigated whether CGG repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1 
      presents in a cohort of patients with movement disorders. METHODS: We screened 
      for the CGG repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1 in 1,346 
      movement-disorder patients and 1,451 matched healthy controls. RESULTS: No 
      patients or controls harbored expanded CGG repeats in LRP12 or NUTM2B-AS1, 
      whereas 16 patients harbored >40 CGG repeats in GIPC1, with 11 of these patients 
      harboring >60 CGG repeats. One control individual harbored an expanded GIPC1 
      allele (83 CGG units), suggesting that approximately 1% of patients affected by 
      movement disorders in our population might harbor GIPC1 CGG repeat expansion, 
      with this likely extremely rare in healthy controls (<0.001). The clinical 
      phenotypes of the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive patients strongly resembled those in 
      patients displaying NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat-positive movement disorders. 
      Additionally, the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive patients presented white-matter 
      hyperintensities but without typical NOTCH2NLC-related high-intensity signals in 
      the corticomedullary junction. Furthermore, 44% of the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive 
      patients showed a cognitive deficit, and skin biopsies in 2 patients revealed 
      deposition of intranuclear inclusions. INTERPRETATION: The CGG repeat expansion 
      in GIPC1 might be associated with movement-disorder phenotypes and lead to 
      diseases related to intranuclear inclusions. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:704-715.

AB  - Recent studies indicate that CGG repeat expansions in LRP12, GIPC1, and NOTCH2NLC 
      are associated with oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) types 1, 2, and 3, 
      respectively. However, some clinicopathologically confirmed OPDM cases continue 
      to have unknown genetic causes. Here, through a combination of long-read 
      whole-genome sequencing (LRS), repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR), 
      and fluorescence amplicon length analysis PCR (AL-PCR), we found that a CGG 
      repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of RILPL1 is associated with familial and simplex 
      OPDM type 4 (OPDM4). The number of repeats ranged from 139 to 197. Methylation 
      analysis indicates that the methylation levels in RILPL1 were unaltered in OPDM4 
      individuals. Analyses of muscle biopsies suggested that the expanded CGG repeat 
      might be translated into a toxic poly-glycine protein that co-localizes with p62 
      in intranuclear inclusions. Moreover, analyses suggest that the toxic RNA 
      gain-of-function effects also contributed to the pathogenesis of this disease. 
      Intriguingly, all four types of OPDM have been found to be associated with the 
      CGG repeat expansions located in 5' UTRs. This finding suggests that a common 
      pathogenic mechanism, driven by the CGG repeat expansion, might underlie all 
      cases of OPDM.

TI  - Intranuclear inclusions in skin biopsies are not limited to neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusion disease but can also be seen in oculopharyngodistal myopathy.
PG  - e12787

AB  - AIMS: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is caused by the expansion of CGG 
      repeats in NOTCH2NLC (OPDM_NOTCH2NLC) GIPC1 (OPDM_GIPC1), or LRP12 (OPDM_LRP12). 
      Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is clinically distinct from OPDM 
      but is also caused by the expansion of CGG repeats in NOTCH2NLC, which may be an 
      indicator of intranuclear inclusion in skin biopsy. We investigated the presence 
      of intranuclear inclusions in skin biopsies from patients with OPDM and muscle 
      diseases with a similar pathology to evaluate whether they will have similar 
      diagnostic findings on skin biopsy. METHODS: We analysed the frequency of 
      p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in sweat gland cells, adipocytes and 
      fibroblasts in skin biopsy samples from patients with OPDM (OPDM_NOTCH2NLC 
      [n = 2], OPDM_GIPC1 [n = 6] and OPDM_LRP12 [n = 3]), NIID (n = 1), OPMD (n = 1), 
      IBM (n = 4) and GNE myopathy (n = 2). RESULTS: The p62-postive intranuclear 
      inclusions were observed in all three cell types in both patients with 
      OPDM_NOTCH2NLC and a patient with NIID, in at least one cell type in all six 
      patients with OPDM_GIPC1, and all in three cell types in one of the three 
      patients with OPDM_LRP12. These findings were not observed in patients with OPMD, 
      IBM or GNE myopathy. CONCLUSION: Intranuclear inclusions in skin biopsy samples 
      are not specific to NIID and are found in all three types of genetically 
      confirmed OPDM, suggesting that the underlying mechanism of OPDM may be similar 
      to NIID, regardless of causative genes.

TI  - Clinicopathologic Features of Oculopharyngodistal Myopathy With LRP12 CGG Repeat 
      Expansions Compared With Other Oculopharyngodistal Myopathy Subtypes.
PG  - 853-863
LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2021.1509 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Repeat expansion of CGG in LRP12 has been identified as the causative 
      variation of oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM). However, to our knowledge, the 
      clinicopathologic features of OPDM with CGG repeat expansion in LRP12 (hereafter 
      referred to as OPDM_LRP12) remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: To identify and 
      characterize the clinicopathologic features of patients with OPDM_LRP12. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case series included 208 patients with a clinical 
      or clinicopathologic diagnosis of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPDM) from 
      January 1, 1978, to December 31, 2020. Patients with GCN repeat expansions in 
      PABPN1 were excluded from the study. Repeat expansions of CGG in LRP12 were 
      screened by repeat primed polymerase chain reaction and/or Southern blot. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical information, muscle imaging data obtained by 
      either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, and muscle pathologic 
      characteristics. RESULTS: Sixty-five Japanese patients with OPDM (40 men [62%]; 
      mean [SD] age at onset, 41.0 [10.1] years) from 59 families with CGG repeat 
      expansions in LRP12 were identified. This represents the most common OPDM subtype 
      among all patients in Japan with genetically diagnosed OPDM. The expansions 
      ranged from 85 to 289 repeats. A negative correlation was observed between the 
      repeat size and the age at onset (r2 = 0.188, P = .001). The most common initial 
      symptoms were ptosis and muscle weakness, present in 24 patients (37%). Limb 
      muscle weakness was predominantly distal in 53 of 64 patients (83%), but 2 of 64 
      patients (3%) had predominantly proximal muscle weakness. Ptosis was observed in 
      62 of 64 patients (97%), and dysphagia or dysarthria was observed in 63 of 64 
      patients (98%). A total of 21 of 64 patients (33%) had asymmetric muscle 
      weakness. Aspiration pneumonia was seen in 11 of 64 patients (17%), and 5 of 64 
      patients (8%) required mechanical ventilation. Seven of 64 patients (11%) 
      developed cardiac abnormalities, and 5 of 64 patients (8%) developed neurologic 
      abnormalities. Asymmetric muscle involvement was detected on computed tomography 
      scans in 6 of 27 patients (22%) and on magnetic resonance imaging scans in 4 of 
      15 patients (27%), with the soleus and the medial head of the gastrocnemius being 
      the worst affected. All 42 muscle biopsy samples showed rimmed vacuoles. 
      Intranuclear tubulofilamentous inclusions were observed in only 1 of 5 patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that OPDM_LRP12 is the most 
      frequent OPDM subtype in Japan and is characterized by oculopharyngeal weakness, 
      distal myopathy that especially affects the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, and 
      rimmed vacuoles in muscle biopsy.

TI  - The GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC is associated with oculopharyngodistal 
      myopathy type 3.
PG  - 1819-1832
LID - 10.1093/brain/awab077 [doi]
AB  - Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an adult-onset neuromuscular disease 
      characterized by progressive ocular, facial, pharyngeal and distal limb muscle 
      involvement. Trinucleotide repeat expansions in LRP12 or GIPC1 were recently 
      reported to be associated with OPDM. However, a significant portion of OPDM 
      patients have unknown genetic causes. In this study, long-read whole-genome 
      sequencing and repeat-primed PCR were performed and we identified GGC repeat 
      expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene in 16.7% (4/24) of a cohort of Chinese OPDM 
      patients, designated as OPDM type 3 (OPDM3). Methylation analysis indicated that 
      methylation levels of the NOTCH2NLC gene were unaltered in OPDM3 patients, but 
      increased significantly in asymptomatic carriers. Quantitative real-time PCR 
      analysis indicated that NOTCH2NLC mRNA levels were increased in muscle but not in 
      blood of OPDM3 patients. Immunofluorescence on OPDM muscle samples and expressing 
      mutant NOTCH2NLC with (GGC)69 repeat expansions in HEK293 cells indicated that 
      mutant NOTCH2NLC-polyglycine protein might be a major component of intranuclear 
      inclusions, and contribute to toxicity in cultured cells. In addition, two 
      RNA-binding proteins, hnRNP A/B and MBNL1, were both co-localized with p62 in 
      intranuclear inclusions in OPDM muscle samples. These results indicated that a 
      toxic protein gain-of-function mechanism and RNA gain-of-function mechanism may 
      both play a vital role in the pathogenic processes of OPDM3. This study extended 
      the spectrum of NOTCH2NLC repeat expansion-related diseases to a predominant 
      myopathy phenotype presenting as OPDM, and provided evidence for possible 
      pathogenesis of these diseases.

TI  - 5' UTR CGG repeat expansion in GIPC1 is associated with oculopharyngodistal 
      myopathy.
PG  - 601-614
LID - 10.1093/brain/awaa426 [doi]
AB  - Oculopharyngodistal myopathy is a late-onset degenerative muscle disorder 
      characterized by ptosis and weakness of the facial, pharyngeal, and distal limb 
      muscles. A recent report suggested a non-coding trinucleotide repeat expansion in 
      LRP12 to be associated with the disease. Here we report a genetic study in a 
      Chinese cohort of 41 patients with the clinical diagnosis of oculopharyngodistal 
      myopathy (21 cases from seven families and 20 sporadic cases). In a large family 
      with 12 affected individuals, combined haplotype and linkage analysis revealed a 
      maximum two-point logarithm of the odds (LOD) score of 3.3 in chromosomal region 
      chr19p13.11-p13.2 and narrowed the candidate region to an interval of 4.5 Mb. 
      Using a comprehensive strategy combining whole-exome sequencing, long-read 
      sequencing, repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction and GC-rich polymerase chain 
      reaction, we identified an abnormal CGG repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of the 
      GIPC1 gene that co-segregated with disease. Overall, the repeat expansion in 
      GIPC1 was identified in 51.9% independent pedigrees (4/7 families and 10/20 
      sporadic cases), while the repeat expansion in LRP12 was only identified in one 
      sporadic case (3.7%) in our cohort. The number of CGG repeats was <30 in controls 
      but >60 in affected individuals. There was a slight correlation between repeat 
      size and the age at onset. Both repeat expansion and retraction were observed 
      during transmission but somatic instability was not evident. These results 
      further support that non-coding CGG repeat expansion plays an essential role in 
      the pathogenesis of oculopharyngodistal myopathy.

AB  - Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is a rare hereditary muscle disease 
      characterized by progressive distal limb weakness, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, 
      bulbar muscle weakness and rimmed vacuoles on muscle biopsy. Recently, CGG repeat 
      expansions in the noncoding regions of two genes, LRP12 and GIPC1, have been 
      reported to be causative for OPDM. Furthermore, neuronal intranuclear inclusion 
      disease (NIID) has been recently reported to be caused by CGG repeat expansions 
      in NOTCH2NLC. We aimed to identify and to clinicopathologically characterize 
      patients with OPDM who have CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC (OPDM_NOTCH2NLC). 
      Note that 211 patients from 201 families, who were clinically or 
      clinicopathologically diagnosed with OPDM or oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, 
      were screened for CGG expansions in NOTCH2NLC by repeat primed-PCR. Clinical 
      information and muscle pathology slides of identified patients with 
      OPDM_NOTCH2NLC were re-reviewed. Intra-myonuclear inclusions were evaluated using 
      immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy (EM). Seven Japanese OPDM patients 
      had CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC. All seven patients clinically 
      demonstrated ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, dysarthria and muscle weakness; they 
      myopathologically had intra-myonuclear inclusions stained with 
      anti-poly-ubiquitinated proteins, anti-SUMO1 and anti-p62 antibodies, which were 
      diagnostic of NIID (typically on skin biopsy), in addition to rimmed vacuoles. 
      The sample for EM was available only from one patient, which demonstrated 
      intranuclear inclusions of 12.6 +/- 1.6 nm in diameter. We identified seven 
      patients with OPDM_NOTCH2NLC. Our patients had various additional central and/or 
      peripheral nervous system involvement, although all were clinicopathologically 
      compatible; thus, they were diagnosed as having OPDM and expanding a phenotype of 
      the neuromyodegenerative disease caused by CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC.

PG  - 1222-1232

AB  - Noncoding repeat expansions cause various neuromuscular diseases, including 
      myotonic dystrophies, fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome, some spinocerebellar 
      ataxias, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and benign adult familial myoclonic 
      epilepsies. Inspired by the striking similarities in the clinical and 
      neuroimaging findings between neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) and 
      fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome caused by noncoding CGG repeat expansions in 
      FMR1, we directly searched for repeat expansion mutations and identified 
      noncoding CGG repeat expansions in NBPF19 (NOTCH2NLC) as the causative mutations 
      for NIID. Further prompted by the similarities in the clinical and neuroimaging 
      findings with NIID, we identified similar noncoding CGG repeat expansions in two 
      other diseases: oculopharyngeal myopathy with leukoencephalopathy and 
      oculopharyngodistal myopathy, in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 and LRP12, respectively. 
      These findings expand our knowledge of the clinical spectra of diseases caused by 
      expansions of the same repeat motif, and further highlight how directly searching 
      for expanded repeats can help identify mutations underlying diseases.

TI  - MLVA and MLST typing of Brucella from Qinghai, China.
PG  - 26
LID - 10.1186/s40249-016-0123-z [doi]
LID - 26
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) of China is an extensive pastoral and 
      semi-pastoral area, and because of poverty and bad hygiene conditions, Brucella 
      is highly prevalent in this region. In order to adequately prevent this disease 
      in the QTP region it is important to determine the identity of Brucella species 
      that caused the infection. METHODS: A total of 65 Brucella isolates were obtained 
      from human, livestock and wild animals in Qinghai, a Chinese province in east of 
      the QTP. Two molecular typing methods, MLVA (multi-locus variable-number 
      tandem-repeat analysis) and MLST (multi locus sequence typing) were used to 
      identify the species and genotypes of these isolates. FINDINGS: Both MLVA and 
      MLST typing methods classified the 65 isolates into three species, B. melitensis, 
      B. abortus and B. suis, which included 60, 4 and 1 isolates respectively. The 
      MLVA method uniquely detected 34 (Bm01 ~ Bm34), 3 (Ba01 ~ Ba03), and 1 (Bs01) 
      MLVA-16 genotypes for B. melitensis, B. abortus and B. suis, respectively. 
      However, none of these genotypes exactly matched any of the genotypes in the 
      Brucella2012 MLVA database. The MLST method identified five known ST types: ST7 
      and ST8 (B. melitensis), ST2 and ST5 (B. abortus), and ST14 (B. suis). We also 
      detected a strain with a mutant type (3-2-3-2-?-5-3-8-2) of ST8 
      (3-2-3-2-1-5-3-8-2). Extensive genotype-sharing events could be observed among 
      isolates from different host species. CONCLUSIONS: There were at least three 
      Brucella (B. melitensis, B. abortus and B. suis) species in Qinghai, of which B. 
      melitensis was the predominant species in the area examined. The Brucella 
      population in Qinghai was very different from other regions of the world, 
      possibly owing to the unique geographical characteristics such as extremely high 
      altitude in QTP. There were extensive genotype-sharing events between isolates 
      obtained from humans and other animals. Yaks, sheep and blue sheep were important 
      zoonotic reservoirs of brucellosis causing species found in humans.
