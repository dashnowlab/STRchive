AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiomyopathy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous heart 
      condition that can lead to heart failure and sudden cardiac death in childhood. 
      While it has a strong genetic basis, the genetic aetiology for over 50% of 
      cardiomyopathy cases remains unknown. METHODS: In this study, we analyse the 
      characteristics of tandem repeats from genome sequence data of unrelated 
      individuals diagnosed with cardiomyopathy from Canada and the United Kingdom 
      (n = 1216) and compare them to those found in the general population. We perform 
      burden analysis to identify genomic and epigenomic features that are impacted by 
      rare tandem repeat expansions (TREs), and enrichment analysis to identify 
      functional pathways that are involved in the TRE-associated genes in 
      cardiomyopathy. We use Oxford Nanopore targeted long-read sequencing to validate 
      repeat size and methylation status of one of the most recurrent TREs. We also 
      compare the TRE-associated genes to those that are dysregulated in the heart 
      tissues of individuals with cardiomyopathy. FINDINGS: We demonstrate that tandem 
      repeats that are rarely expanded in the general population are predominantly 
      expanded in cardiomyopathy. We find that rare TREs are disproportionately present 
      in constrained genes near transcriptional start sites, have high GC content, and 
      frequently overlap active enhancer H3K27ac marks, where expansion-related DNA 
      methylation may reduce gene expression. We demonstrate the gene silencing effect 
      of expanded CGG tandem repeats in DIP2B through promoter hypermethylation. We 
      show that the enhancer-associated loci are found in genes that are highly 
      expressed in human cardiomyocytes and are differentially expressed in the left 
      ventricle of the heart in individuals with cardiomyopathy. INTERPRETATION: Our 
      findings highlight the underrecognized contribution of rare tandem repeat 
      expansions to the risk of cardiomyopathy and suggest that rare TREs contribute to 
       approximately 4% of cardiomyopathy risk. FUNDING: Government of Ontario (RKCY), The Canadian

AB  - Long-read HiFi genome sequencing allows for accurate detection and direct phasing 
      of single nucleotide variants, indels, and structural variants. Recent 
      algorithmic development enables simultaneous detection of CpG methylation for 
      analysis of regulatory element activity directly in HiFi reads. We present a 
      comprehensive haplotype resolved 5-base HiFi genome sequencing dataset from a 
      rare disease cohort of 276 samples in 152 families to identify rare (~0.5%) 
      hypermethylation events. We find that 80% of these events are allele-specific and 
      predicted to cause loss of regulatory element activity. We demonstrate 
      heritability of extreme hypermethylation including rare cis variants associated 
      with short (~200 bp) and large hypermethylation events (>1 kb), respectively. We 
      identify repeat expansions in proximal promoters predicting allelic gene 
      silencing via hypermethylation and demonstrate allelic transcriptional events 
      downstream. On average 30-40 rare hypermethylation tiles overlap rare disease 
      genes per patient, providing indications for variation prioritization including a 
      previously undiagnosed pathogenic allele in DIP2B causing global developmental 
      delay. We propose that use of HiFi genome sequencing in unsolved rare disease 
      cases will allow detection of unconventional diseases alleles due to loss of 
      regulatory element activity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by pathogenic variants in 
      the dystrophin gene (DMD). Hypermethylated CGG expansions within DIP2B 5' UTR are 
      associated with an intellectual development disorder. Here, we demonstrate the 
      diagnostic utility of genomic short-read sequencing (SRS) and transcriptome 
      sequencing to identify a novel DMD structural variant (SV) and a DIP2B CGG 
      expansion in a patient with DMD for whom conventional diagnostic testing failed 
      to yield a genetic diagnosis. METHODS: We performed genomic SRS, skeletal muscle 
      transcriptome sequencing, and targeted programmable long-read sequencing (LRS). 
      RESULTS: The proband had a typical DMD clinical presentation, autism spectrum 
      disorder (ASD), and dystrophinopathy on muscle biopsy. Transcriptome analysis 
      identified 6 aberrantly expressed genes; DMD and DIP2B were the strongest 
      underexpression and overexpression outliers, respectively. Genomic SRS identified 
      a 216 kb paracentric inversion (NC_000023.11: g.33162217-33378800) overlapping 2 
      DMD promoters. ExpansionHunter indicated an expansion of 109 CGG repeats within 
      the 5' UTR of DIP2B. Targeted genomic LRS confirmed the SV and genotyped the 
      DIP2B repeat expansion as 270 CGG repeats. DISCUSSION: Here, transcriptome data 
      heavily guided genomic analysis to resolve a complex DMD inversion and a DIP2B 
      repeat expansion. Longitudinal follow-up will be important for clarifying the 
      clinical significance of the DIP2B genotype.

AB  - Epilepsies are a group of common neurological disorders with a substantial 
      genetic basis. Despite this, the molecular diagnosis of epilepsies remains 
      challenging due to its heterogeneity. Studies utilizing whole-genome sequencing 
      may provide additional insights into genetic causes of epilepsies of unknown 
      aetiology. Whole-genome sequencing was used to evaluate a cohort of adults with 
      unexplained developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (n = 30), for whom prior 
      genetic tests, including whole-exome sequencing in some cases, were negative or 
      inconclusive. Rare single nucleotide variants, insertions/deletions, copy number 
      variants and tandem repeat expansions were analysed. Seven pathogenic or likely 
      pathogenic single nucleotide variants, and two pathogenic deleterious copy number 
      variants were identified in nine patients (32.1% of the cohort). One of the copy 
      number variants, identified in a patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, was too 
      small to be detected by chromosomal microarray techniques. We also identified two 
      tandem repeat expansions with clinical implications in two other patients with 
      Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: a CGG repeat expansion in the 5'untranslated region of 
      DIP2B, and a CTG expansion in ATXN8OS (previously implicated in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 8). Three patients had KCNA2 pathogenic variants. One of them died of 
      sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. The other two patients had, in addition to a 
      KCNA2 variant, a second de novo variant impacting potential epilepsy-relevant 
      genes (KCNIP4 and UBR5). Overall, whole-genome sequencing provided a genetic 
      explanation in 32.1% of the total cohort. This is also the first report of coding 
      and non-coding tandem repeat expansions identified in patients with 
      Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This study demonstrates that using whole-genome 
      sequencing, the examination of multiple types of rare genetic variation, 
      including those found in the non-coding region of the genome, can help resolve 
      unexplained epilepsies.

TI  - CGG-repeat expansion in the DIP2B gene is associated with the fragile site FRA12A 
      on chromosome 12q13.1.
PG  - 221-31
AB  - A high level of cytogenetic expression of the rare folate-sensitive fragile site 
      FRA12A is significantly associated with mental retardation. Here, we identify an 
      elongated polymorphic CGG repeat as the molecular basis of FRA12A. This repeat is 
      in the 5' untranslated region of the gene DIP2B, which encodes a protein with a 
      DMAP1-binding domain, which suggests a role in DNA methylation machinery. DIP2B 
      mRNA levels were halved in two subjects with FRA12A with mental retardation in 
      whom the repeat expansion was methylated. In two individuals without mental 
      retardation but with an expanded and methylated repeat, DIP2B expression was 
      reduced to approximately two-thirds of the values observed in controls. 
      Interestingly, a carrier of an unmethylated CGG-repeat expansion showed increased 
      levels of DIP2B mRNA, which suggests that the repeat elongation increases gene 
      expression, as previously described for the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome. These data suggest that deficiency of DIP2B, a brain-expressed gene, 
      may mediate the neurocognitive problems associated with FRA12A.
