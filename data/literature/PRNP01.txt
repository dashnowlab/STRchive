AB  - BACKGROUND: The term rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) with Lewy bodies (rpDLB) 
      is used for DLB patients who develop a rapidly progressive neurological syndrome 
      and have reduced survival. Here, we characterise the clinical, neuropathological, 
      and molecular characteristics of a large rpDLB neuropathological series. METHODS: 
      We included all RPD patients with a disease duration < 4 years submitted to our 
      prion disease referral centre between 2003 and 2022 who showed Lewy body 
      pathology (LBP) in limbic or neocortical stages as primary neuropathological 
      diagnosis, had no systemic condition justifying the rapid deterioration and were 
      previously neurologically unimpaired. Clinical features were retrieved and 
      compared with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and rapidly progressive Alzheimer's 
      disease (rpAD) cohorts. Neuropathological and genetic (whole exome sequencing, 
      APOE genotyping, and C9orf72 repeat expansion analysis) characteristics of rpDLB 
      patients were systematically investigated. We scored semi-quantitatively the LBP 
      load and performed a alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn) RT-QuIC seeding amplification assay (SAA) 
      on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and tenfold serially diluted brain homogenates from 
      different brain areas in rpDLB patients and typical long-lasting Lewy body 
      disease (LBD) with dementia patients as control group. RESULTS: RpDLB patients 
      were older (p = 0.047) and presented more cognitive fluctuations (p = 0.005), 
      visual hallucinations (p = 0.020), neuropsychiatric symptoms (p = 0.006) and 
      seizures (p = 0.032), and fewer cerebellar (p < 0.001) and visual (p = 0.004) 
      signs than CJD ones. Delirium onset was more common than in both CJD (p < 0.001) 
      and rpAD (p = 0.008). Atypical LBD signs (pyramidal, myoclonus, akinetic mutism) 
      were common. All tested patients were positive by CSF alphaSyn SAA. Concomitant 
      pathologies were common, with only four cases showing relatively "pure" LBP. LBP 
      load and alphaSyn seeding activity measured through alphaSyn RT-QuIC SAA were not 
      significantly different between rpDLB patients and typical LBD. We found a likely 
      pathogenic variant in GBA in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that: 
      1) rpDLB exhibits a distinct clinical signature (2) CSF alphaSyn SAA is a reliable 
      diagnostic test; 3) rpDLB is a heterogeneous neuropathological entity that can be 
      underlain by both widespread pure LBP, or multiple copathologies 4) rpDLB is 
      likely not sustained by distinct alphaSyn conformational strains; 5) genetic defects 
      may, at least occasionally, contribute to the poor prognosis in these patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To perform a screening for Huntington disease (HD) phenocopies in a 
      Swedish cohort. METHODS: Seventy-three DNA samples negative for HD were assessed 
      at a tertiary center in Stockholm. The screening included analyses for 
      C9orf72-frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9orf72-FTD/ALS), 
      octapeptide repeat insertions (OPRIs) in PRNP associated with inherited prion 
      diseases (IPD), Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2), spinocerebellar ataxia-2 
      (SCA2), spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) and spinocerebellar ataxia-17 (SCA17). 
      Targeted genetic analysis was carried out in two cases based on the salient 
      phenotypic features. RESULTS: The screening identified two patients with SCA17, 
      one patient with IPD associated with 5-OPRI but none with nucleotide expansions 
      in C9orf72 or for HDL2, SCA2 or SCA3. Furthermore, SGCE-myoclonic-dystonia 11 
      (SGCE-M-D) and benign hereditary chorea (BHC) was diagnosed in two sporadic 
      cases. WES identified VUS in STUB1 in two patients with predominant cerebellar 
      ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in keeping with previous screenings and 
      suggest that other genes yet to be discovered are involved in the etiology of HD 
      phenocopies.

AB  - The N-terminus of the PRNP gene normally contains a 5-octapeptide repeat 
      (R1-R2-R2-R3-R4), and insertions at this locus can cause hereditary prion 
      diseases. In the present study, we found a 5-octapeptide repeat insertion 
      (5-OPRI) in a sibling case of frontotemporal dementia. Consistent with previous 
      literature, 5-OPRI rarely met the diagnostic criteria for Creutzfeldt...Jakob 
      disease (CJD). We propose 5-OPRI as a suspected causative mutation for 
      early-onset dementia, especially the frontotemporal type.

TI  - Clinical and Molecular Findings of Intermediate Allele Carriers in the HTT Gene 
      from the Mexican Mestizo Population.
PG  - 34-42
LID - 10.1159/000526260 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are reports of different clinical statuses in carriers of 
      intermediate alleles (IAs) of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the HTT gene, from 
      individuals affected by a clinical picture indistinguishable from Huntington's 
      disease (HD) to those without manifestations. Therefore, the possible clinical 
      significance of these alleles has been widely debated. OBJECTIVES: The aim of 
      this study was to describe general and clinical features and discard HD 
      phenocopies by molecular assessment in a case series of IA carriers on the HTT 
      gene of a laboratory sample from a neurological center in Mexico. METHODS: We 
      selected individuals who had previously been tested for the HTT gene expansion, 
      which resulted in IAs. Clinical information was obtained from medical records, 
      and molecular analysis of the JPH3, PRNP, and TBP genes was performed only in IA 
      carriers with clinical manifestations. In addition, two patients with IA and 
      acanthocytes were evaluated by whole-exome sequencing. The scientific and ethical 
      committees of the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery Manuel Velasco 
      Suarez (NINNMVS) approved this study. RESULTS: From 1994 to 2019, the Genetics 
      Department of the NINNMVS confirmed 34 individuals with IAs, 15 of whom belonged 
      to 11 families with HD (IA-HD) and 19 of whom had no family history of HD 
      (IA-non-HD). We found a high proportion of manifestations of the HD phenotypic 
      spectrum in the IA-non-HD subgroup. In addition, among the 20 samples of IA 
      carriers with manifestations molecularly evaluated, we identified two unrelated 
      subjects with CAG/CTG repeat expansions on the JPH3 gene, confirming HD-like 2 
      (HDL2), and one patient with the homozygous pathogenic c.3232G>T variant 
      (p.Glu1078Ter) in the VPS13A gene, demonstrating choreoacanthocytosis. 
      DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Our results show the most extensive series of subjects 
      with IAs and clinical manifestations. In addition, we identify three HD 
      phenocopies, two HDL2 cases, and one choreoacanthocytosis case. Therefore, we 
      emphasize evaluating other HD phenocopies in IA carriers with clinical 
      manifestations whose family background is not associated with HD.

AB  - Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) also known as prion diseases, 
      are fatal neurodegenerative diseases. Prion diseases are caused by abnormal prion 
      protein (PrP(Sc)) derived from normal prion protein (PrP(C)), which is encoded by 
      the prion protein gene (PRNP). Prion diseases have been reported in several 
      mammals. Notably, chickens, one species of bird, have not been reported to 
      develop prion diseases and showed resistance to bovine spongiform encephalopathy 
      (BSE) infection. However, genetic polymorphisms of the PRNP gene and protein 
      structure of the prion protein (PrP) related to vulnerability to prion diseases 
      have not been investigated in pheasants, another species of bird. We performed 
      amplicon sequencing of the pheasant PRNP gene to identify genetic polymorphisms 
      in 148 pheasants. We analyzed the genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies of 
      the pheasant PRNP polymorphisms. In addition, we evaluated the effect of genetic 
      polymorphisms of the pheasant PRNP gene on pheasant PrP by the AMYCO, PROVEAN, 
      PolyPhen-2 and PANTHER softwares. Furthermore, we compared the amino acid 
      sequences of tandem repeat domains and secondary and tertiary structures of prion 
      proteins (PrPs) among several animals. Finally, we investigated the impact of 
      non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on hydrogen bonds and 
      tertiary structures of pheasant PrP by Swiss PDB viewer software. We identified 
      34 novel genetic polymorphisms of the pheasant PRNP gene including 8 
      non-synonymous SNPs and 6 insertion/deletion polymorphisms. Among the 
      non-synonymous SNPs, the L23F, G33C and R177Q SNPs showed that they could have a 
      deleterious effect on pheasant PrP. In addition, the R177Q SNP was predicted to 
      show an increase in amyloid propensity and a reduction in hydrogen bonds of 
      pheasant PrP. Among the insertion/deletion polymorphisms, 
      c.163_180delAACCCGGGGTATCCCCAC showed that it could have a detrimental effect on 
      pheasant PrP. Furthermore, secondary and tertiary structures of pheasant PrP were 
      predicted to have structures similar to those of chicken PrP. To the best of our 
      knowledge, this is the first study on genetic polymorphisms of the pheasant PRNP 
      gene.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early-onset dementias (EOD) are predominantly genetically 
      determined, but the underlying disease-causing alterations are often unknown. The 
      most frequent forms of EODs are early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and 
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD). PATIENTS: This study included 120 Hungarian 
      patients with EOD (48 familial and 72 sporadic) which had a diagnosis of EOAD 
      (n = 49), FTD (n = 49), or atypical dementia (n = 22). RESULTS: Monogenic 
      dementia was detected in 15.8% of the patients. A pathogenic hexanucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene was present in 6.7% of cases and 
      disease-causing variants were detected in other known AD or FTD genes in 6.7% of 
      cases (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, GRN). A compound heterozygous alteration of the TREM2 
      gene was identified in one patient and heterozygous damaging variants in the 
      CSF1R and PRNP genes were detected in two other cases. In two patients, the 
      coexistence of several heterozygous damaging rare variants associated with 
      neurodegeneration was detected (1.7%). The APOE genotype had a high odds ratio 
      for both the APOE varepsilon4/3 and the varepsilon4/4 genotype (OR = 2.7 (95%CI = 1.3-5.9) and 
      OR = 6.5 (95%CI = 1.4-29.2), respectively). In TREM2, SORL1, and ABCA7 genes, 5 
      different rare damaging variants were detected as genetic risk factors. These 
      alterations were not present in the control group. CONCLUSION: Based on our 
      observations, a comprehensive, targeted panel of next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
      testing investigating several neurodegeneration-associated genes may accelerate 
      the path to achieve the proper genetic diagnosis since phenotypes are present on 
      a spectrum. This can also reveal hidden correlations and overlaps in 
      neurodegenerative diseases that would remain concealed in separated genetic 
      testing.

AB  - Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative conditions that affect humans and 
      animals. Rapid and accurate sequencing of the prion gene PRNP is paramount to 
      human prion disease diagnosis and for animal surveillance programmes. Current 
      methods for PRNP genotyping involve sequencing of small fragments within the 
      protein-coding region. The contribution of variants in the non-coding regions of 
      PRNP including large structural changes is poorly understood. Here, we used 
      long-range PCR and Nanopore sequencing to sequence the full length of PRNP, 
      including its regulatory region, in 25 samples from blood and brain of 
      individuals with inherited or sporadic prion diseases. Nanopore sequencing 
      detected the same variants as identified by Sanger sequencing, including repeat 
      expansions/deletions. Nanopore identified additional single-nucleotide variants 
      in the non-coding regions of PRNP, but no novel structural variants were 
      discovered. Finally, we explored somatic mosaicism of PRNP's octapeptide repeat 
      region, which is a hypothetical cause of sporadic prion disease. While we found 
      changes consistent with somatic mutations, we demonstrate that they may have been 
      generated by the PCR. Our study illustrates the accuracy of Nanopore sequencing 
      for rapid and field prion disease diagnosis and highlights the need for 
      single-molecule sequencing methods for the detection of somatic mutations.

TI  - Co-incidental C9orf72 expansion mutation-related frontotemporal lobar 
      degeneration pathology and sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
PG  - 1009-1015
LID - 10.1111/ene.14621 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansion mutation is the most common 
      cause of genetic frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (ALS) and combined FTD-ALS. Its underlying neuropathology combines TDP-43 
      pathology and dipeptide repeat protein (DPR) deposits and may also associate with 
      other neurodegeneration-associated protein aggregates. Herein we present a unique 
      combination of C9orf72 mutation with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in 
      a 74-year-old patient with rapidly progressive dementia. METHODS: Detailed 
      neuropathological examination including immunohistochemistry for several 
      proteinopathies. Genetic analysis was conducted by repeat primed polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR). Furthermore, we analyzed additional C9orf72 mutation carriers for 
      prion-protein (PrP) deposits in brain tissue and screened the cerebellar cortex 
      of other CJD cases for p62/DPR neuronal inclusions to assess the frequency of 
      combined pathologies. RESULTS: Postmortem brain examination of a patient with a 
      rapidly progressive neurological deterioration of 8 months' duration confirmed 
      the diagnosis of CJD. She harbored valine homozygosity at PRNP codon 129. In 
      addition, a frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)-pattern with TDP-43 protein 
      aggregates and p62+/C9RANT+ positive inclusions along with a high degree of 
      Alzheimer-related pathology (A3B3C3) were identified. The suspected C9orf72 
      expansion mutation was confirmed by repeat-primed PCR. Screening of 13 C9orf72 
      cases showed no pathological PrP aggregates and screening of 100 CJD cases 
      revealed no other C9orf72 expansion mutation carriers. CONCLUSION: A combination 
      of a C9orf72 expansion mutation-related FTLD with sporadic CJD in the same 
      patient is rare. While the rarity of both diseases makes this concurrence most 
      likely to be coincidental, questions regarding a potential link between these two 
      neurodegenerative pathologies deserve further studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prion diseases are zoonotic diseases with a broad infection spectrum 
      among mammalian hosts and are caused by the misfolded prion protein (PrP(Sc)) 
      derived from the normal prion protein (PrP(C)), which encodes the prion protein 
      gene (PRNP). Currently, although several prion disease-resistant animals have 
      been reported, a high dose of prion agent inoculation triggers prion disease 
      infection in these disease-resistant animals. However, in chickens, natural prion 
      disease-infected cases have not been reported, and experimental challenges with 
      prion agents have failed to cause infection. Unlike other prion disease-resistant 
      animals, chickens have shown perfect resistance to prion disease thus far. Thus, 
      investigation of the chicken PRNP gene could improve for understanding the 
      mechanism of perfect prion-disease resistance. Here, we investigated the genetic 
      characteristics of the open reading frame (ORF) of the chicken PRNP gene in a 
      large sampling of various chicken breeds. RESULTS: We found only tandem repeat 
      deletion polymorphisms of the chicken PRNP ORF in the 4 chicken breeds including 
      106 Dekalb White, 100 Ross, 98 Ogolgye and 100 Korean native chickens. In 
      addition, the distribution of chicken insertion/deletion polymorphisms was 
      significantly different among the 4 chicken breeds. Finally, we found significant 
      differences in the number of PRNP SNPs between prion disease-susceptible species 
      and prion disease-resistant species. Notably, chickens lack SNPs in the ORF of 
      the prion protein. CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that the absence of SNPs 
      in the chicken PRNP ORF is a notable feature of animals with perfect resistant to 
      prion disease.

AB  - A lot of effort has been done to unravel the genetics underlying early-onset 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). However, 
      many familial early-onset dementia (EOD) cases still show an unclear genetic 
      background. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the known causative 
      mutations and possible pathogenic variants associated with AD and FTLD in a 
      Finnish EOD cohort. The cohort consisted of 39 patients (mean age at onset 54.8 
      years, range 39-65) with a positive family history of dementia or an atypical or 
      rapidly progressive course of the disease. None of the patients carried the 
      C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion. Mutations and variants in APP, PSEN1, 
      PSEN2, MAPT, GRN, VCP, CHMP2B, FUS, TARDBP, TREM2, TMEM106B, UBQLN2, SOD1, PRNP, 
      UBQLN1, and BIN1 were screened by using a targeted next generation sequencing 
      panel. Two previously reported pathogenic mutations (PSEN1 p.His163Arg and MAPT 
      p.Arg406Trp) were identified in the cohort. Both patients had familial dementia 
      with an atypical early onset phenotype. In addition, a heterozygous p.Arg71Trp 
      mutation in PSEN2 with an uncertain pathogenic nature was identified in a patient 
      with neuropathologically confirmed AD. In conclusion, targeted investigation of 
      the known dementia-linked genes is worthwhile in patients with onset age under 55 
      and a positive family history, as well as in patients with atypical features.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The disease course of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) can be 
      rapidly progressive, clinically resembling Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease (CJD). To 
      better understand factors contributing to this rapidly progressive disease 
      course, we describe load and distribution of neuropathology, and the presence of 
      possible disease-associated genetic defects in a post-mortem series of DLB cases 
      clinically suspected of CJD. METHODS: We included pathologically confirmed DLB 
      cases with a disease duration of 3.5 years or less from the Dutch Surveillance 
      Center for Prion Diseases, collected between 1998 and 2014. Lewy body disease 
      (LBD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathology were staged and 
      semi-quantitatively scored in selected brain regions. Whole exome sequencing 
      analysis of known disease-associated genes, copy number analysis, APOE epsilon 
      genotyping and C9orf72 repeat expansion analysis were performed to identify 
      defects in genes with a well-established involvement in Parkinson's disease or 
      AD. RESULTS: Diffuse LBD was present in nine cases, transitional LBD in six cases 
      and brainstem-predominant LBD in one case. Neocortical alpha-synuclein load was 
      significantly higher in cases with intermediate-to-high than in cases with 
      low-to-none AD-related pathology (p...=...0.007). We found two GBA variants (p.D140H 
      and p.E326K) in one patient and two heterozygous rare variants of unknown 
      significance in SORL1 in two patients. CONCLUSION: A high load of neocortical 
      alpha-synuclein pathology was present in most, but not all DLB cases. Additional 
      burden from presence of concomitant pathologies, synergistic effects and specific 
      genetic defects in the known disease-associated genes may have contributed to the 
      rapid disease progression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early onset dementias (EOD) are rare neurodegenerative dementias that 
      present before 65 years. Genetic factors have a substantially higher pathogenetic 
      contribution in EOD patients than in late onset dementia. OBJECTIVE: To identify 
      known and/or novel rare variants in major candidate genes associated to EOD by 
      high-throughput sequencing. Common-risk variants of apolipoprotein E (APOE) and 
      prion protein (PRNP) genes were also assessed. METHODS: We studied 22 EOD 
      patients recruited in Memory Clinics, in the context of studies investigating 
      genetic forms of dementia. Two methodological approaches were applied for the 
      target-Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis of these patients. In addition, 
      we performed progranulin plasma dosage, C9Orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion 
      analysis, and APOE genotyping. RESULTS: We detected three rare known pathogenic 
      mutations in the GRN and PSEN2 genes and eleven unknown-impact mutations in the 
      GRN, VCP, MAPT, FUS, TREM2, and NOTCH3 genes. Six patients were carriers of only 
      common risk variants (APOE and PRNP), and one did not show any risk 
      mutation/variant. Overall, 69% (n = 9) of our early onset Alzheimer's disease 
      (EAOD) patients, compared with 34% (n = 13) of sporadic late onset Alzheimer's 
      disease (LOAD) patients and 27% (n = 73) of non-affected controls (ADNI, whole 
      genome data), were carriers of at least two rare/common risk variants in the 
      analyzed candidate genes panel, excluding the full penetrant mutations. 
      CONCLUSION: This study suggests that EOD patients without full penetrant 
      mutations are characterized by higher probability to carry polygenic risk alleles 
      that patients with LOAD forms. This finding is in line with recently reported 
      evidence, thus suggesting that the genetic risk factors identified in LOAD might 
      modulate the risk also in EOAD.

AB  - Abnormal structural changes of the prion protein (PrP) are the cause of prion 
      disease in a wide range of mammals. However, spontaneous infected cases have not 
      been reported in chicken. Genetic variations of the prion protein gene (PRNP) may 
      impact susceptibility to prion disease but have not been investigated thus far. 
      Because an investigation of the chicken PRNP can improve the understanding of 
      characteristics related to resistance to prion disease, research on the chicken 
      PRNP is highly desirable. In this study, we investigated the genetic 
      characteristics of the chicken PRNP gene. For this, we performed direct 
      sequencing in 106 Dekalb White chickens and analyzed the genotype and allele 
      frequencies of chicken PRNP gene. We found two insertion and deletion 
      polymorphisms in the chicken PRNP: c.163_180delAACCCAGGGTACCCCCAT and 
      c.268_269insC. The former is a U2 hexapeptide deletion polymorphism. Of the 106 
      samples, 13 (12.26%) were insertion homozygotes, 89 (83.96%) were heterozygotes, 
      and 4 (3.77%) were deletion homozygotes in c.163_180delAACCCAGGGTACCCCCAT. In the 
      c.268_269insC polymorphism, 102 (96.23%) were deletion homozygotes, and 4 (3.77%) 
      were heterozygotes. Insertion homozygotes of c.268_269insC were not detected. Two 
      polymorphisms were in perfect linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a D' value of 1.0, 
      and three haplotypes were identified. Furthermore, PROVEAN evaluates 
      163_180delAACCCAGGGTACCCCCAT as 'deleterious' with a score of - 13.173. 
      Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the open reading frame 
      (ORF) of the PRNP gene were not found in the chicken. To the best of our 
      knowledge, this was the first report on the genetic variations of the chicken 
      PRNP gene.

AB  - Given the central role of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of common 
      neurodegenerative disorders, it is critical that mechanistic studies in human 
      tissue are interpreted in a genetically enlightened context. To address this, we 
      performed exome sequencing and copy number variant analysis on 1511 frozen human 
      brains with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 289), frontotemporal 
      dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD/ALS, n = 252), Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
      disease (CJD, n = 239), Parkinson's disease (PD, n = 39), dementia with Lewy 
      bodies (DLB, n = 58), other neurodegenerative, vascular, or neurogenetic 
      disorders (n = 266), and controls with no significant neuropathology (n = 368). 
      Genomic DNA was extracted from brain tissue in all cases before exome sequencing 
      (Illumina Nextera 62 Mb capture) with variants called by FreeBayes; copy number 
      variant (CNV) analysis (Illumina HumanOmniExpress-12 BeadChip); C9orf72 repeat 
      expansion detection; and APOE genotyping. Established or likely pathogenic 
      heterozygous, compound heterozygous, or homozygous variants, together with the 
      C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions and a copy number gain of APP, were 
      found in 61 brains. In addition to known risk alleles in 349 brains (23.9% of 
      1461 undergoing exome sequencing), we saw an association between rare variants in 
      GRN and DLB. Rare CNVs were found in <1.5% of brains, including copy number gains 
      of PRPH that were overrepresented in AD. Clinical, pathological, and genetic data 
      are available, enabling the retrieval of specific frozen brains through the UK 
      Medical Research Council Brain Banks Network. This allows direct access to 
      pathological and control human brain tissue based on an individual's genetic 
      architecture, thus enabling the functional validation of known genetic risk 
      factors and potentially pathogenic alleles identified in future studies.

TI  - Expanding the Spectrum of Genes Involved in Huntington Disease Using a Combined 
      Clinical and Genetic Approach.
PG  - 1105-14
LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2016.2215 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Huntington disease (HD), a prototypic monogenic disease, is caused by 
      an expanded CAG repeat in the HTT gene exceeding 35 units. However, not all 
      patients with an HD phenotype carry the pathological expansion in HTT, and the 
      positive diagnosis rate is poor. OBJECTIVES: To examine patients with HD 
      phenotypes to determine the frequency of HD phenocopies with typical features of 
      HD but without pathological CAG repeat expansions in HTT in an attempt to improve 
      the positive diagnosis rate. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between January 
      1, 2004, and April 18, 2011, a total of 226 consecutive index patients with an HD 
      phenotype were referred to specialized clinics of the French National Huntington 
      Disease Reference Centre for Rare Diseases. They underwent detailed clinical 
      examination and follow-up, as well as neuropsychological, biological, imaging, 
      and genetic examinations. Nucleotide expansions in JPH3, ATN1, TBP, and C9ORF72 
      and mutations in PRNP, as well as acquired conditions commonly causing HD 
      phenocopies, were first screened. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The diagnostic rate 
      of HD phenocopies and frequency of other etiologies using deep clinical 
      phenotyping and next generation sequencing. Our goal was to improve the genetic 
      diagnosis of HD phenocopies and to identify new HD related genes. RESULTS: One 
      hundred ninety-eight patients carried a pathological CAG repeat expansion in HTT, 
      whereas 28 patients (12 women and 16 men) did not. Huntington disease phenocopies 
      accounted for 12.4%, and their mean (SD) age at onset was similar to those of the 
      HD-HTT group (47.3 [12.7] years vs 50.3 [16.4] years, P = .29). We first 
      identified 3 patients with abnormal CTG expansions in JPH3, a fourth patient with 
      an antiphospholipid syndrome, and a fifth patient with B12 avitaminosis. A 
      custom-made 63-gene panel was generated based on clinical evolution and exome 
      sequencing. It contained genes responsible for HD phenocopies and other 
      neurodegenerative conditions, as well as candidate genes from exome sequencing in 
      3 index cases with imaging features of brain iron accumulation. We identified 
      mutations in genes associated with neurodegeneration, including CACNA1A (n = 2), 
      VPS13A (n = 1), UBQLN2 (n = 1), and VCP (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Huntington disease phenocopies without CAG repeat expansions in HTT are not rare, 
      occurring in 12.4% (28 of 226) herein, and should be considered in genetic 
      counseling. We used next-generation sequencing combined with clinical data and 
      disease evolution to explore multiple etiologies simultaneously. Our combined 
      clinical and genetic exploration of 28 HD phenocopies identified the underlying 
      cause in 35.7% (10 of 28). In conclusion, the etiologies of HD phenocopies are 
      heterogeneous, and clinical evolution should be taken into account when searching 
      for a genetic cause. The panel of candidate genes to be examined is larger than 
      expected but can be guided by specific imaging and clinical features. Other 
      neurodegenerative diseases with late onset in which variant segregation cannot be 
      verified could be productively explored with the combined approach illustrated 
      herein.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in chromosome 9 open reading frame 
      72 (C9ORF72) are causative for frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and motor neuron 
      disease (MND). Substantial phenotypic heterogeneity has been described in 
      patients with these expansions. We set out to identify genetic modifiers of 
      disease risk, age at onset, and survival after onset that may contribute to this 
      clinical variability. RESULTS: We examined a cohort of 330 C9ORF72 expansion 
      carriers and 374 controls. In these individuals, we assessed variants previously 
      implicated in FTD and/or MND; 36 variants were included in our analysis. After 
      adjustment for multiple testing, our analysis revealed three variants 
      significantly associated with age at onset (rs7018487 [UBAP1; p-value = 0.003], 
      rs6052771 [PRNP; p-value = 0.003], and rs7403881 [MT-Ie; p-value = 0.003]), and 
      six variants significantly associated with survival after onset (rs5848 [GRN; 
      p-value = 0.001], rs7403881 [MT-Ie; p-value = 0.001], rs13268953 [ELP3; p-value = 
      0.003], the epsilon 4 allele [APOE; p-value = 0.004], rs12608932 [UNC13A; p-value 
      = 0.003], and rs1800435 [ALAD; p-value = 0.003]). CONCLUSIONS: Variants 
      identified through this study were previously reported to be involved in FTD 
      and/or MND, but we are the first to describe their effects as potential disease 
      modifiers in the presence of a clear pathogenic mutation (i.e. C9ORF72 repeat 
      expansion). Although validation of our findings is necessary, these variants 
      highlight the importance of protein degradation, antioxidant defense and 
      RNA-processing pathways, and additionally, they are promising targets for the 
      development of therapeutic strategies and prognostic tests.

AB  - Identification of a specific genetic cause of early onset dementia (EOD) is 
      important but can be difficult because of pleiotropy, locus heterogeneity and 
      accessibility of gene tests. Here we assess the use of next generation sequencing 
      (NGS) technologies as a quick, accurate and cost effective method to determine 
      genetic diagnosis in EOD. We developed gene panel based technologies to assess 16 
      genes known to harbour mutations causal of dementia and combined these with PCR 
      based assessments of the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion and the 
      octapeptide repeat region of PRNP. In a blinded study of 95 samples we show very 
      high sensitivity and specificity are achievable using either Ion Torrent or MiSeq 
      sequencing platforms. Modifications to the gene panel permit accurate detection 
      of structural variation in APP. In 2/10 samples which had been selected because 
      they possess a variant of uncertain significance the new technology discovered a 
      causal mutation in genes not previously sequenced. A large proportion (23/85) of 
      samples showed genetic variants of uncertain significance in addition to known 
      mutations. The MRC Dementia Gene Panel and similar technologies are likely to be 
      transformational in EOD diagnosis with a significant impact on the proportion of 
      patients in whom a genetic cause is identified.

AB  - Point and octapeptide repeat (24 bp) insertional mutations in the prion protein 
      gene (PRNP) cause a dominantly transmitted dementia, associated with spongiform 
      degeneration of the brain, astrocytic gliosis and neuronal loss due to cell 
      accumulation of mutated protease resistant prion protein. The octapeptide repeat 
      region lies between codon 51 and 91, and comprises a nonapeptide followed by a 
      tandem repeat containing four copies of an octapeptide. The normal tandem length 
      in healthy individuals is five repeats R1-R2-R2-R3-R4, but mutations can contain 
      up to nine additional extra repeats. Some insight into this genetic mechanism 
      comes from the de novo meiotic insertional extra repeat mutation in PRNP we 
      detected in a patient whose parents had a normal phenotype and a wild-type 
      sequence in the same gene. To our knowledge, this is the first time this 
      condition has been described.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the features of neuropathology, abnormal prion protein 
      (PrP) molecules, and clinical data of a Chinese woman diagnosed with familiar 
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), having 7 octa-repeats inserted with codon 129 
      methionine homozygote in the PRNP gene. METHODS: Neuropathologic characteristics 
      of the brain were analyzed by hemotoxylin-eosin stain and electronic microscopy. 
      The presence of abnormal PrP in brains was detected by proteinase K and PrP 
      molecules were evaluated by deglycosylation assay. RESULTS: Spongiform 
      degeneration, with diffuse neuronal loss and mild astrocytic gliosis, as well as 
      with profound degeneration of neurons and astrocytes was observed. Proteinase 
      K-resistant PrP was deposited widely in various regions of the brain. Calculation 
      of the glycosylation ratios of proteinase K-resistant PrP molecules identified 
      that the monoglycosyl isomer was predominant. PrP deglycosylation tests allowed 
      for the identification of a predominant 19-kDa PrP signal that represents a 
      partially proteolytic C-terminal segment, a 27-kDa band that represents the 
      full-length wild-type PrP molecule, and a 30-kDa band that probably corresponds 
      to the full-length mutant PrP molecule. CONCLUSION: : Sporadic CJD-like 
      neuropathologic changes and deposits of proteinase K-resistant PrP have been 
      identified in this familiar CJD case with a 168 base pair nucleotide insertion. 
      The clinical features differ from previously reported cases that had 7 
      octa-repeat insertion, but bear similarities to sporadic CJD.

AB  - Genetic variability might contribute to species specificity of prion diseases in 
      various organisms. In this study, structures of the prion protein gene (PRNP) and 
      its amino acids were compared among species of which sequence data were 
      available. Comparisons of PRNP DNA sequences among 12 species including human, 
      chimpanzee, monkey, bovine, ovine, dog, mouse, rat, wallaby, opossum, chicken and 
      zebrafish allowed us to identify candidate regulatory regions in intron 1 and 
      3'-untranslated region (UTR) in addition to the coding region. Highly conserved 
      putative binding sites for transcription factors, such as heat shock factor 2 
      (HSF2) and myocite enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), were discovered in the intron 1. In 
      3'-UTR, the functional sequence (ATTAAA) for nucleus-specific polyadenylation was 
      found in all the analysed species. The functional sequence (TTTTTAT) for 
      maturation-specific polyadenylation was identically observed only in ovine, and 
      one or two nucleotide mismatches in the other species. A comparison of the amino 
      acid sequences in 53 species revealed a large sequence identity. Especially the 
      octapeptide repeat region was observed in all the species but frog and zebrafish. 
      Functional changes and susceptibility to prion diseases with various isoforms of 
      prion protein could be caused by numeric variability and conformational changes 
      discovered in the repeat sequences.

TI  - Prion protein insertional mutations increase aggregation propensity but not fiber 
      stability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mutations in the PRNP gene account for ~15% of all prion disease 
      cases. Little is understood about the mechanism of how some of these mutations in 
      PRNP cause the protein to aggregate into amyloid fibers or cause disease. We have 
      taken advantage of a chimeric protein system to study the oligopeptide repeat 
      domain (ORD) expansions of the prion protein, PrP, and their effect on protein 
      aggregation and amyloid fiber formation. We replaced the ORD of the yeast prion 
      protein Sup35p with that from wild type and expanded ORDs of PrP and compared 
      their biochemical properties in vitro. We previously determined that these 
      chimeric proteins maintain the [PSI+] yeast prion phenotype in vivo. 
      Interestingly, we noted that the repeat expanded chimeric prions seemed to be 
      able to maintain a stronger strain of [PSI+] and convert from [psi-] to [PSI+] 
      with a much higher frequency. In this study we have attempted to understand the 
      biochemical properties of these chimeric proteins and to establish a system to 
      study the properties of the ORD of PrP both in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: 
      Investigation of the chimeric proteins in vitro reveals that repeat-expansions 
      increase aggregation propensity and that the kinetics of fiber formation depends 
      on the number of repeats. The fiber formation reactions are promiscuous in that 
      the chimeric protein containing 14 repeats can readily cross-seed fiber formation 
      of proteins that have the wild type number of repeats. Morphologically, the 
      amyloid fibers formed by repeat-expanded proteins associate with each other to 
      form large clumps that were not as prevalent in fibers formed by proteins 
      containing the wild type number of repeats. Despite the increased aggregation 
      propensity and lateral association of the repeat expanded proteins, there was no 
      corresponding increase in the stability of the fibers formed. Therefore, we 
      predict that the differences in fibers formed with different repeat lengths may 
      not be due to gross changes in the amyloid core. CONCLUSION: The biochemical 
      observations presented here explain the properties of these chimeric proteins 
      previously observed in yeast. More importantly, they suggest a mechanism for the 
      observed correlation between age of onset and disease severity with respect to 
      the length of the ORD in humans.

TI  - Inherited prion disease with 5-OPRI: phenotype modification by repeat length and 
      codon 129.
PG  - 730-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human prion diseases have sporadic, acquired and inherited etiologies 
      and show considerable phenotypic heterogeneity. An individual inherited prion 
      disease offers an opportunity to study the determinants of this clinicopathologic 
      heterogeneity among individuals with the same causal mutation. METHODS: We report 
      clinical and pathologic data from three families with different 5-octapeptide 
      repeat insertion (5-OPRI) mutations of the prion protein gene (PRNP), extending 
      the reported phenotypic range of this mutation. RESULTS: The proband of a South 
      African family presented with a rapidly progressive dementia and atypical 
      pathology associated with kuru-like prion protein plaques. The original mutation 
      in this family probably occurred on a PRNP allele encoding a 1-octapeptide repeat 
      deletion polymorphism. This has not been previously reported as a precursor 
      allele in over 30 other OPRI mutation kindreds. An English family with a 
      genetically distinct mutation but identical protein product showed clinical 
      onsets that varied 30 years between father and daughter, an effect that may be 
      explained by their genotypes at PRNP codon 129. A patient from Northern Ireland 
      with a phenotype of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease presenting with visual 
      disturbance was unexpectedly found to have a 5-OPRI. CONCLUSIONS: When these 
      cases were combined with the existing world literature, the mean age at onset for 
      patients with 5-octapeptide repeat insertion (5-OPRI) was significantly later 
      than that for patients with 6-OPRI, but both mutations exhibit a similar powerful 
      disease modifying effect of PRNP codon 129.

TI  - Exclusion of mutations in the PRNP, JPH3, TBP, ATN1, CREBBP, POU3F2 and FTL genes 
      as a cause of disease in Portuguese patients with a Huntington-like phenotype.
PG  - 645-651
LID - 10.1007/s10038-006-0001-9 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterised by chorea, cognitive impairment, dementia and personality changes, 
      caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the HD gene. Often, patients with a 
      similar clinical presentation do not carry expansions of the CAG repeat in this 
      gene [Huntington disease-like (HDL) patients]. We report the genetic analysis of 
      107 Portuguese patients with an HDL phenotype. The HDL genes PRNP and JPH3, 
      encoding the prion protein and junctophilin-3, respectively, were screened for 
      repeat expansions in these patients. Given the partial clinical overlap of SCA17, 
      DRPLA and neuroferritinopathy with HD, their causative genes (TBP, ATN1, and FTL, 
      respectively) were also analysed. Finally, repeat expansions in two candidate 
      genes, CREBBP and POU3F2, which encode the nuclear transcriptional coactivator 
      CREB-binding protein and the CNS-specific transcription factor N-Oct-3, 
      respectively, were also studied. Expansions of the repetitive tracts of the PRNP, 
      JPH3, TBP, ATN1, CREBBP and POU3F2 genes were excluded in all patients, as were 
      sequence alterations in the FTL gene. Since none of the genes already included in 
      the differential diagnosis of HD was responsible for the disease in our sample, 
      the genetic heterogeneity of the HDL phenotype is still open for investigation.

TI  - Meta-analysis of gross insertions causing human genetic disease: novel mutational 
      mechanisms and the role of replication slippage.
PG  - 207-21
AB  - Although gross insertions (>20 bp) comprise <1% of disease-causing mutations, 
      they nevertheless represent an important category of pathological lesion. In an 
      attempt to study these insertions in a systematic way, 158 gross insertions 
      ranging in size between 21 bp and approximately 10 kb were identified using the 
      Human Gene Mutation Database (www.hgmd.org). A careful meta-analytical study 
      revealed extensive diversity in terms of the nature of the inserted DNA sequence 
      and has provided new insights into the underlying mutational mechanisms. Some 70% 
      of gross insertions were found to represent sequence duplications of different 
      types (tandem, partial tandem, or complex). Although most of the tandem 
      duplications were explicable by simple replication slippage, the three complex 
      duplications appear to result from multiple slippage events. Some 11% of gross 
      insertions were attributable to nonpolyglutamine repeat expansions (including 
      octapeptide repeat expansions in the prion protein gene [PRNP] and polyalanine 
      tract expansions) and evidence is presented to support the contention that these 
      mutations are also caused by replication slippage rather than by unequal crossing 
      over. Some 17% of gross insertions, all >or=276 bp in length, were found to be 
      due to LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition involving different types of element (L1 
      trans-driven Alu, L1 direct, and L1 trans-driven SVA). A second example of 
      pathological mitochondrial-nuclear sequence transfer was identified in the USH1C 
      gene but appears to arise via a novel mechanism, trans-replication slippage. 
      Finally, evidence for another novel mechanism of human genetic disease, involving 
      the possible capture of DNA oligonucleotides, is presented in the context of a 
      26-bp insertion into the ERCC6 gene.

TI  - A processed pseudogene contributes to apparent mule deer prion gene 
      heterogeneity.
PG  - 167-73
AB  - Pathogenesis and transmission of the prion disorders (transmissible spongiform 
      encephalopathies, TSEs) are mediated by a modified isoform of the prion protein 
      (PrP). Prion protein gene (PRNP) alleles associated with relative susceptibility 
      to TSE have been identified in sheep, humans and possibly elk. Comparable data 
      have not been derived for mule deer, a species susceptible to the TSE chronic 
      wasting disease (CWD). Initial analysis of the open reading frame (ORF) in exon 3 
      of the mule deer PRNP gene revealed polymorphisms in all 145 samples analyzed, 
      with 10 potential polymorphic sites. Because 144/145 (99.3%) of the samples were 
      heterozygous for a coding change (N/S) at codon 138 (bp 412) and a non-coding 
      polymorphism at bp 418, and individual deer with three or four different alleles 
      were identified a possible gene duplication was indicated. Analysis of BAC clones 
      containing mule deer PRNP genes revealed a full length functional gene and a 
      processed pseudogene. The pseudogene was characteristic of previously described 
      retroelements, in that it lacks introns and is flanked by repeat sequences. Three 
      alleles of the functional gene were identified, with coding changes only at 
      codons 20 (D/G) and 225 (S/F). Determination of PRNP functional gene alleles from 
      47 CWD-positive mule deer showed the predominant allele encoded 20D225S 
      (frequency 0.85). When alleles were grouped by coding changes in the functional 
      gene, four of the six possible peptide combinations were identified in infected 
      deer. Three pseudogene alleles with coding changes in exon 3 were identified in 
      the mule deer samples examined. Because the TSEs appear to be "protein only" 
      disorders, the presence of an untranslated pseudogene is not expected to affect 
      disease resistance. Therefore, selection of a genotyping method specific for the 
      functional gene is critical for large-scale studies to identify the role of the 
      PRNP gene in susceptibility to CWD in mule deer.

TI  - Huntington's disease-like phenotype due to trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 
      TBP and JPH3 genes.
PG  - 1599-603
AB  - We report a group of 252 patients with a Huntington's disease-like (HDL) 
      phenotype, including 60 with typical Huntington's disease, who had tested 
      negative for pathological expansions in the IT15 gene, the major mutation in 
      Huntington's disease. They were screened for repeat expansions in two other genes 
      involved in HDL phenotypes: those encoding the junctophilin-3 (JPH3/HDL2) and 
      prion (PRNP/HDL1) proteins. In addition, because of the clinical overlap between 
      patients with HDL disease and autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia or 
      dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), we investigated trinucleotide 
      repeat expansions in genes encoding the TATA-binding protein (TBP/SCA17) and 
      atrophin-1 (DRPLA). Two patients carried 43 and 50 uninterrupted CTG repeats in 
      the JPH3 gene. Two other patients had 44 and 46 CAA/CAG repeats in the TBP gene. 
      Patients with expansions in the TBP or JPH3 genes had HDL phenotypes 
      indistinguishable from Huntington's disease. Taking into account patients with 
      typical Huntington's disease, their frequencies were evaluated as 3% each in our 
      series of typical HDL patients. Interestingly, incomplete penetrance of the 46 
      CAA/CAG repeat in the TBP gene was observed in a 59-year-old transmitting, but 
      healthy, parent. Furthermore, we report a new configuration of the expanded TBP 
      allele, with 11 repeats on the first polymorphic stretch of CAGs. Expansions in 
      the DRPLA gene and insertions in the PRNP gene were not found in our group of 
      patients. Further genetic heterogeneity of the HDL phenotype therefore exists.

TI  - Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease associated with a deletion of two repeats in the prion 
      protein gene.
PG  - 1628-30
AB  - A two-octapeptide repeat deletion of the prion protein gene has been recently 
      observed in a patient with a 2-year history of dementia and a clinical diagnosis 
      of possible Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The authors report a similar 
      deletion in a patient with a definitive diagnosis of CJD. Since the two-repeat 
      deletion has not been observed in large, population-based studies, the two cases 
      suggest that this deletion is a new pathogenic mutation associated with CJD.

TI  - Huntington disease phenocopy is a familial prion disease.
PG  - 1385-8
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a common autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease 
      with early adult-onset motor abnormalities and dementia. Many studies of HD show 
      that huntingtin (CAG)n repeat-expansion length is a sensitive and specific marker 
      for HD. However, there are a significant number of examples of HD in the absence 
      of a huntingtin (CAG)n expansion, suggesting that mutations in other genes can 
      provoke HD-like disorders. The identification of genes responsible for these 
      "phenocopies" may greatly improve the reliability of genetic screens for HD and 
      may provide further insight into neurodegenerative disease. We have examined an 
      HD phenocopy pedigree with linkage to chromosome 20p12 for mutations in the prion 
      protein (PrP) gene (PRNP). This reveals that affected individuals are 
      heterozygous for a 192-nucleotide (nt) insertion within the PrP coding region, 
      which encodes an expanded PrP with eight extra octapeptide repeats. This reveals 
      that this HD phenocopy is, in fact, a familial prion disease and that PrP 
      repeat-expansion mutations can provoke an HD "genocopy." PrP repeat expansions 
      are well characterized and provoke early-onset, slowly progressive atypical prion 
      diseases with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and a remarkable range 
      of clinical features, many of which overlap with those of HD. This observation 
      raises the possibility that an unknown number of HD phenocopies are, in fact, 
      familial prion diseases and argues that clinicians should consider screening for 
      PrP mutations in individuals with HD-like diseases in which the characteristic HD 
      (CAG)n repeat expansions are absent.

TI  - Internal repeats of prion protein and A beta PP, and reciprocal similarity with 
      the amyloid-related proteins.
PG  - 250-5
AB  - We are currently interested in a group of proteins associated with the dementias 
      characterized by amyloid deposition in the brain: amyloid beta protein precursor 
      (A beta PP) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the abnormal isoform of prion protein 
      (PrP) of spongiform encephalopathies such as kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease 
      (CJD) and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSSD). Here we show that both A 
      beta PP and prion protein (PrP) consist of peculiar internal repeats and share 
      regions of sequence similarity. Further analysis revealed that local homology is 
      also shared with the other proteins involved in specific forms of 
      amyloidosis--i.e., the amyloid related proteins (ARP).

TI  - APOE in non-Alzheimer amyloidoses: transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
PG  - 548-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: The APOE genotype has been shown to influence the risk of developing 
      sporadic and familial AD. This effect is isoform-dependent, the APOE epsilon4 
      allele increasing susceptibility and the APOE epsilon2 allele providing 
      protection. Amyloid formation is an important part of the pathogenesis in AD as 
      well as in spongiform encephalopathies; apoE deposition in amyloid plaques has 
      been documented in both conditions. METHODS: We examined the frequency of the 
      APOE alleles in patients with various forms of transmissible spongiform 
      encephalopathies, or prion diseases, including sporadic and iatrogenic 
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease associated with 
      PRNP 178N/129V and 200K/129M point mutations and a 24-nucleotide repeat 
      expansion; fatal familial insomnia caused by the 178N/129M mutation; 
      Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease associated with 102L/129M mutation; and 
      kuru. RESULTS: None of the groups we studied had a significant excess of APOE 
      epsilon4 allele when compared with appropriate controls. CONCLUSION: Our results 
      do not support the contention that the APOE epsilon4 allele is a risk factor for 
      developing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or related disorders.

TI  - Abnormal properties of prion protein with insertional mutations in different cell 
      types.
PG  - 11980-5
AB  - Inherited forms of the human transmissible spongiform encephalopathy 
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) have been associated with mutations in the normal 
      soluble, protease-sensitive form of the host prion protein (PrP-sen). Normal PrP 
      protein contains five copies of a repeating eight-amino acid region, and PrP 
      molecules with six or more copies of this region are associated with disease in 
      familial CJD. It has been hypothesized that these mutations might facilitate 
      spontaneous formation of the abnormal, aggregated protease-resistant PrP isoform, 
      PrP-res, associated with clinical CJD and other transmissible spongiform 
      encephalopathies (TSE). In the present experiments, hamster PrP molecules with 5 
      (wild-type), 7, 9, or 11 copies of this repeat region were generated and 
      expressed in mouse fibroblast cells or mouse neuroblastoma cells. In mouse 
      fibroblast cells, mutant hamster PrP molecules expressing 7, 9, and 11 copies of 
      the octapeptide repeat sequence showed altered cell surface expression, but both 
      mutant and wild-type hamster PrP-sen molecules demonstrated abnormal properties 
      of aggregation and increased protease resistance. By contrast in mouse 
      neuroblastoma cells, hamster PrP-sen with 5, 9, and 11 octapeptide repeats were 
      expressed normally on the cell surface, but only PrP-sen molecules with 9 or 11 
      copies of the repeat motif had abnormal properties of aggregation and increased 
      protease resistance. Overall, regardless of cell type, hamster PrP molecules with 
      greater than 7 octapeptide repeats were more aggregated and more 
      protease-resistant than molecules with 7 repeats or less. However, these abnormal 
      molecules were at least 1000-fold less protease-resistant than bona fide PrP-res 
      derived from TSE-infected brain tissue, and they showed no increased ability to 
      form PrP-res in a cell-free system.

TI  - Evidence that homologous ssDNA is present in scrapie, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, 
      and bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
PG  - 314-26
AB  - Homogenized brain tissue from scrapie-infected hamsters and uninfected hamsters 
      was subjected to sub-cellular fractionation to isolate nemavirus. Nucleic acid 
      was extracted from these fractions, which also contained mitochondria. 
      Agarose-gel electrophoresis revealed a band corresponding to the size of circular 
      hamster mtDNA in both infected and uninfected samples, but slower migrating bands 
      were observed only in samples from scrapie-infected brain. A single band of ssDNA 
      corresponding to about 1.2 kb was purified by alkaline gel electrophoresis from 
      the nucleic acid content of the enriched preparations of nemavirus. The ssDNA was 
      synthesized into double-stranded DNA, cloned and sequenced. An unusual 
      palindromic six base TACGTA repeat sequence was observed suggesting that 1.2 kb 
      molecules consist of multiple copies of (TACGTA)n spaced along the length of the 
      ssDNA with a preceding sequence TATATA. The comparison of the nucleotide sequence 
      of the inserted DNA to the GenBank nucleotide database revealed no significant 
      homology to other sequences. A probe prepared from the Nar 50 clone was 
      hybridized against DNA prepared from scrapie, CJD, BSE and normal brains under 
      various salt and temperature conditions. The probe reacted with a band of about 
      1.2 kb in scrapie, CJD and BSE but not with control normal DNA specimens, thereby 
      confirming the presence of ssDNA in these SEs. The results suggest an intimate 
      association between the presence of nemavirus particles and scrapie, CJD and BSE.

TI  - Transmissible familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease associated with five, seven, and 
      eight extra octapeptide coding repeats in the PRNP gene.
PG  - 10926-30
AB  - The PRNP gene, encoding the amyloid precursor protein that is centrally involved 
      in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), has an unstable region of five variant tandem 
      octapeptide coding repeats between codons 51 and 91. We screened a total of 535 
      individuals for the presence of extra repeats in this region, including patients 
      with sporadic and familial forms of spongiform encephalopathy, members of their 
      families, other neurological and non-neurological patients, and normal controls. 
      We identified three CJD families (in each of which the proband's disease was 
      neuropathologically confirmed and experimentally transmitted to primates) that 
      were heterozygous for alleles with 10, 12, or 13 repeats, some of which had 
      "wobble" nucleotide substitutions. We also found one individual with 9 repeats 
      and no nucleotide substitutions who had no evidence of neurological disease. 
      These observations, together with data on published British patients with 11 and 
      14 repeats, strongly suggest that the occurrence of 10 or more octapeptide 
      repeats in the encoded amyloid precursor protein predisposes to CJD.
