AB  - BACKGROUND: The term rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) with Lewy bodies (rpDLB) 
      is used for DLB patients who develop a rapidly progressive neurological syndrome 
      and have reduced survival. Here, we characterise the clinical, neuropathological, 
      and molecular characteristics of a large rpDLB neuropathological series. METHODS: 
      We included all RPD patients with a disease duration < 4 years submitted to our 
      prion disease referral centre between 2003 and 2022 who showed Lewy body 
      pathology (LBP) in limbic or neocortical stages as primary neuropathological 
      diagnosis, had no systemic condition justifying the rapid deterioration and were 
      previously neurologically unimpaired. Clinical features were retrieved and 
      compared with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and rapidly progressive Alzheimer's 
      disease (rpAD) cohorts. Neuropathological and genetic (whole exome sequencing, 
      APOE genotyping, and C9orf72 repeat expansion analysis) characteristics of rpDLB 
      patients were systematically investigated. We scored semi-quantitatively the LBP 
      load and performed a alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn) RT-QuIC seeding amplification assay (SAA) 
      on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and tenfold serially diluted brain homogenates from 
      different brain areas in rpDLB patients and typical long-lasting Lewy body 
      disease (LBD) with dementia patients as control group. RESULTS: RpDLB patients 
      were older (p = 0.047) and presented more cognitive fluctuations (p = 0.005), 
      visual hallucinations (p = 0.020), neuropsychiatric symptoms (p = 0.006) and 
      seizures (p = 0.032), and fewer cerebellar (p < 0.001) and visual (p = 0.004) 
      signs than CJD ones. Delirium onset was more common than in both CJD (p < 0.001) 
      and rpAD (p = 0.008). Atypical LBD signs (pyramidal, myoclonus, akinetic mutism) 
      were common. All tested patients were positive by CSF alphaSyn SAA. Concomitant 
      pathologies were common, with only four cases showing relatively "pure" LBP. LBP 
      load and alphaSyn seeding activity measured through alphaSyn RT-QuIC SAA were not 
      significantly different between rpDLB patients and typical LBD. We found a likely 
      pathogenic variant in GBA in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that: 
      1) rpDLB exhibits a distinct clinical signature (2) CSF alphaSyn SAA is a reliable 
      diagnostic test; 3) rpDLB is a heterogeneous neuropathological entity that can be 
      underlain by both widespread pure LBP, or multiple copathologies 4) rpDLB is 
      likely not sustained by distinct alphaSyn conformational strains; 5) genetic defects 
      may, at least occasionally, contribute to the poor prognosis in these patients.

TI  - DNA Aptamer Binding Octapeptide Repeat Region of Cellular Prion Protein.
PG  - 18595-18602
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.3c04557 [doi]
AB  - Cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) is highly expressed in a variety of tumor cells 
      and plays a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases. Its N-terminal domain 
      contains a conserved octapeptide (PHGGGWGQ) repeat sequence. The number of 
      repeats has been correlated with the species as well as the development of 
      associated diseases. Herein, PrP(C) was identified to be the molecular target of 
      a high-affinity DNA aptamer HA5-68 obtained by cell-SELEX. Aptamer HA5-68 was 
      further optimized to two short sequences (HA5-40-1 and HA5-40-2), and its binding 
      site to PrP(C) was identified to be located in the loop-stem-loop region of the 
      head of its secondary structure. HA5 series aptamers were demonstrated to bind 
      the octapeptide repeat region of PrP(C), as well as the synthesized peptides 
      containing different numbers of octapeptide repeats. The PrP(C) expression on 42 
      cell lines was measured by using aptamer HA5-68 as a molecular probe. The clear 
      understanding of the molecular structure and binding mechanism of this set of 
      aptamers will provide information for the design of diagnostic methods and 
      therapeutic drugs targeting PrP(C).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To perform a screening for Huntington disease (HD) phenocopies in a 
      Swedish cohort. METHODS: Seventy-three DNA samples negative for HD were assessed 
      at a tertiary center in Stockholm. The screening included analyses for 
      C9orf72-frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9orf72-FTD/ALS), 
      octapeptide repeat insertions (OPRIs) in PRNP associated with inherited prion 
      diseases (IPD), Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2), spinocerebellar ataxia-2 
      (SCA2), spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) and spinocerebellar ataxia-17 (SCA17). 
      Targeted genetic analysis was carried out in two cases based on the salient 
      phenotypic features. RESULTS: The screening identified two patients with SCA17, 
      one patient with IPD associated with 5-OPRI but none with nucleotide expansions 
      in C9orf72 or for HDL2, SCA2 or SCA3. Furthermore, SGCE-myoclonic-dystonia 11 
      (SGCE-M-D) and benign hereditary chorea (BHC) was diagnosed in two sporadic 
      cases. WES identified VUS in STUB1 in two patients with predominant cerebellar 
      ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in keeping with previous screenings and 
      suggest that other genes yet to be discovered are involved in the etiology of HD 
      phenocopies.

TI  - The manifold role of octapeptide repeats in prion protein assembly.
LID - e24303 [pii]
LID - 10.1002/pep2.24303 [doi]
AB  - Prion protein misfolding is associated with fatal neurodegenerative disorders 
      such as kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and several animal encephalopathies. 
      While the C-terminal 106-126 peptide has been well studied for its role in prion 
      replication and toxicity, the octapeptide repeat (OPR) sequence found within the 
      N-terminal domain has been relatively under explored. Recent findings that the 
      OPR has both local and long-range effects on prion protein folding and assembly, 
      as well as its ability to bind and regulate transition metal homeostasis, 
      highlights the important role this understudied region may have in prion 
      pathologies. This review attempts to collate this knowledge to advance a deeper 
      understanding on the varied physiologic and pathologic roles the prion OPR plays, 
      and connect these findings to potential therapeutic modalities focused on 
      OPR-metal binding. Continued study of the OPR will not only elucidate a more 
      complete mechanistic model of prion pathology, but may enhance knowledge on other 
      neurodegenerative processes underlying Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's 
      diseases.

AB  - The N-terminus of the PRNP gene normally contains a 5-octapeptide repeat 
      (R1-R2-R2-R3-R4), and insertions at this locus can cause hereditary prion 
      diseases. In the present study, we found a 5-octapeptide repeat insertion 
      (5-OPRI) in a sibling case of frontotemporal dementia. Consistent with previous 
      literature, 5-OPRI rarely met the diagnostic criteria for Creutzfeldt...Jakob 
      disease (CJD). We propose 5-OPRI as a suspected causative mutation for 
      early-onset dementia, especially the frontotemporal type.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are reports of different clinical statuses in carriers of 
      intermediate alleles (IAs) of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the HTT gene, from 
      individuals affected by a clinical picture indistinguishable from Huntington's 
      disease (HD) to those without manifestations. Therefore, the possible clinical 
      significance of these alleles has been widely debated. OBJECTIVES: The aim of 
      this study was to describe general and clinical features and discard HD 
      phenocopies by molecular assessment in a case series of IA carriers on the HTT 
      gene of a laboratory sample from a neurological center in Mexico. METHODS: We 
      selected individuals who had previously been tested for the HTT gene expansion, 
      which resulted in IAs. Clinical information was obtained from medical records, 
      and molecular analysis of the JPH3, PRNP, and TBP genes was performed only in IA 
      carriers with clinical manifestations. In addition, two patients with IA and 
      acanthocytes were evaluated by whole-exome sequencing. The scientific and ethical 
      committees of the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery Manuel Velasco 
      Suarez (NINNMVS) approved this study. RESULTS: From 1994 to 2019, the Genetics 
      Department of the NINNMVS confirmed 34 individuals with IAs, 15 of whom belonged 
      to 11 families with HD (IA-HD) and 19 of whom had no family history of HD 
      (IA-non-HD). We found a high proportion of manifestations of the HD phenotypic 
      spectrum in the IA-non-HD subgroup. In addition, among the 20 samples of IA 
      carriers with manifestations molecularly evaluated, we identified two unrelated 
      subjects with CAG/CTG repeat expansions on the JPH3 gene, confirming HD-like 2 
      (HDL2), and one patient with the homozygous pathogenic c.3232G>T variant 
      (p.Glu1078Ter) in the VPS13A gene, demonstrating choreoacanthocytosis. 
      DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Our results show the most extensive series of subjects 
      with IAs and clinical manifestations. In addition, we identify three HD 
      phenocopies, two HDL2 cases, and one choreoacanthocytosis case. Therefore, we 
      emphasize evaluating other HD phenocopies in IA carriers with clinical 
      manifestations whose family background is not associated with HD.

AB  - Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) also known as prion diseases, 
      are fatal neurodegenerative diseases. Prion diseases are caused by abnormal prion 
      protein (PrP(Sc)) derived from normal prion protein (PrP(C)), which is encoded by 
      the prion protein gene (PRNP). Prion diseases have been reported in several 
      mammals. Notably, chickens, one species of bird, have not been reported to 
      develop prion diseases and showed resistance to bovine spongiform encephalopathy 
      (BSE) infection. However, genetic polymorphisms of the PRNP gene and protein 
      structure of the prion protein (PrP) related to vulnerability to prion diseases 
      have not been investigated in pheasants, another species of bird. We performed 
      amplicon sequencing of the pheasant PRNP gene to identify genetic polymorphisms 
      in 148 pheasants. We analyzed the genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies of 
      the pheasant PRNP polymorphisms. In addition, we evaluated the effect of genetic 
      polymorphisms of the pheasant PRNP gene on pheasant PrP by the AMYCO, PROVEAN, 
      PolyPhen-2 and PANTHER softwares. Furthermore, we compared the amino acid 
      sequences of tandem repeat domains and secondary and tertiary structures of prion 
      proteins (PrPs) among several animals. Finally, we investigated the impact of 
      non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on hydrogen bonds and 
      tertiary structures of pheasant PrP by Swiss PDB viewer software. We identified 
      34 novel genetic polymorphisms of the pheasant PRNP gene including 8 
      non-synonymous SNPs and 6 insertion/deletion polymorphisms. Among the 
      non-synonymous SNPs, the L23F, G33C and R177Q SNPs showed that they could have a 
      deleterious effect on pheasant PrP. In addition, the R177Q SNP was predicted to 
      show an increase in amyloid propensity and a reduction in hydrogen bonds of 
      pheasant PrP. Among the insertion/deletion polymorphisms, 
      c.163_180delAACCCGGGGTATCCCCAC showed that it could have a detrimental effect on 
      pheasant PrP. Furthermore, secondary and tertiary structures of pheasant PrP were 
      predicted to have structures similar to those of chicken PrP. To the best of our 
      knowledge, this is the first study on genetic polymorphisms of the pheasant PRNP 
      gene.

TI  - Genetic landscape of early-onset dementia in Hungary.
PG  - 5289-5300
LID - 10.1007/s10072-022-06168-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early-onset dementias (EOD) are predominantly genetically 
      determined, but the underlying disease-causing alterations are often unknown. The 
      most frequent forms of EODs are early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and 
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD). PATIENTS: This study included 120 Hungarian 
      patients with EOD (48 familial and 72 sporadic) which had a diagnosis of EOAD 
      (n = 49), FTD (n = 49), or atypical dementia (n = 22). RESULTS: Monogenic 
      dementia was detected in 15.8% of the patients. A pathogenic hexanucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene was present in 6.7% of cases and 
      disease-causing variants were detected in other known AD or FTD genes in 6.7% of 
      cases (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, GRN). A compound heterozygous alteration of the TREM2 
      gene was identified in one patient and heterozygous damaging variants in the 
      CSF1R and PRNP genes were detected in two other cases. In two patients, the 
      coexistence of several heterozygous damaging rare variants associated with 
      neurodegeneration was detected (1.7%). The APOE genotype had a high odds ratio 
      for both the APOE varepsilon4/3 and the varepsilon4/4 genotype (OR = 2.7 (95%CI = 1.3-5.9) and 
      OR = 6.5 (95%CI = 1.4-29.2), respectively). In TREM2, SORL1, and ABCA7 genes, 5 
      different rare damaging variants were detected as genetic risk factors. These 
      alterations were not present in the control group. CONCLUSION: Based on our 
      observations, a comprehensive, targeted panel of next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
      testing investigating several neurodegeneration-associated genes may accelerate 
      the path to achieve the proper genetic diagnosis since phenotypes are present on 
      a spectrum. This can also reveal hidden correlations and overlaps in 
      neurodegenerative diseases that would remain concealed in separated genetic 
      testing.

AB  - Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative conditions that affect humans and 
      animals. Rapid and accurate sequencing of the prion gene PRNP is paramount to 
      human prion disease diagnosis and for animal surveillance programmes. Current 
      methods for PRNP genotyping involve sequencing of small fragments within the 
      protein-coding region. The contribution of variants in the non-coding regions of 
      PRNP including large structural changes is poorly understood. Here, we used 
      long-range PCR and Nanopore sequencing to sequence the full length of PRNP, 
      including its regulatory region, in 25 samples from blood and brain of 
      individuals with inherited or sporadic prion diseases. Nanopore sequencing 
      detected the same variants as identified by Sanger sequencing, including repeat 
      expansions/deletions. Nanopore identified additional single-nucleotide variants 
      in the non-coding regions of PRNP, but no novel structural variants were 
      discovered. Finally, we explored somatic mosaicism of PRNP's octapeptide repeat 
      region, which is a hypothetical cause of sporadic prion disease. While we found 
      changes consistent with somatic mutations, we demonstrate that they may have been 
      generated by the PCR. Our study illustrates the accuracy of Nanopore sequencing 
      for rapid and field prion disease diagnosis and highlights the need for 
      single-molecule sequencing methods for the detection of somatic mutations.

TI  - Production of Autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma for Boosting In Vitro Human 
      Fibroblast Expansion.
LID - 10.3791/60816 [doi]
AB  - There is currently great clinical interest in the use of autologous fibroblasts 
      for skin repair. In most cases, culture of skin cells in vitro is required. 
      However, cell culture using xenogenic or allogenic culture media has some 
      disadvantages (i.e., risk of infectious agent transmission or slow cell 
      expansion). Here, an autologous culture system is developed for the expansion of 
      human skin fibroblast cells in vitro using a patient's own platelet-rich plasma 
      (PRP). Human dermal fibroblasts are isolated from the patient while undergoing 
      abdominoplasty. Cultures are followed for up to 7 days using a medium 
      supplemented with either fetal bovine serum (FBS) or PRP. Blood cell content in 
      PRP preparations, proliferation, and fibroblast differentiation are assessed. 
      This protocol describes the method for obtaining a standardized, non-activated 
      preparation of PRP using a dedicated medical device. The preparation requires 
      only a medical device (CuteCell-PRP) and centrifuge. This device is suitable 
      under sufficient medical practice conditions and is a one-step, apyrogenic, and 
      sterile closed system that requires a single, soft spin centrifugation of 1,500 x 
      g for 5 min. After centrifugation, the blood components are separated, and the 
      platelet-rich plasma is easily collected. This device allows a quick, consistent, 
      and standardized preparation of PRP that can be used as a cell culture supplement 
      for in vitro expansion of human cells. The PRP obtained here contains a 1.5-fold 
      platelet concentration compared to whole blood together, with a preferential 
      removal of red and white blood cells. It is shown that PRP presents a boosting 
      effect in cell proliferation compared to FBS (7.7x) and that fibroblasts are 
      activated upon PRP treatment.

TI  - The Effect of Octapeptide Repeats on Prion Folding and Misfolding.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22041800 [doi]
LID - 1800
AB  - Misfolding of prion protein (PrP) into amyloid aggregates is the central feature 
      of prion diseases. PrP has an amyloidogenic C-terminal domain with three 
      alpha-helices and a flexible tail in the N-terminal domain in which multiple 
      octapeptide repeats are present in most mammals. The role of the octapeptides in 
      prion diseases has previously been underestimated because the octapeptides are 
      not located in the amyloidogenic domain. Correlation between the number of 
      octapeptide repeats and age of onset suggests the critical role of octapeptide 
      repeats in prion diseases. In this study, we have investigated four PrP variants 
      without any octapeptides and with 1, 5 and 8 octapeptide repeats. From the 
      comparison of the protein structure and the thermal stability of these proteins, 
      as well as the characterization of amyloids converted from these PrP variants, we 
      found that octapeptide repeats affect both folding and misfolding of PrP creating 
      amyloid fibrils with distinct structures. Deletion of octapeptides forms fewer 
      twisted fibrils and weakens the cytotoxicity. Insertion of octapeptides enhances 
      the formation of typical silk-like fibrils but it does not increase the 
      cytotoxicity. There might be some threshold effect and increasing the number of 
      peptides beyond a certain limit has no further effect on the cell viability, 
      though the reasons are unclear at this stage. Overall, the results of this study 
      elucidate the molecular mechanism of octapeptides at the onset of prion diseases.

TI  - Co-incidental C9orf72 expansion mutation-related frontotemporal lobar 
      degeneration pathology and sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
PG  - 1009-1015
LID - 10.1111/ene.14621 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansion mutation is the most common 
      cause of genetic frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (ALS) and combined FTD-ALS. Its underlying neuropathology combines TDP-43 
      pathology and dipeptide repeat protein (DPR) deposits and may also associate with 
      other neurodegeneration-associated protein aggregates. Herein we present a unique 
      combination of C9orf72 mutation with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in 
      a 74-year-old patient with rapidly progressive dementia. METHODS: Detailed 
      neuropathological examination including immunohistochemistry for several 
      proteinopathies. Genetic analysis was conducted by repeat primed polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR). Furthermore, we analyzed additional C9orf72 mutation carriers for 
      prion-protein (PrP) deposits in brain tissue and screened the cerebellar cortex 
      of other CJD cases for p62/DPR neuronal inclusions to assess the frequency of 
      combined pathologies. RESULTS: Postmortem brain examination of a patient with a 
      rapidly progressive neurological deterioration of 8 months' duration confirmed 
      the diagnosis of CJD. She harbored valine homozygosity at PRNP codon 129. In 
      addition, a frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)-pattern with TDP-43 protein 
      aggregates and p62+/C9RANT+ positive inclusions along with a high degree of 
      Alzheimer-related pathology (A3B3C3) were identified. The suspected C9orf72 
      expansion mutation was confirmed by repeat-primed PCR. Screening of 13 C9orf72 
      cases showed no pathological PrP aggregates and screening of 100 CJD cases 
      revealed no other C9orf72 expansion mutation carriers. CONCLUSION: A combination 
      of a C9orf72 expansion mutation-related FTLD with sporadic CJD in the same 
      patient is rare. While the rarity of both diseases makes this concurrence most 
      likely to be coincidental, questions regarding a potential link between these two 
      neurodegenerative pathologies deserve further studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prion diseases are zoonotic diseases with a broad infection spectrum 
      among mammalian hosts and are caused by the misfolded prion protein (PrP(Sc)) 
      derived from the normal prion protein (PrP(C)), which encodes the prion protein 
      gene (PRNP). Currently, although several prion disease-resistant animals have 
      been reported, a high dose of prion agent inoculation triggers prion disease 
      infection in these disease-resistant animals. However, in chickens, natural prion 
      disease-infected cases have not been reported, and experimental challenges with 
      prion agents have failed to cause infection. Unlike other prion disease-resistant 
      animals, chickens have shown perfect resistance to prion disease thus far. Thus, 
      investigation of the chicken PRNP gene could improve for understanding the 
      mechanism of perfect prion-disease resistance. Here, we investigated the genetic 
      characteristics of the open reading frame (ORF) of the chicken PRNP gene in a 
      large sampling of various chicken breeds. RESULTS: We found only tandem repeat 
      deletion polymorphisms of the chicken PRNP ORF in the 4 chicken breeds including 
      106 Dekalb White, 100 Ross, 98 Ogolgye and 100 Korean native chickens. In 
      addition, the distribution of chicken insertion/deletion polymorphisms was 
      significantly different among the 4 chicken breeds. Finally, we found significant 
      differences in the number of PRNP SNPs between prion disease-susceptible species 
      and prion disease-resistant species. Notably, chickens lack SNPs in the ORF of 
      the prion protein. CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that the absence of SNPs 
      in the chicken PRNP ORF is a notable feature of animals with perfect resistant to 
      prion disease.

PG  - 443-448
LID - 10.18502/ijrm.v17i6.4816 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adequate endometrial growth is principal for implantation and 
      pregnancy. Thin endometrium is associated with lower pregnancy rate in assisted 
      reproductive technology. Some frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles are cancelled 
      due to inadequate endometrial growth. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of 
      autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) intrauterine infusion for the treatment of 
      thin endometrium. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 72 patients who had a history 
      of cancelled frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycle due to the thin endometrium ( 
       <  7mm) were assessed for the eligibility to enter the study between 2016 and 
      2017. Twelve patients were excluded for different reasons, and 60 included 
      patients were randomly assigned to PRP or sham-catheter groups in a double-blind 
      manner. Hormone replacement therapy was administered for endometrial preparation 
      in all participants. PRP intrauterine infusion or shamcatheter was performed on 
      day 11-12 due to the thin endometrium and it was repeated after 48 hr if 
      necessary. RESULTS: Endometrial thickness increased at 48 hr after the first 
      intervention in both groups. All participants needed second intervention due to 
      an inadequate endometrial expansion. After second intervention, endometrial 
      thickness was 7.21 +/- 0.18 and 5.76 +/- 0.97 mm in the PRP group and sham-catheter 
      group, respectively. There was a significant difference between the two groups. 
      (p  <  0.001). Embryo transfer was done for all patients in PRP group and just in 
      six cases in the sham-catheter group. Chemical pregnancy was reported in twelve 
      cases in the PRP group and two cases in the sham-catheter group. CONCLUSION: 
      According to this trial, PRP was effective in endometrial expansion in patients 
      with refractory thin endometrium.

AB  - A lot of effort has been done to unravel the genetics underlying early-onset 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). However, 
      many familial early-onset dementia (EOD) cases still show an unclear genetic 
      background. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the known causative 
      mutations and possible pathogenic variants associated with AD and FTLD in a 
      Finnish EOD cohort. The cohort consisted of 39 patients (mean age at onset 54.8 
      years, range 39-65) with a positive family history of dementia or an atypical or 
      rapidly progressive course of the disease. None of the patients carried the 
      C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion. Mutations and variants in APP, PSEN1, 
      PSEN2, MAPT, GRN, VCP, CHMP2B, FUS, TARDBP, TREM2, TMEM106B, UBQLN2, SOD1, PRNP, 
      UBQLN1, and BIN1 were screened by using a targeted next generation sequencing 
      panel. Two previously reported pathogenic mutations (PSEN1 p.His163Arg and MAPT 
      p.Arg406Trp) were identified in the cohort. Both patients had familial dementia 
      with an atypical early onset phenotype. In addition, a heterozygous p.Arg71Trp 
      mutation in PSEN2 with an uncertain pathogenic nature was identified in a patient 
      with neuropathologically confirmed AD. In conclusion, targeted investigation of 
      the known dementia-linked genes is worthwhile in patients with onset age under 55 
      and a positive family history, as well as in patients with atypical features.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) with its 
      growth factors in minimizing the side effects of rapid maxillary expansion (RME) 
      on the periodontal tissue of anchoring teeth using cone-beam computed tomography 
      (CBCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A randomized, split-mouth clinical trial was 
      conducted on 18 patients aged 12-16 years (14 +/- 1.65) with a skeletal maxillary 
      constriction who underwent RME using a Hyrax appliance. The sample was randomly 
      divided into two groups: intervention and control sides. PRP was prepared and 
      injected on the buccal aspect of supporting teeth in the intervention group. 
      High-resolution CBCT imaging (H-CBCT) was carried out preoperatively (T0) and 
      after 3 months of retention (T1) to study the buccal bone plate thickness (BBPT) 
      and buccal bone crest level (BBCL) of anchoring teeth. Changes induced by 
      expansion were evaluated using paired sample t-test (P < .05). RESULTS: Results 
      showed that there was no significant difference in BBPT and BBCL between the two 
      groups after RME (P > .05). The prevalence of dehiscence and fenestrations was 
      increased at (T1) in both groups and the percentage was higher in the PRP group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: RME induced vertical and horizontal bone loss. PRP did not minimize 
      alveolar defects after RME.

TI  - Autologous Platelet-Rich Plasma (CuteCell PRP) Safely Boosts In Vitro Human 
      Fibroblast Expansion.
PG  - 1550-1563
LID - 10.1089/ten.TEA.2018.0335 [doi]
AB  - Nowadays autologous fibroblast application for skin repair presents an important 
      clinical interest. In most cases, in vitro skin cell culture is mandatory. 
      However, cell expansion using xenogeneic or allogenic culture media presents some 
      disadvantages, such as the risk of infection transmission or slow cell expansion. 
      In this study, we investigated an autologous culture system to expand human skin 
      fibroblast cells in vitro with the patient's own platelet-rich plasma (PRP). 
      Human dermal fibroblasts were isolated from patients undergoing abdominoplasty, 
      and blood was collected to prepare nonactivated PRP using the CuteCell PRP 
      medical device. Cultures were followed up to 7 days using a medium supplemented 
      with either fetal bovine serum (FBS) or PRP. Fibroblasts cultured in medium 
      supplemented with PRP showed dose-dependently significantly higher proliferation 
      rates (up to 7.7 times with 20% of PRP) and initiated a faster migration in the 
      in vitro wound healing assay compared with FBS, while chromosomal stability was 
      maintained. At high concentrations, PRP changed fibroblast morphology, inducing 
      cytoskeleton rearrangement and an increase of alpha-smooth muscle actin and 
      vimentin expression. Our findings show that autologous PRP is an efficient and 
      cost-effective supplement for fibroblast culture, and should be considered as a 
      safe alternative to xenogeneic/allogenic blood derivatives for in vitro cell 
      expansion. Impact Statement Autologous dermal fibroblast graft is an important 
      therapy in skin defect repair, but in vitro skin cell culture is mandatory in 
      most cases. However, cell expansion using xenogeneic/allogenic culture media 
      presents some disadvantages, such as the risk of infection transmission. We 
      demonstrated that an autologous culture system with the patient's own 
      platelet-rich plasma is an efficient, cost-effective, and safe supplement for 
      fibroblast culture. As it respects the good manufacturing practices and 
      regulatory agencies standards, it should be considered as a potent alternative 
      and substitute to xenogeneic or allogenic blood derivatives for the validation of 
      future clinical protocols using in vitro cell expansion.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The disease course of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) can be 
      rapidly progressive, clinically resembling Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease (CJD). To 
      better understand factors contributing to this rapidly progressive disease 
      course, we describe load and distribution of neuropathology, and the presence of 
      possible disease-associated genetic defects in a post-mortem series of DLB cases 
      clinically suspected of CJD. METHODS: We included pathologically confirmed DLB 
      cases with a disease duration of 3.5 years or less from the Dutch Surveillance 
      Center for Prion Diseases, collected between 1998 and 2014. Lewy body disease 
      (LBD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathology were staged and 
      semi-quantitatively scored in selected brain regions. Whole exome sequencing 
      analysis of known disease-associated genes, copy number analysis, APOE epsilon 
      genotyping and C9orf72 repeat expansion analysis were performed to identify 
      defects in genes with a well-established involvement in Parkinson's disease or 
      AD. RESULTS: Diffuse LBD was present in nine cases, transitional LBD in six cases 
      and brainstem-predominant LBD in one case. Neocortical alpha-synuclein load was 
      significantly higher in cases with intermediate-to-high than in cases with 
      low-to-none AD-related pathology (p...=...0.007). We found two GBA variants (p.D140H 
      and p.E326K) in one patient and two heterozygous rare variants of unknown 
      significance in SORL1 in two patients. CONCLUSION: A high load of neocortical 
      alpha-synuclein pathology was present in most, but not all DLB cases. Additional 
      burden from presence of concomitant pathologies, synergistic effects and specific 
      genetic defects in the known disease-associated genes may have contributed to the 
      rapid disease progression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early onset dementias (EOD) are rare neurodegenerative dementias that 
      present before 65 years. Genetic factors have a substantially higher pathogenetic 
      contribution in EOD patients than in late onset dementia. OBJECTIVE: To identify 
      known and/or novel rare variants in major candidate genes associated to EOD by 
      high-throughput sequencing. Common-risk variants of apolipoprotein E (APOE) and 
      prion protein (PRNP) genes were also assessed. METHODS: We studied 22 EOD 
      patients recruited in Memory Clinics, in the context of studies investigating 
      genetic forms of dementia. Two methodological approaches were applied for the 
      target-Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis of these patients. In addition, 
      we performed progranulin plasma dosage, C9Orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion 
      analysis, and APOE genotyping. RESULTS: We detected three rare known pathogenic 
      mutations in the GRN and PSEN2 genes and eleven unknown-impact mutations in the 
      GRN, VCP, MAPT, FUS, TREM2, and NOTCH3 genes. Six patients were carriers of only 
      common risk variants (APOE and PRNP), and one did not show any risk 
      mutation/variant. Overall, 69% (n = 9) of our early onset Alzheimer's disease 
      (EAOD) patients, compared with 34% (n = 13) of sporadic late onset Alzheimer's 
      disease (LOAD) patients and 27% (n = 73) of non-affected controls (ADNI, whole 
      genome data), were carriers of at least two rare/common risk variants in the 
      analyzed candidate genes panel, excluding the full penetrant mutations. 
      CONCLUSION: This study suggests that EOD patients without full penetrant 
      mutations are characterized by higher probability to carry polygenic risk alleles 
      that patients with LOAD forms. This finding is in line with recently reported 
      evidence, thus suggesting that the genetic risk factors identified in LOAD might 
      modulate the risk also in EOAD.

AB  - Abnormal structural changes of the prion protein (PrP) are the cause of prion 
      disease in a wide range of mammals. However, spontaneous infected cases have not 
      been reported in chicken. Genetic variations of the prion protein gene (PRNP) may 
      impact susceptibility to prion disease but have not been investigated thus far. 
      Because an investigation of the chicken PRNP can improve the understanding of 
      characteristics related to resistance to prion disease, research on the chicken 
      PRNP is highly desirable. In this study, we investigated the genetic 
      characteristics of the chicken PRNP gene. For this, we performed direct 
      sequencing in 106 Dekalb White chickens and analyzed the genotype and allele 
      frequencies of chicken PRNP gene. We found two insertion and deletion 
      polymorphisms in the chicken PRNP: c.163_180delAACCCAGGGTACCCCCAT and 
      c.268_269insC. The former is a U2 hexapeptide deletion polymorphism. Of the 106 
      samples, 13 (12.26%) were insertion homozygotes, 89 (83.96%) were heterozygotes, 
      and 4 (3.77%) were deletion homozygotes in c.163_180delAACCCAGGGTACCCCCAT. In the 
      c.268_269insC polymorphism, 102 (96.23%) were deletion homozygotes, and 4 (3.77%) 
      were heterozygotes. Insertion homozygotes of c.268_269insC were not detected. Two 
      polymorphisms were in perfect linkage disequilibrium (LD) with a D' value of 1.0, 
      and three haplotypes were identified. Furthermore, PROVEAN evaluates 
      163_180delAACCCAGGGTACCCCCAT as 'deleterious' with a score of - 13.173. 
      Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the open reading frame 
      (ORF) of the PRNP gene were not found in the chicken. To the best of our 
      knowledge, this was the first report on the genetic variations of the chicken 
      PRNP gene.

AB  - Given the central role of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of common 
      neurodegenerative disorders, it is critical that mechanistic studies in human 
      tissue are interpreted in a genetically enlightened context. To address this, we 
      performed exome sequencing and copy number variant analysis on 1511 frozen human 
      brains with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 289), frontotemporal 
      dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD/ALS, n = 252), Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
      disease (CJD, n = 239), Parkinson's disease (PD, n = 39), dementia with Lewy 
      bodies (DLB, n = 58), other neurodegenerative, vascular, or neurogenetic 
      disorders (n = 266), and controls with no significant neuropathology (n = 368). 
      Genomic DNA was extracted from brain tissue in all cases before exome sequencing 
      (Illumina Nextera 62 Mb capture) with variants called by FreeBayes; copy number 
      variant (CNV) analysis (Illumina HumanOmniExpress-12 BeadChip); C9orf72 repeat 
      expansion detection; and APOE genotyping. Established or likely pathogenic 
      heterozygous, compound heterozygous, or homozygous variants, together with the 
      C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions and a copy number gain of APP, were 
      found in 61 brains. In addition to known risk alleles in 349 brains (23.9% of 
      1461 undergoing exome sequencing), we saw an association between rare variants in 
      GRN and DLB. Rare CNVs were found in <1.5% of brains, including copy number gains 
      of PRPH that were overrepresented in AD. Clinical, pathological, and genetic data 
      are available, enabling the retrieval of specific frozen brains through the UK 
      Medical Research Council Brain Banks Network. This allows direct access to 
      pathological and control human brain tissue based on an individual's genetic 
      architecture, thus enabling the functional validation of known genetic risk 
      factors and potentially pathogenic alleles identified in future studies.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Huntington disease (HD), a prototypic monogenic disease, is caused by 
      an expanded CAG repeat in the HTT gene exceeding 35 units. However, not all 
      patients with an HD phenotype carry the pathological expansion in HTT, and the 
      positive diagnosis rate is poor. OBJECTIVES: To examine patients with HD 
      phenotypes to determine the frequency of HD phenocopies with typical features of 
      HD but without pathological CAG repeat expansions in HTT in an attempt to improve 
      the positive diagnosis rate. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between January 
      1, 2004, and April 18, 2011, a total of 226 consecutive index patients with an HD 
      phenotype were referred to specialized clinics of the French National Huntington 
      Disease Reference Centre for Rare Diseases. They underwent detailed clinical 
      examination and follow-up, as well as neuropsychological, biological, imaging, 
      and genetic examinations. Nucleotide expansions in JPH3, ATN1, TBP, and C9ORF72 
      and mutations in PRNP, as well as acquired conditions commonly causing HD 
      phenocopies, were first screened. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The diagnostic rate 
      of HD phenocopies and frequency of other etiologies using deep clinical 
      phenotyping and next generation sequencing. Our goal was to improve the genetic 
      diagnosis of HD phenocopies and to identify new HD related genes. RESULTS: One 
      hundred ninety-eight patients carried a pathological CAG repeat expansion in HTT, 
      whereas 28 patients (12 women and 16 men) did not. Huntington disease phenocopies 
      accounted for 12.4%, and their mean (SD) age at onset was similar to those of the 
      HD-HTT group (47.3 [12.7] years vs 50.3 [16.4] years, P = .29). We first 
      identified 3 patients with abnormal CTG expansions in JPH3, a fourth patient with 
      an antiphospholipid syndrome, and a fifth patient with B12 avitaminosis. A 
      custom-made 63-gene panel was generated based on clinical evolution and exome 
      sequencing. It contained genes responsible for HD phenocopies and other 
      neurodegenerative conditions, as well as candidate genes from exome sequencing in 
      3 index cases with imaging features of brain iron accumulation. We identified 
      mutations in genes associated with neurodegeneration, including CACNA1A (n = 2), 
      VPS13A (n = 1), UBQLN2 (n = 1), and VCP (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Huntington disease phenocopies without CAG repeat expansions in HTT are not rare, 
      occurring in 12.4% (28 of 226) herein, and should be considered in genetic 
      counseling. We used next-generation sequencing combined with clinical data and 
      disease evolution to explore multiple etiologies simultaneously. Our combined 
      clinical and genetic exploration of 28 HD phenocopies identified the underlying 
      cause in 35.7% (10 of 28). In conclusion, the etiologies of HD phenocopies are 
      heterogeneous, and clinical evolution should be taken into account when searching 
      for a genetic cause. The panel of candidate genes to be examined is larger than 
      expected but can be guided by specific imaging and clinical features. Other 
      neurodegenerative diseases with late onset in which variant segregation cannot be 
      verified could be productively explored with the combined approach illustrated 
      herein.

      Cells on Platelet-Rich Plasma Gels.
PG  - 1543-1547
AB  - Purpose/Aim of the study: To assess if corneal epithelium can be cultured ex vivo 
      from corneas eviscerated due to irretrievable trauma, according to a cell culture 
      method that made use of autologous platelet-rich plasma (A-PRP) as culture 
      substrate. To compare corneal epithelium cultured ex vivo from corneas 
      eviscerated following trauma using A-PRP combined with Dulbecco's modified Eagles 
      medium (DMEM), versus DMEM alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a laboratory 
      case-controlled study of human corneal cells cultured in a mixture of A-PRP and 
      DMEM, versus DMEM alone from six eviscerated corneas. A 100 explants were 
      created, of which 50 explants were plated on A-PRP-gel construct combined with 
      DMEM and 50 controls were placed in serum-free DMEM alone. Donor patients 
      received systemic antibiotics prior to evisceration. RESULTS: Confluent 
      epithelium in monolayers could be cultured when donor limbal biopsies were placed 
      in a mixture of A-PRP culture medium and DMEM. No growth was observed when 
      corneas were placed in serum-free DMEM medium only (p < 0.05). No bacterial 
      infection was observed in cultures. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that 
      A-PRP is a viable and effective alternative to bovine serum for the ex vivo 
      expansion of limbal epithelial cells. It also shows that eviscerated corneas are 
      a viable source of donor tissue for this purpose in South Africa where access to 
      tissue banks is limited.

PG  - 38
LID - 10.1186/1750-1326-9-38 [doi]
LID - 38
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in chromosome 9 open reading frame 
      72 (C9ORF72) are causative for frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and motor neuron 
      disease (MND). Substantial phenotypic heterogeneity has been described in 
      patients with these expansions. We set out to identify genetic modifiers of 
      disease risk, age at onset, and survival after onset that may contribute to this 
      clinical variability. RESULTS: We examined a cohort of 330 C9ORF72 expansion 
      carriers and 374 controls. In these individuals, we assessed variants previously 
      implicated in FTD and/or MND; 36 variants were included in our analysis. After 
      adjustment for multiple testing, our analysis revealed three variants 
      significantly associated with age at onset (rs7018487 [UBAP1; p-value = 0.003], 
      rs6052771 [PRNP; p-value = 0.003], and rs7403881 [MT-Ie; p-value = 0.003]), and 
      six variants significantly associated with survival after onset (rs5848 [GRN; 
      p-value = 0.001], rs7403881 [MT-Ie; p-value = 0.001], rs13268953 [ELP3; p-value = 
      0.003], the epsilon 4 allele [APOE; p-value = 0.004], rs12608932 [UNC13A; p-value 
      = 0.003], and rs1800435 [ALAD; p-value = 0.003]). CONCLUSIONS: Variants 
      identified through this study were previously reported to be involved in FTD 
      and/or MND, but we are the first to describe their effects as potential disease 
      modifiers in the presence of a clear pathogenic mutation (i.e. C9ORF72 repeat 
      expansion). Although validation of our findings is necessary, these variants 
      highlight the importance of protein degradation, antioxidant defense and 
      RNA-processing pathways, and additionally, they are promising targets for the 
      development of therapeutic strategies and prognostic tests.

AB  - Identification of a specific genetic cause of early onset dementia (EOD) is 
      important but can be difficult because of pleiotropy, locus heterogeneity and 
      accessibility of gene tests. Here we assess the use of next generation sequencing 
      (NGS) technologies as a quick, accurate and cost effective method to determine 
      genetic diagnosis in EOD. We developed gene panel based technologies to assess 16 
      genes known to harbour mutations causal of dementia and combined these with PCR 
      based assessments of the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion and the 
      octapeptide repeat region of PRNP. In a blinded study of 95 samples we show very 
      high sensitivity and specificity are achievable using either Ion Torrent or MiSeq 
      sequencing platforms. Modifications to the gene panel permit accurate detection 
      of structural variation in APP. In 2/10 samples which had been selected because 
      they possess a variant of uncertain significance the new technology discovered a 
      causal mutation in genes not previously sequenced. A large proportion (23/85) of 
      samples showed genetic variants of uncertain significance in addition to known 
      mutations. The MRC Dementia Gene Panel and similar technologies are likely to be 
      transformational in EOD diagnosis with a significant impact on the proportion of 
      patients in whom a genetic cause is identified.

TI  - Reduction of mutant ataxin-7 expression restores motor function and prevents 
      cerebellar synaptic reorganization in a conditional mouse model of SCA7.
PG  - 890-903

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CAG - polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the ataxin-7 
      gene. In polyQ disorders, synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration may develop 
      prior to symptom onset. However, conditional expression studies of polyQ disease 
      models demonstrate that suppression of gene expression can yield complete 
      reversal of established behavioral abnormalities. To determine if SCA7 
      neurological and neurodegenerative phenotypes are reversible, we crossed 
      PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q BAC transgenic mice with a tamoxifen-inducible Cre 
      recombinase transgenic line, CAGGS-Cre-ER. PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q BAC;CAGGS-Cre-ER 
      bigenic mice were treated with a single dose of tamoxifen 1 month after the onset 
      of detectable ataxia, which resulted in ~50% reduction of polyQ-ataxin-7 
      expression. Tamoxifen treatment halted or reversed SCA7 motor symptoms, reduced 
      ataxin-7 aggregation in Purkinje cells (PCs), and prevented loss of climbing 
      fiber (CF)-PC synapses in comparison to vehicle-treated bigenic animals and 
      tamoxifen-treated PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q BAC single transgenic mice. Despite this 
      phenotype rescue, reduced ataxin-7 expression did not result in full recovery of 
      cerebellar molecular layer thickness or prevent Bergmann glia degeneration. These 
      results demonstrate that suppression of mutant gene expression by only 50% in a 
      polyQ disease model can have a significant impact on disease phenotypes, even 
      when initiated after the onset of detectable behavioral deficits. The findings 
      reported here are consistent with the emerging view that therapies aimed at 
      reducing neurotoxic gene expression hold the potential to halt or reverse disease 
      progression in afflicted patients, even after the onset of neurological 
      disability.

AB  - The role of normal cellular prion protein (PrP) remains to be fully elucidated; 
      however, the protein is crucial for the infection and progression of prion 
      diseases. Recent evidence indicates that PrP is a metalloprotein since the 
      octapeptide repeat sequences in the protein have high affinity for various 
      divalent cations and the binding sites appear to play a role in the pathogenesis 
      of prion diseases. In our present study, we tested several divalent metals 
      including manganese and cadmium and determined their effects on protein 
      degradation and protein aggregation in mouse neuronal cells expressing PrP. 
      Cadmium was more neurotoxic than manganese following 24h exposure. Manganese did 
      not show any significant effect on the inhibition of proteasomal activity or 
      formation of high molecular weight ubiquitinated PrPs. Interestingly, treatment 
      with cadmium profoundly inhibited proteasomal activity, which resulted in greatly 
      increased formation of high molecular weight ubiquitinated PrPs. 
      Immunohistochemical analysis also revealed a dramatic increase in formation of 
      oligomers after cadmium treatment. Cadmium also increased the formation of 
      ubiquitinated PrP, but it did not lead to the formation of proteinase-K resistant 
      PrP. Collectively, our results show that a divalent metal, cadmium affects 
      proteasomal function and PrP aggregation, which promote neurotoxicity.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 cerebellar disease requires the coordinated action 
      of mutant ataxin-7 in neurons and glia, and displays non-cell-autonomous bergmann 
      glia degeneration.
PG  - 16269-78
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4000-11.2011 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a dominantly inherited disorder 
      characterized by cerebellum and brainstem neurodegeneration. SCA7 is caused by a 
      CAG/polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the ataxin-7 gene. We previously 
      reported that directed expression of polyQ-ataxin-7 in Bergmann glia (BG) in 
      transgenic mice leads to ataxia and non-cell-autonomous Purkinje cell (PC) 
      degeneration. To further define the cellular basis of SCA7, we derived a 
      conditional inactivation mouse model by inserting a loxP-flanked ataxin-7 cDNA 
      with 92 repeats into the translational start site of the murine prion protein 
      (PrP) gene in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). The PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q 
      BAC mice developed neurological disease, and exhibited cerebellar degeneration 
      and BG process loss. To inactivate polyQ-ataxin-7 expression in specific 
      cerebellar cell types, we crossed PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q BAC mice with Gfa2-Cre 
      transgenic mice (to direct Cre to BG) or Pcp2-Cre transgenic mice (which yields 
      Cre in PCs and inferior olive). Excision of ataxin-7 from BG partially rescued 
      the behavioral phenotype, but did not prevent BG process loss or molecular layer 
      thinning, while excision of ataxin-7 from PCs and inferior olive provided 
      significantly greater rescue and prevented both pathological changes, revealing a 
      non-cell-autonomous basis for BG pathology. When we prevented expression of 
      mutant ataxin-7 in BG, PCs, and inferior olive by deriving 
      Gfa2-Cre;Pcp2-Cre;PrP-floxed-SCA7-92Q BAC triple transgenic mice, we noted a 
      dramatic improvement in SCA7 disease phenotypes. These findings indicate that 
      SCA7 disease pathogenesis involves a convergence of alterations in a variety of 
      different cell types to fully recapitulate the cerebellar degeneration.

TI  - Transgenic mice with SCA10 pentanucleotide repeats show motor phenotype and 
      susceptibility to seizure: a toxic RNA gain-of-function model.
PG  - 706-14
LID - 10.1002/jnr.22786 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder manifested by ataxia and seizure. SCA10 is caused by a large expansion 
      of an intronic ATTCT pentanucleotide repeat in the ATXN10 gene. We have recently 
      postulated a toxic RNA-mediated gain of function in the pathogenesis of spinal 
      cerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10). The spliced intron-9 RNA containing the 
      expanded AUUCU repeat aggregates in SCA10 cells and sequesters hnRNP K. hnRNP K 
      sequestration triggers the translocation of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) to 
      mitochondria, leading to activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis. To confirm the 
      toxic RNA-mediated gain of function, we generated a new transgenic mouse model in 
      which the expanded pentanucleotide repeats are constructed in the 3'-untranslated 
      region (3'UTR) to ensure transcription without translation of the repeat. We 
      constructed an artificial transgene containing the SCA10 (ATTCT)(500) track 
      within the 3'UTR of the LacZ gene driven by the rat prion promoter (PrP) and used 
      this to generate a new transgenic mouse model for SCA10. We then examined these 
      mice for neurological phenotypes and histopathological, molecular, and cellular 
      changes. The transgenic mice showed irregular gait and increased seizure 
      susceptibility at the age of 6 months, resembling the clinical phenotype of 
      SCA10. The cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and pontine nuclei showed neuronal loss. 
      The brains of these animals also showed molecular and cellular changes similar to 
      those previously found in an SCA10 cell model. Expression of the expanded SCA10 
      AUUCU repeat within the 3'UTR of a gene results in neuronal loss with associated 
      gait abnormalities and increased seizure susceptibility phenotypes, which 
      resemble those seen in SCA10 patients. Moreover, these results bolster the idea 
      that the SCA10 disease mechanism is mediated by a toxic RNA gain-of-function 
      mutation of the expanded AUUCU repeat.

TI  - Early onset prion disease from octarepeat expansion correlates with copper 
      binding properties.

AB  - Insertional mutations leading to expansion of the octarepeat domain of the prion 
      protein (PrP) are directly linked to prion disease. While normal PrP has four 
      PHGGGWGQ octapeptide segments in its flexible N-terminal domain, expanded forms 
      may have up to nine additional octapeptide inserts. The type of prion disease 
      segregates with the degree of expansion. With up to four extra octarepeats, the 
      average onset age is above 60 years, whereas five to nine extra octarepeats 
      results in an average onset age between 30 and 40 years, a difference of almost 
      three decades. In wild-type PrP, the octarepeat domain takes up copper (Cu(2+)) 
      and is considered essential for in vivo function. Work from our lab demonstrates 
      that the copper coordination mode depends on the precise ratio of Cu(2+) to 
      protein. At low Cu(2+) levels, coordination involves histidine side chains from 
      adjacent octarepeats, whereas at high levels each repeat takes up a single copper 
      ion through interactions with the histidine side chain and neighboring backbone 
      amides. Here we use both octarepeat constructs and recombinant PrP to examine how 
      copper coordination modes are influenced by octarepeat expansion. We find that 
      there is little change in affinity or coordination mode populations for 
      octarepeat domains with up to seven segments (three inserts). However, domains 
      with eight or nine total repeats (four or five inserts) become energetically 
      arrested in the multi-histidine coordination mode, as dictated by higher copper 
      uptake capacity and also by increased binding affinity. We next pooled all 
      published cases of human prion disease resulting from octarepeat expansion and 
      find remarkable agreement between the sudden length-dependent change in copper 
      coordination and onset age. Together, these findings suggest that either loss of 
      PrP copper-dependent function or loss of copper-mediated protection against PrP 
      polymerization makes a significant contribution to early onset prion disease.

AB  - Point and octapeptide repeat (24 bp) insertional mutations in the prion protein 
      gene (PRNP) cause a dominantly transmitted dementia, associated with spongiform 
      degeneration of the brain, astrocytic gliosis and neuronal loss due to cell 
      accumulation of mutated protease resistant prion protein. The octapeptide repeat 
      region lies between codon 51 and 91, and comprises a nonapeptide followed by a 
      tandem repeat containing four copies of an octapeptide. The normal tandem length 
      in healthy individuals is five repeats R1-R2-R2-R3-R4, but mutations can contain 
      up to nine additional extra repeats. Some insight into this genetic mechanism 
      comes from the de novo meiotic insertional extra repeat mutation in PRNP we 
      detected in a patient whose parents had a normal phenotype and a wild-type 
      sequence in the same gene. To our knowledge, this is the first time this 
      condition has been described.

TI  - Anti-bovine prion protein RNA aptamer containing tandem GGA repeat interacts both 
      with recombinant bovine prion protein and its beta isoform with high affinity.
PG  - 73-80
AB  - In order to obtain RNA aptamers against bovine prion protein (bPrP), we carried 
      out in vitro selection from RNA pools containing a 55-nucleotide randomized 
      region to target recombinant bPrP. Most of obtained aptamers contained conserved 
      GGA tandem repeats (GGA)(4) and aptamer #1 (apt #1) showed a high affinity for 
      both bPrP and its beta isoform (bPrP-beta). The sequence of apt #1 suggested that 
      it would have a G-quadruplex structure, which was confirmed using CD spectra in 
      titration with KCl. A mutagenic study of this conserved region, and competitive 
      assays, showed that the conserved (GGA)(4) sequence is important for specific 
      binding to bPrP and bPrP-beta. Following 5'-biotinylation, aptamer #1 
      specifically detected PrP(c) in bovine brain homogenate in a Northwestern 
      blotting assay. Protein deletion mutant analysis showed that the bPrP aptamer 
      binds within 25-131 of the bPrP sequence. Interestingly, the minimized aptamer #1 
      (17 nt) showed greater binding to bPrP and bPrP-beta as compared to apt #1. This 
      minimized form of aptamer #1 may therefore be useful in the detection of bPrP, 
      diagnosis of prion disease, enrichment of bPr and ultimately in gaining a better 
      understanding of prion diseases.

TI  - A patient with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease with an insertion of 7 octa-repeats in 
      the PRNP gene: molecular characteristics and clinical features.
PG  - 519-23
LID - 10.1097/MAJ.0b013e3181643e50 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the features of neuropathology, abnormal prion protein 
      (PrP) molecules, and clinical data of a Chinese woman diagnosed with familiar 
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), having 7 octa-repeats inserted with codon 129 
      methionine homozygote in the PRNP gene. METHODS: Neuropathologic characteristics 
      of the brain were analyzed by hemotoxylin-eosin stain and electronic microscopy. 
      The presence of abnormal PrP in brains was detected by proteinase K and PrP 
      molecules were evaluated by deglycosylation assay. RESULTS: Spongiform 
      degeneration, with diffuse neuronal loss and mild astrocytic gliosis, as well as 
      with profound degeneration of neurons and astrocytes was observed. Proteinase 
      K-resistant PrP was deposited widely in various regions of the brain. Calculation 
      of the glycosylation ratios of proteinase K-resistant PrP molecules identified 
      that the monoglycosyl isomer was predominant. PrP deglycosylation tests allowed 
      for the identification of a predominant 19-kDa PrP signal that represents a 
      partially proteolytic C-terminal segment, a 27-kDa band that represents the 
      full-length wild-type PrP molecule, and a 30-kDa band that probably corresponds 
      to the full-length mutant PrP molecule. CONCLUSION: : Sporadic CJD-like 
      neuropathologic changes and deposits of proteinase K-resistant PrP have been 
      identified in this familiar CJD case with a 168 base pair nucleotide insertion. 
      The clinical features differ from previously reported cases that had 7 
      octa-repeat insertion, but bear similarities to sporadic CJD.

TI  - Ligand binding promotes prion protein aggregation--role of the octapeptide

AB  - Aggregation of the normal cellular prion protein, PrP, is important in the 
      pathogenesis of prion disease. PrP binds glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and divalent 
      cations, such as Cu(2+) and Zn(2+). Here, we report our findings that GAG and 
      Cu(2+) promote the aggregation of recombinant human PrP (rPrP). The normal 
      cellular prion protein has five octapeptide repeats. In the presence of either 
      GAG or Cu(2+), mutant rPrPs with eight or ten octapeptide repeats are more 
      aggregation prone, exhibit faster kinetics and form larger aggregates than 
      wild-type PrP. When the GAG-binding motif, KKRPK, is deleted the effect of GAG 
      but not that of Cu(2+) is abolished. By contrast, when the Cu(2+)-binding motif, 
      the octapeptide-repeat region, is deleted, neither GAG nor Cu(2+) is able to 
      promote aggregation. Therefore, the octapeptide-repeat region is critical in the 
      aggregation of rPrP, irrespective of the promoting ligand. Furthermore, 
      aggregation of rPrP in the presence of GAG is blocked with anti-PrP mAbs, whereas 
      none of the tested anti-PrP mAbs block Cu(2+)-promoted aggregation. However, a 
      mAb that is specific for an epitope at the N-terminus enhances aggregation in the 
      presence of either GAG or Cu(2+). Therefore, although binding of either GAG or 
      Cu(2+) promotes the aggregation of rPrP, their aggregation processes are 
      different, suggesting multiple pathways of rPrP aggregation.

TI  - Expansion of the octarepeat domain alters the misfolding pathway but not the 
      folding pathway of the prion protein.
PG  - 6267-78
LID - 10.1021/bi800253c [doi]
AB  - A misfolded conformation of the prion protein (PrP), PrP (Sc), is the essential 
      component of prions, the infectious agents that cause transmissible 
      neurodegenerative diseases. Insertional mutations that lead to an increase in the 
      number of octarepeats (ORs) in PrP are linked to familial human prion disease. In 
      this study, we investigated how expansion of the OR domain causes PrP to favor a 
      prion-like conformation. Therefore, we compared the conformational and 
      aggregation modulating properties of wild-type versus expanded OR domains, either 
      as a fusion construct with the protein G B1 domain (GB1-OR) or as an integral 
      part of full-length mouse PrP (MoPrP). Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we 
      first demonstrated that ORs are not unfolded but exist as an ensemble of three 
      distinct conformers: polyproline helix-like, beta-turn, and "Trp-related". Domain 
      expansion had little effect on the conformation of GB1-OR fusion proteins. When 
      part of MoPrP however, OR domain expansion changed PrP's folding landscape, not 
      by hampering the production of native alpha-helical monomers but by greatly 
      reducing the propensity to form amyloid and by altering the assembly of 
      misfolded, beta-rich aggregates. These features may relate to subtle pH-dependent 
      conformational differences between wild-type and mutant monomers. In conclusion, 
      we propose that PrP insertional mutations are pathogenic because they enhance 
      specific misfolding pathways of PrP rather than by undermining native folding. 
      This idea was supported by a trial bioassay in transgenic mice overexpressing 
      wild-type MoPrP, where intracerebral injection of recombinant MoPrP with an 
      expanded OR domain but not wild-type MoPrP caused prion disease.

AB  - Genetic variability might contribute to species specificity of prion diseases in 
      various organisms. In this study, structures of the prion protein gene (PRNP) and 
      its amino acids were compared among species of which sequence data were 
      available. Comparisons of PRNP DNA sequences among 12 species including human, 
      chimpanzee, monkey, bovine, ovine, dog, mouse, rat, wallaby, opossum, chicken and 
      zebrafish allowed us to identify candidate regulatory regions in intron 1 and 
      3'-untranslated region (UTR) in addition to the coding region. Highly conserved 
      putative binding sites for transcription factors, such as heat shock factor 2 
      (HSF2) and myocite enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), were discovered in the intron 1. In 
      3'-UTR, the functional sequence (ATTAAA) for nucleus-specific polyadenylation was 
      found in all the analysed species. The functional sequence (TTTTTAT) for 
      maturation-specific polyadenylation was identically observed only in ovine, and 
      one or two nucleotide mismatches in the other species. A comparison of the amino 
      acid sequences in 53 species revealed a large sequence identity. Especially the 
      octapeptide repeat region was observed in all the species but frog and zebrafish. 
      Functional changes and susceptibility to prion diseases with various isoforms of 
      prion protein could be caused by numeric variability and conformational changes 
      discovered in the repeat sequences.

TI  - Unveiling the role of histidine and tyrosine residues on the conformation of the 
      avian prion hexarepeat domain.
PG  - 5182-8

AB  - The prion protein (PrPC) is a glycoprotein that in mammals, differently from 
      avians, can lead to prion diseases, by misfolding into a beta-sheet-rich 
      pathogenic isoform (PrPSc). Mammal and avian proteins show different N-terminal 
      tandem repeats: PHGGGWGQ and PHNPGY, both containing histidine, whereas tyrosine 
      is included only in the primary sequence of the avian protein. Here, by means of 
      potentiometric, circular dichroism (CD), and molecular dynamics (MD) studies at 
      different pH values, we have investigated the conformation of the avian 
      tetrahexarepeat (PHNPGY)4 (TetraHexaPY) with both N- and C-termini blocked by 
      acetylation and amidation, respectively. We have found, also with the help of a 
      recently proposed protein chirality indicator (Pietropaolo, A.; Muccioli, L.; 
      Berardi, R.; Zannoni, C. Proteins 2008, 70, 667-677), a conformational dependence 
      on the protonation states of histidine and tyrosine residues: the turn formation 
      is pH driven, and at physiological pH a pivotal role is played by the tyrosine OH 
      groups which give rise to a very compact bent structure of backbone upon forming 
      a hydrogen-bond network.

TI  - Prion protein insertional mutations increase aggregation propensity but not fiber 
      stability.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/1471-2091-9-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mutations in the PRNP gene account for ~15% of all prion disease 
      cases. Little is understood about the mechanism of how some of these mutations in 
      PRNP cause the protein to aggregate into amyloid fibers or cause disease. We have 
      taken advantage of a chimeric protein system to study the oligopeptide repeat 
      domain (ORD) expansions of the prion protein, PrP, and their effect on protein 
      aggregation and amyloid fiber formation. We replaced the ORD of the yeast prion 
      protein Sup35p with that from wild type and expanded ORDs of PrP and compared 
      their biochemical properties in vitro. We previously determined that these 
      chimeric proteins maintain the [PSI+] yeast prion phenotype in vivo. 
      Interestingly, we noted that the repeat expanded chimeric prions seemed to be 
      able to maintain a stronger strain of [PSI+] and convert from [psi-] to [PSI+] 
      with a much higher frequency. In this study we have attempted to understand the 
      biochemical properties of these chimeric proteins and to establish a system to 
      study the properties of the ORD of PrP both in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: 
      Investigation of the chimeric proteins in vitro reveals that repeat-expansions 
      increase aggregation propensity and that the kinetics of fiber formation depends 
      on the number of repeats. The fiber formation reactions are promiscuous in that 
      the chimeric protein containing 14 repeats can readily cross-seed fiber formation 
      of proteins that have the wild type number of repeats. Morphologically, the 
      amyloid fibers formed by repeat-expanded proteins associate with each other to 
      form large clumps that were not as prevalent in fibers formed by proteins 
      containing the wild type number of repeats. Despite the increased aggregation 
      propensity and lateral association of the repeat expanded proteins, there was no 
      corresponding increase in the stability of the fibers formed. Therefore, we 
      predict that the differences in fibers formed with different repeat lengths may 
      not be due to gross changes in the amyloid core. CONCLUSION: The biochemical 
      observations presented here explain the properties of these chimeric proteins 
      previously observed in yeast. More importantly, they suggest a mechanism for the 
      observed correlation between age of onset and disease severity with respect to 
      the length of the ORD in humans.

PG  - 683-92
LID - 10.1016/j.bbapap.2008.01.011 [doi]
AB  - Prion diseases are associated with conformational change in the copper-binding 
      protein PrP. The copper-binding sites in PrP are located in the N-terminal region 
      of the molecule and comprise a series of tandem repeats of the sequence PHGGGWGQ 
      together with two histidines at residues 96 and 111 (human PrP numbering). The 
      co-ordination of copper ions within the non-octapeptide repeat metal ion-binding 
      site involves Met109 (human numbering, which corresponds with Met112 in ovine 
      PrP) and the binding of copper to this site leads to an increase in beta-sheet 
      formation in PrP. Here we have investigated the influence of the M112T 
      polymorphism on copper-induced structural changes in ovine recombinant PrP. 
      M112ARQ and T112ARQ ovine PrP show similar secondary structure although M112ARQ 
      appears more thermostable than T112ARQ. Following treatment with copper, M112ARQ 
      showed a greater increase in beta-sheet content than did T112ARQ when measured by 
      CD spectroscopy and by ELISA using anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies. These 
      biochemical and biophysical differences between M112ARQ and T112ARQ correlate 
      with similar differences seen between allelic variants of ovine PrP associated 
      with susceptibility and resistance to classical scrapie. These observations 
      suggest that T112ARQ may provide a measure of resistance to classical scrapie 
      pathogenesis compared to M112ARQ.

TI  - Inherited prion disease with 5-OPRI: phenotype modification by repeat length and 
      codon 129.
PG  - 730-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human prion diseases have sporadic, acquired and inherited etiologies 
      and show considerable phenotypic heterogeneity. An individual inherited prion 
      disease offers an opportunity to study the determinants of this clinicopathologic 
      heterogeneity among individuals with the same causal mutation. METHODS: We report 
      clinical and pathologic data from three families with different 5-octapeptide 
      repeat insertion (5-OPRI) mutations of the prion protein gene (PRNP), extending 
      the reported phenotypic range of this mutation. RESULTS: The proband of a South 
      African family presented with a rapidly progressive dementia and atypical 
      pathology associated with kuru-like prion protein plaques. The original mutation 
      in this family probably occurred on a PRNP allele encoding a 1-octapeptide repeat 
      deletion polymorphism. This has not been previously reported as a precursor 
      allele in over 30 other OPRI mutation kindreds. An English family with a 
      genetically distinct mutation but identical protein product showed clinical 
      onsets that varied 30 years between father and daughter, an effect that may be 
      explained by their genotypes at PRNP codon 129. A patient from Northern Ireland 
      with a phenotype of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease presenting with visual 
      disturbance was unexpectedly found to have a 5-OPRI. CONCLUSIONS: When these 
      cases were combined with the existing world literature, the mean age at onset for 
      patients with 5-octapeptide repeat insertion (5-OPRI) was significantly later 
      than that for patients with 6-OPRI, but both mutations exhibit a similar powerful 
      disease modifying effect of PRNP codon 129.

TI  - Prion protein repeat expansion results in increased aggregation and reveals 
      phenotypic variability.
PG  - 5445-55
AB  - Mammalian prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders dependent on the 
      prion protein PrP. Expansion of the oligopeptide repeats (ORE) found in PrP is 
      associated with inherited prion diseases. Patients with ORE frequently harbor PrP 
      aggregates, but other factors may contribute to pathology, as they often present 
      with unexplained phenotypic variability. We created chimeric yeast-mammalian 
      prion proteins to examine the influence of the PrP ORE on prion properties in 
      yeast. Remarkably, all chimeric proteins maintained prion characteristics. The 
      largest repeat expansion chimera displayed a higher propensity to maintain a 
      self-propagating aggregated state. Strikingly, the repeat expansion conferred 
      increased conformational flexibility, as observed by enhanced phenotypic 
      variation. Furthermore, the repeat expansion chimera displayed an increased rate 
      of prion conversion, but only in the presence of another aggregate, the [RNQ+] 
      prion. We suggest that the PrP ORE increases the conformational flexibility of 
      the prion protein, thereby enhancing the formation of multiple distinct aggregate 
      structures and allowing more frequent prion conversion. Both of these 
      characteristics may contribute to the phenotypic variability associated with PrP 
      repeat expansion diseases.

TI  - Exclusion of mutations in the PRNP, JPH3, TBP, ATN1, CREBBP, POU3F2 and FTL genes 
      as a cause of disease in Portuguese patients with a Huntington-like phenotype.
PG  - 645-651
LID - 10.1007/s10038-006-0001-9 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterised by chorea, cognitive impairment, dementia and personality changes, 
      caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the HD gene. Often, patients with a 
      similar clinical presentation do not carry expansions of the CAG repeat in this 
      gene [Huntington disease-like (HDL) patients]. We report the genetic analysis of 
      107 Portuguese patients with an HDL phenotype. The HDL genes PRNP and JPH3, 
      encoding the prion protein and junctophilin-3, respectively, were screened for 
      repeat expansions in these patients. Given the partial clinical overlap of SCA17, 
      DRPLA and neuroferritinopathy with HD, their causative genes (TBP, ATN1, and FTL, 
      respectively) were also analysed. Finally, repeat expansions in two candidate 
      genes, CREBBP and POU3F2, which encode the nuclear transcriptional coactivator 
      CREB-binding protein and the CNS-specific transcription factor N-Oct-3, 
      respectively, were also studied. Expansions of the repetitive tracts of the PRNP, 
      JPH3, TBP, ATN1, CREBBP and POU3F2 genes were excluded in all patients, as were 
      sequence alterations in the FTL gene. Since none of the genes already included in 
      the differential diagnosis of HD was responsible for the disease in our sample, 
      the genetic heterogeneity of the HDL phenotype is still open for investigation.

TI  - Structure and stability of the CuII complexes with tandem repeats of the chicken 
      prion.
PG  - 12940-54
AB  - Prion protein (PrP) misfolding is one of the pivotal issues in understanding the 
      rudiments of neurodegenerative disorders. The conformational change of mammalian 
      cellular PrP to scrapie PrP is caused by an unknown agent, but there is 
      reasonable evidence supporting the key role of copper ions in this process. The 
      structure of the avian PrP was found to be very similar to the mammalian protein, 
      although there is only 30% homology in the secondary structure. This work shows 
      that copper ions are very effectively bound by hexarepeat fragments of chicken 
      prion protein, although not as effectively as it was found in the case of 
      mammalian protein. By means of potentiometric and spectroscopic techniques 
      (nuclear magnetic resonance, circular dichroism, UV-vis, and electronic 
      paramagnetic resonance), it was shown that Cu(II) ions coordinate to the chicken 
      PrP hexapeptide domain in physiological pH via imidazole nitrogen donors of His 
      residue(s). The binding pattern changes the structure of peptide involved, 
      indicating a possible impact of Cu(II) ions in the biology and pathology of 
      nonmammalian PrP, which could be similar to that found for mammalian PrP. The 
      present study shows that, similar to the human prion octapeptide repeats, chicken 
      prion hexapeptide repeats might bind copper ions in two different ways, depending 
      on the number of repeats and metal/ligand molar ratio: (i) an intra-repeat 
      coordination mode in which copper ion is chelated by His imidazole and 
      deprotonated amide nitrogen in monomeric peptide and (ii) an inter-repeat 
      coordination mode in which a polymeric peptide ligand (dimer and trimer) forms 
      polyimidazole complexes that are very stable at physiological pH. Two proline 
      residues inserted into the hexapeptide unit have a critical impact on the 
      metal-binding ability.

TI  - The formation of Escherichia coli curli amyloid fibrils is mediated by prion-like 
      peptide repeats.
PG  - 245-52
AB  - Amyloid fibril formation is the hallmark of major human maladies including 
      Alzheimer's disease, type II diabetes, and prion diseases. Prion-like phenomena 
      were also observed in yeast. Although not evolutionarily related, one similarity 
      between the animal PrP and the yeast Sup35 prion proteins is the occurrence of 
      short peptide repeats that are assumed to play a key role in the assembly of the 
      amyloid structures. It was recently demonstrated that typical amyloid fibril 
      formation is associated with biofilm formation by Escherichia coli. Here, we note 
      the functional and structural similarity between oligopeptide repeats of the 
      major curli protein and those of animal and yeast prions. We demonstrate that 
      synthetic peptides corresponding to the repeats form fibrillar structures. 
      Furthermore, conjugation of beta-breaker elements to the prion-like repeat 
      significantly inhibits amyloid formation and cell invasion of curli-expressing 
      bacteria. This implies a functional role of the repeat in the self-assembly of 
      the fibrils. Since mammal prion, yeast prion, and curli protein are 
      evolutionarily distinct, the conserved peptide repeats most likely define an 
      optimized self-association motif that was independently evolved by diverse 
      systems.

TI  - Copper(II) complexes with chicken prion repeats: influence of proline and 
      tyrosine residues on the coordination features.
PG  - 463-75
AB  - The prion protein (PrP(c)) is a copper-binding glycoprotein that can misfold into 
      a beta-sheet-rich and pathogenic isoform (PrP(sc)) leading to prion diseases. The 
      first non-mammalian PrP(c) was identified in chicken and it was found to keep 
      many structural motifs present in mammalian PrP(c), despite the low sequence 
      identity (approximately 40%) between the two primary structures. The present 
      paper describes the synthesis and the coordination properties of some hexapeptide 
      fragments (namely, PHNPGY , HNPGYP and NPGYPH) as well as a bishexapeptide 
      (PHNPGYPHNPGY), which encompasses two hexarepeats. The copper(II) complexes were 
      characterized by means of potentiometric, UV-vis, circular dichroism and electron 
      paramagnetic resonance techniques. We also report the synthesis of three 
      hexapeptides (PHNPGF, HNPGFP and NPGFPH), in which one tyrosine was replaced by 
      phenylalanine as well as two bishexapeptides in which either one (PHNPGFPHNPGY 
      and PHNPGYPHNPGF), or two tyrosines were replaced by phenylalanine, in order to 
      check whether tyrosine was involved in copper(II) binding. Overall, the results 
      indicate that the major copper(II) species formed by the chicken PrP 
      dodecapeptides are stabler than the analogous species reported for the peptide 
      fragments containing two octarepeat peptides from the mammalian prion protein. It 
      is concluded that the presence of four prolyl residues, that are break points in 
      copper coordination, induces the metal-assisted formation of macrochelates as 
      well as the formation of binuclear species. Furthermore, it has been shown that 
      the phenolic group is directly involved in the formation of copper binuclear 
      species.

TI  - Yugoslav HD phenocopies analyzed on the presence of mutations in PrP, ferritin, 
      and Jp-3 genes.
PG  - 299-301
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a well-defined autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by CAG repeat expansions in HD gene. There are a significant 
      number of HD cases where this mutation was not found and such cases are named 
      HD-like phenotype (HDL). This article reports 48 patients with HDL phenotype. 
      Patients were analyzed on the presence of mutations in prion (PrP), ferritin and 
      junctophilin-3 (JP-3) genes. None of the patients showed the presence of the 
      mutation in analyzed genes. This could suggest that there is some other 
      gene/genes where the mutation can cause the disease with clinical features of HD.

TI  - Meta-analysis of gross insertions causing human genetic disease: novel mutational 
      mechanisms and the role of replication slippage.
PG  - 207-21
AB  - Although gross insertions (>20 bp) comprise <1% of disease-causing mutations, 
      they nevertheless represent an important category of pathological lesion. In an 
      attempt to study these insertions in a systematic way, 158 gross insertions 
      ranging in size between 21 bp and approximately 10 kb were identified using the 
      Human Gene Mutation Database (www.hgmd.org). A careful meta-analytical study 
      revealed extensive diversity in terms of the nature of the inserted DNA sequence 
      and has provided new insights into the underlying mutational mechanisms. Some 70% 
      of gross insertions were found to represent sequence duplications of different 
      types (tandem, partial tandem, or complex). Although most of the tandem 
      duplications were explicable by simple replication slippage, the three complex 
      duplications appear to result from multiple slippage events. Some 11% of gross 
      insertions were attributable to nonpolyglutamine repeat expansions (including 
      octapeptide repeat expansions in the prion protein gene [PRNP] and polyalanine 
      tract expansions) and evidence is presented to support the contention that these 
      mutations are also caused by replication slippage rather than by unequal crossing 
      over. Some 17% of gross insertions, all >or=276 bp in length, were found to be 
      due to LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition involving different types of element (L1 
      trans-driven Alu, L1 direct, and L1 trans-driven SVA). A second example of 
      pathological mitochondrial-nuclear sequence transfer was identified in the USH1C 
      gene but appears to arise via a novel mechanism, trans-replication slippage. 
      Finally, evidence for another novel mechanism of human genetic disease, involving 
      the possible capture of DNA oligonucleotides, is presented in the context of a 
      26-bp insertion into the ERCC6 gene.

TI  - A processed pseudogene contributes to apparent mule deer prion gene 
      heterogeneity.
PG  - 167-73
AB  - Pathogenesis and transmission of the prion disorders (transmissible spongiform 
      encephalopathies, TSEs) are mediated by a modified isoform of the prion protein 
      (PrP). Prion protein gene (PRNP) alleles associated with relative susceptibility 
      to TSE have been identified in sheep, humans and possibly elk. Comparable data 
      have not been derived for mule deer, a species susceptible to the TSE chronic 
      wasting disease (CWD). Initial analysis of the open reading frame (ORF) in exon 3 
      of the mule deer PRNP gene revealed polymorphisms in all 145 samples analyzed, 
      with 10 potential polymorphic sites. Because 144/145 (99.3%) of the samples were 
      heterozygous for a coding change (N/S) at codon 138 (bp 412) and a non-coding 
      polymorphism at bp 418, and individual deer with three or four different alleles 
      were identified a possible gene duplication was indicated. Analysis of BAC clones 
      containing mule deer PRNP genes revealed a full length functional gene and a 
      processed pseudogene. The pseudogene was characteristic of previously described 
      retroelements, in that it lacks introns and is flanked by repeat sequences. Three 
      alleles of the functional gene were identified, with coding changes only at 
      codons 20 (D/G) and 225 (S/F). Determination of PRNP functional gene alleles from 
      47 CWD-positive mule deer showed the predominant allele encoded 20D225S 
      (frequency 0.85). When alleles were grouped by coding changes in the functional 
      gene, four of the six possible peptide combinations were identified in infected 
      deer. Three pseudogene alleles with coding changes in exon 3 were identified in 
      the mule deer samples examined. Because the TSEs appear to be "protein only" 
      disorders, the presence of an untranslated pseudogene is not expected to affect 
      disease resistance. Therefore, selection of a genotyping method specific for the 
      functional gene is critical for large-scale studies to identify the role of the 
      PRNP gene in susceptibility to CWD in mule deer.

TI  - Huntington's disease-like phenotype due to trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 
      TBP and JPH3 genes.
PG  - 1599-603
AB  - We report a group of 252 patients with a Huntington's disease-like (HDL) 
      phenotype, including 60 with typical Huntington's disease, who had tested 
      negative for pathological expansions in the IT15 gene, the major mutation in 
      Huntington's disease. They were screened for repeat expansions in two other genes 
      involved in HDL phenotypes: those encoding the junctophilin-3 (JPH3/HDL2) and 
      prion (PRNP/HDL1) proteins. In addition, because of the clinical overlap between 
      patients with HDL disease and autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia or 
      dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), we investigated trinucleotide 
      repeat expansions in genes encoding the TATA-binding protein (TBP/SCA17) and 
      atrophin-1 (DRPLA). Two patients carried 43 and 50 uninterrupted CTG repeats in 
      the JPH3 gene. Two other patients had 44 and 46 CAA/CAG repeats in the TBP gene. 
      Patients with expansions in the TBP or JPH3 genes had HDL phenotypes 
      indistinguishable from Huntington's disease. Taking into account patients with 
      typical Huntington's disease, their frequencies were evaluated as 3% each in our 
      series of typical HDL patients. Interestingly, incomplete penetrance of the 46 
      CAA/CAG repeat in the TBP gene was observed in a 59-year-old transmitting, but 
      healthy, parent. Furthermore, we report a new configuration of the expanded TBP 
      allele, with 11 repeats on the first polymorphic stretch of CAGs. Expansions in 
      the DRPLA gene and insertions in the PRNP gene were not found in our group of 
      patients. Further genetic heterogeneity of the HDL phenotype therefore exists.

TI  - Molecular evolution of the mammalian prion protein.
PG  - 111-21
AB  - Prion protein (PrP) sequences are until now available for only six of the 18 
      orders of placental mammals. A broader comparison of mammalian prions might help 
      to understand the enigmatic functional and pathogenic properties of this protein. 
      We therefore determined PrP coding sequences in 26 mammalian species to include 
      all placental orders and major subordinal groups. Glycosylation sites, cysteines 
      forming a disulfide bridge, and a hydrophobic transmembrane region are perfectly 
      conserved. Also, the sequences responsible for secondary structure elements, for 
      N- and C-terminal processing of the precursor protein, and for attachment of the 
      glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol membrane anchor are well conserved. The N-terminal 
      region of PrP generally contains five or six repeats of the sequence 
      P(Q/H)GGG(G/-)WGQ, but alleles with two, four, and seven repeats were observed in 
      some species. This suggests, together with the pattern of amino acid replacements 
      in these repeats, the regular occurrence of repeat expansion and contraction. 
      Histidines implicated in copper ion binding and a proline involved in 
      4-hydroxylation are lacking in some species, which questions their importance for 
      normal functioning of cellular PrP. The finding in certain species of two or 
      seven repeats, and of amino acid substitutions that have been related to human 
      prion diseases, challenges the relevance of such mutations for prion pathology. 
      The gene tree deduced from the PrP sequences largely agrees with the species 
      tree, indicating that no major deviations occurred in the evolution of the prion 
      gene in different placental lineages. In one species, the anteater, a prion 
      pseudogene was present in addition to the active gene.

      deletion has not been observed in large, population-based studies, the two cases 
      suggest that this deletion is a new pathogenic mutation associated with CJD.

TI  - Huntington disease phenocopy is a familial prion disease.
PG  - 1385-8
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a common autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease 
      with early adult-onset motor abnormalities and dementia. Many studies of HD show 
      that huntingtin (CAG)n repeat-expansion length is a sensitive and specific marker 
      for HD. However, there are a significant number of examples of HD in the absence 
      of a huntingtin (CAG)n expansion, suggesting that mutations in other genes can 
      provoke HD-like disorders. The identification of genes responsible for these 
      "phenocopies" may greatly improve the reliability of genetic screens for HD and 
      may provide further insight into neurodegenerative disease. We have examined an 
      HD phenocopy pedigree with linkage to chromosome 20p12 for mutations in the prion 
      protein (PrP) gene (PRNP). This reveals that affected individuals are 
      heterozygous for a 192-nucleotide (nt) insertion within the PrP coding region, 
      which encodes an expanded PrP with eight extra octapeptide repeats. This reveals 
      that this HD phenocopy is, in fact, a familial prion disease and that PrP 
      repeat-expansion mutations can provoke an HD "genocopy." PrP repeat expansions 
      are well characterized and provoke early-onset, slowly progressive atypical prion 
      diseases with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and a remarkable range 
      of clinical features, many of which overlap with those of HD. This observation 
      raises the possibility that an unknown number of HD phenocopies are, in fact, 
      familial prion diseases and argues that clinicians should consider screening for 
      PrP mutations in individuals with HD-like diseases in which the characteristic HD 
      (CAG)n repeat expansions are absent.

PG  - Preprint 0006
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite decades of research, the agent responsible for transmitting 
      spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) has not been identified. The Prion hypothesis, 
      which dominates the field, supposes that modified host PrP protein, termed PrPSc, 
      acts as the transmissible agent. This model fits the observation that TSE 
      diseases elicit almost no immune reaction. Prion transmission has not been 
      verified, however, as it has not been possible to produce pure PrPSc aggregates. 
      One long-standing objection to the Prion model is the observation that TSE 
      disease agents show classical genetic behaviours, such as reproducible strain 
      variation, while also responding to selection for novel traits such as adaptation 
      to new hosts. Moreover, evidence has been steadily accumulating that infectious 
      titre is decoupled from the quantity (or even the presence) of PrPSc deposits. 
      Rather awkwardly for the Prion hypothesis, PrP0/0 knockout mice have been found 
      to incubate and transmit TSE agents (despite themselves being refractory to TSE 
      disease). HYPOTHESIS: In this article, a new scheme, RuNAway, is proposed whereby 
      uncontrolled proliferation of a type of parasitic gene, the small dispersed 
      repeat sequences (SINEs), in somatic cells induces overproduction of PrP with 
      pathogenic consequences. The RuNAway scheme involves twin tandem positive 
      feedback loops: triggering the second loop leads to the pathogenic disease. This 
      model is consistent with the long latency period and much shorter visible disease 
      progression typical of TSEs.

PG  - 250-5
AB  - We are currently interested in a group of proteins associated with the dementias 
      characterized by amyloid deposition in the brain: amyloid beta protein precursor 
      (A beta PP) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the abnormal isoform of prion protein 
      (PrP) of spongiform encephalopathies such as kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease 
      (CJD) and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSSD). Here we show that both A 
      beta PP and prion protein (PrP) consist of peculiar internal repeats and share 
      regions of sequence similarity. Further analysis revealed that local homology is 
      also shared with the other proteins involved in specific forms of 
      amyloidosis--i.e., the amyloid related proteins (ARP).

TI  - Oligopeptide-repeat expansions modulate 'protein-only' inheritance in yeast.
PG  - 573-6
AB  - The yeast [PSI+] element represents a new type of genetic inheritance, in which 
      changes in phenotype are transmitted by a 'protein only' mechanism reminiscent of 
      the 'protein-only' transmission of mammalian prion diseases. The underlying 
      molecular mechanisms for both are poorly understood and it is not clear how 
      similar they might be. Sup35, the [PSI+] protein determinant, and PrP, the 
      mammalian prion determinant, have different functions, different cellular 
      locations and no sequence similarity; however, each contains five imperfect 
      oligopeptide repeats-PQGGYQQYN in Sup35 and PHGGGWGQ in PrP. Repeat expansions in 
      PrP produce spontaneous prion diseases. Here we show that replacing the wild-type 
      SUP35 gene with a repeat-expansion mutation induces new [PSI+] elements, the 
      first mutation of its type among these newly described elements of inheritance. 
      In vitro, fully denatured repeat-expansion peptides can adopt conformations rich 
      in beta-sheets and form higher-order structures much more rapidly than wild-type 
      peptides. Our results provide insight into the nature of the conformational 
      changes underlying protein-based mechanisms of inheritance and suggest a link 
      between this process and those producing neurodegenerative prion diseases in 
      mammals.

TI  - The shortest known prion protein gene allele occurs in goats, has only three 
      octapeptide repeats and is non-pathogenic.
PG  - 3173-6
AB  - The prion protein (PrP) gene modulates the incidence and incubation periods of 
      transmissible spongiform encephalopathies of sheep, goats, mice and man. Here, a 
      new caprine PrP allele encoding the shortest naturally occurring PrP protein so 
      far described is reported. This variant contains only three instead of the usual 
      five copies of a short peptide repeat [Pro-Gln/His-Gly-Gly-Gly-(Gly)-TrpGly-Gln] 
      characteristic of PrP, with an additional Trp to Gly substitution in codon 102. 
      Fifteen out of 111 genotyped goats carried the novel PrP allele and 14 survived 
      without signs of disease for at least 4 years. One goat heterozygous for the 
      polymorphism was challenged experimentally with SSBP/1-scrapie and succumbed 
      after an unusually long incubation period.

TI  - APOE in non-Alzheimer amyloidoses: transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
PG  - 548-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: The APOE genotype has been shown to influence the risk of developing 
      sporadic and familial AD. This effect is isoform-dependent, the APOE epsilon4 
      allele increasing susceptibility and the APOE epsilon2 allele providing 
      protection. Amyloid formation is an important part of the pathogenesis in AD as 
      well as in spongiform encephalopathies; apoE deposition in amyloid plaques has 
      been documented in both conditions. METHODS: We examined the frequency of the 
      APOE alleles in patients with various forms of transmissible spongiform 
      encephalopathies, or prion diseases, including sporadic and iatrogenic 
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease associated with 
      PRNP 178N/129V and 200K/129M point mutations and a 24-nucleotide repeat 
      expansion; fatal familial insomnia caused by the 178N/129M mutation; 
      Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease associated with 102L/129M mutation; and 
      kuru. RESULTS: None of the groups we studied had a significant excess of APOE 
      epsilon4 allele when compared with appropriate controls. CONCLUSION: Our results 
      do not support the contention that the APOE epsilon4 allele is a risk factor for 
      developing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or related disorders.

TI  - Abnormal properties of prion protein with insertional mutations in different cell 
      types.
PG  - 11980-5
AB  - Inherited forms of the human transmissible spongiform encephalopathy 
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) have been associated with mutations in the normal 
      soluble, protease-sensitive form of the host prion protein (PrP-sen). Normal PrP 
      protein contains five copies of a repeating eight-amino acid region, and PrP 
      molecules with six or more copies of this region are associated with disease in 
      familial CJD. It has been hypothesized that these mutations might facilitate 
      spontaneous formation of the abnormal, aggregated protease-resistant PrP isoform, 
      PrP-res, associated with clinical CJD and other transmissible spongiform 
      encephalopathies (TSE). In the present experiments, hamster PrP molecules with 5 
      (wild-type), 7, 9, or 11 copies of this repeat region were generated and 
      expressed in mouse fibroblast cells or mouse neuroblastoma cells. In mouse 
      fibroblast cells, mutant hamster PrP molecules expressing 7, 9, and 11 copies of 
      the octapeptide repeat sequence showed altered cell surface expression, but both 
      mutant and wild-type hamster PrP-sen molecules demonstrated abnormal properties 
      of aggregation and increased protease resistance. By contrast in mouse 
      neuroblastoma cells, hamster PrP-sen with 5, 9, and 11 octapeptide repeats were 
      expressed normally on the cell surface, but only PrP-sen molecules with 9 or 11 
      copies of the repeat motif had abnormal properties of aggregation and increased 
      protease resistance. Overall, regardless of cell type, hamster PrP molecules with 
      greater than 7 octapeptide repeats were more aggregated and more 
      protease-resistant than molecules with 7 repeats or less. However, these abnormal 
      molecules were at least 1000-fold less protease-resistant than bona fide PrP-res 
      derived from TSE-infected brain tissue, and they showed no increased ability to 
      form PrP-res in a cell-free system.

PG  - 80-6
AB  - We describe an insert mutation in the prion protein (PrP) gene in a Japanese 
      family line that encodes six octapeptide repeats. This is the second report to 
      date of an inherited prion disease with a 144-base pair insertion, although the 
      order of the repeat sequences differ from that reported for the disease in an 
      English family line. The clinical features, like those of the English patients, 
      were characterized by a slowly progressive generalized dementia with some 
      neurological signs and cortical focal symptoms. Postmortem examination disclosed 
      diffuse atrophy of cerebral gray matter and the cerebellar cortex; 
      histologically, there were marked patchy and regional neuronal loss with 
      astrocytosis in the frontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus and 
      PrP-immunoreactive plaques in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. These 
      plaques were different from typical kuru plaques. The prion disease in the 
      present Japanese family line is compared with that in the English family line.

PG  - 314-26
AB  - Homogenized brain tissue from scrapie-infected hamsters and uninfected hamsters 
      was subjected to sub-cellular fractionation to isolate nemavirus. Nucleic acid 
      was extracted from these fractions, which also contained mitochondria. 
      Agarose-gel electrophoresis revealed a band corresponding to the size of circular 
      hamster mtDNA in both infected and uninfected samples, but slower migrating bands 
      were observed only in samples from scrapie-infected brain. A single band of ssDNA 
      corresponding to about 1.2 kb was purified by alkaline gel electrophoresis from 
      the nucleic acid content of the enriched preparations of nemavirus. The ssDNA was 
      synthesized into double-stranded DNA, cloned and sequenced. An unusual 
      palindromic six base TACGTA repeat sequence was observed suggesting that 1.2 kb 
      molecules consist of multiple copies of (TACGTA)n spaced along the length of the 
      ssDNA with a preceding sequence TATATA. The comparison of the nucleotide sequence 
      of the inserted DNA to the GenBank nucleotide database revealed no significant 
      homology to other sequences. A probe prepared from the Nar 50 clone was 
      hybridized against DNA prepared from scrapie, CJD, BSE and normal brains under 
      various salt and temperature conditions. The probe reacted with a band of about 
      1.2 kb in scrapie, CJD and BSE but not with control normal DNA specimens, thereby 
      confirming the presence of ssDNA in these SEs. The results suggest an intimate 
      association between the presence of nemavirus particles and scrapie, CJD and BSE.

TI  - A PrP gene codon 178 base substitution and a 24-bp interstitial deletion in 
      familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
PG  - 1864-70
AB  - Several mutations in the prion protein (PrP) gene are associated with familial 
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (FCJD). We describe a family in which five members in 
      three generations have had FCJD. The proband and some descendants of the affected 
      members carried an abnormal PrP gene allele. This allele contained a 24-bp 
      deletion from the tandem repeat region of the open reading frame and a codon 178 
      missense substitution. Observations suggest that the codon 178 mutation is 
      involved in the pathogenesis of FCJD in the family described here. The 24-bp 
      deletion may be an uncommon polymorphism.

TI  - Transmissible familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease associated with five, seven, and 
      eight extra octapeptide coding repeats in the PRNP gene.
PG  - 10926-30
AB  - The PRNP gene, encoding the amyloid precursor protein that is centrally involved 
      in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), has an unstable region of five variant tandem 
      octapeptide coding repeats between codons 51 and 91. We screened a total of 535 
      individuals for the presence of extra repeats in this region, including patients 
      with sporadic and familial forms of spongiform encephalopathy, members of their 
      families, other neurological and non-neurological patients, and normal controls. 
      We identified three CJD families (in each of which the proband's disease was 
      neuropathologically confirmed and experimentally transmitted to primates) that 
      were heterozygous for alleles with 10, 12, or 13 repeats, some of which had 
      "wobble" nucleotide substitutions. We also found one individual with 9 repeats 
      and no nucleotide substitutions who had no evidence of neurological disease. 
      These observations, together with data on published British patients with 11 and 
      14 repeats, strongly suggest that the occurrence of 10 or more octapeptide 
      repeats in the encoded amyloid precursor protein predisposes to CJD.

TI  - Stem loops in HIV and prion protein mRNAs.
PG  - 95-7
AB  - Tat-dependent trans-activation in HIV requires presentation of a CUGGG 
      pentanucleotide at the end of a stem loop within the tar site of the viral long 
      terminal repeat. A tandem repeat within the open reading frame of the prion 
      protein (PrP) mRNA is able to form similar stem loop structures with which the 
      HIV tat protein could interact, disturbing PrP translation. Self-amplification of 
      such a disturbance has been suggested as the cause of the scrapie group of 
      diseases, including the scrapie-like human dementiae. The same mechanism may 
      underly AIDS encephalopathy.
