AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal-dominant disorder caused 
      by an expanded pentanucleotide repeat in the ATXN10 gene. This repeat expansion, 
      when fully penetrant, has a size of 850-4,500 repeats. It has been shown that the 
      repeat composition can be a modifier of disease, e.g., seizures. Here, we 
      describe a Mexican kindred in which we identified both pure (ATTCT)(n) and mixed 
      (ATTCT)(n)-(ATTCC)(n) expansions in the same family. We used amplification-free 
      targeted sequencing and optical genome mapping to decipher the composition of 
      these repeat expansions. We found a considerable degree of mosaicism of the 
      repeat expansion. This mosaicism was confirmed in skin fibroblasts from 
      individuals with ATXN10 expansions with RNAScope in situ hybridization. All 
      affected family members with the mixed ATXN10 repeat expansion showed typical 
      clinical signs of spinocerebellar ataxia and epilepsy. In contrast, individuals 
      with the pure ATXN10 expansion present with Parkinson's disease or are 
      unaffected, even in individuals more than 20 years older than the average age at 
      onset for SCA10. Our findings suggest that the pure (ATTCT)(n) expansion is 
      non-pathogenic, while repeat interruptions, e.g., (ATTCC)(n), are necessary to 
      cause SCA10. This mechanism has been recently described for several other repeat 
      expansions including SCA31 (BEAN1), SCA37 (DAB1), and three loci for benign adult 
      familial myoclonic epilepsy BAFME (SAMD12, TNRC6A, RAPGEF2). Therefore, long-read 
      sequencing and optical genome mapping of the entire genomic structure of repeat 
      expansions are critical for clinical practice and genetic counseling, as 
      variations in the repeat can affect disease penetrance, symptoms, and disease 
      trajectory.

TI  - DNA analysis of benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy reveals associations 
      between the pathogenic TTTCA repeat insertion in SAMD12 and the nonpathogenic 
      TTTTA repeat expansion in TNRC6A.

AB  - Benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy (BAFME) is an autosomal dominant disease 
      characterized by adult-onset tremulous hand movement, myoclonus, and infrequent 
      epileptic seizures. Recently, intronic expansion of unstable TTTCA/TTTTA 
      pentanucleotide repeats in SAMD12, TNRC6A, or RAPGEF2 was identified as 
      pathological mutations in Japanese BAFME pedigrees. To confirm these mutations, 
      we performed a genetic analysis on 12 Japanese BAFME pedigrees. A total of 143 
      participants, including 43 familial patients, 5 suspected patients, 3 sporadic 
      nonfamilial patients, 22 unaffected familial members, and 70 unrelated controls, 
      were screened for expanded abnormal pentanucleotide repeats in SAMD12, TNRC6A, 
      RAPGEF2, YEAT2, MARCH6, and STARD7. DNA samples were analyzed using Southern 
      blotting, long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR), repeat-primed PCR, and 
      long-range PCR followed by Southern blotting. Of the 51 individuals with 
      clinically diagnosed or suspected BAFME, 49 carried a SAMD12 allele with an 
      expanded TTTCA/TTTTA pentanucleotide repeat. Genetic and clinical anticipation 
      was observed. As in previous reports, the one patient with homozygous mutant 
      alleles showed more severe symptoms than the heterozygous carriers. In addition, 
      screening for expanded pentanucleotide repeats in TNRC6A revealed that the 
      frequency of expanded TTTTA repeat alleles in the BAFME group was significantly 
      higher than in the control group. All patients who were clinically diagnosed with 
      BAFME, including those in the original family reported by Yasuda, carried 
      abnormally expanded TTTCA/TTTTA repeat alleles of SAMD12. Patients with BAFME 
      also frequently carried a TTTTA repeat expansion in TNRC6A, suggesting that there 
      may be unknown factors in the ancestry of patients with BAFME that make 
      pentanucleotide repeats unstable.

TI  - Intronic (TTTGA)(n) insertion in SAMD12 also causes familial cortical myoclonic 
      tremor with epilepsy.
PG  - 1571-1576

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intronic (TTTCA)(n) insertions in the SAMD12, TNRC6A, and RAPGEF2 
      genes have been identified as causes of familial cortical myoclonic tremor with 
      epilepsy. OBJECTIVE: To identify the cause of familial cortical myoclonic tremor 
      with epilepsy pedigrees without (TTTCA)(n) insertions in SAMD12, TNRC6A, and 
      RAPGEF2. METHODS: Repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction, long-range polymerase 
      chain reaction, and Sanger sequencing were performed to identify the existence of 
      a novel (TTTGA)(n) insertion. Targeted long-read sequencing was performed to 
      confirm the accurate structure of the (TTTGA)(n) insertion. RESULTS: We 
      identified a novel expanded intronic (TTTGA)(n) insertion at the same site as the 
      previously reported (TTTCA)(n) insertion in SAMD12. This insertion cosegregated 
      with familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy in 1 Chinese pedigree with 
      no (TTTCA)(n) insertion. In the targeted long-read sequencing of 2 patients and 1 
      asymptomatic carrier in this pedigree, with 1 previously reported (TTTCA)(n) 
      -insertion-carrying patient as a positive control, a respective total of 302, 
      159, 207, and 50 on-target subreads (predicated accuracy: >/=90%) spanning the 
      target repeat expansion region were generated. These sequencing data revealed the 
      accurate repeat expansion structures as (TTTTA)(114-123) (TTTGA)(108-116) in the 
      pedigree and (TTTTA)(38) (TTTCA)(479) in (TTTCA)(n) -insertion-carrying patient. 
      CONCLUSION: The targeted long-read sequencing helped us to elucidate the accurate 
      structures of the (TTTGA)(n) and (TTTCA)(n) insertions. Our finding offers a 
      novel possible cause for familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy and 
      might shed light on the identification of genetic causes of this disease in 
      pedigrees with no detected (TTTCA)(n) insertion in the reported causative genes.

TI  - TTTCA repeat expansion causes familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy.
PG  - 513-518
LID - 10.1111/ene.13848 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim was to investigate whether abnormal TTTTA and 
      TTTCA repeat expansions in introns of SAMD12, TNRC6A and RAPGEF2 are involved in 
      the pathogenesis of familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy (FCMTE). 
      METHODS: Five families diagnosed with FCMTE were included in the current genetic 
      analysis. Whole-exome sequencing was performed in selected patients of each 
      family. TTTTA and TTTCA expansions were examined by repeat-primed 
      polymerase chain reaction. The clinical features of FCMTE were elicited as 
      defined by the common genetic mechanism of 14 patients. RESULTS: Abnormal TTTCA 
      expansion was identified and co-segregated in all five FCMTE families, four 
      inserted in SAMD12 and one in RAPGEF2. The insertion of expanded TTTCA was not 
      found in 116 control alleles. TTTTA expansion in SAMD12 was detected in 90.9% 
      (10/11) of patients or mutation carriers; TTTTA expansion in RAPGEF2 was not 
      found. The onset age of myoclonic tremor was 27.4 +/- 5.9 (19-37) and epilepsy 
      usually presented around age 34. Focal and generalized seizures were witnessed 
      with various origins recorded by electroencephalogram. Cognitive deficits were 
      not common within the first 3 years after epilepsy onset. Emotional instability 
      was reported by most patients. No patients showed any cerebellar deficits. 
      Valproate added with clonazepam is effective in controlling seizures but cannot 
      guarantee a complete remission of tremor. Repeat length showed intergenerational 
      instability and was inversely correlated with age at onset of myoclonic tremor 
      and epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: TTTCA expansion insertion is associated with FCMTE in 
      Chinese families. The homogenous genetic mechanism allowed for a higher precision 
      of FCMTE description.

TI  - Expansions of intronic TTTCA and TTTTA repeats in benign adult familial myoclonic 
      epilepsy.

AB  - Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, and mutations in genes encoding ion 
      channels or neurotransmitter receptors are frequent causes of monogenic forms of 
      epilepsy. Here we show that abnormal expansions of TTTCA and TTTTA repeats in 
      intron 4 of SAMD12 cause benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy (BAFME). 
      Single-molecule, real-time sequencing of BAC clones and nanopore sequencing of 
      genomic DNA identified two repeat configurations in SAMD12. Intriguingly, in two 
      families with a clinical diagnosis of BAFME in which no repeat expansions in 
      SAMD12 were observed, we identified similar expansions of TTTCA and TTTTA repeats 
      in introns of TNRC6A and RAPGEF2, indicating that expansions of the same repeat 
      motifs are involved in the pathogenesis of BAFME regardless of the genes in which 
      the expanded repeats are located. This discovery that expansions of noncoding 
      repeats lead to neuronal dysfunction responsible for myoclonic tremor and 
      epilepsy extends the understanding of diseases with such repeat expansion.

TI  - Mechanism of allele-selective inhibition of huntingtin expression by duplex RNAs 
      that target CAG repeats: function through the RNAi pathway.
PG  - 11270-80
LID - 10.1093/nar/gks907 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat within one allele of the huntingtin (HTT) 
      gene. Agents that block expression of mutant HTT and preserve expression of 
      wild-type HTT target the cause of the disease and are an alternative for therapy. 
      We have previously demonstrated that mismatch-containing duplex RNAs 
      complementary to the expanded trinucleotide repeat are potent and 
      allele-selective inhibitors of mutant HTT expression, but the mechanism of allele 
      selectivity was not explored. We now report that anti-CAG duplex RNA 
      preferentially recruits argonaute 2 (AGO2) to mutant rather than wild-type HTT 
      mRNA. Efficient inhibition of mutant HTT protein expression requires less AGO2 
      than needed for inhibiting wild-type expression. In contrast, inhibiting the 
      expression of mutant HTT protein is highly sensitive to reduced expression of 
      GW182 (TNRC6A) and its two paralogs, a protein family associated with miRNA 
      action. Allele-selective inhibition may involve cooperative binding of multiple 
      protein-RNA complexes to the expanded repeat. These data suggest that 
      allele-selective inhibition proceeds through an RNA interference pathway similar 
      to that used by miRNAs and that discrimination between mutant and wild-type 
      alleles of HTT mRNA is highly sensitive to the pool of AGO2 and GW182 family 
      proteins inside cells.
