TI  - Identification and Copy Number Variant Analysis of Enhancer Regions of Genes 
      Causing Spinocerebellar Ataxia.
LID - 10.3390/ijms252011205 [doi]
LID - 11205
AB  - Currently, routine diagnostics for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) look for polyQ 
      repeat expansions and conventional variations affecting the proteins encoded by 
      known SCA genes. However, ~40% of the patients still remain without a genetic 
      diagnosis after routine tests. Increasing evidence suggests that variations in 
      the enhancer regions of genes involved in neurodegenerative disorders can also 
      cause disease. Since the enhancers of SCA genes are not yet known, it remains to 
      be determined whether variations in these regions are a cause of SCA. In this 
      pilot project, we aimed to identify the enhancers of the SCA genes ATXN1, ATXN3, 
      TBP and ITPR1 in the human cerebellum using 4C-seq, publicly available datasets, 
      reciprocal 4C-seq, and luciferase assays. We then screened these enhancers for 
      copy number variants (CNVs) in a cohort of genetically undiagnosed SCA patients. 
      We identified two active enhancers for each of the four SCA genes. CNV analysis 
      did not reveal any CNVs in the enhancers of the four SCA genes in the genetically 
      undiagnosed SCA patients. However, in one patient, we noted a CNV deletion with 
      an unknown clinical significance near one of the ITPR1 enhancers. These results 
      not only reveal elements involved in SCA gene regulation but can also lead to the 
      discovery of novel SCA-causing genetic variants. As enhancer variations are being 
      increasingly recognized as a cause of brain disorders, screening the enhancers of 
      ATXN1, ATXN3, TBP and ITPR1 for variations other than CNVs and identifying and 
      screening enhancers of other SCA genes might elucidate the genetic cause in 
      undiagnosed patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, is a rare neurodegenerative disorder 
      with autosomal dominant inheritance belonging to the polyglutamine diseases. The 
      diagnosis of this disease requires genetic testing that may also include the 
      search for CAT interruption of the CAG repeat tract. CASE PRESENTATION: One 
      23-years-old patient suffers from a severe ataxia, with early-onset and rapid 
      progression of the disease. His father might have been affected, but no molecular 
      confirmation has been performed. The genetic results were negative for the 
      Friedreich's ataxia, spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, 3, 6, 7 and 17. The numbers 
      of CAG repeats in the ATXN1 gene was assessed by fluorescent PCR, tripled-primed 
      PCR and enzymatic digestion for the search of sequence interruption in the CAG 
      repeats. The patient carried one pathogenic allele of 61 CAG and one intermediate 
      allele of 37 CAG in the ATXN1 gene. Both alleles were uninterrupted. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We report a rare case of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 with an intermediate 
      allele and a large SCA1 expansion. The determination of the absence of CAT 
      interruption brought crucial information concerning this molecular diagnosis, the 
      prediction of the disease and had practical consequences for genetic counseling.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a genetically heterogenous group of 
      devastating neurodegenerative conditions for which clinical care currently 
      focuses on managing symptoms. Across these diseases there is an unmet need for 
      therapies that address underlying disease mechanisms. We utilised the shared CAG 
      repeat expansion mutation causative for a large subgroup of SCAs, to develop a 
      novel disease-gene independent and mechanism agnostic small molecule screening 
      approach to identify compounds with therapeutic potential across multiple SCAs. 
      Using this approach, we identified the FDA approved microtubule inhibitor 
      Colchicine and a novel CAG-repeat binding compound that reduce expression of 
      disease associated transcripts across SCA1, 3 and 7 patient derived fibroblast 
      lines and the Atxn1 (154Q/2Q) SCA1 mouse model in a repeat selective manner. 
      Furthermore, our lead candidate rescues dysregulated alternative splicing in 
      Atxn1 (154Q/2Q) mice. This work provides the first example of small molecules 
      capable of targeting the underlying mechanism of disease across multiple CAG 
      SCAs.

AB  - There is an obvious clinical-pathological overlap between essential tremor and 
      some known tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansion disorders. The aim is 
      to analyse whether these short tandem repeat genes, including ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, TBP, BEAN1, NOP56, DAB1, ATN1, 
      SADM12 and FMR1, are associated with familial essential tremor patients. Genetic 
      analysis of repeat sizes in tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansions was 
      performed in a large cohort of 515 familial essential tremor probands and 300 
      controls. The demographic and clinical features among carriers of pathogenic 
      expansions, intermediate repeats and non-carriers were compared. A total of 18 
      out of 515 (18/515, 3.7%) patients were found to have repeats expansions, 
      including 12 cases (12/515, 2.5%) with intermediate repeat expansions (one ATXN1, 
      eight TBP, two FMR1, one ATN1), and six cases (6/515, 1.2%) with pathogenic 
      expansions (one ATXN1, one ATXN2, one ATXN8OS, one PPP2R2B, one FMR1, one 
      SAMD12). There were no statistically significant differences in intermediate 
      repeats compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, there were no significant 
      differences in demographics and clinical features among individuals with 
      pathogenic expansions, intermediate repeat expansions carriers and non-carriers. 
      Our study indicates that the intermediate repeat expansion in tremor-associated 
      short tandem repeat expansions does not pose an increased risk for essential 
      tremor, and rare pathogenic expansion carriers have been found in the familial 
      essential tremor cohort. The diagnosis of essential tremor based solely on 
      clinical symptoms remains a challenge in distinguishing it from known short 
      tandem repeat expansions diseases with overlapping clinical-pathological 
      features.

AB  - Expanded CAG repeats in coding regions of different genes are the most common 
      cause of dominantly inherited spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). These repeats are 
      unstable through the germline, and larger repeats lead to earlier onset. We 
      measured somatic expansion in blood samples collected from 30 SCA1, 50 SCA2, 74 
      SCA3, and 30 SCA7 individuals over a mean interval of 8.5 years, along with 
      postmortem tissues and fetal tissues from SCA1, SCA3, and SCA7 individuals to 
      examine somatic expansion at different stages of life. We showed that somatic 
      mosaicism in the blood increases over time. Expansion levels are significantly 
      different among SCAs and correlate with CAG repeat lengths. The level of 
      expansion is greater in individuals with SCA7 who manifest disease compared to 
      that of those who do not yet display symptoms. Brain tissues from SCA individuals 
      have larger expansions compared to the blood. The cerebellum has the lowest 
      mosaicism among the studied brain regions, along with a high expression of ATXNs 
      and DNA repair genes. This was the opposite in cortices, with the highest 
      mosaicism and lower expression of ATXNs and DNA repair genes. Fetal cortices did 
      not show repeat instability. This study shows that CAG repeats are increasingly 
      unstable during life in the blood and the brain of SCA individuals, with gene- 
      and tissue-specific patterns.

AB  - Genetic repeat expansions cause neuronal degeneration in amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis as well as other neurodegenerative disorders such as spinocerebellar 
      ataxia, Huntington's disease and Kennedy's disease. Repeat expansions in the same 
      gene can cause multiple clinical phenotypes. We aimed to characterize repeat 
      expansions in a Norwegian amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cohort. Norwegian 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (n = 414) and neurologically healthy 
      controls adjusted for age and gender (n = 713) were investigated for repeat 
      expansions in AR, ATXN1, ATXN2 and HTT using short read exome sequencing and the 
      ExpansionHunter software. Five amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (1.2%) and 
      two controls (0.3%) carried >/=36 repeats in HTT (P = 0.032), and seven amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis patients (1.7%) and three controls (0.4%) carried >/=29 repeats 
      in ATXN2 (P = 0.038). One male diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      carried a pathogenic repeat expansion in AR, and his diagnosis was revised to 
      Kennedy's disease. In ATXN1, 50 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (12.1%) 
      and 96 controls (13.5%) carried >/=33 repeats (P = 0.753). None of the patients 
      with repeat expansions in ATXN2 or HTT had signs of Huntington's disease or 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, based on a re-evaluation of medical records. The 
      diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was confirmed in all patients, with 
      the exception of one patient who had primary lateral sclerosis. Our findings 
      indicate that repeat expansions in HTT and ATXN2 are associated with increased 
      likelihood of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Further studies are 
      required to investigate the potential relationship between HTT repeat expansions 
      and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

AB  - To date, approximately 50 short tandem repeat (STR) disorders have been 
      identified; yet, clinical laboratories rarely conduct STR analysis on exomes. To 
      assess its diagnostic value, we analyzed STRs in 6099 exomes from 2510 families 
      with mostly suspected neurogenetic disorders. We employed ExpansionHunter and 
      REViewer to detect pathogenic repeat expansions, confirming them using orthogonal 
      methods. Genotype-phenotype correlations led to the diagnosis of thirteen 
      individuals in seven previously undiagnosed families, identifying three autosomal 
      dominant disorders: dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (n = 3), spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 7 (n = 2), and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (n = 2), resulting in a 
      diagnostic gain of 0.28% (7/2510). Additionally, we found expanded ATXN1 alleles 
      (>/=39 repeats) with varying patterns of CAT interruptions in twelve individuals, 
      accounting for approximately 0.19% in the Korean population. Our study 
      underscores the importance of integrating STR analysis into exome sequencing 
      pipeline, broadening the application of exome sequencing for STR assessments.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat expansion in the ATXN1 gene. It is 
      characterized by the presence of polyglutamine (polyQ) intranuclear inclusion 
      bodies (IIBs) within affected neurons. In order to investigate the impact of 
      polyQ IIBs in SCA1 pathogenesis, we generated a novel protein aggregation model 
      by inducible overexpression of the mutant ATXN1(Q82) isoform in human 
      neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, we developed a simple and reproducible 
      protocol for the efficient isolation of insoluble IIBs. Biophysical 
      characterization showed that polyQ IIBs are enriched in RNA molecules which were 
      further identified by next-generation sequencing. Finally, a protein interaction 
      network analysis indicated that sequestration of essential RNA transcripts within 
      ATXN1(Q82) IIBs may affect the ribosome resulting in error-prone protein 
      synthesis and global proteome instability. These findings provide novel insights 
      into the molecular pathogenesis of SCA1, highlighting the role of polyQ IIBs and 
      their impact on critical cellular processes.

AB  - Expansions of repeat DNA tracts cause >70 diseases, and ongoing expansions in 
      brains exacerbate disease. During expansion mutations, single-stranded DNAs 
      (ssDNAs) form slipped-DNAs. We find the ssDNA-binding complexes canonical 
      replication protein A (RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3) and Alternative-RPA (RPA1, RPA3, and 
      primate-specific RPA4) are upregulated in Huntington disease and spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 1 (SCA1) patient brains. Protein interactomes of RPA and Alt-RPA 
      reveal unique and shared partners, including modifiers of CAG instability and 
      disease presentation. RPA enhances in vitro melting, FAN1 excision, and repair of 
      slipped-CAGs and protects against CAG expansions in human cells. RPA 
      overexpression in SCA1 mouse brains ablates expansions, coincident with decreased 
      ATXN1 aggregation, reduced brain DNA damage, improved neuron morphology, and 
      rescued motor phenotypes. In contrast, Alt-RPA inhibits melting, FAN1 excision, 
      and repair of slipped-CAGs and promotes CAG expansions. These findings suggest a 
      functional interplay between the two RPAs where Alt-RPA may antagonistically 
      offset RPA's suppression of disease-associated repeat expansions, which may 
      extend to other DNA processes.

TI  - Widespread alternative splicing dysregulation occurs presymptomatically in CAG 
      expansion spinocerebellar ataxias.
PG  - 486-504
LID - 10.1093/brain/awad329 [doi]
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative diseases, several of which are caused by CAG expansion 
      mutations (SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 12) and more broadly belong to the large family 
      of over 40 microsatellite expansion diseases. While dysregulation of alternative 
      splicing is a well defined driver of disease pathogenesis across several 
      microsatellite diseases, the contribution of alternative splicing in CAG 
      expansion SCAs is poorly understood. Furthermore, despite extensive studies on 
      differential gene expression, there remains a gap in our understanding of 
      presymptomatic transcriptomic drivers of disease. We sought to address these 
      knowledge gaps through a comprehensive study of 29 publicly available 
      RNA-sequencing datasets. We identified that dysregulation of alternative splicing 
      is widespread across CAG expansion mouse models of SCAs 1, 3 and 7. These changes 
      were detected presymptomatically, persisted throughout disease progression, were 
      repeat length-dependent, and were present in brain regions implicated in SCA 
      pathogenesis including the cerebellum, pons and medulla. Across disease 
      progression, changes in alternative splicing occurred in genes that function in 
      pathways and processes known to be impaired in SCAs, such as ion channels, 
      synaptic signalling, transcriptional regulation and the cytoskeleton. We 
      validated several key alternative splicing events with known functional 
      consequences, including Trpc3 exon 9 and Kcnma1 exon 23b, in the Atxn1154Q/2Q 
      mouse model. Finally, we demonstrated that alternative splicing dysregulation is 
      responsive to therapeutic intervention in CAG expansion SCAs with Atxn1 targeting 
      antisense oligonucleotide rescuing key splicing events. Taken together, these 
      data demonstrate that widespread presymptomatic dysregulation of alternative 
      splicing in CAG expansion SCAs may contribute to disease onset, early neuronal 
      dysfunction and may represent novel biomarkers across this devastating group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - There are more than 40 types of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), most of which are 
      caused by abnormal expansion of short tandem repeats at various gene loci. These 
      phenotypically similar disorders require molecular testing at multiple loci by 
      fluorescent PCR and capillary electrophoresis to identify the causative repeat 
      expansion. We describe a simple strategy to screen for the more common SCA1, 
      SCA2, and SCA3 by rapidly detecting the abnormal CAG repeat expansion at the 
      ATXN1, ATXN2, and ATXN3 loci using melting curve analysis of triplet-primed PCR 
      products. Each of the three separate assays employs a plasmid DNA carrying a 
      known repeat size to generate a threshold melt peak temperature, which 
      effectively distinguishes expansion-positive samples from those without a repeat 
      expansion. Samples that are screened positive based on their melt peak profiles 
      are subjected to capillary electrophoresis for repeat sizing and genotype 
      confirmation. These screening assays are robust and provide accurate detection of 
      the repeat expansion while eliminating the need for fluorescent PCR and capillary 
      electrophoresis for every sample.

AB  - Pathogenic short tandem repeat (STR) expansions cause over 20 neurodegenerative 
      diseases. To determine the contribution of STRs in sporadic amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), we used ExpansionHunter, 
      REviewer, and polymerase chain reaction validation to assess 21 neurodegenerative 
      disease-associated STRs in whole-genome sequencing data from 608 patients with 
      sporadic ALS, 68 patients with sporadic FTD, and 4703 matched controls. We also 
      propose a data-derived outlier detection method for defining allele thresholds in 
      rare STRs. Excluding C9orf72 repeat expansions, 17.6% of clinically diagnosed ALS 
      and FTD cases had at least one expanded STR allele reported to be pathogenic or 
      intermediate for another neurodegenerative disease. We identified and validated 
      162 disease-relevant STR expansions in C9orf72 (ALS/FTD), ATXN1 [spinal 
      cerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1)], ATXN2 (SCA2), ATXN8 (SCA8), TBP (SCA17), HTT 
      (Huntington's disease), DMPK [myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)], CNBP (DM2), and 
      FMR1 (fragile-X disorders). Our findings suggest clinical and pathological 
      pleiotropy of neurodegenerative disease genes and highlight their importance in 
      ALS and FTD.

TI  - Genetic variability in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
PG  - 3760-3769
LID - 10.1093/brain/awad120 [doi]
AB  - With the advent of gene therapies for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), there 
      is a surge in gene testing for this disease. Although there is ample experience 
      with gene testing for C9orf72, SOD1, FUS and TARDBP in familial ALS, large 
      studies exploring genetic variation in all ALS-associated genes in sporadic ALS 
      (sALS) are still scarce. Gene testing in a diagnostic setting is challenging, 
      given the complex genetic architecture of sALS, for which there are genetic 
      variants with large and small effect sizes. Guidelines for the interpretation of 
      genetic variants in gene panels and for counselling of patients are lacking. We 
      aimed to provide a thorough characterization of genetic variability in ALS genes 
      by applying the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria 
      on whole genome sequencing data from a large cohort of 6013 sporadic ALS patients 
      and 2411 matched controls from Project MinE. We studied genetic variation in 90 
      ALS-associated genes and applied customized ACMG-criteria to identify pathogenic 
      and likely pathogenic variants. Variants of unknown significance were collected 
      as well. In addition, we determined the length of repeat expansions in C9orf72, 
      ATXN1, ATXN2 and NIPA1 using the ExpansionHunter tool. We found C9orf72 repeat 
      expansions in 5.21% of sALS patients. In 50 ALS-associated genes, we did not 
      identify any pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. In 5.89%, a pathogenic or 
      likely pathogenic variant was found, most commonly in SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, NEK1, 
      OPTN or TBK1. Significantly more cases carried at least one pathogenic or likely 
      pathogenic variant compared to controls (odds ratio 1.75; P-value 1.64 x 10-5). 
      Isolated risk factors in ATXN1, ATXN2, NIPA1 and/or UNC13A were detected in 
      17.33% of cases. In 71.83%, we did not find any genetic clues. A combination of 
      variants was found in 2.88%. This study provides an inventory of pathogenic and 
      likely pathogenic genetic variation in a large cohort of sALS patients. Overall, 
      we identified pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in 11.13% of ALS patients 
      in 38 known ALS genes. In line with the oligogenic hypothesis, we found 
      significantly more combinations of variants in cases compared to controls. Many 
      variants of unknown significance may contribute to ALS risk, but diagnostic 
      algorithms to reliably identify and weigh them are lacking. This work can serve 
      as a resource for counselling and for the assembly of gene panels for ALS. 
      Further characterization of the genetic architecture of sALS is necessary given 
      the growing interest in gene testing in ALS.

TI  - Fast and reliable detection of repeat expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia using 
      exomes.

AB  - Usually, molecular diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia is based on a step-by-step 
      approach with targeted sizing of four repeat expansions accounting for most 
      dominant cases, then targeted sequencing of other genes. Nowadays, genome 
      sequencing allows detection of most pathogenic variants in a single step. The 
      ExpansionHunter tool can detect expansions in short-read genome sequencing data. 
      Recent studies have shown that ExpansionHunter can also be used to identify 
      repeat expansions in exome sequencing data. We tested ExpansionHunter on 
      spinocerebellar ataxia exomes in a research context as a second-line analysis, 
      after exclusion of main CAG repeat expansions in half of the probands. First, we 
      confirmed the detection of expansions in seven known expansion carriers and then, 
      after targeted analysis of ATXN1, 2, 3 and 7, CACNA1A, TBP, ATN1, NOP56, AR and 
      HTT in 498 exomes, we found 22 additional pathogenic expansions. Comparison with 
      capillary migration sizing in 247 individuals and confirmation of all expanded 
      alleles detected by ExpansionHunter demonstrated that for these loci, sensitivity 
      and specificity reached 100%. ExpansionHunter detected but underestimated the 
      repeat size for larger expansions, and the normal alleles distribution at each 
      locus should be taken into account to detect expansions. Exome combined with 
      ExpansionHunter is reliable to detect repeat expansions in selected loci as 
      first-line analysis in spinocerebellar ataxia.

AB  - Genetic risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is highly elevated in 
      genetic isolates, like the island population of Malta in the south of Europe, 
      providing a unique opportunity to investigate the genetics of this disease. Here 
      we characterize the clinical phenotype and genetic profile of the largest series 
      of Maltese ALS patients to date identified throughout a 5-year window. Cases and 
      controls underwent neuromuscular assessment and analysis of rare variants in ALS 
      causative or risk genes following whole-genome sequencing. Potentially damaging 
      variants or repeat expansions were identified in more than 45% of all patients. 
      The most commonly affected genes were ALS2, DAO, SETX and SPG11, an infrequent 
      cause of ALS in Europeans. We also confirmed a significant association between 
      ATXN1 intermediate repeats and increased disease risk. Damaging variants in major 
      ALS genes C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP and FUS were however either absent or rare in 
      Maltese ALS patients. Overall, our study underscores a population that is an 
      outlier within Europe and one that represents a high percentage of genetically 
      explained cases.

LID - 3323
AB  - While astrocyte heterogeneity is an important feature of the healthy brain, less 
      is understood about spatiotemporal heterogeneity of astrocytes in brain disease. 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene Ataxin1 (ATXN1). We characterized 
      astrocytes across disease progression in the four clinically relevant brain 
      regions, cerebellum, brainstem, hippocampus, and motor cortex, of Atxn1(154Q/2Q) 
      mice, a knock-in mouse model of SCA1. We found brain region-specific changes in 
      astrocyte density and GFAP expression and area, early in the disease and prior to 
      neuronal loss. Expression of astrocytic core homeostatic genes was also altered 
      in a brain region-specific manner and correlated with neuronal activity, 
      indicating that astrocytes may compensate or exacerbate neuronal dysfunction. 
      Late in disease, expression of astrocytic homeostatic genes was reduced in all 
      four brain regions, indicating loss of astrocyte functions. We observed no 
      obvious correlation between spatiotemporal changes in microglia and 
      spatiotemporal astrocyte alterations, indicating a complex orchestration of glial 
      phenotypes in disease. These results support spatiotemporal diversity of glial 
      phenotypes as an important feature of the brain disease that may contribute to 
      SCA1 pathogenesis in a brain region and disease stage-specific manner.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating, heterogeneous 
      neurodegenerative neuromuscular disease that leads to a fatal outcome within 
      2-5 years, and yet, a precise nature of the association between its major 
      phenotypes and the cerebellar role in ALS pathology remains unknown. Recently, 
      repeat expansions in several genes in which variants appreciably contribute to 
      cerebellar pathology, including C9orf72, NIPA1, ATXN2 and ATXN1, have been found 
      to confer a significant risk for ALS. To better define this relationship, we 
      performed MAGMA gene-based analysis and tissue enrichment analysis using 
      genome-wide association study summary statistics based on a study of 27,205 
      people with ALS and 110,881 controls. Our preliminary results imply a striking 
      cerebellar tissue specificity and further support increasing calls for 
      re-evaluation of the cerebellar role in the ALS pathology.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by a (CAG) repeat expansion in the coding sequence of ATXN1. The 
      primary mechanism of disease in SCA1 is toxic gain of function by 
      polyglutamine-expanded mutant ATXN1 and is compounded by partial loss of 
      wild-type function. Addressing both disease mechanisms, we have shown that 
      virally expressed RNA interference targeting ATXN1 can both prevent and reverse 
      disease phenotypes in SCA1 mice, and that overexpression of the ATXN1 homolog, 
      ataxin 1-like (ATXN1L), improves disease readouts when delivered 
      pre-symptomatically. Here, we combined these therapeutic approaches into two, 
      dual component recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors and tested their 
      ability to reverse disease in symptomatic SCA1 mice using behavior, pathological, 
      and next-generation sequencing assays. Mice treated with vectors expressing human 
      ATXN1L (hATXN1L) alone showed motor improvements and changes in gene expression 
      that reflected increases in pro-development pathways. When hATN1L was combined 
      with miS1, a previously validated microRNA targeting h ATXN1, there was added 
      normalization of disease allele-induced changes in gene expression along with 
      motor improvements. Our data show the additive nature of this two-component 
      approach for a more effective SCA1 therapy.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a presently incurable neurodegenerative 
      disease. Some genes have a causal relationship to ALS, others act as 
      susceptibility and/or risk factors. We aimed to elucidate the role of 14 
      ALS-related genes in the Hungarian ALS population of 183 patients. Mutation 
      screening of major ALS genes was performed. SMN1 and SMN2 genes were examined by 
      multiplex ligation-dependent probe-amplification assay; intermediate repeat 
      expansions in the ATXN1 and ATXN2 genes were analyzed by fragment analysis. 
      Additional variants in putative ALS genes were screened from previously acquired 
      next generation sequencing data. We confirmed the repeat expansion of the 
      C9orf72, ATXN1 and ATXN2 genes as ALS risk factors in this Hungarian cohort. 
      Additionally, we identified a pathogenic SOD1 mutation and suggested its founder 
      effect. A likely pathogenic variant in the MFSD8 gene was detected, and variants 
      of interest were uncovered in the ANXA11 and GLT8D1 genes. We provide valuable 
      data as part of the growing body of work on population-specific aspects of the 
      genetic background of ALS.

TI  - Whole genome sequencing for the diagnosis of neurological repeat expansion 
      disorders in the UK: a retrospective diagnostic accuracy and prospective clinical 
      validation study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansion disorders affect about 1 in 3000 individuals and are 
      clinically heterogeneous diseases caused by expansions of short tandem DNA 
      repeats. Genetic testing is often locus-specific, resulting in underdiagnosis of 
      people who have atypical clinical presentations, especially in paediatric 
      patients without a previous positive family history. Whole genome sequencing is 
      increasingly used as a first-line test for other rare genetic disorders, and we 
      aimed to assess its performance in the diagnosis of patients with neurological 
      repeat expansion disorders. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic 
      accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect the most common repeat expansion 
      loci associated with neurological outcomes (AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, 
      C9orf72, CACNA1A, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, and TBP) using samples obtained within 
      the National Health Service in England from patients who were suspected of having 
      neurological disorders; previous PCR test results were used as the reference 
      standard. The clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat 
      expansions was prospectively examined in previously genetically tested and 
      undiagnosed patients recruited in 2013-17 to the 100 000 Genomes Project in the 
      UK, who were suspected of having a genetic neurological disorder (familial or 
      early-onset forms of ataxia, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, dementia, motor 
      neuron disease, parkinsonian movement disorders, intellectual disability, or 
      neuromuscular disorders). If a repeat expansion call was made using whole genome 
      sequencing, PCR was used to confirm the result. FINDINGS: The diagnostic accuracy 
      of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat expansions was evaluated against 793 
      PCR tests previously performed within the NHS from 404 patients. Whole genome 
      sequencing correctly classified 215 of 221 expanded alleles and 1316 of 1321 
      non-expanded alleles, showing 97.3% sensitivity (95% CI 94.2-99.0) and 99.6% 
      specificity (99.1-99.9) across the 13 disease-associated loci when compared with 
      PCR test results. In samples from 11 631 patients in the 100 000 Genomes Project, 
      whole genome sequencing identified 81 repeat expansions, which were also tested 
      by PCR: 68 were confirmed as repeat expansions in the full pathogenic range, 11 
      were non-pathogenic intermediate expansions or premutations, and two were 
      non-expanded repeats (16% false discovery rate). INTERPRETATION: In our study, 
      whole genome sequencing for the detection of repeat expansions showed high 
      sensitivity and specificity, and it led to identification of neurological repeat 
      expansion disorders in previously undiagnosed patients. These findings support 
      implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical laboratories for diagnosis 
      of patients who have a neurological presentation consistent with a repeat 
      expansion disorder. FUNDING: Medical Research Council, Department of Health and

TI  - Macular Morpho-Functional and Visual Pathways Functional Assessment in Patients 
      with Spinocerebellar Type 1 Ataxia with or without Neurological Signs.
LID - 10.3390/jcm10225271 [doi]
LID - 5271
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA-ATXN1) is an autosomal dominant, 
      neurodegenerative disease, caused by CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin-1 gene 
      (ATXN1). In isolated reports of patients with neurological signs [symptomatic 
      patients (SP)], macular abnormalities have been described. However, no reports 
      exist about macular anomalies in SCA1 subjects carrying the ATXN1 mutation 
      without neurological signs [not symptomatic carriers (NSC)]. Therefore, the main 
      aim of our work was to evaluate whether the macular functional and morphological 
      abnormalities could be detectable in SP, genetically confirmed and with 
      neurological signs, as well as in SCA-ATXN1-NSC, harboring pathogenic CAG 
      expansion in ATXN1. In addition, we investigated whether the macular involvement 
      could be associated or not to an impairment of RGCs and of their fibers and of 
      the neural conduction along the visual pathways. Herein, nine SCA-ATXN1 subjects 
      (6 SP and 3 NSC) underwent the following examinations: visual acuity and 
      chromatic test assessments, fundus oculi (FO) examination, macular and 
      peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL-T) analysis by Spectral 
      domain-Optical Coherence Tomography (Sd-OCT) acquisition, multifocal 
      electroretinogram (mfERG), pattern reversal electroretinogram (PERG) and visual 
      evoked potentials (VEP) recordings. In four eyes of two SP, visual acuity 
      reduction and chromatic abnormalities were observed; in three of them FO changes 
      associated with macular thinning and outer retinal defects were also detected. In 
      three NSC eyes, slight FO abnormalities were associated with qualitative macular 
      morphological changes. By contrast, abnormal mfERG responses (exclusively from 
      foveal and parafoveal areas) were detected in all SP and NSC (18 eyes). No 
      abnormalities of PERG values, RNFL-T, and VEP responses were found, but in one 
      SP, presenting abnormal papillo-macular bundle neural conduction. Results from 
      our SCA-ATXN1 cohort suggest that a macular dysfunction, detectable by mfERG 
      recordings, may occur in the overt disorder, and unexpectedly in the stage of the 
      disease in which there is still an absence of neurological signs. In NSC, an 
      exclusive dysfunction of preganglionic macular elements can be observed, and this 
      is associated with both normal RGCs function and neural conduction along the 
      visual pathways.

TI  - Detection Methods and Status of CAT Interruption of ATXN1 in Korean Patients With 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1.
PG  - 274-277
LID - 10.3343/alm.2022.42.2.274 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by 
      abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin 1 gene (ATXN1). The presence of CAT 
      interruption(s) is important for diagnosing SCA1 in patients with 39-44 repeat 
      alleles, as only uninterrupted alleles are considered abnormal. Determining the 
      CAT interruption status might also be important for patients with >44 repeats, as 
      the length of the longest uninterrupted CAG repeat stretch has been correlated 
      with age at SCA1 onset. We detected CAT interruption(s) in the archived samples 
      of Korean SCA1 patients using a traditional restriction enzyme method and 
      validated the usefulness of a fluorescence-based tethering PCR procedure. Among 
      the 2,312 alleles analyzed from 1,156 patients, we found 17 expanded alleles with 
      >/=39 repeats, 71% of which harbored 39-44 repeats. Restriction enzyme method of 
      six samples (four with 39-44 repeats and two with >44 repeats) revealed that none 
      of the expanded alleles had CAT interruption(s). Tethering PCR showed the 
      characteristic electropherogram pattern expected without CAT interruption(s). 
      Along with the enzyme restriction method, tethering PCR can be applied to 
      determine the number of allele repeats and provide information on CAT 
      interruption(s) in clinical laboratories.

LID - 382
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetics of cerebellar ataxia is complex. Hundreds of causative 
      genes have been identified, but only a few cause more than single cases. The 
      spectrum of ataxia-causing genes differs considerably between populations. The 
      aim of the study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of ataxia in the 
      Finnish population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients in hospital database were 
      reviewed for the diagnosis of unspecified ataxia. Acquired ataxias and nongenetic 
      ataxias such as those related to infection, trauma or stroke were excluded. Sixty 
      patients with sporadic ataxia with unknown etiology and 36 patients with familial 
      ataxia of unknown etiology were recruited in the study. Repeat expansions in the 
      SCA genes (ATXN1, 2, 3, 7, 8/OS, CACNA1A, TBP), FXN, and RFC1 were determined. 
      Point mutations in POLG, SPG7 and in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were investigated. 
      In addition, DNA from 8 patients was exome sequenced. RESULTS: A genetic cause of 
      ataxia was found in 33 patients (34.4%). Seven patients had a dominantly 
      inherited repeat expansion in ATXN8/OS. Ten patients had mitochondrial ataxia 
      resulting from mutations in nuclear mitochondrial genes POLG or RARS2, or from a 
      point mutation m.8561C > G or a single deletion in mtDNA. Interestingly, five 
      patients were biallelic for the recently identified pathogenic repeat expansion 
      in RFC1. All the five patients presented with the phenotype of cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia (CANVAS). Moreover, screening of 54 patients 
      with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy revealed four additional patients with 
      biallelic repeat expansion in RFC1, but none of them had cerebellar symptoms. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Expansion in ATXN8/OS results in the majority of dominant ataxias in 
      Finland, while mutations in RFC1 and POLG are the most common cause of recessive 
      ataxias. Our results suggest that analysis of RFC1 should be included in the 
      routine diagnostics of idiopathic ataxia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth polyneuropathy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening for short tandem repeat (STR) expansions in next-generation 
      sequencing data can enable diagnosis, optimal clinical management/treatment, and 
      accurate genetic counseling of patients with repeat expansion disorders. We aimed 
      to develop an efficient computational workflow for reliable detection of STR 
      expansions in next-generation sequencing data and demonstrate its clinical 
      utility. METHODS: We characterized the performance of eight STR analysis methods 
      (lobSTR, HipSTR, RepeatSeq, ExpansionHunter, TREDPARSE, GangSTR, STRetch, and 
      exSTRa) on next-generation sequencing datasets of samples with known 
      disease-causing full-mutation STR expansions and genomes simulated to harbor 
      repeat expansions at selected loci and optimized their sensitivity. We then used 
      a machine learning decision tree classifier to identify an optimal combination of 
      methods for full-mutation detection. In Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)-aligned 
      genomes, the ensemble approach of using ExpansionHunter, STRetch, and exSTRa 
      performed the best (precision = 82%, recall = 100%, F1-score = 90%). We applied 
      this pipeline to screen 301 families of children with suspected genetic 
      disorders. RESULTS: We identified 10 individuals with full-mutations in the AR, 
      ATXN1, ATXN8, DMPK, FXN, or HTT disease STR locus in the analyzed families. 
      Additional candidates identified in our analysis include two probands with 
      borderline ATXN2 expansions between the established repeat size range for 
      reduced-penetrance and full-penetrance full-mutation and seven individuals with 
      FMR1 CGG repeats in the intermediate/premutation repeat size range. In 67 
      probands with a prior negative clinical PCR test for the FMR1, FXN, or DMPK 
      disease STR locus, or the spinocerebellar ataxia disease STR panel, our pipeline 
      did not falsely identify aberrant expansion. We performed clinical PCR tests on 
      seven (out of 10) full-mutation samples identified by our pipeline and confirmed 
      the expansion status in all, showing absolute concordance between our 
      bioinformatics and molecular findings. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully 
      demonstrated the application of a well-optimized bioinformatics pipeline that 
      promotes the utility of genome-wide sequencing as a first-tier screening test to 
      detect expansions of known disease STRs. Interrogating clinical next-generation 
      sequencing data for pathogenic STR expansions using our ensemble pipeline can 
      improve diagnostic yield and enhance clinical outcomes for patients with repeat 
      expansion disorders.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized primarily by progressive loss of motor neurons. Although ALS occurs 
      worldwide and the frequency and spectrum of identifiable genetic causes of 
      disease varies across populations, very few studies have included African 
      subjects. In addition to a hexanucleotide repeat expansion (RE) in C9orf72, the 
      most common genetic cause of ALS in Europeans, REs in ATXN2, NIPA1 and ATXN1 have 
      shown variable associations with ALS in Europeans. Intermediate range expansions 
      in some of these genes (e.g. ATXN2) have been reported as potential risk factors, 
      or phenotypic modifiers, of ALS. Pathogenic expansions in NOP56 cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-36, which can present with prominent motor neuron 
      degeneration. Here we compare REs in these genes in a cohort of Africans with ALS 
      and population controls using whole genome sequencing data. Targeting genotyping 
      of short tandem repeats at known loci within ATXN2, NIPA1, ATXN1 and NOP56 was 
      performed using ExpansionHunter software in 105 Southern African (SA) patients 
      with ALS. African population controls were from an in-house SA population control 
      database (n = 25), the SA Human Genome Program (n = 24), the Simons Genome 
      Diversity Project (n = 39) and the Illumina Polaris Diversity Cohort (IPDC) 
      dataset (n = 50). We found intermediate RE alleles in ATXN2 (27-33 repeats) and 
      ATXN1 (33-35 repeats), and NIPA1 long alleles (>/=8 repeats) were rare in Africans, 
      and not associated with ALS (p > 0.17). NOP56 showed no expanded alleles in 
      either ALS or controls. We also compared the differences in allele distributions 
      between the African and n = 50 European controls (from the IPDC). There was a 
      statistical significant difference in the distribution of the REs in the ATXN1 
      between African and European controls (Chi-test p < 0.001), and NIPA1 showed 
      proportionately more longer alleles (RE > 8) in Europeans vs. Africans (Fisher's 
      p = 0.016). The distribution of RE alleles in ATXN2 and NOP56 were similar 
      amongst African and European controls. In conclusion, repeat expansions in ATXN2, 
      NIPA1 and ATXN1, which showed associations with ALS in Europeans, were not 
      replicated in Southern Africans with ALS.

PG  - 117-125

AB  - PURPOSE: Investigate single nucleotide variants and short tandem repeats in 39 
      genes related to spinocerebellar ataxia in clinical and pathologically defined 
      cohorts of multiple system atrophy. METHODS: Exome sequencing was conducted in 28 
      clinical multiple system atrophy patients to identify single nucleotide variants 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes. Novel variants were validated in two 
      independent disease cohorts: 86 clinically diagnosed multiple system atrophy 
      patients and 166 pathological multiple system atrophy cases. Expanded repeat 
      alleles in spinocerebellar ataxia genes were evaluated in 36 clinically diagnosed 
      multiple system atrophy patients, and CAG/CAA repeats in TATA-Box Binding Protein 
      (TBP, causative of SCA17) were screened in 216 clinical and pathological multiple 
      system atrophy patients and 346 controls. RESULTS: No known pathogenic 
      spinocerebellar ataxia single nucleotide variants or pathogenic range expanded 
      repeat alleles of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, AXTN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, 
      and TBP were detected in any clinical multiple system atrophy patients. However, 
      four novel variants were identified in four spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes 
      across three multiple system atrophy patients. Additionally, four multiple system 
      atrophy patients (1.6%) and one control (0.3%) carried an intermediate length 41 
      TBP CAG/CAA repeat allele (OR = 4.11, P = 0.21). There was a significant 
      association between the occurrence of a repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) and an increased risk of multiple system atrophy (OR = 1.64, P = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: Occurrence of TBP CAG/CAA repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) is significantly associated with increased multiple system atrophy risk. 
      This discovery warrants further investigation and supports a possible genetic 
      overlap of multiple system atrophy with SCA17.

TI  - Genomic Portrait of a Sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Case in a Large 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 Family.
LID - 10.3390/jpm10040262 [doi]
LID - 262
AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansions in the spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) gene 
      ATXN1 increases the risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), supporting a 
      relationship between these disorders. We recently reported the co-existence, in a 
      large SCA1 family, of a clinically definite ALS individual bearing an 
      intermediate ATXN1 expansion and SCA1 patients with a full expansion, some of 
      which manifested signs of lower motor neuron involvement. METHODS: In this study, 
      we employed a systems biology approach that integrated multiple genomic analyses 
      of the ALS patient and some SCA1 family members. RESULTS: Our analysis identified 
      common and distinctive candidate genes/variants and related biological processes 
      that, in addition to or in combination with ATXN1, may contribute to motor neuron 
      degeneration phenotype. Among these, we distinguished ALS-specific likely 
      pathogenic variants in TAF15 and C9ORF72, two ALS-linked genes involved in the 
      regulation of RNA metabolism, similarly to ATXN1, suggesting a selective role for 
      this pathway in ALS pathogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our work supports the 
      utility to apply personal genomic information for characterizing complex disease 
      phenotypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3 and Huntington disease are 
      neurodegenerative disorders caused by expanded CAG repeats. METHODS: We performed 
      an in-silico analysis of CAG repeats in ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, and HTT using 30x 
      whole-=genome sequencing data of 2504 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. 
      RESULTS: Seven HTT-positive, 3 ATXN2-positive, 1 ATXN3-positive, and 6 possibly 
      ATXN1-positive samples were identified. No correlation was found between the 
      repeat sizes of the different genes. The distribution of CAG alleles varied by 
      ethnicity. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that there may be asymptomatic small 
      expanded repeats in almost 0.5% of these populations. (c) 2020 International

TI  - ATXN1 repeat expansions confer risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 
      contribute to TDP-43 mislocalization.
PG  - fcaa064

AB  - Increasingly, repeat expansions are being identified as part of the complex 
      genetic architecture of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To date, several repeat 
      expansions have been genetically associated with the disease: intronic repeat 
      expansions in C9orf72, polyglutamine expansions in ATXN2 and polyalanine 
      expansions in NIPA1. Together with previously published data, the identification 
      of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patient with a family history of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, caused by polyglutamine expansions in ATXN1, 
      suggested a similar disease association for the repeat expansion in ATXN1. We, 
      therefore, performed a large-scale international study in 11 700 individuals, in 
      which we showed a significant association between intermediate ATXN1 repeat 
      expansions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (P = 3.33 x 10(-7)). Subsequent 
      functional experiments have shown that ATXN1 reduces the nucleocytoplasmic ratio 
      of TDP-43 and enhances amyotrophic lateral sclerosis phenotypes in Drosophila, 
      further emphasizing the role of polyglutamine repeat expansions in the 
      pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

TI  - Patterns of CAG repeat instability in the central nervous system and periphery in 
      Huntington's disease and in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.
PG  - 2551-2567
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddaa139 [doi]
AB  - The expanded HTT CAG repeat causing Huntington's disease (HD) exhibits somatic 
      expansion proposed to drive the rate of disease onset by eliciting a pathological 
      process that ultimately claims vulnerable cells. To gain insight into somatic 
      expansion in humans, we performed comprehensive quantitative analyses of CAG 
      expansion in ~50 central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral postmortem tissues 
      from seven adult-onset and one juvenile-onset HD individual. We also assessed 
      ATXN1 CAG repeat expansion in brain regions of an individual with a 
      neurologically and pathologically distinct repeat expansion disorder, 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). Our findings reveal similar profiles of 
      tissue instability in all HD individuals, which, notably, were also apparent in 
      the SCA1 individual. CAG expansion was observed in all tissues, but to different 
      degrees, with multiple cortical regions and neostriatum tending to have the 
      greatest instability in the CNS, and liver in the periphery. These patterns 
      indicate different propensities for CAG expansion contributed by disease 
      locus-independent trans-factors and demonstrate that expansion per se is not 
      sufficient to cause cell type or disease-specific pathology. Rather, pathology 
      may reflect distinct toxic processes triggered by different repeat lengths across 
      cell types and diseases. We also find that the HTT CAG length-dependent expansion 
      propensity of an individual is reflected in all tissues and in cerebrospinal 
      fluid. Our data indicate that peripheral cells may be a useful source to measure 
      CAG expansion in biomarker assays for therapeutic efforts, prompting efforts to 
      dissect underlying mechanisms of expansion that may differ between the brain and 
      periphery.

AB  - SAFB1 is a DNA and RNA binding protein that is highly expressed in the cerebellum 
      and hippocampus and is involved in the processing of coding and non-coding RNAs, 
      splicing and dendritic function. We analyzed SAFB1 expression in the post-mortem 
      brain tissue of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), Huntington's disease (HD), Multiple 
      sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease patients and controls. In SCA cases, the 
      expression of SAFB1 in the nucleus was increased and there was abnormal and 
      extensive expression in the cytoplasm where it co-localized with the markers of 
      Purkinje cell injury. Significantly, no SAFB1 expression was found in the 
      cerebellar neurons of the dentate nucleus in control or MS patients; however, in 
      SCA patients, SAFB1 expression was increased significantly in both the nucleus 
      and cytoplasm of dentate neurons. In HD, we found that SAFB1 expression was 
      increased in the nucleus and cytoplasm of striatal neurons; however, there was no 
      SAFB1 staining in the striatal neurons of controls. In PD substantia nigra, we 
      did not see any changes in neuronal SAFB1 expression. iCLIP analysis found that 
      SAFB1 crosslink sites within ATXN1 RNA were adjacent to the start and within the 
      glutamine repeat sequence. Further investigation found increased binding of SAFB1 
      to pathogenic ATXN1-85Q mRNA. These novel data strongly suggest SAFB1 contributes 
      to the etiology of SCA and Huntington's chorea and that it may be a pathological 
      marker of polyglutamine repeat expansion diseases.

AB  - Little is known about the genetic basis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 
      outside Europe and US. In this study, we investigated whether intermediate CAG 
      expansions at ATXN1 were associated to ALS in the Brazilian population. To 
      accomplish that, representative samples from 411 unrelated patients and 436 
      neurologically normal controls from 6 centers spread over the territory were 
      genotyped to quantify ATXN1 expansions. We found that ATXN1 intermediate-length 
      expansion (>/=34 CAG repeats) are associated with the disease (odds ratio...=...2.19, 
      95% CI...=...1.081-4.441, p...=....026). Most ATXN1-positive patients had classical 
      phenotype, but some of them presented predominant lower motor neuron involvement. 
      None of them had associated ataxia. Frontotemporal dementia was concomitantly 
      found in 12.5% of patients carrying the intermediate ATXN1 expansion. Further 
      studies are needed to validate these findings and to understand the 
      pathophysiological mechanisms that connect ataxin-1 and ALS.

TI  - Frequency and distribution of polyQ disease intermediate-length repeat alleles in 
      healthy Italian population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1-2-17 
      (SCA1-2-17) are adult-onset autosomal dominant diseases, caused by triplet repeat 
      expansions in the HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, and TBP genes. Alleles with a repeat number 
      just below the pathological threshold are associated with reduced penetrance and 
      meiotic instability and are defined as intermediate alleles (IAs). OBJECTIVES: We 
      aimed to determine the frequencies of IAs in healthy Italian subjects and to 
      compare the proportion of the IAs with the prevalence of the respective diseases. 
      METHODS: We analyzed the triplet repeat size in HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, and TBP genes 
      in the DNA samples from 729 consecutive adult healthy Italian subjects. RESULTS: 
      IAs associated with reduced penetrance were found in ATXN2 gene (1 subject, 0.1%) 
      and TBP gene (0.82%). IAs at risk for meiotic instability were found in HTT 
      (5.3%) and ATXN2 genes (2.7%). In ATXN1, we found a low percentage of IAs (0.4%). 
      Alleles lacking the common CAT interruption within the CAG sequence were also 
      rare (0.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The high frequencies of IAs in HTT and ATXN2 genes 
      suggest a correlation with the prevalence of the diseases in our population and 
      support the hypothesis that IAs could represent a reservoir of new pathological 
      expansions. On the opposite, ATXN1-IA were very rare in respect to the prevalence 
      of SCA1 in our country, and TBP- IA were more frequent than expected, suggesting 
      that other mechanisms could influence the occurrence of novel pathological 
      expansions.

AB  - We analyzed the frequency of intermediate alleles (IAs) in the ATXN1, ATXN2, and 
      HTT genes in several neurodegenerative diseases. The study included 1126 patients 
      with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 440 patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 
      and 610 patients with Parkinson's disease. In all cohorts, we genotyped ATXN1 and 
      ATXN2 CAG repeats. In addition, in the FTD cohort, we determined the number of 
      HTT CAG repeats. The frequency of HTT IAs was higher in patients with FTD (6.9%) 
      versus controls (2.9%) and in the C9orf72 expansion noncarriers (7.2%) versus 
      controls (2.9%), although the difference was nonsignificant after correction for 
      multiple testing. Compared with controls, progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) 
      groups showed a significantly higher frequency of HTT IAs (13.6% vs. 2.9% 
      controls). For the ATXN2 gene, we observed an increase in IA frequency in AD 
      cases (AD 4.1% vs. controls 1.8%) and in the behavioral FTD group (4.8% vs. 
      1.8%). For the ATXN1 gene, we found a significant increase of IAs in patients 
      with PNFA (18.6%) versus controls (6.7%). In conclusion, our work suggests that 
      the HTT and ATXN1 IAS may contribute to PNFA pathogenesis and point to a link 
      between ATXN2 IAS and AD.

PG  - 185-194
LID - 10.1080/15257770.2019.1671592 [doi]
AB  - Trinucleotide repeats are responsible for many genetic diseases. Previous studies 
      have shown that duplex RNAs (dsRNAs) can be used to target expression of a mutant 
      repeat allele while leaving expression of the wild-type allele untouched, 
      creating opportunities for allele-selective inhibition and better therapeutic 
      outcomes. In contrast to successes with other genes, we report here that we 
      cannot achieve allele-selective inhibition when targeting the expanded CAG repeat 
      within Ataxin-1 (ATXN1), the cause of spinal cerebellar ataxia-1 (SCA1). The most 
      likely explanation for this unfavorable outcome is that the mean CAG repeat 
      number within wild-type ATXN1 is relatively high compared to other trinucleotide 
      repeat diseases. Because the wild-type repeat number is high, it is likely that 
      there is poor discrimination between the mutant and wild-type repeat and less 
      opportunity for allele-selective inhibition across the entire spectrum of 
      mutations found in SCA1 patients. Our data support the conclusion that the 
      potential for multiple cooperative binding interactions is a critical factor 
      governing allele-selective recognition of trinucleotide repeat genes by duplex 
      RNAs. These results should be helpful in predicting which diseases and which 
      patients are most likely to benefit from allele-selective targeting of expanded 
      repeats.

TI  - (CAG)(n) loci as genetic modifiers of age at onset in patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 from mainland China.
PG  - 1130-1136
LID - 10.1111/ene.13954 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The expanded repeat length in ATXN1 negatively correlates 
      with age at onset (AAO) of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) but can explain 
      only part of it, indicating that other factors affect AAO. Some studies have 
      explored the influence of non-causative CAG repeats on the AAO of SCA patients. 
      However, studies on Chinese SCA1 patients regarding candidate modifier factors 
      involved in the variability in AAO are rare. METHODS: In all, 152 Chinese SCA1 
      patients who were genotyped for ATXN1 and nine other (CAG)(n) -containing genes 
      were enrolled. Regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of the 
      expanded allele of ATXN1 (linear and quadratic effects) on AAO. Then, different 
      models were used to explore the modulatory effect of nine other (CAG)(n) 
      -containing genes. RESULTS: Our results verified the negative effect of the 
      expanded allele in ATXN1 by regression analysis. Some (CAG)(n) -containing genes 
      including TBP, ATN1 and HTT modified AAO with variance ranging from 0.8% to 3.8% 
      and tended to decrease or delay AAO. However, no modifier effects of ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, KCNN3, RAI1 and normal ATXN1 alleles in trans were 
      detected. CONCLUSION: By using interaction analyses, TBP, ATN1 and HTT were 
      determined to have modifying effects. Our study revealed that differences in 
      modulation may be due to ethnic and geographic diversity across different 
      populations. Furthermore, the variability of AAO was not completely explained by 
      the genetic modifiers examined here, suggesting that other genetic or 
      environmental factors are involved in these diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) caused by pathogenic CAG repeat 
      expansion in the ATXN1 is characterized by loss of vision with little fundus 
      abnormalities in some patients. Recently, macular degeneration has been reported 
      to account for the visual symptoms in sporadic cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five 
      consecutive patients diagnosed as SCA1 with supporting genetical evidence were 
      newly referred to ophthalmology department from neurology unit. They underwent 
      ocular examination to assess visual acuity and the structural integrity of the 
      macula using optical coherent tomography (OCT). Full-field and multifocal 
      electroretinogram (ERG) were recorded in some patients. Genetic testing was done 
      by a polymerase chain reaction-based method. RESULTS: Fundus examinations 
      revealed normal optic disc and macula appearance. However, four out of five 
      patients had foveal thinning by OCT. This included three patients who showed 
      reduced visual acuity. Among the three, multifocal ERG was performed in two, 
      which showed reduced amplitudes in the localized foveal area. Full-field ERG 
      showed normal responses in all five patients assessed. Only one patient had 
      normal visual function and normal macular structure. CONCLUSIONS: Macular 
      degeneration with subtle funduscopic alterations, sometimes mimicking occult 
      macular dystrophy, is an important cause of visual loss in SCA1 patients, which 
      could be reliably detected with OCT and multifocal ERGs.

TI  - Large normal alleles of ATXN2 decrease age at onset in transthyretin familial 
      amyloid polyneuropathy Val30Met patients.
PG  - 251-258
LID - 10.1002/ana.25409 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Transthyretin (TTR)-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is 
      an autosomal dominant neurological disease, caused most frequently by a Val30Met 
      (now classified as Val50Met) substitution in TTR. Age at onset (AO) ranges from 
      19 to 82 years, and variability exists mostly between generations. Unstable 
      oligonucleotide repeats in various genes are the mechanism behind several 
      neurological diseases, found also to act as modifiers for other disorders. Our 
      aim was to investigate whether large normal repeat alleles of 10 genes had a 
      possible modifier effect in AO in Portuguese TTR-FAP Val30Met families. METHODS: 
      We analyzed 329 Portuguese patients from 123 families. Repeat length (at ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, TBP, ATN1, HTT, JPH3, AR, and DMPK) was assessed by single 
      and multiplex polymerase chain reaction, using fluorescently labeled primers, 
      followed by capillary electrophoresis. We used a family-centered approach, and 
      generalized estimating equations were used to account for AO correlation between 
      family members. RESULTS: For ATXN2, the presence of at least 1 allele longer than 
      22 CAGs was significantly associated with an earlier onset in TTR-FAP Val30Met, 
      decreasing mean AO by 6 years (95% confidence interval = -8.81 to -2.19, p = 
      0.001). No association was found for the remaining repeat loci. INTERPRETATION: 
      Length of normal repeats at ATXN2 may modify AO in TTR-FAP Val30Met and may 
      function as a risk factor. This can be due to the role of ATXN2 in RNA metabolism 
      and as a modulator of various cellular processes, including mitochondrial stress. 
      This may have relevant implications for prognosis and the follow-up of 
      presymptomatic carriers. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:251-258.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in ATXN1, characterized by progressive cerebellar and 
      extracerebellar symptoms. MRI-based studies in SCA1 focused in the cerebellum and 
      connections, but there are few data about supratentorial/spinal damage and its 
      clinical relevance. We have thus designed this multimodal MRI study to uncover 
      the structural signature of SCA1. To accomplish that, a group of 33 patients and 
      33 age-and gender-matched healthy controls underwent MRI on a 3T scanner. All 
      patients underwent a comprehensive neurological and neuropsychological 
      evaluation. We correlated the structural findings with the clinical features of 
      the disease. In addition, we evaluated the disease progression looking at 
      differences in SCA1 subgroups defined by disease duration. Ataxia and pyramidal 
      signs were the main symptoms. Neuropsychological evaluation disclosed cognitive 
      impairment in 53% with predominant frontotemporal dysfunction. Gray matter 
      analysis unfolded cortical thinning of primary and associative motor areas with 
      more restricted impairment of deep structures. Deep gray matter atrophy was 
      associated with motor handicap and poor cognition skills. White matter integrity 
      loss was diffuse in the brainstem but restricted in supratentorial structures. 
      Cerebellar cortical thinning was found in multiple areas and correlated not only 
      with motor disability but also with verbal fluency. Spinal cord atrophy 
      correlated with motor handicap. Comparison of MRI findings in disease 
      duration-defined subgroups identified a peculiar pattern of progressive 
      degeneration.

AB  - Genomewide association studies (GWASs) have contributed greatly to unraveling the 
      genetic basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a large amount of "missing 
      heritability" remains. In this exploratory study, we investigated the effect of 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in polyglutamine disease-associated genes 
      (PDAGs) on the risk of AD and its expression. In a cohort of 959 patients 
      diagnosed with AD (Amsterdam Dementia cohort) and 4106 cognitively healthy 
      participants (Leiden 85-plus Study and the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in 
      the Elderly at Risk), we determined the CAG repeat sequences in ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, HTT, ATN1, and AR. We did not find a significant 
      association between the risk of AD and variations in CAG repeat numbers of PDAGs. 
      However, we found that differences in CAG repeat numbers in ATXN1, ATXN2, and AR 
      were significantly associated with several clinical and imaging features in AD 
      patients. Specifically, the association between memory performance in patients 
      with AD and the CAG repeat size in the longer ATXN1 allele, and the association 
      between atrophy in the medial temporal lobes and the CAG repeat number in the 
      longer AR allele remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Our 
      findings suggest that repeat polymorphisms in ATXN1 and AR can act as important 
      genetic modifiers of AD, warranting further scrutiny of their role in its missing 
      heritability and pathogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The worldwide prevalence of obesity, a major risk factor for numerous 
      debilitating chronic disorders, is increasing rapidly. Although a substantial 
      amount of the variation in body mass index (BMI) is estimated to be heritable, 
      the largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to date 
      explained only ~2.7% of the variation. To tackle this 'missing heritability' 
      problem of obesity, here we focused on the contribution of DNA repeat length 
      polymorphisms which are not detectable by GWAS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We 
      determined the cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat length in the nine known 
      polyglutamine disease-associated genes (ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, 
      HTT, ATN1 and AR) in two large cohorts consisting of 12,457 individuals and 
      analyzed their association with BMI, using generalized linear mixed-effect 
      models. RESULTS: We found a significant association between BMI and the length of 
      CAG repeats in seven polyglutamine disease-associated genes (including ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP and AR). Importantly, these repeat variations 
      could account for 0.75% of the total BMI variation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      incriminate repeat polymorphisms as an important novel class of genetic risk 
      factors of obesity and highlight the role of the brain in its pathophysiology.

      Interruption.

LID - 200
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by an expansion of a polyglutamine tract within the ATXN1 gene. 
      Normal alleles have been reported to range from 6 to 35 repeats, intermediate 
      alleles from 36 to 38 repeats and fully penetrant pathogenic alleles have at 
      least 39 repeats. This distribution was based on relatively few samples and the 
      narrow intermediate range makes the accuracy of the repeat sizing crucial for 
      interpreting and reporting diagnostic tests, which can vary between laboratories. 
      Here, we examine the distribution of 6378 SCA1 chromosomes and identify a very 
      late onset SCA1 family with a fully penetrant uninterrupted pathogenic allele 
      containing 38 repeats. This finding supports the theory that polyQ toxicity is 
      related to the increase of the length of the inherited tracts and not as 
      previously hypothesized to the structural transition occurring above a specific 
      threshold. In addition, the threshold of toxicity shifts to a shorter polyQ 
      length with the increase of the lifespan in SCA1. Furthermore, we show that SCA1 
      intermediate alleles have a different behavior compared to the other 
      polyglutamine disorders as they do not show reduced penetrance when 
      uninterrupted. Therefore, the pathogenic mechanism in SCA1 is distinct from other 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat disorders. Accurately sizing repeats is 
      paramount in precision medicine and can be challenging particularly with 
      borderline alleles. We examined plasmids containing cloned CAG repeat tracts 
      alongside a triplet repeat primed polymerase chain reaction (TP PCR) CAG repeat 
      ladder to improve accuracy in repeat sizing by fragment analysis. This method 
      accurately sizes the repeats irrespective of repeat composition or length. We 
      also improved the model for calculating repeat length from fragment analysis 
      sizing by fragment analyzing 100 cloned repeats of known size. Therefore, we 
      recommend these methods for accurately sizing repeat lengths and restriction 
      enzyme digestion to identify interruptions for interpretation of a given allele's 
      pathogenicity.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a group of genetic diseases of the nervous system 
      with genetic and clinical heterogeneity. SCA is often caused by an expanded CAG 
      repeat sequence in the encoding protein. Genetic testing is necessary to diagnose 
      and classify the types of SCA. Next...generation DNA sequencing usually generates a 
      high error rate for insertion or deletion mutations, so it is unhelpful for 
      classifying the types of SCA. In the present study, a Chinese SCA pedigree was 
      preliminarily diagnosed with SCA1 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      amplification. The propositus and his three younger siblings were diagnosed with 
      SCA1 as a result of the identification of the length of the expanded CAG repeat 
      sequence in the ATXN1 gene performed using Sanger sequencing. The current study 
      presents a convenient and efficient method to identify causative mutations for 
      polyglutamine SCA using PCR amplification followed by Sanger sequencing.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in exon 8 of the ATXN1 gene. We generated 
      induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from a SCA1 patient and his non-affected 
      sister by using non-integrating Sendai Viruses (SeV). The resulting hiPSCs are 
      SeVfree, express pluripotency markers, display a normal karyotype, retain the 
      mutation (length of the CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN1 gene) and are able to 
      differentiate into the three germ layers in vitro.

AB  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a complex and multifactorial neurodegenerative 
      disease, and its pathogenesis remains uncertain. Patients with MSA or 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) show overlapping clinical phenotypes. Previous 
      studies have reported that intermediate or long CAG expansions in SCA genes have 
      been associated with other neurodegenerative disease. In this study, we screened 
      for the number of CAG repeats in ATXN1, 2 and 3 in 200 patients with MSA and 314 
      healthy controls to evaluate possible associations between (CAG)(n) in these 
      three polyQ-related genes and MSA. Our findings indicated that longer repeat 
      lengths in ATXN2 were associated with increased risk for MSA in Chinese 
      individuals. No relationship was observed between CAG repeat length in the three 
      examined genes and age at onset (AO) of MSA.

AB  - To clarify the possible involvement of intermediate ATXN1 alleles as risk factors 
      for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we tested ATXN1 in a cohort of 1146 
      Italian ALS patients, previously screened for variants in other ALS genes, and in 
      529 controls. We detected ATXN1 alleles with >/=33 polyglutamine repeats in 105 of 
      1146 patients (9.16%) and 29 of 529 controls (5.48%) (p = 0.003). The frequency 
      of ATXN1 alleles with >/=33 polyglutamine repeats was particularly high in the 
      group of ALS patients carrying the C9orf72 expansion (12/59, 20.3%). We confirmed 
      this result in an independent cohort of C9orf72 Italian patients (10/80 cases, 
      12.5%), thus finding a cumulative frequency of ATXN1 expansion of 15.82% in 
      C9orf72 carriers (p = 2.40E-05). Our results strongly support the hypothesis that 
      ATXN1 could act as a disease risk gene in ALS, mostly in C9orf72 expansion 
      carriers. Further studies are needed to confirm our results and to define the 
      mechanism by which ATXN1 might contribute to neuronal degeneration leading to 
      ALS.

AB  - Cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansions in the coding regions of nine 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) genes (HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATN1, AR, 
      and TBP) are the cause of several neurodegenerative diseases including 
      Huntington's disease (HD), six different spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. The 
      expanded CAG repeat length in the causative gene is negatively related to the 
      age-at-onset (AAO) of clinical symptoms. In addition to the expanded CAG repeat 
      length in the causative gene, the normal CAG repeats in the other polyQ genes can 
      affect the AAO, suggesting functional interactions between the polyQ genes. 
      However, there is no detailed assessment of the relationships among polyQ genes 
      in pathologically relevant brain regions. We used gene co-expression analysis to 
      study the functional relationships among polyQ genes in different brain regions 
      using the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), a spatial map of gene expression in the 
      healthy brain. We constructed co-expression networks for seven anatomical brain 
      structures, as well as a region showing a specific pattern of atrophy in HD 
      patients detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. In this 
      HD-associated region, we found that ATN1 and ATXN2 were co-expressed and shared 
      co-expression partners which were enriched for DNA repair genes. We observed a 
      similar co-expression pattern in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and striatum in 
      which this relation was most pronounced. Given that the co-expression patterns 
      for these anatomical structures were similar to those for the HD-associated 
      region, our results suggest that their disruption is likely involved in HD 
      pathology. Moreover, ATN1 and ATXN2 also shared many co-expressed genes with HTT, 
      the causative gene of HD, across the brain. Although this triangular relationship 
      among these three polyQ genes may also be dysregulated in other polyQ diseases, 
      stronger co-expression patterns between ATN1 and ATXN2 observed in the 
      HD-associated region, especially in the striatum, may be more specific to HD.

TI  - Postural Tremor and Ataxia Progression in Spinocerebellar Ataxias.
PG  - 492
LID - 10.7916/D8GM8KRH [doi]
LID - 492
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postural tremor can sometimes occur in spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs). However, the prevalence and clinical characteristics of postural tremor 
      in SCAs are poorly understood, and whether SCA patients with postural tremor have 
      different ataxia progression is not known. METHODS: We studied postural tremor in 
      315 patients with SCA1, 2, 3, and 6 recruited from the Clinical Research 
      Consortium for Spinocerebellar Ataxias (CRC-SCA), which consists of 12 
      participating centers in the United States, and we evaluated ataxia progression 
      in these patients from January 2010 to August 2012. RESULTS: Among 315 SCA 
      patients, postural tremor was most common in SCA2 patients (SCA1, 5.8%; SCA2, 
      27.5%; SCA3, 12.4%; SCA6, 16.9%; p = 0.007). SCA3 patients with postural tremor 
      had longer CAG repeat expansions than SCA3 patients without postural tremor 
      (73.67 +/- 3.12 vs. 70.42 +/- 3.96, p = 0.003). Interestingly, SCA1 and SCA6 patients 
      with postural tremor had a slower rate of ataxia progression (SCA1, beta = -0.91, p 
      < 0.001; SCA6, beta = -1.28, p = 0.025), while SCA2 patients with postural tremor 
      had a faster rate of ataxia progression (beta = 1.54, p = 0.034). We also found that 
      the presence of postural tremor in SCA2 patients could be influenced by repeat 
      expansions of ATXN1 (beta = -1.53, p = 0.037) and ATXN3 (beta = 0.57, p = 0.018), 
      whereas postural tremor in SCA3 was associated with repeat lengths in TBP (beta = 
      0.63, p = 0.041) and PPP2R2B (beta = -0.40, p = 0.032). DISCUSSION: Postural tremor 
      could be a clinical feature of SCAs, and the presence of postural tremor could be 
      associated with different rates of ataxia progression. Genetic interactions 
      between ataxia genes might influence the brain circuitry and thus affect the 
      clinical presentation of postural tremor.

      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in the huntingtin gene (HTT) are 
      associated with an increased risk of lifetime depression. However, to what extent 
      the variations in CAG repeat length in the other eight polyglutamine 
      disease-associated genes (PDAGs) are associated with depression is still unknown. 
      We determined the CAG repeat sizes of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, 
      ATN1 and AR in two well-characterized Dutch cohorts-the Netherlands Study of 
      Depression and Anxiety and the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older 
      Persons-including 2165 depressed and 1058 non-depressed individuals-aged 18-93 
      years. The association between PDAG CAG repeat size and the risk for depression 
      was assessed via binary logistic regression. We found that the odds ratio (OR) 
      for lifetime depression was significantly higher for individuals with >10, 
      compared with subjects with </=10, CAG repeats in both ATXN7 alleles (OR=1.90, 
      confidence interval (CI) 1.26-2.85). For TBP we found a similar association: A 
      CAG repeat length exceeding the median in both alleles was associated with an 
      increased risk for lifetime depression (OR=1.33, CI 1.00-1.76). In conclusion, we 
      observed that carriers of either ATXN7 or TBP alleles with relatively large CAG 
      repeat sizes in both alleles had a substantially increased risk of lifetime 
      depression. Our findings provide critical evidence for the notion that repeat 
      polymorphisms can act as complex genetic modifiers of depression.

TI  - A panel study on patients with dominant cerebellar ataxia highlights the 
      frequency of channelopathies.

AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias have a marked heterogeneous genetic 
      background, with mutations in 34 genes identified so far. This large amount of 
      implicated genes accounts for heterogeneous clinical presentations, making 
      genotype-phenotype correlations a major challenge in the field. While 
      polyglutamine ataxias, linked to CAG repeat expansions in genes such as ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, CACNA1A and TBP, have been extensively characterized in 
      large cohorts, there is a need for comprehensive assessment of frequency and 
      phenotype of more 'conventional' ataxias. After exclusion of CAG/polyglutamine 
      expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia genes in 412 index cases with dominantly 
      inherited cerebellar ataxias, we aimed to establish the relative frequencies of 
      mutations in other genes, with an approach combining panel sequencing and TaqMan(R) 
      polymerase chain reaction assay. We found relevant genetic variants in 59 
      patients (14.3%). The most frequently mutated were channel genes [CACNA1A (n = 
      16), KCND3 (n = 4), KCNC3 (n = 2) and KCNA1 (n = 2)]. Deletions in ITPR1 (n = 11) 
      were followed by biallelic variants in SPG7 (n = 9). Variants in AFG3L2 (n = 7) 
      came next in frequency, and variants were rarely found in STBN2 (n = 2), ELOVL5, 
      FGF14, STUB1 and TTBK2 (n = 1 each). Interestingly, possible risk factor variants 
      were detected in SPG7 and POLG. Clinical comparisons showed that ataxias due to 
      channelopathies had a significantly earlier age at onset with an average of 24.6 
      years, versus 40.9 years for polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias and 
      37.8 years for SPG7-related forms (P = 0.001). In contrast, disease duration was 
      significantly longer in the former (20.5 years versus 9.3 and 13.7, P=0.001), 
      though for similar functional stages, indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. Of interest, intellectual deficiency was more frequent in channel 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, while cognitive impairment in adulthood was similar 
      among the three groups. Similar differences were found among a single gene group, 
      comparing 23 patients with CACNA1A expansions (spinocerebellar ataxia 6) to 22 
      patients with CACNA1A point mutations, which had lower average age at onset (25.2 
      versus 47.3 years) with longer disease duration (18.7 versus 10.9), but lower 
      severity indexes (0.39 versus 0.44), indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. In conclusion, we identified relevant genetic variations in up to 15% of 
      cases after exclusion of polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias, and 
      confirmed CACNA1A and SPG7 as major ataxia genes. We could delineate firm 
      genotype-phenotype correlations that are important for genetic counselling and of 
      possible prognostic value.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association of repeat expansion size in 10 common 
      degenerative hereditary ataxia genes with essential tremor. These genes were 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 
      (CACNA1A), SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), 
      SCA-17 (TBP) and dentatorubral-pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA) (ATN1). METHODS: 
      Genetic analysis of repeat size in 10 degenerative hereditary ataxia loci was 
      performed in 323 essential tremor patients and 299 controls enrolled at Columbia 
      University. To test for differences in the allele distribution between patients 
      and controls, a CLUMP analysis was performed. RESULTS: None of the essential 
      tremor patients had a repeat expansion in the intermediate or pathogenic range. 
      Significant differences in the distribution of repeats in the 'normal' range for 
      SCA2 and SCA8 (both p </= 0.02) were observed between essential tremor patients and 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      SCA loci are not associated with essential tremor.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an incurable, dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative disease of the cerebellum caused by a polyglutamine-repeat 
      expansion in the protein ataxin-1 (ATXN1). While analysis of human autopsy 
      material indicates significant glial pathology in SCA1, previous research has 
      focused on characterizing neuronal dysfunction. In this study, we characterized 
      astrocytic and microglial response in SCA1 using a comprehensive array of mouse 
      models. We have discovered that astrocytes and microglia are activated very early 
      in SCA1 pathogenesis even when mutant ATXN1 expression was limited to Purkinje 
      neurons. Glial activation occurred in the absence of neuronal death, suggesting 
      that glial activation results from signals emanating from dysfunctional neurons. 
      Finally, in all different models examined glial activation closely correlated 
      with disease progression, supporting the development of glial-based biomarkers to 
      follow disease progression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a late onset autosomal 
      dominant cerebellar ataxia, caused by CAG triplet repeat expansion in the ATXN1 
      gene. The frequency of SCA1 occurrence is more in Southern India than in other 
      regions as observed from hospital-based studies. However there are no reports on 
      variability of CAG repeat expansion, phenotype-genotype association and founder 
      mutations in a homogenous population from India. METHODS: Genomic DNA isolated 
      from buccal mouthwash of the individuals in the cohort was used for PCR-based 
      diagnosis of SCA1. Subsequently SNP's found within the ATXN1 loci were identified 
      by Taqman allelic discrimination assays. Significance testing of the 
      genotype-phenotype associations was calculated by Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA test with 
      post-hoc Dunnett's test and Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: By 
      genetic analysis of an affected population in Southern India we identified 21 
      pre-symptomatic individuals including four that were well past the average age of 
      disease onset of 44 years, 16 symptomatic and 63 normal individuals. All 
      pre-symptomatic cases harbor "pure" expansions of greater than 40 CAGs. 
      Genotyping to test for the presence of two previously identified SNPs showed a 
      founder effect of the same repeat carrying allele as in the general Indian 
      population. We show that SCA1 disease onset is significantly delayed when 
      transmission of the disease is maternal. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of early 
      disease onset in individuals with a paternally inherited allele could serve as 
      valuable information for clinicians towards early detection of SCA1 in patients 
      with affected fathers. Identification of older pre-symptomatic individuals (n = 
      4) in our cohort among individuals with a shared genetic and environmental 
      background, suggests that second site genetic or epigenetic modifiers might 
      significantly affect SCA1 disease progression. Moreover, such undetected SCA1 
      cases could underscore the true prevalence of SCA1 in India.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease of the cerebellum caused by a polyglutamine-repeat expansion in the 
      protein ATXN1. We have previously demonstrated that astrocytic activation occurs 
      early in pathogenesis, correlates with disease progression, and can occur when 
      mutant ATXN1 expression is limited to Purkinje neurons. We now show that 
      expression of glutamate and aspartate transporter, GLAST, is decreased in 
      cerebellar astrocytes in a mouse model of SCA1. This decrease occurs in non-cell 
      autonomous manner late in disease and correlates well with the loss of Purkinje 
      neurons. Astrogliosis or decreased neuronal activity does not correlate with 
      diminished GLAST expression. In addition, Bergmann glia remain capable of 
      transcriptional upregulation of GLAST in response to improvement in Purkinje 
      neurons supporting the notion of active neuron-glia crosstalk in disease.

TI  - Modulation of the age at onset in spinocerebellar ataxia by CAG tracts in various 
      genes.
PG  - 2444-55
LID - 10.1093/brain/awu174 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine-coding (CAG)n repeat expansions in seven different genes cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxias. Although the size of the expansion is negatively 
      correlated with age at onset, it accounts for only 50-70% of its variability. To 
      find other factors involved in this variability, we performed a regression 
      analysis in 1255 affected individuals with identified expansions (spinocerebellar 
      ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7), recruited through the European Consortium on 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxias, to determine whether age at onset is influenced by the 
      size of the normal allele in eight causal (CAG)n-containing genes (ATXN1-3, 6-7, 
      17, ATN1 and HTT). We confirmed the negative effect of the expanded allele and 
      detected threshold effects reflected by a quadratic association between age at 
      onset and CAG size in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 3 and 6. We also evidenced 
      an interaction between the expanded and normal alleles in trans in individuals 
      with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 6 and 7. Except for individuals with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, age at onset was also influenced by other 
      (CAG)n-containing genes: ATXN7 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2; ATXN2, ATN1 and 
      HTT in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3; ATXN1 and ATXN3 in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 6; and ATXN3 and TBP in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7. This suggests that 
      there are biological relationships among these genes. The results were partially 
      replicated in four independent populations representing 460 Caucasians and 216 
      Asian samples; the differences are possibly explained by ethnic or geographical 
      differences. As the variability in age at onset is not completely explained by 
      the effects of the causative and modifier sister genes, other genetic or 
      environmental factors must also play a role in these diseases.

TI  - The histone deacetylase HDAC3 is essential for Purkinje cell function, 
      potentially complicating the use of HDAC inhibitors in SCA1.
PG  - 3733-45
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddu081 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a pathogenic glutamine repeat expansion in the protein ataxin-1 
      (ATXN1). One likely mechanism mediating pathogenesis is excessive transcriptional 
      repression induced by the expanded ATXN-1. Because ATXN1 binds HDAC3, a Class I 
      histone deacetylase (HDAC) that we have found to be required for ATXN1-induced 
      transcriptional repression, we tested whether genetically depleting HDAC3 
      improves the phenotype of the SCA1 knock-in mouse (SCA1(154Q/2Q)), the most 
      physiologically relevant model of SCA1. Given that HDAC3 null mice are embryonic 
      lethal, we used for our analyses a combination of HDAC3 haploinsufficient and 
      Purkinje cell (PC)-specific HDAC3 null mice. Although deleting a single allele of 
      HDAC3 in the context of SCA1 was insufficient to improve cerebellar and cognitive 
      deficits of the disease, a complete loss of PC HDAC3 was highly deleterious both 
      behaviorally, with mice showing early onset ataxia, and pathologically, with 
      progressive histologic evidence of degeneration. Inhibition of HDAC3 may yet have 
      a role in SCA1 therapy, but our study provides cautionary evidence that this 
      approach could produce untoward effects. Indeed, the neurotoxic consequences of 
      HDAC3 depletion could prove relevant, wherever pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC3 
      is being contemplated, in disorders ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration.

AB  - We evaluated the contributions of various polyglutamine (polyQ) disease genes to 
      Parkinson's disease (PD). We compared the distributions of polyQ repeat lengths 
      in 8 common genes (ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, ATN1, and HTT) in 
      299 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant PD (ADPD) and 329 normal controls. 
      We also analyzed the possibility of genetic interactions between ATXN1 and ATXN2, 
      ATXN2 and ATXN3, and ATXN2 and CACNA1A. Intermediate-length polyQ expansions (>24 
      Qs) of ATXN2 were found in 7 ADPD patients and no controls (7/299 = 2.34% and 
      0/329 = 0%, respectively; p = 0.0053 < 0.05/8 after Bonferroni correction). These 
      patients showed typical L-DOPA-responsive PD phenotypes. Conversely, no 
      significant differences in polyQ repeat lengths were found between the ADPD 
      patients and the controls for the other 7 genes. Our results may support the 
      hypothesis that ATXN2 polyQ expansion is a specific predisposing factor for 
      multiple neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Ataxin-1 and ataxin-2 intermediate-length PolyQ expansions in amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis.
PG  - 2315-20
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0b013e318278b618 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence suggests that intermediate-length polyglutamine 
      (PolyQ) expansions in the ataxin-2 (ATXN-2) gene are a risk factor for 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This work was undertaken with the aim to 
      investigate the frequency of ataxin-1 (ATXN-1) and ATXN-2 PolyQ expansions in a 
      cohort of patients with sporadic ALS (sALS) and patients with familial ALS (fALS) 
      from southern Italy. METHODS: We assessed the PolyQ lengths of ATXN-1 and ATXN-2 
      in 405 patients with sALS, 13 patients with fALS, and 296 unrelated controls 
      without history of neurodegenerative disorders. RESULTS: We found significantly 
      higher intermediate PolyQ expansions >/= 32 for ATXN-1 alleles and >/= 28 for ATXN-2 
      alleles in the sALS cohort (ATXN-1: ALS, 7.07% vs controls, 2.38%; p = 0.0001; 
      ATXN-2: ALS, 2.72% vs controls, 0.5%; p = 0.001). ATXN-1 CAT and ATXN-2 CAA 
      interruptions were detected in patients with ALS only. Age at onset, site of 
      onset, and sex were not significantly related to the ATXN-1 or ATXN-2 PolyQ 
      repeat length expansions. CONCLUSIONS: Both ATXN-1 and ATXN-2 PolyQ intermediate 
      expansions are independently associated with an increased risk for ALS.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease that results from a pathogenic glutamine-repeat expansion in the protein 
      ataxin-1 (ATXN1). Although the functions of ATXN1 are still largely unknown, 
      there is evidence to suggest that ATXN1 plays a role in regulating gene 
      expression, the earliest process known to go awry in SCA1 mouse models. In this 
      study, we show that ATXN1 reduces histone acetylation, a post-translational 
      modification of histones associated with enhanced transcription, and represses 
      histone acetyl transferase-mediated transcription. In addition, we find that 
      depleting the Leucine-rich Acidic Nuclear Protein (LANP)-an ATXN1 binding 
      inhibitor of histone acetylation-reverses aspects of SCA1 neuritic pathology.

      contribute to SCA1.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by expansion of a glutamine-encoding repeat in ataxin 1 (ATXN1). 
      In all known polyglutamine diseases, the glutamine expansion confers toxic 
      functions onto the protein; however, the mechanism by which this occurs remains 
      enigmatic, in light of the fact that the mutant protein apparently maintains 
      interactions with its usual partners. Here we show that the expanded 
      polyglutamine tract differentially affects the function of the host protein in 
      the context of different endogenous protein complexes. Polyglutamine expansion in 
      ATXN1 favours the formation of a particular protein complex containing RBM17, 
      contributing to SCA1 neuropathology by means of a gain-of-function mechanism. 
      Concomitantly, polyglutamine expansion attenuates the formation and function of 
      another protein complex containing ATXN1 and capicua, contributing to SCA1 
      through a partial loss-of-function mechanism. This model provides mechanistic 
      insight into the molecular pathogenesis of SCA1 as well as other polyglutamine 
      diseases.

      analysis".
PG  - 287-295

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1; OMIM: #164400) is an autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia caused by an expansion of CAG repeat, which encodes 
      polyglutamine, in the ataxin-1 (ATXN1) gene. Length of polyglutamine in the ATXN1 
      protein is the critical determinant of pathogenesis of this disease. Molecular 
      diagnosis of SCA1 is usually undertaken by assessing the length of CAG repeat 
      configuration using primers spanning this configuration. However, this 
      conventional method may potentially lead to misdiagnosis in assessing 
      polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat length, since CAT interruptions may be present 
      within the CAG repeat configuration, not only in normal controls but also in 
      neurologically symptomatic subjects. We developed a new method for assessing 
      actual CAG repeat numbers not interrupted by CAT sequences. Polymerase chain 
      reaction using a primer pair labeled with two different fluorescences followed by 
      restriction enzyme digestion with SfaNI which recognizes the sequence 
      "GCATC(N)(5)", lengths of actual CAG repeats that encode polyglutamine were 
      directly detected. We named this method "dual fluorescence labeled 
      PCR-restriction fragment length analysis". We found that numbers of actual CAG 
      repeat encoding polyglutamine do not overlap between our cohorts of normal 
      chromosomes (n=385) and SCA1 chromosomes (n=5). We conclude that the present 
      method is a useful way for molecular diagnosis of SCA1.

TI  - Case control analysis of repeat expansion size in ataxia.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurological diseases. The expansion of unstable microsatellite 
      repeats has been identified as the underlying pathogenic cause of 10 subtypes of 
      autosomal dominant SCAs. The aetiology of sporadic SCA is unknown. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effect of large normal repeats in patients 
      presenting with sporadic or familial ataxia compared to a control population. The 
      size of the expansion was determined using a fluorescent PCR approach in 10 
      common SCA genes: SCA-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 (CACNA1A), 
      SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), SCA-17 (TBP) 
      and DRPLA (ATN1), in 165 ataxia patients and 307 controls of Welsh origin. There 
      was no difference between cases and controls in the distribution of the large 
      normal alleles, or in the distribution of the combined CAG repeats. The normal 
      allele distribution in the Welsh population was largely similar to that of other 
      Caucasian populations. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of large normal 
      repeats on the susceptibility to develop ataxia.

TI  - Multiplex families with multiple system atrophy.
PG  - 545-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) has been considered a sporadic disease, 
      without patterns of inheritance. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of 
      4 multiplex families with MSA, including clinical genetic aspects. DESIGN: 
      Clinical and genetic study. SETTING: Four departments of neurology in Japan. 
      Patients Eight patients in 4 families with parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and 
      autonomic failure with age at onset ranging from 58 to 72 years. Two siblings in 
      each family were affected with these conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical 
      evaluation was performed according to criteria by Gilman et al. Trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the responsible genes for the spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 
      series and for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) was evaluated by 
      polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequence analysis of coding regions in the 
      alpha-synuclein gene was performed. RESULTS: Consanguineous marriage was observed 
      in 1 of 4 families. Among 8 patients, 1 had definite MSA, 5 had probable MSA, and 
      2 had possible MSA. The most frequent phenotype was MSA with predominant 
      parkinsonism, observed in 5 patients. Six patients showed pontine atrophy with 
      cross sign or slitlike signal change at the posterolateral putaminal margin or 
      both on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Possibilities of hereditary ataxias, 
      including SCA1 (ataxin 1, ATXN1), SCA2 (ATXN2), Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3 
      (ATXN1), SCA6 (ATXN1), SCA7 (ATXN7), SCA12 (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory 
      subunit B, beta isoform; PP2R2B), SCA17 (TATA box binding protein, TBP) and DRPLA 
      (atrophin 1; ATN1), were excluded, and no mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene 
      were found. CONCLUSIONS: Findings in these multiplex families suggest the 
      presence of familial MSA with autosomal recessive inheritance and a genetic 
      predisposition to MSA. Molecular genetic approaches focusing on familial MSA are 
      expected to provide clues to the pathogenesis of MSA.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat dynamic mutation identifying susceptibility in familial and 
      sporadic chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.
PG  - 73-9
AB  - Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) has a strong hereditary component, but an 
      understanding of predisposition genes is poor. Anticipation with familial CLL has 
      been reported, although the molecular mechanism is unknown. Expansion of 
      trinucleotide repeat sequences underlies anticipation observed in 
      neurodegenerative disease. A polymerase chain reaction-based assay was used to 
      analyse the stability of ten CCG- and CAG-trinucleotide repeat tracts in 18 CLL 
      families and 140 patients with the sporadic form of the disease. The study 
      suggests that anticipation, if it occurs in CLL, is not linked to CCG- and 
      CAG-repeat expansion, however, variation in repeat length at certain loci 
      (FRA16A) may permit identification of susceptible family members. In addition, 
      polymorphisms with prognostic significance were identified. These were high 
      length (but not expanded) repeats at FRA11B (P = 0.01), ATXN1 (P = 0.032) and 
      ATXN3 (P = 0.022), all associated with poor risk disease.

TI  - Patterns of CAG repeat interruptions in SCA1 and SCA2 genes in relation to repeat 
      instability.
PG  - 236-47
AB  - About 3% of the human genome is composed of simple sequence repeats and many of 
      these sequences occur within genes. These repeats are often polymorphic in a 
      normal population and their expansion in specific genes leads to a number of 
      hereditary neurological diseases. Normal variants of disease-related genes 
      contain either pure or interrupted repeats, and the postulated function of the 
      interruptions is to prevent repeat expansions. Their structural role in the 
      repeat tracts of genes and transcripts awaits detailed characterization. In this 
      study, we have determined the SCA1 and SCA2 genotypes in a Polish population and 
      found significant differences in allele spectra and frequencies from those 
      reported for other populations. They are discussed in relation to the repeat 
      expansion mechanism and disease incidence. We postulate that the dynamic mutation 
      of the genes SCA1 (also ATX1 or ataxin 1) and SCA2 (also ATX2 or ataxin 2) may 
      begin from the expansion of long pure repeat tracts without the prior loss of 
      interruptions. A simple way of cost-effective allelotyping of CAG repeat regions 
      in the SCA1 and SCA2genes is also shown. The reliable SSCP/duplex analysis 
      presented here may be the method of choice for the systematic searching of genes 
      for known and novel interrupted repeats.
