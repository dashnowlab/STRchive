TI  - De novo missense variants in the PP2A regulatory subunit PPP2R2B in a 
      neurodevelopmental syndrome: potential links to mitochondrial dynamics and 
      spinocerebellar ataxias.

AB  - The heterotrimeric protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex catalyzes about half of 
      Ser/Thr dephosphorylations in eukaryotic cells. A CAG repeat expansion in the 
      neuron-specific protein PP2A regulatory subunit PPP2R2B gene causes 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12). We established five monoallelic missense 
      variants in PPP2R2B (four confirmed as de novo) as a cause of intellectual 
      disability with developmental delay (R149P, T246K, N310K, E37K, I427T). In 
      addition to moderate to severe intellectual disability and developmental delay, 
      affected individuals presented with seizures, microcephaly, aggression, 
      hypotonia, as well as broad-based or stiff gait. We used biochemical and cellular 
      assays, including a novel luciferase complementation assay to interrogate PP2A 
      holoenzyme assembly and activity, as well as deregulated mitochondrial dynamics 
      as possible pathogenic mechanisms. Cell-based assays documented impaired ability 
      of PPP2R2B missense variants to incorporate into the PP2A holoenzyme, localize to 
      mitochondria, induce fission of neuronal mitochondria, and dephosphorylate the 
      mitochondrial fission enzyme dynamin-related protein 1. AlphaMissense-based 
      pathogenicity prediction suggested that an additional seven unreported missense 
      variants may be pathogenic. In conclusion, our studies identify loss-of-function 
      at the PPP2R2B locus as the basis for syndromic intellectual disability with 
      developmental delay. They also extend PPP2R2B-related pathologies from 
      neurodegenerative (SCA12) to neurodevelopmental disorders and suggests that 
      altered mitochondrial dynamics may contribute to mechanisms.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) is a rare autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by abnormal CAG repeat expansion in the PPP2R2B 
      gene. This disease is classically characterized by action tremor, dysarthria, 
      ataxia, and hyperreflexia. There are limited reports regarding the non-motor 
      symptoms in patients with SCA 12. We investigated the frequency and factors 
      associated with the selected non-motor symptoms in patients with SCA 12. METHODS: 
      Genetically diagnosed (CAG repeats > 43) and symptomatic cases of SCA 12 were 
      included in the study. Motor severity was assessed using the Scale for the 
      Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment 
      Scale (TETRAS). Non-motor symptoms such as depression, autonomic function, and 
      cognition were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the 
      Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Autonomic Dysfunction (SCOPA-AUT), and 
      the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), respectively. RESULTS: The mean age of 
      the cohort with 34 SCA12 patients was 64.87 years (standard deviation 6.844). In 
      this study, 21 patients (61.76%) had either mild or moderate cognitive 
      impairment, almost equally frequent in early and advanced cases. Similarly a 
      number of patients demonstrated evidence of moderate and severe depression. The 
      SARA score was strongly associated with the MoCA score, and CAG repeat length 
      could independently predict the MoCA score in this cohort. Autonomic symptoms 
      were commonly present, with the majority of the patients experiencing urinary 
      symptoms. DISCUSSION: Non-motor symptoms are common in SCA12 patients, even in 
      the early stages of the condition. Timely detection and treatment of these 
      symptoms may improve the therapeutic outcome and quality of life for SCA12 
      patients. The diverse symptoms of SCA12 perhaps indicate a widespread 
      neurodegeneration beyond the cerebellum or its direct connections.

AB  - There is an obvious clinical-pathological overlap between essential tremor and 
      some known tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansion disorders. The aim is 
      to analyse whether these short tandem repeat genes, including ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, TBP, BEAN1, NOP56, DAB1, ATN1, 
      SADM12 and FMR1, are associated with familial essential tremor patients. Genetic 
      analysis of repeat sizes in tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansions was 
      performed in a large cohort of 515 familial essential tremor probands and 300 
      controls. The demographic and clinical features among carriers of pathogenic 
      expansions, intermediate repeats and non-carriers were compared. A total of 18 
      out of 515 (18/515, 3.7%) patients were found to have repeats expansions, 
      including 12 cases (12/515, 2.5%) with intermediate repeat expansions (one ATXN1, 
      eight TBP, two FMR1, one ATN1), and six cases (6/515, 1.2%) with pathogenic 
      expansions (one ATXN1, one ATXN2, one ATXN8OS, one PPP2R2B, one FMR1, one 
      SAMD12). There were no statistically significant differences in intermediate 
      repeats compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, there were no significant 
      differences in demographics and clinical features among individuals with 
      pathogenic expansions, intermediate repeat expansions carriers and non-carriers. 
      Our study indicates that the intermediate repeat expansion in tremor-associated 
      short tandem repeat expansions does not pose an increased risk for essential 
      tremor, and rare pathogenic expansion carriers have been found in the familial 
      essential tremor cohort. The diagnosis of essential tremor based solely on 
      clinical symptoms remains a challenge in distinguishing it from known short 
      tandem repeat expansions diseases with overlapping clinical-pathological 
      features.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) is a neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a CAG/CTG repeat expansion at the PPP2R2B locus. OBJECTIVE: We 
      investigated how the CAG repeat expansion within the PPP2R2B 7B7D transcript 
      influences the expression of Bbeta1 and a potential protein containing a long 
      polyserine tract. METHODS: Transcript and protein expression were measured using 
      quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blot, respectively, in an SK-N-MC cell model 
      that overexpresses the full-length PPP2R2B 7B7D transcript. The apoptotic effect 
      of a protein containing a long polyserine tract on SK-N-MC cells was evaluated 
      using caspase 3/7 activity. RESULTS: The CAG repeat expansion increases the 
      expression of the PPP2R2B 7B7D transcript, as well as Bbeta1 protein, in an SK-N-MC 
      cell model in which the full-length PPP2R2B 7B7D transcript is overexpressed. The 
      CAG repeat expansion within the 7B7D transcript is translated into a long 
      polyserine tract that triggers apoptosis in SK-N-MC cells. CONCLUSIONS: The SCA12 
      mutation leads to overexpression of PPP2R2B Bbeta1 and to expression of a protein 
      containing a long polyserine tract; both these effects potentially contribute to 
      SCA12 pathogenesis. (c) 2024 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia type-12 (SCA12) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by 
      tandem CAG repeat expansion in the 5'-UTR/non-coding region of PPP2R2B. Molecular 
      pathology of SCA12 has not been studied in the context of CAG repeats, and no 
      appropriate models exist. We found in human SCA12-iPSC-derived neuronal lineage 
      that expanded CAG in PPP2R2B transcript forms nuclear RNA foci and were found to 
      sequester variety of proteins. Further, the ectopic expression of transcript 
      containing varying length of CAG repeats exhibits non-canonical repeat-associated 
      non-AUG (RAN) translation in multiple frames in HEK293T cells, which was further 
      validated in patient-derived neural stem cells using specific antibodies. mRNA 
      sequencing of the SCA12 and control neurons have shown a network of crucial 
      transcription factors affecting neural fate, in addition to alteration of various 
      signaling pathways involved in neurodevelopment. Altogether, this study 
      identifies the molecular signatures of SCA12 disorder using patient-derived 
      neuronal cell lines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) is a neurological disease characterized by 
      action tremor in upper arms. Although its high heritability and prevalence 
      worldwide, its etiology and association with other diseases are still unknown. 
      METHOD: We investigated 10 common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), including SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, SCA36, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA) in 92 early-onset familial ET pedigrees in China collected from 
      2016 to 2022. RESULT: We found one SCA12 proband carried 51 CAG repeats within 
      PPP2R2B gene and one SCA3 proband with intermediate CAG repeats (55) with ATXN3 
      gene. The other 90 ET probands all had normal repeat expansions. CONCLUSION: 
      Tremor can be the initial phenotype of certain SCA. For early-onset, familial ET 
      patients, careful physical examinations are needed before genetic SCA screening.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a genetically 
      heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders generally caused by single 
      nucleotide variants (SNVs) or indels in coding regions or by repeat expansions in 
      coding and noncoding regions of SCA genes. Copy number variants (CNVs) have now 
      also been reported for 3 genes-ITPR1, FGF14, and SPTBN2-but not all SCA genes 
      have been screened for CNVs as the underlying cause of the disease in patients. 
      In this study, we aim to assess the prevalence of CNVs encompassing 36 known SCA 
      genes. METHODS: A cohort of patients with cerebellar ataxia who were referred to 
      the University Medical Center Groningen for SCA genetic diagnostics was selected 
      for this study. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was 
      performed using the Infinium Global Screening Array. Following data processing, 
      genotyping data were uploaded into NxClinical software to perform CNV analysis 
      per patient and to visualize identified CNVs in 36 genes with allocated SCA 
      symbols. The clinical relevance of detected CNVs was determined using evidence 
      from studies based on PubMed literature searches for similar CNVs and phenotypic 
      features. RESULTS: Of the 338 patients with cerebellar ataxia, we identified 
      putative clinically relevant CNV deletions in 3 patients: an identical deletion 
      encompassing ITPR1 in 2 patients, who turned out to be related, and a deletion 
      involving PPP2R2B in another patient. Although the CNV deletion in ITPR1 was 
      clearly the underlying cause of SCA15 in the 2 related patients, the clinical 
      significance of the deletion in PPP2R2B remained unknown. DISCUSSION: We showed 
      that CNVs detectable with the limited resolution of SNP array are a very rare 
      cause of SCA. Nevertheless, we suggest adding CNV analysis alongside SNV analysis 
      to SCA gene diagnostics using next-generation sequencing approaches, at least for 
      ITPR1, to improve the genetic diagnostics for patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinocerebellar ataxia type-12 (SCA12) is a rare form of SCA, most 
      commonly reported from the Indian Agarwal and related families. In this study we 
      describe the clinical, genetic, and radiological characteristics of a sizeable 
      cohort of genetically proven SCA12. METHODS: A retrospective chart-review of the 
      genetically confirmed SCA12 patients from our centre. The demographic, clinical, 
      and investigation findings were reviewed. Correlation of expanded repeats length 
      with various demographic and clinical features were studied. RESULTS: A total of 
      49 patients (34 males, 42 families) were included of which 79.6% belonged to 
      Agarwal community. The mean age at onset and age at presentation were 46.38 +/- 
      11.7 years and 53.16 +/- 12.78 years respectively. The most common initial symptom 
      was tremor (73.5%), followed by ataxia (18.4%). At presentation, 95.9% of the 
      patients had tremor with predominant distribution in the bilateral upper limbs 
      (85.7%). At presentation, 73.5% of patients had ataxia and 22.4% had cognitive 
      dysfunction. The mean CAG repeat length in PPP2R2B in the expanded allele was 
      53.26 +/- 6.10 (40-72). The lowest pathogenic expanded repeat sizes in PPP2R2B 
      recorded in our cohort was 40 & 42 repeats from two patients with a consistent 
      clinical phenotype. Another unusual phenotype was the presence of prominent 
      myoclonus. There was no significant correlation between the age at onset of 
      symptoms and the repeat size of CAG repeat. CONCLUSION: SCA12 is not confined to 
      a single ethnicity. Upper limb tremor and ataxia were the most common 
      presentation. Unusual presentation may cause diagnostic confusion especially when 
      recorded in patients from non-Aggarwal families.

AB  - PURPOSE: Investigate single nucleotide variants and short tandem repeats in 39 
      genes related to spinocerebellar ataxia in clinical and pathologically defined 
      cohorts of multiple system atrophy. METHODS: Exome sequencing was conducted in 28 
      clinical multiple system atrophy patients to identify single nucleotide variants 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes. Novel variants were validated in two 
      independent disease cohorts: 86 clinically diagnosed multiple system atrophy 
      patients and 166 pathological multiple system atrophy cases. Expanded repeat 
      alleles in spinocerebellar ataxia genes were evaluated in 36 clinically diagnosed 
      multiple system atrophy patients, and CAG/CAA repeats in TATA-Box Binding Protein 
      (TBP, causative of SCA17) were screened in 216 clinical and pathological multiple 
      system atrophy patients and 346 controls. RESULTS: No known pathogenic 
      spinocerebellar ataxia single nucleotide variants or pathogenic range expanded 
      repeat alleles of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, AXTN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, 
      and TBP were detected in any clinical multiple system atrophy patients. However, 
      four novel variants were identified in four spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes 
      across three multiple system atrophy patients. Additionally, four multiple system 
      atrophy patients (1.6%) and one control (0.3%) carried an intermediate length 41 
      TBP CAG/CAA repeat allele (OR = 4.11, P = 0.21). There was a significant 
      association between the occurrence of a repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) and an increased risk of multiple system atrophy (OR = 1.64, P = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: Occurrence of TBP CAG/CAA repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) is significantly associated with increased multiple system atrophy risk. 
      This discovery warrants further investigation and supports a possible genetic 
      overlap of multiple system atrophy with SCA17.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnostic workup for choreiform movement disorders including 
      Huntington's disease (HD) and those mimicking HD like phenotype is complex. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to genetically define HD and HD-like 
      presentations in an Indian cohort. We also describe HTT-CAG expansion manifesting 
      as neuroferritinopathy-like disorder in four families from Punjab in India. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: 159 patients clinically diagnosed as HD and HD-like 
      presentations from various tertiary neurology clinics were referred to our centre 
      (CSIR-IGIB) for genetic investigations. As a first tier test, CAG-TNR for HTT was 
      performed and subsequently HD-negative samples were screened for JPH3 (HDL2), TBP 
      (SCA17), ATN1 (DRPLA), PPP2R2B (SCA12) and GGGGCC expansion in C9orf72 gene. Four 
      families presenting as neuroferritinopathy-like disorder were also investigated 
      for HTT-CAG expansion. RESULTS: 94 of 159 (59%) patients were found to have 
      expanded HTT-CAG repeats. Pathogenic repeat expansion in JPH3, TBP, ATN1 and 
      C9orf72 were not found in HD negative cases. Two patients were positive for 
      SCA12-CAG expansion in pathogenic length, whereas 5 cases harboured TBP-CAG 
      repeats falling in reduced penetrance range of 41- 48 repeats for SCA17. Four 
      unrelated families, presented with atypical chorea and brain MRI findings 
      suggestive of basal ganglia abnormalities mimicking neuroferritinopathy were 
      found to harbour HTT-CAG expansion. CONCLUSION: We present SCA12 as a new 
      reported phenocopy of HD which should be considered for diagnostic workout along 
      with SCA17 for HD-like syndromes. This study also illustrates the necessity, to 
      consider evolving HD like phenotype, as a clinical diagnosis for cases with 
      initial manifestations depicting neuroferritinopathy.

TI  - Live births following preimplantation genetic testing for dynamic mutation 
      diseases by karyomapping: a report of three cases.
PG  - 539-548
LID - 10.1007/s10815-020-01718-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic defects (PGT-M) is a 
      beneficial strategy for the patients suffering from a Mendelian disease, which 
      could protect their offspring from inheriting the disease. The purpose of this 
      study is to report the effectiveness of PGT-M based on karyomapping for three 
      cases of dynamic mutation diseases with trinucleotide repeat expansion. METHODS: 
      PGT-M was carried out on three couples, whose family members were diagnosed with 
      Huntington's disease or spinocerebellar ataxias 2 or 12. The whole genome 
      amplification was obtained using the multiple displacement amplification (MDA) 
      method. Then, karyomapping was performed to detect the allele that is carrying 
      the trinucleotide repeat expansion using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
      linkage analyses, and the copy number variations (CNVs) of the embryos were also 
      identified. Prenatal diagnosis was performed to validate the accuracy of PGT-M. 
      RESULTS: PGT-M was successfully performed on the three couples, and they accepted 
      the transfers of euploid blastocysts without the relevant pathogenic allele. The 
      clinical pregnancies were acquired and the prenatal diagnosis of the three 
      families confirmed the effectiveness of karyomapping. The three born babies were 
      healthy and free of the pathogenic alleles HTT, ATXN2, or PPP2R2B corresponding 
      to Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxias 2 or 12, respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: This study shows that karyomapping is a highly powerful and efficient 
      approach for dynamic mutation detection in preimplantation embryos. In this work, 
      we first report the birth of healthy babies that are free of the pathogenic gene 
      for dynamic mutation diseases in patients receiving PGT-M by karyomapping.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type-12 (SCA12) is a neurological disorder caused due to 
      triplet (CAG) repeat expansion in 5' UTR of PPP2R2B. It is one of the most 
      prominent SCA-subtype in Indian population and till date no patient specific 
      models have been described. Human-induced-pluripotent-stem cell (HiPSC) based 
      disease modelling has become the next generation tool for studying various human 
      pathologies. In the present study we established three SCA12 patient specific 
      iPSC lines. All the generated lines have shown pluripotency markers, normal 
      karyotype, in-vitro three germ layers differentiation potential, vector 
      clearance, SCA12 mutation, parental genomic identity and contamination free 
      culture.

TI  - Postural Tremor and Ataxia Progression in Spinocerebellar Ataxias.
PG  - 492

LID - 492
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postural tremor can sometimes occur in spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs). However, the prevalence and clinical characteristics of postural tremor 
      in SCAs are poorly understood, and whether SCA patients with postural tremor have 
      different ataxia progression is not known. METHODS: We studied postural tremor in 
      315 patients with SCA1, 2, 3, and 6 recruited from the Clinical Research 
      Consortium for Spinocerebellar Ataxias (CRC-SCA), which consists of 12 
      participating centers in the United States, and we evaluated ataxia progression 
      in these patients from January 2010 to August 2012. RESULTS: Among 315 SCA 
      patients, postural tremor was most common in SCA2 patients (SCA1, 5.8%; SCA2, 
      27.5%; SCA3, 12.4%; SCA6, 16.9%; p = 0.007). SCA3 patients with postural tremor 
      had longer CAG repeat expansions than SCA3 patients without postural tremor 
      (73.67 +/- 3.12 vs. 70.42 +/- 3.96, p = 0.003). Interestingly, SCA1 and SCA6 patients 
      with postural tremor had a slower rate of ataxia progression (SCA1, beta = -0.91, p 
      < 0.001; SCA6, beta = -1.28, p = 0.025), while SCA2 patients with postural tremor 
      had a faster rate of ataxia progression (beta = 1.54, p = 0.034). We also found that 
      the presence of postural tremor in SCA2 patients could be influenced by repeat 
      expansions of ATXN1 (beta = -1.53, p = 0.037) and ATXN3 (beta = 0.57, p = 0.018), 
      whereas postural tremor in SCA3 was associated with repeat lengths in TBP (beta = 
      0.63, p = 0.041) and PPP2R2B (beta = -0.40, p = 0.032). DISCUSSION: Postural tremor 
      could be a clinical feature of SCAs, and the presence of postural tremor could be 
      associated with different rates of ataxia progression. Genetic interactions 
      between ataxia genes might influence the brain circuitry and thus affect the 
      clinical presentation of postural tremor.

TI  - Clinical behaviour of spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 and intermediate length 
      abnormal CAG repeats in PPP2R2B.
PG  - 27-36
LID - 10.1093/brain/aww269 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by CAG repeat expansion in the PPP2R2B gene. Previously, the causal length 
      of CAG repeats ascribed to SCA12 was more than 51; however, a few reports have 
      also described unusual occurrence of CAG repeat length 36-51 repeats among 
      patients of different geographical population, with atypical clinical 
      association. From our systematic search for SCA12 in a genetic screening 
      programme, we have identified a large number of SCA12 cases. In this study, we 
      specifically describe the clinical behaviour of 18 patients who harbour CAG 
      repeats in the range of 43-50 and compare their clinical behaviour with patients 
      carrying typical pathogenic threshold length of 51 CAG repeats. Unsurprisingly, 
      we observed that the clinical characteristics were similar to those of typical 
      SCA12 phenotype, with large variability in the age at onset. Radiologically, we 
      observed a variable degree of cerebro-cerebellar degeneration along with white 
      matter changes that do not correlate with the disease severity. We define a new 
      pathogenic threshold of CAG-43 to be pathogenic for SCA12 diagnosis and also 
      describe the clinical profiles of two biallelic CAG expansion carriers. We also 
      propose that SCA12 might not be that restricted in terms of occurrence in other

AB  - OBJECTIVE: SCA12 is a progressive autosomal-dominant disorder, caused by a 
      CAG/CTG repeat expansion in PPP2R2B on chromosome 5q32, and characterized by 
      tremor, gait ataxia, hyperreflexia, dysmetria, abnormal eye movements, anxiety, 
      depression, and sometimes cognitive impairment. Neuroimaging has demonstrated 
      cerebellar and cortical atrophy. We now present the neuropathology of the first 
      autopsied SCA12 brain and utilize cell models to characterize potential 
      mechanisms of SCA12 neurodegeneration. METHODS: A fixed SCA12 brain was examined 
      using gross, microscopic, and immunohistochemical methods. The effect of the 
      repeat expansion on PPP2R2B Bbeta1 expression was examined in multiple cell types by 
      transient transfection of constructs containing the PPP2R2B Bbeta1 promoter region 
      attached to a luciferase reporter. The neurotoxic effect of PPP2R2B 
      overexpression was examined in transfected rat primary neurons. RESULTS: 
      Neuropathological investigation revealed enlarged ventricles, marked cerebral 
      cortical atrophy and Purkinje cell loss, less-prominent cerebellar and pontine 
      atrophy, and neuronal intranuclear ubiquitin-positive inclusions, consistent with 
      Marinesco bodies, which did not stain for long polyglutamine tracts, 
      alpha-synuclein, tau, or transactive response DNA-binding protein 43. Reporter 
      assays demonstrated that the region of PPP2R2B containing the repeat functions as 
      a promoter, and that promoter activity increases with longer repeat length and is 
      dependent on cell type, repeat sequence, and sequence flanking the repeat. 
      Overexpression of PPP2R2B in primary cortical neurons disrupted normal 
      morphology. CONCLUSIONS: SCA12 involves extensive, but selective, 
      neurodegeneration distinct from Alzheimer's disease, synucleinopathies, 
      tauopathies, and glutamine expansion diseases. SCA12 neuropathology may arise 
      from the neurotoxic effect of repeat-expansion-induced overexpression of PPP2R2B.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association of repeat expansion size in 10 common 
      degenerative hereditary ataxia genes with essential tremor. These genes were 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 
      (CACNA1A), SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), 
      SCA-17 (TBP) and dentatorubral-pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA) (ATN1). METHODS: 
      Genetic analysis of repeat size in 10 degenerative hereditary ataxia loci was 
      performed in 323 essential tremor patients and 299 controls enrolled at Columbia 
      University. To test for differences in the allele distribution between patients 
      and controls, a CLUMP analysis was performed. RESULTS: None of the essential 
      tremor patients had a repeat expansion in the intermediate or pathogenic range. 
      Significant differences in the distribution of repeats in the 'normal' range for 
      SCA2 and SCA8 (both p </= 0.02) were observed between essential tremor patients and 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      SCA loci are not associated with essential tremor.

TI  - Identification of 46 CAG repeats within PPP2R2B as probably the shortest 
      pathogenic allele for SCA12.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) is predominantly characterized 
      by action tremor, followed by slowly progressive cerebellar dysfunction. It is a 
      very rare disorder and only identified in certain countries so far. The current 
      appreciation for phenotypic and genotypic features of SCA12 is still limited. 
      METHODS: We investigated CAG copies within PPP2R2B in 29 patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia who are excluded from the most common SCA subtypes 
      including SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6. The medical data of patients carrying 
      abnormal expanded PPP2R2B allele were reviewed and summarized. RESULTS: We found 
      that 3 patients carried 53, 46 and 54 CAG repeats respectively, while the other 
      26 cases harbored CAG repeats less than 30. The probably shortest pathogenic 
      allele of 46 repeats was detected in one kindred typically experiencing action 
      tremor. Additionally, compared to the prominent cerebellar ataxia, nystagmus and 
      dysphagia seem to be rare in our SCA12 patients. CONCLUSIONS: SCA12 might not be 
      as rare in Chinese as previously assumed. The identification of the shortest 
      pathogenic allele helps to define the minimal limit implicated in the disease 
      onset. Moreover, the disease manifestations distinct from other SCA subtypes 
      could help clinicians to provide timely genetic counseling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are autosomal-dominant 
      neurodegenerative diseases that are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. 
      SCAs are characterized by a range of neurological symptoms. SCA12 is an 
      autosomal-dominant (AD) ataxia caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation in a 
      presumed promoter region of the gene PPP2R2B in a non-coding region on chromosome 
      5q32. This study sought to determine changes in different positions in a single 
      Uyghur SCA12 pedigree by measuring the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and 
      fractional anisotropy (FA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single Uyghur pedigree was 
      collected and was confirmed to possess SCA12 by genetic diagnosis, among which 13 
      cases were patients and 54 cases were "healthy" individuals. Five patients were 
      presymptomatic and 15 individuals selected as a control group were examination in 
      the same time. DTI was performed on a 1.5T scanner, with b=1000 s/mm2 and 15 
      directions. ADC and FA were measured by regions of interest positioned in the 
      corticospinal tract at the level of the pons (pons), superior peduncle (SCP), 
      middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), cerebellar cortex (CeC), cerebral cortex (CC), 
      and cerebellar vermis (CV) white matter. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the 
      ADC was significantly elevated in the CeC, SCP, CC, and CV regions in SCA12 
      patients. The FA significantly decreased in the CC region in SCA12 patients and 
      the CC and CV regions in SCA12 presymptomatic patients. The course of the 
      disease, SARA score, and ADC values in CV showed highly positive correlations. 
      CONCLUSIONS: SCA12 pedigree patients exhibited microstructural damage in the 
      brain white matter. The damage in white matter fiber may first occur in the CC 
      and CV regions in SCA12 presymptomatic patients. The ADC values in the CV region 
      could reflect disease severity in SCA12 patients.

AB  - Intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions in ataxin 2 are a risk factor for 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The polyglutamine tract is encoded by a 
      trinucleotide repeat in a coding region of the ataxin 2 gene (ATXN2). Noncoding 
      nucleotide repeat expansions in several genes are also associated with 
      neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. For example, hexanucleotide repeat 
      expansions located in a noncoding region of C9ORF72 are the most common cause of 
      ALS. We sought to assess a potential larger role of noncoding nucleotide repeat 
      expansions in ALS. We analyzed the nucleotide repeat lengths of 6 genes (ATXN8, 
      ATXN10, PPP2R2B, NOP56, DMPK, and JPH3) that have previously been associated with 
      neurologic or neuromuscular disorders, in several hundred sporadic patients with 
      ALS and healthy control subjects. We report no association between ALS and repeat 
      length in any of these genes, suggesting that variation in the noncoding 
      repetitive regions in these genes does not contribute to ALS.

AB  - We analyzed the association between PPP2R2B gene CAG repeat length and Alzheimer 
      disease (AD) susceptibility in the Japanese population. Blood samples were 
      collected from 218 late-onset AD patients and 86 controls. DNA fragments 
      containing the target CAG repeat region were amplified using polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR). PCR products were sequenced using ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer. 
      The mean CAG repeat length did not differ significantly between the control and 
      AD groups. In contrast, the frequency of CAG repeats shorter than 15 was 
      significantly higher in AD group, specifically in the AD with APOE4 subgroup, 
      than in the control group. The results suggest that CAG repeat lengths in the 
      PPP2R2B gene may be potential genetic markers for AD susceptibility in the 
      Japanese population.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To map the disease locus and to identify a gene mutation in a 
      Japanese family with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia. DESIGN: A genome-wide 
      linkage analysis was performed using the Affymetrix genome-wide human 
      single-nucleotide polymorphism array containing 909 622 single-nucleotide 
      polymorphisms. Direct nucleotide sequencing of a candidate gene was performed. 
      SETTING: Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine and Tokyo University 
      Graduate School of Medicine. Patients  Four affected and 6 healthy individuals in 
      a family with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia. RESULTS: One locus on 
      chromosome 5q had a multipoint logarithm of odds score of 2.408, the theoretical 
      maximum. This locus was flanked by markers rs681591 and rs32582 and includes 
      PPP2R2B (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory subunit B, beta isoform), the 
      causative gene of autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia 12 (SCA12). However, 
      unlike SCA12, no CAG repeat expansions in the promoter region and no nucleotide 
      substitution or insertion-deletion mutations in the exons of the PPP2R2B gene 
      were found. CONCLUSION: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia mapping to 
      5q31-q33.1 has no CAG repeat expansion or other mutations of the PPP2R2B gene.

AB  - PPP2R2B, a protein widely expressed in neurons, regulates the protein phosphatase 
      2A (PP2A) activity for dephosphorylation of tau and other substrates. CAG repeat 
      expansion at the 5'-end of the PPP2R2B gene causes autosomal dominant 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 12. In the present study, we investigated the roles 
      of CAG repeats and flanking cis elements and the associated proteins in 
      controlling PPP2R2B expression. Deletion/site-directed mutagenesis, in silico 
      searches and cDNA overexpression revealed that CREB1 and SP1 bind to the 
      conserved sequence upstream the CAG repeats to up-regulate PPP2R2B expression, 
      whereas TFAP4 binds to the conserved sequence downstream the CAG repeats to 
      down-regulate PPP2R2B expression. The binding of CREB1, SP1, and TFAP4 to the 
      PPP2R2B promoter was further confirmed by DNA pull-down and ChIP-PCR assays. CAG 
      repeats itself also function as a cis element to up-regulate PPP2R2B expression 
      as AT repeat length has no effect on PPP2R2B expression. Together, our data 
      provide evidence that CREB1, SP1, and TFAP4 play roles in modulating PPP2R2B 
      expression, thus offering a mechanism of regulating PP2A activity as the 
      treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with abnormal PP2A activity.

AB  - The neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia 12 (SCA12) is caused by CAG 
      repeat expansion in the non-coding region of the PPP2R2B gene. PPP2R2B encodes

      of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzyme. We show here that in PC12 cells 
      and hippocampal neurons, cell stressors induced a rapid translocation of 
      PP2A/Bbeta2 to mitochondria to promote apoptosis. Conversely, silencing of 
      PP2A/Bbeta2 protected hippocampal neurons against free radical-mediated, 
      excitotoxic, and ischemic insults. Evidence is accumulating that the 
      mitochondrial fission/fusion equilibrium is an important determinant of cell 
      survival. Accordingly, we found that Bbeta2 expression induces mitochondrial 
      fragmentation, whereas Bbeta2 silencing or inhibition resulted in mitochondrial 
      elongation. Based on epistasis experiments involving Bcl2 and core components of 
      the mitochondrial fission machinery (Fis1 and dynamin-related protein 1), 
      mitochondrial fragmentation occurs upstream of apoptosis and is both necessary 
      and sufficient for hippocampal neuron death. Our data provide the first example 
      of a proapoptotic phosphatase that predisposes to neuronal death by promoting 
      mitochondrial division and point to a possible imbalance of the mitochondrial 
      morphogenetic equilibrium in the pathogenesis of SCA12.

TI  - PPP2R2B CAG repeat length in the Han Chinese in Taiwan: Association analyses in 
      neurological and psychiatric disorders and potential functional implications.
PG  - 124-9
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.30785 [doi]
AB  - PPP2R2B, a protein widely expressed in neurons throughout the brain, regulates 
      the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity for the microtubule-associated protein 
      tau and other substrates. Altered PP2A activity has been implicated in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 12, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other tauopathies. 
      Through a case-control study and a reporter assay, we investigated the 
      association of PPP2R2B CAG repeat polymorphism with Taiwanese AD, essential 
      tremor (ET), Parkinson's disease (PD), and schizophrenia and clarified the 
      functional implication of this polymorphism. The distribution of the alleles was 
      not significantly different between patients and controls, with 68.6-76.1% 
      alleles at lengths of 10, 13, and 16 triplets. No expanded alleles were detected 
      in either group. However, the frequency of the individuals carrying the short 5-, 
      6-, and 7-triplet alleles was notably higher in patients with AD (5/180 [2.8%], 
      Fisher's exact test, P = 0.003; including 2 homozygotes) and ET (4/132 [3.0%], 
      Fisher's exact test, P < 0.001) than in the controls (1/625 [0.2%]). The PPP2R2B 
      transcriptional activity was significantly lower in the luciferase reporter 
      constructs containing the (CAG)(5-7) allele than in those containing the common 
      10-, 13-, and 16-triplet alleles in both neuroblastoma and embryonic kidney 
      cells. Therefore, our preliminary results suggest that the PPP2R2B gene CAG 
      repeat polymorphism may be functional and may, in part, play a role in conferring 
      susceptibility to AD and ET in Taiwan.

TI  - Case control analysis of repeat expansion size in ataxia.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurological diseases. The expansion of unstable microsatellite 
      repeats has been identified as the underlying pathogenic cause of 10 subtypes of 
      autosomal dominant SCAs. The aetiology of sporadic SCA is unknown. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effect of large normal repeats in patients 
      presenting with sporadic or familial ataxia compared to a control population. The 
      size of the expansion was determined using a fluorescent PCR approach in 10 
      common SCA genes: SCA-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 (CACNA1A), 
      SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), SCA-17 (TBP) 
      and DRPLA (ATN1), in 165 ataxia patients and 307 controls of Welsh origin. There 
      was no difference between cases and controls in the distribution of the large 
      normal alleles, or in the distribution of the combined CAG repeats. The normal 
      allele distribution in the Welsh population was largely similar to that of other 
      Caucasian populations. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of large normal 
      repeats on the susceptibility to develop ataxia.

TI  - Expanded trinucleotide repeats in the TBP/SCA17 gene mapped to chromosome 6q27 
      are associated with schizophrenia.
PG  - 131-6
AB  - Schizophrenia has a complex and non-Mendelian mode of inheritance. Recently, 
      trinucleotide repeat (TNR)-containing genes have been considered as the candidate 
      genes predisposing to schizophrenia. The purpose of this study was to determine 
      whether a genetic association could be observed between schizophrenia and the TNR 
      polymorphisms within the KLHL1AS/SCA8, PPP2R2B/SCA12, and TBP/SCA17 genes. We 
      studied 100 unrelated schizophrenia patients and 124 controls without evident 
      neurodegenerative or psychiatric disorders. The overall allele frequency 
      distributions of the KLHL1AS/SCA8 and PPP2R2B/SCA12 genes were not significantly 
      different between the schizophrenic patients and the control subjects (P>0.05). 
      The allele frequency distribution in the schizophrenic patients was significantly 
      different from that in the controls at the TBP/SCA17 gene (P=0.0149), with an 
      increased frequency of 36 repeats in the patients and two patients carrying 45 
      TNR expansions were identified. TBP/SCA17 is the TATA box binding protein gene 
      mapped to chromosome 6q27. The study suggests that TNR expansions of the 
      TBP/SCA17 gene may contribute to the genetic risk of schizophrenia in rare cases.

TI  - SCA12 is a rare locus for autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia: a study of an 
      Indian family.
PG  - 117-21
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 12 (SCA12) is an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia 
      (ADCA) described in a single family with a CAG repeat expansion in the PPP2R2B 
      gene. We screened 247 index cases, including 145 families with ADCA, for this 
      expansion. An expanded repeat ranging from 55 to 61 triplets was detected in 6 
      affected and 3 unaffected individuals at risk in a single family from India. The 
      association of the PPP2R2B CAG repeat expansion with disease in this new family 
      provides additional evidence that the mutation is causative.

TI  - SCA-12: Tremor with cerebellar and cortical atrophy is associated with a CAG 
      repeat expansion.
PG  - 299-303
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical and neuroradiologic features of a new 
      spinocerebellar ataxia, SCA-12, in the index family. BACKGROUND: The authors 
      recently linked SCA-12 to a novel CAG repeat expansion on chromosome 5q31-33 that 
      is located within the 5' region of PPP2R2B, a gene encoding a brain-specific 
      regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A. METHODS: Neurologic features of the 
      proband and nine symptomatic relatives in the first SCA-12 family were compiled 
      and, in some individuals, related to changes found on brain MRI or CT. RESULTS: 
      SCA-12 typically presented in the 4th decade of life with action tremor of the 
      head or arms (present in 10/10 of the affected individuals). Hyperreflexia (8/10) 
      was a common feature, and cerebellar signs (8/10), including ataxia, dysmetria, 
      and dysarthria, developed gradually but were less prominent and disabling than 
      cerebellar dysfunction in other SCA. Subtle parkinsonian features (9/10) and 
      dementia (2/10) were observed in later stages of SCA-12, and psychiatric 
      symptoms, including depression, anxiety, or delusions, were present in some 
      affected family members (4/10). Two individuals studied had nondisabling 
      neurologic signs neonatally, including nystagmus and lower extremity dystonia. 
      Brain images of affected individuals revealed cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. 
      CONCLUSIONS: SCA-12 is a slowly progressive, autosomal dominant, 
      neurodegenerative disorder that differs from other SCA in that it typically 
      presents with action tremor in patients in their mid 30s and usually includes 
      hyperreflexia and subtle parkinsonian signs. Cerebellar dysfunction, including 
      gait ataxia, is relatively nondisabling, and cognitive or psychiatric disorders 
      may occur. Neuroradiologic studies reveal atrophy of the cerebellum and cerebral 
      cortex.
