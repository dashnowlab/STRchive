TI  - Mini-heterochromatin domains constrain the cis-regulatory impact of SVA 
      transposons in human brain development and disease.

AB  - SVA (SINE (short interspersed nuclear element)-VNTR (variable number of tandem 
      repeats)-Alu) retrotransposons remain active in humans and contribute to 
      individual genetic variation. Polymorphic SVA alleles harbor gene regulatory 
      potential and can cause genetic disease. However, how SVA insertions are 
      controlled and functionally impact human disease is unknown. Here we dissect the 
      epigenetic regulation and influence of SVAs in cellular models of X-linked 
      dystonia parkinsonism (XDP), a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an SVA 
      insertion at the TAF1 locus. We demonstrate that the KRAB zinc finger protein 
      ZNF91 establishes H3K9me3 and DNA methylation over SVAs, including polymorphic 
      alleles, in human neural progenitor cells. The resulting mini-heterochromatin 
      domains attenuate the cis-regulatory impact of SVAs. This is critical for XDP 
      pathology; removal of local heterochromatin severely aggravates the XDP molecular 
      phenotype, resulting in increased TAF1 intron retention and reduced expression. 
      Our results provide unique mechanistic insights into how human polymorphic 
      transposon insertions are recognized and how their regulatory impact is 
      constrained by an innate epigenetic defense system.

TI  - Stability of Mosaic Divergent Repeat Interruptions in X-Linked 
      Dystonia-Parkinsonism.
PG  - 1145-1153
LID - 10.1002/mds.29809 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: X-Linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is an adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder characterized by rapidly progressive dystonia and 
      parkinsonism. Mosaic Divergent Repeat Interruptions affecting motif Length and 
      Sequence (mDRILS) were recently found within the TAF1 SVA repeat tract and were 
      shown to associate with repeat stability and age at onset in XDP, specifically 
      the AGGG [5'-SINE-VNTR-Alu(AGAGGG)(2)AGGG(AGAGGG)(n)] mDRILS. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study aimed to investigate the stability of mDRILS frequencies and stability of 
      (AGAGGG)(n) repeat length during transmission in parent-offspring pairs. METHODS: 
      Fifty-six families (n = 130) were investigated for generational transmission of 
      repeat length and mDRILS. The mDRILS stability of 16 individuals was assessed at 
      two sampling points 1 year apart. DNA was sequenced with long-read technologies 
      after long-range polymerase chain reaction amplification of the TAF1 SVA. Repeat 
      number and mDRILS were detected with Noise-Cancelling Repeat Finder (NCRF). 
      RESULTS: When comparing the repeat domain, 51 of 65 children had either 
      contractions or expansions of the repeat length. The AGGG frequency remained 
      stable across generations at 0.074 (IQR: 0.069-0.078) (z = -0.526; P = 0.599). 
      However, the median AGGG frequency in children with an expansion (0.072 [IQR: 
      0.066-0.076]) was lower compared with children with retention or contraction 
      (0.080 [IQR: 0.073-0.083]) (z = -0.007; P = 0.003). In a logistic regression 
      model, the AGGG frequency predicted the outcome of either expansion or 
      retention/contraction when including repeat number and sex as covariates 
      (beta = 80.7; z-score = 2.63; P = 0.0085). The AGGG frequency varied slightly over 
      1 year (0.070 [IQR: 0.063-0.080] to 0.073 [IQR: 0.069-0.078]). CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results show that a higher AGGG frequency may stabilize repeats across 
      generations. This highlights the importance of further investigating mDRILS as a 
      disease-modifying factor with generational differences. (c) 2024 The Authors.

      Parkinsonism.
PG  - 23-30
LID - 10.15605/jafes.037.S6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: X-linked Dystonia Parkinsonism (XDP) is associated with a SINE-VNTR- 
      Alu (SVA) retrotransposon insertion in an intron of the TAF1 gene that alters 
      gene transcription and splicing. In this study, we determined if the SVA 
      insertion introduces glucocorticoid (GC)-responsive cis-regulatory elements that 
      may contribute to dysregulated TAF1 transcription and XDP disease progression. 
      METHODOLOGY: We performed in silico analysis to identify potential GC receptor 
      (GR) binding sites within the XDP-SVA. We also conducted promoter-reporter assays 
      on HeLa and HEK293T cells to assess the intrinsic promoter activity of three 
      XDP-SVA variants representing different hexameric repeat lengths associated with 
      differences in disease onset. We treated XDP fibroblast cell models with GR 
      agonist (CORT) or antagonist (RU486), then subjected TAF1 and the XDP-associated 
      aberrant transcript, TAF1-32i to gene expression analysis. RESULTS: A 
      transcription factor binding site search revealed three binding sites for GR 
      within the XDP-SVA-two within the SINE region and one in the Alu region. 
      Promoter-reporter assays showed induction of XDP-SVA promoter activity upon CORT 
      treatment that was dependent on the cell line and XDP-SVA hexamer repeat length. 
      Gene expression analysis showed that baseline TAF1 levels differed between 
      control and patient fibroblast cell lines, and treatment with CORT led to an 
      increasing trend in the expression of the aberrant TAF1-32i transcript but did 
      not reach statistical significance. Treatment with RU486 increased TAF1 mRNA 
      expression only in the control cell lines. CONCLUSION: Using reporter assays, the 
      XDP-SVA was shown to exhibit CORT-dependent transcriptional activation. Gene 
      expression analysis also showed that GC signaling may influence TAF1 and TAF1-32i 
      expression, possibly through interaction with the XDP-SVA. Our data provide a 
      potential link between stress and XDP progression.

TI  - Repeat-Associated Non-AUG Translation of AGAGGG Repeats that Cause X-Linked 
      Dystonia-Parkinsonism.
PG  - 2284-2289
LID - 10.1002/mds.29183 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by the intronic insertion of a SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposon 
      carrying an (AGAGGG)(n) repeat expansion in the TAF1 gene. The molecular 
      mechanisms by which this mutation causes neurodegeneration remain elusive. 
      OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether (AGAGGG)(n) repeats undergo repeat-associated 
      non-AUG (RAN) translation, a pathogenic mechanism common among repeat expansion 
      diseases. METHODS: XDP-specific RAN translation reporter plasmids were generated, 
      transfected in HEK293 cells, and putative dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) were 
      detected by Western blotting. Immunocytochemistry was performed in COS-7 cells to 
      determine the subcellular localization of one DPR. RESULTS: We detected putative 
      DPRs from two reading frames, supporting the translation of poly-(Glu-Gly) and 
      poly-(Arg-Glu) species. XDP RAN translation initiates within the (AGAGGG)(n) 
      sequence and poly-(Glu-Gly) DPRs formed nuclear inclusions in transfected cells. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our work provides the first in-vitro proof of principle 
      that the XDP-linked (AGAGGG)(n) repeat expansions can undergo RAN translation. (c)

TI  - Factors influencing reduced penetrance and variable expressivity in X-linked 
      dystonia-parkinsonism.

AB  - X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder 
      that primarily affects adult Filipino men. It is caused by a founder 
      retrotransposon insertion in TAF1 that contains a hexanucleotide repeat, the 
      number of which differs among the patients and correlates with the age at disease 
      onset (AAO) and other clinical parameters. A recent work has identified 
      additional genetic modifiers of age-associated penetrance in XDP, bringing to 
      light the DNA mismatch repair genes MSH3 and PMS2. Despite X-linked recessive 
      inheritance, a minor subset of patients are female, manifesting the disease via 
      various mechanisms such as homozygosity, imbalanced X-chromosome inactivation, or 
      aneuploidy. Here, we summarize and discuss clinical and genetic aspects of XDP, 
      with a focus on variable disease expressivity as a consequence of subtle genetic 
      differences within a seemingly homogenous population of patients.

TI  - Variation in TAF1 expression in female carrier induced pluripotent stem cells and 
      human brain ontogeny has implications for adult neostriatum vulnerability in 
      X-linked Dystonia Parkinsonism.

AB  - X-linked Dystonia-Parkinsonism (XDP) is an inherited, X-linked, adult-onset 
      movement disorder characterized by degeneration in the neostriatum. No 
      therapeutics alter disease progression. The mechanisms underlying regional 
      differences in degeneration and adult onset are unknown. Developing therapeutics 
      requires a deeper understanding of how XDP-relevant features vary in health and 
      disease. XDP is possibly due, in part, to a partial loss of TAF1 function. A 
      disease-specific SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposon insertion occurs within 
      intron 32 of TAF1, a subunit of TFIID involved in transcription initiation. While 
      all XDP males are usually clinically affected, females are heterozygous carriers 
      generally not manifesting the full syndrome. As a resource for disease modeling, 
      we characterized eight iPSC lines from three XDP female carrier individuals for X 
      chromosome inactivation status and identified clonal lines that express either 
      the wild-type X or XDP haplotype. Furthermore, we characterized XDP-relevant 
      transcript expression in neurotypical humans, and found that SVA-F expression 
      decreases after 30 years of age in the brain and that TAF1 is decreased in most 
      female samples. Uniquely in the caudate nucleus, TAF1 expression is not sexually 
      dimorphic and decreased after adolescence. These findings indicate that 
      regional-, age- and sex-specific mechanisms regulate TAF1, highlighting the 
      importance of disease-relevant models and postmortem tissue. We propose that the 
      decreased TAF1 expression in the adult caudate may synergize with the 
      XDP-specific partial loss of TAF1 function in patients, thereby passing a minimum 
      threshold of TAF1 function, and triggering degeneration in the 
      neostriatum.Significance StatementXDP is an inherited, X-linked, adult-onset 
      movement disorder characterized by degeneration in the neostriatum. No 
      therapeutics alter disease progression. Developing therapeutics requires a deeper 
      understanding of how XDP-relevant features vary in health and disease. XDP is 
      possibly due to a partial loss of TAF1 function. While all XDP males are usually 
      affected, females are heterozygous carriers generally not manifesting the full 
      syndrome. As a resource for disease modeling, we characterized eight stem cell 
      lines from XDP female carrier individuals. Furthermore, we found that, uniquely 
      in the caudate nucleus, TAF1 expression decreases after adolescence in healthy 
      humans. We hypothesize that the decrease of TAF1 after adolescence in human 
      caudate, in general, may underlie the vulnerability of the adult neostriatum in 
      XDP.

AB  - While many genetic causes of movement disorders have been identified, modifiers 
      of disease expression are largely unknown. X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) 
      is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a SINE-VNTR-Alu(AGAGGG)n retrotransposon 
      insertion in TAF1, with a polymorphic (AGAGGG)n repeat. Repeat length and 
      variants in MSH3 and PMS2 explain  approximately 65% of the variance in age at onset (AAO) in 
      XDP. However, additional genetic modifiers are conceivably at play in XDP, such 
      as repeat interruptions. Long-read nanopore sequencing of PCR amplicons from XDP 
      patients (n = 202) was performed to assess potential repeat interruption and 
      instability. Repeat-primed PCR and Cas9-mediated targeted enrichment confirmed 
      the presence of identified divergent repeat motifs. In addition to the canonical 
      pure SINE-VNTR-Alu-5'-(AGAGGG)n, we observed a mosaic of divergent repeat motifs 
      that polarized at the beginning of the tract, where the divergent repeat 
      interruptions varied in motif length by having one, two, or three nucleotides 
      fewer than the hexameric motif, distinct from interruptions in other 
      disease-associated repeats, which match the lengths of the canonical motifs. All 
      divergent configurations occurred mosaically and in two investigated brain 
      regions (basal ganglia, cerebellum) and in blood-derived DNA from the same 
      patient. The most common divergent interruption was AGG 
      [5'-SINE-VNTR-Alu(AGAGGG)2AGG(AGAGGG)n], similar to the pure tract, followed by 
      AGGG [5'-SINE-VNTR-Alu(AGAGGG)2AGGG(AGAGGG)n], at median frequencies of 0.425 
      (IQR: 0.42-0.43) and 0.128 (IQR: 0.12-0.13), respectively. The mosaic AGG motif 
      was not associated with repeat number (estimate = -3.8342, P = 0.869). The mosaic 
      pure tract frequency was associated with repeat number (estimate = 45.32, P = 
      0.0441) but not AAO (estimate = -41.486, P = 0.378). Importantly, the mosaic 
      frequency of the AGGG negatively correlated with repeat number after adjusting 
      for age at sampling (estimate = -161.09, P = 3.44 x 10-5). When including the 
      XDP-relevant MSH3/PMS2 modifier single nucleotide polymorphisms into the model, 
      the mosaic AGGG frequency was associated with AAO (estimate = 155.1063, P = 
      0.047); however, the association dissipated after including the repeat number 
      (estimate = -92.46430, P = 0.079). We reveal novel mosaic divergent repeat 
      interruptions affecting both motif length and sequence (DRILS) of the canonical 
      motif polarized within the SINE-VNTR-Alu(AGAGGG)n repeat. Our study illustrates: 
      (i) the importance of somatic mosaic genotypes; (ii) the biological plausibility 
      of multiple modifiers (both germline and somatic) that can have additive effects 
      on repeat instability; and (iii) that these variations may remain undetected 
      without assessment of single molecules.

AB  - X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is a progressive adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by insertion of a SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) 
      retrotransposon in the TAF1 gene. The SVA retrotransposon contains a CCCTCT 
      hexameric repeat tract of variable length, whose length is inversely correlated 
      with age at onset. This places XDP in a broader class of repeat expansion 
      diseases, characterized by the instability of their causative repeat mutations. 
      Here, we observe similar inverse correlations between CCCTCT repeat length with 
      age at onset and age at death and no obvious correlation with disease duration. 
      To gain insight into repeat instability in XDP we performed comprehensive 
      quantitative analyses of somatic instability of the XDP CCCTCT repeat in blood 
      and in seventeen brain regions from affected males. Our findings reveal repeat 
      length-dependent and expansion-based instability of the XDP CCCTCT repeat, with 
      greater levels of expansion in brain than in blood. The brain exhibits 
      regional-specific patterns of instability that are broadly similar across 
      individuals, with cerebellum exhibiting low instability and cortical regions 
      exhibiting relatively high instability. The spectrum of somatic instability in 
      the brain includes a high proportion of moderate repeat length changes of up to 5 
      repeats, as well as expansions of ~ 20- > 100 repeats and contractions of ~ 20-40 
      repeats at lower frequencies. Comparison with HTT CAG repeat instability in 
      postmortem Huntington's disease brains reveals similar brain region-specific 
      profiles, indicating common trans-acting factors that contribute to the 
      instability of both repeats. Analyses in XDP brains of expansion of a different 
      SVA-associated CCCTCT located in the LIPG gene, and not known to be 
      disease-associated, reveals repeat length-dependent expansion at overall lower 
      levels relative to the XDP CCCTCT repeat, suggesting that expansion propensity 
      may be modified by local chromatin structure. Together, the data support a role 
      for repeat length-dependent somatic expansion in the process(es) driving the 
      onset of XDP and prompt further investigation into repeat dynamics and the 
      relationship to disease.

AB  - X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative movement 
      disorder, caused by a founder retrotransposon insertion in an intron of the TAF1 
      gene. This insertion contains a polymorphic hexanucleotide repeat (CCCTCT)(n), 
      the length of which inversely correlates with the age at disease onset (AAO) and 
      other clinical parameters, aligning XDP with repeat expansion disorders. 
      Nevertheless, many other pathogenic mechanisms are conceivably at play in XDP, 
      indicating that in contrast to other repeat disorders, the (CCCTCT)(n) repeat may 
      not be the actual (or only) disease cause. Here, we summarize and discuss genetic 
      and molecular aspects of XDP, highlighting the role of the hexanucleotide repeat 
      in age-related disease penetrance and expressivity.

TI  - Brain Regional Differences in Hexanucleotide Repeat Length in X-Linked 
      Dystonia-Parkinsonism Using Nanopore Sequencing.
PG  - e608

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our study investigated the presence of regional differences in 
      hexanucleotide repeat number in postmortem brain tissues of 2 patients with 
      X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP), a combined dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome 
      modified by a (CCCTCT)(n) repeat within the causal SINE-VNTR-Alu retrotransposon 
      insertion in the TAF1 gene. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from blood and 
      postmortem brain samples, including the basal ganglia and cortex from both 
      patients and from the cerebellum, midbrain, and pituitary gland from 1 patient. 
      Repeat sizing was performed using fragment analysis, small-pool PCR-based 
      Southern blotting, and Oxford nanopore sequencing. RESULTS: The basal ganglia (p 
      < 0.001) and cerebellum (p < 0.001) showed higher median repeat numbers and 
      higher degrees of repeat instability compared with blood. CONCLUSIONS: Somatic 
      repeat instability may predominate in brain regions selectively affected in XDP, 
      thereby hinting at its potential role in disease manifestation and modification.

TI  - Simultaneous Screening of the FRAXA and FRAXE Loci for Rapid Detection of FMR1 
      CGG and/or AFF2 CCG Repeat Expansions by Triplet-Primed PCR.

AB  - Moderate to hyper-expansion of trinucleotide repeats at the FRAXA and FRAXE 
      fragile sites, with or without concurrent hypermethylation, has been associated 
      with intellectual disability and other conditions. Unlike molecular diagnosis of 
      FMR1 CGG repeat expansions in FRAXA, current detection of AFF2 CCG repeat 
      expansions in FRAXE relies on low-throughput and otherwise inefficient techniques 
      combining Southern blot analysis and PCR. A novel triplet-primed PCR assay was 
      developed for simultaneous screening for trinucleotide repeat expansions at the 
      FRAXA and FRAXE fragile sites, and was validated using archived clinical samples 
      of known FMR1 and AFF2 genotypes. Population samples and FRAXE-affected samples 
      were sequenced for the evaluation of variations in the AFF2 CCG repeat structure. 
      The duplex assay accurately identified expansions at the FMR1 and AFF2 
      trinucleotide repeat loci. On Sanger sequencing of the AFF2 CCG repeat, the 
      single-nucleotide polymorphism variant rs868914124(C) that effectively adds two 
      CCG repeats at the 5'-end, was enriched in the Malay population and with short 
      repeats (<11 CCGs), and was present in all six expanded AFF2 alleles of this 
      study. All expanded AFF2 alleles contained multiple non-CCG interruptions toward 
      the 5'-end of the repeat. A sensitive, robust, and rapid assay has been developed 
      for the simultaneous detection of expansion mutations at the FMR1 and AFF2 
      trinucleotide repeat loci, simplifying screening for FRAXA- and FRAXE-associated 
      disorders.

TI  - Pathogenic SREK1 decrease in Huntington's disease lowers TAF1 mimicking X-linked 
      dystonia parkinsonism.
PG  - 2207-2219
LID - 10.1093/brain/awaa150 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease and X-linked dystonia parkinsonism are two monogenic basal 
      ganglia model diseases. Huntington's disease is caused by a 
      polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene leading 
      to several toxic interactions of both the expanded CAG-containing mRNA and the 
      polyglutamine-containing protein, while X-linked dystonia parkinsonism is caused 
      by a retrotransposon insertion in the TAF1 gene, which decreases expression of 
      this core scaffold of the basal transcription factor complex TFIID. SRSF6 is an 
      RNA-binding protein of the serine and arginine-rich (SR) protein family that 
      interacts with expanded CAG mRNA and is sequestered into the characteristic 
      polyglutamine-containing inclusion bodies of Huntington's disease brains. Here we 
      report decreased levels of the SRSF6 interactor and regulator SREK1-another SR 
      protein involved in RNA processing-which includes TAF1 as one of its targets. 
      This led us to hypothesize that Huntington's disease and X-linked dystonia 
      parkinsonism pathogeneses converge in TAF1 alteration. We show that diminishing 
      SRSF6 through RNA interference in human neuroblastoma cells leads to a decrease 
      in SREK1 levels, which, in turn, suffices to cause diminished TAF1 levels. We 
      also observed decreased SREK1 and TAF1 levels in striatum of Huntington's disease 
      patients and transgenic model mice. We then generated mice with neuronal 
      transgenic expression of SREK1 (TgSREK1 mice) that, interestingly, showed 
      transcriptomic alterations complementary to those in Huntington's disease mice. 
      Most importantly, by combining Huntington's disease and TgSREK1 mice we verify 
      that SREK1 overexpression corrects TAF1 deficiency and attenuates striatal 
      atrophy and motor phenotype of Huntington's disease mice. Our results therefore 
      demonstrate that altered RNA processing upon SREK1 dysregulation plays a key role 
      in Huntington's disease pathogenesis and pinpoint TAF1 as a likely general 
      determinant of selective vulnerability of the striatum in multiple neurological 
      disorders.

TI  - Disease onset in X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism correlates with expansion of a 
      hexameric repeat within an SVA retrotransposon in TAF1.
PG  - E11020-E11028
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1712526114 [doi]
AB  - X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is a neurodegenerative disease associated 
      with an antisense insertion of a SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA)-type retrotransposon within 
      an intron of TAF1 This unique insertion coincides with six additional noncoding 
      sequence changes in TAF1, the gene that encodes TATA-binding protein-associated 
      factor-1, which appear to be inherited together as an identical haplotype in all 
      reported cases. Here we examined the sequence of this SVA in XDP patients (n = 
      140) and detected polymorphic variation in the length of a hexanucleotide repeat 
      domain, (CCCTCT)(n) The number of repeats in these cases ranged from 35 to 52 and 
      showed a highly significant inverse correlation with age at disease onset. 
      Because other SVAs exhibit intrinsic promoter activity that depends in part on 
      the hexameric domain, we assayed the transcriptional regulatory effects of 
      varying hexameric lengths found in the unique XDP SVA retrotransposon using 
      luciferase reporter constructs. When inserted sense or antisense to the 
      luciferase reading frame, the XDP variants repressed or enhanced transcription, 
      respectively, to an extent that appeared to vary with length of the hexamer. 
      Further in silico analysis of this SVA sequence revealed multiple motifs 
      predicted to form G-quadruplexes, with the greatest potential detected for the 
      hexameric repeat domain. These data directly link sequence variation within the 
      XDP-specific SVA sequence to phenotypic variability in clinical disease 
      manifestation and provide insight into potential mechanisms by which this 
      intronic retroelement may induce transcriptional interference in TAF1 expression.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease characterized by loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. SCA6 is caused 
      by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in CACNA1A, which encodes Cav2.1, alpha1A 
      subunit of P/Q-type calcium channel. However, the pathogenic mechanism and 
      effective therapeutic treatments are still unknown. Here, we have succeeded in 
      generating differentiated Purkinje cells that carry patient genes by combining 
      disease-specific iPSCs and self-organizing culture technologies. Patient-derived 
      Purkinje cells exhibit increased levels of full-length Cav2.1 protein but 
      decreased levels of its C-terminal fragment and downregulation of the 
      transcriptional targets TAF1 and BTG1. We further demonstrate that SCA6 Purkinje 
      cells exhibit thyroid hormone depletion-dependent degeneration, which can be 
      suppressed by two compounds, thyroid releasing hormone and Riluzole. Thus, we 
      have constructed an in vitro disease model recapitulating both ontogenesis and 
      pathogenesis. This model may be useful for pathogenic investigation and drug 
      screening.

AB  - X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP, DYT3), endemic in the Philippine island of 
      Panay, is characterized by the clinical onset with dystonia followed by 
      parkinsonism. We found a 35-year-old American male patient, originally from Panay 
      with typical XDP, has a 2-year history of parkinsonism, dystonia, and tremor. 
      Ancestral DYT3 haplotype and disease-specific SVA (short interspersed nuclear 
      element, variable number of tandem repeats, and Alu composite) retrotransposon 
      insertion were identified in the DYT3 proband and two female unaffected family 
      members. No mutation(s) and expression changes in peripheral blood lymphocytes 
      were observed in the TATA-binding protein-associated factor 1 gene (TAF1) or the 
      chemokine CXC motif receptor 3 gene (CXCR3) of the proband or other DYT3 
      carriers. These findings indicate blood DNA test has a diagnostic utility and 
      implications for genetic counseling in families with DYT3. In contrast, TAF1 and 
      CXCR3 gene expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes is not a suitable surrogate 
      disease marker for DYT3.

TI  - Deoxyribonucleic acid profiling analysis of 40 human thyroid cancer cell lines 
      reveals cross-contamination resulting in cell line redundancy and 
      misidentification.
PG  - 4331-41
LID - 10.1210/jc.2008-1102 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Cell lines derived from human cancers provide critical tools to study 
      disease mechanisms and develop novel therapies. Recent reports indicate that up 
      to 36% of cell lines are cross- contaminated. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated 40 reported 
      thyroid cancer-derived cell lines using short tandem repeat and single nucleotide 
      polymorphism array analysis. RESULTS: Only 23 of 40 cell lines tested have unique 
      genetic profiles. The following groups of cell lines are likely derivatives of 
      the same cell line: BHP5-16, BHP17-10, BHP14-9, and NPA87; BHP2-7, BHP10-3, 
      BHP7-13, and TPC1; KAT5, KAT10, KAT4, KAT7, KAT50, KAK1, ARO81-1, and MRO87-1; 
      and K1 and K2. The unique cell lines include BCPAP, KTC1, TT2609-C02, FTC133, 
      ML1, WRO82-1, 8505C, SW1736, Cal-62, T235, T238, Uhth-104, ACT-1, HTh74, KAT18, 
      TTA1, FRO81-2, HTh7, C643, BHT101, and KTC-2. The misidentified cell lines 
      included the DRO90-1, which matched the melanoma-derived cell line, A-375. The 
      ARO81-1 and its derivatives matched the HT-29 colon cancer cell line, and the 
      NPA87 and its derivatives matched the M14/MDA-MB-435S melanoma cell line. TTF-1 
      and Pax-8 mRNA levels were determined in the unique cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Many 
      of these human cell lines have been widely used in the thyroid cancer field for 
      the past 20 yr and are not only redundant, but not of thyroid origin. These 
      results emphasize the importance of cell line integrity, and provide the short 
      tandem repeat profiles for a panel of thyroid cancer cell lines that can be used 
      as a reference for comparison of cell lines from other laboratories.

TI  - Reduced neuron-specific expression of the TAF1 gene is associated with X-linked 
      dystonia-parkinsonism.
PG  - 393-406
AB  - X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is a movement disorder endemic to the 
      Philippines. The disease locus, DYT3, has been mapped to Xq13.1. In a search for 
      the causative gene, we performed genomic sequencing analysis, followed by 
      expression analysis of XDP brain tissues. We found a disease-specific SVA (short 
      interspersed nuclear element, variable number of tandem repeats, and Alu 
      composite) retrotransposon insertion in an intron of the TATA-binding 
      protein-associated factor 1 gene (TAF1), which encodes the largest component of 
      the TFIID complex, and significantly decreased expression levels of TAF1 and the 
      dopamine receptor D2 gene (DRD2) in the caudate nucleus. We also identified an 
      abnormal pattern of DNA methylation in the retrotransposon in the genome from the 
      patient's caudate, which could account for decreased expression of TAF1. Our 
      findings suggest that the reduced neuron-specific expression of the TAF1 gene is 
      associated with XDP.

TI  - Assignment of the dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome locus, DYT3, to a small region 
      within a 1.8-Mb YAC contig of Xq13.1.
PG  - 644-50
AB  - A YAC contig was constructed of Xq13.1 in order to sublocalize the X-linked 
      dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) syndrome locus, DYT3. The contig spans a region of 
      approximately 1.8 Mb and includes loci DXS453/DXS348/IL2R gamma/GJB1/CCG1/DXS559. 
      For the construction of the contig, nine sequence-tagged sites and four short 
      tandem repeat polymorphisms (STRPs) were isolated. The STRPs, designated as 
      4704#6 (DXS7113), 4704#7 (DXS7114), 67601 (DXS7117), and B4Pst (DXS7119) were 
      assigned to a region flanked by DXS348 proximally and by DXS559 distally. Their 
      order was DXS348/4704 #6/4704 #7/67601/B4Pst/DXS559. They were applied to the 
      analysis of allelic association and of haplotypes in 47 not-obviously-related XDP 
      patients and in 105 Filipino male controls. The same haplotype was found at loci 
      67601 (DXS7117) and B4Pst (DXS7119) in 42 of 47 patients. This percentage of 
      common haplotypes decreased at the adjacent loci. The findings, together with the 
      previous demonstration of DXS559 being the distal flanking marker of DYT3, assign 
      the disease locus to a small region in Xq13.1 defined by loci 67601 (DXS7117) and 
      B4Pst (DXS7119). The location of DYT3 was born out by the application of a newly 
      developed likelihood method for the analysis of linkage disequilibrium.

TI  - DXS106 and DXS559 flank the X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome locus (DYT3).
PG  - 114-7
AB  - The locus (DYT3) underlying the X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome (XDP) was 
      delineated within proximal Xq12-Xq13.1 by analysis of linkage, allelic 
      association, and haplotypes. Short tandem repeat polymorphisms at loci DXS227, 
      DXS559, DXS453, DXS106, DXS339, and DXS135 were studied. The occurrence of a 
      recombination within a three-generation family established DXS559 as the distal 
      flanking marker of DYT3. /phi/ and /delta/ values were determined as indicators 
      of the degree of allelic association between DYT3 and the six marker loci. In 
      addition, haplotype analysis was performed at the loci studied. The findings 
      establish DXS106 as the proximal flanking marker of DYT3. Given an approximate 
      distance between DXS106 and DXS559 of 3.0 Mb, isolation of DYT3 is now feasible 
      by positional cloning techniques.

TI  - Delineation of the dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome locus in Xq13.
PG  - 8245-8
AB  - The X chromosome-linked dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome (XDP) is a severe movement 
      disorder, characterized by both dystonia and parkinsonism. XDP is a genetically 
      homogeneous disorder. Known ancestry of all patients has been traced back to 
      Panay, Philippines, where the disease probably originated from a single mutation 
      (founder effect). The gene locus, DYT3, has been previously assigned to the 
      proximal long arm of the X chromosome (Xq12-q21.1). Using four dinucleotide 
      tandem repeat (DNTR) sequences from Xq13-derived yeast artificial chromosomes 
      (YACs), we further delineate DYT3 within Xq13. Observation of a recombination 
      event between DYT3 and DNTR locus 4548-7, derived from a YAC encompassing locus 
      DXS56, establishes 4548-7 as a distal flanking marker. Assignment of DYT3 to a 
      region in Xq13, flanked by loci 4548-7 and DXS159, is further supported by highly 
      significant allelic association between DYT3 and a total of four DNTR 
      loci--PY2-31, PY5-10, 4548-1, and 4548-7--located in a region defined by PGK1 and 
      DXS56. /phi/ and /delta/ values were 0.82/0.35, 0.78/0.42, 0.65/0.34, and 
      0.88/0.58 for PY2-31, PY5-10, 4548-1, and 4548-7 at P less than 10(-2), P less 
      than 10(-4), P less than 10(-3), and P less than 10(-6).
