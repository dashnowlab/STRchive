TI  - Immediate Postoperative Changes After Expansion Pharyngoplasty and Hypoglossal 
      Nerve Stimulation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are at an increased risk 
      for perioperative cardiopulmonary complications. Our objective was to assess the 
      postoperative effects of hypoglossal nerve stimulation implantation (HGNS) and 
      expansion pharyngoplasty (EP) on longitudinal sleep apnea measures as a surrogate 
      for respiratory complications. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal cohort 
      study of patients with OSA undergoing HGNS or EP. METHODS: Sleep studies were 
      performed with the NightOwl Mini peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) device. 
      Changes in apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and oximetry time below 90% (T90) were 
      assessed between two baseline PAT studies prior to surgery and nightly PAT 
      studies for the first postoperative nights (PON) 1-7, 10, and 14. RESULTS: Thirty 
      patients were enrolled (19 HGNS, 11 EP). The mean age was 52.6 years, 76.7% were 
      male, and the mean clinical baseline AHI was 29.8/h. There were no significant 
      changes in the AHI or T90 following HGNS implantation. Following EP, there was a 
      statistically significant mean increase in AHI of +19.2/h on PON1, +24.9/h on 
      PON2, and + 20/h on PON3 compared to baseline. T90 was also elevated after EP on 
      PON1, 4, and 5. The mean increase in T90 was +7.4% (95% CI 2.9, 11.9) on PON1 
      compared to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: In the immediate postoperative period, there 
      were no significant changes in AHI or hypoxemia after HGNS, suggesting that there 
      is no need for routine overnight observation after HGNS. There were significant 
      increases in AHI and hypoxemia after EP suggesting that postoperative disposition 
      should be considered on a case-by-case basis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III

LID - 10.1016/j.actbio.2024.11.038 [doi]
AB  - Split-thickness skin grafts are widely used to treat chronic wounds. Procedure 
      design requires surgeons to predict how much a patch of the patient's own skin 
      expands when it is meshed with rows of slits and stretched over a larger wound 
      area. Accurate prediction of graft expansion remains a challenge, with current 
      models overestimating the actual expansion, leading to suboptimal outcomes. 
      Inspired by the principles of mechanical metamaterials, we developed a model that 
      distinguishes between the kinematic rearrangement of structural elements and 
      their stretching, providing a more accurate prediction of skin graft expansion. 
      Our model was validated against extensive data from skin graft surgeries, 
      demonstrating vastly superior predictive capability compared to existing methods. 
      This metamaterial-inspired approach enables informed decision-making for 
      potentially improving healing outcomes. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Accurately 
      predicting the expansion of meshed skin grafts is crucial for minimizing patient 
      trauma and optimizing healing outcomes in reconstructive surgery. However, 
      current quantitative models, which treat grafts as tessellated trusses of rigid 
      bars, fail to accurately estimate graft expansion. We have uncovered the 
      mechanisms underlying skin graft expansion and developed a straightforward method 
      based on these findings. This method, designed for practical use by surgeons, 
      provides accurate predictions of graft expansion, as validated against extensive 
      data from skin graft surgeries.

AB  - Tissue expansion (TE) is the primary method for breast reconstruction after 
      mastectomy. In many cases, mastectomy patients undergo radiation treatment (XR). 
      Radiation is known to induce skin fibrosis and is one of the main causes for 
      complications during post-mastectomy breast reconstruction. TE, on the other 
      hand, induces a pro-regenerative response that culminates in growth of new skin. 
      However, the combined effect of XR and TE on skin mechanics is unknown. Here we 
      used the porcine model of TE to study the effect of radiation on skin fibrosis 
      through biaxial testing, histological analysis, and kinematic analysis of skin 
      deformation over time. We found that XR leads to stiffening of skin compared to 
      control based on a shift in the transition stretch (transition between a low 
      stiffness and an exponential stress-strain region characteristic of collagenous 
      tissue) and an increase in the high modulus (modulus computed with stress-stretch 
      data past the transition point). The change in transition stretch can be 
      explained by thicker, more aligned collagen fiber bundles measured in histology 
      images. Skin subjected to both XR+TE showed similar microstructure to controls as 
      well as similar biaxial response, suggesting that physiological remodeling of 
      collagen induced by TE partially counteracts pro-fibrotic XR effects. Skin growth 
      was indirectly assessed with a kinematic approach that quantified increase in 
      permanent area changes without reduction in thickness, suggesting production of 
      new tissue driven by TE even in the presence of radiation treatment. Future work 
      will focus on the detailed biological mechanisms by which TE counteracts 
      radiation induced fibrosis. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Breast cancer is the most 
      prevalent in women and its treatment often results in total breast removal 
      (mastectomy), followed by reconstruction using tissue expanders. Radiation, which 
      is used in about a third of breast reconstruction cases, can lead to significant 
      complications. The timing of radiation treatment remains controversial. Radiation 
      is known to cause immediate skin damage and long-term fibrosis. Tissue expansion 
      leads to a pro-regenerative response involving collagen remodeling. Here we show 
      that tissue expansion immediately prior to radiation can reduce the level of 
      radiation-induced fibrosis. Thus, we anticipate that this new evidence will open 
      up new avenues of investigation into how the collagen remodeling and 
      pro-regenerative effects of tissue expansion can be leverage to prevent 
      radiation-induced fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The difference in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO(2)) between 
      mixed or central venous blood and arterial blood, known as the ...PCO(2) or CO(2) 
      gap, has demonstrated a strong relationship with cardiac index during septic 
      shock resuscitation. Early monitoring of the ...PCO(2) can help assess the cardiac 
      output (CO) adequacy for tissue perfusion. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the value 
      of ...PCO(2) changes in early septic shock management compared with CO. METHODS: 
      This observational prospective study included 76 patients diagnosed with septic 
      shock admitted to Cairo University Hospital's Critical Care Department between 
      December 2020 and March 2022. Patients were categorised by initial resuscitation 
      response, initial ...PCO(2) and 28-day mortality. The primary outcome was the 
      relationship between the ...PCO(2) and CO changes before and after initial 
      resuscitation, with secondary outcomes including ICU length of stay (LOS) and 
      28-day mortality. RESULTS: Peri-resuscitation ...PCO(2) changes predicted a >/=15% 
      change in the cardiac index (CI) (area under the curve (AUC) 0.727; 95% CI 0.614 
      - 0.840) with 66.7% sensitivity and 62.8% specificity. The optimal ...PCO(2) change 
      cut-off value was <-1.85, corresponding to a <-22% threshold for a 15% cardiac 
      index increase. The PCO(2) gap ratio (gap/gap ratio of T(1)- PCO(2) gap to T(0) 
      -PCO(2) gap) also predicted a >/=15% change in cardiac index (AUC 745; 95% CI 0.634 
      - 0.855) with 63.6% sensitivity and 79.1% specificity. The optimal CO(2) gap/gap 
      ratio cut-off value was <0.71. A significant difference in 28-day mortality was 
      noted based on the gap/gap ratio. CONCLUSION: Peri-resuscitation ...PCO(2) and the 
      gap/gap ratio are useful non-invasive bedside markers for predicting changes in 
      CO and preload responsiveness. CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY: The current study 
      provides an insight to the PCO(2) gap changes during and after early 
      resuscitation of septic shock patients, which correlate to cardiac output changes 
      and might also serve as a fluid responsiveness indicator.

TI  - The Association Between Medicaid Expansion and Disparities in Vestibular 
      Schwannoma Incidence.
PG  - 4383-4388
LID - 10.1002/lary.31517 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effect of Medicaid expansion as a part of the Affordable Care Act 
      on vestibular schwannoma (VS) incidence overall and in marginalized populations 
      has not yet been elucidated. The goal of this study was to determine if Medicaid 
      expansion was associated with increases in VS incidence overall, as well as in 
      patients of non-white race or in counties of low socioeconomic status (SES). 
      METHODS: We performed a difference-in-difference (DiD) analysis from January 1st 
      2010-December 31st 2017 utilizing the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 
      (SEER) database. Our DiD method compared the change in VS rate between counties 
      that did and did not expand Medicaid among patients of white and non-white race, 
      in low and high SES counties, before and after expansion. RESULTS: The study 
      included 17,312 cases across 1020 counties. Medicaid expansion was associated 
      with a 15% increase (incidence rate ratio 95% CI: [11%, 19]) in VS incidence. 
      White populations saw a 10% increase (CI: [1.06, 1.19]), Black populations saw a 
      20% increase (CI: [1.10, 1.29]), and patients of other races saw a 44% increase 
      in incidence associated with expansion (CI: [1.21, 1.70]). Low SES counties saw 
      an increase in incidence 1.12 times higher than that of high SES counties 
      (CI:[1.04, 1.20]). CONCLUSION: Medicaid expansion was associated with increases 
      in VS incidence across populations. Furthermore, this increase was more evident 
      in disadvantaged populations, such as patients of non-white race and those from 
      low SES counties. These findings emphasize the impact of Medicaid expansion on 
      healthcare utilization for VS diagnosis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3-Retrospective

TI  - Mini-heterochromatin domains constrain the cis-regulatory impact of SVA

AB  - SVA (SINE (short interspersed nuclear element)-VNTR (variable number of tandem 
      repeats)-Alu) retrotransposons remain active in humans and contribute to 
      individual genetic variation. Polymorphic SVA alleles harbor gene regulatory 
      potential and can cause genetic disease. However, how SVA insertions are 
      controlled and functionally impact human disease is unknown. Here we dissect the 
      epigenetic regulation and influence of SVAs in cellular models of X-linked 
      dystonia parkinsonism (XDP), a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an SVA 
      insertion at the TAF1 locus. We demonstrate that the KRAB zinc finger protein 
      ZNF91 establishes H3K9me3 and DNA methylation over SVAs, including polymorphic 
      alleles, in human neural progenitor cells. The resulting mini-heterochromatin 
      domains attenuate the cis-regulatory impact of SVAs. This is critical for XDP 
      pathology; removal of local heterochromatin severely aggravates the XDP molecular 
      phenotype, resulting in increased TAF1 intron retention and reduced expression. 
      Our results provide unique mechanistic insights into how human polymorphic 
      transposon insertions are recognized and how their regulatory impact is 
      constrained by an innate epigenetic defense system.

TI  - Stability of Mosaic Divergent Repeat Interruptions in X-Linked 
      Dystonia-Parkinsonism.
PG  - 1145-1153
LID - 10.1002/mds.29809 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: X-Linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is an adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder characterized by rapidly progressive dystonia and 
      parkinsonism. Mosaic Divergent Repeat Interruptions affecting motif Length and 
      Sequence (mDRILS) were recently found within the TAF1 SVA repeat tract and were 
      shown to associate with repeat stability and age at onset in XDP, specifically 
      the AGGG [5'-SINE-VNTR-Alu(AGAGGG)(2)AGGG(AGAGGG)(n)] mDRILS. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study aimed to investigate the stability of mDRILS frequencies and stability of 
      (AGAGGG)(n) repeat length during transmission in parent-offspring pairs. METHODS: 
      Fifty-six families (n = 130) were investigated for generational transmission of 
      repeat length and mDRILS. The mDRILS stability of 16 individuals was assessed at 
      two sampling points 1 year apart. DNA was sequenced with long-read technologies 
      after long-range polymerase chain reaction amplification of the TAF1 SVA. Repeat 
      number and mDRILS were detected with Noise-Cancelling Repeat Finder (NCRF). 
      RESULTS: When comparing the repeat domain, 51 of 65 children had either 
      contractions or expansions of the repeat length. The AGGG frequency remained 
      stable across generations at 0.074 (IQR: 0.069-0.078) (z = -0.526; P = 0.599). 
      However, the median AGGG frequency in children with an expansion (0.072 [IQR: 
      0.066-0.076]) was lower compared with children with retention or contraction 
      (0.080 [IQR: 0.073-0.083]) (z = -0.007; P = 0.003). In a logistic regression 
      model, the AGGG frequency predicted the outcome of either expansion or 
      retention/contraction when including repeat number and sex as covariates 
      (beta = 80.7; z-score = 2.63; P = 0.0085). The AGGG frequency varied slightly over 
      1 year (0.070 [IQR: 0.063-0.080] to 0.073 [IQR: 0.069-0.078]). CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results show that a higher AGGG frequency may stabilize repeats across 
      generations. This highlights the importance of further investigating mDRILS as a 
      disease-modifying factor with generational differences. (c) 2024 The Authors.

TI  - Effects of Achieving Rapid, Intensive, and Sustained Blood Pressure Reduction in 
      Intracerebral Hemorrhage Expansion and Functional Outcome.
PG  - e209244
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000209244 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The time taken to achieve blood pressure (BP) control 
      could be pivotal in the benefits of reducing BP in acute intracerebral hemorrhage 
      (ICH). We aimed to assess the relationship between the rapid achievement and 
      sustained maintenance of an intensive systolic BP (SBP) target with radiologic, 
      clinical, and functional outcomes. METHODS: Rapid, Intensive, and Sustained BP 
      lowering in Acute ICH (RAINS) was a multicenter, prospective, observational 
      cohort study of adult patients with ICH <6 hours and SBP >/=150 mm Hg at 4 
      Comprehensive Stroke Centers during a 4.5-year period. Patients underwent 
      baseline and 24-hour CT scans and 24-hour noninvasive BP monitoring. BP was 
      managed under a rapid (target achievement </=60 minutes), intensive (target SBP 
      <140 mm Hg), and sustained (target stability for 24 hours) BP protocol. SBP 
      target achievement </=60 minutes and 24-hour SBP variability were recorded. 
      Outcomes included hematoma expansion (>6 mL or >33%) at 24 hours (primary 
      outcome), early neurologic deterioration (END, 24-hour increase in NIH Stroke 
      Scale score >/=4), and 90-day ordinal modified Rankin scale (mRS) score. Analyses 
      were adjusted by age, sex, anticoagulation, onset-to-imaging time, ICH volume, 
      and intraventricular extension. RESULTS: We included 312 patients (mean age 70.2 
      +/- 13.3 years, 202 [64.7%] male). Hematoma expansion occurred in 70/274 (25.6%) 
      patients, END in 58/291 (19.9%), and the median 90-day mRS score was 4 
      (interquartile range, 2-5). SBP target achievement </=60 minutes (178/312 [57.1%]) 
      associated with a lower risk of hematoma expansion (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 
      0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-0.77), lower END rate (aOR 0.43, 95% CI 
      0.23-0.80), and lower 90-day mRS scores (aOR 0.48, 95% CI 0.32-0.74). The mean 
      24-hour SBP variability was 21.0 +/- 7.6 mm Hg. Higher 24-hour SBP variability was 
      not related to expansion (aOR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95-1.04) but associated with higher 
      END rate (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.09-1.21) and 90-day mRS scores (aOR 1.06, 95% CI 
      1.04-1.10). DISCUSSION: Among patients with acute ICH, achieving an intensive SBP 
      target within 60 minutes was associated with lower hematoma expansion risk. Rapid 
      SBP reduction and stable sustention within 24 hours were related to improved 
      clinical and functional outcomes. These findings warrant the design of randomized 
      clinical trials examining the impact of effectively achieving rapid, intensive, 
      and sustained BP control on hematoma expansion. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This 
      study provides Class III evidence that in adults with spontaneous ICH and initial 
      SBP >/=150 mm Hg, lowering SBP to <140 mm Hg within the first hour and maintaining 
      this for 24 hours is associated with decreased hematoma expansion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is wide variation in the language used to describe Mullerian 
      structures. To standardize terminology, the American Society of Reproductive 
      Medicine (ASRM) created the Mullerian Anomalies Classification (MAC) in 2021. The 
      objective of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the MAC nomenclature 
      to pediatric patients with cloaca. METHODS: A retrospective review of all 
      patients with cloaca was performed at a single institution. Descriptions of 
      Mullerian structures were evaluated and compared to the ASRM MAC categories. 
      Descriptive statistics were used to report findings. RESULTS: 36 patients with 
      cloaca were identified, 13 (36%) of whom had congenital Mullerian structures that 
      could not be adequately described by the MAC terminology. All 13 patients had two 
      hemiuteri that were not connected in the midline and were not accurately 
      described as uterus didelphys. Additionally, 5 of these 13 patients had 
      reproductive anatomy that was connected by a fistula or ectopic connection to 
      other pelvic structures. CONCLUSION: Despite the ASRM expansion of the Mullerian 
      anomalies nomenclature, more than a third of our patients with cloaca could not 
      have their Mullerian structures accurately described. Describing anatomy with 
      accurate and consistent language can improve communication between healthcare 
      providers and may allow patients and families to better anticipate fertility 
      options. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.

TI  - Cervicofacial Pediatric Tissue Expansion: Aesthetic Unit-Based Algorithm.
PG  - 1298-1308
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000011401 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tissue expansion is a powerful tool in reconstruction of pediatric 
      soft-tissue pathologies, but complication rates in children have been reported to 
      be as high as 40%. Infection and implant extrusion lead to premature removal and 
      delays in reconstruction. Expanding the head and neck is uniquely challenging 
      because the confluence of facial aesthetic units must be respected. These 
      challenges prompted the senior author (R.J.R.) to create an aesthetic unit-based 
      algorithm. METHODS: A retrospective study of pediatric patients who underwent 
      cervicofacial tissue expander placement over a 17-year period was performed by 
      the senior author. Predictor variables included age, sex, race, indication, 
      number of expanders placed at each operation, serial expansion, expander type, 
      expander size, home versus clinic inflation, and prophylactic antibiotics. 
      Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for 
      complications. RESULTS: An aesthetic unit-based reconstructive algorithm is 
      proposed. Forty-eight pediatric patients had 111 cervicofacial tissue expanders 
      placed. Twenty expanders were associated with complications (18%) for surgical 
      site infection (12.6%), extrusion (4.5%), or expander deflation (6.3%). Expanders 
      placed for congenital nevi ( P = 0.042) and use of textured expanders ( P = 
      0.027) were significantly associated with decreased complication levels. When 
      controlling for covariates, serial expansion of the same site was associated with 
      increased rate of readmission ( P = 0.027) after having just 1 previous expander. 
      Iatrogenic ectropion occurred in 13.5% of the study population; expanders with at 
      least 1 complication during tissue expansion were significantly associated with 
      incidence of iatrogenic ectropion ( P = 0.026). CONCLUSION: By using an aesthetic 
      unit-based algorithm, reconstructive outcomes can be optimized for pediatric 
      cervicofacial tissue expansion. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic,

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish and characterize a diverse library of head and neck 
      squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) cultures using conditional reprogramming (CR). 
      METHODS: Patients enrolled on an IRB-approved protocol to generate tumor cell 
      cultures using CR methods. Tumor and blood samples were collected and clinical 
      information was recorded. Successful CR cultures were validated against banked 
      reference tumors with short tandem repeat genotyping. Cell morphology was 
      archived with photodocumentation. Clinical and demographic factors were evaluated 
      for associations with successful establishment of CR culture. Human papilloma 
      virus (HPV) genotyping, clonogenic survival, MTT assays, spheroid growth, and 
      whole exome sequencing were carried out in selected cultures. RESULTS: Forty four 
      patients were enrolled, with 31 (70%) successful CR cultures, 32% derived from 
      patients who identified as Black and 61% as Hispanic. All major head and neck 
      disease sites were represented, including 15 (48%) oral cavity and 8 (26%) 
      p16-positive oropharynx cancers. Hispanic ethnicity and first primary tumors (vs. 
      second primary or recurrent tumors) were significantly associated with successful 
      CR culture. HPV expression was conserved in CR cultures, including CR-024, which 
      carried a novel HPV-69 serotype. CR cultures were used to test cisplatin 
      responses using MTT assays. Previous work has also demonstrated these models can 
      be used to assess response to radiation and can be engrafted in mouse models. 
      Whole exome sequencing demonstrated that CR cultures preserved tumor mutation 
      burden and driver mutations. CONCLUSION: CR culture is highly successful in 
      propagating HNSCC cells. This study included a high proportion of patients from 
      underrepresented minority groups. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Not Applicable Laryngoscope,

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To verify changes in facial soft tissue using the RadiANT-DICOM-viewer 
      and Dolphin Imaging software, through linear measurements of tomographic points 
      in a 3D reconstruction of the face and volumetric evaluation with 
      three-dimensional measurements of the upper airways of patients with transverse 
      maxillary discrepancy undergoing Surgically Assisted Rapid Maxillary Expansion 
      (SARME). METHODS: Retrospective, transverse, and descriptive study, through the 
      analysis of computed tomography scans of the face of patients with transverse 
      maxillary discrepancy, treated from July 2019 to December 2022. The sample 
      consisted of 15 patients of both sexes, aged 21-42 years old, who underwent 
      surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion using the transpalatal distractor. 
      Analysis was performed through linear, angular, and three-dimensional 
      measurements in millimeters, in the preoperative and late four-month 
      postoperative period, in frontal 3D tomographic images of the face, in the region 
      of the width of the nose and alar base and also angular measurement in the 
      lateral tomography for the angle nasolabial and upper airways of rhinopharynx, 
      oropharynx and hypopharynx. RESULTS: There was an increase in nasal width with an 
      average of 1.3467mm and an increase in the alar base with an average of 1.7333mm. 
      A significant difference was found in the pre- and postoperative assessments of 
      the measurements of nasal width, alar base and nasolabial angle, as well as the 
      upper airways in all their extension. The results favour a better understanding 
      of the professional and the patient regarding the diagnosis and management of 
      patients with transverse maxillary width discrepancies. CONCLUSION: Although our 
      study shows an increase in soft tissues after SARME, no aesthetic changes are 
      observed clinically, and all patients report significant respiratory improvement. 
      SARME may therefore contribute to the improvement of professionals working in the 
      field of oral and maxillofacial surgery and orthodontics. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:

TI  - Addressing Veteran Health-Related Social Needs: How Joint Commission Standards 
      Accelerated Integration and Expansion of Tools and Services in the Veterans 
      Health Administration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Joint Commission recently named reduction of health care 
      disparities and improvement of health care equity as quality and safety 
      priorities (Leadership [LD] Standard LD.04.03.08 and National Patient Safety Goal 
      [NPSG] Standard NPSG.16.01.01). As the largest integrated health system, the 
      Veterans Health Administration (VHA) sought to leverage these new accreditation 
      standards to further integrate and expand existing tools and initiatives to 
      reduce health care disparities and address health-related social needs (HRSNs). 
      INITIATIVES AND TOOLS: A combination of existing data tools (for example, Primary 
      Care Equity Dashboard), resource tools (for example, Assessing Circumstances and 
      Offering Resources for Needs tool), and a care delivery approach (for example, 
      Whole Health) are discussed as quality improvement opportunities to further 
      integrate and expand how VHA addresses health care disparities and HRSNs. The 
      authors detail the development timeline, building, limitations, and future plans 
      for these tools and initiatives. COORDINATION OF INITIATIVES: Responding to new 
      health care equity Joint Commission standards led to new implementation 
      strategies and deeper partnerships across VHA that facilitated expanded 
      dissemination, technical assistance activities, and additional resources for VHA 
      facilities to meet new standards and improve health care equity for veterans. 
      Health care systems may learn from VHA's experiences, which include building 
      actionable data platforms, employing user-centered design for initiative 
      development and iteration, designing wide-reaching dissemination strategies for 
      tools, and recognizing the importance of providing technical assistance for 
      stakeholders. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: VHA continues to expand implementation of a 
      diverse set of tools and resources to reduce health care disparities and identify 
      and address unmet individual veteran HRSNs more widely and effectively.

TI  - Posterior Palatal Expansion via Subnasal Endoscopy (2PENN) for Maxillary 
      Deficiency: A Pilot Study.
PG  - 1970-1977
LID - 10.1002/lary.31060 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion (SARPE) addresses 
      transverse maxillary deficiency, a known contributor to nasal obstruction. The 
      purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility, preliminary outcomes, and 
      safety of posterior palatal expansion via subnasal endoscopy (2PENN), a modified 
      SARPE procedure, aimed at achieving anterior and posterior maxillary expansion. 
      METHODS: This prospective case series included consecutive adult patients with 
      findings of transverse maxillary deficiency that underwent the 2PENN procedure 
      from 4/2021 to 4/2022. Patients completed pre- and post-operative clinical 
      evaluations, Nasal Obstruction and Septoplasty Effectiveness (NOSE) 
      questionnaires, and computed tomography (CT), with measures including expansion 
      at the level of the posterior nasal spine (PNS), first maxillary inter-molar 
      distance (IMD), and anterior nasal spine (ANS). RESULTS: The cohort (N = 20) was 
      middle-aged (39 +/- 11 years), predominantly male (80%), and overweight (BMI 
      28 +/- 4 kg/m(2) ). The majority (85%) of patients had sleep breathing issues, of 
      which 10 (59%) had polysomnography-confirmed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Full 
      anterior-posterior separation of the mid-palatal suture line was evident on all 
      post-operative CT scans, with mean expansion at the PNS of 3.6 +/- 1.3 mm, IMD of 
      6.1 +/- 1.6 mm and ANS of 7.0 +/- 1.6 mm (p < 0.001). Following surgery, mean NOSE 
      scores improved from 57 +/- 23 to 14 +/- 13 (p < 0.001). One patient required 
      maxillary antrostomy for post-operative sinusitis. CONCLUSION: 2PENN is an 
      effective and safe technique for achieving both anterior and posterior maxillary 
      expansion in patients with transverse maxillary deficiency. Further study is 
      warranted to better understand the effect of 2PENN in patients with OSA, 
      particularly as it relates to improving pharyngeal patency. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4

AB  - De novo designed peptides that self-assemble into cross-beta rich fibrillar 
      biomaterials have been pursued as an innovative platform for the development of 
      adjuvant- and inflammation-free vaccines. However, they share structural and 
      morphological properties similar to amyloid species implicated in 
      neurodegenerative diseases, which has been a long-standing concern for their 
      successful translation. Here, we comprehensively characterize the amyloidogenic 
      character of the amphipathic self-assembling cross-beta peptide KFE(8), compared to 
      pathological amyloid and amyloid-like proteins alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) and TDP-43. 
      Further, we developed plasmid-based DNA vaccines with the KFE(8) backbone serving 
      as a scaffold for delivery of a GFP model antigen. We find that expression of 
      tandem repeats of KFE(8) is non-toxic and efficiently cleared by autophagy. We 
      also demonstrate that preformed KFE(8) fibrils do not cross-seed amyloid 
      formation of alpha-syn in mammalian cells compared to alpha-syn preformed fibrils. In 
      mice, vaccination with plasmids encoding the KFE(32)-GFP fusion protein elicited 
      robust immune responses, inducing production of significantly higher levels of 
      anti-GFP antibodies compared to soluble GFP. Antigen-specific CD8(+)T cells were 
      also detected in the spleens of vaccinated mice and cytokine profiles from 
      antigen recall assays indicate a balanced Th1/Th2 response. These findings 
      illustrate that cross-beta-rich peptide nanofibers have distinct physicochemical 
      properties from those of pathological amyloidogenic proteins, and are an 
      attractive platform for the development of DNA vaccines with self-adjuvanting 
      properties and improved safety profiles. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Biomaterials 
      comprised of self-assembling peptides hold great promise for the development of 
      new vaccines that do not require use of adjuvants. However, these materials have 
      safety concerns, as they self-assemble into cross-beta rich fibrils that are 
      structurally similar to amyloid species implicated in disease. Here, we 
      comprehensively study the properties of these biomaterials. We demonstrate that 
      they have distinct properties from pathological proteins. They are non-toxic and 
      do not trigger amyloidogenesis. Vaccination of these materials in mice elicited a 
      robust immune response. Most excitingly, our work suggests that this platform 
      could be used to develop DNA-based vaccines, which have few storage requirements. 
      Further, due to their genetic encoding, longer sequences can be generated and the 
      vaccines will be amenable to modification.

TI  - Cochlear Nucleus Transcriptome of a Fragile X Mouse Model Reveals Candidate Genes 
      for Hyperacusis.
PG  - 1363-1371
LID - 10.1002/lary.30936 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a hereditary form of autism spectrum 
      disorder. It is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the Fmr1 gene, 
      leading to a loss of Fragile X Protein (FMRP) expression. The loss of FMRP causes 
      auditory hypersensitivity: FXS patients display hyperacusis and the Fmr1- 
      knock-out (KO) mouse model for FXS exhibits auditory seizures. FMRP is strongly 
      expressed in the cochlear nucleus and other auditory brainstem nuclei. We 
      hypothesize that the Fmr1-KO mouse has altered gene expression in the cochlear 
      nucleus that may contribute to auditory hypersensitivity. METHODS: RNA was 
      isolated from cochlear nuclei of Fmr1-KO and WT mice. Using next-generation 
      sequencing (RNA-seq), the transcriptomes of Fmr1-KO mice and WT mice (n = 3 each) 
      were compared and analyzed using gene ontology programs. RESULTS: We identified 
      270 unique, differentially expressed genes between Fmr1-KO and WT cochlear 
      nuclei. Upregulated genes (67%) are enriched in those encoding secreted 
      molecules. Downregulated genes (33%) are enriched in neuronal function, including 
      synaptic pathways, some of which are ideal candidate genes that may contribute to 
      hyperacusis. CONCLUSION: The loss of FMRP can affect the expression of genes in 
      the cochlear nucleus that are important for neuronal signaling. One of these, 
      Kcnab2, which encodes a subunit of the Shaker voltage-gated potassium channel, is 
      expressed at an abnormally low level in the Fmr1-KO cochlear nucleus. Kcnab2 and 
      other differentially expressed genes may represent pathways for the development 
      of hyperacusis. Future studies will be aimed at investigating the effects of 
      these altered genes on hyperacusis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A Laryngoscope,

TI  - Risk Factors for Unplanned Reoperation during the Expansion Phase in Two-Stage 
      Breast Reconstruction in the Dutch Breast Implant Registry.
PG  - 33e-43e
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000010945 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of postmastectomy breast reconstructions (PMBRs) are 
      currently performed in two stages using a tissue expander (TE). However, 
      complications during the expansion phase occur regularly, leading to unplanned 
      reoperations and/or reconstruction failure. This study aimed to identify risk 
      factors for unplanned reoperation after TE placement, assessed the time until 
      unplanned and planned reoperation, and investigated indications for unplanned 
      reoperation. METHODS: Patient- and surgery-related characteristics of patients 
      who underwent two-stage PMBR between 2017 and 2021 were collected from the Dutch 
      Breast Implant Registry (DBIR). Unplanned reoperation was defined as TE 
      explantation followed by either no replacement or replacement with the same or a 
      different TE. Covariate-adjusted characteristics associated with unplanned 
      reoperation were determined using backward stepwise selection and multivariable 
      logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: In total, 2529 patients (mean age, 50.2 
      years) were included. Unplanned reoperation occurred in 19.4% of all registered 
      TEs ( n = 3190). Independent factors associated with unplanned reoperation were 
      body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 25 kg/m 2 (adjusted OR [aOR], 
      1.63, 99% CI, 1.20 to 2.57 for BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m 2 ; aOR, 2.57, 99% CI, 1.74 
      to 3.78 for BMI >/=30 kg/m 2 ), low institutional volume (aOR, 1.51; 99% CI, 1.06 
      to 2.18), no drains (aOR, 2.06; 99% CI, 1.15 to 3.60), subcutaneous TE placement 
      (aOR, 5.71; 99% CI, 3.59 to 9.10), and partial pectoralis major muscle coverage 
      (aOR, 1.35; 99% CI, 1.02 to 1.79). Age younger than 40 years (aOR, 0.49; 99% CI, 
      0.32 to 0.74) and delayed PMBR (aOR, 0.35; 99% CI, 0.19 to 0.60) reduced the risk 
      of unplanned reoperation. Median time until reoperation was 97 days for unplanned 
      and 213 days for planned reoperation. Deep wound infections were most often 
      registered as indication for unplanned reoperation (34.4%). CONCLUSION: This 
      study identified several risk factors for unplanned reoperation that may be used 
      to reduce complications in expander-based PMBR. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: Risk, III.

TI  - Lesion Expansion in Gnathic Fibrous Dysplasia: Natural History, Indicators of 
      Progression, and Response to Bisphosphonates.
PG  - 1465-1471
LID - 10.1002/jbmr.4886 [doi]
AB  - Fibrous dysplasia (FD) is characterized by expansile fibro-osseous lesions that 
      may occur in association with endocrinopathies as part of McCune-Albright 
      syndrome (MAS). Craniofacial FD is a significant source of morbidity and most 
      commonly involves the gnathic bones. There is a critical need to understand the 
      natural history and risk factors for gnathic FD progression to develop 
      preventative trials and identify candidates for intervention. The purpose of this 
      study was to characterize gnathic FD lesion expansion and to identify risk 
      factors associated with lesion growth. Patients with gnathic FD and serial CT 
      imaging were evaluated. Volumetric analyses of CT scans were performed using MIM 
      Encore software. Generalized mixed model analysis was used to account for 
      intra-subject correlation, with FD lesion volume as the dependent variable. In 
      addition to age, effects of MAS-associated endocrinopathies, sex, disease 
      severity, and bisphosphonate treatment were evaluated. A total of 104 total 
      lesions in 52 patients were characterized longitudinally. Median age at initial 
      scan was 8.8 years (range 3.4-18.8), and median age at final scan was 16.8 years 
      (range 6.9-33.4 years). The median number of scans per subject was 4 (range 
      2-14). FD lesion volume increased with age (2.50 cm(3) /yr, 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 1.95-3.04, p < 0.001). However, lesion expansion rate decreased 
      over time (-0.05 cm(3) /yr, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.04, p < 0.001). Mandibular lesions 
      tended to expand at a greater rate than maxillary lesions (p < 0.001). Growth 
      hormone excess was associated with accelerated expansion rate (p = 0.002). Other 
      MAS-associated endocrinopathies, pubertal status, sex, weight, lesion density, 
      disease severity, and bisphosphonate treatment were not associated with lesion 
      volume or expansion. Gnathic FD lesion expansion is most rapid in younger 
      children and declines as patients approach adulthood. The availability of 
      quantitative natural history data will guide clinicians in identifying patients 
      who are candidates for medical and surgical interventions and clinical trials for 
      preventative therapies. Published 2023. This article is a U.S. Government work

TI  - Frequency and Phenotype of RFC1 Repeat Expansions in Bilateral Vestibulopathy.
PG  - e1001-e1013
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000207553 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bilateral vestibulopathy (BVP) is a chronic 
      debilitating neurologic disorder with no monogenic cause established so far 
      despite familiar presentations. We hypothesized that replication factor complex 
      subunit 1 (RFC1) repeat expansions might present a recurrent monogenic cause of 
      BVP. METHODS: The study involved RFC1 screening and in-depth neurologic, 
      vestibulo-oculomotor, and disease evolution phenotyping of 168 consecutive 
      patients with idiopathic at least "probable BVP" from a tertiary referral center 
      for balance disorders, with127 of them meeting current diagnostic criteria of BVP 
      (Barany Society Classification). RESULTS: Biallelic AAGGG repeat expansions in 
      RFC1 were identified in 10/127 patients (8%) with BVP and 1/41 with probable BVP. 
      Heterozygous expansions in 10/127 patients were enriched compared with those in 
      reference populations. RFC1-related BVP manifested at a median age of 60 years 
      (range 34-72 years) and co-occurred predominantly with mild polyneuropathy 
      (10/11). Additional cerebellar involvement (7/11) was subtle and limited to 
      oculomotor signs in early stages, below recognition of classic cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome. Clear dysarthria, appendicular 
      ataxia, or cerebellar atrophy developed 6-8 years after onset. Dysarthria, absent 
      patellar reflexes, and downbeat nystagmus best discriminated RFC1-positive BVP 
      from RFC1-negative BVP, but neither sensory symptoms nor fine motor problems. 
      Video head impulse gains of patients with RFC1-positive BVP were lower relative 
      to those of patients with RFC1-negative BVP and decreased until 10 years disease 
      duration, indicating a potential progression and outcome marker for RFC1-disease. 
      DISCUSSION: This study identifies RFC1 as the first-and frequent-monogenic cause 
      of BVP. It characterizes RFC1-related BVP as part of the multisystemic evolution 
      of RFC1 spectrum disease, with implications for designing natural history studies 
      and future treatment trials. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides 
      Class II evidence that RFC1 repeat expansions cause BVP.

PG  - 23-30
LID - 10.15605/jafes.037.S6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: X-linked Dystonia Parkinsonism (XDP) is associated with a SINE-VNTR- 
      Alu (SVA) retrotransposon insertion in an intron of the TAF1 gene that alters 
      gene transcription and splicing. In this study, we determined if the SVA 
      insertion introduces glucocorticoid (GC)-responsive cis-regulatory elements that 
      may contribute to dysregulated TAF1 transcription and XDP disease progression. 
      METHODOLOGY: We performed in silico analysis to identify potential GC receptor 
      (GR) binding sites within the XDP-SVA. We also conducted promoter-reporter assays 
      on HeLa and HEK293T cells to assess the intrinsic promoter activity of three 
      XDP-SVA variants representing different hexameric repeat lengths associated with 
      differences in disease onset. We treated XDP fibroblast cell models with GR 
      agonist (CORT) or antagonist (RU486), then subjected TAF1 and the XDP-associated 
      aberrant transcript, TAF1-32i to gene expression analysis. RESULTS: A 
      transcription factor binding site search revealed three binding sites for GR 
      within the XDP-SVA-two within the SINE region and one in the Alu region. 
      Promoter-reporter assays showed induction of XDP-SVA promoter activity upon CORT 
      treatment that was dependent on the cell line and XDP-SVA hexamer repeat length. 
      Gene expression analysis showed that baseline TAF1 levels differed between 
      control and patient fibroblast cell lines, and treatment with CORT led to an 
      increasing trend in the expression of the aberrant TAF1-32i transcript but did 
      not reach statistical significance. Treatment with RU486 increased TAF1 mRNA 
      expression only in the control cell lines. CONCLUSION: Using reporter assays, the 
      XDP-SVA was shown to exhibit CORT-dependent transcriptional activation. Gene 
      expression analysis also showed that GC signaling may influence TAF1 and TAF1-32i 
      expression, possibly through interaction with the XDP-SVA. Our data provide a 
      potential link between stress and XDP progression.

TI  - Comparison of Morphometric Outcomes following Open Posterior Expansion versus 
      Endoscopic Strip Craniectomy for Sagittal Synostosis.
PG  - 1095-1106
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000010679 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Open middle and posterior cranial vault expansion (OPVE) or 
      endoscopic (ES) strip craniectomy are two surgical techniques for normalization 
      of head shape in isolated sagittal synostosis. This study aims to compare 2-year 
      cranial morphometrics after these two approaches. METHODS: The authors performed 
      morphometric analysis on preoperative [time (T) 0], immediately postoperative 
      (T1), and 2-year (T2) postoperative computed tomographic scans of patients who 
      underwent OPVE or ES before 4 months of age. Perioperative data and morphometrics 
      were compared between the two groups and age-matched controls. RESULTS: Nineteen 
      patients were included in the ES cohort, 19 age-matched patients were included in 
      the OPVE cohort, and 57 were included as controls. Median surgery time and blood 
      transfusion volume were less for the ES approach (118 minutes and 0 cc, 
      respectively) compared with OPVE (204 minutes and 250 cc, respectively). 
      Anthropometric measurements after OPVE were closer in normal controls at T1 
      compared with ES, but the skull shapes were comparable at T2. In the midsagittal 
      plane, anterior vault was higher after OPVE at T2 compared with both ES and 
      controls, but the posterior length was shorter and closer to controls than in the 
      ES cohort. Cranial volumes were like controls for both cohorts at T2. There was 
      no difference in complication rate. CONCLUSIONS: Both OPVE and ES techniques 
      result in normalization of cranial shape in patients with isolated sagittal 
      synostosis after 2 years with minimal morphometric differences. Family 
      decision-making between the two approaches should be based on age at 
      presentation, avoidance of blood transfusion, scar pattern, and availability of 
      helmet molding and not on expected outcome. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 
      Therapeutic, III.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Medicaid expansion became 
      effective in states that have adopted it. We aim to examine its impact on head 
      and neck cancers. METHODS: A retrospective study that utilizes the Surveillance, 
      Epidemiology, and End Results database, 2010-2016. Study population included 
      patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), differentiated 
      thyroid carcinoma, and head and neck cutaneous melanoma. The objective is to 
      examine disease-specific survival before and after Medicaid expansion. RESULTS: 
      In states that adopted Medicaid expansion, the ratio of Medicaid: uninsured 
      patients increased from 3:1 to 9:1 (p < 0.001). In states that did not adopt 
      Medicaid expansion, the ratio increased from 1:1 to 2:1 (p < 0.001), making the 
      increase in Medicaid coverage in states that adopted the expansion significantly 
      higher (p < 0.001). Patients diagnosed with HNSCC before the expansion had worse 
      survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.24, 95% confidence interval: 1.11, 1.39, 
      p < 0.001) in states that adopted Medicaid expansion. CONCLUSIONS: Early data 
      indicate that implementation of ACA improved disease-specific survival of 
      patients with HNSCC. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 Laryngoscope, 133:1409-1414, 2023.

TI  - History repeats itself: Impact of mental illness on violent reinjury and hospital 
      reencounters among female victims of interpersonal violence.
PG  - 143-150
LID - 10.1097/TA.0000000000003984 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Violence-related reinjury impacts both patients and health care 
      systems. Mental illness (MI) is prevalent among violently injured individuals. 
      The relationship between preexisting MI and violent reinjury among women has not 
      been fully characterized. Our objective was to determine if risk of hospital 
      reencounter-violent reinjury and all-cause-was associated with preexisting MI at 
      time of index injury among female victims of violence. METHODS: All females 
      (15-100 + years) presenting to a level I trauma center with violent injury 
      (2002-2019) surviving to discharge were included (N = 1,056). Exposure was 
      presence of preexisting MI. The primary outcome was hospital reencounters for 
      violent reinjury and all-cause within one year (through 2020). The secondary 
      outcome was the development of a new MI within one year of index injury. Odds of 
      reencounter and development of new MI for those with and without preexisting MI 
      were compared with multivariable logistic regression, stratified for interaction 
      when appropriate. RESULTS: There were 404 women (38%) with preexisting MI at time 
      of index injury. Approximately 11% of patients with preexisting MI experienced 
      violent reinjury compared to 5% of those without within 1 year ( p < 0.001). 
      Specifically, those with MI in the absence of concomitant substance use had more 
      than three times the odds of violent reinjury (adjusted Odds Ratio, 3.52 (1.57, 
      7.93); p = 0.002). Of those with preexisting MI, 64% had at least one reencounter 
      for any reason compared to 46% of those without ( p < 0.001 ) . Odds of all-cause 
      reencounter for those with preexisting MI were nearly twice of those without 
      (adjusted Odds Ratio, 1.81 [1.36, 2.42]; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Among female 
      victims of violence, preexisting MI is associated with a significantly increased 
      risk of hospital reencounter and violent reinjury within the first year after 
      index injury. Recognition of this vulnerable population and improved efforts at 
      addressing MI in trauma patients is critical to ongoing prevention efforts to 
      reduce violent reinjury. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic and Epidemiological; Level 
      IV.

TI  - Air versus Saline in Initial Prepectoral Tissue Expansion: A Comparison of 
      Complications and Perioperative Patient-Reported Outcomes.
PG  - 25S-34S
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000010478 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One option to optimize prepectoral tissue expander fill volume while 
      minimizing stress on mastectomy skin flaps is to use air as an initial fill 
      medium, with subsequent exchange to saline during postoperative expansion. The 
      authors compared complications and early patient-reported outcomes (PROs) based 
      on fill type in prepectoral breast reconstruction patients. METHODS: Prepectoral 
      breast reconstruction patients who underwent intraoperative tissue expansion with 
      air or saline from 2018 to 2020 were reviewed to assess fill-type utilization. 
      The primary endpoint was expander loss; secondary endpoints included seroma, 
      hematoma, infection/cellulitis, full-thickness mastectomy skin flap necrosis 
      requiring revision, expander exposure, and capsular contracture. PROs were 
      assessed with the BREAST-Q Physical Well-Being of the Chest scale 2 weeks 
      postoperatively. Propensity-matching was performed as a secondary analysis. 
      RESULTS: Of 560 patients (928 expanders) included in the analysis, 372 had 
      devices initially filled with air (623 expanders), and 188 with saline (305 
      expanders). No differences were observed for overall rates of expander loss (4.7% 
      versus 3.0%, P = 0.290) or overall complications (22.5% versus 17.7%, P = 0.103). 
      No difference in BREAST-Q scores was observed ( P = 0.142). Utilization of 
      air-filled expanders decreased substantially over the last study year. After 
      propensity matching, no differences in loss, other complications, or PROs were 
      observed across cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue expanders initially filled with air 
      seem to have no significant advantage over saline-filled expanders in maintaining 
      mastectomy skin flap viability or PROs, including after propensity matching. 
      These findings can help guide choice of initial tissue expander fill type.

TI  - Comparison of CPAP and Expansion Sphincter Pharyngoplasty using the Mean Disease 
      Alleviation Concept.
PG  - 1513-1517
LID - 10.1002/lary.30613 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the typical first 
      treatment for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA); however, patient adherence is often 
      suboptimal. Expansion Sphincter Pharyngoplasty (ESP) is an alternative treatment 
      option for patients with OSA who demonstrate signs of palatal and lateral 
      pharyngeal collapse. The aim of this study is to compare therapeutic outcomes, 
      using the mean disease alleviation concept, for patients who underwent ESP to 
      patients undergoing CPAP therapy. DATA SOURCES: Single-institution retrospective 
      cohort study. METHODS: All patients who underwent ESP from 2018 to 2021 or were 
      prescribed CPAP from December to June 2021 at our institution were assessed for 
      inclusion. ESP patients who had pre- and post-operative sleep studies available 
      and CPAP patients who followed up at our institution's sleep clinic were included 
      for analysis. Charts were reviewed for demographic information and sleep study 
      results, and treatment outcomes were measured by calculating mean disease 
      alleviation. RESULTS: There were 77 patients in the ESP group and 107 patients in 
      the CPAP group. AHI reduction was greater in the CPAP group (p = 0.016); however, 
      mean disease alleviation was similar between groups (p = 0.076). One-way ANCOVA 
      demonstrated similar MDA between groups when controlling for patient age, BMI, 
      gender, and pre-operative AHI (F [1,177] = 2,931.6, p = 0.104). CONCLUSION: CPAP 
      therapy provided superior reduction in AHI compared to ESP; however, overall 
      treatment efficacy as measured by mean disease alleviation was similar for both 
      groups. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 Laryngoscope, 133:1513-1517, 2023.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation remains the most effective therapy 
      for hematologic and lymphoid disorders. However, as the primary therapeutic 
      cells, the source of HSCs has been limited due to the scarcity of matched donors 
      and difficulties in ex vivo expansion. Here, we described a facile method to 
      attempt the expansion of HSCs in vitro through a porous alginate hydrogel-based 
      3D culture system. We used gelatin powders as the porogen to create 
      submillimeter-scaled pores in alginate gel bulk while pre-embedding naive HSCs in 
      the gel phase. The results indicated that this porous hydrogel system performed 
      significantly better than those cultured via conventional suspension or 
      encapsulation in non-porous alginate hydrogels in maintaining the phenotype and 
      renewability of HSCs. Only the porous hydrogel system achieved a two-fold growth 
      of CD34+ cells within seven days of culture, while the number of CD34+ cells in 
      the suspension system and nonporous hydrogel showed different degrees of 
      attenuation. The expansion efficiency of the porous hydrogel for CD34+CD38- cells 
      was more than 2.2 times that of the other two systems. Mechanistic study via 
      biophysical analysis revealed that the porous alginate system was competent to 
      reduce the electron capture caused by biomaterials, decrease cellular oxygen 
      stress, avoid oxidative protection, thus maintaining the cellular phenotype of 
      the CD34+ cells. The transcriptomic analysis further suggested that the porous 
      alginate system also upregulated the TNF signaling pathway and activated the 
      NF-kappaB signaling pathway to promote the CD34+ cells' survival and maintain 
      cellular homeostasis so that renewability was substantially favoured. STATEMENT 
      OF SIGNIFICANCE: * The reported porous hydrogel system performs significantly 
      better in terms of maintaining the phenotype and renewability of HSCs than those 
      cultured via conventional suspension or encapsulation in non-porous alginate 
      hydrogel. * The reported porous alginate system is competent to reduce the 
      electron capture caused by biomaterials, decrease cellular oxygen stress, avoid 
      oxidative protection, and therefore maintain the cellular phenotype of the CD34+ 
      cells. * The reported porous alginate system can also upregulate the TNF 
      signaling pathway and activate the NF-kappaB signaling pathway to promote the CD34+ 
      cells' survival and maintain cellular homeostasis so that the renewability is 
      substantially favored..

TI  - Two-Center Review of Posterior Vault Expansion following a Staged or Expectant 
      Treatment of Crouzon and Apert Craniosynostosis.
PG  - 615-626
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000009925 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The timing of posterior cranial expansion for the management of 
      intracranial pressure can be "staged" by age and dysmorphology or "expectant" by 
      pressure monitoring. The authors report shared outcome measures from one center 
      performing posterior vault remodeling (PCVR) or distraction (PVDO) following a 
      staged approach and another performing spring-assisted expansion (SAPVE) 
      following an expectant protocol. METHODS: Apert or Crouzon syndrome patients who 
      underwent posterior expansion younger than 2 years were included. Perioperative 
      outcomes and subsequent cranial operations were recorded up to last follow-up and 
      intracranial volume changes measured and adjusted using growth curves. RESULTS: 
      Thirty-eight patients were included. Following the expectant protocol, Apert 
      patients underwent SAPVE at a younger age (8 months) than Crouzon patients (16 
      months). The initial surgery time was shorter but total operative time, including 
      device removal, was longer for PVDO (3 hours 52 minutes) and SAPVE (4 hours 34 
      minutes) than for PCVR (3 hours 24 minutes). Growth-adjusted volume increase was 
      significant and comparable. Fourteen percent of PCVR, 33% of PVDO, and 11% of 
      SAPVE cases had complications, but without long-term deficits. Following the 
      staged approach, 5% underwent only PVDO, 85% had a staged posterior followed by 
      anterior surgery, and 10% required a third expansion. Following the expectant 
      approach, 42% of patients had only posterior expansion at last follow-up, 32% had 
      a secondary cranial surgery, and 26% had a third cranial expansion. CONCLUSION: 
      Two approaches involving posterior vault expansion in young syndromic patients 
      using three techniques resulted in comparable early volume expansion and 
      complication profiles. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III.

TI  - The Treatment of Complex Extremity Wounds Using External Tissue Expansion: A Case 
      Series.
PG  - 673e-678e
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000010015 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: The goal of wound reconstruction is the approximation of soft tissue and 
      re-establishment of an acceptable appearance with minimal risk of complications. 
      For large wound closure in the extremities, skin graft and flap reconstruction 
      are common treatments but are associated with a variety of complications. 
      Comparatively, tissue expansion can provide the opportunity to reconstruct large 
      wounds with native, durable, and sensate tissue without significant donor site 
      morbidity. External tissue expansion is less invasive and avoids complications 
      associated with internal expansion. The authors treated 11 patients with varying 
      extremity wound types and sizes with an external tissue expansion device. Patient 
      age ranged from 18 to 68 years with an average age of 43.7 years (SD, +/- 13.1 
      years). Average wound surface area was approximately 235 cm 2 (SD, +/- 135.3 cm 2 
      ). Devices were affixed and left for 7 to 11 days before closure of the wounds. 
      Outcomes were assessed at 2 to 36 weeks postoperative follow-up. All wounds were 
      fully closed after treatment without need for secondary reconstructive 
      procedures. No patient experienced major complications. All patients demonstrated 
      intact sensation within the area of reconstruction equivalent to surrounding 
      tissues. External tissue expansion, an excellent treatment option in extremity 
      reconstruction, is efficacious and associated with lower complication rates 
      compared with internal tissue expansion, skin grafts, and flap reconstruction. 
      CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.

TI  - Morphometric Outcomes of Nonsyndromic Sagittal Synostosis following Open Middle 
      and Posterior Cranial Vault Expansion.
PG  - 844-854
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000010008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to quantify the change in three-dimensional skull 
      morphometrics for patients with sagittal synostosis at presentation, after 
      surgery, and at 2-year follow-up. METHODS: Computed tomography scans from 91 
      patients with isolated SS were age-, sex-, and race-matched with those from 273 
      controls. The authors performed vector analysis with linear regressions to model 
      the effect of open middle and posterior cranial vault remodeling on cranial shape 
      and growth. RESULTS: Anterior cranial volume, bossing angle, and frontal shape 
      were not changed by surgery but normalized without surgical intervention by 2 
      years. Biparietal narrowing and middle cranial volume were corrected after 
      surgery and maintained at 2 years. Occipital protuberance was improved after 
      surgery and normalized at 2 years. Posterior cranial volume was decreased by 
      occipital remodeling and remained slightly lower than control volumes at 2 years, 
      whereas middle vault volume was larger than in controls. Residual deformities 
      that persisted at 2 years were decreased superolateral width at the level of 
      opisthion and increased anterosuperior height (vertex bulge). Linear models 
      suggested older age at surgery resulted in more scaphocephaly and enlarged 
      posterior cranial vault volumes at 2 years but did not affect other volume 
      outcomes. Preoperative severity was the variable most predictive of 2-year 
      morphometrics. CONCLUSIONS: Initial severity of sagittal synostosis deformity was 
      the best predictor of 2-year morphometric outcomes. Upper posterior cranial width 
      decreases with time after surgery and an anterior vertex bulge can persist after 
      open surgery, but frontal dysmorphology self-corrects without surgical 
      intervention. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.

TI  - Autologous Concentrated Growth Factor Increases Skin Thickness and Area during 
      Tissue Expansion: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 281e-292e
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000010227 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mechanical stretching of the skin (ie, tissue expansion) could 
      generate additional skin, but it is limited by the intrinsic growth capacity. The 
      authors conducted a study of autologous concentrated growth factor (CGF) to 
      promote skin regeneration by increasing skin thickness and area during tissue 
      expansion. METHODS: A single-center randomized controlled trial was conducted 
      from 2016 to 2019. Participants undergoing skin expansion received either CGF or 
      saline by means of intradermal injection on the expanded skin (0.02 mL/cm 2 ), 
      for a total of three treatments at 4-week intervals. The primary endpoint was the 
      expanded skin thickness at 12 weeks, which was measured by ultrasound. The 
      secondary endpoints included skin thickness at 4 and 8 weeks and surface area, 
      expansion index, and skin texture score of the expanded skin at 12 weeks. Safety 
      assessments, for infection symptoms and nodule formation, were assessed at 24 
      weeks. RESULTS: In total, 26 patients were enrolled and assigned to the CGF or 
      control group. Compared with the control group, the CGF group had significantly 
      increased skin thickness at 8 (control, 1.1 +/- 0.1 mm; CGF, 1.4 +/- 0.1 mm; -0.6 to 
      0.0 mm; P = 0.047) and 12 weeks (control, 1.0 +/- 0.1 mm; CGF, 1.3 +/- 0.1 mm; -0.6 
      to 0.0 mm; P = 0.047). Compared with the baseline thickness (control, 1.6 +/- 0.1 
      mm; CGF, 1.5 +/- 0.1 mm; -0.3 to 0.5 mm; P = 0.987), skin thickness was sustained 
      in the CGF group at 8 weeks after treatment (-0.1 to 0.3 mm; P = 0.711) but 
      decreased in the control group (0.3 to 0.7 mm; P < 0.001). At 12 weeks, the CGF 
      group showed greater increases in surface area (control, 77.7 +/- 18.5 cm 2 ; CGF, 
      135.0 +/- 15.7 cm 2 ; 7.2 cm 2 to 107.4 cm 2 ; P = 0.027) and expansion index 
      (control, 0.9 +/- 0.1; CGF, 1.4 +/- 0.2; 0.0 to 0.8; P = 0.030) than the control 
      group. In addition, CGF-treated skin showed an improvement in texture [CGF: grade 
      3, n = 2 (15.8%), grade 2, n = 4 (30.7%); control: grade 3, n = 0 (0.0%), grade 
      2, n = 3 (23.0%)]. No severe adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: CGF treatment 
      increases skin thickness and area during tissue expansion, and represents a safe 
      and effective strategy for managing skin expansion. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: 
      The findings of this study indicate that it is practically feasible to improve 
      skin regeneration by applying autologous platelet concentrate therapy for skin 
      expansion management. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, II.

TI  - Secondary Breast Reconstruction in Irradiated Patients: Prospective Trial 
      Comparing DIEP to Brava Expansion and Fat Transplantation.
PG  - 205e-216e
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000010250 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autologous tissue reconstruction of the breast is preferable after 
      irradiation. Fat transplantation is a possible alternative. The aim of this 
      prospective trial was to compare outcomes of deep inferior epigastric perforator 
      (DIEP) flaps to Brava expansion and fat grafting, after mastectomy and 
      irradiation. METHODS: Patients were recruited among the candidates for delayed 
      breast reconstruction after mastectomy and irradiation and were given the same 
      information on both methods. Twenty-six patients underwent DIEP reconstruction, 
      and 31 patients had multiple fat grafting sessions after Brava external tissue 
      expansion. Outcomes were evaluated using the BREAST-Q questionnaire and the 
      Telemark Breast Score. RESULTS: Twenty-four of 31 patients in the fat graft group 
      completed the study. Six to nine operative sessions were required to gain a mean 
      volume of about 490 mL. The mean total operative time was 11.5 hours. Four 
      patients in this group developed a new primary or metastatic cancer disease 
      during the study. Twenty-four of 26 patients in the DIEP group completed the 
      study. The mean total operative time was 8 hours. The mean volume of the 
      reconstructed breast was 523 mL. Telemark Breast Score values showed similar 
      improvements in both groups at short terms of 3 months in the Brava group and 6 
      months in the DIEP group. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementary surgical procedures are 
      often needed in breast reconstruction after mastectomy with irradiation using 
      Brava external expansion and fat grafting. Even though the aesthetic results 
      evaluated by surgeons were comparable, patients were more satisfied with outcomes 
      after DIEP reconstruction compared with Brava expansion and fat grafting.

TI  - Different Types of Deletions Created by Low-Copy Repeats Sequences Location in 
      22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome: Genotype-Phenotype Correlation.
LID - 10.3390/genes13112083 [doi]
LID - 2083
AB  - The most frequent microdeletion, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), has a 
      wide and variable phenotype that causes difficulties in diagnosis. 22q11.2DS is a 
      contiguous gene syndrome, but due to the existence of several low-copy-number 
      repeat sequences (LCR) it displays a high variety of deletion types: typical 
      deletions LCR A-D-the most common (~90%), proximal deletions LCR A-B, central 
      deletions (LCR B, C-D) and distal deletions (LCR D-E, F). METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective study of 59 22q11.2SD cases, with the aim of highlighting 
      phenotype-genotype correlations. All cases were tested using MLPA combined kits: 
      SALSA MLPA KIT P245 and P250 (MRC Holland). RESULTS: most cases (76%) presented 
      classic deletion LCR A-D with various severity and phenotypic findings. A total 
      of 14 atypical new deletions were identified: 2 proximal deletions LCR A-B, 1 CES 
      (Cat Eye Syndrome region) to LCR B deletion, 4 nested deletions LCR B-D and 1 LCR 
      C-D, 3 LCR A-E deletions, 1 LCR D-E, and 2 small single gene deletions: delDGCR8 
      and delTOP3B. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the wide phenotypic variety and 
      incomplete penetrance of 22q11.2DS. Our findings contribute to the 
      genotype-phenotype data regarding different types of 22q11.2 deletions and 
      illustrate the usefulness of MLPA combined kits in 22q11.2DS diagnosis.

TI  - Noninvasive Soft Tissue Expansion Strips and Wound Complications After Total 
      Ankle Arthroplasty.
PG  - 1540-1547
LID - 10.1177/10711007221120024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Total ankle arthroplasty through the anterior approach (TAR-AA) is an 
      increasingly popular treatment for ankle arthritis, but it carries a known risk 
      for wound complications. Several products have been investigated to mitigate this 
      risk; however, most are either costly or invasive. Noninvasive skin expansion 
      strips (NSESs) were designed to transfer tension away from the incision and 
      induce new skin growth at the edges of the strips. We hypothesize that 
      postoperative application of NSESs will decrease unplanned clinic visits and 
      wound complications after TAR-AA. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 
      41 patients at a single institution (3 surgeons) treated with NSESs after 
      undergoing TAR-AA. An additional 41 consecutive historical patients treated 
      without NSESs were retrospectively included as a control group. Patients received 
      application of NSESs in the operating room after routine wound closure and again 
      2 weeks postoperatively. No other changes were made to the surgeons' wound 
      closure technique, immobilization, follow-up timing, or rehabilitation protocols. 
      Primary outcomes included (1) additional clinic visit required for wound 
      assessment or suture removal, (2) superficial wound complication, and (3) deep 
      infection. RESULTS: Baseline demographics did not differ significantly from our 
      41 consecutively treated historical controls. Additional clinic visits for suture 
      removal or wound evaluation were significantly lower for patients treated with 
      NSESs (15%, 6 of 41) compared to the control group (49%, 20 of 41) (P = .001). 
      There was also a significant difference in the superficial wound complication 
      rate in the treatment group vs control group, 2% and 12%, respectively (P = .04). 
      There were no deep infections in either group. CONCLUSION: Noninvasive skin 
      expansion strips placed after TAR-AA with an anterior approach have the potential 
      to decrease wound complications and unplanned clinic visits. Further high-volume 
      or randomized studies are needed to clarify their cost effectiveness and effect 
      on long-term outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prospective cohort study.

TI  - Xiehuo Xiaoying decoction inhibits Tfh cell expansion and promotes Tfr cell 
      amplification to ameliorate Graves' disease.
PG  - 115826

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Xiehuo Xiaoying decoction (XHXY) has shown great 
      potential in the treatment of GD, but its mechanism remains obscure. Increase of 
      follicular helper T (Tfh) cells and reduction of follicular regulatory T (Tfr) 
      cells contribute to a high thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb) level and 
      possible Graves' disease (GD). Oxidative stress (OS) disrupts T helper cell 
      differentiation and aggravates autoimmunity. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed 
      to investigate whether XHXY decoction can ameliorate autoimmunity in GD via 
      inhibiting OS and regulating Tfh and Tfr cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The main 
      XHXY bioactive compounds were identified using high-performance liquid 
      chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. GD was induced in the 
      mice through three intramuscular injections of adenovirus expressing the TSH 
      receptor. Then, the mice received oral gavage of XHXY (17 g/kg.d) and 34 g/kg.d) 
      for 4 weeks. OS indicators were assessed. Flow cytometry was used to confirm the 
      proportion of Tfh and Tfr cells in the lymph nodes and spleens of the mice. 
      Cytokine expression levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay. Factors including interleukin-21, B-cell lymphoma-6, and forkhead box P3 
      (Foxp3) were detected using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The mRNA and 
      protein expression levels of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), nuclear 
      factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and haem oxygenase 1 (HO-1) were 
      detected using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, 
      respectively. RESULTS: Twelve main ingredients of XHXY were identified. XHXY 
      relieved GD by lowering thyroxine (p < 0.01) and TRAb levels (p < 0.01). XHXY 
      ameliorated OS by decreasing the levels of NADPH oxidase 2 (p < 0.05), 
      4-hydroxynonenal (p < 0.01), and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (p < 0.001). It 
      inhibited Tfh cell expansion (p < 0.05), as well as the production of cytokine 
      interleukin -21 (p < 0.01), interleukin -4 (p < 0.01) and transcription factor 
      B-cell lymphoma 6 (p < 0.05). XHXY also induced Tfr cell amplification 
      (p < 0.05), increased the production of interleukin -10 (p < 0.05) and 
      transforming growth factor beta (p < 0.05) and the mRNA levels of Foxp3 (p < 0.05). 
      Finally, the Tfh/Tfr ratio returned to normal. In addition, XHXY activated Nrf2 
      and HO-1 expression, but inhibited Keap1 activation. CONCLUSIONS: XHXY relieves 
      autoimmunity in GD via inhibiting Tfh cell amplification and Tfr cell reduction, 
      a mechanism which probably involves the Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by the intronic insertion of a SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposon 
      carrying an (AGAGGG)(n) repeat expansion in the TAF1 gene. The molecular 
      mechanisms by which this mutation causes neurodegeneration remain elusive. 
      OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether (AGAGGG)(n) repeats undergo repeat-associated 
      non-AUG (RAN) translation, a pathogenic mechanism common among repeat expansion 
      diseases. METHODS: XDP-specific RAN translation reporter plasmids were generated, 
      transfected in HEK293 cells, and putative dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) were 
      detected by Western blotting. Immunocytochemistry was performed in COS-7 cells to 
      determine the subcellular localization of one DPR. RESULTS: We detected putative 
      DPRs from two reading frames, supporting the translation of poly-(Glu-Gly) and 
      poly-(Arg-Glu) species. XDP RAN translation initiates within the (AGAGGG)(n) 
      sequence and poly-(Glu-Gly) DPRs formed nuclear inclusions in transfected cells. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our work provides the first in-vitro proof of principle 
      that the XDP-linked (AGAGGG)(n) repeat expansions can undergo RAN translation. (c)

AB  - X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder 
      that primarily affects adult Filipino men. It is caused by a founder 
      retrotransposon insertion in TAF1 that contains a hexanucleotide repeat, the 
      number of which differs among the patients and correlates with the age at disease 
      onset (AAO) and other clinical parameters. A recent work has identified 
      additional genetic modifiers of age-associated penetrance in XDP, bringing to 
      light the DNA mismatch repair genes MSH3 and PMS2. Despite X-linked recessive 
      inheritance, a minor subset of patients are female, manifesting the disease via 
      various mechanisms such as homozygosity, imbalanced X-chromosome inactivation, or 
      aneuploidy. Here, we summarize and discuss clinical and genetic aspects of XDP, 
      with a focus on variable disease expressivity as a consequence of subtle genetic 
      differences within a seemingly homogenous population of patients.

TI  - Variation in TAF1 expression in female carrier induced pluripotent stem cells and 
      human brain ontogeny has implications for adult neostriatum vulnerability in 
      X-linked Dystonia Parkinsonism.
LID - ENEURO.0129-22.2022 [pii]
LID - 10.1523/ENEURO.0129-22.2022 [doi]
AB  - X-linked Dystonia-Parkinsonism (XDP) is an inherited, X-linked, adult-onset 
      movement disorder characterized by degeneration in the neostriatum. No 
      therapeutics alter disease progression. The mechanisms underlying regional 
      differences in degeneration and adult onset are unknown. Developing therapeutics 
      requires a deeper understanding of how XDP-relevant features vary in health and 
      disease. XDP is possibly due, in part, to a partial loss of TAF1 function. A 
      disease-specific SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) retrotransposon insertion occurs within 
      intron 32 of TAF1, a subunit of TFIID involved in transcription initiation. While 
      all XDP males are usually clinically affected, females are heterozygous carriers 
      generally not manifesting the full syndrome. As a resource for disease modeling, 
      we characterized eight iPSC lines from three XDP female carrier individuals for X 
      chromosome inactivation status and identified clonal lines that express either 
      the wild-type X or XDP haplotype. Furthermore, we characterized XDP-relevant 
      transcript expression in neurotypical humans, and found that SVA-F expression 
      decreases after 30 years of age in the brain and that TAF1 is decreased in most 
      female samples. Uniquely in the caudate nucleus, TAF1 expression is not sexually 
      dimorphic and decreased after adolescence. These findings indicate that 
      regional-, age- and sex-specific mechanisms regulate TAF1, highlighting the 
      importance of disease-relevant models and postmortem tissue. We propose that the 
      decreased TAF1 expression in the adult caudate may synergize with the 
      XDP-specific partial loss of TAF1 function in patients, thereby passing a minimum 
      threshold of TAF1 function, and triggering degeneration in the 
      neostriatum.Significance StatementXDP is an inherited, X-linked, adult-onset 
      movement disorder characterized by degeneration in the neostriatum. No 
      therapeutics alter disease progression. Developing therapeutics requires a deeper 
      understanding of how XDP-relevant features vary in health and disease. XDP is 
      possibly due to a partial loss of TAF1 function. While all XDP males are usually 
      affected, females are heterozygous carriers generally not manifesting the full 
      syndrome. As a resource for disease modeling, we characterized eight stem cell 
      lines from XDP female carrier individuals. Furthermore, we found that, uniquely 
      in the caudate nucleus, TAF1 expression decreases after adolescence in healthy 
      humans. We hypothesize that the decrease of TAF1 after adolescence in human 
      caudate, in general, may underlie the vulnerability of the adult neostriatum in 
      XDP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present prospective clinical study aimed to investigate the 
      effects of rapid maxillary expansion on the airway, correlating airway volumes 
      obtained on multi-slice computed tomography and polysomnography assessment of 
      oxygen saturation and apnea/hypopnea index. METHODS: Twenty-four patients (11 
      with obstructive sleep apnea and 13 with residual snoring, mean age 10.0 (1.8), 
      were enrolled in the study. Each patient underwent multislice computed tomography 
      and nocturnal polysomnography before rapid maxillary expansion and after removal 
      of maxillary expansion after six months. Airway regions were segmented, and 
      volumes were computed. RESULTS: The increase in oropharyngeal volume was 
      significant in both groups. Oxygen saturation and apnea/hypopnea index were not 
      statistically significant. No correlation was found between total airway volume, 
      oxygen saturation, and apnea/hypopnea index changes between the time points 
      examined. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that when rapid maxillary expansion is 
      performed in individuals with sleep-disordered breathing, there were 
      statistically significant differences in oropharyngeal volume between pre- and 
      post-rapid maxillary expansion, but there was no correlation between oxygen 
      saturation values and oropharyngeal volume increase. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: The 
      article is classified as Evidence Level 3 (Three).

TI  - Ten Years of Posterior Cranial Vault Expansion by Means of Distraction 
      Osteogenesis: An Update and Critical Evaluation.
PG  - 379-391
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000009336 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to describe the 10-year evolution of the 
      authors' surgical technique and institutional perioperative outcomes using 
      posterior vault distraction osteogenesis (PVDO) in patients with syndromic and 
      multisuture craniosynostosis. METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective 
      cohort study of patients who underwent PVDO for treatment of syndromic and 
      multisuture craniosynostosis at a single institution over a 10-year period. 
      Demographic data, perioperative outcomes, distraction patterns, and complications 
      were analyzed. Outcomes of patients in the first 5 years (early cohort) were 
      compared with those of the latter 5 years (late cohort). RESULTS: One hundred ten 
      patients underwent a total of 118 PVDO procedures. Patients with a syndromic 
      diagnosis represented 83.6 percent of the cohort ( n = 92) and were significantly 
      younger than patients with a nonsyndromic diagnosis at the time of first PVDO 
      (median [25th percentile, 75th percentile] 14.1 [6.6, 40.1] versus 42.7 [15.2, 
      59.6] months; p = 0.014). Mean distraction distance in the anterior-posterior 
      direction was 30.8 mm (SD, 7.4). Compared with the early cohort, PVDO in the late 
      cohort had faster median operative times (144.0 [123.0, 189.0] minutes versus 
      161.0 [138.0, 199.0] minutes; p = 0.038), lower estimated blood loss as a 
      percentage of blood volume (28.5 [20.6, 45.3] versus 50.0 [31.1, 95.8]; p < 
      0.001), and lower blood replacement as percentage of blood volume (39.5 [23.8, 
      59.1] versus 56.3 [37.8, 110.1]; p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: This 10-year experience 
      with PVDO demonstrates continued overall safety and efficacy with improved 
      perioperative outcomes over time. Although PVDO has become the authors' first 
      line of expansion in syndromic craniosynostosis, shortcomings such as need for 
      device removal, infection concerns, and potential for cerebrospinal fluid leak 
      merit attention by the craniofacial community. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III.

TI  - Mosaic divergent repeat interruptions in XDP influence repeat stability and 
      disease onset.
PG  - 1075-1082
LID - 10.1093/brain/awac160 [doi]
AB  - While many genetic causes of movement disorders have been identified, modifiers 
      of disease expression are largely unknown. X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) 
      is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a SINE-VNTR-Alu(AGAGGG)n retrotransposon 
      insertion in TAF1, with a polymorphic (AGAGGG)n repeat. Repeat length and 
      variants in MSH3 and PMS2 explain  approximately 65% of the variance in age at onset (AAO) in 
      XDP. However, additional genetic modifiers are conceivably at play in XDP, such 
      as repeat interruptions. Long-read nanopore sequencing of PCR amplicons from XDP 
      patients (n = 202) was performed to assess potential repeat interruption and 
      instability. Repeat-primed PCR and Cas9-mediated targeted enrichment confirmed 
      the presence of identified divergent repeat motifs. In addition to the canonical 
      pure SINE-VNTR-Alu-5'-(AGAGGG)n, we observed a mosaic of divergent repeat motifs 
      that polarized at the beginning of the tract, where the divergent repeat 
      interruptions varied in motif length by having one, two, or three nucleotides 
      fewer than the hexameric motif, distinct from interruptions in other 
      disease-associated repeats, which match the lengths of the canonical motifs. All 
      divergent configurations occurred mosaically and in two investigated brain 
      regions (basal ganglia, cerebellum) and in blood-derived DNA from the same 
      patient. The most common divergent interruption was AGG 
      [5'-SINE-VNTR-Alu(AGAGGG)2AGG(AGAGGG)n], similar to the pure tract, followed by 
      AGGG [5'-SINE-VNTR-Alu(AGAGGG)2AGGG(AGAGGG)n], at median frequencies of 0.425 
      (IQR: 0.42-0.43) and 0.128 (IQR: 0.12-0.13), respectively. The mosaic AGG motif 
      was not associated with repeat number (estimate = -3.8342, P = 0.869). The mosaic 
      pure tract frequency was associated with repeat number (estimate = 45.32, P = 
      0.0441) but not AAO (estimate = -41.486, P = 0.378). Importantly, the mosaic 
      frequency of the AGGG negatively correlated with repeat number after adjusting 
      for age at sampling (estimate = -161.09, P = 3.44 x 10-5). When including the 
      XDP-relevant MSH3/PMS2 modifier single nucleotide polymorphisms into the model, 
      the mosaic AGGG frequency was associated with AAO (estimate = 155.1063, P = 
      0.047); however, the association dissipated after including the repeat number 
      (estimate = -92.46430, P = 0.079). We reveal novel mosaic divergent repeat 
      interruptions affecting both motif length and sequence (DRILS) of the canonical 
      motif polarized within the SINE-VNTR-Alu(AGAGGG)n repeat. Our study illustrates: 
      (i) the importance of somatic mosaic genotypes; (ii) the biological plausibility 
      of multiple modifiers (both germline and somatic) that can have additive effects 
      on repeat instability; and (iii) that these variations may remain undetected 
      without assessment of single molecules.

AB  - X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is a progressive adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by insertion of a SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) 
      retrotransposon in the TAF1 gene. The SVA retrotransposon contains a CCCTCT 
      hexameric repeat tract of variable length, whose length is inversely correlated 
      with age at onset. This places XDP in a broader class of repeat expansion 
      diseases, characterized by the instability of their causative repeat mutations. 
      Here, we observe similar inverse correlations between CCCTCT repeat length with 
      age at onset and age at death and no obvious correlation with disease duration. 
      To gain insight into repeat instability in XDP we performed comprehensive 
      quantitative analyses of somatic instability of the XDP CCCTCT repeat in blood 
      and in seventeen brain regions from affected males. Our findings reveal repeat 
      length-dependent and expansion-based instability of the XDP CCCTCT repeat, with 
      greater levels of expansion in brain than in blood. The brain exhibits 
      regional-specific patterns of instability that are broadly similar across 
      individuals, with cerebellum exhibiting low instability and cortical regions 
      exhibiting relatively high instability. The spectrum of somatic instability in 
      the brain includes a high proportion of moderate repeat length changes of up to 5 
      repeats, as well as expansions of ~ 20- > 100 repeats and contractions of ~ 20-40 
      repeats at lower frequencies. Comparison with HTT CAG repeat instability in 
      postmortem Huntington's disease brains reveals similar brain region-specific 
      profiles, indicating common trans-acting factors that contribute to the 
      instability of both repeats. Analyses in XDP brains of expansion of a different 
      SVA-associated CCCTCT located in the LIPG gene, and not known to be 
      disease-associated, reveals repeat length-dependent expansion at overall lower 
      levels relative to the XDP CCCTCT repeat, suggesting that expansion propensity 
      may be modified by local chromatin structure. Together, the data support a role 
      for repeat length-dependent somatic expansion in the process(es) driving the 
      onset of XDP and prompt further investigation into repeat dynamics and the 
      relationship to disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, by a three-dimensional study, the volumetric and 
      integumentary effects of rapid maxillary expansion on the nose, in mouth 
      breathing kids with maxillary hypoplasia, in the short term, assessing the 
      possible interference of gender, growth and age on the results achieved. METHODS: 
      120 mouth breathing patients with maxilla hypoplasia were divided into an 
      Experimental Group treated by rapid maxillary expansion (n...=...104, 62 males and 42 
      females, mean age 10.1 years, SD...=...2.10, ranging from 5.1 to 13.9 years); and 
      Control Group, constituted by 16 patients (9 males and 7 females, mean age 9.3 
      years, SD...=...2.1 years, ranging from 6.1 to 13.2 years). Patients in the 
      experimental group underwent multislice computed tomography examinations at two 
      different times: (T1) pre-expansion and (T2) post-expansion. The control group 
      was submitted to the same tests at the same time intervals. Six soft tissue 
      variables of the nose were studied, besides the volume and area of the nasal 
      cavity, and the measurement and comparison of data between T1 and T2 were 
      performed using the Dolphin Imaging 11.7 Premium software. RESULTS: The 
      experimental group showed significant mean increases in all soft tissue variables 
      studied (p...<...0.005), yet there were no significant changes in the control group. 
      In the comparison between groups, only inclination of the nasal dorsum did not 
      present any significant change. CONCLUSION: Rapid maxillary expansion may alter 
      the nasal shape and physiology, by anatomical changes in the nose soft tissues, 
      making it an important aid in the treatment of mouth breathing in childhood. 
      LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: The soft tissues of the nose play an important role in nasal 
      shape and physiology and facial esthetics, and since they are directly related to 
      the nasal valves, they are fundamental for maintenance and stability of the nasal 
      breathing pattern.

TI  - Impact of Medicaid Expansion on Rhinologic Cancer Presentation, Treatment, and 
      Outcomes.
PG  - 43-50
LID - 10.1002/lary.30049 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act allocated 
      funds for states to expand Medicaid coverage. However, several states declined 
      expansion. We aim to determine whether Medicaid expansion is associated with 
      healthcare coverage, cancer stage at diagnosis, treatment, and survival among 
      patients with rhinologic cancer. Rhinologic cancer was defined to include cancer 
      of the nasal cavity, paranasal sinus, nasopharynx, or olfactory nerve. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with primary rhinologic 
      malignancies between 2007 to 2016 were extracted from the National Cancer 
      Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, End Results (SEER) registry. Patients were 
      grouped by diagnosis before and after 2014 (when Medicaid expansion became 
      effective) and whether their state had expanded Medicaid. Multivariable logistic 
      regression controlling for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and income/education was 
      utilized to examine associations between Medicaid expansion/insurance status and 
      stage at diagnosis, treatment, and survival. Overall and disease-specific 
      survival were examined using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Analysis included 
      10,164 patients. The proportion of uninsured patients decreased after 2014 (2.4%) 
      compared to before 2014 (4.8%, P < .001). After 2014, patients in nonexpanded 
      states were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease compared to 
      patients in expanded states (N = 2,364; OR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.01-1.60). Being 
      uninsured in any state was associated with advanced stage disease at diagnosis 
      (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.41-2.22) and increased risk of disease-specific death 
      (HR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.32-1.82). Survival measures were not associated with 
      diagnosis before versus after 2014 or Medicaid expansion. CONCLUSIONS: Patients 
      lacking insurance or residing in nonexpanded states may be more likely to present 
      with advanced stage rhinologic cancer. Longitudinal studies should validate these 
      findings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 Laryngoscope, 133:43-50, 2023.

PG  - 319-324
LID - 10.1515/medgen-2021-2105 [doi]
AB  - X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative movement 
      disorder, caused by a founder retrotransposon insertion in an intron of the TAF1 
      gene. This insertion contains a polymorphic hexanucleotide repeat (CCCTCT)(n), 
      the length of which inversely correlates with the age at disease onset (AAO) and 
      other clinical parameters, aligning XDP with repeat expansion disorders. 
      Nevertheless, many other pathogenic mechanisms are conceivably at play in XDP, 
      indicating that in contrast to other repeat disorders, the (CCCTCT)(n) repeat may 
      not be the actual (or only) disease cause. Here, we summarize and discuss genetic 
      and molecular aspects of XDP, highlighting the role of the hexanucleotide repeat 
      in age-related disease penetrance and expressivity.

      Pharyngeal Collapse.
PG  - 1313-1319
LID - 10.1002/lary.29999 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: This study was aimed to compare the efficiency of the 
      anterior palatoplasty and expansion sphincter pharyngoplasty (APwESP) technique 
      for all patterns of velopharyngeal obstruction (anterior-posterior [APPC], 
      lateral [LPC], or combined circular pharyngeal collapse [CPC]). STUDY DESIGN: The 
      study was designed as a randomized prospective trial at Katip Celebi University, 
      Ataturk Training, and Research Hospital. METHODS: Patients only with 
      velopharyngeal obstruction were included. Three groups were created according to 
      the obstruction pattern (APPC, LPC, and CPC) for the study. Outcome parameters 
      included patient's demographics, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), lowest oxygen 
      saturation (LOS), Stanford subjective scale of snoring (SSSS), and Epworth 
      sleepiness scale (ESS). RESULTS: Thirty-one (34.1%) patients were in APPC group, 
      while 30 (33.0%) patients were in LPC, and 30 (33.0%) were in CPC group. 
      Preoperatively for all patients, on average, AHI was 33.4 +/- 13.6, SSSS was 
      8.3 +/- 1.0, ESS was 16.5 +/- 2.6, and LOS was determined as 85.5 +/- 3.6. There was a 
      significant postoperative improvement in all parameters for all patients. There 
      was no significant difference in outcome parameters between the groups according 
      to obstruction pattern postoperatively. After APwESP surgery, obstruction pattern 
      was not a significant factor for AHI (P = .234), SSSS (P = .180), and LOS 
      (P = .280) (repeated measure analysis of variance test). The rate of surgical 
      success was detected similarly for both of the study groups (P = .435). The rate 
      of successful surgery for severe obstructive sleep apnea in the APPC group was 
      72.2%, 88.2% in the LPC group, and 75.0% in the CPC group (P = .472). CONCLUSION: 
      A combination of APwESP surgery can manage all types of pharyngeal obstruction 
      confidently. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 Laryngoscope, 132:1313-1319, 2022.

TI  - Time Matters: Knee Cartilage Defect Expansion and High-Grade Lesion Formation 
      while Awaiting Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation.
PG  - 1802S-1808S
LID - 10.1177/19476035211063866 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess potential risk factors, 
      including time delay until implantation, for knee cartilage defect expansion or 
      new high-grade defect formation between biopsy and Autologous Chondrocyte 
      Implantation (ACI) or Matrix Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (MACI). STUDY 
      DESIGN: Consecutive knee ACI and MACI cases by a single surgeon (n = 111) were 
      reviewed. The relationship between time between biopsy and staged implantation 
      and (1) progression in primary cartilage defect size and (2) development of a new 
      high-grade (Outerbridge grade >/=3) cartilage defect were determined with 
      adjustment for demographics, body mass index, smoking status, coronal alignment, 
      initial cartilage status, and prior surgery. RESULTS: Average size of the primary 
      defect at time of biopsy was 4.50 cm(2). Mean time to chondrocyte implantation 
      was 155 days. Defect expansion increased 0.11 cm(2) (standard error = 0.03) per 
      month delay to implantation (P = 0.001). Independent predictors of defect 
      expansion were male sex, smaller initial defect size, and delay to implantation 
      (adjusted mean = 0.15 cm(2) expansion per month). A total of 16.2% of patients (n 
      = 18/111) developed a new high-grade defect. Independent predictors of a new 
      secondary defect were Outerbridge grade 2 changes (vs. 0-1) on the surface 
      opposing the index defect and delayed implantation (per month increase, adjusted 
      odds ratio = 1.21, 95% confidence interval: 1.01-1.44; P = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Patients undergoing 2-stage cell-based cartilage restoration with either ACI or 
      MACI demonstrated long delays between stages of surgery, placing them at risk for 
      expanding defects and development of new high-grade cartilage defects. Patients 
      who were male, had smaller initial defect size, and longer time between surgeries 
      were at greater risk for defect expansion. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, retrospective 
      comparative study.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective longitudinal study of patients operated on 
      consecutively in a single center from May to October 2019. PURPOSE: The aim in 
      biportal interlaminar endoscopic decompression surgery for lumbar stenosis is to 
      compare the clinical and radiological outcome of lateral recess decompression and 
      facet preservation, employing ipsilateral (IL) versus contralateral (CL) 
      approaches. OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: There is scant literature comparing the 
      radiological outcome of lateral recess decompression and facet preservation via 
      IL versus CL approaches in patients undergoing biportal interlaminar endoscopic 
      decompression surgery. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed 37 IL 
      and 34 CL approaches. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging of the segment 
      involved was carried out on the same day as the operation for comparison with 
      preoperative imaging. Radiological assessments of recess angle, recess height, 
      facet length, and recess dural sac diameters were compared. In addition, pre- and 
      postoperative Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores for the lower limb were 
      analyzed. RESULTS: For IL versus CL approaches, we observed statistical 
      differences in the postoperative recess angle (36.0 degrees  vs. 43.7 degrees ), recess height 
      (4.27 vs. 5.06 mm), and the dural sac expansion ratio for recess diameter (1.54 
      vs. 2.17). There was better preservation of facet length in the CL approach than 
      in the IL approach (91.9% vs. 83.7%). There was no difference in VAS improvement 
      between the groups (69.3% vs. 63.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral biportal 
      decompression via the CL interlaminar approach may offer better lateral recess 
      clearance and facet preservation than can be achieved via the IL approach. 
      Larger-scale studies are needed for better delineation and for correlation of 
      radiological features with clinical manifestations.

TI  - Two- and Three-Segment Surgically Assisted Rapid Maxillary Expansion: A Clinical 
      Trial.
PG  - 1086-1097
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000008491 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The literature shows no consensus on whether two- or three-segment 
      surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion is the best operative technique. 
      METHODS: The present clinical trial was designed to compare the outcome of two- 
      and three-segment osteotomy surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion. 
      Thirty-two adult patients with transverse maxillary deficiency greater than or 
      equal to 5 mm were randomly assigned to two- and three-segment groups (n = 16). 
      Dimensional and psychological assessments (Oral Health Impact Profile and 
      Brazilian Orthognathic Quality of Life Questionnaire) were carried out before 
      surgical intervention and at one of the following time points: completion of 
      expansion, removal of expanding device, 6 months after completion of expansion, 
      or 10 months after completion of expansion. Dimensional assessments for 
      asymmetric expansion of the maxilla and for changes in the area and volume of the 
      palatine vault were performed on digital data from tomographic and laser scanning 
      with the aid of an engineering inspection software. RESULTS: No statistically 
      significant differences were found in asymmetry or stability outcomes between 
      groups. The psychological benefit provided by the three-segment technique did not 
      spread through the domains of the quality-of-life questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The current findings suggest that three-segment surgically assisted rapid 
      maxillary expansion outcomes do not exceed those obtained with its two-segment 
      counterpart regarding symmetry of maxillary expansion and stability of area and 
      volume of the palatine vault. Furthermore, psychological nuances evidenced in 
      two- and three-segment groups with the tools used play a limited, short-lasting 
      role, or a specific, more sensitive assessment tool needs to be developed.

AB  - Engineered liver organogenesis is not yet a viable therapeutic option, but 
      ectopic liver histogenesis may be possible. Accumulating evidence has suggested 
      that cell-cell interactions and cell-matrix interactions play an important role 
      in determining the properties of engineered hepatic tissue in vitro and in vivo. 
      In the current study, we utilized heparinized decellularized liver scaffolds and 
      bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell spheroids to fabricate engineered hepatic 
      tissue, which was subsequently implanted into the omentum of Sprague-Dawley rats 
      with or without liver injury. The survival, liver-specific functions, 
      differentiation level and regenerative potential of the implanted hepatocyte-like 
      cells in this ectopic liver system were evaluated, together with the 
      vascularization status and therapeutic potential of the engineered hepatic 
      tissue. We demonstrated that these hepatic grafts could survive and possess 
      hepatocyte specific function in this ectopic liver system but could also 
      efficiently anastomose with host vascular networks. Furthermore, we found that 
      hepatocyte-like cells within grafts expanded more than 9-fold over the course of 
      4 weeks in immunocompetent rats with injured livers. Immunostaining revealed that 
      these hepatocyte-like cells could self-organize into cord-like structures in 
      vivo. In addition, these hepatic grafts exhibited therapeutic potential in liver 
      injury induced by CCl(4). To our knowledge, this is the first report 
      demonstrating the generation of long-term vascularized hepatic parenchyma at 
      ectopic sites based on decellularized liver scaffolds and stem cells. These 
      results provide an economic and feasible method for engineering hepatic tissue 
      from construction to transplantation. This methodology may be applicable in 
      clinical medicine, especially metabolic liver diseases. STATEMENT OF 
      SIGNIFICANCE: In this manuscript, we presented an optimized method for the 
      hepatic engineered tissue (HET) from construction to transplantation. The core of 
      this method is utilizing the combination of heparinized decellularized liver 
      scaffolds and stem cell spheroids, which could provide necessary cell-cell and 
      cell-extracellular matrix interactions for HET in vitro and in vivo. We proved 
      that these hepatic grafts could possess hepatocyte specific function and exhibit 
      strong proliferative activity in ectopic liver system, but also able to 
      anastomose with the host vascular networks efficiently and be compatible with the 
      host immune system. This methodology may be possible one day to apply in clinical 
      medicine, especially metabolic liver diseases.

TI  - GGC Repeat Expansion of NOTCH2NLC in Taiwanese Patients With Inherited 
      Neuropathies.
PG  - e199-e206
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000013008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The GGC repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region 
      of NOTCH2NLC was recently identified as the cause of neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusion disease (NIID), which may manifest with peripheral neuropathy. The aim 
      of this study is to investigate its contribution to inherited neuropathy. 
      METHODS: This cohort study screened patients with molecularly undiagnosed 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and healthy controls for the GGC repeat 
      expansion in NOTCH2NLC using repeat-primed PCR and fragment analysis. The 
      clinical and electrophysiologic features of the patients harboring the GGC repeat 
      expansion were scrutinized. Skin biopsy with immunohistochemistry staining and 
      electric microscopic imaging were performed. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-seven 
      unrelated patients with CMT, including 66 cases with axonal CMT (CMT2), and 200 
      healthy controls were included. Among them, 7 patients with CMT carried a variant 
      NOTCH2NLC allele with GGC repeat expansion, but it was absent in controls. The 
      sizes of the expanded GGC repeats ranged from 80 to 104 repeats. All 7 patients 
      developed sensory predominant neuropathy with an average age at disease onset of 
      37.1 years (range 21-55 years). Electrophysiologic studies revealed mild axonal 
      sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Leukoencephalopathy was absent in the 5 patients who 
      received a brain MRI. Skin biopsy from 2 patients showed eosinophilic, ubiquitin- 
      and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in the sweat gland cells and dermal 
      fibroblasts. Two of the 7 patients had a family history of NIID. DISCUSSION: The 
      NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions are an underdiagnosed and important cause of 
      inherited neuropathy. The expansion accounts for 10.6% (7 of 66) of molecularly 
      unassigned CMT2 cases in the Taiwanese CMT cohort. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: 
      This study provides Class III evidence that in Taiwanese patients with 
      genetically undiagnosed CMT, 10.6% of the CMT2 cases have the GGC repeat 
      expansion in NOTCH2NLC.

TI  - Brain Regional Differences in Hexanucleotide Repeat Length in X-Linked 
      Dystonia-Parkinsonism Using Nanopore Sequencing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our study investigated the presence of regional differences in 
      hexanucleotide repeat number in postmortem brain tissues of 2 patients with 
      X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP), a combined dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome 
      modified by a (CCCTCT)(n) repeat within the causal SINE-VNTR-Alu retrotransposon 
      insertion in the TAF1 gene. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from blood and 
      postmortem brain samples, including the basal ganglia and cortex from both 
      patients and from the cerebellum, midbrain, and pituitary gland from 1 patient. 
      Repeat sizing was performed using fragment analysis, small-pool PCR-based 
      Southern blotting, and Oxford nanopore sequencing. RESULTS: The basal ganglia (p 
      < 0.001) and cerebellum (p < 0.001) showed higher median repeat numbers and 
      higher degrees of repeat instability compared with blood. CONCLUSIONS: Somatic 
      repeat instability may predominate in brain regions selectively affected in XDP, 
      thereby hinting at its potential role in disease manifestation and modification.

TI  - Parameters of poor prognosis in preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic 
      disorders.
PG  - 2558-2566
LID - 10.1093/humrep/deab136 [doi]
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: What is the likelihood of success of a single cycle of 
      preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M), measured as the 
      cumulative live birth rate (CLBR) and based on various patient demographics? 
      SUMMARY ANSWER: For all women aged </=40 years, the CLBR was at least 10% when the 
      number of oocytes was >/=7 (range 10-30%) or was at least 5% when the number of 
      oocytes was >/=3 (range 5-17%). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The number of oocytes is 
      significantly associated with the number of embryos for genetic testing and the 
      clinical outcome in PGT-M. Embryos diagnosed as affected or embryos that remain 
      without diagnosis cannot be used for embryo transfer. The size of the group of 
      embryos non-suitable for transfer varies between 25% and 81%, depending on the 
      indication. Thus, PGT-M is more likely to be more severely impacted by suboptimal 
      ovarian response, poor fertilization and suboptimal embryo development than 
      conventional IVF/ICSI schemes without PGT. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was 
      a single-centre retrospective comparative cohort study, of cycles between January 
      2011 and December 2015. A total number of 2265 PGT-M cycles were compared to 2833 
      conventional ICSI cycles. The principal aim of our study was the identification 
      of the parameters of poor CLBR in couples undergoing PGT-M using multiplex short 
      tandem repeat (STR) markers on blastomere biopsy DNA. The secondary aim was to 
      compare the parameters of poor CLBR of the PGT-M population to those of couples 
      undergoing ICSI without PGT. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The 
      baseline characteristics of the PGT-M group were compared to the conventional 
      ICSI group. A multiple regression analysis was applied to account for the 
      following potential confounding factors: female age, number of previous ART 
      cycles, number of oocytes/suitable embryos for transfer and dosage of 
      gonadotrophins used for ovarian stimulation. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: 
      The PGT-M group was younger (female age 32.0 vs 34.5 years), had a higher number 
      of previous ART cycles (1.1 vs 0.9 cycles) and used more gonadotrophins (2367 vs 
      1984 IU). Per cycle, the PGT-M group had more retrieved oocytes (11.8 vs 8.3 
      oocytes), fewer suitable embryos for transfer (1.7 vs 2.8 embryos) and a lower 
      CLBR (29.4% vs 35.0%). Multiple regression analysis showed that the CLBR in the 
      PGT-M group was significantly influenced by female age, the number of previous 
      ART cycles, the number of oocytes and the dose of ovarian stimulation. In both 
      groups, the predicted CLBR increased with increasing numbers of oocytes and 
      suitable embryos. At least two retrieved oocytes or one embryo per single PGT-M 
      cycle could confer an estimated CLBR above 10%. By assessing female age and the 
      number of retrieved oocytes together, it was shown that for all women aged 
      </=40 years, the predicted CLBR per single PGT-M cycle was >/=10% when the number of 
      oocytes was >/=7 or was >/=5% when the number of oocytes was >/=3. LIMITATIONS, REASONS 
      FOR CAUTION: Despite the large sample size, the findings are confined by limited 
      confounder adjustment and the lack of specific PGT-M comparators. WIDER 
      IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study aimed to describe the likelihood of 
      success of PGT-M treatment, measured as CLBR, based on various patient 
      demographics. In a PGT-M program, couples need to be informed of the prognosis 
      more specifically when it is futile. The table of predicted CLBRs presented in 
      this study is a useful tool in counselling PGT-M couples for making reproductive 
      choices. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): No funding was required and there 
      are no competing interests. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: N/A.

AB  - Moderate to hyper-expansion of trinucleotide repeats at the FRAXA and FRAXE 
      fragile sites, with or without concurrent hypermethylation, has been associated 
      with intellectual disability and other conditions. Unlike molecular diagnosis of 
      FMR1 CGG repeat expansions in FRAXA, current detection of AFF2 CCG repeat 
      expansions in FRAXE relies on low-throughput and otherwise inefficient techniques 
      combining Southern blot analysis and PCR. A novel triplet-primed PCR assay was 
      developed for simultaneous screening for trinucleotide repeat expansions at the 
      FRAXA and FRAXE fragile sites, and was validated using archived clinical samples 
      of known FMR1 and AFF2 genotypes. Population samples and FRAXE-affected samples 
      were sequenced for the evaluation of variations in the AFF2 CCG repeat structure. 
      The duplex assay accurately identified expansions at the FMR1 and AFF2 
      trinucleotide repeat loci. On Sanger sequencing of the AFF2 CCG repeat, the 
      single-nucleotide polymorphism variant rs868914124(C) that effectively adds two 
      CCG repeats at the 5'-end, was enriched in the Malay population and with short 
      repeats (<11 CCGs), and was present in all six expanded AFF2 alleles of this 
      study. All expanded AFF2 alleles contained multiple non-CCG interruptions toward 
      the 5'-end of the repeat. A sensitive, robust, and rapid assay has been developed 
      for the simultaneous detection of expansion mutations at the FMR1 and AFF2 
      trinucleotide repeat loci, simplifying screening for FRAXA- and FRAXE-associated 
      disorders.

TI  - Quantitative Analysis of Nipple to Inframammary Fold Distance Variation in 
      Tuberous Breast Augmentation: Is there a Progressive Lower Pole Expansion?
PG  - 2017-2024
LID - 10.1007/s00266-021-02363-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In patients with short nipple to inframammary fold (N-IMF) 
      distance, as in tuberous breast, the cohesivity and gel distribution of shaped 
      implants work as a controlled tissue expander, progressively adapting the tissues 
      to the implant's shape. This phenomenon translates into a gradual increase of the 
      N-IMF distance over time, but the true extent to which this occurs has not been 
      quantified to date. This study aims to quantify the postoperative variation of 
      the N-IMF distance in tuberous breast treated with shaped cohesive silicone 
      breast implants. METHODS: We did a retrospective review of a prospective 
      maintained database of all consecutive patients with bilateral Groulleau I and II 
      tuberous breasts who underwent primary breast augmentation between April 2017 and 
      May 2018 at our institution. To quantify the lower mammary pole's morphological 
      changes, we evaluated the N-IMF distance under maximal stretch as an endpoint. We 
      recorded this value at time 0 (preoperative), immediate post-op (equivalent to 
      the distance planned preoperatively) and at month 1, month 6 and 1-year post-op. 
      Then we calculated the average N-IMF distance variation of our sample of patients 
      with a 99% interval of confidence for each breast obtained. Comparisons were 
      performed using the Sign test and the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: The average 
      implant weight was 353g (range 290-450; SD +/-46.147). Of the 54 breasts analyzed, 
      the immediate post-op N-IMF distance was on average 2.43 cm longer than the preop 
      IMF with a 99% confidence interval between 2.01 and 2.86 and SD of +/-1.22. The 
      mean difference between the preop N-IMF distance and after 1, 6 and 12 months was 
      respectively 2.78 cm (SD,1.56) (99% CI, 2.24-3.34), 3.08 cm (SD, 1.57) (99% CI, 
      2.53-3.64), and 3.36 (1.55) (99% CI, 2.82-3.91) Comparing immediate postoperative 
      nipple to inframammary fold distance (N-IMF) to the 1, 6 and 12 months N-IMF 
      values, an average of 4.23% (CI 1.3-7.16), 7.74% (CI 4.25-11.23) and 10.84% (CI 
      7.21-14.49) of skin length, was gained respectively. According to implants' 
      weight, subgroup analysis showed that implants > 400 g were associated with 
      significantly higher N-IMF distance increase (p <0.05) compared to implants < 
      400 g. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a significant progressive 
      postoperative increase in N-IMF distance should be expected in all cases of 
      tuberous breast augmentation with anatomical implants over a 1 year period. This 
      aspect may have an important implication on the IMF incision and the new fold 
      position preoperative planning. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV.

TI  - The expansion of no-touch harvesting sequential vein graft after off-pump 
      coronary artery bypass grafting.
PG  - 2381-2388
LID - 10.1111/jocs.15577 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Many studies support that the no-touch (NT) 
      procedure can improve the patency rate of vein grafts. However, it is not clear 
      that the sequential vein graft early expansion in the NT technique during 
      off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). This study will explore this 
      issue. METHODS: This was a prospective single-center randomized controlled 
      clinical trial. A total of 100 patients undergoing off-pump CABG with the 
      sequential saphenous graft were randomly assigned to two groups: the NT and 
      conventional (CON) groups. Perioperative and postoperative data were collected 
      during the hospital stay. The mean diameter of sequential grafts was measured 
      using cardiac computed tomography angiography 3 months after the operation. 
      RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the average diameter of sequential 
      grafts between the two groups (NT: [2.98 +/- 0.42], CON: [3.26 +/- 0.51], p = .005). 
      There was no difference in occlusion of sequential venous grafts between the two 
      groups (NT: 4/48 [8.3%], CON: 5/49 [10.2%], p = 1.000). There were differences in 
      surgery time between the two groups (NT: 220 [188,240], CON: 190 [175,230], 
      p = .009). CONCLUSIONS: The sequential graft early expansion in the NT technique 
      is not as pronounced as that in the conventional technique, which may have a 
      long-term protective effect on the grafts.

PG  - e2407-e2413
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000011823 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between CAG repeat length in the 
      huntingtin gene and cognitive performance in participants above and below the 
      disease threshold for Huntington disease (HD), we performed a cross-sectional 
      analysis of the Enroll-HD database. METHODS: We analyzed data from young, 
      developing adults (</=30 years of age) without a history of depression, apathy, or 
      cognitive deficits. We included participants with and without the gene expansion 
      (CAG >/=36) for HD. All participants had to have a Total Functional Capacity Score 
      of 13, a diagnostic confidence level of zero, and a total motor score of <10 and 
      had to be >28.6 years from their predicted motor onset. We performed regression 
      analyses to investigate the nonlinear relationship between CAG repeat length and 
      various cognitive measures controlling for age, sex, and education level. 
      RESULTS: There were significant positive relationships between CAG repeat length 
      and the Symbol Digit Modalities, Stroop Color Naming, and Stroop Interference 
      test scores. There were significant negative relationships between CAG repeat 
      length and scores on Parts A and B of the Trails Making Test (p < 0.05), 
      indicating that longer CAG repeat lengths were associated with better 
      performance. DISCUSSION: An increasing number of CAG repeats in the huntingtin 
      gene below disease threshold and low pathologic CAG ranges were associated with 
      some improvements in cognitive performance. These findings outline the 
      relationship between CAG repeats within the huntingtin gene and cognitive 
      development. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence 
      that CAG repeat length is positively associated with cognitive function across a 
      spectrum of CAG repeat lengths.

      and 100% in ACC. RFC1 disease was also identified in Western and Eastern Asian

      symptoms, and cough were strong positive discriminative predictors (>90%) against 
      RFC1-negative patients. The phenotype across 70 RFC1-positive patients was mostly 
      multisystemic (69%), including dysautonomia (62%) and bradykinesia (28%) (overlap 
      with cerebellar-type multiple system atrophy [MSA-C]), postural instability 
      (49%), slow vertical saccades (17%), and chorea or dystonia (11%). Ataxia 
      progression was  approximately 1.3 Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia points per 
      year (32 cross-sectional, 17 longitudinal assessments, follow-up </=9 years [mean 
      3.1 years]) but also included early falls, variable nonlinear phases of 
      MSA-C-like progression (SARA points 2.5-5.5 per year), and premature death. 
      Treatment trials require 330 (1-year trial) and 132 (2-year trial) patients in 
      total to detect 50% reduced progression. CONCLUSIONS: RFC1 disease is frequent 
      and occurs across continents, with CANVAS and ACC as highly diagnostic phenotypes 
      yet as variable, overlapping clusters along a continuous multisystemic disease 
      spectrum, including MSA-C-overlap. Our natural history data help to inform future 
      RFC1 treatment trials. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II 
      evidence that RFC1 repeat expansions are associated with CANVAS and ACC.

TI  - Hyoid expansion with titanium plate and screws with hyomandibular suspension: A 
      study on human cadavers with computed tomographic comparative analysis.
PG  - 1240-1246
LID - 10.1002/lio2.476 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnoea is characterized by repetitive obstruction 
      of the upper airway during sleep. These repeated oxygen desaturations increase 
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality significantly. Upper 
      airway surgery is an option for patients who fail continuous positive airway 
      pressure therapy. Airway collapse is usually multilevel and hypopharyngeal 
      collapse is a challenging area to address. It is hypothesized that hyoid 
      expansion with hyomandibular suspension can potentially increase upper airway 
      dimensions at the hypopharynx. This study aims to document the effect of hyoid 
      expansion using titanium plate and screws with hyomandibular suspension on 
      hypopharyngeal airway dimensions. It is an anatomical feasibility study performed 
      using 10 human cadaver heads. METHODS: The hyoid bone is trifractured. The 
      expanded hyoid is then suspended to the mandible. Computed tomography (CT) scans 
      were performed on the cadavers to measure the airway dimensions before and after 
      the procedure. RESULTS: This procedure resulted in statistically significant 
      increase in airway dimensions at the level of the hypopharynx in all 10 human 
      cadaver heads. Increase in cross-sectional area correlated significantly with 
      increase in 3-dimentional (3D) volume.The mean area of the airway at the level of 
      the hyoid increased from 999.3 +/- 193.0 mm(2) to 1241.4 +/- 103.2 mm(2). 
      Statistically significant increase in upper airway volume based on 3D 
      reconstruction was also noted. Upper airway volume increased from 6.94 +/- 6.46 mL 
      to 13.58 +/- 8.29 mL. CONCLUSION: Airway dimensions increased with hyoid expansion 
      and hyomandibular suspension in our cadaveric study measured using CT scans. 
      Further studies are needed to see if this technique can be translated to clinical 
      use in live patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA.

AB  - Cytokine-Induced Killer (CIK) cells share several functional and phenotypical 
      properties of both T and natural killer (NK) cells. They represent an attractive 
      approach for cell-based immunotherapy, as they do not require antigen-specific 
      priming for tumor cell recognition, and can be rapidly expanded in vitro. Their 
      relevant expression of FcgammaRIIIa (CD16a) can be exploited in combination with 
      clinical-grade monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to redirect their lytic activity in 
      an antigen-specific manner. Here, we report the efficacy of this combined 
      approach against triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive tumor that 
      still requires therapeutic options. Different primitive and metastatic TNBC 
      cancer mouse models were established in NSG mice, either by implanting 
      patient-derived TNBC samples or injecting MDA-MB-231 cells orthotopically or 
      intravenously. The combined treatment consisted in the repeated intratumoral or 
      intravenous injection of CIK cells and cetuximab. Tumor growth and metastasis 
      were monitored by bioluminescence or immunohistochemistry, and survival was 
      recorded. CIK cells plus cetuximab significantly restrained primitive tumor 
      growth in mice, either in patient-derived tumor xenografts or MDA-MB-231 cell 
      line models. Moreover, this approach almost completely abolished metastasis 
      spreading and dramatically improved survival. The antigen-specific mAb favored 
      tumor and metastasis tissue infiltration by CIK cells, and led to an enrichment 
      of the CD16a(+) subset.Data highlight the potentiality of this novel 
      immunotherapy strategy where a nonspecific cytotoxic cell population can be 
      converted into tumor-specific effectors with clinical-grade antibodies, thus 
      providing not only a therapeutic option for TNBC but also a valid alternative to 
      more complex approaches based on chimeric antigen receptor-engineered cells. LIST

AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to explore genetic findings and the 
      phenotype in Polish patients with Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD). MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated mutations in the cystatin B (CSTB) gene 
      and clinical presentation in a cohort of patients with ULD. The study population 
      consisted of 19 (14 males) patients with genetically confirmed disease. RESULTS: 
      Sixteen patients were homozygous for the expanded dodecamer repeat mutation 
      alleles, one subject was compound heterozygous for the dodecamer repeat expansion 
      and other mutation, in two, the type of mutation has not yet been established. 
      The numbers of repeats in the CSTB gene varied from 60 to 81. Clinical 
      information was available for 16 subjects. The disease course was progressive in 
      all patients, leading to severe disability, mainly due to myoclonus, in nine. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Genetic findings and the clinical picture 
      of our patients with ULD were in accordance with available studies. The most 
      common genetic defect underlying ULD was homozygosity for an unstable expansion 
      of a dodecamer repeat in the CSTB gene. Patients with action or/and stimulus 
      sensitive myoclonus or intractable myoclonus epilepsy, especially with onset in 
      late childhood/adolescence should be screened for ULD.

TI  - Pathogenic SREK1 decrease in Huntington's disease lowers TAF1 mimicking X-linked 
      dystonia parkinsonism.
PG  - 2207-2219
LID - 10.1093/brain/awaa150 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease and X-linked dystonia parkinsonism are two monogenic basal 
      ganglia model diseases. Huntington's disease is caused by a 
      polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene leading 
      to several toxic interactions of both the expanded CAG-containing mRNA and the 
      polyglutamine-containing protein, while X-linked dystonia parkinsonism is caused 
      by a retrotransposon insertion in the TAF1 gene, which decreases expression of 
      this core scaffold of the basal transcription factor complex TFIID. SRSF6 is an 
      RNA-binding protein of the serine and arginine-rich (SR) protein family that 
      interacts with expanded CAG mRNA and is sequestered into the characteristic 
      polyglutamine-containing inclusion bodies of Huntington's disease brains. Here we 
      report decreased levels of the SRSF6 interactor and regulator SREK1-another SR 
      protein involved in RNA processing-which includes TAF1 as one of its targets. 
      This led us to hypothesize that Huntington's disease and X-linked dystonia 
      parkinsonism pathogeneses converge in TAF1 alteration. We show that diminishing 
      SRSF6 through RNA interference in human neuroblastoma cells leads to a decrease 
      in SREK1 levels, which, in turn, suffices to cause diminished TAF1 levels. We 
      also observed decreased SREK1 and TAF1 levels in striatum of Huntington's disease 
      patients and transgenic model mice. We then generated mice with neuronal 
      transgenic expression of SREK1 (TgSREK1 mice) that, interestingly, showed 
      transcriptomic alterations complementary to those in Huntington's disease mice. 
      Most importantly, by combining Huntington's disease and TgSREK1 mice we verify 
      that SREK1 overexpression corrects TAF1 deficiency and attenuates striatal 
      atrophy and motor phenotype of Huntington's disease mice. Our results therefore 
      demonstrate that altered RNA processing upon SREK1 dysregulation plays a key role 
      in Huntington's disease pathogenesis and pinpoint TAF1 as a likely general 
      determinant of selective vulnerability of the striatum in multiple neurological 
      disorders.

TI  - ABO blood type compatibility is not a risk factor for gestational trophoblastic 
      neoplasia development from androgenetic complete hydatidiform moles.
PG  - e13237

AB  - PROBLEM: Complete hydatidiform moles (CHMs) are allografts to patients in terms 
      of an androgenetic origin. Thus, some immunological reactions may be involved in 
      the development of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) from CHMs. This 
      study aimed to evaluate the effect of ABO blood group on the prognosis of 
      androgenetic CHMs. METHOD OF STUDY: A total of 129 patients who were diagnosed as 
      having CHMs based on multiplex short tandem repeat polymorphism analysis were 
      included. The ABO blood types of molar tissues were determined by 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the ABO gene using a high-resolution melting 
      assay. The incidence of GTN was compared based on ABO compatibility between the 
      patients and their molar tissues. RESULTS: The overall incidence of GTN was 17.1% 
      (22/129). Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia occurred in 10.8% (4/37), 14.8% 
      (8/54), 22.2% (6/27), and 36.4% (4/11) of type O, A, B, and AB patients, 
      respectively. Type AB patients tended to develop GTN compared with other blood 
      type patients (P = .093). In ABO type of CHMs, GTN occurrence was not 
      significantly different as it was 16.4% (10/64), 16.0% (8/50), and 22.2% (4/18) 
      for types O, A, and B, respectively (P = .854). According to the ABO 
      incompatibility between patients and molar tissues, GTN occurred in 19.1% (18/94) 
      of the compatible cases and 11.4% (4/35) of the incompatible cases; the 
      occurrence was not significantly different (P = .223). CONCLUSION: Patients with 
      type AB tended to develop GTN. However, ABO compatibility between patients and 
      molar tissues had no relationship with GTN occurrence.

TI  - Endometriotic cell culture contamination and authenticity: a source of bias in in 
      vitro research?
PG  - 364-376
LID - 10.1093/humrep/dez266 [doi]
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Are the primary cell cultures and cell lines used in 
      endometriosis research of sufficient quality? SUMMARY ANSWER: Primary cells used 
      in endometriosis research lack purity and phenotypic characterisation, and cell 
      lines are not genotypically authenticated. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The poor 
      reproducibility of in vitro research and the lack of authenticity of the cell 
      lines used represent reasons of concern in the field of reproductive biology and 
      endometriosis research. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: In the present study, past 
      in vitro research in the field of endometriosis was systematically reviewed to 
      determine whether the appropriate quality controls were considered. In addition, 
      we explored the performance of Paired Box 2 (Pax2) as an endometrium specific 
      marker in endometrial and endometriotic primary cell cultures; we also 
      characterised the most diffused endometriosis cell lines with respect to 
      important markers including the short tandem repeat (STR) profile. 
      PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Literature review part: almost 300 
      published protocols describing the isolation and creation of primary cell 
      cultures from endometriosis were reviewed. Wet-lab part: primary cells isolated 
      from 13 endometriosis patients were analysed by immunohistochemistry, 
      immunofluorescence and FACS for the expression of Pax2. Cell lines Z11 and Z12, 
      the most diffused endometriosis cell lines, were characterised with respect to 
      the expression of Pax2, steroid hormone receptors and STR profile. MAIN RESULTS 
      AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: From the literature review work, we underscored the lack 
      of sufficient cell purity and phenotypic characterisation of primary cell 
      cultures, which present high risk of contaminations from surrounding 
      non-endometriotic tissues. Past work based on the use of cell lines was reviewed 
      as well, and it emerged that cell line authentication was never performed.In an 
      effort to address these weaknesses for future research, we present data on the 
      performance of Pax2, a suitable marker to exclude ovarian (and other 
      non-endometrial) cell contaminations from primary cell cultures; STR profiles of 
      cell lines Z11 and Z12 were analysed and indicated that the cells were authentic. 
      These profiles are now available for authentication purposes to researchers 
      wishing to perform experiments with these cells.A quality control pipeline to 
      assure sufficient quality of in vitro research in the field of reproductive 
      biology and endometriosis is proposed. We encourage scientists, research 
      institutes, journal reviewers, editors and funding bodies to raise awareness of 
      the problem and adopt appropriate policies to solve it in the future. LARGE-SCALE 
      DATA: STR profiles of cell lines Z11 and Z12 are deposited at the Cellosaurus 
      database-web.expasy.org. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: There may be 
      additional markers suitable to assess cell quality. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE 
      FINDINGS: Future in vitro research in endometriosis and the reliability of 
      outcomes can be improved by using the recommendations presented in this study. 
      STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The study was partly financed by the 
      'Stichting Fertility Foundation' (The Netherlands). The authors declare no 
      existing conflict of interest. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Non-applicable.

TI  - Pediatric Tissue Expansion: Predictors of Premature Expander Removal in a Single 
      Surgeon's Experience with 472 Expanders.
PG  - 755-762
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000006550 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tissue expansion is used for soft-tissue reconstruction in pediatric 
      patients. The expansion process can be complicated by infection and extrusion, 
      leading to premature expander removal. The aim of this study was to identify risk 
      factors associated with premature expander removal caused by infection or 
      extrusion in pediatric patients. METHODS: A retrospective study of pediatric 
      patients who underwent tissue expansion performed by the senior author (R.J.R.) 
      over a 12-year period was performed. Predictor variables included age, sex, race, 
      indication, anatomical location, number of expanders, serial expansion, and 
      expander size. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify 
      risk factors for premature expander removal. RESULTS: A total of 139 patients 
      with 472 expanders were included in this study. Complications occurred with 78 
      expanders (16.5 percent). Premature expander removal caused by infection or 
      exposure occurred with 51 expanders (10.8 percent). In terms of location, the 
      highest rates of premature removal occurred in the lower extremity (20.0 percent) 
      and scalp (16.3 percent). Multivariate analysis identified younger age (0 to 6 
      years compared with 13 to 17 years; OR, 3.98; 95 percent CI, 1.13 to 14.08; p = 
      0.03), greater number of expanders (OR, 1.45; 95 percent CI, 1.03 to 2.03; p = 
      0.03), and lower extremity location (OR, 4.27; 95 percent CI, 1.45 to 12.53; p = 
      0.008) were associated with an increased odds of premature expander removal. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Expander removal occurred in approximately 10 percent of tissue 
      expanders. Odds of premature removal is increased with younger age, greater 
      number of expanders, and lower extremity location. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: Risk, III.

TI  - Isoform-specific involvement of Brpf1 in expansion of adult hematopoietic stem 
      and progenitor cells.
PG  - 359-371
LID - 10.1093/jmcb/mjz092 [doi]
AB  - Bromodomain-containing proteins are known readers of histone acetylation that 
      regulate chromatin structure and transcription. Although the functions of 
      bromodomain-containing proteins in development, homeostasis, and disease states 
      have been well studied, their role in self-renewal of hematopoietic stem and 
      progenitor cells (HSPCs) remains poorly understood. Here, we performed a chemical 
      screen using nine bromodomain inhibitors and found that the bromodomain and PHD 
      finger-containing protein 1 (Brpf1) inhibitor OF-1 enhanced the expansion of 
      Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit+ HSPCs ex vivo without skewing their lineage differentiation 
      potential. Importantly, our results also revealed distinct functions of Brpf1 
      isoforms in HSPCs. Brpf1b promoted the expansion of HSPCs. By contrast, Brpf1a is 
      the most abundant isoform in adult HSPCs but enhanced HSPC quiescence and 
      decreased the HSPC expansion. Furthermore, inhibition of Brpf1a by OF-1 promoted 
      histone acetylation and chromatin accessibility leading to increased expression 
      of self-renewal-related genes (e.g. Mn1). The phenotypes produced by OF-1 
      treatment can be rescued by suppression of Mn1 in HSPCs. Our findings demonstrate 
      that this novel bromodomain inhibitor OF-1 can promote the clinical application 
      of HSPCs in transplantation.

TI  - Noninvasive Prenatal Diagnostics: Recent Developments Using Circulating Fetal 
      Nucleated Cells.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to highlight recent research 
      advances in noninvasive prenatal diagnostic methods. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent 
      studies developing noninvasive prenatal diagnostic (NIPD) methods have been 
      focused on either fetal nucleated red blood cells (fNRBCs) or circulating 
      trophoblasts (cTBs). Enriched cTBs were successfully utilized for whole genome 
      profiling and short tandem repeat (STR) identification to confirm feto-maternal 
      relationship. However, further analysis of isolated fNRBCs remains confined to 
      examining fetal cytogenetics. SUMMARY: Invasive prenatal diagnostic procedures, 
      amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, are the gold standard for the 
      diagnosis of fetal chromosomal abnormalities and genetic disorders. Meanwhile, 
      noninvasive techniques of analyzing circulating cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) have 
      been limited to screening tools and are highly fragmented and confounded by 
      maternal DNA. By detecting circulating fetal nucleated cells (CFNCs) we are able 
      to noninvasively confirm fetal chromosomal abnormalities, truly realizing the 
      concept of "noninvasive prenatal diagnostics". The primary technical challenge is 
      the enrichment of the low abundance of CFNCs in maternal peripheral blood. For 
      any cell-based NIPD method, both fetal whole genome profiling and confirmation of 
      the feto-parental relationship are essential. This has been successfully 
      performed using enriched and isolated cTBs, making cTB a better candidate for 
      NIPD. cTB enumeration also correlates with abnormal fetal or placental 
      development. On the other hand, downstream analysis of fNRBCs remains limited to 
      examining fetal sex and aneuploidies. Furthermore, trophoblast-based NIPD via an 
      endocervical sample is also promising because of reduced dilution from 
      hematologic cells.

TI  - Lifting the burden: State Medicaid expansion reduces financial risk for the 
      injured.
PG  - 51-58
LID - 10.1097/TA.0000000000002493 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Injuries are unanticipated and can be expensive to treat. Patients 
      without sufficient health insurance are at risk for financial strain because of 
      high out-of-pocket (OOP) health care costs relative to their income. We 
      hypothesized that the 2014 Medicaid expansion (ME) in Washington (WA) state, 
      which extended coverage to more than 600,000 WA residents, was associated with a 
      reduction in financial risk among trauma patients. METHODS: We analyzed all 
      trauma patients aged 18 to 64 years admitted to the sole level 1 trauma center in 
      WA from 2012 to 2017. We defined 2012 to 2013 as the prepolicy period and 2014 to 
      2017 as the postpolicy period. We used a multivariable linear regression model to 
      evaluate for changes in length of stay, inpatient mortality, and discharge 
      disposition. To evaluate for financial strain, we used WA state and US census 
      data to estimate postsubsistence income and OOP expenses for our sample and then 
      applied these two estimates to determine catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) 
      risk as defined by the World Health Organization (OOP health expenses >/=40% of 
      estimated household postsubsistence income). RESULTS: A total of 16,801 trauma 
      patients were included. After ME, the Medicaid coverage rate increased from 20.4% 
      to 41.0%, and the uninsured rate decreased from 19.2% to 3.7% (p < 0.001 for 
      both). There was no significant change in private insurance coverage. Medicaid 
      expansion was not associated with significant changes in clinical outcomes or 
      discharge disposition. Estimated CHE risk by payer was 81.4% for the uninsured, 
      25.9% for private insurance, and less than 0.1% for Medicaid. After ME, the risk 
      of CHE for the policy-eligible sample fell from 26.4% to 14.0% (p < 0.01). 
      CONCLUSION: State ME led to an 80% reduction in the uninsured rate among patients 
      admitted for injury, with an associated large reduction in the risk of CHE. 
      However, privately insured patients were not fully protected from CHE. Additional 
      research is needed to evaluate the impact of these policies on the financial 
      viability of trauma centers. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic analysis, level II.

TI  - The impact of Medicaid expansion on trauma-related emergency department 
      utilization: A national evaluation of policy implications.
PG  - 59-69
LID - 10.1097/TA.0000000000002504 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of the 2014 Affordable Care Act (ACA) upon national 
      trauma-related emergency department (ED) utilization is unknown. We assessed 
      ACA-related changes in ED use and payer mix, hypothesizing that post-ACA ED 
      visits would decline and Medicaid coverage would increase disproportionately in 
      regions of widespread policy adoption. METHODS: We queried the National Emergency 
      Department Sample (NEDS) for those with a primary trauma diagnosis, aged 18 to 
      64. Comparing pre-ACA (2012) to post-ACA (10/2014 to 09/2015), primary outcomes 
      were change in ED visits and payer status; secondary outcomes were change in 
      costs, discharge disposition and inpatient length of stay. Univariate and 
      multivariate analyses were performed, including difference-in-differences 
      analyses. We compared changes in ED trauma visits by payer in the West (91% in a 
      Medicaid expansion state) versus the South (12%). RESULTS: Among 21.2 million 
      trauma-related ED visits, there was a 13.3% decrease post-ACA. Overall, there was 
      a 7.2% decrease in uninsured ED visits (25.5% vs. 18.3%, p < 0.001) and a 6.6% 
      increase in Medicaid coverage (17.6% vs. 24.2%, p < 0.001). Trauma patients had 
      40% increased odds of having Medicaid post-ACA (vs. pre-ACA: aOR 1.40, p < 
      0.001). Patients in the West had 31% greater odds of having Medicaid (vs. South: 
      aOR 1.31, p < 0.001). The post-ACA increase in Medicaid was greater in the West 
      (vs. South: aOR 1.60, p < 0.001). Post-ACA, inpatients were more likely to have 
      Medicaid (vs. ED discharge: aOR 1.20, p < 0.001) and there was a 25% increase in 
      inpatient discharge to rehabilitation (aOR 1.24, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: 
      Post-ACA, there was a significant increase in insured trauma patients and a 
      decrease in injury-related ED visits, possibly resulting from access to other 
      outpatient services. Ensuring sustainability of expanded coverage will benefit 
      injured patients and trauma systems. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic, level III.

TI  - The Effect of Expansion Thoracostomy on Spine Growth in Patients with Spinal 
      Deformity and Fused Ribs Treated with Rib-Based Growing Constructs.

LID - S2212-134X(19)30018-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jspd.2019.01.004 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of prospective registries. OBJECTIVES: We 
      hypothesized that patients with congenitally fused ribs who underwent 
      thoracostomy upon implantation of rib-based distraction devices would achieve 
      improved spine growth compared with those who did not undergo thoracostomy. 
      SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Patients with fused ribs may develop thoracic 
      insufficiency syndrome. Treatment for severe early-onset spinal deformity with 
      rib fusions often includes the placement of rib-based expansion devices with 
      surgical division of the fused ribs (thoracostomy). The effect of thoracostomy on 
      spinal growth has not been fully examined. METHODS: Two multicenter registries of 
      primarily prospectively collected data were searched. Patients with fused ribs 
      and implantation of a rib-based device were identified. A total of 151 patients 
      with rib fusions treated with rib-based constructs and minimum two-year follow-up 
      were included. Among those, 103 patients were treated with expansion thoracostomy 
      at the time of implantation, whereas 48 patients received device implantation 
      alone. We evaluated change in T1-T12 and T1-S1 height, coronal Cobb angle, 
      kyphosis, and number of surgeries. Preoperative deformity was similar between the 
      two groups. Only 19% of patient underwent final fusion, with similar numbers 
      fused in each group. RESULTS: At latest follow-up, the expansion thoracostomy 
      group had a greater total improvement in T1-S1 height (7.2 cm vs. 4.8 cm, 
      p = .004). There was no difference between the two groups for change in spinal 
      height at each lengthening procedure. Interestingly, thoracostomy patients also 
      underwent more total surgeries (11.5 vs. 9.6, p = .031) and more lengthening 
      procedures (8.3 vs. 6.6, p = .017) than the comparison group despite similar 
      length of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent expansion thoracostomy 
      at the time of rib expansion device implantation achieved greater improvement in 
      T1-S1 height than those who underwent implantation of rib expansion device alone. 
      Further work is needed to evaluate whether expansion thoracostomy impacts 
      pulmonary function.

TI  - Reducing Expansion Visits in Immediate Implant-Based Breast Reconstruction: A 
      Comparative Study of Prepectoral and Subpectoral Expander Placement.
PG  - 276-286
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000005791 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The numerous office visits required to complete expansion in 
      implant-based breast reconstruction impact patient satisfaction, office 
      resources, and time to complete reconstruction. This study aimed to determine 
      whether prepectoral compared to subpectoral immediate implant-based breast 
      reconstruction offers expedited tissue expansion without affecting complication 
      rates. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent immediate implant-based breast 
      reconstruction with tissue expanders from January of 2016 to July of 2017 by a 
      single surgeon were grouped into subpectoral (partial submuscular/partial 
      acellular dermal matrix) or prepectoral (complete acellular dermal matrix 
      coverage), and reviewed. The primary outcomes were total days and number of 
      visits to complete expansion. Groups were compared by univariate analysis with 
      significance set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: In total, 101 patients (subpectoral, n = 
      69; prepectoral, n = 32) underwent 184 immediate implant-based breast 
      reconstructions (subpectoral, n = 124; prepectoral, n = 60). There was no 
      difference in age, body mass index, smoking, or diabetes between the groups (all 
      p > 0.05). Follow-up was similar between groups (179.3 +/- 98.2 days versus 218.3 +/- 
      119.8 days; p = 0.115). Prepectoral patients took fewer days to complete 
      expansion (40.4 +/- 37.8 days versus 62.5 +/- 50.2 days; p < 0.001) and fewer office 
      visits to complete expansion (2.3 +/- 1 .7 versus 3.9 +/- 1.8; p < 0.001), and were 
      expanded to greater final volumes than subpectoral patients (543.7 +/- 122.9 ml 
      versus 477.5 +/- 159.6 ml; p = 0.017). Between prepectoral and subpectoral 
      reconstructions, there were similar rates of minor complications (25 percent 
      versus 18.5 percent; p = 0.311), readmissions (5 percent versus 2.4 percent; p = 
      0.393), seromas (8.3 percent versus 5.6 percent; p = 0.489), reoperations for 
      hematoma (3.3 percent versus 1.6 percent; p = 0.597), and explantations (5 
      percent versus 2.4 percent; p = 0.393). CONCLUSION: This novel analysis 
      demonstrates that prepectoral immediate implant-based breast reconstruction can 
      facilitate expansion to higher total volumes in nearly half the office visits 
      compared to subpectoral placement in similar populations without increasing 
      complication rates. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III.

TI  - Medial meniscus posterior root tear causes swelling of the medial meniscus and 
      expansion of the extruded meniscus: a comparative analysis between 2D and 3D MRI.
PG  - 3405-3415
LID - 10.1007/s00167-019-05580-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to clarify the advantages of three-dimensional (3D) 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over two-dimensional (2D) MRI in measuring the 
      size of the medial meniscus (MM) and to analyse the volumes of MM and the 
      extruded meniscus in patients with MM posterior root tear (MMPRT), at 10 degrees  and 90 degrees  
      knee flexion. METHODS: This study included 17 patients with MMPRTs and 15 
      volunteers with uninjured knees. The MMs were manually segmented for 3D 
      reconstruction; thereafter, the extruded part separated from the tibial edge was 
      determined. The length, width, height, and extrusion of MM were measured by the 
      2D and 3D methods, and compared. The MM volume, extruded meniscus volume, and 
      their ratio were also calculated using 3D analysis software in the two groups. 
      RESULTS: The estimated length and posterior height of MM were larger with 3D MRI 
      than with 2D MRI measurements. The MM volume was significantly greater in MMPRT 
      knees than in normal knees, with increasing MM height. In MMPRT knees, the mean 
      volume of the extruded meniscus and its ratio significantly increased by 
      304 mm(3) (p = 0.02) and 9.1% (p < 0.01), respectively, during knee flexion. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that 3D MRI could estimate the precise MM 
      size and that MMPRT caused swelling of the meniscus due to the increased 
      thickness in the posteromedial part. The clinical significance of this study lies 
      in its 3D evaluation of MM volume, which should help the surgeon understand the 
      biomechanical failure of MM function and improve MMPRT repair technique. LEVEL OF

AB  - OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: To compare the functional outcomes and complication rates 
      in patients who underwent expansion sphincter pharyngoplasty with anterior 
      palatoplasty (ESPwAP) versus barbed pharyngoplasty (BP). STUDY DESIGN: 
      Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: A medical database was used to retrieve the 
      records of 129 patients who had an isolated palatoplasty surgery between January 
      2014 and July 2018. Patients who had mild or moderate obstructive sleep apnea 
      without a history of revision surgery and underwent ESPwAP or BP in addition to 
      traditional tonsillectomy were included in the study. Pre- and postoperative 
      polysomnography and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was evaluated in the patients 
      who completed at least a 6-month follow-up period. RESULTS: Forty-five and 53 
      patients met the inclusion, and were comprised of BP and ESPwAP groups, 
      respectively. ESPwAP and BP significantly improved mean apnea hypopnea index 
      (AHI) from 28.5 to 9.1 (P = .000) and 25.9 to 7.4 (P = .000), respectively. No 
      significant statistical difference was found between the mean AHI scores of two 
      groups. Selecting a threshold of a 50% reduction in AHI and AHI less than 20 
      events/h, success rates were 86.6% in BP group and 84.9% in ESPwAP group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that both types of surgeries are effective with 
      comparable results. The BP technique may be preferred when possible to avoid soft 
      tissue excision and seems to be a less invasive procedure with a similar success 
      rate when compared to ESPwAP. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 130:E275-E279,

AB  - Relaxin (RLN) is an insulin-like peptide hormone that enables softening and 
      lengthening of the pubic symphysis and uterine cervix. Here, we analyzed the 
      effects of RLN2 on the expansion of rat midpalatal suture (MPS) using a 
      magnetically directed liposome-based drug delivery system. Thirty-six male rats 
      were divided into three groups: control (MPS was not expanded), lipo (expanded 
      for 1...week with vehicle liposomes encapsulating ferric oxide and Cy5.5), and 
      RLN-lipo (expanded for 1...week with the liposomes coated with RLN2). Rats were 
      sacrificed after 1...week of expansion or after 2...weeks of retention. To accumulate 
      RLN2-liposomes, a magnetic sheet was fixed to the palatal mucosa of the MPS. In 
      vivo imaging showed magnetically controlled accumulation of liposomes in the MPS 
      for 72...h. Immunohistochemistry revealed RLN2 expression in the MPS after 
      expansion and relaxin receptor (RXFP) 2 expression at the osteogenic front (OF) 
      in the RLN-lipo group; all groups expressed RXFP1 in the MPS. MPS expansion and 
      bone formation were significantly accelerated at the OF in RLN-lipo group 
      compared with the other groups. In the RLN-lipo group, significantly accelerated 
      serrate bone deposition and elevated periostin (POSTN), iNOS, and MMP-1 levels 
      were observed in the MPS. Sclerostin (SOST) expression was significantly reduced 
      in newly formed bone in the RLN-lipo group. Our data revealed that RLN2 enhanced 
      suture expansion via MMP-1 and iNOS secretion in the sutural fibroblasts and new 
      bone formation via POSTN expression in osteoblasts at the OF. These properties 
      may be useful for developing a new less-invasive orthopedic treatment aiming at 
      sutural modification of cranio- and maxillofacial deformity patients.

TI  - Factors influencing the clinical outcome of preimplantation genetic testing for 
      polycystic kidney disease.
PG  - 949-958
LID - 10.1093/humrep/dez027 [doi]
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: What are the factors influencing the success rate for couples 
      undergoing preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) for polycystic kidney disease 
      (PKD)? SUMMARY ANSWER: In our study cohort, the live birth delivery rate is 
      significantly associated with female age while the male infertility accompanying 
      autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD) does not substantially affect the clinical 
      outcome. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: While women with ADPKD have no specific fertility 
      problems, male ADPKD patients may present with reproductive system abnormalities 
      and infertility. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This retrospective cohort study 
      involves 91 PGT cycles for PKD for 43 couples (33 couples for PKD1, 2 couples for 
      PKD2 and 8 couples for autosomal recessive PKD (ARPKD)) from January 2005 until 
      December 2016 with follow-up of transfers until end of 2017. 
      PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Sixteen single-cell clinical tests for 
      PKD based on multiplex PCR of short tandem repeat markers, with or without a 
      specific mutation were developed and applied for diagnosis of 584 Day 3 cleavage 
      stage embryos. In 18 couples, the male partner was affected with ADPKD (=Group A) 
      and 12 of them had a documented infertility status. Group A underwent 52 cycles 
      to oocyte retrieval. For 18 other couples, the female partner was affected with 
      ADPKD (=Group B) and four male partners from this group had a documented history 
      of infertility. This group underwent 31 cycles to OR. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE 
      OF CHANCE: Genetic analysis resulted in 545 embryos (93.3%) with a diagnosis, of 
      which 215 (36.8%) were genetically transferable. Transfer of 74 embryos in 53 
      fresh cycles and of 34 cryopreserved embryos in 33 frozen-warmed embryo transfer 
      cycles resulted in a live birth delivery rate of 38.4% per transfer with 31 
      singleton live births, two twin live births and one ongoing pregnancy. The 
      observed cumulative delivery rate was 57.8% per couple after five treatment 
      cycles. Thirty cryopreserved embryos still remain available for transfer. The 
      clinical pregnancy rate per transfer (fresh + frozen; 45.9% in group A versus 
      60.0% in group B, P < 0.05) and the live birth delivery rate per transfer (fresh 
      + frozen; 27.0% in group A versus 42.9% in group B, P < 0.05) was significantly 
      lower for couples with the male partner affected with ADPKD compared with couples 
      with the female partner affected with ADPKD. However, a multivariate logistic 
      regression analysis showed that only female age was associated with live birth 
      delivery rate (odds ratio = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.77-0.99; P = 0.032). LIMITATIONS, 
      REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study is based on retrospective data from a single 
      centre with Day 3 one-cell and two-cell biopsy. Further analysis of a larger 
      cohort of PKD patients undergoing PGT is required to determine the impact of male 
      infertility associated with ADPKD on the cumulative results. WIDER IMPLICATIONS 
      OF THE FINDINGS: Knowledge about factors affecting the clinical outcome after PGT 
      can be a valuable tool for physicians to counsel PKD patients about their 
      reproductive options. Males affected with ADPKD who suffer from infertility 
      should be advised to seek treatment in time to improve their chances of 
      conceiving a child. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): No funding was obtained. 
      There are no competing interests to declare. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Not 
      applicable.

TI  - Clinical manifestations of homozygote allele carriers in Huntington disease.
PG  - e2101-e2108
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000007147 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Because patients homozygous for Huntington disease (HD) receive the 
      gain-of-function mutation in a double dose, one would expect a more toxic effect 
      in homozygotes than in heterozygotes. Our aim was to investigate the phenotypic 
      differences between homozygotes with both alleles >/=36 CAG repeats and 
      heterozygotes with 1 allele >/=36 CAG repeats. METHODS: This was an international, 
      longitudinal, case-control study (European Huntington's Disease Network Registry 
      database). Baseline and longitudinal total functional capacity, motor, cognitive, 
      and behavioral scores of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) 
      were compared between homozygotes and heterozygotes. Four-year follow-up data 
      were analyzed using longitudinal mixed-effects models. To estimate the 
      association of age at onset with the length of the shorter and larger allele in 
      homozygotes and heterozygotes, regression analysis was applied. RESULTS: Of 
      10,921 participants with HD (5,777 female [52.9%] and 5,138 male [47.0%]) with a 
      mean age of 55.1 +/- 14.1 years, 28 homozygotes (0.3%) and 10,893 (99.7%) 
      heterozygotes were identified. After correcting for multiple comparisons, 
      homozygotes and heterozygotes had similar age at onset and UHDRS scores and 
      disease progression. In the multivariate linear regression analysis, the longer 
      allele was the most contributing factor to decreased age at HD onset in the 
      homozygotes (p < 0.0001) and heterozygotes (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: CAG repeat 
      expansion on both alleles of the HTT gene is infrequent. Age at onset, HD 
      phenotype, and disease progression do not significantly differ between 
      homozygotes and heterozygotes, indicating similar effect on the mutant protein. 
      CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that age at 
      onset, the motor phenotype and rate of motor decline, and symptoms and signs 
      progression is similar in homozygotes compared to heterozygotes.

TI  - Impact of Affordable Care Act-related insurance expansion policies on mortality 
      and access to post-discharge care for trauma patients: an analysis of the 
      National Trauma Data Bank.
PG  - 196-205
LID - 10.1097/TA.0000000000002117 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uninsured trauma patients have worse outcomes and worse access to 
      post-discharge care that is critically important for recovery after injury. 
      Little is known regarding the impact of the insurance coverage expansion policies 
      of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), most notably state-level Medicaid expansion, on 
      trauma patients. In this study, we examine the national impact of these policies 
      on payer mix, inpatient mortality, and access to post-acute care for trauma 
      patients. METHODS: We used the 2011-2016 National Trauma Data Bank to evaluate 
      for changes in insurance coverage among trauma patients 18-64 years old. Our 
      pre-/post-expansion models defined 2011-2013 as the pre-policy period, 2015-2016 
      as the post-policy period, and 2014 as a washout year. To evaluate for 
      policy-associated changes in inpatient mortality and discharge disposition among 
      the policy-eligible sample, we leveraged multivariable linear regression 
      techniques to adjust for year-to-year variation in patient demographics, injury 
      characteristics, and facility traits. We then examined the relationship between 
      the magnitude of facility-level reductions in uninsured patients and access to 
      post-acute care after policy implementation. RESULTS: We identified 1,656,469 
      patients meeting inclusion criteria between 2011 and 2016. The pre-policy 
      uninsured rate of 23.4% fell by 5.9 percentage-points after coverage expansion (p 
      < 0.001), with a corresponding 7.5 percentage-point increase in Medicaid coverage 
      (p < 0.001). After policy implementation, there were no significant changes in 
      inpatient mortality. However, there was a >30% relative increase in discharge to 
      a post-acute care facility and a similar increase in discharge with home health 
      services (p < 0.001 for both). The greatest gains in access to post-acute 
      services were seen among facilities with the greatest reductions in their 
      uninsured rate (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: ACA-related coverage expansion policies, 
      most notably Medicaid expansion, were associated with a >25% reduction in the 
      uninsured rate among non-elderly adult trauma patients. Although no immediate 
      impact on inpatient mortality was seen, insurance coverage expansion was 
      associated with a higher proportion of patients receiving critically important 
      post-discharge care. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Epidemiological, level III.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Tissue expansion complication rates up to 40% have been 
      reported in the pediatric population. This study aims to review one Canadian 
      pediatric plastic surgeon's experience with tissue expansion by examining tissue 
      expander and flap complication rates, and discussing important aspects of the 
      tissue expansion experience. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of the 
      medical records of all tissue expansion patients treated by the senior author 
      during a ten-year period. Data were collected on patient demographics, tissue 
      expansion details, complications, and outcomes, and were analyzed descriptively. 
      The relationship between tissue expander complications and flap complications was 
      analyzed with odds ratio. RESULTS: Ninety-three expanders were placed in 24 
      patients during 49 sessions. Complications occurred in 19 expanders (10 patients; 
      16 sessions), resulting in premature removal of nine. Only one session was 
      unsuccessful; the expander became exposed and was removed after 1 month. The odds 
      of having a flap complication were three times greater with preceding tissue 
      expander complication (not statistically significant). CONCLUSIONS: Our study 
      identifies a 20% expander complication rate in the pediatric population. Patients 
      with tissue expander complications subsequently experienced more flap 
      complications than those without tissue expander complications. Complications do 
      not preclude successful reconstruction. TYPE OF STUDY: Prognostic. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: II.

AB  - The potato phytopathogen Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus (Cms) is a 
      causative agent of bacterial ring rot, which is a serious threat to crops. In EU 
      member countries, Cms is subject to quarantine and has to be combated. The 
      knowledge about the transmission of C. michiganensis strains is limited due to a 
      lack of methods which could be used for epidemiological analysis. In this study, 
      PCR melting profile (PCR MP) and variable number tandem repeat methods were used 
      in Cms epidemiological analysis for the first time. PCR MP was based on the 
      melting temperature analysis of BamHI restriction fragments of chromosomal DNA. 
      Respectively, for the variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) method, six loci were 
      identified and used in the differentiation of Cms isolates. PCR MP was used for 
      93 Cms isolated in Poland. Both PCR MP and VNTR methods were used for the 
      differentiation of 47 Cms strains in this collection. Both these methods were 
      found to be useful for the epidemiological analysis of Cms. SIGNIFICANCE AND 
      IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The potato phytopathogen, Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. 
      sepedonicus (Cms), is a serious threat to crops and lead to significant economic 
      losses. The only way to control and eliminate the disease caused by this pathogen 
      is the use of certified seed potato and strict quarantine of infected fields. 
      Here, for the first time, two molecular typing methods (PCR melting profile (PCR 
      MP) and variable number tandem repeat (VNTR)) were evaluated in respect of their 
      potential in differentiation of Cms isolates. As a result, we obtained 
      characteristic profiles of DNA fragments (PCR MP) and numeric patterns (VNTR), 
      which enable the intraspecies genotyping of Cms strains confirming the 
      effectiveness of PCR MP and VNTR methods in differentiation of Cms strains.

TI  - Salvaging the Unavoidable: A Review of Complications in Pediatric Tissue 
      Expansion.
PG  - 759-768
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004650 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tissue expansion, while a mainstay of reconstruction for pediatric 
      cutaneous lesions, has significant complication rates. The authors review the 
      complications in a single-surgeon series of tissue expansion to identify risk 
      factors for complications and guide subsequent therapy so that reconstructive 
      goals in patients can be met irrespective of intervening complications. METHODS: 
      A retrospective chart review was conducted of all pediatric patients who 
      underwent tissue expansion performed by the senior author (A.K.G.) over a 12-year 
      period. In total, 282 expanders were placed in 94 patients. RESULTS: A total of 
      65 complications occurred in 39 of 94 patients (41.5 percent), involving 65 of 
      the 282 expanders (23.0 percent) placed. Major complications that required 
      expander removal included exposure (n = 11), rupture (n = 15), and migration (n = 
      11). The most frequent minor complications, which did not require immediate 
      expander removal, included migration (n = 13) and port malfunction (n = 9). The 
      majority of expanders were placed in the scalp (n = 114), followed by the torso 
      (n = 100), face and neck (n = 52), and the extremities (n = 16). Serial expansion 
      beyond the second round resulted in a marked increase in complications. Despite 
      complications, tissue expansion in the majority of patients could be salvaged, 
      and a satisfactory outcome was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Families must be made aware 
      that approximately one-third of patients may have a complication requiring 
      additional surgery or modification of the initial reconstructive plan. However, 
      these complications need not preclude attainment of reconstructive goals.

TI  - Expansion Thoracoplasty in Rabbit Model: Effect of Timing on Preserving Pulmonary 
      Growth and Correcting Spine Deformity.
PG  - E877-E884
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000002573 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: In a treatment-control animal study expansion thoracoplasty (ET) 
      was performed in a juvenile rabbit model of thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS) 
      and benefits to thoracic development and respiratory function quantified. Rabbits 
      treated early versus late were compared to age-matched normal and disease control 
      rabbits through to skeletal maturity. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate (1) how ET changes the 
      natural TIS disease trajectory and (2) how timing of ET affects changes in spine 
      growth, lung growth, and respiratory mechanics. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: 
      Pulmonary growth potential is thought to diminish with age; thus, early 
      therapeutic intervention may increase pulmonary growth in children with TIS. 
      However, no direct empirical evidence exists to support this treatment paradigm. 
      METHODS: Convex left scoliosis and resultant TIS was induced in 3-week-old 
      rabbits via surgical rib tethering. We compare the efficacy of ET performed at 7 
      weeks and expanded at 11 weeks (early, n = 7) versus only at 11 weeks of age 
      (late, n = 7) in preserving lung growth and respiratory function relative to 
      normal (n = 8) and disease (n = 10) rabbits. Sequential computed tomography 
      images and pulmonary function testing was performed to quantify spine curvature, 
      lung growth, and respiratory volumes. At 28 weeks of age chest wall elastance was 
      measured in vivo then acinar complexity analyzed histologically via radial 
      alveolar counts. RESULTS: ET performed early or late altered the predicted 
      trajectory of spine deformity, pulmonary growth inhibition, and respiratory 
      dysfunction seen in disease rabbits. Growth was not significantly different 
      between early and late rabbits and post-treatment gains remained below those of 
      age-matched normal rabbits. Chest wall elastance was impaired by ET and more so 
      in early rabbits, there were no differences in pulmonary elastance. CONCLUSION: 
      ET interrupted the natural progression of deformity and pulmonary hypoplasia 
      associated with spine curvature in disease rabbits. However, growth benefits are 
      only seen in cases of the most severe initial deformity and must be balanced 
      against the further impairment to chest wall function associated with repetitive 
      surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.

TI  - External Port Tissue Expansion in the Pediatric Population: Confirming Its Safety 
      and Efficacy.
PG  - 883e-890e
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004372 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: External filling ports in tissue expander-based reconstruction have 
      the advantages of being associated with less pain and emotional distress. 
      However, among practicing surgeons using tissue expansion, a theoretical concern 
      remains regarding higher risk of infection. The authors' goal was to evaluate 
      external port safety in the pediatric population by looking at the complications 
      and overall success rate of reconstruction. METHODS: A retrospective review of 
      all patients undergoing tissue expansion using external ports at Children's 
      Hospital Los Angeles between January of 2008 and June of 2016 was conducted. 
      Patient demographic and perioperative data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: 
      Two hundred forty-one expanders were placed in 100 pediatric patients, resulting 
      in 123 procedures for congenital and acquired conditions, with an average age at 
      the time of surgery of 7.1 years (range, 1 month to 19.9 years) and average 
      follow-up length of 2.5 years (range, 2.8 months to 8.8 years). The overall 
      complication rate was 29.9 percent, and the infection rate was 17 percent. The 
      majority of these cases were treated conservatively without additional need for 
      surgery. Of 123 cases, 25 required premature expander removal because of 
      complications. Despite early intervention, 21 of these cases underwent successful 
      completion of their reconstruction according to the preoperative plan, resulting 
      in an overall 96.7 percent success rate of tissue expander reconstruction. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In children, who are often less tolerant of the pain and distress 
      associated with internal port expansion, the authors encourage the use of 
      external ports. This study found a high success rate in terms of successful 
      reconstruction, with the majority of complications being treated conservatively.

AB  - Human pluripotent stem cell derived neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) have the 
      unique properties of long-term in vitro expansion as well as differentiation into 
      the various neurons and supporting cell types of the central nervous system 
      (CNS). Because of these characteristics, hNPCs have tremendous potential in the 
      modeling and treatment of various CNS diseases and disorders. However, expansion 
      and neuronal differentiation of hNPCs in quantities necessary for these 
      applications is not possible with current two dimensional (2-D) approaches. Here, 
      we used a fully defined peptide substrate as the basis for a microcarrier 
      (MC)-based suspension culture system. Several independently derived hNPC lines 
      were cultured on MCs for multiple passages as well as efficiently differentiated 
      to neurons. Finally, this MC-based system was used in conjunction with a low 
      shear rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor for the integrated, large-scale 
      expansion and neuronal differentiation of hNPCs. Overall, this fully defined and 
      scalable biomanufacturing system will facilitate the generation of hNPCs and 
      their neuronal derivatives in quantities necessary for basic and translational 
      applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In this work, we developed a 
      microcarrier (MC)-based culture system that allows for the expansion and neuronal 
      differentiation of human pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells 
      (hNPCs) under defined conditions. In turn, this MC approach was implemented in a 
      rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor for the large-scale expansion and neuronal 
      differentiation of hNPCs. This work is of significance as it overcomes current 
      limitations of conventional two dimensional (2-D) culture systems to enable the 
      generation of hNPCs and their neuronal derivatives in quantities required for 
      downstream applications in disease modeling, drug screening, and regenerative 
      medicine.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Gleditsia sinensis Lam. (G. sinensis) has been 
      used in Oriental medicine for tumor, thrombosis, inflammation-related disease, 
      and obesity. AIM OF THE STUDY: The pharmacological inhibitory effects of fruits 
      of G. sinensis (GFE) on hyperlipidemia have been reported, but its inhibitory 
      effects on adipogenesis and underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. 
      Herein we evaluated the anti-adipogenic effects of GFE and described the 
      underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of ethanol extracts of 
      GFE on adipocyte differentiation were examined in 3T3-L1 cells using biochemical 
      and molecular analyses. RESULTS: During the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, GFE 
      significantly reduced lipid accumulation and downregulated master adipogenic 
      transcription factors, including CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha and peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, at mRNA and protein levels. These changes led 
      to the suppression of several adipogenic-specific genes and proteins, including 
      fatty acid synthase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, stearoyl-CoA 
      desaturase-1, and acetyl CoA carboxylase. However, the inhibitory effects of GFE 
      on lipogenesis were only shown when GFE is treated in the early stage of 
      adipogenesis within the first two days of differentiation. As a potential 
      mechanism, during the early stages of differentiation, GFE inhibited cell 
      proliferation by a decrease in the expression of DNA synthesis-related proteins 
      and increased p27 expression and suppressed signal transducer and activator of 
      transcription 3 (STAT3) activation induced in a differentiation medium. 
      CONCLUSIONS: GFE inhibits lipogenesis by negative regulation of adipogenic 
      transcription factors, which is associated with GFE-mediated cell cycle arrest 
      and STAT3 inhibition.

TI  - Stent boost enhancement compared to intravascular ultrasound in the evaluation of 
      stent expansion in elective percutaneous coronary interventions.
PG  - 21-26
LID - 10.1016/j.ehj.2017.09.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stent underexpansion is a major risk factor for in-stent restenosis 
      and acute in-stent thrombosis(1)Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is one of the 
      standards for detection of stent underexpansion (de Feyter et al. 1999; Mintz et 
      al., 2001). StentBoost (SB) enhancement allows an improved angiographic 
      visualization of the stent (Koolen et al., 2005). AIM OF WORK: Comparison of 
      stent expansion by IVUS and SB enhancement and detection of value of SB to guide 
      dilatation post stent deployment. METHODOLOGY: IVUS, SB enhancement and QCA were 
      done in 30 patients admitted for elective stenting procedures .We compared 
      measurements of mean +/-standard deviations of (Max SD, Min SD, Mean SD, stent 
      symmetry index) using IVUS, SB and QCA after stent deployment and after 
      postdilatation whenever necessary to optimize stent deployment. The Stent 
      symmetry index was calculated [(maximum stent diameter minus minimum stent 
      diameter) divided by maximum stent diameter]. RESULTS: The Max SD was (3.45 +/- 
      0.62 vs 3.55 +/- 0.56 vs 2.97 +/- 0.59) by IVUS vs SB vs QCA respectively. Max SD was 
      significantly higher by IVUS vs QCA (p .009) and between SB vs QCA (p .001) while 
      there was nonsignificant difference between IVUS vs SB (p .53). The Min SD was 
      (2.77 +/- 0.53 vs 2.58 +/- 0.56 vs 1.88 +/- 0.60) by IVUS vs SB vs QCA respectively. 
      Min SD was significantly higher by IVUS vs QCA (p .001) and between SB vs QCA (p 
      .001) while there was nonsignificant difference between IVUS vs SB (p .07). The 
      stent symmetry index was (0.24 +/-0.09 vs 0.34 +/- 0.09 vs 0.14 +/-0.27) by IVUS vs SB 
      vs QCA respectively. It was significantly higher by IVUS vs QCA (p .001) and 
      between SB vs QCA (p .001) while there was nonsignificant difference between IVUS 
      vs SB (p .32). SB was positively correlated with IVUS measurements of Max SD 
      (p...< .0001 & r 0.74) and Min SD (p...< .0001 & r 0.68). QCA was positively 
      correlated with IVUS measurements of Max SD correlation (p...< .0001 & r 0.69) and 
      Min SD (p...< .0001 & r 0.63). QCA was positively correlated with SB measurements 
      of Max SD (p...< .0001 & r 0.61) and Min SD (p .003 & r 0.49). CONCLUSIONS: 
      StentBoost enhancement has superior correlations for stent expansion measured by 
      IVUS when compared with QCA. SB enhancement improved stent visualization and 
      identification of stent underexpansion to guide stent postdilatation.

TI  - Ultrasound-Guided Carpal Tunnel Release Using Dynamic Expansion of the Transverse 
      Safe Zone in a Patient With Postpolio Syndrome: A Case Report.
PG  - 1115-1118
LID - 10.1016/j.pmrj.2018.02.016 [doi]
AB  - The prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in patients with postpolio 
      syndrome occurs at a rate of 22%. Irrespective of those with CTS, 74% of 
      postpolio patients weight bear through their arms for ambulation or transfers. As 
      open carpal tunnel release is performed along the weight-bearing region of the 
      wrist, their functional independence may be altered while recovering. This case 
      demonstrates that ultrasound-guided carpal tunnel release was successfully 
      performed in a patient with postpolio syndrome allowing him to immediately weight 
      bear through his hands after the procedure so he could recover at home. LEVEL OF

TI  - Disease onset in X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism correlates with expansion of a 
      hexameric repeat within an SVA retrotransposon in TAF1.
PG  - E11020-E11028
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1712526114 [doi]
AB  - X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is a neurodegenerative disease associated 
      with an antisense insertion of a SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA)-type retrotransposon within 
      an intron of TAF1 This unique insertion coincides with six additional noncoding 
      sequence changes in TAF1, the gene that encodes TATA-binding protein-associated 
      factor-1, which appear to be inherited together as an identical haplotype in all 
      reported cases. Here we examined the sequence of this SVA in XDP patients (n = 
      140) and detected polymorphic variation in the length of a hexanucleotide repeat 
      domain, (CCCTCT)(n) The number of repeats in these cases ranged from 35 to 52 and 
      showed a highly significant inverse correlation with age at disease onset. 
      Because other SVAs exhibit intrinsic promoter activity that depends in part on 
      the hexameric domain, we assayed the transcriptional regulatory effects of 
      varying hexameric lengths found in the unique XDP SVA retrotransposon using 
      luciferase reporter constructs. When inserted sense or antisense to the 
      luciferase reading frame, the XDP variants repressed or enhanced transcription, 
      respectively, to an extent that appeared to vary with length of the hexamer. 
      Further in silico analysis of this SVA sequence revealed multiple motifs 
      predicted to form G-quadruplexes, with the greatest potential detected for the 
      hexameric repeat domain. These data directly link sequence variation within the 
      XDP-specific SVA sequence to phenotypic variability in clinical disease 
      manifestation and provide insight into potential mechanisms by which this 
      intronic retroelement may induce transcriptional interference in TAF1 expression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lymphatic malformations (LMs) in the mediastinum are uncommon. 
      However, cervical LMs may expand into the mediastinum. The aim of this study was 
      to review our experience with the management of patients with LMs involving the 
      mediastinum and to propose a treatment algorithm to guide the management of these 
      rare malformations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a descriptive retrospective 
      chart review of all patients with LMs involving the mediastinum treated at our 
      Institution between 2009 and 2015. We collected demographic data, data on 
      investigations, management, and complications of the treatment, as well as 
      outcomes at follow-up. Complications were defined and described according to the 
      Clavien-Dindo classification. The clinical outcome was assessed using a clinical 
      assessment scale. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of seven patients. Airway 
      compromise at the time of diagnosis was seen in 4 patients. Three patients had 
      anatomical compression of the trachea and two patients had sub-total compression 
      of the right lung. All three patients with tracheoscopy-verified compression of 
      the trachea had compromise of the distal trachea, and a tracheostomy would not 
      have been protective. All patients received sclerotherapy. The median time with 
      mechanical ventilation at the neonatal intensive care unit after each 
      sclerotherapy was eleven days (range 8-31). Each patient received sclerotherapy 
      in median three times (range 1-9). Five of the patients (71%) were operated with 
      excision of the LM in the mediastinum. Two of the patients were operated 
      primarily and three patients were operated after major complications to 
      sclerotherapy. The patients treated with sclerotherapy and the operated patients 
      had comparable amount of mild complications, Clavien-Dindo grade I-II 
      complications. Severe complications, Clavien-Dindo grade III-IV, were seen five 
      times more commonly after sclerotherapy than after surgery. The clinical outcome 
      was excellent for the operated patients and fair to good for the patients 
      receiving only sclerotherapy. CONCLUSION: Patients with cervical LM involving the 
      mediastinum represent a high-risk group with respect to the severity of 
      complications following sclerotherapy. The swelling is unpredictable and requires 
      extended observation at an intensive care unit with ventilation support. 
      Tracheostomy does not prevent tracheal compression in mediastinal LM, as the 
      malformation may compress trachea distal to the stoma. Surgical resection of the 
      LM in the mediastinum is recommended, with the possibility of intra-operative 
      sclerotherapy as an adjunctive. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.

TI  - Tissue Expansion Using Hyaluronic Acid Filler for Single-Stage Ear 
      Reconstruction: A Novel Concept for Difficult Areas.
PG  - 1085-1097
LID - 10.1093/asj/sjx119 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Auricular reconstruction is one of the most challenging procedures in 
      plastic surgery. An adequate skin envelope is essential for cartilage framework 
      coverage, yet few good options exist without additional surgery. We propose a 
      novel method for minimally invasive tissue expansion, using hyaluronic acid (HA) 
      filler to allow for single-stage ear reconstruction. OBJECTIVES: To introduce the 
      novel concept of HA filler for tissue expansion in ear reconstruction, and as an 
      alternative to traditional expansion techniques. METHODS: Macrolane is a large 
      particle HA gel developed for large volume restoration. Expansion of the 
      non-hair-bearing mastoid skin was performed in our clinic weekly or every other 
      week. Final expansion was completed one week prior to reconstructive surgery. 
      Tissue from one patient's expanded pocket was sent for histological analysis. 
      RESULTS: Ten patients underwent single-stage auricular reconstruction with 
      preoperative expansion. Injection sessions ranged from 7 to 13 (mean, 9.7). Mean 
      injected volume per session was 2.03 mL per patient, for an average total of 19.8 
      mL (range, 14.5-30 mL). There were no major complications. One minor complication 
      required removal of exposed wire from the antihelix in the office. Hematoxylin 
      and eosin stain revealed similar histology to that seen with traditional 
      expanders. CONCLUSIONS: This novel expansion technique using serial HA injections 
      allowed for optimized skin coverage in single-stage ear reconstruction. The 
      concept of tissue expansion using HA filler is a new frontier for research that 
      may be applicable to other arenas of reconstruction. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

TI  - Percutaneous Mesh Expansion: A Regenerative Wound Closure Alternative.
PG  - 451-457
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000004052 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Puncture wounds in the 1-mm range usually heal without scars. 
      Stacking rows of these punctures offers a scarless method to generate tissue by 
      mesh expansion. The authors developed a percutaneous mesh expansion procedure and 
      present their experience for its wound closure application. METHODS: Over a 
      6-year period, the authors applied percutaneous mesh expansion to 65 consecutive 
      patients aged 58 to 101 years (mean, 72 years) with 67 full-thickness calvarial 
      defects ranging in size from 2.5 x 3 cm to 7 x 8 cm (mean, 14 cm) that would have 
      all required flaps for closure. Thirty-six were still anticoagulated, and 20 had 
      prior scalp resections. After tumescent epinephrine anesthesia, the authors 
      temporarily approximate the wound by placing it under strong tension. Using 
      1.1-mm cutting point needles that selectively sever tissues under tension, the 
      authors inflict rows of staggered alternating punctures over a distance five 
      times the defect width. This results in 20 percent expansion of the meshed area, 
      generating the tissue necessary for defect coverage. When the tension is 
      completely released, closure is performed with simple sutures or staples. The 
      authors avoid overmeshing, especially close to the wound edges, and perform no 
      undermining or additional incisions. RESULTS: At 6-week follow-up, all defects 
      were healed with only a straight resection scar. However, of the 10 defects 
      larger than 5 x 5 cm, five had wound healing delay and three required a small 
      skin graft. No other complication was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous mesh 
      expansion is a minimally invasive procedure that harnesses the body's natural 
      capabilities to regenerate across small gaps. It sums these regenerated gaps in a 
      mesh pattern that expands tissues to close complex wounds without flaps or 
      additional incisions. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.

TI  - Early chemoprophylaxis is associated with decreased venous thromboembolism risk 
      without concomitant increase in intraspinal hematoma expansion after traumatic 
      spinal cord injury.
PG  - 1088-1094
LID - 10.1097/TA.0000000000001675 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: After traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), there is increased risk of 
      venous thromboembolism (VTE), but chemoprophylaxis (PPX) may cause expansion of 
      intraspinal hematoma (ISH). METHODS: Single-center retrospective study of adult 
      trauma patients from 2012 to 2015 with SCI. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: VTE diagnosis, 
      death, or discharge within 48 hours. Patients were dichotomized based on early 
      (</=48 hours) heparinoid and/or aspirin PPX. Intraspinal hematoma expansion was 
      diagnosed intraoperatively or by follow-up radiology. We used multivariable Cox 
      proportional hazards to estimate the effect of PPX on risk of VTE and ISH 
      expansion controlling for age, injury severity score (ISS), complete SCI, and 
      mechanism as static covariates and operative spine procedure as a time-varying 
      covariate. RESULTS: Five hundred one patients with SCI were dichotomized into 
      early PPX (n = 260 [52%]) and no early PPX (n = 241 [48%]). Early PPX patients 
      were less likely blunt injured (91% vs 97%) and had fewer operative spine 
      interventions (65% vs 80%), but age (median, 43 vs 49 years), ISS (median 24 vs 
      21), admission ISH (47% vs 44%), and VTE (5% vs 9%) were similar. Cox analysis 
      found that early heparinoids was associated with reduced VTE (hazard ratio [HR], 
      0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.84) and reduced pulmonary embolism 
      (PE) (HR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.06-0.69). The estimated number needed to treat with 
      heparinoids was 10 to prevent one VTE and 13 to prevent one PE at 30 days. Early 
      aspirin was not associated with reduced VTE or PE. Seven patients (1%) had ISH 
      expansion, of which four were on PPX at the time of expansion. Using heparinoid 
      and aspirin as time-varying covariates, neither heparinoids (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 
      0.32-11.41) nor aspirin (HR, 3.67; 95% CI, 0.64-20.88) was associated with ISH 
      expansion. CONCLUSION: Early heparinoid therapy was associated with decreased VTE 
      and PE risk in SCI patients without concomitant increase in ISH expansion. LEVEL 
      OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, level IV.

TI  - Gamma-irradiated human amniotic membrane decellularised with sodium dodecyl

      cells.

AB  - The gold standard substrate for the ex vivo expansion of human limbal stem cells 
      (LSCs) remains the human amniotic membrane (HAM) but this is not a defined 
      substrate and is subject to biological variability and the potential to transmit 
      disease. To better define HAM and mitigate the risk of disease transmission, we 
      sought to determine if decellularisation and/or gamma-irradiation have an adverse 
      effect on culture growth and LSC phenotype. Ex vivo limbal explant cultures were 
      set up on fresh HAM, HAM decellularised with 0.5M NaOH, and 0.5% (w/v) sodium 
      dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with or without gamma-irradiation. Explant growth rate was 
      measured and LSC phenotype was characterised by histology, immunostaining and 
      qRT-PCR (ABCG2, DeltaNp63, Ki67, CK12, and CK13). Y-irradiation marginally stiffened 
      HAM, as measured by Brillouin spectromicroscopy. HAM stiffness and gamma-irradiation 
      did not significantly affect the LSC phenotype, however LSCs expanded 
      significantly faster on Y-irradiated SDS decellularised HAM (p<0.05) which was 
      also corroborated by the highest expression of Ki67 and putative LSC marker, 
      ABCG2. Colony forming efficiency assays showed a greater yield and proportion of 
      holoclones in cells cultured on Y-irradiated SDS decellularised HAM. Together our 
      data indicate that SDS decellularised HAM may be a more efficacious substrate for 
      the expansion of LSCs and the use of a gamma-irradiated HAM allows the user to start 
      the manufacturing process with a sterile substrate, potentially making it safer. 
      STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Despite its disadvantages, including its biological 
      variability and its ability to transfer disease, human amniotic membrane (HAM) 
      remains the gold standard substrate for limbal stem cell (LSC) culture. To 
      address these disadvantages, we used a decellularised HAM sterilised by 
      gamma-irradiation for LSC culture. We cultured LSCs on fresh HAM, HAM 
      decellularised with NaOH, HAM decellularised with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) 
      and HAM decellularised with SDS and sterilised with gamma-irradiation. We 
      demonstrated that although HAM decellularised with SDS and sterilised with 
      gamma-irradiation is significantly stiffer this does not affect LSC culture 
      growth rate or the phenotype of cultured LSCs. We therefore recommend the use of 
      SDS decellularised gamma-irradiated HAM in future LSC clinical trials.

TI  - Do different maxillary expansion appliances influence the outcomes of the 
      treatment?
PG  - 97-106
LID - 10.1093/ejo/cjx035 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is no consensus in the literature regarding 
      which rapid maxillary expansion (RME) design or activation rate benefits the 
      patients the most. Therefore, the primary aim of this systematic review was to 
      see whether there is a difference in the skeletal and dentoalveolar effects of 
      different RME appliances in children and growing adolescents. The secondary aim 
      was to see whether these effects are different when using different activation 
      protocols for these appliances. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The search was done 
      in three databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science). The following 
      inclusion criteria were used: randomized controlled trial, prospective controlled 
      studies, 15 or more patients in each study, human subjects up to 18 years of age, 
      and RME effects had to be assessed by computed tomography/cone beam computed 
      tomography. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Quality of the methodology was 
      classified according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development 
      and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines as high, moderate, or low. RESULTS: The search 
      resulted in 145 titles and abstracts; 109 of them were excluded based on 
      pre-established criteria. Thirty-six full-text articles were assessed for 
      eligibility and 18 of which satisfied the inclusion criteria. Finally, seven 
      articles were deemed eligible for full inclusion and revealed that all appliances 
      and protocols showed significant expansion in the mid-palatal suture. No evidence 
      was found for the cause of dental tipping. LIMITATIONS: In this systematic 
      review, having different age groups in each study and using different anatomical 
      landmarks and outcome measures for assessing the skeletal and dental effects made 
      it difficult to conduct a meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate evidence 
      that all designs produce significant expansion at the mid-palatal suture. 
      However, lack of studies comparing appliances and protocols has been found. 
      Finally, no evidence-based conclusions could be drawn about the appliance effect 
      on teeth tipping. IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: No appliance appears to be 
      superior when it comes to expansion in the mid-palatal suture. Therefore, the 
      tooth-borne appliance might be preferable until further high-quality studies 
      conclude otherwise. FUNDING: The project was funded through the Department of 
      Orthodontics, Postgraduate Dental Education Center, Region Orebro County, Orebro, 
      Sweden. REGISTRATION: This systematic review was not registered in any external 
      databases.

TI  - Potential impact of Affordable Care Act-related insurance expansion on trauma 
      care reimbursement.
PG  - 887-895
LID - 10.1097/TA.0000000000001400 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nearly one quarter of trauma patients are uninsured and hospitals 
      recoup less than 20% of inpatient costs for their care. This study examines 
      changes to hospital reimbursement for inpatient trauma care if the full coverage 
      expansion provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) were in effect. METHODS: We 
      abstracted nonelderly adults (ages 18-64 years) admitted for trauma from the 
      Nationwide Inpatient Sample during 2010-the last year before most major ACA 
      coverage expansion policies. We calculated national and facility-level 
      reimbursements and trauma-related contribution margins using Nationwide Inpatient 
      Sample-supplied cost-to-charge ratios and published reimbursement rates for each 
      payer type. Using US census data, we developed a probabilistic microsimulation 
      model to determine the proportion of pre-ACA uninsured trauma patients that would 
      be expected to gain private insurance, Medicaid, or remain uninsured after full 
      implementation of the ACA. We then estimated the impact of these coverage changes 
      on national and facility-level trauma reimbursement for this population. RESULTS: 
      There were 145,849 patients (representing 737,852 patients nationwide) included. 
      National inpatient trauma costs for patients aged 18 years to 64 years totaled US 
      $14.8 billion (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.5,17.1). Preexpansion 
      reimbursements totaled US $13.7 billion (95% CI, 10.8-14.7), yielding a national 
      margin of -7.9% (95% CI, -10.6 to -5.1). Postexpansion projected reimbursements 
      totaled US $15.0 billion (95% CI, 12.7-17.3), increasing the margin by 9.3 
      absolute percentage points to +1.4% (95% CI, -0.3 to +3.2). Of the 263 eligible 
      facilities, 90 (34.2%) had a positive trauma-related contribution margin in 2010, 
      which increased to 171 (65.0%) using postexpansion projections. Those facilities 
      with the highest proportion of uninsured and racial/ethnic minorities experienced 
      the greatest gains. CONCLUSION: Health insurance coverage expansion for uninsured 
      trauma patients has the potential to increase national reimbursement for 
      inpatient trauma care by over one billion dollars and nearly double the 
      proportion of hospitals with a positive margin for trauma care. These data 
      suggest that insurance coverage expansion has the potential to improve trauma 
      centers' financial viability and their ability to provide care for their 
      communities. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic analysis, level II.

TI  - Patients Without Intraoperative Neuromonitoring (IONM) Alerts During VEPTR 
      Implantation Did Not Sustain Neurological Injury During Subsequent Routine 
      Expansions: A Retrospective Multicenter Cohort Study.
PG  - e619-e624
LID - 10.1097/BPO.0000000000000976 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of intraoperative 
      neurological monitoring (IONM) alerts and neurological injury during vertical 
      expandable prosthetic titanium rib (VEPTR) treatment and evaluate the utility of 
      IONM during VEPTR expansion procedures in patients who have not previously had 
      neurological injury or IONM alerts. METHODS: After institutional review board 
      approval, VEPTR procedures and IONM records were reviewed at 17 institutions for 
      patients treated with VEPTR from 2005 to 2011. All consecutive cases in patients 
      with minimum 2-year follow-up were included. Patients with prior history of 
      growing rods or other invasive spine-based surgical treatment were excluded. 
      Surgeries were categorized into implant, revision, expansion, and removal 
      procedures. Cases with IONM alerts or neurological injury had additional detailed 
      review. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. RESULTS: In total, 
      2355 consecutive VEPTR procedures (352 patients) consisting of 299 implant, 377 
      revision, 1587 expansion, and 92 removal procedures were included. In total, 620 
      VEPTR procedures had IONM, and 539 of those had IONM records available for 
      review. IONM alerts occurred in 9/539 procedures (1.7%): 3/192 implants (1.6%), 
      3/58 revisions (5.2%), and 3/258 expansions (1.2%). New neurological injury 
      occurred in 3/2355 procedures (0.1%), 3/352 patients (0.9%). All 3 injuries were 
      in implant procedures, only 1 had an IONM alert. All 3 had upper extremity motor 
      deficits (1 had sensory deficit also). All had full recovery at 17, 30, and 124 
      days postinjury. One patient without prior neurological injury or IONM alert had 
      an IONM alert during expansion that resolved after an increase in blood pressure. 
      The remaining IONM alerts during expansions were all in children with prior IONM 
      alerts during implant, revision, or exchange procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The highest 
      rate of neurological injury in VEPTR surgery was found for implant procedures. 
      There were no instances of neurological injury during VEPTR expansion, revision, 
      or removal procedures. IONM did not identify new neurological injuries in 
      patients undergoing VEPTR expansion who did not previously have a history of IONM 
      signal change or neurologic injury. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV-diagnostic study.

TI  - Carbon Dioxide-Based versus Saline Tissue Expansion for Breast Reconstruction: 
      Results of the XPAND Prospective, Randomized Clinical Trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: AeroForm is a new type of remote-controlled, needle-free, carbon 
      dioxide-based expander involving a potentially faster method of tissue expansion. 
      Results are presented here from the AirXpanders Patient Activated Controlled 
      Tissue Expander pivotal trial comparing AeroForm to saline tissue expanders. 
      METHODS: Women undergoing two-stage breast reconstruction were randomized at 17 
      U.S. sites in this U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved investigational 
      device exemption trial. Expansion in the investigational arm was performed by the 
      patient in 10-cc increments up to 30 cc/day of carbon dioxide and in the control 
      arm by the physician with periodic bolus injections of saline. Safety endpoints, 
      expansion and reconstruction times, pain, and satisfaction were assessed. 
      RESULTS: One hundred fifty women were treated: 98 with carbon dioxide expanders 
      (n = 168) and 52 with saline expanders (n = 88). The treatment success rate (all 
      breasts exchanged successfully excluding non-device-related failures) was 96.1 
      percent for carbon dioxide and 98.8 percent for saline. Median time to full 
      expansion and completion of the second-stage operation was 21.0 and 108.5 days 
      (carbon dioxide) versus 46.0 and 136.5 days (saline), respectively, with a 
      similar rate of overall complications. Ease of use for the carbon dioxide 
      expander was rated high by patients (98 percent) and physicians (90 percent). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The AirXpanders Patient Activated Controlled Tissue Expander trial 
      results demonstrate that a carbon dioxide-based expander is an effective method 
      of tissue expansion with a similar overall adverse event rate compared to saline 
      expanders, and provides a more convenient and expedient expansion. CLINICAL 
      QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, I.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease characterized by loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. SCA6 is caused 
      by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in CACNA1A, which encodes Cav2.1, alpha1A 
      subunit of P/Q-type calcium channel. However, the pathogenic mechanism and 
      effective therapeutic treatments are still unknown. Here, we have succeeded in 
      generating differentiated Purkinje cells that carry patient genes by combining 
      disease-specific iPSCs and self-organizing culture technologies. Patient-derived 
      Purkinje cells exhibit increased levels of full-length Cav2.1 protein but 
      decreased levels of its C-terminal fragment and downregulation of the 
      transcriptional targets TAF1 and BTG1. We further demonstrate that SCA6 Purkinje 
      cells exhibit thyroid hormone depletion-dependent degeneration, which can be 
      suppressed by two compounds, thyroid releasing hormone and Riluzole. Thus, we 
      have constructed an in vitro disease model recapitulating both ontogenesis and 
      pathogenesis. This model may be useful for pathogenic investigation and drug 
      screening.

      clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast augmentation with fat transfer does not bear the risks 
      associated with silicone implantation. The method can potentially be especially 
      useful in Asian women, who often reject augmentation mammoplasty with implants. 
      This prospective clinical trial evaluated the effects of external breast 
      expansion on breast density and vessel count using magnetic resonance imaging. 
      METHODS: Thirty-four enrolled patients were instructed to apply one of two 
      devices, the conventional BRAVA device (used in the AESTES trial) or a novel 
      external expansion device (EVERA) designed for Asian women, continuously for 8 h 
      per day for 12 weeks. For external expansion, the pressure was set to 25 mmHg. 
      Follow-up examinations were performed for 4 weeks after completion of the 
      expansion. The ratio between the fibroglandular and adipose tissues of the breast 
      was measured using T1-weighted MRI, and the number of vessels in the breast 
      tissue was determined before and after the treatment by contrast MRI. 
      Additionally, the volume of the breast was measured by laser scanning before, 
      during, and after the device application. The obtained measurements were compared 
      within and between the groups at different time points. RESULTS: Six patients 
      dropped out, while 28 completed the trial without major side effects or adverse 
      events. External expansion significantly increased breast vessel count in both 
      the EVERA and AESTES groups (p = 0.019, p = 0.022). However, it did not 
      significantly change breast density in either group (p = 0.186, p = 0.638). No 
      significant intergroup differences were noted in vessel count (p = 0.874) or 
      density (p = 0.482). Breast volume increases after 12 weeks of application were 
      statistically significant in both groups, with mean changes of 81 +/- 22 cc 
      (AESTES) and 98 +/- 30 cc (EVERA) (p < 0.001 in both cases). CONCLUSIONS: External 
      expansion resulted in a marked increase in breast vessel count but did not affect 
      breast density. The observed increase in breast volume can be considered 
      substantial for Asian women. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study.

TI  - Comparison by multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis and antimicrobial 
      resistance among atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strains isolated from 
      food samples and human and animal faecal specimens.
PG  - 268-278

AB  - AIM: This study assessed whether multilocus variable-number tandem repeat 
      analysis (MLVA) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing discriminated 
      diarrhoeagenic atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (aEPEC) from aEPEC 
      indigenous to domestic animals or healthy people. METHODS AND RESULTS: MLVA 
      genotyping of 142 aEPEC strains isolated from foods and faecal samples of 
      domestic animals and humans revealed 126 distinct MLVA profiles that distributed 
      to four clusters, yielding a Simpson's index of diversity (D) of 99.8%. Cluster 2 
      included 87% of cattle isolates and 67% of patient isolates. The plurality 
      (15/34, 44%) of strains from healthy humans mapped to Cluster 1, while half 
      (18/41, 44%) of the swine strains belonged to Cluster 4. Testing for 
      antimicrobial susceptibility revealed that 52 strains (37%) of aEPEC were 
      resistant to one or more agents; only 10 strains (7%) exhibited resistance to 
      more than three agents. Strains isolated from swine or food exhibited a wider 
      variety of resistance phenotypes than bovine or human strains. CONCLUSIONS: MLVA 
      assigned the aEPEC isolates from cattle and patients to Cluster 2, distinct from 
      aEPEC from other sources. Hog yards may be a larger source of drug-resistant 
      strains than are cattle ranches. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: MLVA 
      suggests that human diarrhoeagenic aEPEC are derived from cattle and are distinct 
      from strains carried by healthy people and other animals. Cattle appear to be 
      reservoirs of human diarrhoeagenic aEPEC.

TI  - ASSOCIATION BETWEEN A pMAH135 PLASMID AND THE PROGRESSION OF PULMONARY DISEASE 
      CAUSED BY MYCOBACTERIUM AVIUM.
PG  - 9-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary disease caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria has a 
      variable clinical course. Although this is possibly the result of not only host 
      factors, but also bacterial factors, many questions remain to be answered 
      regarding these manifestations. METHODS: To assess the relationship between the 
      progression of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium disease and bacterial factors we 
      performed variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) typing analysis of M. avium 
      tandem repeats (MATR) in M. avium isolates from 46 patients with different 
      clinical courses, and furthermore, examined the association between disease 
      progression and a pMAH135 plasmid derived from M. avium. RESULTS: In patients 
      whose treatment was initiated because of worsenedchest radiograph findings and/or 
      clinical symptoms within 18 months after being diagnosed with pulmonary M. avium 
      disease, the detection rate of 6 genes located in pMAH135 was 35.3-47.1% for 17 
      isolates. However, in untreated patients with a stable condition, these rates 
      were 10.3-13.8% in 29 isolates. MATR-VNTR typing analysis showed that isolates 
      from patients with worsened disease and those with stable disease are clustered 
      differently. In cluster III, the number of isolates from patients with worsened 
      disease was higher than that from patients with stable disease (p = 0.019), and 
      furthermore, the number of isolates carrying pMAH135 genes was higher than that 
      not carrying pMAH135 genes (p </= 0.001). CONCLUSION: These results indicate an 
      association between the progression of pulmonary M. avium disease and pMAH135. 
      The presence of pMAH135 genes might be a useful prognostic indicator for 
      pulmonary M. avium disease and may serve as one criterion for treatment 
      initiation.

TI  - Presence of inclusions positive for polyglycine containing protein, FMRpolyG, 
      indicates that repeat-associated non-AUG translation plays a role in fragile 
      X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency.
PG  - 158-68
LID - 10.1093/humrep/dev280 [doi]
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Does repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation play a role in 
      fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), leading to the 
      presence of polyglycine containing protein (FMRpolyG)-positive inclusions in 
      ovarian tissue? SUMMARY ANSWER: Ovaries of a woman with FXPOI and of an Fmr1 
      premutation (PM) mouse model (exCGG-KI) contain intranuclear inclusions that 
      stain positive for both FMRpolyG and ubiquitin. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Women who 
      carry the FMR1 PM are at 20-fold increased risk to develop primary ovarian 
      insufficiency (FXPOI). A toxic RNA gain-of-function has been suggested as the 
      underlying mechanism since the PM results in increased levels of mRNA containing 
      an expanded repeat, but reduced protein levels of fragile X mental retardation 
      protein (FMRP). Recently, RAN translation has been shown to occur from FMR1 mRNA 
      that contains PM repeat expansions, leading to FMRpolyG inclusions in brain and 
      non-CNS tissues of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) patients. 
      STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Ovaries of a woman with FXPOI and women without PM 
      (controls), and ovaries from wild-type and exCGG-KI mice were analyzed by 
      immunohistochemistry for the presence of inclusions that stained for ubiquitin 
      and FMRpolyG . The ovaries from wild-type and exCGG-KI mice were further 
      characterized for the number of follicles, Fmr1 mRNA levels and FMRP protein 
      expression. The presence of inclusions was also analyzed in pituitaries of a man 
      with FXTAS and the exCGG-KI mice. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Human 
      ovaries from a woman with FXPOI and two control subjects and pituitaries from a 
      man with FXTAS and a control subjects were fixed in 4% formalin. Ovaries and 
      pituitaries of wild-type and exCGG mice were fixed in Bouin's fluid or 4% 
      paraformaldehyde. Immunohistochemistry was performed on the human and mouse 
      samples using FMRpolyG, ubiquitin and Fmrp antibodies. Fmr1 mRNA and protein 
      expression were determined in mouse ovaries by quantitative RT-PCR and Western 
      blot analysis. Follicle numbers in mouse ovaries were determined in serial 
      sections by microscopy. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: FMRpolyG-positive 
      inclusions were present in ovarian stromal cells of a woman with FXPOI but not in 
      the ovaries of control subjects. The FMRpolyG-positive inclusions colocalized 
      with ubiquitin-positive inclusions. Similar inclusions were also observed in the 
      pituitary of a man with FXTAS but not in control subjects. Similarly, ovaries of 
      40-week-old exCGG-KI mice, but not wild-type mice, contained numerous inclusions 
      in the stromal cells that stained for both FMRpolyG- and ubiquitin, while the 
      ovaries of 20-week-old exCGG-KI contained fewer inclusions. At 40 weeks ovarian 
      Fmr1 mRNA expression was increased by 5-fold in exCGG-KI mice compared with 
      wild-type mice, while Fmrp expression was reduced by 2-fold. With respect to 
      ovarian function in exCGG-KI mice: (i) although the number of healthy growing 
      follicles did not differ between wild-type and exCGG-KI mice, the number of 
      atretic large antral follicles was increased by nearly 9-fold in 40-week old 
      exCGG-KI mice (P < 0.001); (ii) at 40 weeks of age only 50% of exCGG-KI mice had 
      recent ovulations compared with 89% in wild-type mice (P = 0.07) and (iii) those 
      exCGG-KI mice with recent ovulations tended to have a reduced number of fresh 
      corpora lutea (4.8 +/- 1.74 versus 8.50 +/- 0.98, exCGG-KI versus wild-type mice, 
      respectively, P = 0.07). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Although 
      FMRpolyG-positive inclusions were detected in ovaries of both a woman with FXPOI 
      and a mouse model of the FMR1 PM, we only analyzed one ovary from a FXPOI 
      subject. Caution is needed to extrapolate these results to all women with the 
      FMR1 PM. Furthermore, the functional consequence of FMRpolyG-positive inclusions 
      in the ovaries for reproduction remains to be determined. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF 
      THE FINDINGS: Our results suggest that a dysfunctional 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal-axis may contribute to FXPOI in FMR1 PM carriers.

TI  - First Vault Expansion in Apert and Crouzon-Pfeiffer Syndromes: Front or Back?
PG  - 112e-121e
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000001894 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with Apert and Crouzon-Pfeiffer syndromes are at risk of 
      intracranial hypertension. Until 2005, when the authors switched to occipital 
      expansion, their institution's preferred treatment was fronto-orbital 
      advancement. However, it was still unclear whether (1) occipitofrontal head 
      circumference (i.e., intracranial volume) was greater after occipital expansion 
      than after fronto-orbital advancement; (2) the incidences of tonsillar herniation 
      and papilledema were lower; and (3) visual acuity was better during follow-up. In 
      these patients, the authors therefore compared fronto-orbital advancement with 
      occipital expansion as the first surgical procedure. METHODS: Measurements 
      included repeated occipitofrontal head circumference as a measure for 
      intracranial volume; neuroimaging to evaluate tonsillar herniation; funduscopy to 
      identify papilledema; and visual acuity testing. RESULTS: The authors included 37 
      patients (Apert syndrome, n = 18; Crouzon-Pfeiffer syndrome, n = 19). Eighteen 
      underwent fronto-orbital advancement and 19 underwent occipital expansion (age at 
      surgery, 1.0 versus 1.5 years; p = 0.13). Follow-up time in both groups was 5.7 
      years. The increase in occipitofrontal head circumference (+1.09 SD) was greater 
      after occipital expansion than after fronto-orbital advancement (+0.32 SD) (p = 
      0.03). After occipital expansion, fewer patients with Crouzon-Pfeiffer syndrome 
      had tonsillar herniation (occipital, three of 11; fronto-orbital advancement, 
      seven of eight; p = 0.02); for both syndromes together, fewer patients had 
      papilledema (occipital, four of 19; fronto-orbital advancement, 11 of 18; p = 
      0.02). Visual acuity was similar after fronto-orbital advancement and occipital 
      expansion (0.09 versus 0.13 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) (p = 
      0.28). CONCLUSIONS: The authors' preference for occipital expansion as the 
      initial craniofacial procedure in Apert and Crouzon-Pfeiffer syndromes is 
      supported by the greater increase it produces in intracranial volume (as 
      evidenced by the occipitofrontal head circumference), which reduces the 
      incidences of tonsillar herniation and papilledema. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III.

TI  - Diminished ovarian reserve is not observed in infertility patients with high 
      normal CGG repeats on the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene.
PG  - 2686-92
LID - 10.1093/humrep/dev220 [doi]
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Does an association exist between high normal numbers of CGG 
      trinucleotide repeats on the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene and 
      diminished ovarian reserve (DOR)? SUMMARY ANSWER: This large data set 
      demonstrated that a high normal number of CGG repeats (35-54 repeats) on the FMR1 
      gene was not significantly correlated with DOR. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The FMR1 
      premutation (55-200 repeats) is a known cause of primary ovarian insufficiency. 
      However, the relationship between high normal CGG repeat numbers (35-54 repeats) 
      and ovarian reserve has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, 
      DURATION: This is a retrospective data analysis conducted between January 2012 
      and February 2014 that included 1287 women. Over 1140 women had complete data. 
      PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All women, excluding oocyte donors, who 
      presented to a large private practice specializing in reproductive endocrinology 
      and infertility for treatment and who underwent both fragile X and ovarian 
      reserve testing were included. All fragile X testing was performed using triplet 
      repeat PCR, with confirmation of positives by Southern blot. CGG repeat numbers 
      from both alleles were recorded, and the allele with the higher number of repeats 
      was used for statistical calculations. We did not differentiate between patients 
      with one or two high normal alleles. Women with >54 CGG repeats were excluded 
      from the analysis. For our analysis, we considered both a 'high normal' number of 
      CGG repeats (35-44) and an intermediate number of GCC repeats (45-54) as 'high 
      normal'. Ovarian reserve testing was carried out on Cycle Day 2 or 3 and included 
      measurements of FSH, anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and antral follicle count 
      (AFC). A generalized linear regression model assuming gamma distribution and log 
      link function that controlled for age was used to assess correlation between CGG 
      repeat number and FSH, AMH and AFC. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: As 
      expected, there was a significant correlation between increasing age and 
      increasing FSH and decreasing AFC and AMH for the patients in this study. For 
      every 1-year increase in age, FSH increased by a factor of 1.04, AFC decreased by 
      a factor of 0.93 and AMH decreased by a factor of 0.89. After controlling for 
      age, there was no significant correlation between FMR1 CGG trinucleotide repeat 
      number and FSH (P = 0.23), AFC (P = 0.14) or AMH (P = 0.53). Three subgroup 
      analyses were also performed. We found a significant relationship between 
      increasing CGG repeat number and decreasing AMH levels (P = 0.01) in women >44 
      years old. The second subgroup analysis included only Caucasian patients and 
      found no significant correlation between CGG repeat number and DOR. In a subgroup 
      analysis comparing women with at least one allele <26 repeats, at least one 
      allele >35 and women with both alleles between 29 and 32, there were no 
      significant associations regarding ovarian reserve in any of these groups. 
      LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: One limitation of this study is that it 
      involved a heterogeneous population of infertile women with mixed diagnoses. 
      Factors that could affect ovarian reserve, such as medical comorbidities, prior 
      surgeries, family history and endometriosis, were not accounted for. Finally, 
      there was a lack of racial diversity, with Caucasians representing 67.8% of the 
      total population. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The findings of this study 
      are generalizable to an infertility population and are in line with several 
      previously published studies. Women who are found to have high normal CGG repeat 
      numbers can be counseled that this is not causative for DOR. Further studies are 
      needed to investigate whether increasing CGG repeat numbers are associated with 
      ovarian responsiveness to gonadotrophin stimulation or IVF outcome.

TI  - Rapid Palatal Expansion to Treat Nocturnal Enuretic Children: a Systematic Review 
      and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 138-48
AB  - STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: Refractory nocturnal enuresis possesses a heavy 
      psychosocial burden for the affected child. Only a 15% spontaneous annual cure 
      rate is reported. PURPOSE: This patient-level meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the 
      efficacy of rapid palatal expansion to treat nocturnal enuresis among children. 
      MATERIALS AND METHOD: A sensitive search of electronic databases of PubMed (since 
      1966), SCOPUS (containing EMBASE, since 1980), Cochrane Central Register of 
      Controlled Trials, CINAHL and EBSCO till Jan 2014 was performed. A set of regular 
      terms was used for searching in data banks except for PubMed, for which medical 
      subject headings (MeSH) keywords were used. Children aged at least six years old 
      at the time of recruitment of either gender who underwent rapid palatal expansion 
      and had attempted any type of pharmacotherapy prior to orthodontic intervention 
      were included. RESULTS: Six non-randomized clinical trials were found relevant, 
      of which five studies had no control group. Eighty children were investigated 
      with the mean age of 118 (28.12) months ranged from 74 to 185 months. The median 
      time to become completely dry was 2.87 months [confidence interval (CI) 95% 
      2.07-2.93 months]. After one year, the average rate of becoming complete dry was 
      31%. The presence of posterior cross bite [relative risk (RR): 0.31, CI 95%: 
      0.12-0.79] and signs of upper respiratory obstruction during sleep (RR: 5.1, CI 
      95%: 1.44-18.04) significantly decreased and increased the chance of improvement, 
      respectively. Meanwhile, the other predictors did not significantly predict the 
      outcome after simultaneous adjustment in Cox regression model. CONCLUSION: Rapid 
      palatal expansion may be considered when other treatment modalities have failed. 
      The 31% rate of cure is promising when compared to the spontaneous cure rate. 
      Though, high-level evidence from the rigorous randomized controlled trials is 
      scarce (Level of evidence: C).

TI  - Changing the Donor Site Selection Concept of Facial Skin Expansion from Pure 
      Healthy Tissue to Defect and Healthy Tissue Combination.
PG  - 745-51
LID - 10.1007/s00266-015-0547-z [doi]
AB  - Facial defect reconstruction is a challenge for plastic surgeons due to unique 
      esthetic and functional properties of the region. Facial tissue expansion 
      provides an ideal reconstruction resource. However, the donor site is limited in 
      the facial region. Thus, a cost-effective expansion management is crucial for an 
      efficient reconstruction. In this article, the evolution of our donor site 
      preference for tissue expansion from pure healthy tissue to a defect-healthy 
      tissue combination is presented. Fifteen patients underwent skin reconstruction 
      with local tissue expansion for facial and cervical defects. The full facial or 
      cervical region including the defect and healthy tissue combination was 
      determined as the donor expansion site. The donor site was not limited only to 
      pure healthy tissue. The largest size rectangular expander suitable for the 
      combined expandable donor site size was placed under the defect and healthy 
      tissue border, paying attention to carry the expander far beneath the defect 
      site. The defect site and most adjacent healthy tissue were expanded 
      simultaneously. Major complications such as infection, hematoma, rupture, or flap 
      necrosis were not observed. The expansion of defect-healthy tissue border 
      presented successful reconstruction results with acceptable scars. In the 
      traditional tissue expansion concept, using a large size expander to provide more 
      abundant flap gain does not comply with the limited size of healthy donor site in 
      the face. Expanding the whole facial region, without restriction of the defect, 
      supplies excess donor tissue area for larger size expander use. Eventually, 
      defect-healthy tissue border expansion with large expanders results in minimum 
      final scar and less tissue loss in flap relocation and enables optimal flap gain. 
      This method can easily be adapted to any tissue expansion site of the body. LEVEL

TI  - Degree of bioresorbable vascular scaffold expansion modulates loss of essential 
      function.

AB  - Drug-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVSs) have the potential to 
      restore lumen patency, enable recovery of the native vascular environment, and 
      circumvent late complications associated with permanent endovascular devices. To 
      ensure therapeutic effects persist for sufficient times prior to scaffold 
      resorption and resultant functional loss, many factors dictating BVS performance 
      must be identified, characterized and optimized. While some factors relate to BVS 
      design and manufacturing, others depend on device deployment and intrinsic 
      vascular properties. Importantly, these factors interact and cannot be considered 
      in isolation. The objective of this study is to quantify the extent to which 
      degree of radial expansion modulates BVS performance, specifically in the context 
      of modifying device erosion kinetics and evolution of structural mechanics and 
      local drug elution. We systematically varied degree of radial expansion in model 
      BVS constructs composed of poly dl-lactide-glycolide and generated in vitro 
      metrics of device microstructure, degradation, erosion, mechanics and drug 
      release. Experimental data permitted development of computational models that 
      predicted transient concentrations of scaffold-derived soluble species and drug 
      in the arterial wall, thus enabling speculation on the short- and long-term 
      effects of differential expansion. We demonstrate that degree of expansion 
      significantly affects scaffold properties critical to functionality, underscoring 
      its relevance in BVS design and optimization. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) therapy is beginning to transform the 
      treatment of obstructive artery disease, owing to effective treatment of short 
      term vessel closure while avoiding long term consequences such as in situ, late 
      stent thrombosis - a fatal event associated with permanent implants such as 
      drug-eluting stents. As device scaffolding and drug elution are temporary for 
      BVS, the notion of using this therapy in lieu of existing, clinically approved 
      devices seems attractive. However, there is still a limited understanding 
      regarding the optimal lifetime and performance characteristics of erodible 
      endovascular implants. Several engineering criteria must be met and clinical 
      endpoints confirmed to ensure these devices are both safe and effective. In this 
      manuscript, we sought to establish general principles for the design and 
      deployment of erodible, drug-eluting endovascular scaffolds, with focus on how 
      differential expansion can modulate device performance.

      Jarcho-Levin Syndrome.
PG  - e12
LID - 10.2106/JBJS.ST.N.00017 [doi]
LID - e12
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although surgical treatment of spondylothoracic dysplasia (STD) is 
      controversial, we have found that an expansion thoracoplasty using a Vertical 
      Expandable Prosthetic Titanium Rib (VEPTR; DePuy Synthes) results in favorable 
      outcomes, including 100% survivability (at an average follow-up of 6.2 years), 
      increased thoracic spinal length, and decreased requirements for ventilation 
      support. STEP 1 PREOPERATIVE PREPARATION: Make anteroposterior and lateral 
      radiographs of the spine. STEP 2 POSITION THE PATIENT FOR THE PROCEDURE: The 
      patient is placed in the prone position. STEP 3 THE INCISION: A curvilinear skin 
      incision is made, starting proximally between the spine and the medial edge of 
      the scapula. STEP 4 THE OSTEOTOMY: Perform the v-osteotomy. STEP 5 PLACEMENT OF 
      THE VEPTR DEVICE: A number-4 VEPTR-I device is wedged in, starting laterally 
      within the osteotomy sites, wedging the osteotomies apart, distracting the 
      superior ribs proximally and the inferior ribs distally, lengthening the 
      hemithorax, and stopping approximately at the posterior axillary line, when there 
      is maximum stress on the superior and inferior ribs, to avoid fracture, and the 
      lamina spreaders are then removed. STEP 6 WOUND CLOSURE: Insert drains and local 
      anesthetic catheters and close the wound. STEP 7 EXPANSION AND REPLACEMENT 
      PROCEDURES: Lengthen the devices with the standard VEPTR technique of limited 
      3-cm incisions every three to six months. RESULTS: VEPTR treatment in patients 
      with STD is associated with increased thoracic spine height and reduced thoracic 
      width-to-height ratio, suggesting a greater gain in height than in width. WHAT TO

TI  - Volumetric changes in cranial vault expansion: comparison of fronto-orbital 
      advancement and posterior cranial vault distraction osteogenesis.
PG  - 1665-1672
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000001294 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Posterior cranial vault distraction osteogenesis has recently been 
      introduced to treat patients with multisuture syndromic craniosynostosis and is 
      believed to provide greater gains in intracranial volume. This study provides 
      volumetric analysis to determine the gains in intracranial volume produced by 
      this modality. METHODS: This was a two-center retrospective study of preprocedure 
      and postprocedure computed tomography scans of two groups of 15 patients each 
      with syndromic multisuture craniosynostosis treated with either fronto-orbital 
      advancement or posterior cranial vault distraction osteogenesis. Scan data were 
      analyzed volumetrically with Mimics software. Volumetric gains attributable to 
      growth between scans were controlled for. RESULTS: The mean advancements were 
      12.5 mm for fronto-orbital advancement and 24.8 mm for distraction osteogenesis. 
      The mean difference in volume between the preoperative and postoperative scans 
      was 144 cm(3) for fronto-orbital advancement and 274 cm(3) for (p = 0.009). After 
      controlling for growth, the corrected mean volume difference was 66 cm(3) for 
      fronto-orbital advancement and 142 cm(3) for distraction osteogenesis (p = 
      0.0017). The corrected mean volume difference per millimeter of advancement was 
      4.6 cm(3) for fronto-orbital advancement and 5.8 cm(3) for distraction (p = 
      0.357). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective study, posterior cranial vault 
      distraction osteogenesis provided statistically greater intracranial volume 
      expansion than fronto-orbital advancement. The volume gains per millimeter 
      advancement were similar between groups, with a trend toward greater gains per 
      millimeter with distraction osteogenesis. Gradual expansion of the overlying soft 
      tissues with posterior cranial vault distraction osteogenesis appears to be the 
      primary mechanism for greater volume gains with this technique. CLINICAL

TI  - Armadillo cranioplasty for expansion and remodeling in craniosynostosis.
PG  - 233-237
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000000830 [doi]
AB  - Craniosynostosis is typically treated in the first year of life, when osteogenic 
      potential is high and residual obligate skull defects heal. Delayed 
      reconstruction can result in persistent skull defects because of diminished 
      osteogenic potential. Adequately expanding the cranium yet minimizing residual 
      skull defects in older patients presents a conundrum. Although secondary 
      cranioplasty can be performed, primary cortical bone coverage is preferred. The 
      authors present a technique of cranial expansion by sliding stairstep 
      osteotomies, thus preventing residual skull defects when treating 
      craniosynostosis at an advanced age. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:

TI  - Multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis of Francisella tularensis 
      from Quebec, Canada.
PG  - 328-33
LID - 10.1111/lam.12371 [doi]
AB  - Francisella tularensis is ubiquitous in the Northern Hemisphere. Yet, little is 
      known about the disease and its ecology within Canada as few serological studies 
      have shown exposure to the disease and fewer case studies have been reported. 
      This report is the first to describe the molecular subtyping of F. tularensis 
      isolates within eastern Canada using multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat 
      analysis. From 1998 to 2011, a total of 73 specimens were isolated from unique 
      human and animal sources. As expected, F. tularensis subsp. tularensis AI and F. 
      tularensis subsp. holarctica subtypes were observed, corresponding to the known 
      geographical division within this species. The majority of human isolates (78%) 
      and all animal (hare) isolates were of the more virulent, AI type. Half of the B 
      isolates were isolated from patients living in a region of Quebec where muskrat 
      densities are known to be high. A relatively high level of marker diversity was 
      found, suggestive of multiple introductions of the organism to the region, or 
      more likely ongoing endemicity. There was no evidence of ongoing outbreaks or 
      transmission, and the bulk of cases were likely due to interaction between human 
      activity and the environment (e.g. hunting/trapping activities). SIGNIFICANCE AND 
      IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study reveals the diversity of Francisella tularensis 
      in eastern Canada using multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis. It 
      was initiated to further the understanding of the species within North America as 
      previous studies elucidating the diversity and phylogeography of the species have 
      consisted mostly of specimens from the United States. Type A tularaemia, the most 
      life-threatening subtype of the species and a Category A biothreat agent, is 
      restricted to North America, and this study serves to broaden the knowledge of 
      the epidemiology and diversity of the organism.

TI  - Molecular analysis and MIRU-VNTR typing of Mycobacterium avium subsp. 
      paratuberculosis strains from various sources.
PG  - 275-83
LID - 10.1111/jam.12702 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative agent of 
      Johne's disease. Genotypic discrimination of MAP isolates is pivotal to 
      epidemiological studies requisite for revealing infection sources and disease 
      transmission. This study was undertaken to determine the genetic diversity of MAP 
      strains from diverse sources. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five hundred and sixty-nine 
      MAP isolates were collected during an 8-year period from nine animal species, 
      originating from seven European countries, including the whole geographic region 
      of Hungary. Isolates were classified into cattle type and sheep type, and 515 
      strains were included in mycobacterial interspersed repetitive 
      units-variable-number tandem repeat analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The same genotype was 
      found in different host species cohabiting on the same property, demonstrating 
      interspecies transmission. Detecting identical patterns in numerous related 
      animals underlines the importance of vertical transmission. The revealed 15 
      genotypes expose relatively low strain diversity and indicate the need of an 
      improved typing system that provides higher resolution in the case of this 
      subspecies. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our results demonstrate the 
      circulation and transmission of different MAP strain types among individuals, 
      herds and even wildlife reservoirs in Hungary and other European countries; 
      correlation between production type or breed and MAP genotype is hypothesized.

TI  - Patient-activated controlled expansion for breast reconstruction using controlled 
      carbon dioxide inflation: confirmation of a feasibility study.
PG  - 503e-511e
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0000000000000551 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women with breast cancer or those at high risk of developing breast 
      cancer because of familial history of the disease or genetic mutations are 
      frequently indicated for therapeutic or prophylactic mastectomy. Prosthetic 
      reconstruction of the breast with placement of tissue expanders followed by 
      implants offers favorable aesthetic and psychological results while adding only 
      minimal additional surgical intervention. This study describes the confirmatory 
      phase of an earlier feasibility trial that involved seven women who successfully 
      underwent patient-activated controlled expansion for breast reconstruction with 
      10 AeroForm patient-controlled tissue expanders. METHODS: A prospective, 
      open-label, single-arm, single-surgeon confirmatory study in Perth, Australia, 
      evaluated outcomes of two-stage breast reconstruction using the investigational 
      device. Each subject administered a preset 10-cc dose of carbon dioxide gas using 
      a remote dosage controller, three times each day, with a 3-hour lockout between 
      doses until full expansion was achieved. RESULTS: Thirty-three women with breast 
      cancer, family history, or predisposition because of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene 
      mutation underwent pedicled latissimus dorsi flap procedures with placement of 61 
      carbon dioxide-based tissue expanders. The mean number of days for subjects to 
      achieve desired expansion was 17 +/- 5. Operating the dosage controller was 
      described by the surgeon as very easy in 94 percent of the cases and by 97 
      percent of the subjects. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: 
      This study confirms that the AeroForm breast tissue expander has demonstrated the 
      ability to provide, relative to saline expanders, a needle-free, 
      patient-controlled, convenient, and time-saving method of tissue expansion.

TI  - A Chinese medicine formula Gegen Qinlian decoction suppresses expansion of human 
      renal carcinoma with inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-2.
PG  - 75-85
LID - 10.1177/1534735414550036 [doi]
AB  - AIM OF STUDY: Gegen Qinlian decoction (GQLD) is an ancient Chinese medicine 
      formula for treating diseases with inner heat. The aim of this study is to 
      investigate the antitumor effect of GQLD in human renal carcinoma cell (RCC) and 
      its possible mechanism. METHOD: High-performance liquid chromatography was used 
      to identify and quantify active compounds in GQLD. Inhibition of tumor growth was 
      determined by xenograft model. Cell viability on treatment with the decoction was 
      determined by MTT assay; quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and 
      immunoblotting were used to determine gene and protein expression; matrix 
      metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity was detected by gelatin zymography and in 
      vitro enzymatic reaction assay. RESULTS: Thirteen major peaks were detected in 
      the decoction, 8 of which were identified as berberine, baicalin and baicalein, 
      pueranin, daizidin, liquiritin, wogonoside, and wogonin. GQLD exhibited potent 
      inhibition on xenografted expansion of RCC cells. Interestingly, GQLD treatment 
      did not induce cell death to RCC cells, but blocked the neoangiogenesis in 
      xenografted RCC tumor. Particularly, we found that GQLD significantly inhibited 
      MMP-2 in RCC cells, which was involved as a critical factor in avascular growth 
      of RCC. GQLD directly suppressed the enzyme activity of MMP-2. Radix Scutellariae 
      was the major herbal component that contributed to the potent inhibition of 
      MMP-2. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study provide experimental evidence of 
      the inhibition of expansion and neoangiogenesis of renal carcinoma by Chinese 
      medicine formula GQLD with involvement of MMP-2 suppression.

TI  - Experience in IVIg therapy for selected women with recurrent reproductive failure 
      and NK cell expansion.
PG  - 458-66
LID - 10.1111/aji.12217 [doi]
AB  - PROBLEM: Recurrent reproductive failure (RRF) has been associated with expansion 
      of circulating NK cells, key cells for maternal tolerance, decidual 
      vasculogenesis and embryo growth. This study reports our experience in 
      intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy of a large cohort of women with RRF 
      with expanded circulating NK and/or NKT-like cells (blood NKT cells are a 
      heterogeneous subset of T cells that share properties of both T cells and NK 
      cells). METHOD OF STUDY: Observational study of RRF women with NK or NKT-like 
      expansion (>12% or 10% cutoff levels of total lymphocytes, respectively), treated 
      with IVIg for the next gestation. RESULTS: By multivariant logistic regression 
      analysis after adjusting for age, NK cells subsets and other therapies, IVIg 
      significantly improved the live birth rate to 96.3% in women with recurrent 
      miscarriage (RM) compared with 30.6% in case not receiving IVIg (P < 0.0001). In 
      women with recurrent implantation failure (RIF), in comparison with women not 
      receiving IVIg, treatment increased the pregnancy rate from 26.2 to 93.8% 
      (P </= 0.0001) and the live birth rate from 17.9 to 80.0% in RIF (P </= 0.0001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Immunomodulation with IVIg in our selected group of RRF patients 
      with immunologic alterations enhanced clinical pregnancy and live birth rates. 
      Our results may facilitate the design of future clinical trials of IVIg in this 
      pathology.

TI  - Multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis of Salmonella enterica 
      subsp. enterica serovar Dublin.
PG  - 1044-54
LID - 10.1111/jam.12441 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Salmonella serovar Dublin causes disease in cattle and leads to 
      considerable production losses. In humans, severe invasive disease and high 
      mortality rates are reported. The presently available typing methods provide 
      insufficient discrimination within Salm. Dublin for epidemiological 
      investigations. In this study, we developed a multiple-locus variable-number 
      tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) scheme for high discriminatory typing of Salm. 
      Dublin. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nine loci of variable number of tandem repeats 
      (VNTRs) were evaluated based on a panel of 40 diverse isolates. The four most 
      discriminative VNTRs were selected for further MLVA analysis. The discriminatory 
      power was evaluated on 272 veterinary and human isolates plus 29 outbreak-related 
      isolates. MLVA divided the 272 isolates into 103 types and successfully 
      identified isolates from an epidemiologically confirmed outbreak. VNTRs exhibited 
      100% in vitro stability and contained only true repeats. The discriminatory power 
      of the MLVA was compared to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). When 
      analysing a subset of 106 isolates, MLVA obtained 60 types (index of diversity 
      (DI) of 0.97), while PFGE revealed 10 types (DI of 0.57). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      technique showed a significantly enhanced discriminatory power compared with the 
      current 'gold standard' PFGE. MLVA is a fast and low-cost method. SIGNIFICANCE 
      AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This MLVA method can be recommended to be used in 
      routine subtyping of isolates for outbreak investigations and disease 
      surveillance. The method may provide valuable additional information that can 
      improve the effectiveness of epidemiological investigations of Salm. Dublin 
      infections in patients as well as in the primary production and thereby 
      contribute to the efforts of reducing transmission of infection.

TI  - Expansion Open-door Laminoplasty With Foraminotomy Versus Anterior Cervical 
      Discectomy and Fusion for Coexisting Multilevel Cervical Myelopathy and 
      Unilateral Radiculopathy.
PG  - E21-7
LID - 10.1097/BSD.0000000000000074 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This was a clinical prospective study. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether 
      clinical and radiologic outcomes differ between expansion open-door laminoplasty 
      with foraminotomy (EOLF) and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) in 
      the treatment of coexisting multilevel cervical myelopathy and unilateral 
      radiculopathy (CMUR). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: No reports to date have 
      compared clinical outcomes between anterior and posterior decompression for CMUR. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively performed ACDF (n=59) in 2004, 2006, and 
      2008 and EOLF (n=62) in 2005, 2007, and 2009. The Japanese Orthopedic Association 
      (JOA) score and recovery rate were evaluated. For radiographic evaluation, the 
      lordotic angle and range of motion at C2-C7 were investigated. RESULTS: Only 110 
      patients could be followed for >3 years (EOLF/ACDF: 56/54; follow-up rate, 
      90.9%). Demographics were similar between the 2 groups. Compared with ACDF, in 
      EOLF group there were shorter operating time (144 vs. 178 min), less bleeding 
      (175 vs. 192 mL), and fewer complications (P<0.05). Results of JOA score and 
      recovery rate, at 3-year postoperative follow-up, showed no statistical 
      difference for the 2 groups. Cervical lordosis of ACDF increased from 13.7 to 
      16.2 degrees, whereas that of EOLF group decreased from 14.6 to 13.3 degrees 
      (P<0.05). The percentage of range of motion declined in the 2 groups (ACDF/EOLF), 
      57.4% versus 74.7% (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The 2 surgical procedures have similar 
      clinical effects in treating multisegmental CMUR. However, the EOLF group 
      demonstrated shorter operative time, less blood loss, and fewer complications; 
      therefore, it proved to be a more effective and safer method.

TI  - A comparison of skin expansion and contraction between one expander and two 
      expanders: a preliminary study.
PG  - 1202-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the difference between the skin expansion 
      and contraction rates for an expanded flap with one versus two expanders. 
      METHODS: The study cohort comprised 24 cases of two overlapping expanders and 15 
      cases of a single implanted expander involving 22 patients. The method of 
      "wet-cloth sampling" was applied to measure the expanded flap area and the 
      initial unexpanded area and to calculate the skin expansion rate. Two points 5 cm 
      apart in the center of the expanded flap were selected before the second surgical 
      stage. After removal of the expander, the distance between the two fixed points 
      was measured and recorded. The contraction rate of the expanded flap then was 
      calculated. RESULTS: During the same period of expansion in the two groups (p = 
      0.06, >0.01), the skin expansion rate was 3.5 +/- 0.9 % in the group with two 
      overlapping expanders and 2.6 +/- 0.6 % in the control group. The difference 
      between the two groups was statistically significant (p = 0.002, <0.05). The 
      instantly expanded flap contraction rates were 30.3 +/- 0.8 and 32.3 +/- 0.9 %, 
      respectively for the two groups, and the difference was not statistically 
      significant (p = 0.47, >0.05). We fitted a linear regression model that was Y = 
      0.533 - 0.003X, where Y was the contraction rate of the expanded flap and X was 
      the period of expansion. The contraction rate of the expanded flap was negatively 
      correlated with the period of expansion. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the 
      traditional method of implanting a single expander, the new method of overlapping 
      two expanders in a single cavity increased the skin expansion rate. The instantly 
      expanded flap contraction rate did not differ significantly between the two 
      groups, so the amount of expanded skin area absolutely increased. The clinical 
      application of the new method is worth promoting. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE V: This

TI  - GPIb VNTR C/C genotype may predict embolic events in infective endocarditis.
PG  - 133-41
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Infective endocarditis (IE) is frequently 
      complicated by septic embolism, a need for valve replacement, and death. The 
      development of these complications is associated with the presence, size and 
      mobility of cardiac vegetations, which may form as a result of bacterium-platelet 
      interactions mediated by the platelet glycoprotein GPIb receptor. Variable number 
      tandem repeat (VNTR) and single nucleotide polymorphisms of the gene encoding the 
      GPIb receptor have been described, but their correlation with platelet function, 
      development of vegetations and complications of IE is unknown. METHODS: The GPIb 
      Kozak T/C, VNTR and human platelet antigen-2a/2b (HPA-2a/2b) genotype of healthy 
      volunteers (n = 156) and patients with IE (n = 35) was determined, and the 
      influence of these polymorphisms on Staphylococcus aureus-induced platelet 
      aggregation in vitro, platelet activation in vivo and clinical outcome in IE was 
      then investigated. RESULTS: The GPIb VNTR C/C genotype was associated with an 
      increased risk of embolism (p = 0.039), with no influence on platelet activation 
      or aggregation, vegetation characteristics or mortality (p > 0.05 for all). The 
      GPIb Kozak T/C and HPA-2a/2b polymorphisms did not influence the development of 
      complications in patients with IE (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of 
      these exploratory studies suggest that the GPIb VNTR C/C genotype may predict the 
      development of septic emboli in patients with IE. This hypothesis should be 
      analyzed in larger studies and, if confirmed, would represent an important 
      clinical finding, as it implies that early surgery in patients with the GPIb VNTR 
      C/C genotype could reduce morbidity and mortality in IE.

TI  - Abdominoplasty revision using tissue expansion.
PG  - 538-40
LID - 10.1007/s00266-013-0104-6 [doi]
AB  - Postoperative revision after abdominoplasty may be necessary at times to improve 
      contour, remove asymmetries, revise the umbilicus, or improve the scar. This 
      report describes the case of an abdominoplasty performed outside the United 
      States that resulted in an inappropriately high and unattractive scar with an 
      elevated pubic hairline. The patient presented to our clinic 2 years after her 
      initial surgery, and a scar-lowering procedure was performed with the assistance 
      of tissue expansion. The reconstructive effort was staged over a period of 4 
      months, with an initial procedure to repair several hernias, bury the umbilicus, 
      and place a tissue expander. Over several months, 3.5 L of expansion was 
      performed. During a subsequent surgery, the tissue expander was removed, and the 
      scar was successfully lowered and improved. The healing was uneventful, and the 
      patient was satisfied with the outcome. The final result is exhibited in 1-month 
      follow-up photographs. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE V: This journal requires that authors

TI  - Mixed donor chimerism in non-malignant haematological diseases after allogeneic 
      bone marrow transplantation.
PG  - 765-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of mixed donor chimerism in patients of 
      non-malignant haematological diseases after allogeneic bone marrow transplant. 
      STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional, observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF 
      STUDY: Department of Haematology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP), 
      Rawalpindi, from July 2010 to June 2011. METHODOLOGY: Donor chimerism was 
      assessed in patients of aplastic anaemia and beta-thalassaemia major who 
      underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Peripheral blood samples 
      were used to assess chimerism status by analysis of short tandem repeats (STR). 
      In patients where pre-transplant blood sample was not available, swab of buccal 
      mucosa was used for pre-transplant STR profile. A standard set of primers for STR 
      markers were used and the amplified DNA was resolved by gel electrophoresis and 
      stained with silver nitrate. The percentage of donor origin DNA was estimated by 
      densitometer. RESULTS: Out of 84 patients, 52 (62%) were males, while 32 (38%) 
      were females. In patients of beta-thalassaemia major, 31 (62%) developed mixed 
      donor chimerism (MC), 13 (26%) developed complete donor chimerism (CC) and 6 
      (12%) had graft failure. In aplastic anaemia, 17 patients (50%) achieved MC, 13 
      (38.2%) had CC and 4 (11.8%) developed graft failure. The combined frequency of 
      mixed donor chimerism for both the diseases was 58.3%. D3S1358 was the most 
      informative STR marker in these patients. CONCLUSION: Majority of the studied 
      patients developed mixed donor chimerism following bone marrow transplantation, 
      whereas only a minor percentage of the patients had graft failure. Analysis of 
      D3S1358 was the most informative in assessing donor chimerism in patients who 
      underwent BMT.

TI  - The combination of polyalanine expansion mutation and a novel missense 
      substitution in transcription factor FOXL2 leads to different ovarian phenotypes 
      in blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) patients.
PG  - 3347-57

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: What are the implications of multiple alterations of the forkhead 
      box L2 (FOXL2) gene in blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome 
      (BPES) patients? SUMMARY ANSWER: A multi-mutation of FOXL2, consisting of the 
      expansion of the polyalanine tract from 14 to 24 residues (FOXL2-Ala24), an novel 
      Y186C substitution from c.557A>G, and a synonymous variant (c.505G>A), had a 
      cumulative effect on ovarian phenotypes in BPES patients. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: 
      Mutations in FOXL2, a gene encoding a forkhead transcription factor cause BPES. 
      Overall, the expansion of the polyalanine tract of FOXL2 from 14 to 24 residues 
      (FOXL2-Ala24) accounts for 30% of intragenic mutations. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, 
      DURATION: In this study, patients from seven BPES families and six sporadic cases 
      were included. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We conducted an 
      extensive clinical, hormonal and functional study in 20 patients carrying the 
      expansion of the polyalanine tract of FOXL2 associated with BPES. A 
      multi-mutation of FOXL2 was detected in one BPES family that showed more severe 
      BPES symptoms. Subcellular localization and transactivation studies were 
      performed for the constructs of FOXL2-Ala24, Y186C and FOXL2-Ala24-Y186C. MAIN 
      RESULTS: We described the first multi-mutation of FOXL2 (c. [672_701dup30; 
      557A>G]) that leads to the polyalanine expansion of +10 residues (FOXL2-Ala24) 
      combined with an Y186C substitution and a synonymous variant in a Chinese BPES 
      family. This multi-mutation genotype was associated with more serious BPES 
      clinical manifestations and the development of esotropia in the right eye. In in 
      vitro studies, the multi-mutation affected the function of FOKL2 on the StAR 
      promoter and DK3, and induced more aggressive aggregation and mislocalization of 
      FOXL2 protein. The synonymous variant, while not affecting amino acid coding, 
      causes a change in the RNA stem-loop structure. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: 
      The multi-mutation of FOXL2 was detected in one BPES family and it needs to be 
      validated further by more BPES subjects. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The 
      results of our study contribute new insights into the research field of BPES 
      caused by the multi-mutation of FOXL2. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: This 
      study was supported by Shanghai Leading Academic Discipline Project (Grant number 
      S30205) and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine Doctor Innovation 
      Fund (Grant number 201131). The authors have no competing interests to declare.

TI  - Effect of lamina open angles in expansion open-door laminoplasty on the clinical 
      results in treating cervical spondylotic myelopathy.
PG  - 89-94
LID - 10.1097/BSD.0b013e3182695295 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the 
      relation of the efficacy and clinical results of expansion open-door laminoplasty 
      (EOLP) with different angles in lamina open-door. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: 
      EOLP is currently the most widely adopted surgical treatment for cervical 
      spondylotic myelopathy. Although many long-term clinical follow-up studies have 
      reported that most patients recover satisfactorily after EOLP, there have been 
      numerous reports regarding postoperative complications, such as stubborn axial 
      symptoms (AS) and C5 palsy. The lamina open-door angles in EOLP play a decisive 
      role in determining the openness of the door that affects clinical outcomes. 
      Nonetheless, no thorough studies on different angles in EOLP have been published. 
      METHOD: A total of 198 cervical spondylotic myelopathy patients who underwent 
      posterior cervical EOLP and at least 24 months follow-up treatment between July 
      2006 and January 2009 were selected as case studies. Among the 198 cases used, 
      there were 39 double-segment cases with the location being C3-C5 in 11 cases and 
      C4-C6 in 28 cases, 97 three-segments (C4-C7) and 62 four segments (C3-C7). All of 
      the patients underwent x-ray, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging 
      images for evaluation of the cervical spine. According to different opening 
      angles, measured by computed tomography scan after operation 1 week, the patients 
      were divided into 2 groups, group A (>30 degrees, 76 patients including 44 males 
      and 32 females) and group B (15-30 degrees, 122 patients including 71 males and 
      51 females). All patients were followed up for over 24 months, clinical results 
      including operative duration, intraoperative bleeding volume, postoperative 
      complications, C2-C7 Cobb angle, cervical curvature index (CI), range of motion 
      (ROM), and values after the spinal cord backward shift were analyzed 
      statistically, evaluating the neurological function at final follow-up and 
      calculating the improvement rate of nerve function recovery. RESULTS: There was 
      no statistically significant difference (P>0.05) between the 2 groups in the 
      following areas: the Japanese Orthopedic Association scores, C2-C7 Cobb angle, 
      cervical CI, and ROM. In addition, operative duration and intraoperative bleeding 
      volume between A group and B group showed no significant differences (P>0.05). 
      After surgery, 51 patients (67.1%) in group A had AS, 8 patients (10.4%) had C5 
      palsy, and 1 patient had mild cervical kyphosis. Whereas postoperatively group B 
      contained 37 cases (10.5%) with AS, 3 (2.4%) with C5 palsy, and in 4 cases 
      (3.28%) the lamina open-door had reclosed. The rate of patients with AS and C5 
      palsy in group A was higher than group B. The incidence of postoperative 
      complications between the 2 groups have a significant difference (P<0.05). The 
      rate of improvement of Japanese Orthopedic Association scores in last follow-up 
      between group A and group B did not reach statistical significance (P>0.05). At 
      the 1-month follow-up the range of the value of spinal cord backward shift was 
      0-7.95 mm with the average being 2.41+/-0.46 mm. C2-C7 Cobb angle, CI, and ROM 
      between the 2 groups revealed no statistical significance (P>0.05). ROM 
      comparisons preoperatively and postoperatively between the 2 groups were 
      significantly different (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In different angles of lamina 
      open-door, the improvement rate of neurological function after surgery had no 
      statistically significant difference between 2 groups. When the open-door angle 
      is maintained between 15 and 30 degrees, it can reduce the incidence of C5 palsy 
      in the hinge side and AS, but we should prevent reclosure of the lamina 
      open-door.

TI  - Is expansion thoracoplasty a safe procedure for mobility and growth potential of 
      the spine? Spontaneous fusion after multiple chest distractions in young 
      children.
PG  - 483-9
LID - 10.1097/BPO.0b013e318257d3a9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expansion thoracoplasty (ET) is claimed to be a spine-sparing 
      procedure because of the fact that the spine is not exposed directly and 
      intervention toward the spinal column is not performed. It is also recommended in 
      cases of primary spine deformities without rib fusion/aplasia and when the 
      primary problem is not in the thorax itself. The aim of this study was to report 
      spontaneous spinal fusion after multiple thoracic distractions in patients with 
      congenital thoracospinal deformities who have undergone ET in early childhood. 
      METHODS: In our clinic, between May 2003 and March 2010, ET treatment was started 
      in 11 patients who had congenital spinal deformity along with thoracic asymmetry 
      due to fused ribs. The lengthening procedures for 6 of them are still ongoing. 
      This study includes 5 of these patients who had undergone 3-dimensional computed 
      tomography (3D-CT) scans. Four of these patients underwent a CT scan as part of 
      the graduation protocol and 1 was ordered a 3D-CT because a newly formed bony 
      fusion of the ribs was observed in a lengthening procedure. RESULTS: The mean age 
      of the patients (4 F, 1 M) was 4.2 years (range, 2 to 8 y) at the time of the 
      index operation. The mean number of lengthening procedures was 9.4 (range, 7 to 
      13). The mean follow-up period was 73 months (range, 60 to 96 mo). All 5 patients 
      in the latest follow-up were evaluated by x-ray and 3D-CT scans of the whole 
      spine. The CT scans confirmed spontaneous spinal fusion in the thoracic spine. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that distraction-based, growth-friendly 
      instrumentations are not risk-free for spinal health and motion, even when the 
      instrumentation is not primarily on the spine. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.

TI  - Changes in frontal morphology after single-stage open posterior-middle vault 
      expansion for sagittal craniosynostosis.
PG  - 504-516
LID - 10.1097/PRS.0b013e31823aec1d [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is controversy regarding whether the frontal bossing associated 
      with sagittal synostosis requires direct surgical correction or spontaneously 
      remodels after isolated posterior cranial expansion. The authors retrospectively 
      measured changes in frontal bone morphology in patients with isolated sagittal 
      synostosis 2 years after open posterior and midvault cranial expansion and 
      compared these changes with those occurring in age-comparable healthy control 
      groups. METHODS: Forty-three patients age 1 year or younger (mean, 6 months) with 
      sagittal synostosis underwent computed tomography scan digital analysis 
      immediately after and 2 years after posterior-middle cranial vault expansion. 
      Quantitative angular and linear measures were taken along the midsagittal and 
      axial planes to capture both aspects of frontal bossing. The change in values 
      over the 2 years were compared with healthy controls with normal computed 
      tomography scans taken to rule out head trauma. RESULTS: All measures indicative 
      of frontal bossing decreased significantly from the time of posterior-middle 
      vault expansion to 2 years postoperatively. Whereas the majority of patients at 
      time of the operation had frontal bossing measures greater than two standard 
      deviations outside the age-comparable control mean, almost all patients were 
      within two standard deviations of the norm 2 years later. Lateral forehead 
      bossing and anterior cranial growth was greater the older the patient was at the 
      time of the operation, suggesting that the more time that passed before the 
      operation, the more compensatory anterior fossa growth occurred. Central forehead 
      position relative to the anterior cranial base was greatest in the younger 
      patients at the time of operation, suggesting that a central forehead bulge was 
      an early compensatory response to premature sagittal fusion. CONCLUSIONS: As a 
      group, patients with sagittal synostosis start to normalize their forehead 
      morphology within 2 years if an isolated posterior operation is performed at 1 
      year of age or younger, and this occurs by a combination of restriction of growth 
      and reduction relative to patients without synostosis. This protocol decreases 
      the risks of intraoperative positioning, forehead contour deformities, and 
      two-stage operations. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, III.

TI  - Brazilian green propolis and its constituent, Artepillin C inhibits allogeneic 
      activated human CD4 T cells expansion and activation.
PG  - 463-71
LID - 10.1016/j.jep.2011.09.031 [doi]
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Propolis has long been used as a popular folk 
      medicine by various ethnic groups due to its wide spectrum of alleged biological 
      and pharmaceutical properties including anti-microbial, anti-cancer and 
      anti-inflammatory functions. All these can be linked to the modulation of immune 
      function. Therefore, it will be relevant for us to find out whether there is any 
      novel compound that can account for such action and the mechanism involved. AIM 
      OF THE STUDY: We investigated the immune modulating effect of Brazilian green 
      propolis (PBrazil) and its constituent Artepillin C (Art-C) by using mixed 
      leukocytes reaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cytotoxic effect of Art-C on 
      non-tumorigenic human liver cell line miHA and non-tumorigenic human kidney cell 
      line HK-2 as well as human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were 
      measured by XTT cell proliferation assay. The effect of PBrazil and Art-C on T 
      cell proliferation and activation were determined by using carboxyfluorescein 
      succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and by CD25 expression, respectively. Cytokines 
      including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukins 
      such as IL-2, IL-17 were measured by intracellular cytokine staining and IL-10 
      was measured by ELISA. The effect of PBrazil and Art-C on regulatory T cells 
      (Treg) induction was determined by the Foxp3 expression. The apoptotic effect of 
      these compounds on CFSE labeled alloreactive T cells was measured by using 
      Annexin V. RESULTS: Using mixed leukocytes reaction we demonstrated for the first 
      time that both Art-C and PBrazil significantly inhibited the alloreactive CD4 T 
      cell proliferation, activation, and suppressed the expressions of IL-2, IFN-gamma and 
      IL-17 in these alloreactive CD4 T cells. The inhibitions of Art-C and PBrazil on 
      CD4 T cells were not due to direct cytotoxic effect on PBMC or inducing 
      regulatory T cells differentiation. Both Art-C and PBrazil were found to 
      selectively induce apoptosis in proliferating T cells. The anti-proliferative 
      effect of Art-C and PBrazil were reversible and were also applied to the 
      activated T cells. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our results indicated that Art-C 
      and PBrazil can suppress alloreactive CD4 T cell responses in vitro, suggesting 
      that Art-C could be used as a potential immunosuppressant, either solely or as 
      adjunct agent in treating graft versus host disease.

AB  - This feasibility study represents the first report of a new carbon dioxide-based 
      tissue expander designed to allow gradual controlled expansion and to eliminate 
      the need for percutaneous injections. Seven patients underwent implantation with 
      a total of 10 (three bilateral) tissue expanders. After intraoperative filling by 
      the surgeon and wound healing, small doses of carbon dioxide were administered on 
      a daily basis by the patient by means of a hand-held dosage controller leading to 
      gradual, incremental expansion. Rapid expansion during the active dosing phase 
      and flexibility to meet individual patient needs during expansion were 
      demonstrated with all subjects. These patients achieved full expansion in an 
      average of 15 days. All seven patients were able to use the device safely and 
      with ease at home, leading to successful tissue expansion and permanent breast 
      reconstruction. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.

AB  - AIMS: To compare 167 Norwegian human and nonhuman Escherichia coli O157:H7/NM 
      (nonmotile) isolates with respect to an A/T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
      in the tir gene and to detect specific SNPs that differentiate STEC O157 into 
      distinct virulence clades (1-3 and 8). METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a 
      multiplex PCR followed by single base sequencing for detection of the SNPs, and 
      examined the association among SNP genotype, virulence profile (stx and eae 
      status), multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) profile and 
      clinical outcome. We found an over-representation of the T allele among human 
      strains compared to nonhuman strains, including 5/6 haemolytic-uraemic syndrome 
      cases. Fourteen strains belonged to clade 8, followed by two clade 2 strains. No 
      clade 1 nor 3 isolates were observed. stx1 in combination with either 
      stx2(EDL933) or stx2c were frequently observed among human strains, whereas stx2c 
      was dominating in nonhuman strains. MLVA indicated that only single cases or 
      small outbreaks with E. coli O157 have been observed in Norway through the years 
      1993-2008. CONCLUSION: We observed that the tir-255 A/T SNP and the stx status 
      were different between human and nonhuman O157 strains. No major outbreaks were 
      observed, and only a few strains were differentiated into the virulence clades 2 
      and 8. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The detection of virulence 
      clade-specific SNPs enables the rapid designation of virulent E. coli O157 
      strains, especially in outbreak situations.

TI  - Esophageal rupture in a child after vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib 
      expansion thoracoplasty: first report of a rare complication.
PG  - E669-72
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181f92c1c [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Case report and clinical discussion. OBJECTIVE: To illustrate the 
      significance of esophageal rupture as a rare complication after expansion 
      thoracoplasty with implementation of a vertical expandable prosthetic titanium 
      rib (VEPTR). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Chest wall deformities and secondary 
      scoliosis are rare complications after a repair operation for esophageal atresia. 
      The new technique of VEPTR expansion thoracoplasty directly treats the chest wall 
      deformity and indirectly corrects the scoliosis. We describe a patient with an 
      esophageal rupture after VEPTR expansion thoracoplasty. METHODS: We report the 
      case of an 11-year-old boy who developed a progressive scoliosis caused by fused 
      ribs after multiple reoperations for esophageal atresia. The patient was treated 
      operatively by an expansion thoracoplasty via an opening wedge thoracostomy with 
      implementation of two VEPTRs. RESULTS: After surgery, the patient developed a 
      respiratory insufficiency because of rupture of the esophagus. The complication 
      was treated conservatively. A second operation was needed to remove an infected 
      VEPTR. The patient fully recovered after this severe complication. CONCLUSION: To 
      our knowledge, this is the first report of esophageal rupture after VEPTR 
      expansion thoracoplasty. This promising new technique treats scoliosis in 
      patients with severe chest wall deformities. When a patient presents with fused 
      ribs and there is a history of esophageal atresia, we should keep in mind that 
      the esophagus is at risk of rupturing during the scoliosis correcting procedure.

TI  - Plate-only open door laminoplasty maintains stable spinal canal expansion with 
      high rates of hinge union and no plate failures.
PG  - 9-14

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical series. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of 
      plate-only laminoplasty to achieve stable laminar arch reconstruction and to 
      determine the rate and time course with which bony healing occurs in such 
      constructs. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Reconstruction of a stable laminar arch 
      with sufficient room for the decompressed spinal cord is a desired goal when 
      performing cervical laminoplasty for myelopathy. Traditional forms of 
      laminoplasty fixation, such as sutures, bone struts, and ceramic spacers, may be 
      associated with complications including loss of fixation, dislodgement with 
      neurologic compromise, and premature laminoplasty closure. Plates, in contrast, 
      provide more rigid fixation. Plate-only laminoplasty is gaining popularity as a 
      method of laminoplasty fixation, but there is little data on its effectiveness. 
      METHODS: Fifty-four patients who underwent open door laminoplasty for cervical 
      myelopathy and had available postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans formed 
      the basis of this study. In all cases, a 4-mm round burr was used to create the 
      hinge at the junction of the lateral mass and lamina by completely removing the 
      dorsal cortex and thinning the ventral cortex until a greenstick deformation of 
      the hinge could be produced. Laminoplasty plates were used as the sole method of 
      fixation. No supplemental bone graft struts were used on the plated side, and the 
      hinge side was not bone grafted. Axial CT scans obtained at 3, 6, and 12 months 
      postoperatively were assessed for plate complications and bony healing of the 
      hinge. RESULTS: No plate failures, dislodgements, or premature closures occurred 
      in any of the levels at any time postoperatively. Computed tomography scan review 
      demonstrated that 55% of levels were healed at 3 months, 77% at 6 months, and 93% 
      at 12 months. At each timepoint, C6 and C7 had the highest hinge healing rates. 
      Laminar screw backout was seen in 5/217 (2.3%) of levels, but was not associated 
      with plate dislodgement, laminoplasty closure, or neurologic consequences, and 
      did not occur in any case in which 2 laminar screws had been placed. CONCLUSION: 
      Plate-only laminoplasty provided stable reconstruction of an expanded laminar 
      arch with no failures, dislodgements, adverse neurologic consequences, or 
      premature closures in 217 levels. Ninety-three percent of hinges demonstrated 
      radiographic union at 12 months, and even those that did not heal by CT scan 
      criteria maintained patent expansion of the spinal canal without adverse 
      neurologic consequences. Supplemental bone graft does not appear necessary when 
      plated laminoplasty is performed.

      characterize Salmonella Typhimurium DT41 broiler breeder infections.
PG  - 2032-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2010.04833.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To characterize isolates of Salmonella Typhimurium DT41 obtained from 
      infected flocks of broiler breeders by multiple-locus variable-number 
      tandem-repeats analysis (MLVA) and compare results with a diverse strain 
      collection from Germany and United Kingdom and isolates from Danish patients. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 102 isolates of Salm. Typhimurium phage type DT41 
      were MLVA typed. MLVA typing showed 4, 12, 25, 9 and 8 different alleles at the 
      five MLVA loci 9, 5, 6, 10 and 3, respectively. A dendrogram based on MLVA types 
      was constructed, and one large group, nine minor groups and 29 more unrelated 
      MLVA types were obtained. The major group included 20 of the 30 human isolates. 
      Isolates obtained from broiler breeders demonstrated major diversity, indicating 
      the existence of several independent introductions of DT41 at farm level. When 
      comparison was made to isolates included from Germany and England, DT41 seems to 
      be ubiquitous in the wild fauna which might represent a risk factor for poultry. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Transmission from Danish broilers to humans was not demonstrated, 
      neither was the transmission from rearing farms to broiler breeder farms. Sources 
      of infection at broiler breeder farm level remained unidentified. SIGNIFICANCE 
      AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Major diversity was demonstrated for DT41 MLVA types. A 
      persisting problem with infection of broiler breeder flocks with DT41 was not 
      reflected in broiler flocks originating from these flocks.

      to conservative treatment of lumbar herniated nucleus pulposus.
PG  - 1527-31
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181e4efb6 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship 
      between gene polymorphism in interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) and 
      response to conservative treatment of lumbar herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP). 
      SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There had been several studies on IL1RN polymorphism 
      related with incidence of disc degeneration or back pain but, there had been no 
      report on clinical features of lumbar HNP. METHODS: We analyzed the variable 
      number tandem repeat polymorphism of IL1RN genes in 54 single level 
      subligamentous extruded lumbar HNP patients and compared allele frequency and 
      incidence of heterozygote with 227 healthy adult controls. Within HNP group, we 
      compared 2 groups; surgery group and conservative treatment group according to 
      response to conservative treatment. RESULTS: The prevalence of A1 (odd ratio = 
      0.45, P = 0.0009) and A3 (odd ratio = 3.86, P = 0.0006) was significantly higher 
      in HNP group than control group. The allele frequency of A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 
      were 84.2:84.6, 7.3:15.4, 8.5:0, 0:0, 0:0, respectively, in surgical and 
      conservative treatment group. The allele frequency for A3 was found significantly 
      higher in the surgery group than in the conservative treatment group. CONCLUSION: 
      These results suggest that a high allele prevalence of A3 contribute to the 
      clinical progression and the response to conservative treatment for lumbar HNP. 
      IL1RN gene polymorphism may affect the clinical course of lumbar HNP.

TI  - Association between the expression of aggrecan and the distribution of aggrecan 
      gene variable number of tandem repeats with symptomatic lumbar disc herniation in 
      Chinese Han of Northern China.
PG  - 1371-6
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181c4e022 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between 
      the expression of aggrecan and the aggrecan gene variable number of tandem 
      repeats (VNTR) polymorphism with symptomatic lumbar disc herniation (LDH) in 
      Chinese Han of Northern China. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Aggrecan fragments 
      have been found in human degenerated discs, and an association between the 
      aggrecan VNTR polymorphism and intervertebral disc degeneration has been 
      previously reported in middle-aged Finnish men. However, the relationship between 
      the munity of symptomatic LDH with the expression of aggrecan and aggrecan gene 
      VNTR has not been well studied. METHODS: The disease group consisted of 70 
      patients already diagnosed with symptomatic LDH. The control group consisted of 
      14 patients restricted to spinal trauma and 113 healthy blood donors without 
      symptoms of LDH who were not diagnosed with LDH. Disc tissue samples were 
      obtained from surgical operations, and blood samples were donated from all 
      participants. The aggrecan expression in isolated tissues was assessed by Western 
      blot using specific antibodies. The aggrecan gene VNTR region was analyzed by 
      polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The aggrecan expression positive rate of 
      control group was statistically and significantly higher (P < 0.001) than that of 
      the disease group. Moreover, there was a statistically significant higher 
      frequency of allele 25 or allele 21 in disease group compared with controls 
      (P(A25) = 0.003416 and P(A21) = 0.000716). Compared with the participants with 2 
      alleles > 25 repeats, subjects with 1 or 2 alleles < or = 25 repeats 
      statistically and significantly overrepresented the disease group without the 
      expression of aggrecan (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest a relation 
      between aggrecan and symptomatic LDH, where symptomatic LDH has a lower tendency 
      of allele repeats. In addition, this study observed an association between the 
      distribution of aggrecan gene VNTR polymorphism and the expression of aggrecan in 
      symptomatic LDH.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze solitary bone fragments from the uterine cavity through DNA 
      genotyping, thus elucidating whether they originate from metaplasia, from 
      previous abortion, or both. METHODS: We conducted a case series study on 14 
      patients, of whom eight yielded bone DNA. The patients selected had 
      histopathologic diagnoses of bone fragments inside the uterine cavity or 
      previously removed samples available for analysis. We extracted DNA from blood 
      and bone fragments. To identify the bone tissue origin, these materials were 
      genotyped using polymerase chain reactions for DNA loci. Six mini short tandem 
      repeat loci frequently used for human tissue identification were analyzed using 
      automated sequencing. RESULTS: Among these eight patients, blood and tissue 
      samples from the same individual produced exactly the same pair of alleles for 
      all six loci. This indicated that the DNA profile was completely the same for the 
      bone samples and the mother's blood (95% confidence interval 63-100%), thus 
      confirming that the DNA had the same origin and that these were cases of 
      metaplasia. CONCLUSION: In all of the eight cases, bone formation was caused by 
      osseous metaplasia, because the DNA in the bone fragment and in the patient's 
      blood was identical. Although all of the women had histories of previous 
      abortion, no difference in DNA was detected in the bone tissue in any of the 
      cases, as would be expected if abortion had occurred. This result was completely 
      unexpected, differing greatly from what the literature suggests. LEVEL OF

TI  - Expansion thoracoplasty improves respiratory function in a rabbit model of 
      postnatal pulmonary hypoplasia: a pilot study.
PG  - 153-61
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181c4b8c7 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Using a rabbit model of postnatal pulmonary hypoplasia, we 
      investigated how expansion thoracoplasty affected growth of the spine and lungs. 
      OBJECTIVE: By constricting the hemithorax in a growing rabbit to create postnatal 
      pulmonary hypoplasia, we quantified how expansion thoracoplasty affects lung 
      volume, respiratory function, alveolar morphology, and spine growth. SUMMARY OF 
      BACKGROUND DATA: In children with thoracic insufficiency syndrome, expansion 
      thoracoplasty of the constricted hemithorax improves respiratory function and 
      controls scoliosis. We hypothesize that expansion thoracoplasty of the 
      constricted hemithorax improves pulmonary hypoplasia by allowing the lung to 
      expand, improving respiratory function and stimulating lung growth. METHODS: 
      Postnatal pulmonary hypoplasia and scoliosis were induced in 5-week old rabbits 
      by constricting left ribs 3 to 8. Expansion thoracoplasty through the fused ribs 
      was performed at 10 weeks. These were compared with Disease rabbits allowed to 
      grow with a constricted left hemithorax and Normal rabbits. Spine and thoracic 
      deformity, right and left lung volumes were measured on reconstructed 
      3-dimensional computed tomography images and functional residual capacity 
      measured by plethysmography. At maturity, lungs were excised and quantitative 
      histology performed to measure alveolar air fraction and surface density. 
      RESULTS: Expansion thoracoplasty of the constricted left hemithorax improved 
      scoliosis but increased left lung volumes only moderately compared with Disease 
      rabbits. For Disease and Thoracoplasty Treated rabbits, a compensatory increase 
      in the volume of the right lung maintained total lung volumes equivalent to 
      Normal. Alveolar air space fraction was greater in Disease rabbits, suggestive of 
      emphysema improved by expansion thoracoplasty. Capillaries adjacent to the 
      alveoli were prominent in Thoracoplasty Treated rabbits. CONCLUSION: Expansion 
      thoracoplasty reduces scoliosis and increases the volume of the constricted 
      hemithorax, but the relative increase in the ipsilateral lung volume is small 
      since compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral lung also occurred. Expansion 
      thoracoplasty may improve respiratory function by increasing alveolar capillaries 
      and preventing emphysematous changes.

TI  - Does expansion thoracoplasty improve the volume of the convex lung in a windswept 
      thorax?
PG  - 944-7
LID - 10.1097/BPO.0b013e3181c11977 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expansion thoracoplasty using the Vertical Expandable Prosthetic 
      Titanium Rib increases the measured height and volume of the concave hemi thorax, 
      but the effect on the convex, non-instrumented lung is unknown. The purpose of 
      this study was to measure changes in lung volume and density in the convex lung 
      after expansion thoracoplasty. METHODS: The volume and density of the lungs was 
      measured in 12 children with congenital scoliosis and fused ribs before and after 
      concave expansion thoracoplasty using serial computed tomography scans. RESULTS: 
      There were 8 boys and 4 girls with an average age of 6.4 years at initial 
      implant. The average length of follow-up was 17.5 months. All patients showed 
      increased total lung volumes by an average of 250 cc (range 24 to 795 cc). The 
      volume of the concave lung increased by an average of 55% and the lung density 
      decreased by an average of 6%. The volume of the convex lung increased by an 
      average of 60%, and the density decreased by an average of 7%. Nine of 12 
      patients showed improvement in density of the convex lung. DISCUSSION: These 
      findings suggest that concave expansion thoracoplasty increases overall lung 
      volume in children with congenital scoliosis and fused ribs as measured by 
      computed tomography scan. In addition, expansion thoracoplasty seems to have a 
      beneficial effect on the convex, non-operated hemi thorax. Decreases in measured 
      lung density suggest improved aeration of the lung, which may prove to be 
      beneficial to overall pulmonary function. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4 therapeutic 
      studies: case series.

AB  - AIMS: To screen for the globally spread cluster of Enterococcus faecium, clonal 
      complex 17 (CC17) and characterize the genetic profile of Swedish clinical Ent. 
      faecium isolates. METHODS: A total of 203 consecutive isolates collected from 
      2004 to 2007 from patients with bacteraemia in Sweden. All isolates were 
      genotyped using multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and 
      20 isolates representing different MLVA types (MT) were chosen for multilocus 
      sequence typing (MLST). Minimal inhibitory concentrations against clinically 
      relevant antibiotics were determined with agar dilution. Presence of the 
      virulence genes esp and hyl was investigated using PCR. RESULTS: A total of 65% 
      (n = 109) of all isolates belonged to MT-1, and the second most common MLVA type 
      was MT-159 (13%, n = 21). MLST analysis confirmed the presence of CC17 during the 
      entire study period. The number of isolates resistant to gentamicin and 
      vancomycin, as well as the presence of hyl, increased significantly during the 
      investigation period. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates that nosocomial 
      infections caused by Ent. faecium CC17 are commonly occurring in Sweden. 
      SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report of CC17 Ent. 
      faecium in Sweden. The increase of antibiotic resistance and virulence indicates 
      that these strains are further adapting to the hospital environment.

AB  - AIMS: The level of genetic diversity and relationships between the specific 
      genotypes and the distribution of virulence determinants among Enterococcus 
      faecalis strains isolated from patients hospitalized in different wards of two 
      hospitals were investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-six clinical strains of 
      E. faecalis, isolated from patients hospitalized in the period of 1999-2004 in 
      several wards in Wroclaw (Poland), were analysed by multiple-locus 
      variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA). Analysis of seven genomic loci 
      identified 40 novel genotypes among the analysed E. faecalis strains, with two 
      major genomic groups, designated I and II, distinguished at a cut-off of 35%. 
      With a similarity cut-off of 85.7%, the genotypes could be combined into 12 
      clusters (C1-C12), containing at least two isolates. The remaining 18 MLVA types 
      were represented by a single isolate. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the data obtained by 
      MLVA, it was found that (i) many E. faecalis isolates recovered from patients 
      from the wards whose location allowed the potential transmission of 
      micro-organisms, belonged to closely related MLVA types and (ii) possible 
      relationships between specific E. faecalis genotype and the virulence factors 
      lipase, haemolysin and esp gene can exist. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: 
      Our study confirms that MLVA is a suitable method for the epidemiological study 
      of E. faecalis and for the first time shows possible relationships between 
      specific genotypes and such virulence determinants, i.e. lipase, haemolysin and 
      esp gene.

TI  - Automating skeletal expansion: An implant for distraction osteogenesis of the 
      mandible.
PG  - 14502
AB  - BACKGROUND: Distraction osteogenesis (DO) is a technique of bone lengthening that 
      makes use of the body's natural healing capacity. An osteotomy is created and a 
      rigid distraction device is attached to the bone. After a latency period, the 
      device is activated 2-4 times per day for a total of 1 mm/day of bone 
      lengthening. This technique is used to correct a variety of congenital and 
      acquired deformities of the mandible, midface and long bones. To shorten the 
      treatment period and to eliminate the complications of patient activation of the 
      device, an automated continuous distraction device would be desirable. It has 
      been reported that continuous distraction generates adequate bone with 
      lengthening at a rate of 2 mm/day, thereby reducing the treatment time. METHOD OF 
      APPROACH: The device we describe here uses miniature high-pressure hydraulics, 
      position feedback, and a digital controller to achieve closed-loop control of the 
      distraction process. The implanted actuator can produce up to 40N of distraction 
      force on linear trajectories as well as curved distraction paths. In the paper we 
      detail the spring-powered hydraulic reservoir, controller, and user interface. 
      RESULTS: Experiments to test the new device design were performed in a porcine 
      cadaver head and in live pigs. In the cadaver head, the device performed an 
      11-day/11 mm distraction with a root-mean-squared position error of 0.09 mm. The 
      device functioned for periods of several days in each of five live animals, 
      though some component failures occurred, leading to design revisions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The test series showed that the novel design of this system provides 
      the capabilities necessary to automate distraction of the mandible. Further 
      developments will focus on making the implanted position sensor more robust and 
      then carrying out clinical trials.

AB  - X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP, DYT3), endemic in the Philippine island of 
      Panay, is characterized by the clinical onset with dystonia followed by 
      parkinsonism. We found a 35-year-old American male patient, originally from Panay 
      with typical XDP, has a 2-year history of parkinsonism, dystonia, and tremor. 
      Ancestral DYT3 haplotype and disease-specific SVA (short interspersed nuclear 
      element, variable number of tandem repeats, and Alu composite) retrotransposon 
      insertion were identified in the DYT3 proband and two female unaffected family 
      members. No mutation(s) and expression changes in peripheral blood lymphocytes 
      were observed in the TATA-binding protein-associated factor 1 gene (TAF1) or the 
      chemokine CXC motif receptor 3 gene (CXCR3) of the proband or other DYT3 
      carriers. These findings indicate blood DNA test has a diagnostic utility and 
      implications for genetic counseling in families with DYT3. In contrast, TAF1 and 
      CXCR3 gene expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes is not a suitable surrogate 
      disease marker for DYT3.

PG  - 4331-41
LID - 10.1210/jc.2008-1102 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Cell lines derived from human cancers provide critical tools to study 
      disease mechanisms and develop novel therapies. Recent reports indicate that up 
      to 36% of cell lines are cross- contaminated. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated 40 reported 
      thyroid cancer-derived cell lines using short tandem repeat and single nucleotide 
      polymorphism array analysis. RESULTS: Only 23 of 40 cell lines tested have unique 
      genetic profiles. The following groups of cell lines are likely derivatives of 
      the same cell line: BHP5-16, BHP17-10, BHP14-9, and NPA87; BHP2-7, BHP10-3, 
      BHP7-13, and TPC1; KAT5, KAT10, KAT4, KAT7, KAT50, KAK1, ARO81-1, and MRO87-1; 
      and K1 and K2. The unique cell lines include BCPAP, KTC1, TT2609-C02, FTC133, 
      ML1, WRO82-1, 8505C, SW1736, Cal-62, T235, T238, Uhth-104, ACT-1, HTh74, KAT18, 
      TTA1, FRO81-2, HTh7, C643, BHT101, and KTC-2. The misidentified cell lines 
      included the DRO90-1, which matched the melanoma-derived cell line, A-375. The 
      ARO81-1 and its derivatives matched the HT-29 colon cancer cell line, and the 
      NPA87 and its derivatives matched the M14/MDA-MB-435S melanoma cell line. TTF-1 
      and Pax-8 mRNA levels were determined in the unique cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Many 
      of these human cell lines have been widely used in the thyroid cancer field for 
      the past 20 yr and are not only redundant, but not of thyroid origin. These 
      results emphasize the importance of cell line integrity, and provide the short 
      tandem repeat profiles for a panel of thyroid cancer cell lines that can be used 
      as a reference for comparison of cell lines from other laboratories.

TI  - Reduced neuron-specific expression of the TAF1 gene is associated with X-linked 
      dystonia-parkinsonism.
PG  - 393-406
AB  - X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is a movement disorder endemic to the 
      Philippines. The disease locus, DYT3, has been mapped to Xq13.1. In a search for 
      the causative gene, we performed genomic sequencing analysis, followed by 
      expression analysis of XDP brain tissues. We found a disease-specific SVA (short 
      interspersed nuclear element, variable number of tandem repeats, and Alu 
      composite) retrotransposon insertion in an intron of the TATA-binding 
      protein-associated factor 1 gene (TAF1), which encodes the largest component of 
      the TFIID complex, and significantly decreased expression levels of TAF1 and the 
      dopamine receptor D2 gene (DRD2) in the caudate nucleus. We also identified an 
      abnormal pattern of DNA methylation in the retrotransposon in the genome from the 
      patient's caudate, which could account for decreased expression of TAF1. Our 
      findings suggest that the reduced neuron-specific expression of the TAF1 gene is 
      associated with XDP.

TI  - Prediction of spinal canal expansion following cervical laminoplasty: a 
      computer-simulated comparison between single and double-door techniques.
PG  - 2863-70
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Laminoplasty was simulated using a computer-assisted technique to 
      assess the amount of canal expansion. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to 
      clarify the relationship between laminoplasty opening size and increase in 
      sagittal canal diameter, increase in canal area, and the angle of the opened 
      lamina following laminoplasty, and to determine whether a spinous 
      process-splitting laminoplasty achieves the similar canal expansion as a single 
      open-door method. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Single and double-door cervical 
      laminoplasty (SDCL and DDCL, respectively) have been widely used in the treatment 
      of multilevel stenotic conditions. However, the relationship between laminoplasty 
      opening size and spinal canal expansion following laminoplasty, and the 
      comparison of postoperative spinal canal expansion between single and double-door 
      techniques have not been well investigated. METHODS: SDCL and DDCL, based on 
      preoperative computerized tomography scans of 34 patients who had undergone the 
      laminoplasty surgery, were simulated using a computer-assisted technique. 
      Laminoplasty with an opening size of 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 mm were 
      simulated to determine the amount of canal enlargement with the various opening 
      size. RESULTS: Sagittal diameter, canal area, and lamina angle were increased 
      steadily following either single or double-door laminoplasty with the door opened 
      from 6 to 18 mm. Significant positive correlation was found between laminoplasty 
      opening size and increase in sagittal diameter (R2 = 0.969 and P = 0.001 in SDCL; 
      R2 = 0.926 and P < 0.001 in DDCL), increase in canal area (R2 = 0.961 and P < 
      0.001 in SDCL; R2 = 0.937 and P < 0.001 in DDCL), and lamina angle (R2 = 0.959 
      and P < 0.001 in SDCL; R2 = 0.943 and P < 0.001 in DDCL). No significant 
      correlation was observed between preoperative sagittal diameter and increase in 
      sagittal diameter of the spinal canal, whereas significant positive correlation 
      was found between preoperative cross-section area and increase in cross-section 
      area of the spinal canal. The differences between postoperative canal increase in 
      sagittal diameter and canal area for the single versus double-door technique were 
      statistically significant when the door was opened by more than 12 mm (P < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation provides insight into canal expansion after 
      laminoplasty. The increased amount of canal following laminoplasty can be 
      predicted by the regression equations. This may allow preoperative determination 
      of the optimal size of the opening needed to establish adequate canal space for 
      the spinal cord. Both single and double-door techniques of laminoplasty provide 
      sufficient room for posterior migration of the spinal cord, although gaining 
      different canal expansion.

TI  - The effect of pedicle expansion on pedicle morphology and biomechanical stability 
      in the immature porcine spine.
PG  - E826-9
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Biomechanical study in an animal model. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 
      feasibility of sequential dilation of the immature pedicles by dilators and to 
      determine the biomechanical stability of screws placed in these expanded 
      pedicles. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Pedicle screws have become the implant of 
      choice in spinal fixation. Secondary to the small vertebra sizes of pediatric 
      patients and difficulty in finding appropriate screw sizes, they have found 
      limited use in pediatric spine. Dilation of the pediatric pedicles may overcome 
      the limitation secondary to discrepancy between screw sizes. However, there are 
      no data in the literature regarding dilation capacity of pediatric pedicles to 
      enable larger pedicle screw fixation. METHODS: Two-month-old domestic pig 
      vertebrae were used. The right pedicles were dilated with stainless steel 
      dilators just before there is visual evidence of pedicle failure. The left 
      pedicles served as a control group. The inner and outer diameters of the pedicles 
      were measured on the CT scans before and after dilation. The pedicles were 
      instrumented with 3.5-mm pedicle screws at the thoracic level and 4.0-mm pedicle 
      screws at the lumbar level. The pullout strength of each pedicle was measured. 
      RESULTS: The dilation procedure resulted in an increase in both inner (2.59 +/- 
      0.75 to 3.32 +/- 0.58 mm) and outer diameters (5.43 +/- 0.95 to 6.21 +/- 0.96 mm) 
      (P < 0.05). The inner diameters dilated more than the outer diameters (34.3% vs. 
      15.0%). The pullout strength of the expanded pedicles (320.1 +/- 83.9 N) was 
      significantly lower than the nonexpanded ones (408.1 +/- 102.0 N) (P < 0.01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that immature pedicles can be expanded by 
      application of serial dilators. However, dilation significantly decreases the 
      pullout strength of the pedicle.

TI  - Tunnel expansion after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autogenous 
      hamstrings: a comparison of the medial portal and transtibial techniques.
PG  - 1107-12
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of 2 techniques of 
      drilling the femoral tunnel in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction 
      (medial portal v transtibial) on tunnel expansion. METHODS: Autogenous hamstring 
      ACL reconstructions performed by the senior author between July 1998 and July 
      2004, with a minimum 6-month radiographic follow-up, using the transtibial 
      technique (41 patients) and the medial portal technique (34 patients), were 
      evaluated. All procedures were performed via an endoscopic technique with 
      identical postoperative rehabilitation and graft fixation. Lateral and 45 degrees 
      posteroanterior (PA) radiographs were obtained for each patient at a minimum of 6 
      months postoperatively. The sclerotic margins of the femoral and tibial tunnels 
      were measured at the widest dimension of the tunnel by 2 physicians and were 
      compared with the initially drilled tunnel size after correction for radiographic 
      magnification. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the 2 groups by use 
      of the independent-samples t test, with significance set at .05. RESULTS: The 
      mean percentage increase in the femoral tunnel was 38.20% +/- 17.76% for the 
      medial portal technique and 53.96% +/- 21.72% for the transtibial technique on 
      the PA view and 23.80% +/- 16.50% for the medial portal technique and 50.07% +/- 
      26.98% for the transtibial technique on the lateral view. This difference was 
      statistically significant on both PA and lateral views. The mean percentage 
      increase in the tibial tunnel was 31.81% +/- 14.39% for the medial portal 
      technique and 36.31% +/- 17.81% for the transtibial technique on the PA view and 
      27.70% +/- 15.25% for the medial portal technique and 30.11% +/- 18.98% for the 
      transtibial technique on the lateral view; however, these increases failed to 
      reach statistical significance on either view. CONCLUSIONS: Femoral tunnel 
      expansion for hamstring autologous ACL reconstructions is significantly lower for 
      the medial portal technique when compared with the conventional transtibial 
      technique. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective, comparative therapeutic 
      study.

TI  - Effects on lung function of multiple expansion thoracoplasty in children with 
      thoracic insufficiency syndrome: a longitudinal study.
PG  - 284-90
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal study of intraoperative pulmonary function in young 
      children with thoracic hypoplasia and scoliosis undergoing multiple expansion 
      thoracoplasty using the vertical expandable prosthetic titanium ribs (VEPTRs). 
      OBJECTIVE: To test the long-term efficacy of VEPTR multiple expansion 
      thoracoplasty. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: To our knowledge, no direct 
      measurements of pulmonary function have been reported with VEPTR expansion 
      thoracoplasty. METHODS: There were 10 children with thoracic insufficiency 
      syndrome, secondary to thoracic hypoplasia with progressive scoliosis, studied. A 
      mobile pulmonary function laboratory unit was used to study forced vital capacity 
      (FVC), maximum expiratory flow volume curves, and respiratory system compliance 
      (Crs) with the patient under general anesthesia immediately before and after 
      expansion thoracoplasty. Studies were repeated every 6 months at each subsequent 
      operation for expansion thoracoplasty for the duration up to 33 months. RESULTS: 
      At the baseline studies, FVC showed a moderate-to-severe decrease (69% of 
      predicted values), indicating the presence of significant restrictive lung 
      defect. Only 1 of 10 children had severe airway obstruction. The baseline Crs was 
      markedly decreased in part because of the presence of significant atelectasis. 
      Crs increased with an average of 42% after repeated hyperinflation (deep sighs). 
      There was no change in lung volume or function immediately before versus after 
      completion of expansion thoracoplasty. FVC increased significantly over time, 
      with an average rate of 26.8% per year, the rate of increase similar to that of 
      healthy children of comparative ages. In terms of percent-predicted values, FVC 
      did not change significantly between the baseline and last test, indicating that 
      in most children studied, lung growth kept up with body growth. CONCLUSION: 
      Although it is difficult to assess the extent of the efficacy without a proper or 
      historical control group for comparison, the present study indicates that in 
      children with severe thoracic insufficiency syndrome, the insertion of VEPTRs 
      with multiple expansion thoracoplasties is beneficial over time, by allowing the 
      lungs to expand with body growth without further deterioration in lung function.

TI  - The treatment of spine and chest wall deformities with fused ribs by expansion 
      thoracostomy and insertion of vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib: growth 
      of thoracic spine and improvement of lung volumes.
PG  - S58-68
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical trial of vertical expandable prosthetic 
      titanium rib (VEPTR) in patients with combined spine and chest wall deformity 
      with scoliosis and fused ribs. OBJECTIVE: Report the efficacy and safety of 
      expansion thoracostomy and VEPTR surgery in the treatment of thoracic 
      insufficiency syndrome (TIS) associated with fused ribs. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND 
      DATA: Traditional attitudes toward early-onset combined chest and spine deformity 
      assume that thoracic deformity is best controlled by treatment directed at spine 
      deformity, often involving early spinal arthrodesis. Campbell and others have 
      heightened awareness of the interrelationship between lung, chest, and spine 
      development during growth and characterized TIS as the inability of the thorax to 
      support normal respiration or lung growth. Expansion thoracostomy and VEPTR 
      insertion was developed to directly control both spine and chest wall deformity 
      during growth, while permitting continued vertebral column and chest growth at an 
      early stage. METHODS: Multidisciplinary evaluation of children with combined 
      spine and chest wall deformity included pediatric pulmonologist, thoracic, and 
      orthopedic surgeon evaluations. One or more opening wedge expansion 
      thoracostomies and placement of VEPTR devices were performed as described by 
      Campbell, with repeated device lengthenings during growth. Parameters measured 
      included Cobb angle, length of thoracic spine, CT-derived lung volumes, and in 
      older children pulmonary function tests. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with fused 
      ribs and TIS were treated, 4 of whom had undergone prior spinal arthrodesis at 
      other institutions with continued progression of deformity. In 30 patients, the 
      spinal deformity was controlled and growth continued in the thoracic spine during 
      treatment at rates similar to normals. Increased volume of the constricted 
      hemithorax and total lung volumes obtained during expansion thoracostomy were 
      maintained at follow-up. Complications included device migration, infection, and 
      brachial plexus palsy. CONCLUSIONS: Expansion thoracostomy and VEPTR insertion 
      with serial lengthening may be the preferred treatment for young children with 
      chest wall deformity and scoliosis associated with fused ribs but requires 
      multidisciplinary care and attention to details of soft tissue management. When 
      indicated, surgical intervention with VEPTR can be considered early in growth, 
      before deformity is severe, since spinal growth will continue with treatment.

TI  - Postoperative expansion of intramedullary high-intensity areas on T2-weighted 
      magnetic resonance imaging after cervical laminoplasty.
PG  - 1478-82; discussion 1482
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of swelling 
      of the spinal cord with an intramedullary lesion occurring after laminoplasty for 
      nontraumatic cervical myelopathy and the possible mechanism of postoperative 
      motor paresis of the upper extremity. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Postoperative 
      enlargement of the spinal cord with an intramedullary lesion after decompression 
      surgery for cervical stenotic myelopathy has been reported. But the frequency of 
      the incidence remains unknown. Postoperative motor paresis occurring mainly in 
      the C5 and C6 segments is known but various theories on its etiology exist, 
      including the root involvement hypothesis and the spinal cord impairment 
      hypothesis. Thus, the etiology is controversial. METHODS: One hundred fourteen 
      patients with cervical stenotic myelopathy were included in this study. All of 
      them underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and postoperative magnetic 
      resonance imaging 3 weeks after surgery. We watched for the occurrence of 
      postoperative neurologic deterioration including paralysis of the upper 
      extremities. We also observed the presence or absence of postoperative abnormal 
      expansion of T2 high-signal intensity areas on magnetic resonance imaging in the 
      spinal cord. RESULTS: Seven patients (6.1%) showed postoperative abnormal 
      expansion of the T2 high-signal intensity area; 3 of the 7 were asymptomatic. A 
      total of 9 patients (7.9%) experienced unilateral upper motor paresis after 
      surgery. In 4 of the 9 cases, paresis of the unilateral deltoid, biceps and 
      brachialis muscles (proximal paresis) occurred between 4 and 6 days after 
      surgery. None of the 4 showed postoperative abnormal expansion of the T2 
      high-signal intensity area. In 3 other of the 9 patients, distal paresis occurred 
      just after surgical intervention. Two of the 3 showed postoperative abnormal 
      expansion of the T2 high-signal intensity area and 1 showed slight expansion of 
      the area. In the other 2 cases, diffuse paresis occurred, and their postoperative 
      magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal expansion of the T2 high-signal 
      intensity area. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal cord enlargement with abnormal expansion of 
      the T2 high-signal intensity area, although not common, is an unpreventable 
      complication after laminoplasty. This was strongly related with distal and 
      diffuse type of postoperative paresis of the upper extremity without 
      deterioration of lower motor function, but was little associated with a proximal 
      type of paresis, so-called C5 and C6 palsies.

TI  - Timeline of tibial tunnel expansion after single-incision hamstring anterior 
      cruciate ligament reconstruction.
PG  - 34-6
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the time frame for tibial 
      tunnel expansion in patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) 
      reconstruction with hamstring autografts using an endoscopic technique. Does this 
      expansion occur immediately after surgery or over the first 12 weeks of 
      rehabilitation? TYPE OF STUDY: Observational study involving 10 patients. 
      METHODS: The single incision technique used a transtibial approach for drilling 
      the femoral tunnel. Femoral fixation was accomplished with a closed-loop 
      EndoButton (Acufex, Smith & Nephew; Mansfield, MA) and tibial fixation with a 
      soft tissue screw and washer augmented by a polylactic acid interference screw. 
      Computed tomography (CT) scans were taken in a consistent manner at weeks 1 and 
      12 after surgery to measure tibial and femoral tunnel expansion. RESULTS: The CT 
      scans showed significant widening of the tibial tunnel between 1 and 12 weeks 
      (mean area of tibial tunnel increased from 82.5 to 112.7 mm2; P =.001). Expansion 
      of the femoral tunnel was also seen; however, this change was not statistically 
      significant (P =.18). CONCLUSIONS: The expansion after surgery occurred over 
      time, not immediately after surgery, and was probably caused by factors other 
      than surgical technique. The significance of tibial tunnel expansion needs to be 
      clinically correlated with a long-term study on the effect of tunnel expansion on 
      graft survival.

TI  - Growth of the thoracic spine in congenital scoliosis after expansion 
      thoracoplasty.
PG  - 409-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with congenital thoracic scoliosis associated with fused 
      ribs with a unilateral unsegmented bar adjacent to convex hemivertebrae will 
      invariably have curve progression without treatment. Surgery has been thought to 
      have a negligible growth-inhibition effect on the thoracic spine in such patients 
      because it has been assumed that the concave side of the curve and the unilateral 
      unsegmented bar do not grow, but we are unaware of any conclusive studies 
      regarding this assumption. METHODS: The changes in the length of the concave and 
      convex sides, anterior and posterior vertebral edges, posterior arch, and 
      unilateral unsegmented bars of the thoracic spine were measured in the twenty-one 
      children with congenital scoliosis and fused ribs after expansion thoracoplasty 
      had been carried out with use of a vertical, expandable titanium prosthetic rib. 
      Three of these children had undergone posterior spinal fusion previously. 
      Measurements were made with use of a three-dimensional software program that 
      analyzed baseline and follow-up computed tomography scans. The technique was 
      validated through measurement of the thorax of a small female adult cadaver. 
      RESULTS: The patients without spine fusion had an average age of 3.3 years at the 
      time of the baseline computed tomography scan, and the average duration of 
      follow-up was 4.2 years. On the average, these patients showed significant growth 
      (p < 0.0001) of the concave side of the thoracic spine (an increase in length of 
      7.9 mm/yr, or 7.1%/yr) and the convex side (8.3 mm/yr, or 6.4%/yr) compared with 
      the baseline lengths. There was no significant difference in the increases in 
      length (p = 0.38) between the concave and convex sides. Eleven patients with an 
      unsegmented bar had an average 7.3% increase in the length of the bar (p < 
      0.0001). In the three children with prior spinal fusion, the increase in length 
      averaged only 4.6 mm/yr (3%/yr) on the concave side of the thoracic spine and 3.7 
      mm/yr (2.2%/yr) on the convex side; both increases were significant (p < 0.0001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal growth of the thoracic spine in a normal child has been 
      estimated to be 0.6 cm/yr between the ages of five and nine years. After 
      expansion thoracoplasty, growth of the thoracic spine was approximately 8 mm/yr 
      in our series of children with congenital scoliosis and fused ribs. After 
      expansion thoracoplasty, both the concave and the convex side of the thoracic 
      spine and unilateral unsegmented bars appeared to grow in these patients. When a 
      thorax is already foreshortened by congenital scoliosis, control of spine 
      deformity with expansion thoracoplasty allows growth of the thoracic spine, and 
      it is likely that the longer thorax provides additional volume for growth of the 
      underlying lungs with probable clinical benefit. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic 
      study, Level IV (case series [no, or historical, control group]). See 
      Instructions to Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

TI  - A model for the involvement of Okazaki fragments maturation in the expansion of 
      short tandem repeats.
PG  - 153-9
AB  - We propose a model for the expansion of short tandem repeats (ESTR), a phenomenon 
      which has been found to occur in human DNA and is associated with a dozen of 
      neuromuscular diseases. The model is based mainly on theoretical considerations 
      and recovers experimental data from the literature; it also finds support in 
      preliminary results obtained by us in multiprimed polymerase chain reactions 
      designed to assess the effects of a downstream primer on the fidelity of the 
      elongation of an upstream one. The model links the occurrence of the ESTR to a 
      defective maturation of the Okazaki fragments (OF), and in particular to an 
      improper processing of their 3' termini. This may occur when the last OF 
      approaches the 5' terminus of the previous one in a susceptible region of the 
      template. It is postulated here that when a growing OF has progressed past the 
      priming region and its main portion has been synthesized, upon approaching its 
      conclusion, the final elongation may take place in a region of the template where 
      certain triplets are repeated: in that case a series of aberrations on the 
      elongation mechanism may occur. These aberrations could involve (a) the 
      displacement of the 5' terminus of the penultimate, properly matured OF, enacted 
      by the incoming 3' terminus of the last OF, (b) the switch of the latter to the 
      displaced strand of the former as template, (c) the fold-back on itself of the 
      growing 3' terminus of the last OF, (d) its assumption of an unusual structure 
      because of the repetition, and (e) some impairment of its removal by 
      structure-specific exo-endonuclease(s). Derangements of this last part of the 
      process may trigger the ESTR.

TI  - Association between an aggrecan gene polymorphism and lumbar disc degeneration.
PG  - 2456-60
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A case-control study using magnetic resonance imaging findings and 
      a polymerase chain reaction assay to investigate the association between aggrecan 
      gene polymorphism and lumbar disc degeneration. OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether the 
      aggrecan gene polymorphism is related to lumbar disc disease in young women. 
      SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: It has been suggested that a genetic factor or 
      familial predisposition contributes to the development of lumbar disc herniation. 
      However, the precise genetic component related to disc disease remains unclear. 
      Recently, a polymorphism has been identified in the region of the human aggrecan 
      gene. The expressed variable numbers of tandem repeat polymorphism occur in the 
      highly conserved repeat region. METHODS: The participants were 64 young women 
      with or without low back problems. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to 
      evaluate the degeneration and herniation of the intervertebral disc. Genomic 
      deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from all participants. A polymerase chain 
      reaction assay was carried out to detect the alleles of the aggrecan gene. The 
      association of intervertebral disc degeneration and herniation with the 
      distribution of the aggrecan gene alleles was analyzed. RESULTS: Findings showed 
      an overrepresentation of alleles with small numbers of repeats in subjects with 
      multilevel disc degeneration, thus indicating a significant distribution 
      difference. There also was a significant difference between the distribution of 
      alleles and the severity of disc degeneration. No significant association was 
      found between any of the alleles either in number or type of disc herniation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed that multilevel and severe disc 
      degeneration was present in the participants with shorter variable numbers of 
      tandem repeat length of the aggrecan gene. This suggests that subjects with 
      shorter variable numbers of tandem repeat length of the aggrecan gene have a risk 
      of having multilevel disc degeneration develop at an early age.

TI  - The biomechanical effect and clinical application of a Ni-Ti shape memory 
      expansion clamp.
PG  - 2083-8
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: The study involves three phases: a clinical study of 30 patients, a 
      biomechanical study to assess the expansion force of a recovering-shape memory 
      expansion clamp, and a biomechanical study using cadaveric specimens to assess 
      the pullout strength of the shape memory expansion clamp as a function of the 
      shape of the clamp. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the biomechanical effect and clinical 
      application of the shape memory expansion clamp. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The 
      major complication of anterior cervical decompression and fusion was graft 
      dislodgement and pseudarthrosis. Improvement of the shape of bone graft and 
      fusion technique could not eliminate the problem completely. The authors designed 
      the shape memory expansion clamp by using the characteristic of Ni-Ti shape 
      memory alloy and first applied it in an anterior cervical operation. METHODS: The 
      expansion force of recovering of the shape memory expansion clamp was measured in 
      a biomechanical study. Eight fresh human cadaver cervical spine specimens were 
      used to assess the pullout strength of the shape memory expansion clamp as a 
      function of the shape of the clamp. The shape memory expansion clamp had been 
      used to fix rotated circular grafts in 30 cases with cervical spine injuries or 
      cervical spondylosis after anterior decompression. RESULTS: The expansion force 
      of the shape memory expansion clamp in recovery was 4.65-27.96 N, and the pullout 
      strength was 8.82-20.58 N. Bone fusion was achieved in all 30 cases. Dislocation 
      of bone graft, loosening of clamp, or kyphotic deformity had not occurred. 
      CONCLUSION: The expansion force and the pullout strength of the partially 
      recovered shape memory expansion clamp were determined biomechanically. The 
      clinical study demonstrated that the shape memory expansion clamp is safe and 
      effective.

TI  - Assignment of the dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome locus, DYT3, to a small region 
      within a 1.8-Mb YAC contig of Xq13.1.
PG  - 644-50
AB  - A YAC contig was constructed of Xq13.1 in order to sublocalize the X-linked 
      dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) syndrome locus, DYT3. The contig spans a region of 
      approximately 1.8 Mb and includes loci DXS453/DXS348/IL2R gamma/GJB1/CCG1/DXS559. 
      For the construction of the contig, nine sequence-tagged sites and four short 
      tandem repeat polymorphisms (STRPs) were isolated. The STRPs, designated as 
      4704#6 (DXS7113), 4704#7 (DXS7114), 67601 (DXS7117), and B4Pst (DXS7119) were 
      assigned to a region flanked by DXS348 proximally and by DXS559 distally. Their 
      order was DXS348/4704 #6/4704 #7/67601/B4Pst/DXS559. They were applied to the 
      analysis of allelic association and of haplotypes in 47 not-obviously-related XDP 
      patients and in 105 Filipino male controls. The same haplotype was found at loci 
      67601 (DXS7117) and B4Pst (DXS7119) in 42 of 47 patients. This percentage of 
      common haplotypes decreased at the adjacent loci. The findings, together with the 
      previous demonstration of DXS559 being the distal flanking marker of DYT3, assign 
      the disease locus to a small region in Xq13.1 defined by loci 67601 (DXS7117) and 
      B4Pst (DXS7119). The location of DYT3 was born out by the application of a newly 
      developed likelihood method for the analysis of linkage disequilibrium.

TI  - Spinal cord expansion after decompression in cervical myelopathy. Investigation 
      by computed tomography myelography and ultrasonography.
PG  - 1657-63
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This study analyzed anatomic characteristics of 44 patients with 
      cervical myelopathy. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to clarify the patterns 
      of spinal cord expansion after decompression, their relationship to clinical 
      recovery, and the capacity of the compressed spinal cord for restoration. SUMMARY 
      OF BACKGROUND DATA: No previous studies have clearly assessed the relationship 
      between morphological changes of the spinal cord and clinical improvement after 
      posterior decompression in patients with cervical myelopathy using computerized 
      tomography myelography and intraoperative spinal sonography. METHODS: Forty-four 
      patients with cervical myelopathy underwent posterior decompression. The 
      diagnosis was cervical spondylosis in 26 patients and ossification of the 
      posterior longitudinal ligament in 18 patients. The cross-sectional area, 
      sagittal diameter, and frontal diameter of the spinal cord at the level of 
      maximum compression were determined by computerized tomography myelography 
      (performed before and 1 month after decompression) and by intraoperative spinal 
      sonography. RESULTS: Expansion of the spinal cord was defined as immediate or 
      gradual. Of the 44 patients, 20 demonstrated gradual expansion, and their 
      clinical recovery rate was 68.4%. In contrast, the clinical recovery rate of 
      patients without gradual expansion was only 32.6%. Good clinical recovery was 
      significantly related to gradual expansion. The patients were divided into four 
      groups (A-D) based on the clinical recovery rate and compression ratio. Group A 
      (severe compression and poor clinical recovery) showed a significantly smaller 
      cross-sectional area of the spinal cord than Group D (severe compression, but 
      good clinical recovery). CONCLUSIONS: Preservation of the cross-sectional area of 
      the spinal cord, even when it is severely compressed and deformed, is an 
      important factor in a good surgical outcome.

TI  - DXS106 and DXS559 flank the X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome locus (DYT3).
PG  - 114-7
AB  - The locus (DYT3) underlying the X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome (XDP) was 
      delineated within proximal Xq12-Xq13.1 by analysis of linkage, allelic 
      association, and haplotypes. Short tandem repeat polymorphisms at loci DXS227, 
      DXS559, DXS453, DXS106, DXS339, and DXS135 were studied. The occurrence of a 
      recombination within a three-generation family established DXS559 as the distal 
      flanking marker of DYT3. /phi/ and /delta/ values were determined as indicators 
      of the degree of allelic association between DYT3 and the six marker loci. In 
      addition, haplotype analysis was performed at the loci studied. The findings 
      establish DXS106 as the proximal flanking marker of DYT3. Given an approximate 
      distance between DXS106 and DXS559 of 3.0 Mb, isolation of DYT3 is now feasible 
      by positional cloning techniques.

TI  - Delineation of the dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome locus in Xq13.
PG  - 8245-8
AB  - The X chromosome-linked dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome (XDP) is a severe movement 
      disorder, characterized by both dystonia and parkinsonism. XDP is a genetically 
      homogeneous disorder. Known ancestry of all patients has been traced back to 
      Panay, Philippines, where the disease probably originated from a single mutation 
      (founder effect). The gene locus, DYT3, has been previously assigned to the 
      proximal long arm of the X chromosome (Xq12-q21.1). Using four dinucleotide 
      tandem repeat (DNTR) sequences from Xq13-derived yeast artificial chromosomes 
      (YACs), we further delineate DYT3 within Xq13. Observation of a recombination 
      event between DYT3 and DNTR locus 4548-7, derived from a YAC encompassing locus 
      DXS56, establishes 4548-7 as a distal flanking marker. Assignment of DYT3 to a 
      region in Xq13, flanked by loci 4548-7 and DXS159, is further supported by highly 
      significant allelic association between DYT3 and a total of four DNTR 
      loci--PY2-31, PY5-10, 4548-1, and 4548-7--located in a region defined by PGK1 and 
      DXS56. /phi/ and /delta/ values were 0.82/0.35, 0.78/0.42, 0.65/0.34, and 
      0.88/0.58 for PY2-31, PY5-10, 4548-1, and 4548-7 at P less than 10(-2), P less 
      than 10(-4), P less than 10(-3), and P less than 10(-6).
