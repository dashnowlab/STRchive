      spectrum disorder in two families.

AB  - We report de novo occurrence of the 7p11.2 folate-sensitive fragile site FRA7A in 
      a male with an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) due to a CGG-repeat expansion 
      mutation ( approximately 450 repeats) in a 5' intron of ZNF713. This expanded allele showed 
      hypermethylation of the adjacent CpG island with reduced ZNF713 expression 
      observed in a proband-derived lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL). His unaffected 
      mother carried an unmethylated premutation (85 repeats). This CGG-repeat showed 
      length polymorphism in control samples (five to 22 repeats). In a second 
      unrelated family, three siblings with ASD and their unaffected father were found 
      to carry FRA7A premutations, which were partially or mosaically methylated. In 
      one of the affected siblings, mitotic instability of the premutation was 
      observed. ZNF713 expression in LCLs in this family was increased in three of 
      these four premutation carriers. A firm link cannot yet be established between 
      ASD and the repeat expansion mutation but plausible pathogenic mechanisms are 
      discussed.
