AB  - INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy type 4 (OPDM4) arises from a CGG 
      repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of the RILPL1 gene. Reported cases of OPDM4 have 
      been limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical and 
      myopathological characteristics of OPDM4 patients with advanced disease. METHODS: 
      We assessed a total of 8 affected and 12 unaffected individuals in an OPDM4 
      family with autosomal dominant inheritance. Muscle biopsy tissue from the proband 
      underwent histological, enzyme histochemical, and immunohistochemical stains, and 
      electron microscopy analysis. Whole exome sequencing and repeat primer PCR 
      (RP-PCR) were conducted to investigate underlying variants. RESULTS: OPDM4 
      patients displayed a progressive disease course. Most experienced lower limb 
      weakness and diminished walking ability in their 20s and 30s, followed by ptosis, 
      ophthalmoplegia, swallowing difficulties, and dysarthria in their 30s to 50s, By 
      their 50s to 70s, they became non-ambulatory. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) of the proband in advanced disease revealed severe fatty infiltration of 
      pelvic girdle and lower limb muscles. Biopsied muscle tissue exhibited advanced 
      changes typified by adipose connective tissue replacement and the presence of 
      multiple eosinophilic and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions. Immunopositivity 
      for the intranuclear inclusions was observed with anti-glycine antibody and 
      laboratory-made polyA-R1 antibody. RP-PCR unveiled an abnormal CGG repeat 
      expansion in the 5' UTR of the RILPL1 gene. DISCUSSION: The clinical and 
      radiological features in this family broaden the phenotypic spectrum of OPDM4. 
      The presence of intranuclear inclusions in the proliferative adipose connective 
      tissues of muscle biopsy specimens holds diagnostic significance for OPDM4 in 
      advanced disease.

TI  - Linking LRP12 CGG repeat expansion to inherited peripheral neuropathy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The causative genes for over 60% of inherited peripheral neuropathy 
      (IPN) remain unidentified. This study endeavours to enhance the genetic 
      diagnostic rate in IPN cases by conducting screenings focused on non-coding 
      repeat expansions. METHODS: We gathered data from 2424 unrelated Japanese 
      patients diagnosed with IPN, among whom 1555 cases with unidentified genetic 
      causes, as determined through comprehensive prescreening analyses, were selected 
      for the study. Screening for CGG non-coding repeat expansions in LRP12, GIPC1 and 
      RILPL1 genes was conducted using PCR and long-read sequencing technologies. 
      RESULTS: We identified CGG repeat expansions in LRP12 from 44 cases, establishing 
      it as the fourth most common aetiology in Japanese IPN. Most cases (29/37) 
      exhibited distal limb weakness, without ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, facial muscle 
      weakness or bulbar palsy. Neurogenic changes were frequently observed in both 
      needle electromyography (97%) and skeletal muscle tissue (100%). In nerve 
      conduction studies, 28 cases primarily showed impairment in motor nerves without 
      concurrent involvement of sensory nerves, consistent with the phenotype of 
      hereditary motor neuropathy. In seven cases, both motor and sensory nerves were 
      affected, resembling the Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) phenotype. Importantly, the 
      mean CGG repeat number detected in the present patients was significantly shorter 
      than that of patients with LRP12-oculopharyngodistal myopathy (p<0.0001). 
      Additionally, GIPC1 and RILPL1 repeat expansions were absent in our IPN cases. 
      CONCLUSION: We initially elucidate LRP12 repeat expansions as a prevalent cause 
      of CMT, highlighting the necessity for an adapted screening strategy in clinical 
      practice, particularly when addressing patients with IPN.

TI  - Non-coding CGG repeat expansion in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 is associated with a 
      phenotype of oculopharyngodistal myopathy.
PG  - 340-346
LID - 10.1136/jmg-2023-109345 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is a rare adult-onset 
      neuromuscular disease, associated with CGG repeat expansions in the 5' 
      untranslated region of LRP12, GIPC1, NOTCH2NLC and RILPL1. However, the genetic 
      cause of a proportion of pathoclinically confirmed cases remains unknown. 
      METHODS: A total of 26 OPDM patients with unknown genetic cause(s) from 4 
      tertiary referral hospitals were included in this study. Clinical data and 
      laboratory findings were collected. Muscle samples were observed by histological 
      and immunofluorescent staining. Long-read sequencing was initially conducted in 
      six patients with OPDM. Repeat-primed PCR was used to screen the CGG repeat 
      expansions in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 in all 26 patients. RESULTS: We identified CGG 
      repeat expansion in the non-coding transcripts of LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 in another 
      two unrelated Chinese cases with typical pathoclinical features of OPDM. The 
      repeat expansion was more than 70 times in the patients but less than 40 times in 
      the normal controls. Both patients showed no leucoencephalopathy but one showed 
      mild cognitive impairment detected by Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Rimmed 
      vacuoles and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions (INIs) were identified in 
      muscle pathology, and colocalisation of CGG RNA foci with p62 was also found in 
      the INIs of patient-derived fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: We identified another two 
      unrelated cases with CGG repeat expansion in the long non-coding RNA of the 
      LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 gene, presenting with a phenotype of OPDM. Our cases 
      broadened the recognised phenotypic spectrum and pathogenesis in the disease 
      associated with CGG repeat expansion in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an autosomal dominant 
      adult-onset degenerative muscle disorder characterized by ptosis, ophthalmoplegia 
      and weakness of the facial, pharyngeal and limb muscles. Trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions in non-coding regions of LRP12, G1PC1, NOTCH2NLC and RILPL1 were 
      reported to be the etiologies for OPDM. RESULTS: In this study, we performed 
      long-read whole-genome sequencing in a large five-generation family of 156 
      individuals, including 21 patients diagnosed with typical OPDM. We identified CGG 
      repeat expansions in 5'UTR of RILPL1 gene in all patients we tested while no CGG 
      expansion in unaffected family members. Repeat-primed PCR and fluorescence 
      amplicon length analysis PCR were further confirmed the segregation of CGG 
      expansions in other family members and 1000 normal Chinese controls. Methylation 
      analysis indicated that methylation levels of the RILPL1 gene were unaltered in 
      OPDM patients, which was consistent with previous studies. Our findings provide 
      evidence that RILPL1 is associated OPDM in this large pedigree. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results identified RILPL1 is the associated the disease in this large pedigree.

TI  - GGC Repeat Expansion of RILPL1 is Associated with Oculopharyngodistal Myopathy.
PG  - 512-526

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an adult-onset neuromuscular 
      disease characterized by progressive ptosis, dysarthria, ophthalmoplegia, and 
      distal muscle weakness. Recent studies revealed that GGC repeat expansions in 
      5'-UTR of LRP12, GIPC1, and NOTCH2NLC are associated with OPDM. Despite these 
      advances, approximately 30% of OPDM patients remain genetically undiagnosed. 
      Herein, we aim to investigate the genetic basis for undiagnosed OPDM patients in 
      two unrelated Chinese Han families. METHODS: Parametric linkage analysis was 
      performed. Long-read sequencing followed by repeat-primed polymerase chain 
      reaction and amplicon length polymerase chain reaction were used to determine the 
      genetic cause. Targeted methylation sequencing was implemented to detect 
      epigenetic changes. The possible pathogenesis mechanism was investigated by 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, RNA fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization, and immunofluorescence staining of muscle biopsy samples. RESULTS: 
      The disease locus was mapped to 12q24.3. Subsequently, GGC repeat expansion in 
      the promoter region of RILPL1 was identified in six OPDM patients from two 
      families, findings consistent with a founder effect, designated as OPDM type 4. 
      Targeted methylation sequencing revealed hypermethylation at the RILPL1 locus in 
      unaffected individuals with ultralong expansion. Analysis of muscle samples 
      showed no significant differences in RILPL1 mRNA or RILPL1 protein levels between 
      patients and controls. Public CAGE-seq data indicated that alternative 
      transcription start sites exist upstream of the RefSeq-annotated RILPL1 
      transcription start site. Strand-specific RNA-seq data revealed bidirectional 
      transcription from the RILPL1 locus. Finally, fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization/immunofluorescence staining showed that both sense and antisense 
      transcripts formed RNA foci, and were co-localized with hnRNPA2B1 and p62 in the 
      intranuclear inclusions of OPDM type 4 patients. INTERPRETATION: Our findings 
      implicate abnormal GGC repeat expansions in the promoter region of RILPL1 as a 
      novel genetic cause for OPDM, and suggest a methylation mechanism and a potential 
      RNA toxicity mechanism are involved in OPDM type 4 pathogenesis. ANN NEUROL

AB  - Recent studies indicate that CGG repeat expansions in LRP12, GIPC1, and NOTCH2NLC 
      are associated with oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) types 1, 2, and 3, 
      respectively. However, some clinicopathologically confirmed OPDM cases continue 
      to have unknown genetic causes. Here, through a combination of long-read 
      whole-genome sequencing (LRS), repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR), 
      and fluorescence amplicon length analysis PCR (AL-PCR), we found that a CGG 
      repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of RILPL1 is associated with familial and simplex 
      OPDM type 4 (OPDM4). The number of repeats ranged from 139 to 197. Methylation 
      analysis indicates that the methylation levels in RILPL1 were unaltered in OPDM4 
      individuals. Analyses of muscle biopsies suggested that the expanded CGG repeat 
      might be translated into a toxic poly-glycine protein that co-localizes with p62 
      in intranuclear inclusions. Moreover, analyses suggest that the toxic RNA 
      gain-of-function effects also contributed to the pathogenesis of this disease. 
      Intriguingly, all four types of OPDM have been found to be associated with the 
      CGG repeat expansions located in 5' UTRs. This finding suggests that a common 
      pathogenic mechanism, driven by the CGG repeat expansion, might underlie all 
      cases of OPDM.
