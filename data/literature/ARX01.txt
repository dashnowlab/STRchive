TI  - Exploring unsolved cases of lissencephaly spectrum: integrating exome and genome 
      sequencing for higher diagnostic yield.
LID - 10.1038/s10038-024-01283-0 [doi]
AB  - Lissencephaly is a rare brain malformation characterized by abnormal neuronal 
      migration during cortical development. In this study, we performed a 
      comprehensive genetic analysis using next-generation sequencing in 12 unsolved 
      Japanese lissencephaly patients, in whom PAFAH1B1, DCX, TUBA1A, and ARX variants 
      were excluded using the Sanger method. Exome sequencing (ES) was conducted on 
      these 12 patients, identifying pathogenic variants in CEP85L, DYNC1H1, LAMC3, and 
      DCX in four patients. Next, we performed genome sequencing (GS) on eight unsolved 
      patients, and structural variants in PAFAH1B1, including an inversion and 
      microdeletions involving several exons, were detected in three patients. Notably, 
      these microdeletions in PAFAH1B1 could not to be detected by copy number 
      variation (CNV) detection tools based on the depth of coverage methods using ES 
      data. The density of repeat sequences, including Alu sequences or segmental 
      duplications, which increase the susceptibility to structural variations, is very 
      high in some lissencephaly spectrum genes (PAFAH1B1, TUBA1A, DYNC1H1). These 
      missing CNVs were due to the limitations of detecting repeat sequences in 
      ES-based CNV detection tools. Our study suggests that a combined approach 
      integrating ES with GS can contribute to a higher diagnostic yield and a better 
      understanding of the genetic landscape of the lissencephaly spectrum.

TI  - Clinical and genetic study of developmental and epileptic encephalopathy in 
      Argentinean pediatric patients.
PG  - 856-865
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to extend our knowledge of the genetic 
      background of Argentinean pediatric patients with developmental and epileptic 
      encephalopathy (DEE) applying a next generation sequencing (NGS) panel. METHODS: 
      Thirty one patients with DEE were studied, including these phenotypes: Dravet 
      syndrome (n:7), Dravet like syndrome (n:3), West syndrome (WS) (n:6), WS that 
      evolved to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) (n:4), epilepsy of infancy with 
      migrating focal seizures (n:2), continuous spikes and waves during slow sleep 
      evolving to LGS (n:1), LGS (n:1), myoclonic status in non-progressive 
      encephalopathy (n:1), myoclonic atonic epilepsy (n:1), epileptic encephalopathy 
      with multifocal spikes (n:1) and unclassified epileptic encephalopathy (n:4). 
      Fifty-two genes frequently associated with DEE were studied by NGS in genomic DNA 
      from peripheral blood. RESULTS: Relevant variants were detected in 12 cases; 6 
      novel pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, 6 previously reported as 
      pathogenic and 1 variant of unknown significance. Single-nucleotide heterozygous 
      variants were identified in the SCN1A (5), GABRG2 (1), STXBP1 (2) genes, a mosaic 
      variant in SCN2A (1) and a homozygous variant in SCN1B (1). Additionally, a 
      heterozygous deletion involving the SCN1A, SCN2A and SCN3A genes (1), and the 
      most frequent triplet repeat expansion in the ARX gene (1) were detected. 
      DISCUSSION: Genetic diagnosis was made in 39% of patients. We emphasize the 
      importance of considering mosaic variants, copy number variants and hereditary 
      forms when designing and interpreting molecular studies, to optimize diagnosis 
      and management of patients. Approximately 42% of the detected variants were 
      novel, expanding the knowledge of the molecular basis of DEEs in Latin-American 
      patients.

TI  - Different types of disease-causing noncoding variants revealed by genomic and 
      gene expression analyses in families with X-linked intellectual disability.
PG  - 835-847
LID - 10.1002/humu.24207 [doi]
AB  - The pioneering discovery research of X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) 
      genes has benefitted thousands of individuals worldwide; however, approximately 
      30% of XLID families still remain unresolved. We postulated that noncoding 
      variants that affect gene regulation or splicing may account for the lack of a 
      genetic diagnosis in some cases. Detecting pathogenic, gene-regulatory variants 
      with the same sensitivity and specificity as structural and coding variants is a 
      major challenge for Mendelian disorders. Here, we describe three pedigrees with 
      suggestive XLID where distinctive phenotypes associated with known genes guided 
      the identification of three different noncoding variants. We used comprehensive 
      structural, single-nucleotide, and repeat expansion analyses of genome 
      sequencing. RNA-Seq from patient-derived cell lines, reverse-transcription 
      polymerase chain reactions, Western blots, and reporter gene assays were used to 
      confirm the functional effect of three fundamentally different classes of 
      pathogenic noncoding variants: a retrotransposon insertion, a novel intronic 
      splice donor, and a canonical splice variant of an untranslated exon. In one 
      family, we excluded a rare coding variant in ARX, a known XLID gene, in favor of 
      a regulatory noncoding variant in OFD1 that correlated with the clinical 
      phenotype. Our results underscore the value of genomic research on unresolved 
      XLID families to aid novel, pathogenic noncoding variant discovery.

TI  - Arx expansion mutation perturbs cortical development by augmenting apoptosis 
      without activating innate immunity in a mouse model of X-linked infantile spasms 
      syndrome.
LID - 10.1242/dmm.042515 [doi]
LID - dmm042515
AB  - X-linked infantile spasms syndrome (ISSX) is a clinically devastating 
      developmental epileptic encephalopathy with life-long impact. Arx((GCG)10+7) , a 
      mouse model of the most common triplet-repeat expansion mutation of ARX, exhibits 
      neonatal spasms, electrographic phenotypes and abnormal migration of GABAergic 
      interneuron subtypes. Neonatal presymptomatic treatment with 17beta-estradiol (E2) 
      in Arx((GCG)10+7) reduces spasms and modifies progression of epilepsy. Cortical 
      pathology during this period, a crucial point for clinical intervention in ISSX, 
      has largely been unexplored, and the pathogenic cellular defects that are 
      targeted by early interventions are unknown. In the first postnatal week, we 
      identified a transient wave of elevated apoptosis in Arx((GCG)10+7) mouse cortex 
      that is non-Arx cell autonomous, since mutant Arx-immunoreactive (Arx(+)) cells 
      are not preferentially impacted by cell death. NeuN(+) (also known as Rbfox3) 
      survival was also not impacted, suggesting a vulnerable subpopulation in the 
      immature Arx((GCG)10+7) cortex. Inflammatory processes during this period might 
      explain this transient elevation in apoptosis; however, transcriptomic and 
      immunohistochemical profiling of several markers of inflammation revealed no 
      innate immune activation in Arx((GCG)10+7) cortex. Neither neonatal E2 hormone 
      therapy, nor ACTH(1-24), the frontline clinical therapy for ISSX, diminished the 
      augmented apoptosis in Arx((GCG)10+7) , but both rescued neocortical Arx(+) cell 
      density. Since early E2 treatment effectively prevents seizures in this model, 
      enhanced apoptosis does not solely account for the seizure phenotype, but may 
      contribute to other aberrant brain function in ISSX. However, since both hormone 
      therapies, E2 and ACTH(1-24), elevate the density of cortical 
      Arx(+)-interneurons, their early therapeutic role in other neurological disorders 
      hallmarked by interneuronopathy should be explored.This article has an associated 
      First Person interview with the first author of the paper.

AB  - The Aristaless-related homeobox gene (ARX) is indispensable for interneuron 
      development. Patients with ARX polyalanine expansion mutations of the first two 
      tracts (namely PA1 and PA2) suffer from intellectual disability of varying 
      severity, with seizures a frequent comorbidity. The impact of PA1 and PA2 
      mutations on the brain development is unknown, hindering the search for 
      therapeutic interventions. Here, we characterized the disturbances to cortical 
      interneuron development in mice modeling the two most common ARX polyalanine 
      expansion mutations in human. We found a consistent  approximately 40-50% reduction of 
      calbindin-positive interneurons, but not Stt+ or Cr+ interneurons, within the 
      cortex of newborn hemizygous mice (p=0.024) for both mutant strains compared to 
      wildtype (p=0.011). We demonstrate that this was a consequence of calbindin 
      precursor cells being arrested or delayed at the ventral subpallium en route of 
      tangential migration. Ex-vivo assay validated this migration deficit in PA1 cells 
      (p=0.0002) suggesting that the defect is contributed by intrinsic loss of Arx 
      function within migrating cells. Both humans and mice with PA1 mutations present 
      with severe clinical features, including intellectual disability and infantile 
      spasms. Our data further demonstrated the pathogenic mechanism was robustly 
      shared between PA1 and PA2 mutations, as previously reported including Arx 
      protein reduction and overlapping transcriptome profiles within the developing 
      mouse brains. Data from our study demonstrated that cortical calbindin 
      interneuron development and migration is negatively affected by ARX polyalanine 
      expansion mutations. Understanding the cellular pathogenesis contributing to 
      disease manifestation is necessary to screen efficacy of potential therapeutic 
      interventions.

AB  - The Aristaless-related homeobox gene (ARX) is a known intellectual disability 
      (ID) gene that frequently presents with X-linked infantile spasm syndrome as a 
      comorbidity. ID with epilepsy in children is a chronic and devastating disorder 
      that has poor treatment options and disease outcomes. To gain a better 
      understanding of the role that mutations in ARX play in ID and epilepsy, we 
      investigate ARX patient mutations modelled in mice. Over half of all ARX 
      mutations result from expansions of the first two polyalanine (PA1 and PA2 
      respectively) tracts. However, phenotypic data for the mouse modelling the more 
      frequent ARX PA2 dup24 mutation in patients has not been reported and constitutes 
      a barrier to understanding the molecular mechanisms involved. Here we report the 
      first comprehensive analysis of postnatal outcomes for mice modelling 
      disease-causing expansions to both PA1 and PA2 tracts. Both strains were found to 
      have impaired learning and memory, reduced activity, increased anxiety and 
      reduced sociability; with PA1 mice generally displaying greater behavioural 
      deficits in keeping with the more severe phenotype reported in patients. In 
      agreement with previous reports, 70% of PA1 males exhibit myoclonic seizures by 
      two months of age, with the first observed at P18. In this report, we show 80% of 
      PA2 males also display myoclonic seizures, with the first observed at P19. 
      Consistent with patient phenotypes, we observe large variations in seizure 
      progression and severity for both PA1 and PA2 individual mice. The generation of 
      this comprehensive baseline data is a necessary step on the path to the 
      development of therapies to improve patient outcomes.

AB  - The Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene encodes a paired-type homeodomain 
      transcription factor with critical roles in embryonic development. Mutations in 
      ARX give rise to intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy and brain malformation 
      syndromes. To capture the genetics and molecular disruptions that underpin the 
      ARX-associated clinical phenotypes, we undertook a transcriptome wide RNASeq 
      approach to analyse developing (12.5 dpc) telencephalon of mice modelling two 
      recurrent polyalanine expansion mutations with different phenotypic severities in 
      the ARX gene. Here we report 238 genes significantly deregulated 
      (Log2FC  > +/-1.1, P-value <0.05) when both mutations are compared to wild-type 
      (WT) animals. When each mutation is considered separately, a greater number of 
      genes were deregulated in the severe PA1 mice (825) than in the PA2 animals (78). 
      Analysing genes deregulated in either or both mutant strains, we identified 12% 
      as implicated in ID, epilepsy and autism (99/858), with  approximately 5% of them as putative 
      or known direct targets of ARX transcriptional regulation. We propose a core 
      pathway of transcription regulators, including Hdac4, involved in chromatin 
      condensation and transcriptional repression, and one of its targets, the 
      transcription factor Twist1, as potential drivers of the ID and infantile spasms 
      in patients with ARX polyalanine expansion mutations. We predict that the 
      subsequent disturbance to this pathway is a consequence of ARX protein reduction 
      with a broader and more significant level of disruption in the PA1 in comparison 
      to the PA2 mice. Identifying early triggers of ARX-associated phenotypes 
      contributes to our understanding of particular clusters/pathways underpinning 
      comorbid phenotypes that are shared by many neurodevelopmental disorders.

LID - 10.1038/nsmb.3127 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine (polyGln) expansions in nine human proteins result in neurological 
      diseases and induce the proteins' tendency to form beta-rich amyloid fibrils and 
      intracellular deposits. Less well known are at least nine other human diseases 
      caused by polyalanine (polyAla)-expansion mutations in different proteins. The 
      mechanisms of how polyAla aggregates under physiological conditions remain 
      unclear and controversial. We show here that aggregation of polyAla is 
      mechanistically dissimilar to that of polyGln and hence does not exhibit amyloid 
      kinetics. PolyAla assembled spontaneously into alpha-helical clusters with diverse 
      oligomeric states. Such clustering was pervasive in cells irrespective of visible 
      aggregate formation, and it disrupted the normal physiological oligomeric state 
      of two human proteins natively containing polyAla: ARX and SOX3. This 
      self-assembly pattern indicates that polyAla expansions chronically disrupt 
      protein behavior by imposing a deranged oligomeric status.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Severe congenital diarrhea occurs in approximately half of patients 
      with Aristaless-Related Homeobox (ARX) null mutations. The cause of this diarrhea 
      is unknown. In a mouse model of intestinal Arx deficiency, the prevalence of a 
      subset of enteroendocrine cells is altered, leading to diarrhea. Because 
      polyalanine expansions within the ARX protein are the most common mutations found 
      in ARX-related disorders, we sought to characterize the enteroendocrine 
      population in human tissue of an ARX mutation and in a mouse model of the 
      corresponding polyalanine expansion (Arx). METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and 
      quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were the primary modalities used 
      to characterize the enteroendocrine populations. Daily weights were determined 
      for the growth curves, and Oil-Red-O staining on stool and tissue identified 
      neutral fats. RESULTS: An expansion of 7 alanines in the first polyalanine tract 
      of both human ARX and mouse Arx altered enteroendocrine differentiation. In human 
      tissue, cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide 1, and somatostatin populations 
      were reduced, whereas the chromogranin A population was unchanged. In the mouse 
      model, cholecystokinin and glucagon-like peptide 1 populations were also lost, 
      although the somatostatin-expressing population was increased. The ARX protein 
      was present in human tissue, whereas the Arx protein was degraded in the mouse 
      intestine. CONCLUSIONS: ARX/Arx is required for the specification of a subset of 
      enteroendocrine cells in both humans and mice. Owing to protein degradation, the 
      Arx mouse recapitulates findings of the intestinal Arx null model, but is not 
      able to further the study of the differential effects of the ARX protein on its 
      transcriptional targets in the intestine.

AB  - ARX/Arx is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor necessary for the 
      specification and early maintenance of pancreatic endocrine alpha-cells. Many 
      transcription factors important to pancreas development, including ARX/Arx, are 
      also crucial for proper brain development. Although null mutations of ARX in 
      human patients result in the severe neurologic syndrome XLAG (X-linked 
      lissencephaly associated with abnormal genitalia), the most common mutation is 
      the expansion of the first polyalanine tract of ARX, which results primarily in 
      the clinical syndrome ISSX (infantile spasms). Mouse models of XLAG, ISSX and 
      other human ARX mutations demonstrate a direct genotype-phenotype correlation in 
      ARX-related neurologic disorders. Furthermore, mouse models utilizing a 
      polyalanine tract expansion mutation have illustrated critical developmental 
      differences between null mutations and expansion mutations in the brain, 
      revealing context-specific defects. Although Arx is known to be required for the 
      specification and early maintenance of pancreatic glucagon-producing alpha-cells, the 
      consequences of the Arx polyalanine expansion on pancreas development remain 
      unknown. Here we report that mice with an expansion mutation in the first 
      polyalanine tract of Arx exhibit impaired alpha-cell specification and maintenance, 
      with gradual alpha-cell loss due to apoptosis. This is in contrast to the 
      re-specification of alpha-cells into beta- and delta-cells that occurs in mice null for Arx. 
      Overall, our analysis of an Arx polyalanine expansion mutation on pancreatic 
      development suggests that impaired alpha-cell function might also occur in ISSX 
      patients.

TI  - ARX regulates cortical intermediate progenitor cell expansion and upper layer 
      neuron formation through repression of Cdkn1c.
PG  - 322-35
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bht222 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene are found in a spectrum 
      of epilepsy and X-linked intellectual disability disorders. During development 
      Arx is expressed in pallial ventricular zone (VZ) progenitor cells where the 
      excitatory projection neurons of the cortex are born. Arx(-/Y) mice were shown to 
      have decreased proliferation in the cortical VZ resulting in smaller brains; 
      however, the basis for this reduced proliferation was not established. To 
      determine the role of ARX on cell cycle dynamics in cortical progenitor cells, we 
      generated cerebral cortex-specific Arx mouse mutants (cKO). The loss of pallial 
      Arx resulted in the reduction of cortical progenitor cells, particularly the 
      proliferation of intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs) was affected. Later in 
      development and postnatally cKO brains showed a reduction of upper layer but not 
      deeper layer neurons consistent with the IPC defect. Transcriptional profile 
      analysis of E14.5 Arx-ablated cortices compared with control revealed that 
      CDKN1C, an inhibitor of cell cycle progression, is overexpressed in the cortical 
      VZ and SVZ of Arx KOs throughout corticogenesis. We also identified ARX as a 
      direct regulator of Cdkn1c transcription. Together these data support a model 
      where ARX regulates the expansion of cortical progenitor cells through repression 
      of Cdkn1c.

AB  - Intellectual disability (ID) and epilepsy often occur together and have a 
      dramatic impact on the development and quality of life of the affected children. 
      Polyalanine (polyA)-expansion-encoding mutations of aristaless-related homeobox 
      (ARX) cause a spectrum of X-linked ID (XLID) diseases and chronic epilepsy, 
      including infantile spasms. We show that lysine-specific demethylase 5C (KDM5C), 
      a gene known to be mutated in XLID-affected children and involved in chromatin 
      remodeling, is directly regulated by ARX through the binding in a conserved 
      noncoding element. We have studied altered ARX carrying various polyA elongations 
      in individuals with XLID and/or epilepsy. The changes in polyA repeats cause 
      hypomorphic ARX alterations, which exhibit a decreased trans-activity and 
      reduced, but not abolished, binding to the KDM5C regulatory region. The altered 
      functioning of the mutants tested is likely to correlate with the severity of 
      XLID and/or epilepsy. By quantitative RT-PCR, we observed a dramatic Kdm5c mRNA 
      downregulation in murine Arx-knockout embryonic and neural stem cells. Such Kdm5c 
      mRNA diminution led to a severe decrease in the KDM5C content during in vitro 
      neuronal differentiation, which inversely correlated with an increase in H3K4me3 
      signal. We established that ARX polyA alterations damage the regulation of KDM5C 
      expression, and we propose a potential ARX-dependent path acting via chromatin 
      remodeling.

TI  - An epilepsy-related ARX polyalanine expansion modifies glutamatergic neurons 
      excitability and morphology without affecting GABAergic neurons development.
PG  - 1484-94
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhs138 [doi]
AB  - Epileptic encephalopathies comprise a heterogeneous group of severe infantile 
      disorders for which the pathophysiological basis of epilepsy is inaccurately 
      clarified by genotype-phenotype analysis. Because a deficit of GABA neurons has 
      been found in some of these syndromes, notably in patients with X-linked 
      lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia, epilepsy was suggested to result from an 
      imbalance in GABAergic inhibition, and the notion of "interneuronopathy" was 
      proposed. Here, we studied the impact of a polyalanine expansion of 
      aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene, a mutation notably found in West and 
      Ohtahara syndromes. Analysis of Arx((GCG)7/Y) knock-in mice revealed that GABA 
      neuron development is not affected. Moreover, pyramidal cell migration and 
      cortical layering are unaltered in these mice. Interestingly, 
      electrophysiological recordings show that hippocampal pyramidal neurons displayed 
      a frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents similar to wild-type (WT) mice. 
      However, these neurons show a dramatic increase in the frequency of excitatory 
      inputs associated with a remodeling of their axonal arborization, suggesting that 
      epilepsy in Arx((GCG)7/Y)mice would result from a glutamate network remodeling. 
      We therefore propose that secondary alterations are instrumental for the 
      development of disease-specific phenotypes and should be considered to explain 
      the phenotypic diversity associated with epileptogenic mutations.

      development and gene expression.

LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddr538 [doi]
AB  - Polyalanine (poly-A) tracts exist in 494 annotated proteins; to date, expansions 
      in these tracts have been associated with nine human diseases. The pathogenetic 
      mechanism by which a poly-A tract results in these various human disorders 
      remains uncertain. To understand the role of this mutation type, we investigated 
      the change in functional properties of the transcription factor Arx when it has 
      an expanded poly-A tract (Arx(E)), a mutation associated with infantile spasms 
      and intellectual disabilities in humans. We found that although Arx(E) functions 
      normally in the dorsal brain, its function in subpallial-derived populations of 
      neurons is compromised. These contrasting functions are associated with the 
      misregulation of Arx targets through the loss of the ability of Arx(E) to 
      interact with the Arx cofactor Tle1. Our data demonstrate a novel mechanism for 
      poly-A expansion diseases: the misregulation of a subset of target genes normally 
      regulated by a transcription factor.

TI  - ARX polyalanine expansions are highly implicated in familial cases of mental 
      retardation with infantile epilepsy and/or hand dystonia.
PG  - 98-105
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.33785 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the ARX gene cause both nonsyndromic and several forms of syndromic 
      mental retardation (MR). Two polyalanine (polyA) expansions of ARX are recurrent 
      mutations. The most common one, the c.428_451dup, is associated with a wide 
      spectrum of phenotypes, ranging from the most severe West syndrome to Partington 
      syndrome (MR and hand dystonia), and even nonsyndromic X-linked mental 
      retardation (NS-XLMR). Studies of patients not selected for specific clinical 
      signs showed that the c.428_451dup is relatively frequent in families harboring 
      X-linked MR (7.5%), but less common in familial cases compatible with X-linked NR 
      (1%), and very rare in sporadic cases (0.1%). The c.333_334ins(GCG)7 expansion is 
      less frequent and mainly associated with West syndrome. We screened for both ARX 
      polyA expansions in 98 unrelated patients selected for the presence of NR 
      associated with different types of epilepsy and/or with hand dystonia. We also 
      studied two families with an initial diagnosis of NS-XLMR, one of which was 
      identified as showing linkage to the ARX locus. The c.428_451dup was identified 
      in three patients and the c.333_334ins(GCG)7 in one; all of the patients were 
      from families with two affected brothers. We also found the c.428_451dup in the 
      family linked to ARX, and clinical re-evaluation showed subtle, previously 
      undetected signs. Our study illustrates that ARX polyA expansions are primarily 
      associated with syndromic MR and shows a higher yield (18% in our cohort) when 
      these mutations are screened in familial cases of MR with epilepsy and/or 
      dystonia.

TI  - Human lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia due to mutations in TUBA1A: 
      expansion of the foetal neuropathological phenotype.
PG  - 779-89
LID - 10.1007/s00401-010-0684-z [doi]
AB  - Neuronal migration disorders account for a substantial number of cortical 
      malformations, the most severe forms being represented by lissencephalies. 
      Classical lissencephaly has been shown to result from mutations in LIS1 
      (PAFAH1B1; MIM#601545), DCX (Doublecortin; MIM#300121), ARX (Aristaless-related 
      homeobox gene; MIM#300382), RELN (Reelin; MIM#600514) and VLDLR (Very low density 
      lipoprotein receptor; MIM#224050). More recently, de novo missense mutations in 
      the alpha-tubulin 1a gene (TUBA1A) located on chromosome 12q13.12, have also been 
      associated with more or less severe defects of cortical development, resulting in 
      complete agyria in the most severe cases of lissencephaly. We report here the 
      cerebral lesions in a 36 weeks' gestation female foetus with a novel de novo 
      missense mutation in the TUBA1A gene, presenting the most severe antenatal 
      phenotype reported so far. Using routine immunohistochemistry and confocal 
      microscopy, we show evidence for defects in axonal transport in addition to 
      defects in neuronal migration and differentiation, giving new insights to the 
      pathophysiology of this form of lissencephaly.

TI  - A triplet repeat expansion genetic mouse model of infantile spasms syndrome, 
      Arx(GCG)10+7, with interneuronopathy, spasms in infancy, persistent seizures, and 
      adult cognitive and behavioral impairment.
PG  - 8752-63
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0915-09.2009 [doi]
AB  - Infantile spasms syndrome (ISS) is a catastrophic pediatric epilepsy with motor 
      spasms, persistent seizures, mental retardation, and in some cases, autism. One 
      of its monogenic causes is an insertion mutation [c.304ins (GCG)(7)] on the X 
      chromosome, expanding the first polyalanine tract of the interneuron-specific 
      transcription factor Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) from 16 to 23 alanine 
      codons. Null mutation of the Arx gene impairs GABA and cholinergic interneuronal 
      migration but results in a neonatal lethal phenotype. We developed the first 
      viable genetic mouse model of ISS that spontaneously recapitulates salient 
      phenotypic features of the human triplet repeat expansion mutation. 
      Arx((GCG)10+7) ("Arx plus 7") pups display abnormal spasm-like myoclonus and 
      other key EEG features, including multifocal spikes, electrodecremental episodes, 
      and spontaneous seizures persisting into maturity. The neurobehavioral profile of 
      Arx mutants was remarkable for lowered anxiety, impaired associative learning, 
      and abnormal social interaction. Laminar decreases of Arx+ cortical interneurons 
      and a selective reduction of calbindin-, but not parvalbumin- or 
      calretinin-expressing interneurons in neocortical layers and hippocampus indicate 
      that specific classes of synaptic inhibition are missing from the adult 
      forebrain, providing a basis for the seizures and cognitive disorder. A 
      significant reduction of calbindin-, NPY (neuropeptide Y)-expressing, and 
      cholinergic interneurons in the mutant striatum suggest that dysinhibition within 
      this network may contribute to the dyskinetic motor spasms. This mouse model 
      narrows the range of critical pathogenic elements within brain inhibitory 
      networks essential to recreate this complex neurodevelopmental syndrome.

TI  - Polymorphisms of coding trinucleotide repeats of homeogenes in neurodevelopmental 
      psychiatric disorders.
PG  - 295-301
LID - 10.1097/YPG.0b013e3283060fa5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Autism (MIM#209850) and schizophrenia (MIM#181500) are both 
      neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders characterized by a highly genetic 
      component. Homeogenes and forkhead genes encode transcription factors, which have 
      been involved in brain development and cell differentiation. Thus, they are 
      relevant candidate genes for psychiatric disorders. Genetic studies have reported 
      an association between autism and DLX2, HOXA1, EN2, ARX, and FOXP2 genes whereas 
      only three studies of EN2, OTX2, and FOXP2 were performed on schizophrenia. 
      Interestingly, most of these candidate genes contain trinucleotide repeats coding 
      for polyamino acid stretch in which instability can be the cause of 
      neurodevelopmental disorders. Our goal was to identify variations of coding 
      trinucleotide repeats in schizophrenia, autism, and idiopathic mental 
      retardation. METHODS: We screened the coding trinucleotide repeats of OTX1, EN1, 
      DLX2, HOXA1, and FOXP2 genes in populations suffering from schizophrenia (247 
      patients), autism (98 patients), and idiopathic mental retardation (56 patients), 
      and compared them with control populations (112 super controls and 202 healthy 
      controls). RESULTS: Novel deletions and insertions of coding trinucleotide 
      repeats were found in the DLX2, HOXA1, and FOXP2 genes. Most of these variations 
      were detected in controls and no difference in their distribution was observed 
      between patient and control groups. Two different polymorphisms in FOXP2 were, 
      however, found only in autistic patients and the functional consequences of these 
      variations of repeats have to be characterized and correlated to particular 
      clinical features. CONCLUSION: This study did not identify specific disease risk 
      variants of trinucleotide repeats in OTX1, EN1, DLX2, HOXA1, and FOXP2 candidate 
      genes in neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Mutations in the Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) gene are associated with 
      pleiotropic phenotypes including infantile spasms, mental retardation and 
      dystonia. However, relatively consistent genotype-phenotype correlations have 
      been emphasized in prior reports. We report a boy presenting with mental 
      retardation, tonic seizures and dystonia but without infantile spasms. Gene 
      sequencing detected an additional seven GCG repeats in the first polyalanine 
      tract of the ARX gene, a mutation which leads to an expansion of the normal 16 
      alanine residues to 23. The same ARX gene mutation has been reported in patients 
      with infantile spasms, but was absent in the present case. This finding 
      highlights the diverse phenotypic spectrum that may result from ARX gene 
      mutations.

AB  - We present four patients with ARX mutations and widely variant clinical 
      presentations. Case 1, a female with a known ARX mutation has refractory 
      infantile spasms and severe mental retardation. Case 2, a male presented with a 
      neurodegenerative disorder and has a known ARX mutation likely de novo as mother 
      is not a carrier. Cases 3 and 4, two siblings with a novel variant in ARX, which 
      is not clearly pathogenic, have developmental delay. One of the siblings had a 
      diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder, failure to thrive with severe feeding 
      difficulties, intracranial hemorrhage, and seizures. There are very few affected 
      females with ARX related infantile spasms. These cases expand the known phenotype 
      of this emerging condition.

TI  - A longer polyalanine expansion mutation in the ARX gene causes early infantile 
      epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst pattern (Ohtahara syndrome).
PG  - 361-6
AB  - Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression-burst pattern (EIEE) is 
      one of the most severe and earliest forms of epilepsy, often evolving into West 
      syndrome; however, the pathogenesis of EIEE remains unclear. ARX is a crucial 
      gene for the development of interneurons in the fetal brain, and a polyalanine 
      expansion mutation of ARX causes mental retardation and seizures, including those 
      of West syndrome, in males. We screened the ARX mutation and found a hemizygous, 
      de novo, 33-bp duplication in exon 2, 298_330dupGCGGCA(GCG)9, in two of three 
      unrelated male patients with EIEE. This mutation is thought to expand the 
      original 16 alanine residues to 27 alanine residues (A110_A111insAAAAAAAAAAA) in 
      the first polyalanine tract of the ARX protein. Although EIEE is mainly 
      associated with brain malformations, ARX is the first gene found to be 
      responsible for idiopathic EIEE. Our observation that EIEE had a longer expansion 
      of the polyalanine tract than is seen in West syndrome is consistent with the 
      findings of earlier onset and more-severe phenotypes in EIEE than in West 
      syndrome.

TI  - Expansion of the first PolyA tract of ARX causes infantile spasms and status 
      dystonicus.
PG  - 427-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: ARX is a paired-type homeobox gene located on the X chromosome that 
      contains five exons with four polyalanine (PolyA) tracts, a homeodomain, and a 
      conserved C-terminal aristaless domain. Studies in humans have demonstrated 
      remarkable pleiotropy: malformation phenotypes are associated with protein 
      truncation mutations and missense mutations in the homeobox; nonmalformation 
      phenotypes, including X-linked infantile spasms (ISS), are associated with 
      missense mutations outside of the homeobox and expansion of the PolyA tracts. 
      OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of ARX, we performed mutation analysis in 115 
      boys with cryptogenic ISS. This included two pairs of brothers. RESULTS: We found 
      an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat that codes for the first PolyA tract 
      from 10 to 17 GCG repeats (c.333_334ins[GCG]7) in six boys (5.2%) ages 2 to 14, 
      from four families, including the two pairs of brothers. In addition to ISS, all 
      six boys had severe mental retardation and generalized dystonia that appeared 
      around the age of 6 months and worsened, eventually leading to stable severe 
      quadriplegic dyskinesia within age 2 years. Three children experienced recurrent, 
      life-threatening status dystonicus. In four children brain MRI showed multiple 
      small foci of abnormal cavitation on T1 and increased signal intensity on T2 in 
      the putamina, possibly reflecting progressive multifocal loss of tissue. 
      CONCLUSION: The phenotype of infantile spasms with severe dyskinetic 
      quadriparesis increases the number of human disorders that result from the 
      pathologic expansion of single alanine repeats. ARX gene testing should be 
      considered in boys with infantile spasms and dyskinetic cerebral palsy in the 
      absence of a consistent perinatal history.

TI  - MRX87 family with Aristaless X dup24bp mutation and implication for polyAlanine 
      expansions.
PG  - 25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairments are heterogeneous conditions, and it is 
      estimated that 10% may be caused by a defect of mental function genes on the X 
      chromosome. One of those genes is Aristaless related homeobox (ARX) encoding a 
      polyA-rich homeobox transcription factor essential for cerebral patterning and 
      its mutations cause different neurologic disorders. We reported on the clinical 
      and genetic analysis of an Italian family with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) 
      and intra-familial heterogeneity, and provided insight into its molecular defect. 
      METHODS: We carried out on linkage-candidate gene studies in a new MRX family 
      (MRX87). All coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of ARX gene were analysed 
      by direct sequencing. RESULTS: MRX87 patients had moderate to profound cognition 
      impairment and a combination of minor congenital anomalies. The disease locus, 
      MRX87, was mapped between DXS7104 and DXS1214, placing it in Xp22-p21 interval, a 
      hot spot region for mental handicap. An in frame duplication of 24 bp (ARXdup24) 
      in the second polyAlanine tract (polyA_II) in ARX was identified. CONCLUSION: Our 
      study underlines the role of ARXdup24 as a critical mutational site causing 
      mental retardation linked to Xp22. Phenotypic heterogeneity of MRX87 patients 
      represents a new observation relevant to the functional consequences of 
      polyAlanine expansions enriching the puzzling complexity of ARXdup24-linked 
      diseases.

      increased cell death.
PG  - 411-6
AB  - A growing number of human disorders have been associated with expansions of a 
      tract of a single amino acid. Recently, polyalanine (polyA) tract expansions in 
      the Aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) protein have been identified in a subset of 
      patients with infantile spasms and mental retardation. How alanine expansions in 
      ARX, or any other transcription factor, cause disease have not been determined. 
      We generated a series of polyA expansions in Arx and expressed these in cell 
      culture and brain slices. Transfection of these constructs results in nuclear 
      protein aggregation, filamentous nuclear inclusions, and an increase in cell 
      death. These inclusions are ubiquitinated and recruit Hsp70. Coexpressing Hsp70 
      decreases the percentage of cells with nuclear inclusions. Finally, we show that 
      expressing mutant Arx in mouse brains results in neuronal nuclear inclusion 
      formation. Our data suggest expansions in one of the ARX polyA tracts results in 
      nuclear protein aggregation and an increase in cell death; likely underlying the 
      pathogenesis of the associated infantile spasms and mental retardation.
