AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by repeat expansion of the CAG trinucleotide within exon 10 of the 
      ATXN3 gene. This mutation results in the production of an abnormal ataxin-3 
      protein containing an extended polyglutamine tract, referred to as mutant 
      ataxin-3. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of 
      CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing for SCA3. First, we designed a specific 
      single-guide RNA targeting the ATXN3 gene and constructed the corresponding 
      targeting vector. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from a SCA3 
      patient were then electroporated with the CRISPR/Cas9 components. Positive clones 
      were screened and validated by PCR and Sanger sequencing to obtain genome-editing 
      iPSCs (GE-iPSCs). Subsequently, the pluripotency of GE-iPSCs was confirmed, and 
      the effects of genome editing on mutant ataxin-3 protein expression and Golgi 
      apparatus morphology were assessed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence 
      analyses. Our results demonstrated that targeted insertion of polyadenylation 
      signals (PAS) upstream of the abnormal CAG repeats effectively suppressed the 
      production of mutant ataxin-3. This intervention also reduced the formation of 
      neuronal nuclear inclusions in differentiated neurons, restored the structural 
      integrity of the Golgi apparatus (which exhibited a loose and enlarged morphology 
      in SCA3 cells), and increased the expression levels of Golgi structural proteins 
      (GM130 and GORASP2). In conclusion, our findings indicate that the targeted 
      insertion of PAS upstream of the abnormal CAG repeats in the ATXN3 gene 
      represents a promising therapeutic strategy for SCA3 through genome editing.

PG  - e70093

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fatigue is a significant symptom in patients with spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 3 (SCA3). This study explores the role of fatigue in SCA3, examining 
      its impact on quality of life and its potential as an indicator of disease 
      progression. METHODS: We prospectively recruited 128 molecularly confirmed SCA3 
      patients and 125 sex-, age-, and education-matched healthy controls (HCs). Age at 
      onset, disease duration, length of normal and expanded CAG repeats, and 14-item 
      Fatigue Scale score were compared. MRIs evaluated the cerebellum and brain 
      lesions. RESULTS: Our study found that the preataxic SCA3 group exhibited lower 
      fatigue incidence and score than HCs (Incidence: 13% vs. 36%, p = 0.031; FS-14 
      score: 3.0 +/- 2.7 vs. 5.6 +/- 2.8, p < 0.001). Ataxic SCA3 patients experienced 
      significantly higher fatigue incidence and score compared to both the preataxic 
      SCA3 group (Incidence: 63.8% vs. 13%, p < 0.001; FS-14 score: 8.1 +/- 3.9 vs. 
      3.0 +/- 2.7, p < 0.001) and HCs (Incidence: 63.8% vs. 36%, p < 0.001; FS-14 score: 
      8.1 +/- 3.9 vs. 5.6 +/- 2.8, p < 0.001). Moreover, fatigue severity in SCA3 
      correlated with disease duration and expanded CAG repeat length. Neuroanatomical 
      correlations revealed volume reductions in cortical and cerebellar regions linked 
      to higher physical and mental fatigue scores in SCA3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Monitoring fatigue effectively evaluates a patient's overall quality of life and 
      disease progression, making it a key indicator. Future treatments can target 
      specific brain regions, with their effectiveness being evaluated through FS-14 
      assessments of fatigue changes.

TI  - Whole Genome Sequencing-Based Diagnosis of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 Repeat 
      Expansion Neuromuscular Disorders in an Undiagnosed Patient: Breaking Past 
      Diagnostic Boundaries.
LID - 10.4103/neurol-india.Neurol-India-D-24-00552 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a neuromuscular disorder 
      (NMD) that is a complicated and progressive genetic disorder. SCA3 is 
      predominantly caused by repeat expansions (REs) of short tandem repeats (STRs). 
      SCA3 is caused by a CAG repeat expansion of the ATXN3 gene and is transmitted in 
      an autosomal dominant manner and located on chromosomal position 14q32. 
      OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify the ATNX3 gene and assess 
      the clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing (WGS) in finding REs in 
      previously undiagnosed patients with SCA3 for better management. METHODS AND 
      MATERIALS: Thirty-three referral cases for SCA3 were analyzed using WGS and 
      triplet-repeat PCR (TP-PCR) techniques to detect REs for the ATXN3 gene. RESULTS: 
      A case of SCA3 was discovered to be positive for the ATXN3 gene for 59 CAG REs 
      revealed by WGS and validated by TP-PCR. This mutation was found in a 26-year-old 
      male patient who had previously been undiagnosed by other genetic tests. 
      CONCLUSION: To identify REs in the ATXN3 gene by validating WGS with previously 
      inconclusive genetic tests, the study propose that WGS could potentially be 
      implemented as the frontline, cost-effective, less turnaround time molecular 
      testing for more accurate diagnoses and better-informed treatment strategies.

AB  - Abnormal trinucleotide CAG repeat expansions in exon 10 of the ataxin-3 (ATXN3) 
      gene has been identified as the cause of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3). We 
      generated and characterized a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line 
      from skin fibroblasts of a patient with genetically confirmed SCA3. The 
      pluripotency of these iPSCs was verified by the expression of several 
      undifferentiated hPSCs markers at both RNA and protein levels, as well as their 
      capability to differentiate into all three germ layers.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), a neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      excess CAG repeats in the ATXN3 gene, leads to progressive cerebellar ataxia and 
      other symptoms. The results of previous studies suggest that trace element 
      dysregulation contributes to neurodegenerative disorder onset. Here, we 
      investigated the relationships of trace element dysregulation with CAG repeat 
      length, clinical severity, and brain structural and functional connectivity in 45 
      patients with SCA3 and 44 healthy controls (HCs). Blood levels of lithium (Li), 
      selenium (Se), and copper (Cu) were significantly lower in patients with SCA3 
      than in HCs; Li and Se levels were negatively correlated with CAG repeat length, 
      especially in the manifest subgroup. Diffusion tensor imaging combined with 
      resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed that Li levels were 
      negatively correlated with fractional anisotropy in the white matter (WM) of 
      bilateral frontal and parietal regions; tractography mapping showed disorder 
      structural connectivity of Li-associated region nerve fiber pathways in patients 
      with SCA3. Dynamic causal modeling analyses showed bidirectional causal 
      connectivity from the inferior parietal lobule(IPL) to the cerebellum was 
      significantly correlated with the blood level of Li in patients with SCA3. Time 
      series correlation-based functional connectivity analysis revealed that the 
      intrinsic connectivities of the bilateral dorsal premotor cortex(PMd) and IPL 
      with local cerebellar regions were significantly weaker in patients with SCA3 
      than in HCs. Our results suggest that trace element dysregulation, especially Li 
      deficiency, induces brain alterations and clinical manifestations in patients 
      with SCA3; Li supplementation may be beneficial for WM or astrocytes in this 
      patient population.

TI  - ATXN10 Gene Expansions in Mexican Patients with Ataxia Without Epilepsy.
PG  - 33
LID - 10.1007/s12311-024-01784-w [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal dominant (AD) 
      neurodegenerative disorder prevalent in the Americas, particularly in Mexico. 
      Clinical manifestations include progressive ataxia and epilepsy. However, it can 
      exhibit wide phenotypic variability and even reduced penetrance. Because the 
      diagnostic overlaps with other ataxias, molecular diagnosis is essential. This 
      cross-sectional study conducted a retrospective review and analysis of 183 DNA 
      samples from a laboratory registry of patients with ataxia who were suspected of 
      having AD ataxia (n = 86; negative for ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, TBP, and ATN1 
      genes) or sporadic ataxia (n = 97). Triplet repeat-primed PCR (TP-PCR) was 
      performed to identify ATXN10 gene expansions. 19.6% (n = 36) of the samples 
      showed ATXN10 expansions, with a higher proportion of hereditary AD cases (30.2%; 
      n = 26) compared to sporadic cases (10.3%; n = 10). Clinical information was 
      available in only 23 registries, with manifestations predominantly including 
      cerebellar signs, but notably not epilepsy. The frequency of SCA10 in our country 
      underlines the need to change the diagnostic suspicion, as the absence of 
      epilepsy challenges previous diagnostic assumptions. As this is a study from a 
      laboratory registry, we are aware of certain limitations.

TI  - Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele is associated with better performance language

AB  - BACKGROUND: The regulatory role of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele in the 
      clinical manifestations of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) remains unclear. 
      This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the APOE epsilon4 allele on cognitive and 
      motor functions in SCA3 patients. METHODS: This study included 281 unrelated SCA3 
      patients and 182 controls. APOE genotypes were analyzed using PCR amplification 
      combined with Sanger sequencing. Additionally, 96 SCA3 patients were 
      prospectively recruited for neuropsychological and motor function assessments. 
      Neuropsychological phenotypes were evaluated using the modified Chinese version 
      of the Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in Multiple Sclerosis (MACFIMS). 
      Motor function was assessed using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of 
      Ataxia (SARA) and the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). 
      RESULTS: The frequency of the APOE epsilon4 allele was increased in SCA3 patients 
      compared to the control group. The APOE epsilon4 allele was associated with better 
      performance in language and visual memory, but also with more severe speech 
      disturbances in SCA3 patients. Furthermore, in SCA3, the expanded CAG repeat 
      length was correlated with poorer language memory performance and slower 
      information processing speed, as well as more severe gait disturbances, fast 
      alternating hand movements, speech disturbance, and oculomotor disorders. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The APOE epsilon4 allele may serve as a disease-modifying factor in SCA3, 
      influencing both cognitive and motor functions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported that expanded GCA repeats in the GLS 
      gene can cause glutaminase deficiency with ataxia phenotype. However, to data, no 
      studies have investigated the distribution and role of GCA repeats in the GLS 
      gene of Chinese individuals. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the 
      distribution of GCA repeats in Chinese individuals, including undiagnosed ataxia 
      patients for identifying causal factors, healthy controls for determining the 
      normal range, and ATX-ATXN3 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, SCA3) patients for 
      exploring genetic modifiers. METHODS: We combined whole-genome sequencing (WGS), 
      repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction, capillary electrophoresis (RP-PCR/CE), 
      and ExpansionHunter to screen the GCA repeats in the GLS gene of 349 undiagnosed 
      ataxia individuals, 1505 healthy controls, and 1236 ATX-ATXN3 (SCA3) patients 
      from mainland China. RESULTS: No expanded GCA repeats in the GLS gene were 
      detected across any of the samples. The average number of GCA repeats was 11 
      (range: 8-31), 12 (range: 6-33), and 11 (range: 6-33) for undiagnosed ataxia 
      patients, healthy controls, and SCA3 patients, respectively. The intermediate 
      repeat size (9 < repeat size </= 13) of the nonexpanded GCA allele in the GLS gene 
      was associated with later disease onset in ATX-ATXN3 (SCA3) patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal expansions of GLS GCA repeats are rare in the Chinese 
      population. However, intermediate-length normal GCA repeat sizes may influence 
      the age at onset (AAO) in ATX-ATXN3 (SCA3) patients. (c) 2024 International

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Late-onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA) is a slowly progressive cerebellar 
      disorder with symptom onset >/=30years of age. Intronic tandem repeat expansions 
      (TREs) in RFC1 and FGF14 have recently emerged as common causes of LOCA. The 
      relative contribution of classic vs. newly discovered TREs has not been 
      systematically investigated in LOCA cohorts. METHODS: Over 28 years, 206 
      consecutive Greek LOCA index patients were referred for genetic testing and, 
      based on clinical data and inheritance pattern, screened for FRDA, SCA1,2,3,6,7, 
      FXTAS, CANVAS and SCA27B. RESULTS: A genetic diagnosis was reached in 62 of 206 
      cases (30.1 %). Mean age was 60.1 +/- 11.2 (35-87) years and mean age at onset 
      (AAO) 52.5 +/- 11.4 (30-80) years. SCA27B accounted for 9.7 % of LOCA cases, CANVAS 
      for 7.8 % and FRDA for 4.4 %. The overall frequency of SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 was 
      6.8 %. No cases of SCA3 and SCA6 were identified. FXTAS contributed 1.5 % of 
      cases. In sporadic cases, the diagnostic yield was 22.8 % (34 of 149; SCA27B: 
      8.7 %, CANVAS: 8.1 %, FRDA: 2.7 %, SCA2: 1.3 %, FXTAS: 1.3 % and SCA7: 0.7 %). In 
      familial cases, the diagnostic yield was 49.1 % (28 of 57). Two cases with CANVAS 
      had pseudodominant inheritance. Patients with SCA27B, CANVAS and FXTAS had mean 
      AAO > 50 years, whereas patients with FRDA, SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 had mean 
      AAO < 50 years. CONCLUSION: Recently-discovered TREs causing SCA27B and CANVAS 
      represent the commonest known genetic causes of LOCA. Prioritizing testing for 
      FGF14 and RFC1 expansions in the diagnostic algorithm of LOCA is recommended.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph 
      disease, is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG repeat 
      expansion in exon 10 of ATXN3. Extra-cerebellar manifestations, including 
      external ophthalmoplegia, dystonia, Parkinsonism, and peripheral neuropathy, are 
      predominantly present in SCA3 cases. Here, we report a case of SCA3 presenting 
      with a split hand and minipolymyoclonus. CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old female 
      patient presented with a 5-year history of ataxic gait. Neurological examination 
      revealed cerebellar ataxia and minipolymyoclonus in the digits on both sides and 
      muscle atrophy in the right hand, consistent with the split hand pattern. 
      Electrodiagnostic studies demonstrated decreased amplitude of compound muscle 
      action potentials and neurogenic motor unit potentials, indicating lower motor 
      neuron involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient's case indicated a split hand and 
      minipolymyoclonus in SCA3. Clinicians should consider these extra-cerebellar 
      manifestations in patients with SCA3. Although neither split hand nor 
      minipolymyoclonus are likely to directly result in a specific etiological 
      diagnosis, a common pathophysiological mechanism for both may be lower motor 
      neuron involvement. This extracerebellar manifestation contributes to narrowing 
      down the diagnostic possibilities for cases presenting with progressive 
      cerebellar ataxia.

AB  - Currently, routine diagnostics for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) look for polyQ 
      repeat expansions and conventional variations affecting the proteins encoded by 
      known SCA genes. However, ~40% of the patients still remain without a genetic 
      diagnosis after routine tests. Increasing evidence suggests that variations in 
      the enhancer regions of genes involved in neurodegenerative disorders can also 
      cause disease. Since the enhancers of SCA genes are not yet known, it remains to 
      be determined whether variations in these regions are a cause of SCA. In this 
      pilot project, we aimed to identify the enhancers of the SCA genes ATXN1, ATXN3, 
      TBP and ITPR1 in the human cerebellum using 4C-seq, publicly available datasets, 
      reciprocal 4C-seq, and luciferase assays. We then screened these enhancers for 
      copy number variants (CNVs) in a cohort of genetically undiagnosed SCA patients. 
      We identified two active enhancers for each of the four SCA genes. CNV analysis 
      did not reveal any CNVs in the enhancers of the four SCA genes in the genetically 
      undiagnosed SCA patients. However, in one patient, we noted a CNV deletion with 
      an unknown clinical significance near one of the ITPR1 enhancers. These results 
      not only reveal elements involved in SCA gene regulation but can also lead to the 
      discovery of novel SCA-causing genetic variants. As enhancer variations are being 
      increasingly recognized as a cause of brain disorders, screening the enhancers of 
      ATXN1, ATXN3, TBP and ITPR1 for variations other than CNVs and identifying and 
      screening enhancers of other SCA genes might elucidate the genetic cause in 
      undiagnosed patients.

      disease.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is caused by the 
      expansion of a genetically unstable polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat in ATXN3. 
      Longer alleles are generally associated with earlier onset and frequent 
      intergenerational expansions mediate the anticipation observed in this disorder. 
      Somatic expansion of the repeat has also been implicated in disease onset and 
      slowing the rate of somatic expansion has been proposed as a therapeutic 
      strategy. Here, we utilised high-throughput ultra-deep MiSeq amplicon sequencing 
      to precisely define the number and sequence of the ATXN3 repeat, the genotype of 
      an adjacent single nucleotide variant and quantify somatic expansion in blood and 
      buccal swab DNA of a cohort of individuals with SCA3 from the Azores islands 
      (Portugal). We revealed systematic mis-sizing of the ATXN3 repeat and high levels 
      of inaccuracy of the traditional fragment length analysis that have important 
      implications for attempts to identify modifiers of clinical and molecular 
      phenotypes. Quantification of somatic expansion in blood DNA and multivariate 
      regression revealed the expected effects of age at sampling and CAG repeat 
      length, although the effect of repeat length was surprisingly modest with much 
      stronger associations with age. We also observed an association of the downstream 
      rs12895357 single nucleotide variant with the rate of somatic expansion, and a 
      higher level of somatic expansion in buccal swab DNA compared to blood. These 
      data suggest that the ATXN3 locus in SCA3 patients in blood or buccal swab DNA 
      might serve as a good biomarker for clinical trials testing suppressors of 
      somatic expansion with peripheral exposure.

TI  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia in Brazil: A Comprehensive Genotype - Phenotype Analysis.
PG  - 2414-2425
LID - 10.1007/s12311-024-01745-3 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a diverse group of hereditary 
      neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of the 
      cerebellum and other parts of the nervous system. In this study, we examined the 
      genotype...phenotype correlations in SCAs within the Brazilian population by 
      leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 763 individuals from SARAH Network of 
      Rehabilitation Hospitals. Using a retrospective, cross-sectional, observational, 
      multicentric approach, we analysed medical records and conducted standardized 
      molecular testing to explore epidemiological characteristics, clinical 
      manifestations, and genetic profiles of SCAs in Brazil. Our findings revealed the 
      predominance of SCA3, followed by SCA7 and SCA2, which aligns with global trends 
      and reflects the specific genetic landscape of Brazil. A significant inverse 
      relationship between the age of symptom onset and CAG repeat length in the 
      mutated allele was observed across SCAs 2, 3, and 7. This study also highlights a 
      trend towards paternal inheritance in SCA2 and details the distribution of CAG 
      repeat expansions, which correlates larger expansions with earlier onset and 
      specific symptomatology. This extensive analysis underscores the critical 
      importance of genetic testing in the diagnosis and management of SCAs and 
      enlightens the intricate genotype...phenotype interplay within a genetically 
      diverse population. Despite certain limitations, such as potential selection bias 
      and the retrospective nature of the study, our research provides invaluable 
      insights into the prevalence, genetic underpinnings, and clinical variability of 
      SCAs in Brazil. We suggest a broader demographic scope and investigations into 
      nonmotor symptoms in future studies to obtain a more comprehensive understanding 
      of SCAs.

COIS- Declarations. Human Ethics and Consent to Participate: Not applicable. 
      Considering that this retrospective study was conducted only from data collected 
      from medical records and anonymized, which included individuals followed up in 
      units of the SARAH Network of Rehabilitation Hospitals located outside the state 
      of Rio de Janeiro, obtaining consent to participate in the Declaration was 
      waived. In addition, many patients had already died or interrupted the clinical 
      follow-up, and the COVID-19 pandemic transformed many consultations into 
      teleconsultations, which made it difficult to obtain consent to comply with the 
      Declaration of Helsinki if desired. Competing Interests: The authors declare no

      neurodegenerative symptoms in Huntington's disease.

LID - e2406308121
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) are the two 
      most prevalent polyglutamine (polyQ) neurodegenerative diseases, caused by CAG 
      (encoding glutamine) repeat expansion in the coding region of the huntingtin 
      (HTT) and ataxin-3 (ATXN3) proteins, respectively. We have earlier reported that 
      the activity, but not the protein level, of an essential DNA repair enzyme, 
      polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP), is severely abrogated in both HD and 
      SCA3 resulting in accumulation of double-strand breaks in patients' brain genome. 
      While investigating the mechanistic basis for the loss of PNKP activity and 
      accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks leading to neuronal death, we observed 
      that PNKP interacts with the nuclear isoform of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase 
      fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3). Depletion of PFKFB3 markedly abrogates 
      PNKP activity without changing its protein level. Notably, the levels of both 
      PFKFB3 and its product fructose-2,6 bisphosphate (F2,6BP), an allosteric 
      modulator of glycolysis, are significantly lower in the nuclear extracts of 
      postmortem brain tissues of HD and SCA3 patients. Supplementation of F2,6BP 
      restored PNKP activity in the nuclear extracts of patients' brain. Moreover, 
      intracellular delivery of F2,6BP restored both the activity of PNKP and the 
      integrity of transcribed genome in neuronal cells derived from the striatum of 
      the HD mouse. Importantly, supplementing F2,6BP rescued the HD phenotype in 
      Drosophila, suggesting F2,6BP to serve in vivo as a cofactor for the proper 
      functionality of PNKP and thereby, of brain health. Our results thus provide a 
      compelling rationale for exploring the therapeutic use of F2,6BP and structurally 
      related compounds for treating polyQ diseases.

AB  - RNA repeat expansions fold into stable structures and cause microsatellite 
      diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD), myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), and 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). The trinucleotide expansion of r(CAG), or 
      r(CAG)(exp), causes both HD and SCA3, and the RNA's toxicity has been traced to 
      its translation into polyglutamine (polyQ; HD) as well as aberrant pre-mRNA 
      alternative splicing (SCA3 and HD). Previously, a small molecule, 1, was 
      discovered that binds to r(CAG)(exp) and rescues aberrant pre-mRNA splicing in 
      patient-derived fibroblasts by freeing proteins bound to the repeats. Here, we 
      report the structures of single r(CAG) repeat motif (5'CAG/3'GAC where the 
      underlined adenosines form a 1x1 nucleotide internal loop) in complex with 1 and 
      two other small molecules via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy 
      combined with simulated annealing. Compound 2 was designed based on the structure 
      of 1 bound to the RNA while 3 was selected as a diverse chemical scaffold. The 
      three complexes, although adopting different 3D binding pockets upon ligand 
      binding, are stabilized by a combination of stacking interactions with the 
      internal loop's closing GC base pairs, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals 
      interactions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed with NMR-derived 
      restraints show that the RNA is stretched and bent upon ligand binding with 
      significant changes in propeller-twist and opening. Compound 3 has a distinct 
      mode of binding by insertion into the helix, displacing one of the loop 
      nucleotides into the major groove and affording a rod-like shape binding pocket. 
      In contrast, 1 and 2 are groove binders. A series of single molecule magnetic 
      force spectroscopy studies provide a mechanistic explanation for how bioactive 
      compounds might rescue disease-associated cellular phenotypes.

      Repeat Expansion.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is a 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by the ATXN3 CAG repeat expansion. 
      Preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT-M) of SCA3/MJD 
      should include reliable repeat expansion detection coupled with high-risk allele 
      determination using informative linked markers. One couple underwent SCA3/MJD 
      PGT-M combining ATXN3 (CAG)(n) triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) with customized 
      linkage-based risk allele genotyping on whole-genome-amplified trophectoderm 
      cells. Microsatellites closely linked to ATXN3 were identified and 16 markers 
      were genotyped on 187 anonymous DNAs to verify their polymorphic information 
      content. In the SCA3/MJD PGT-M case, the ATXN3 (CAG)(n) TP-PCR and linked marker 
      analysis results concurred completely. Among the three unaffected embryos, a 
      single embryo was transferred and successfully resulted in an unaffected live 
      birth. A total of 139 microsatellites within 1 Mb upstream and downstream of the 
      ATXN3 CAG repeat were identified and 8 polymorphic markers from each side were 
      successfully co-amplified in a single-tube reaction. A PGT-M assay involving 
      ATXN3 (CAG)(n) TP-PCR and linkage-based risk allele identification has been 
      developed for SCA3/MJD. A hexadecaplex panel of highly polymorphic 
      microsatellites tightly linked to ATXN3 has been developed for the rapid 
      identification of informative markers in at-risk couples for use in the PGT-M of 
      SCA3/MJD.

AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      spinocerebellar ataxia caused by a polyglutamine-coding CAG repeat expansion in 
      the ATXN3 gene. While the CAG length correlates negatively with the age at onset, 
      it accounts for approximately 50% of its variability only. Despite larger efforts 
      in identifying contributing genetic factors, candidate genes with a robust and 
      plausible impact on the molecular pathogenesis of MJD are scarce. Therefore, we 
      analysed missense single nucleotide polymorphism variants in the PRKN gene 
      encoding the Parkinson's disease-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin, which is 
      a well-described interaction partner of the MJD protein ataxin-3, a 
      deubiquitinase. By performing a correlation analysis in the to-date largest MJD 
      cohort of more than 900 individuals, we identified the V380L variant as a 
      relevant factor, decreasing the age at onset by 3 years in homozygous carriers. 
      Functional analysis in an MJD cell model demonstrated that parkin V380L did not 
      modulate soluble or aggregate levels of ataxin-3 but reduced the interaction of 
      the two proteins. Moreover, the presence of parkin V380L interfered with the 
      execution of mitophagy-the autophagic removal of surplus or damaged 
      mitochondria-thereby compromising cell viability. In summary, we identified the 
      V380L variant in parkin as a genetic modifier of MJD, with negative repercussions 
      on its molecular pathogenesis and disease age at onset.

TI  - Spinocerebellar Ataxias: Phenotypic Spectrum of PolyQ versus Non-Repeat Expansion 
      Forms.
PG  - 2258-2268
LID - 10.1007/s12311-024-01723-9 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are most frequently due to (CAG)(n) (coding for 
      polyglutamine, polyQ) expansions and, less so, to expansion of other 
      oligonucleotide repeats (non-polyQ) or other type of variants (non-repeat 
      expansion SCA). In this study we compared polyQ and non-repeat expansion SCA, in 
      a cohort of patients with hereditary ataxia followed at a tertiary hospital. From 
      a prospective study, 88 patients (51 families) with SCA were selected, 74 (40 
      families) of whom genetically diagnosed. Thirty-eight patients (51.4%, 19 
      families) were confirmed as having a polyQ (no other repeat-expansions were 
      identified) and 36 (48.6%, 21 families) a non-repeat expansion SCA. Median 
      age-at-onset was 39.5 [30.0-45.5] for polyQ and 7.0 years [1.00-21.50] for 
      non-repeat expansion SCA. PolyQ SCA were associated with cerebellar onset, and 
      non-repeat expansion forms with non-cerebellar onset. Time to diagnosis was 
      longer for non-repeat expansion SCA. The most common polyQ SCA were 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD/SCA3) (73.7%) and SCA2 (15.8%); whereas in non-repeat 
      expansion SCA ATX-CACNA1A (14.3%), ATP1A3-related ataxia, ATX-ITPR1, 
      ATX/HSP-KCNA2, and ATX-PRKCG (9.5% each) predominated. Disease duration (up to 
      inclusion) was significantly higher in non-repeat expansion SCA, but the 
      difference in SARA score was not statistically significant. Cerebellar peduncles 
      and pons atrophy were more common in polyQ ataxias, as was axonal neuropathy. SCA 
      had a wide range of genetic etiology, age-at-onset and presentation. Proportion 
      of polyQ and non-repeat expansion SCA was similar; the latter had a higher 
      genetic heterogeneity. While polyQ ataxias were typically linked to cerebellar 
      onset in adulthood, non-repeat expansion forms associated with early onset and 
      non-cerebellar presentations.

AB  - There is an obvious clinical-pathological overlap between essential tremor and 
      some known tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansion disorders. The aim is 
      to analyse whether these short tandem repeat genes, including ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, TBP, BEAN1, NOP56, DAB1, ATN1, 
      SADM12 and FMR1, are associated with familial essential tremor patients. Genetic 
      analysis of repeat sizes in tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansions was 
      performed in a large cohort of 515 familial essential tremor probands and 300 
      controls. The demographic and clinical features among carriers of pathogenic 
      expansions, intermediate repeats and non-carriers were compared. A total of 18 
      out of 515 (18/515, 3.7%) patients were found to have repeats expansions, 
      including 12 cases (12/515, 2.5%) with intermediate repeat expansions (one ATXN1, 
      eight TBP, two FMR1, one ATN1), and six cases (6/515, 1.2%) with pathogenic 
      expansions (one ATXN1, one ATXN2, one ATXN8OS, one PPP2R2B, one FMR1, one 
      SAMD12). There were no statistically significant differences in intermediate 
      repeats compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, there were no significant 
      differences in demographics and clinical features among individuals with 
      pathogenic expansions, intermediate repeat expansions carriers and non-carriers. 
      Our study indicates that the intermediate repeat expansion in tremor-associated 
      short tandem repeat expansions does not pose an increased risk for essential 
      tremor, and rare pathogenic expansion carriers have been found in the familial 
      essential tremor cohort. The diagnosis of essential tremor based solely on 
      clinical symptoms remains a challenge in distinguishing it from known short 
      tandem repeat expansions diseases with overlapping clinical-pathological 
      features.

AB  - Aggregation of aberrant proteins is a common pathological hallmark in 
      neurodegeneration such as polyglutamine (polyQ) and other repeat-expansion 
      diseases. Here through overexpression of ataxin3 C-terminal polyQ expansion in 
      Drosophila gut enterocytes, we generated an intestinal obstruction model of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type3 (SCA3) and reported a new role of nuclear-associated 
      endosomes (NAEs)-the delivery of polyQ to the nucleoplasm. In this model, 
      accompanied by the prominently increased RAB5-positive NAEs are abundant 
      nucleoplasmic reticulum enriched with polyQ, abnormal nuclear envelope 
      invagination, significantly reduced endoplasmic reticulum, indicating 
      dysfunctional nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and impaired endomembrane 
      organization. Consistently, Rab5 but not Rab7 RNAi further decreased 
      polyQ-related NAEs, inhibited endomembrane disorganization, and alleviated 
      disease model. Interestingly, autophagic proteins were enriched in polyQ-related 
      NAEs and played non-canonical autophagic roles as genetic manipulation of 
      autophagic molecules exhibited differential impacts on NAEs and SCA3 toxicity. 
      Namely, the down-regulation of Atg1 or Atg12 mitigated while Atg5 RNAi aggravated 
      the disease phenotypes both in Drosophila intestines and compound eyes. Our 
      findings, therefore, provide new mechanistic insights and underscore the 
      fundamental roles of endosome-centered nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and 
      homeostatic endomembrane allocation in the pathogenesis of polyQ diseases.

AB  - Expanded CAG repeats in coding regions of different genes are the most common 
      cause of dominantly inherited spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). These repeats are 
      unstable through the germline, and larger repeats lead to earlier onset. We 
      measured somatic expansion in blood samples collected from 30 SCA1, 50 SCA2, 74 
      SCA3, and 30 SCA7 individuals over a mean interval of 8.5 years, along with 
      postmortem tissues and fetal tissues from SCA1, SCA3, and SCA7 individuals to 
      examine somatic expansion at different stages of life. We showed that somatic 
      mosaicism in the blood increases over time. Expansion levels are significantly 
      different among SCAs and correlate with CAG repeat lengths. The level of 
      expansion is greater in individuals with SCA7 who manifest disease compared to 
      that of those who do not yet display symptoms. Brain tissues from SCA individuals 
      have larger expansions compared to the blood. The cerebellum has the lowest 
      mosaicism among the studied brain regions, along with a high expression of ATXNs 
      and DNA repair genes. This was the opposite in cortices, with the highest 
      mosaicism and lower expression of ATXNs and DNA repair genes. Fetal cortices did 
      not show repeat instability. This study shows that CAG repeats are increasingly 
      unstable during life in the blood and the brain of SCA individuals, with gene- 
      and tissue-specific patterns.

TI  - The genetic landscape and phenotypic spectrum of GAA-FGF14 ataxia in China: a

AB  - BACKGROUND: An intronic GAA repeat expansion in FGF14 was recently identified as 
      a cause of GAA-FGF14 ataxia. We aimed to characterise the frequency and 
      phenotypic profile of GAA-FGF14 ataxia in a large Chinese ataxia cohort. METHODS: 
      A total of 1216 patients that included 399 typical late-onset cerebellar ataxia 
      (LOCA), 290 early-onset cerebellar ataxia (EOCA), and 527 multiple system atrophy 
      with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-c) were enrolled. Long-range and 
      repeat-primed PCR were performed to screen for GAA expansions in FGF14. Targeted 
      long-read and whole-genome sequencing were performed to determine repeat size and 
      sequence configuration. A multi-modal study including clinical assessment, MRI, 
      and neurofilament light chain was conducted for disease assessment. FINDINGS: 17 
      GAA-FGF14 positive patients with a (GAA)(>/=250) expansion (12 patients with a 
      GAA-pure expansion, five patients with a (GAA)(>/=250)-[(GAA)(n) (GCA)(m)](z) 
      expansion) and two possible patients with biallelic (GAA)(202/222) alleles were 
      identified. The clinical phenotypes of the 19 positive and possible positive 
      cases covered LOCA phenotype, EOCA phenotype and MSA-c phenotype. Five of six 
      patients with EOCA phenotype were found to have another genetic disorder. The NfL 
      levels of patients with EOCA and MSA-c phenotypes were significantly higher than 
      patients with LOCA phenotype and age-matched controls (p < 0.001). NfL levels of 
      pre-ataxic GAA-FGF14 positive individuals were lower than pre-ataxic SCA3 
      (p < 0.001) and similar to controls. INTERPRETATION: The frequency of GAA-FGF14 
      expansion in a large Chinese LOCA cohort was low (1.3%). Biallelic (GAA)(202/222) 
      alleles and co-occurrence with other acquired or hereditary diseases may 
      contribute to phenotypic variation and different progression. FUNDING: This study 
      was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (2021YFA0805200 to H.J.), the

AB  - Expansions of glutamine-coding CAG trinucleotide repeats cause a number of 
      neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease and several of 
      spinocerebellar ataxias. In general, age-at-onset of the polyglutamine diseases 
      is inversely correlated with the size of the respective inherited expanded CAG 
      repeat. Expanded CAG repeats are also somatically unstable in certain tissues, 
      and age-at-onset of Huntington's disease corrected for individual HTT CAG repeat 
      length (i.e. residual age-at-onset), is modified by repeat instability-related 
      DNA maintenance/repair genes as demonstrated by recent genome-wide association 
      studies. Modification of one polyglutamine disease (e.g. Huntington's disease) by 
      the repeat length of another (e.g. ATXN3, CAG expansions in which cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 3) has also been hypothesized. Consequently, we determined 
      whether age-at-onset in Huntington's disease is modified by the CAG repeats of 
      other polyglutamine disease genes. We found that the CAG measured repeat sizes of 
      other polyglutamine disease genes that were polymorphic in Huntington's disease 
      participants but did not influence Huntington's disease age-at-onset. Additional 
      analysis focusing specifically on ATXN3 in a larger sample set (n = 1388) 
      confirmed the lack of association between Huntington's disease residual 
      age-at-onset and ATXN3 CAG repeat length. Additionally, neither our Huntington's 
      disease onset modifier genome-wide association studies single nucleotide 
      polymorphism data nor imputed short tandem repeat data supported the involvement 
      of other polyglutamine disease genes in modifying Huntington's disease. By 
      contrast, our genome-wide association studies based on imputed short tandem 
      repeats revealed significant modification signals for other genomic regions. 
      Together, our short tandem repeat genome-wide association studies show that 
      modification of Huntington's disease is associated with short tandem repeats that 
      do not involve other polyglutamine disease-causing genes, refining the landscape 
      of Huntington's disease modification and highlighting the importance of rigorous 
      data analysis, especially in genetic studies testing candidate modifiers.

LID - 15
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, is a 
      fatal neurodegenerative disease that causes loss of balance and motor 
      co-ordination, eventually leading to paralysis. It is caused by the autosomal 
      dominant inheritance of a long CAG trinucleotide repeat sequence within the ATXN3 
      gene, encoding for an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat sequence within the 
      ataxin-3 protein. Ataxin-3 containing an expanded polyQ repeat is known to be 
      highly prone to intraneuronal aggregation, and previous studies have demonstrated 
      that protein quality control pathways, such as autophagy, are impaired in MJD 
      patients and animal models of the disease. In this study, we tested the 
      therapeutic potential of spermidine on zebrafish and rodent models of MJD to 
      determine its capacity to induce autophagy and improve functional output. 
      Spermidine treatment of transgenic MJD zebrafish induced autophagy and resulted 
      in increased distances swum by the MJD zebrafish. Interestingly, treatment of the 
      CMVMJD135 mouse model of MJD with spermidine added to drinking water did not 
      produce any improvement in motor behaviour assays, neurological testing or 
      neuropathology. In fact, wild type mice treated with spermidine were found to 
      have decreased rotarod performance when compared to control animals. Immunoblot 
      analysis of protein lysates extracted from mouse cerebellar tissue found little 
      differences between the groups, except for an increased level of phospho-ULK1 in 
      spermidine treated animals, suggesting that autophagy was indeed induced. As we 
      detected decreased motor performance in wild type mice following treatment with 
      spermidine, we conducted follow up studies into the effects of spermidine 
      treatment in zebrafish. Interestingly, we found that in addition to inducing 
      autophagy, spermidine treatment also induced apoptosis, particularly in wild type 
      zebrafish. These findings suggest that spermidine treatment may not be 
      therapeutically beneficial for the treatment of MJD, and in fact warrants caution 
      due to the potential negative side effects caused by induction of apoptosis.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most common dominantly inherited 
      ataxia. Currently, no preventive or disease-modifying treatments exist for this 
      progressive neurodegenerative disorder, although efforts using gene silencing 
      approaches are under clinical trial investigation. The disease is caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the mutant gene, ATXN3, producing an enlarged polyglutamine 
      tract in the mutant protein. Similar to other paradigmatic neurodegenerative 
      diseases, studies evaluating the pathogenic mechanism focus primarily on neuronal 
      implications. Consequently, therapeutic interventions often overlook non-neuronal 
      contributions to disease. Our lab recently reported that oligodendrocytes display 
      some of the earliest and most progressive dysfunction in SCA3 mice. Evidence of 
      disease-associated oligodendrocyte signatures has also been reported in other 
      neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Here, we assess the 
      effects of anti-ATXN3 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) treatment on 
      oligodendrocyte dysfunction in premanifest and symptomatic SCA3 mice. We report a 
      severe, but modifiable, deficit in oligodendrocyte maturation caused by the toxic 
      gain-of-function of mutant ATXN3 early in SCA3 disease that is transcriptionally, 
      biochemically, and functionally rescued with anti-ATXN3 ASO. Our results 
      highlight the promising use of an ASO therapy across neurodegenerative diseases 
      that requires glial targeting in addition to affected neuronal populations.

AB  - Brain region-specific degeneration and somatic expansions of the mutant 
      Huntingtin (mHTT) CAG tract are key features of Huntington's disease (HD). 
      However, the relationships among CAG expansions, death of specific cell types and 
      molecular events associated with these processes are not established. Here, we 
      used fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting (FANS) and deep molecular profiling 
      to gain insight into the properties of cell types of the human striatum and 
      cerebellum in HD and control donors. CAG expansions arise at mHTT in striatal 
      medium spiny neurons (MSNs), cholinergic interneurons and cerebellar Purkinje 
      neurons, and at mutant ATXN3 in MSNs from SCA3 donors. CAG expansions in MSNs are 
      associated with higher levels of MSH2 and MSH3 (forming MutSbeta), which can inhibit 
      nucleolytic excision of CAG slip-outs by FAN1. Our data support a model in which 
      CAG expansions are necessary but may not be sufficient for cell death and 
      identify transcriptional changes associated with somatic CAG expansions and 
      striatal toxicity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) is a neurological disease characterized by 
      action tremor in upper arms. Although its high heritability and prevalence 
      worldwide, its etiology and association with other diseases are still unknown. 
      METHOD: We investigated 10 common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), including SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, SCA36, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA) in 92 early-onset familial ET pedigrees in China collected from 
      2016 to 2022. RESULT: We found one SCA12 proband carried 51 CAG repeats within 
      PPP2R2B gene and one SCA3 proband with intermediate CAG repeats (55) with ATXN3 
      gene. The other 90 ET probands all had normal repeat expansions. CONCLUSION: 
      Tremor can be the initial phenotype of certain SCA. For early-onset, familial ET 
      patients, careful physical examinations are needed before genetic SCA screening.

TI  - The Cerebellar Cognitive Affective/Schmahmann Syndrome Scale in Spinocerebellar

AB  - The Cerebellar Cognitive Affective/Schmahmann Syndrome (CCAS) manifests as 
      impaired executive control, linguistic processing, visual spatial function, and 
      affect regulation. The CCAS has been described in the spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs), but its prevalence is unknown. We analyzed results of the CCAS/Schmahmann 
      Scale (CCAS-S), developed to detect and quantify CCAS, in two natural history 
      studies of 309 individuals Symptomatic for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, or SCA8, 
      26 individuals Pre-symptomatic for SCA1 or SCA3, and 37 Controls. We compared 
      total raw scores, domain scores, and total fail scores between Symptomatic, 
      Pre-symptomatic, and Control cohorts, and between SCA types. We calculated scale 
      sensitivity and selectivity based on CCAS category designation among Symptomatic 
      individuals and Controls, and correlated CCAS-S performance against age and 
      education, and in Symptomatic patients, against genetic repeat length, onset age, 
      disease duration, motor ataxia, depression, and fatigue. Definite CCAS was 
      identified in 46% of the Symptomatic group. False positive rate among Controls 
      was 5.4%. Symptomatic individuals had poorer global CCAS-S performance than 
      Controls, accounting for age and education. The domains of semantic fluency, 
      phonemic fluency, and category switching that tap executive function and 
      linguistic processing consistently separated Symptomatic individuals from 
      Controls. CCAS-S scores correlated most closely with motor ataxia. Controls were 
      similar to Pre-symptomatic individuals whose nearness to symptom onset was 
      unknown. The use of the CCAS-S identifies a high CCAS prevalence in a large 
      cohort of SCA patients, underscoring the utility of the scale and the notion that 
      the CCAS is the third cornerstone of clinical ataxiology.

AB  - Neurologists have a difficult time identifying sporadic cerebellar ataxia. 
      Multiple system atrophy of the cerebellar type (MSA-C), spontaneous late cortical 
      cerebellar atrophy, and prolonged alcohol use are a few possible causes. In a 
      group of people with sporadic cerebellar ataxia that was not MSA-C, an 
      autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) mutation was recently discovered. 
      Chinese single-hospital cohort will be used in this study to genetic screen for 
      SCA-related genes. One hundred forty individuals with CA were monitored over 8 
      years. Thirty-one individuals had familial CA, 109 patients had sporadic CA, 73 
      had MSA-C, and 36 had non-MSA-C sporadic CA. In 28 of the 31 non-MSA-C sporadic 
      patients who requested the test, we carried out gene analysis, including SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, SCA31, and 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The control group consisted of 
      family members of the patients. In 57% of the instances with spontaneous CA that 
      were not MSA-C, gene abnormalities were discovered. The most frequent exception 
      among individuals with sporadic CA was SCA6 (36%), followed by monsters in SCA1, 
      2, 3, 8, and DRPLA. In contrast, 75% of the patients with familial CA had gene 
      abnormalities, the most frequent of which was SCA6 abnormality. The age of 69 vs 
      59 was higher, and the CAG repeat length was a minor age of 23 vs 25 in the 
      former instances compared to the last one among individuals with SCA6 anomalies 
      that were sporadic as opposed to familial cases. In sporadic CA, 
      autosomal-dominant mutations in SCA genes, notably in SCA6, are common. Although 
      the cause of the increased incidence of SCA6 mutations is unknown, it may be 
      related to a greater age of onset and varied penetrance of SCA6 mutations.

TI  - Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate restores DNA repair activity of PNKP and ameliorates 
      neurodegenerative symptoms in Huntington's disease.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) are the two 
      most prevalent polyglutamine (polyQ) neurodegenerative diseases, caused by CAG 
      (encoding glutamine) repeat expansion in the coding region of the huntingtin 
      (HTT) and ataxin-3 (ATXN3) proteins, respectively. We have earlier reported that 
      the activity, but not the protein level, of an essential DNA repair enzyme, 
      polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP), is severely abrogated in both HD and 
      SCA3 resulting in accumulation of double-strand breaks in patients' brain genome. 
      While investigating the mechanistic basis for the loss of PNKP activity and 
      accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks leading to neuronal death, we observed 
      that PNKP interacts with the nuclear isoform of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase 
      fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3). Depletion of PFKFB3 markedly abrogates 
      PNKP activity without changing its protein level. Notably, the levels of both 
      PFKFB3 and its product fructose-2,6 bisphosphate (F2,6BP), an allosteric 
      modulator of glycolysis, are significantly lower in the nuclear extracts of 
      post-mortem brain tissues of HD and SCA3 patients. Supplementation of F2,6BP 
      restored PNKP activity in the nuclear extracts of patients' brain. Moreover, 
      intracellular delivery of F2,6BP restored both the activity of PNKP and the 
      integrity of transcribed genome in neuronal cells derived from striatum of HD 
      mouse. Importantly, supplementing F2,6BP rescued the HD phenotype in Drosophila, 
      suggesting F2,6BP to serve in vivo as a cofactor for the proper functionality of 
      PNKP and thereby, of brain health. Our results thus provide a compelling 
      rationale for exploring the therapeutic use of F2,6BP and structurally related 
      compounds for treating polyQ diseases.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a genetic degeneration disease of the 
      nervous system with ataxia as the main clinical manifestation, and the most 
      frequent subtype of SCA3 is known to be caused by CAG repeat expansions of more 
      than 55 units in ATXN3. In this study, we used peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
      (PBMCs) from a volunteer with 14/63 CAG repeats in ATXN3 to generate induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which will be a good model for studying SCA3.

TI  - Prevalence of repeat expansions causing autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      ataxias in Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan.
PG  - 27-31

AB  - In Japan, approximately 30% of spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) is hereditary, 
      and more than 90% of hereditary SCD is autosomal dominant SCD (AD-SCD). We have 
      previously reported the types of AD-SCD in Hokkaido, twice. In this study, we 
      investigated the status of AD-SCD mainly due to repeat expansions, covering the 
      period since the last report. We performed genetic analysis for 312 patients with 
      a clinical diagnosis of SCD, except for multiple system atrophy at medical 
      institutions in Hokkaido between January 2007 and December 2020. The median age 
      at the time of analysis was 58 (1-86) years. Pathogenic variants causing AD-SCD 
      due to repeat expansion were found in 61.5% (192 cases). Spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) 6 was the most common type in 25.3% (79 cases), followed by Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD)/SCA3 in 13.8% (43), SCA1 in 6.4% (20), SCA2 in 5.1% (16), SCA31 in 
      4.8% (15), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy in 4.8% (15), SCA7 in 0.6% (2), 
      and SCA8 in 0.6% (2). SCA17, 27B, 36, and 37 were not found. Compared to previous 
      reports, this study found a higher prevalence of SCA6 and a lower prevalence of 
      MJD/SCA3. An increasing number of cases identified by genetic testing, including 
      cases with no apparent family history, accurately revealed the distribution of 
      disease types in Hokkaido.

TI  - PolyQ-Expansion Causes Mitochondria Fragmentation Independent of Huntingtin and 
      Is Distinct from Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)/Mechanical Stress-Mediated 
      Fragmentation Which Results from Cell Death.
LID - 10.3390/cells12192406 [doi]
LID - 2406
AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction has been reported in many Huntington's disease (HD) 
      models; however, it is unclear how these defects occur. Here, we test the 
      hypothesis that excess pathogenic huntingtin (HTT) impairs mitochondrial 
      homeostasis, using Drosophila genetics and pharmacological inhibitors in HD and 
      polyQ-expansion disease models and in a mechanical stress-induced traumatic brain 
      injury (TBI) model. Expression of pathogenic HTT caused fragmented mitochondria 
      compared to normal HTT, but HTT did not co-localize with mitochondria under 
      normal or pathogenic conditions. Expression of pathogenic polyQ (127Q) alone or 
      in the context of Machado Joseph Disease (MJD) caused fragmented mitochondria. 
      While mitochondrial fragmentation was not dependent on the cellular location of 
      polyQ accumulations, the expression of a chaperone protein, excess of mitofusin 
      (MFN), or depletion of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) rescued fragmentation. 
      Intriguingly, a higher concentration of nitric oxide (NO) was observed in 
      polyQ-expressing larval brains and inhibiting NO production rescued 
      polyQ-mediated fragmented mitochondria, postulating that DRP1 nitrosylation could 
      contribute to excess fission. Furthermore, while excess PI3K, which suppresses 
      polyQ-induced cell death, did not rescue polyQ-mediated fragmentation, it did 
      rescue fragmentation caused by mechanical stress/TBI. Together, our observations 
      suggest that pathogenic polyQ alone is sufficient to cause DRP1-dependent 
      mitochondrial fragmentation upstream of cell death, uncovering distinct 
      physiological mechanisms for mitochondrial dysfunction in polyQ disease and 
      mechanical stress.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction has been described in many neurodegenerative disorders; 
      however, there is less information regarding mitochondrial deficits in 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), a polyglutamine (polyQ) disorder caused by CAG 
      repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. In the present study, we characterized the 
      changes in mitochondrial function and biogenesis markers in two MJD models, 
      CMVMJD135 (MJD135) transgenic mice at a fully established phenotype stage and 
      tetracycline-regulated PC6-3 Q108 cell line expressing mutant ataxin-3 (mATXN3). 
      We detected mATXN3 in the mitochondrial fractions of PC6-3 Q108 cells, suggesting 
      the interaction of expanded ATXN3 with the organelle. Interestingly, in both the 
      cerebella of the MJD135 mouse model and in PC6-3 Q108 cells, we found decreased 
      mitochondrial respiration, ATP production and mitochondrial membrane potential, 
      strongly suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction in MJD. Also, in PC6-3 Q108 cells, 
      an additional enhanced glycolytic flux was observed. Supporting the functional 
      deficits observed in MJD mitochondria, MJD135 mouse cerebellum and PC6-3 Q108 
      cells showed reduced cytochrome c mRNA and protein levels. Overall, our findings 
      show compromised mitochondrial function associated with decreased cytochrome c 
      levels in both cell and animal models of MJD.

TI  - Incident Kaposi sarcoma during the expansion of antiretroviral therapy 
      eligibility in Nigeria: a retrospective cohort study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) eligibility could 
      lead to earlier initiation of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) treatment and 
      consequently reduce the risk of HIV-associated Kaposi Sarcoma (KS). We 
      investigated the impact of changes in the Nigerian HIV treatment guidelines on KS 
      incidence among adults enrolled in HIV care in Nigeria. METHODS: We analyzed data 
      of adults who enrolled for HIV care from January 2006 to December 2016 at one of 
      Nigeria's largest HIV treatment centers. Based on changes in HIV treatment 
      guidelines, we classified 2006-2009 as the pre-expansion period and 2010-2016 as 
      the post-expansion period. We used Kaplan Meier curves to compare the incidence 
      of KS in the pre-expansion to the post-expansion period. We used Cox regression 
      models to assess the hazard for incident KS between the two periods after 
      adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 14,479 patients with HIV, the 
      overall KS incidence was 2.35; 95% CI 2.01-2.74/1,000 person-years. The incidence 
      of KS decreased from 2.53 to 1.58 per 1,000 person-years from 2006 to 2009 to 
      2010-2016. In models adjusting for age, sex, CD4-T cell count, and ART use, the 
      risk for KS remained lower in 2010-2016 compared to 2006-2009. In analyses 
      restricted to time on ART, there was no significant difference in KS incidence 
      between HIV patients who enrolled in 2006-2009 and 2010-2016 after adjusting for 
      age, sex, and CD4 T-cell count. CONCLUSION: The expansion of ART eligibility was 
      associated with a reduced incidence of HIV-associated KS among adults initiating 
      HIV care in Jos, Nigeria. The reduction was likely driven by earlier enrollment 
      for HIV care and ART initiation.

AB  - There are more than 40 types of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), most of which are 
      caused by abnormal expansion of short tandem repeats at various gene loci. These 
      phenotypically similar disorders require molecular testing at multiple loci by 
      fluorescent PCR and capillary electrophoresis to identify the causative repeat 
      expansion. We describe a simple strategy to screen for the more common SCA1, 
      SCA2, and SCA3 by rapidly detecting the abnormal CAG repeat expansion at the 
      ATXN1, ATXN2, and ATXN3 loci using melting curve analysis of triplet-primed PCR 
      products. Each of the three separate assays employs a plasmid DNA carrying a 
      known repeat size to generate a threshold melt peak temperature, which 
      effectively distinguishes expansion-positive samples from those without a repeat 
      expansion. Samples that are screened positive based on their melt peak profiles 
      are subjected to capillary electrophoresis for repeat sizing and genotype 
      confirmation. These screening assays are robust and provide accurate detection of 
      the repeat expansion while eliminating the need for fluorescent PCR and capillary 
      electrophoresis for every sample.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To perform a screening for Huntington disease (HD) phenocopies in a 
      Swedish cohort. METHODS: Seventy-three DNA samples negative for HD were assessed 
      at a tertiary center in Stockholm. The screening included analyses for 
      C9orf72-frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9orf72-FTD/ALS), 
      octapeptide repeat insertions (OPRIs) in PRNP associated with inherited prion 
      diseases (IPD), Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2), spinocerebellar ataxia-2 
      (SCA2), spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) and spinocerebellar ataxia-17 (SCA17). 
      Targeted genetic analysis was carried out in two cases based on the salient 
      phenotypic features. RESULTS: The screening identified two patients with SCA17, 
      one patient with IPD associated with 5-OPRI but none with nucleotide expansions 
      in C9orf72 or for HDL2, SCA2 or SCA3. Furthermore, SGCE-myoclonic-dystonia 11 
      (SGCE-M-D) and benign hereditary chorea (BHC) was diagnosed in two sporadic 
      cases. WES identified VUS in STUB1 in two patients with predominant cerebellar 
      ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in keeping with previous screenings and 
      suggest that other genes yet to be discovered are involved in the etiology of HD 
      phenocopies.

AB  - Brain region-specific degeneration and somatic expansions of the mutant 
      Huntingtin (mHTT) CAG tract are key features of Huntington's disease (HD). 
      However, the relationships between CAG expansions, death of specific cell types, 
      and molecular events associated with these processes are not established. Here we 
      employed fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting (FANS) and deep molecular 
      profiling to gain insight into the properties of cell types of the human striatum 
      and cerebellum in HD and control donors. CAG expansions arise in striatal medium 
      spiny neurons (MSNs) and cholinergic interneurons, in cerebellar Purkinje 
      neurons, and at mATXN3 in MSNs from SCA3 donors. CAG expansions in MSNs are 
      associated with higher levels of MSH2 and MSH3 (forming MutSbeta), which can inhibit 
      nucleolytic excision of CAG slip-outs by FAN1 in a concentration-dependent 
      manner. Our data indicate that ongoing CAG expansions are not sufficient for cell

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a common autosomal dominant 
      hereditary ataxia, which is caused by a cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat 
      expansion on the causative gene ATXN3, usually with lower extremity ataxia as the 
      first symptom, and effective treatment is scarce. Repetitive transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive technique that regulates the 
      cerebellum and the neural network connected to it. METHODS: Herein, we report 
      familial cases of SCA3 in two nephews and their aunt, each of whom was treated 
      with high-frequency (5 Hz) rTMS. The rTMS treatment lasted 2 weeks, once daily 
      for 5 consecutive days a week, about 20 minutes each session. The Scale for the 
      Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), the International Cooperative Ataxia 
      Rating Scale (ICARS), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) 
      examination were evaluated before and after rTMS treatment. RESULTS: We found 
      that the ICARS scores improved significantly (p = 0.04), and the NAA/Cr values 
      were elevated in vermis and both cerebellar hemispheres after rTMS treatment. 
      CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that high-frequency rTMS therapy can contribute 
      to the improvement of cerebellar NAA/Cr value of SCA3 patients, and improve 
      posture and gait as well as limb kinetic function in SCA3 patients.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph disease, is 
      the most common dominantly inherited ataxia. SCA3 is caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the ATXN3 gene that encodes an expanded tract of polyglutamine in 
      the disease protein ataxin-3 (ATXN3). As a deubiquitinating enzyme, ATXN3 
      regulates numerous cellular processes including proteasome- and 
      autophagy-mediated protein degradation. In SCA3 disease brain, polyQ-expanded 
      ATXN3 accumulates with other cellular constituents, including ubiquitin 
      (Ub)-modified proteins, in select areas like the cerebellum and the brainstem, 
      but whether pathogenic ATXN3 affects the abundance of ubiquitinated species is 
      unknown. Here, in mouse and cellular models of SCA3, we investigated whether 
      elimination of murine Atxn3 or expression of wild-type or polyQ-expanded human 
      ATXN3 alters soluble levels of overall ubiquitination, as well as K48-linked 
      (K48-Ub) and K63-linked (K63-Ub) chains. Levels of ubiquitination were assessed 
      in the cerebellum and brainstem of 7- and 47-week-old Atxn3 knockout and SCA3 
      transgenic mice, and also in relevant mouse and human cell lines. In older mice, 
      we observed that wild-type ATXN3 impacts the cerebellar levels of K48-Ub 
      proteins. In contrast, pathogenic ATXN3 leads to decreased brainstem abundance of 
      K48-Ub species in younger mice and changes in both cerebellar and brainstem 
      K63-Ub levels in an age-dependent manner: younger SCA3 mice have higher levels of 
      K63-Ub while older mice have lower levels of K63-Ub compared to controls. Human 
      SCA3 neuronal progenitor cells also show a relative increase in K63-Ub proteins 
      upon autophagy inhibition. We conclude that wild-type and mutant ATXN3 
      differentially impact K48-Ub- and K63-Ub-modified proteins in the brain in a 
      region- and age-dependent manner.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Plasma neurofilament light (NfL), glial fibrillary 
      acidic protein (GFAP), phosphorylated-tau (p-tau), and beta-amyloid (Abeta) have 
      emerged as promising markers in several neurodegenerative disorders, but whether 
      they can be used as biomarkers in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) is yet to be 
      determined. This study aimed to identify sensitive plasma markers for SCA and 
      investigate their effectiveness in tracking ataxia severity, cognition, non-motor 
      symptoms, and brain atrophy. METHODS: This observational study recruited 
      consecutive participants from Huashan Hospital and the CABLE study from November 
      2019. Patients with SCA were genetically diagnosed, grouped according to the 
      ataxia severity, and compared with healthy older individuals and patients with 
      multiple system atrophy type C (MSA-C). Plasma NfL, GFAP, p-tau, and Abeta levels 
      were measured by Simoa in all participants. Analysis of covariance, Spearman 
      correlation, and multivariable regression were used to explore candidate markers 
      in SCA. RESULTS: A total of 190 participants (60 SCA, 56 MSA-C, and 74 healthy 
      controls) were enrolled. Plasma NfL level increased early in the pre-ataxic stage 
      of SCA (32.23 +/- 3.07 vs. 11.41 +/- 6.62 pg/mL in controls), was positively 
      associated with the ataxia severity (r = 0.45, P = 0.005) and CAG repeat length 
      (r = 0.51, P = 0.001), varied among the different SCA subtypes 
      (39.57 +/- 13.50 pg/mL in SCA3, which was higher than 28.17 +/- 8.02 pg/mL in SCA2, 
      17.08 +/- 6.78 pg/mL in SCA8, and 24.44 +/- 18.97 pg/mL in rare SCAs; P < 0.05), and 
      was associated with brainstem atrophy. NfL alone (area under the curve [AUC] 
      0.867) or combined with p-tau181 and Abeta (AUC 0.929), showed excellent performance 
      in discriminating SCA patients from controls. Plasma GFAP distinguished SCA from 
      MSA-C with moderate accuracy (AUC > 0.700) and correlated with cognitive 
      performance and cortical atrophy. Changes in levels of p-tau181 and Abeta were 
      observed in SCA patients compared to controls. They were both correlated with 
      cognition, while Abeta was also associated with non-motor symptoms, such as anxiety 
      and depression. DISCUSSION: Plasma NfL may serve as a sensitive biomarker for 
      SCA, and its level is elevated in the pre-ataxic stage. The different performance 
      of NfL and GFAP indicates differences in the underlying neuropathology of SCA and 
      MSA-C. Moreover, amyloid markers may be useful for detecting memory dysfunction 
      and other non-motor symptoms in SCA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging studies suggest that whole genome sequencing provides 
      additional diagnostic yield of genomic variants when compared with chromosomal 
      microarray analysis in the etiologic diagnosis of infants and children with 
      suspected genetic diseases. However, the application and evaluation of whole 
      genome sequencing in prenatal diagnosis remain limited. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      aimed to evaluate the accuracy, efficacy, and incremental yield of whole genome 
      sequencing in comparison with chromosomal microarray analysis for routine 
      prenatal diagnosis. STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective study, a total of 185 
      unselected singleton fetuses with ultrasound-detected structural anomalies were 
      enrolled. In parallel, each sample was subjected to whole genome sequencing and 
      chromosomal microarray analysis. Aneuploidies and copy number variations were 
      detected and analyzed in a blinded fashion. Single nucleotide variations and 
      insertions and deletions were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and trinucleotide 
      repeats expansion variants were verified using polymerase chain reaction plus 
      fragment-length analysis. RESULTS: Overall, genetic diagnoses using whole genome 
      sequencing were obtained for 28 (15.1%) cases. Whole genome sequencing not only 
      detected all these aneuploidies and copy number variations in the 20 (10.8%) 
      diagnosed cases identified by chromosomal microarray analysis, but also detected 
      1 case with an exonic deletion of COL4A2 and 7 (3.8%) cases with single 
      nucleotide variations or insertions and deletions. In addition, 3 incidental 
      findings were detected including an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat in 
      ATXN3, a splice-sites variant in ATRX, and an ANXA11 missense mutation in a case 
      of trisomy 21. CONCLUSION: Compared with chromosomal microarray analysis, whole 
      genome sequencing increased the additional detection rate by 5.9% (11/185). Using 
      whole genome sequencing, we detected not only aneuploidies and copy number 
      variations, but also single nucleotide variations and insertions and deletions, 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions, and exonic copy number variations with high 
      accuracy in an acceptable turnaround time (3-4 weeks). Our results suggest that 
      whole genome sequencing has the potential to be a new promising prenatal 
      diagnostic test for fetal structural anomalies.

TI  - Regional and age-dependent changes in ubiquitination in cellular and mouse models 
      of Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machadoaeuro"Joseph disease, is 
      the most common dominantly inherited ataxia. SCA3 is caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the ATXN3 gene that encodes an expanded tract of polyglutamine 
      (polyQ) in the disease protein ataxin-3 (ATXN3). As a deubiquitinating enzyme, 
      ATXN3 regulates numerous cellular processes including proteasome- and 
      autophagy-mediated protein degradation. In SCA3 disease brain, polyQ-expanded 
      ATXN3 accumulates with other cellular constituents, including ubiquitin 
      (Ub)-modified proteins, in select areas like the cerebellum and the brainstem, 
      but whether pathogenic ATXN3 affects the abundance of ubiquitinated species is 
      unknown. Here, in mouse and cellular models of SCA3, we investigated whether 
      elimination of murine Atxn3 or expression of wild-type or polyQ-expanded human 
      ATXN3 alters soluble levels of overall ubiquitination, as well as K48-linked 
      (K48-Ub) and K63-linked (K63-Ub) chains. Levels of ubiquitination were assessed 
      in the cerebellum and brainstem of 7- and 47-week-old Atxn3 knockout and SCA3 
      transgenic mice, and also in relevant mouse and human cell lines. In older mice, 
      we observed that wild-type ATXN3 impacts the cerebellar levels of K48-Ub 
      proteins. In contrast, pathogenic ATXN3 leads to decreased brainstem abundance of 
      K48-Ub species in younger mice and changes in both cerebellar and brainstem 
      K63-Ub levels in an age-dependent manner: younger SCA3 mice have higher levels of 
      K63-Ub while older mice have lower levels of K63-Ub compared to controls. Human 
      SCA3 neuronal progenitor cells also show a relative increase in K63-Ub proteins 
      upon autophagy inhibition. We conclude that wild-type and mutant ATXN3 
      differentially impact K48-Ub- and K63-Ub-modified proteins in the brain in a 
      region- and age-dependent manner.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. Though the ATXN3 protein is expressed 
      ubiquitously throughout the CNS, regional pathology in SCA3 patients is observed 
      within select neuronal populations and more recently within oligodendrocyte-rich 
      white matter tracts. We have previously recapitulated these white matter 
      abnormalities in an overexpression mouse model of SCA3 and demonstrated that 
      oligodendrocyte maturation impairments are one of the earliest and most 
      progressive changes in SCA3 pathogenesis. Disease-associated oligodendrocyte 
      signatures have recently emerged as significant contributors to several other 
      neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, 
      and Parkinson's disease, but their role in regional vulnerability and disease 
      progression remains unexplored. Here, we are the first to comparatively assess 
      myelination in human tissue in a region-dependent manner. Translating these 
      findings to SCA3 mouse models of disease, we confirmed endogenous expression of 
      mutant Atxn3 leads to regional transcriptional dysregulation of oligodendrocyte 
      maturation markers in Knock-In models of SCA3. We then investigated the 
      spatiotemporal progression of mature oligodendrocyte transcriptional 
      dysregulation in an overexpression SCA3 mouse model and how it relates to the 
      onset of motor impairment. We further determined that regional reduction in 
      mature oligodendrocyte cell counts in SCA3 mice over time parallels the onset and 
      progression of brain atrophy in SCA3 patients. This work emphasizes the 
      prospective contributions of disease-associated oligodendrocyte signatures to 
      regional vulnerability and could inform timepoints and target regions imperative 
      for biomarker assessment and therapeutic intervention in several 
      neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3) is a member of the family of polyglutamine 
      (polyQ) diseases that are caused by anomalous CAG triplet repeat expansions in 
      several genes. SCA3 results from abnormal polyQ expansion in the deubiquitinase 
      (DUB), ataxin-3 (Atxn3). To understand the role of the different domains of 
      mutant Atxn3 on its pathogenicity, with the hope that they can be explored for 
      therapeutic interventions, we have systematically studied their individual and 
      collective effects on its toxicity. One such domain is ubiquitin-binding site 1 
      (UbS1) on the catalytic domain of Atxn3; UbS1 is necessary for the enzymatic 
      activity of Atxn3. Here, we investigated the importance of UbS1 on the toxicity 
      of pathogenic Atxn3. We generated transgenic Drosophila melanogaster lines that 
      express polyQ-expanded Atxn3 with and without a functional UbS1. We found that 
      mutating UbS1 markedly exacerbates the toxicity of pathogenic Atxn3. Additional 
      studies indicated that UbS1 regulates the toxicity of Atxn3 not by affecting its 
      aggregation or sub-cellular localization, but by impacting its role in ubiquitin 
      processing. Our findings provide additional insights into the role of Atxn3's 
      domains in the pathogenicity of SCA3.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxias (CAs) represent a group of autosomal dominant and recessive 
      neurodegenerative disorders affecting cerebellum with or without spinal cord. 
      Overall, CAs have preponderance for tandem nucleotide repeat expansions as an 
      etiological factor (10 TREs explain nearly 30-40% of ataxia cohort globally). The 
      experience of 10 years of common genetic ataxia subtypes for  approximately 5600 patients' 
      referrals (Pan-India) received at a single center is shared herein. Frequencies 
      (in %, n) of SCA types and FRDA in the sample cohort are observed as follows: 
      SCA12 (8.6%, 490); SCA2 (8.5%, 482); SCA1 (4.8%, 272); SCA3 (2%, 113); SCA7 
      (0.5%, 28); SCA6 (0.1%, 05); SCA17 (0.1%, 05), and FRDA (2.2%, 127). A 
      significant amount of variability in TRE lengths at each locus is observed, we 
      noted presence of biallelic expansion, co-occurrence of SCA-subtypes, and the 
      presence of premutable normal alleles. The frequency of mutated GAA-FRDA allele 
      in healthy controls is 1/158 (0.63%), thus an expected FRDA prevalence of 1:100 
      000 persons. The data of this study are relevant not only for clinical decision 
      making but also for guidance in direction of genetic investigations, 
      transancestral comparison of genotypes, and lastly provide insight for policy 
      decision for the consideration of SCAs under rare disease category.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic efficacy of clinical 
      exome-targeted sequencing (CES) and spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36) screening 
      in a real-life cohort of patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) from Eastern Spain. 
      METHODS: A total of 130 unrelated patients with CA, negative for common 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, 
      SCA17, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA], and Friedreich ataxia), were 
      studied with CES. Bioinformatic and genotype-phenotype analyses were performed to 
      assess the pathogenicity of the variants encountered. Copy number variants were 
      analyzed when appropriate. In undiagnosed dominant and sporadic cases, repeat 
      primed PCR was used to screen for the presence of a repeat expansion in the NOP56 
      gene. RESULTS: CES identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 50 
      families (39%), including 23 novel variants. Overall, there was a high genetic 
      heterogeneity, and the most frequent genetic diagnosis was SPG7 (n = 15), 
      followed by SETX (n = 6), CACNA1A (n = 5), POLR3A (n = 4), and SYNE1 (n = 3). In 
      addition, 17 families displayed likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants in 14 
      different genes: KCND3 (n = 2), KIF1C (n = 2), CYP27A1A (n = 2), AFG3L2 (n = 1), 
      ANO10 (n = 1), CAPN1 (n = 1), CWF19L1 (n = 1), ITPR1 (n = 1), KCNA1 (n = 1), OPA1 
      (n = 1), PNPLA6 (n = 1), SPG11 (n = 1), SPTBN2 (n = 1), and TPP1 (n = 1). 
      Twenty-two novel variants were characterized. SCA36 was diagnosed in 11 families, 
      all with autosomal dominant (AD) presentation. SCA36 screening increased the 
      total diagnostic rate to 47% (n = 61/130). Ultimately, undiagnosed patients 
      showed delayed age at onset (p < 0.05) and were more frequently sporadic. 
      DISCUSSION: Our study provides insight into the genetic landscape of CA in 
      Eastern Spain. Although CES was an effective approach to capture genetic 
      heterogeneity, most patients remained undiagnosed. SCA36 was found to be a 
      relatively frequent form and, therefore, should be tested prior to CES in 
      familial AD presentations in particular geographical regions.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressively fatal neurodegenerative 
      disease affecting motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. In this study, we 
      investigated gene expression changes in ALS via RNA sequencing in 380 postmortem 
      samples from cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord segments from 154 
      individuals with ALS and 49 control individuals. We observed an increase in 
      microglia and astrocyte gene expression, accompanied by a decrease in 
      oligodendrocyte gene expression. By creating a gene co-expression network in the 
      ALS samples, we identified several activated microglia modules that negatively 
      correlate with retrospective disease duration. We mapped molecular quantitative 
      trait loci and found several potential ALS risk loci that may act through gene 
      expression or splicing in the spinal cord and assign putative cell types for 
      FNBP1, ACSL5, SH3RF1 and NFASC. Finally, we outline how common genetic variants 
      associated with splicing of C9orf72 act as proxies for the well-known repeat 
      expansion, and we use the same mechanism to suggest ATXN3 as a putative risk 
      gene.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by progressive motor and nonmotor deficits concomitant with 
      degenerative pathophysiological changes within the cerebellum. The cerebellum is 
      topographically organized into cerebello-cerebral circuits that create distinct 
      functional networks regulating movement, cognition, and affect. SCA3-associated 
      motor and nonmotor symptoms are possibly related not only to intracerebellar 
      changes but also to disruption of the connectivity within these 
      cerebello-cerebral circuits. However, to date, no comprehensive investigation of 
      cerebello-cerebral connectivity in SCA3 has been conducted. The present study 
      aimed to identify cerebello-cerebral functional connectivity alterations and 
      associations with downstream clinical phenotypes and upstream topographic markers 
      of cerebellar neurodegeneration in patients with SCA3. This study included 45 
      patients with SCA3 and 49 healthy controls. Voxel-based morphometry and 
      resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed to 
      characterize the cerebellar atrophy and to examine the cerebello-cerebral 
      functional connectivity patterns. Structural MRI confirmed widespread gray matter 
      atrophy in the motor and cognitive cerebellum of patients with SCA3. We found 
      reduced functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortical 
      networks, including the somatomotor, frontoparietal, and default networks; 
      however, increased connectivity was observed between the cerebellum and the 
      dorsal attention network. These abnormal patterns correlated with the CAG repeat 
      expansion and deficits in global cognition. Our results indicate the contribution 
      of cerebello-cerebral networks to the motor and cognitive impairments in patients 
      with SCA3 and reveal that such alterations occur in association with cerebellar 
      atrophy. These findings add important insights into our understanding of the role 
      of the cerebellum in SCA3.

TI  - The S-Factor, a New Measure of Disease Severity in Spinocerebellar Ataxia: 
      Findings and Implications.
PG  - 790-809
LID - 10.1007/s12311-022-01424-1 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are progressive neurodegenerative disorders, but 
      there is no metric that predicts disease severity over time. We hypothesized that 
      by developing a new metric, the Severity Factor (S-Factor) using immutable 
      disease parameters, it would be possible to capture disease severity independent 
      of clinical rating scales. Extracting data from the CRC-SCA and READISCA natural 
      history studies, we calculated the S-Factor for 438 participants with symptomatic 
      SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6, as follows: ((length of CAG repeat expansion - maximum 
      normal repeat length) /maximum normal repeat length) x (current age - age at 
      disease onset) x 10). Within each SCA type, the S-Factor at the first Scale for 
      the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) visit (baseline) was correlated 
      against scores on SARA and other motor and cognitive assessments. In 281 
      participants with longitudinal data, the slope of the S-Factor over time was 
      correlated against slopes of scores on SARA and other motor rating scales. At 
      baseline, the S-Factor showed moderate-to-strong correlations with SARA and other 
      motor rating scales at the group level, but not with cognitive performance. 
      Longitudinally the S-Factor slope showed no consistent association with the slope 
      of performance on motor scales. Approximately 30% of SARA slopes reflected a 
      trend of non-progression in motor symptoms. The S-Factor is an 
      observer-independent metric of disease burden in SCAs. It may be useful at the 
      group level to compare cohorts at baseline in clinical studies. Derivation and 
      examination of the S-factor highlighted challenges in the use of clinical rating 
      scales in this population.

AB  - The most common autosomal dominant ataxia worldwide, spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3 (SCA3) is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. Here we report the generation 
      of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line UM134-1, the first SCA3 disease-specific 
      hESC line to be added to the NIH hESC registry. UM134-1 pluripotency was 
      confirmed by immunocytochemistry and PCR for pluripotency markers and by the 
      ability to form three germ layers in vitro. The established hESC line provides a 
      useful new human cell model to study the pathogenesis of SCA3.

AB  - Defects in ataxin-3 proteins and CAG repeat expansions in its coding gene ATXN3 
      cause Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3) or Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) 
      polyglutamine neurodegenerative disease. The mutant proteins aggregate as 
      inclusion bodies in cells and compete with wild-type ataxin-3, which leads to 
      neuronal dysfunction or death and impairs Beclin1-mediated autophagy. It has been 
      reported that Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can reliably treat several 
      neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we used a Transcription Factor EB (TFEB) 
      nuclear translocation-mediated MSCs co-culture approach to reconstitute autophagy 
      and lysosomal biogenesis, and reduce SCA3-like behaviors in induced pluripotent 
      stem cells (iPSCs)-derived neuron cells models. Our iPSCs model showed enhanced 
      expression of autophagy proteins, attenuated the expression and toxic effects of 
      mutant ataxin-3 on neurons, and alleviated the effects of ataxin-3 on autophagy. 
      Therefore, MSCs are associated with autophagy-inducing therapy and compared to 
      animal models, our MSCs co-culture could be used as a novel and potential 
      therapeutic approach to study SCA3 disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 (SCA3) is an adult-onset autosomal 
      dominant neurodegenerative disease. It is caused by expanding of CAG repeat in 
      ATXN3 gene that later on would affect brain structures. This brain changes could 
      be evaluated using brain MRI volumetric. However, findings across published brain 
      volumetric studies have been inconsistent. Here, we report MRI brain volumetric 
      analysis in a family of SCA 3 patients, which included pre-symptomatic and 
      symptomatic patients. METHODOLOGY: The study included affected and unaffected 
      members from a large six-generation family of SCA 3, genetically confirmed using 
      PolyQ/CAG repeat expansion analysis, Sanger sequencing, and PCR. Clinical 
      evaluation was performed using Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia 
      (SARA). Subjects' brains were scanned using 3.0-T MRI with a 3D T1 BRAVO 
      sequence. Evaluations were performed by 2 independent neuroradiologists. An 
      automated volumetric analysis was performed using FreeSurfer and CERES (for the 
      cerebellum). RESULT: We evaluated 7 subjects from this SCA3 family, including 3 
      subjects with SCA3 and 4 unaffected subjects. The volumetric evaluation revealed 
      smaller brain volumes (p < 0.05) in the corpus callosum, cerebellar volume of 
      lobules I-II, lobule IV, lobule VIIB and lobule IX; and in cerebellar gray matter 
      volume of lobule IV, and VIIIA; in the pathologic/expanded CAG repeat group 
      (SCA3). CONCLUSION: Brain MRI volumetry of SCA3 subjects showed smaller brain 
      volumes in multiple brain regions including the corpus callosum and gray matter 
      volumes of several cerebellar lobules.

TI  - Hypothalamic Atrophy, Expanded CAG Repeat, and Low Body Mass Index in 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3.
PG  - 1541-1546

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is an inherited motor disorder 
      that is characterized by low body mass index (BMI). Considering the role of the 
      hypothalamus in regulating appetitive behaviors and metabolism, low BMI may 
      result from hypothalamic degeneration. OBJECTIVES: To examine hypothalamic volume 
      changes in SCA3 by comparing patients and matched healthy controls and to 
      identify potential mediating effects of hypothalamic pathology on CAG repeats for 
      BMI. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging datasets of hypothalamic volumes from 41 
      SCA3 patients and 49 matched controls were analyzed. Relationships among CAG 
      repeat number, hypothalamic volumes, and BMI were assessed using correlation and 
      mediation analyses. RESULTS: SCA3 patients exhibited significant hypothalamic 
      atrophy. Tubular hypothalamic volume was significantly associated with BMI. 
      Mediation analysis revealed an indirect effect of CAG repeat number on BMI via 
      tubular hypothalamic atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Low BMI in SCA3 is related to 
      neurodegeneration within the tubular hypothalamus, providing a potential target 
      for energy-based treatment. (c) 2022 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder

AB  - Spinal cerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph disease, is 
      the result of abnormal repeat amplification of CAG of the ATXN3 gene. It is one 
      of the main types of autosomal dominant ataxia, with motor symptoms of cerebellar 
      ataxia, mainly accompanied by non-motor symptoms, such as ocular symptoms, 
      psychiatric symptoms, and nutritional disorders. Currently, no effective 
      treatment is available for patients with SCA3. The construction of induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from two SCA3 patients (14/74 CAG repeats) will be 
      an excellent tool for studying SCA3 disease mechanisms and for drug screening.

AB  - RNA toxicity contributes to diseases caused by anomalous nucleotide repeat 
      expansions. Recent work demonstrated RNA-based toxicity from repeat-associated, 
      non-AUG-initiated translation (RAN translation). RAN translation occurs around 
      long nucleotide repeats that form hairpin loops, allowing for translation 
      initiation in the absence of a start codon that results in potentially toxic, 
      poly-amino acid repeat-containing proteins. Discovered in Spinocerebellar Ataxia 
      Type (SCA) 8, RAN translation has been documented in several repeat-expansion 
      diseases, including in the CAG repeat-dependent polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders. 
      The ATXN3 gene, which causes SCA3, also known as Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD), 
      contains a CAG repeat that is expanded in disease. ATXN3 mRNA possesses features 
      linked to RAN translation. In this paper, we examined the potential contribution 
      of RAN translation to SCA3/MJD in Drosophila by using isogenic lines that contain 
      homomeric or interrupted CAG repeats. We did not observe unconventional 
      translation in fly neurons or glia. However, our investigations indicate 
      differential toxicity from ATXN3 protein-encoding mRNA that contains pure versus 
      interrupted CAG repeats. Additional work suggests that this difference may be due 
      in part to toxicity from homomeric CAG mRNA. We conclude that Drosophila is not 
      suitable to model RAN translation for SCA3/MJD, but offers clues into the 
      potential pathogenesis stemming from CAG repeat-containing mRNA in this disorder.

LID - 10.1002/acn3.51515 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the evolution of disability in spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCAs) type 1, 2, 3, and 6 (SCA1, 2, 3, 6). METHODS: We analyzed data of 
      two longitudinal cohorts (RISCA, EUROSCA) which recruited ataxic and non-ataxic 
      SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6 mutation carriers. To study disability, we used a 
      five-stage system for ataxia defined by walking ability (stages 0-3) and death 
      (stage 4). Transitions were analyzed using a multi-state model with proportional 
      transition hazards. Based on the hazard estimates, transition probabilities and 
      the expected lengths of stay in each stage were calculated. We further studied 
      the effect of sex and CAG repeat length on progression. RESULTS: Data of 3138 
      visits in 677 participants were analyzed. Median SARA scores for SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, and SCA6 ranged from 1.5 (interquartile range [IQR] = 0.0-3.5) to 3.5 
      (IQR = 1.4-6.1) in stage 0, 11.5 (IQR = 9.6-14.0) to 13.8 (IQR = 11.0-16.0) in 
      stage 1, 19.0 (IQR = 17.0-21.0) to 23.8 (IQR = 19.5-27.0) in stage 2, and 28.5 
      (IQR = 26.0-32.5) to 34.0 (IQR = 32.6-37.1) in stage 3. Modeling allowed to 
      calculate the subtype-specific probability to be in a certain stage at a given 
      age and duration of each stage. CAG repeat length was associated with faster 
      progression in SCA1 (HR, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.1-1.2), SCA2 (1.2, 1.1-1.3), and SCA3 
      (1.1, 1.0-1.2). In SCA6, female sex was associated with faster progression (1.7, 
      1.1-2.6). INTERPRETATION: Our data are important for counselling of patients, 
      assessment of the relevance of outcome markers, and design of clinical trials.

      disorders in the UK: a retrospective diagnostic accuracy and prospective clinical

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansion disorders affect about 1 in 3000 individuals and are 
      clinically heterogeneous diseases caused by expansions of short tandem DNA 
      repeats. Genetic testing is often locus-specific, resulting in underdiagnosis of 
      people who have atypical clinical presentations, especially in paediatric 
      patients without a previous positive family history. Whole genome sequencing is 
      increasingly used as a first-line test for other rare genetic disorders, and we 
      aimed to assess its performance in the diagnosis of patients with neurological 
      repeat expansion disorders. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic 
      accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect the most common repeat expansion 
      loci associated with neurological outcomes (AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, 
      C9orf72, CACNA1A, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, and TBP) using samples obtained within 
      the National Health Service in England from patients who were suspected of having 
      neurological disorders; previous PCR test results were used as the reference 
      standard. The clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat 
      expansions was prospectively examined in previously genetically tested and 
      undiagnosed patients recruited in 2013-17 to the 100 000 Genomes Project in the 
      UK, who were suspected of having a genetic neurological disorder (familial or 
      early-onset forms of ataxia, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, dementia, motor 
      neuron disease, parkinsonian movement disorders, intellectual disability, or 
      neuromuscular disorders). If a repeat expansion call was made using whole genome 
      sequencing, PCR was used to confirm the result. FINDINGS: The diagnostic accuracy 
      of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat expansions was evaluated against 793 
      PCR tests previously performed within the NHS from 404 patients. Whole genome 
      sequencing correctly classified 215 of 221 expanded alleles and 1316 of 1321 
      non-expanded alleles, showing 97.3% sensitivity (95% CI 94.2-99.0) and 99.6% 
      specificity (99.1-99.9) across the 13 disease-associated loci when compared with 
      PCR test results. In samples from 11 631 patients in the 100 000 Genomes Project, 
      whole genome sequencing identified 81 repeat expansions, which were also tested 
      by PCR: 68 were confirmed as repeat expansions in the full pathogenic range, 11 
      were non-pathogenic intermediate expansions or premutations, and two were 
      non-expanded repeats (16% false discovery rate). INTERPRETATION: In our study, 
      whole genome sequencing for the detection of repeat expansions showed high 
      sensitivity and specificity, and it led to identification of neurological repeat 
      expansion disorders in previously undiagnosed patients. These findings support 
      implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical laboratories for diagnosis 
      of patients who have a neurological presentation consistent with a repeat 
      expansion disorder. FUNDING: Medical Research Council, Department of Health and

TI  - Genetic Distribution of Five Spinocerebellar Ataxia Microsatellite Loci in 
      Mexican Native American Populations and Its Impact on Contemporary Mestizo 
      Populations.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) conform a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders with autosomal dominant inheritance. Five of the most frequent SCAs are 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the exons of specific genes. The SCAs 
      incidence and the distribution of polymorphic CAG alleles vary among populations 
      and ethnicities. Thus, characterization of the genetic architecture of ethnically 
      diverse populations, which have undergone recent admixture and demographic 
      events, could facilitate the identification of genetic risk factors. Owing to the 
      great ethnic diversity of the Mexican population, this study aimed to analyze the 
      allele frequencies of five SCA microsatellite loci (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and 
      SCA7) in eleven Mexican Native American (MNA) populations. Data from the 
      literature were used to compare the allelic distribution of SCA loci with 
      worldwide populations. The SCA loci allelic frequencies evidenced a certain 
      genetic homogeneity in the MNA populations, except for Mayans, who exhibited 
      distinctive genetic profiles. Neither pathological nor large normal alleles were 
      found in MNA populations, except for the SCA2 pre-mutated allele in the Zapotec 
      population. Collectively, our findings demonstrated the contribution of the MNA 
      ancestry in shaping the genetic structure of contemporary Mexican Mestizo 
      populations. Our results also suggest that Native American ancestry has no impact 
      on the origin of SCAs in the Mexican population. Instead, the acquisition of 
      pathological SCA alleles could be associated with European migration.

TI  - Impaired Oligodendrocyte Maturation Is an Early Feature in SCA3 Disease 
      Pathogenesis.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia Type 3 (SCA3), the most common dominantly inherited 
      ataxia, is a polyglutamine neurodegenerative disease for which there is no 
      disease-modifying therapy. The polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the 
      ATXN3 gene results in expression of a mutant form of the ATXN3 protein, a 
      deubiquitinase that causes selective neurodegeneration despite being widely 
      expressed. The mechanisms driving neurodegeneration in SCA3 are unclear. Research 
      to date, however, has focused almost exclusively on neurons. Here, using equal 
      male and female age-matched transgenic mice expressing full-length human mutant 
      ATXN3, we identified early and robust transcriptional changes in selectively 
      vulnerable brain regions that implicate oligodendrocytes in disease pathogenesis. 
      We mapped transcriptional changes across early, mid, and late stages of disease 
      in two selectively vulnerable brain regions: the cerebellum and brainstem. The 
      most significant disease-associated module through weighted gene coexpression 
      network analysis revealed dysfunction in SCA3 oligodendrocyte maturation. These 
      results reflect a toxic gain-of-function mechanism, as ATXN3 KO mice do not 
      exhibit any impairments in oligodendrocyte maturation. Genetic crosses to 
      reporter mice revealed a marked reduction in mature oligodendrocytes in 
      SCA3-disease vulnerable brain regions, and ultrastructural microscopy confirmed 
      abnormalities in axonal myelination. Further study of isolated oligodendrocyte 
      precursor cells from SCA3 mice established that this impairment in 
      oligodendrocyte maturation is a cell-autonomous process. We conclude that SCA3 is 
      not simply a disease of neurons, and the search for therapeutic strategies and 
      disease biomarkers will need to account for non-neuronal involvement in SCA3 
      pathogenesis.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Despite advances in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      Type 3 (SCA3) disease understanding, much remains unknown about how the disease 
      gene causes brain dysfunction ultimately leading to cell death. We completed a 
      longitudinal transcriptomic analysis of vulnerable brain regions in SCA3 mice to 
      define the earliest and most robust changes across disease progression. Through 
      gene network analyses followed up with biochemical and histologic studies in SCA3 
      mice, we provide evidence for severe dysfunction in oligodendrocyte maturation 
      early in SCA3 pathogenesis. Our results advance understanding of SCA3 disease 
      mechanisms, identify additional routes for therapeutic intervention, and may 
      provide broader insight into polyglutamine diseases beyond SCA3.

TI  - Brain structural abnormalities in the preclinical stage of Machado-Joseph 
      disease/spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (MJD/SCA3): evaluation by MRI morphometry, 
      diffusion tensor imaging and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging.
PG  - 2989-2998

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether neurite orientation dispersion and density 
      imaging (NODDI) could provide the added value for detecting brain microstructural 
      alterations in the preclinical stage of Machado-Joseph disease/spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 3 (MJD/SCA3) compared with MRI morphometry and diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI). METHODS: Twenty preclinical MJD/SCA3 patients and 21 healthy 
      controls were enrolled. Three b values DWI and 3D T1-weighted images were 
      acquired at 3.0 T. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) approach was used to 
      investigate the white matter (WM) alterations in the DTI metrics and NODDI 
      metrics. Gray matter-based spatial statistics (GBSS) approach was used to 
      investigate the grey matter (GM) alterations in the NODDI metrics. Voxel-based 
      morphometry (VBM) approach was performed on the 3D T1-weighted images. The 
      relationship between the cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat length and brain 
      microstructural alterations of preclinical MJD/SCA3 was identified. RESULTS: 
      Compared with healthy controls, the preclinical MJD/SCA3 patients showed 
      decreased FA and NDI as well as increased MD, AD, and RD in the WM of cerebellum 
      and brainstem (corrected P < 0.05), and decreased NDI in the GM of cerebellar 
      vermis (corrected P < 0.05). The CAG repeat length in preclinical MJD/SCA3 
      patients was negatively correlated with the reduced FA and NDI of the 
      infratentorial WM and the reduced NDI of the cerebellum, and positively with the 
      increased MD and RD of the infratentorial WM. CONCLUSIONS: NOODI can provide 
      novel quantitative microstructural changes in MJD/SCA3 carriers, expanding our 
      understanding of the gray and white matter (axons and dendrites) degeneration in 
      this frequent ataxia syndrome.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is the most common autosomal dominant inherited 
      ataxia worldwide, caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the Ataxin-3 gene resulting 
      in a polyglutamine (polyQ)-expansion in the corresponding protein. The disease is 
      characterized by neuropathological, phenotypical, and specific transcriptional 
      changes in affected brain regions. So far, there is no mouse model available 
      representing all the different aspects of the disease, yet highly needed for a 
      better understanding of the disease pathomechanisms. Here, we characterized a 
      novel Ataxin-3 knock-in mouse model, expressing a heterozygous or homozygous 
      expansion of 304 CAACAGs in the murine Ataxin-3 locus using biochemical, 
      behavioral, and transcriptomic approaches. We compared neuropathological, and 
      behavioral features of the new knock-in model with the in SCA3 research mostly 
      used YAC84Q mouse model. Further, we compared transcriptional changes found in 
      cerebellar samples of the SCA3 knock-in mice and post-mortem human SCA3 patients. 
      The novel knock-in mouse is characterized by the expression of a polyQ-expansion 
      in the murine Ataxin-3 protein, leading to aggregate formation, especially in 
      brain regions known to be vulnerable in SCA3 patients, and impairment of Purkinje 
      cells. Along these neuropathological changes, the mice showed a reduction in body 
      weight accompanied by gait and balance instability. Transcriptomic analysis of 
      cerebellar tissue revealed age-dependent differential expression, enriched for 
      genes attributed to myelinating oligodendrocytes. Comparing these changes with 
      those found in cerebellar tissue of SCA3 patients, we discovered an overlap of 
      differentially expressed genes pointing towards similar gene expression 
      perturbances in several genes linked to myelin sheaths and myelinating 
      oligodendrocytes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most common autosomal 
      dominant spinocerebellar ataxia worldwide. Almost all patients with SCA3 exhibit 
      nystagmus and/or saccades impairment. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence of 
      nystagmus as an early neurological manifestation, before ataxia, in some patients 
      with SCA3 in the first six months of the disease. METHODS: We evaluated a series 
      of 155 patients with clinically and molecularly proven SCA3 between 2013 and 
      2020. Data regarding sex, age, age at onset, disease duration, CAG repeat 
      expansion length, first symptom, presence of ataxia, scores on SARA and ICARS 
      scales, and presence and characteristics of nystagmus were collected. RESULTS: We 
      identified seven patients with symptomatic SCA3 who presented with isolated 
      nystagmus. In these seven individuals the age at onset ranged from 24 to 57 
      years, and disease duration from four to six months. CONCLUSIONS: Our study 
      showed that nystagmus may be the first neurological sign in SCA3. This clinical 
      observation reinforces the idea that the neurodegenerative process in SCA3 
      patients may start in vestibular system connections or in flocculonodular lobe. 
      This study adds relevant information about pre-symptomatic features in SCA3 that 
      may work as basis for a better understanding of brain degeneration and for future 
      therapeutic clinical trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is one of the most common 
      autosomal dominant ataxias in the world. Several reports revealed that CAG 
      repeats in some polyQ-containing genes may affect the age at onset (AAO) of 
      patients with SCA2, however, little studies were conducted among Chinese patients 
      with SCA2. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of CAG repeats 
      on the AAO of patients with SCA2 in China. METHODS: A total of 119 patients with 
      SCA2 were enrolled and were divided into 2 groups according to their major 
      phenotype: 17 patients from 9 families with Parkinson's syndrome were grouped as 
      the Parkinson's disease-SCA2 (PD-SAC2); 91 patients from 66 SCA2 families and 11 
      sporadic SCA2 patients were grouped as the ataxia-SCA2 (A-SCA2). Blood samples 
      were obtained from the subjects, and the CAG repeat length in ATXN2 and other 
      (CAG)(n)-containing genes was screened using fluorescent PCR. The Spearman's rank 
      correlation between the CAG repeat length in (CAG)(n)-containing genes and AAO 
      was analyzed. Regression analysis was performed to investigate whether the CAG 
      repeat length could explain the variant of AAO. A t-test was used to compare the 
      difference of CAG repeat length in (CAG)(n)-containing genes between the PD-SAC2 
      and A-SCA2 groups. RESULTS: The CAG repeat length in the longer allele of ATXN2 
      was negatively correlated with AAO of SCA2 (R=-0.251, P<0.05), and the CAG repeat 
      length could explain 41.7% of the variation of AAO. AAO negatively correlated 
      with the CAG repeat length in the shorter allele of ATXN7 (R=-0.251, P=0.006) or 
      in the longer allele of TBP gene (R=-0.197, P=0.034). A tendency of delay in the 
      AAO was also observed in patients with SCA2 carrying the CAG repeat within the 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, and RAI1. In addition, we found that the CAG repeat 
      length in ATXN7 and ATXN2 between the A-SCA2 and the PD-SCA2 groups was 
      significantly different (both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The CAG repeat in ATXN2 is a 
      major genetic factor for the AAO of patients with SCA2 in China. The CAG repeat 
      length in ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, and RAI1 genes might be a potential factor 
      associated with the AAO of SCA2. The CAG repeat in ATXN7 might be a potential 
      factor affecting the Parkinson's syndrome in SCA2.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease) is a 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by inheritance of a CAG repeat expansion within 
      the ATXN3 gene, resulting in polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion within the 
      ataxin-3 protein. In this study, we have identified protein aggregates in both 
      neuronal-like (SHSY5Y) cells and transgenic zebrafish expressing human ataxin-3 
      with expanded polyQ. We have adapted a previously reported flow cytometry 
      methodology named flow cytometric analysis of inclusions and trafficking, 
      allowing rapid quantification of detergent insoluble forms of ataxin-3 fused to a 
      GFP in SHSY5Y cells and cells dissociated from the zebrafish larvae. Flow 
      cytometric analysis revealed an increased number of detergent-insoluble ataxin-3 
      particles per nuclei in cells and in zebrafish expressing polyQ-expanded ataxin-3 
      compared to those expressing wild-type human ataxin-3. Treatment with compounds 
      known to modulate autophagic activity altered the number of detergent-insoluble 
      ataxin-3 particles in cells and zebrafish expressing mutant human ataxin-3. We 
      conclude that flow cytometry can be harnessed to rapidly count ataxin-3 
      aggregates, both in vitro and in vivo, and can be used to compare potential 
      therapies targeting protein aggregates. This article has an associated First

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-ataxic manifestations in autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias 
      are variable and influenced by CAG repeat length and age at onset. This report 
      describes a genetically proven SCA2 kindred with an atypical phenotype resembling 
      SCA3. CASE REPORT: The phenotype of five genetically proven patients with SCA2 in 
      this report differed from the typical phenotype owing to persistence of reflexes 
      late into the course of illness, absence of peripheral neuropathy, and very 
      prominent facial twitches. DISCUSSION: Despite descriptions of typical phenotypes 
      of SCA, significant variations occur, especially within kindreds. Caution should 
      be exercised in clinical diagnoses of SCA, especially with atypical features.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hereditary ataxias demonstrate a high degree of clinical and 
      genetic heterogeneity. Understanding the genetic etiology of hereditary ataxias 
      is crucial for genetic counseling and clinical management. METHODS: The clinical 
      and genetic data of patients with familial or sporadic ataxias who referred to 
      our tertiary medical center were retrospectively analyzed. Probands in this study 
      underwent SCA repeat expansion panel firstly to screen for repeat expansion SCAs; 
      those with negative results had NGS-targeted panels or WES testing to detect 
      conventional mutations. RESULTS: A total of 223 patients were enrolled from 206 
      families. 5 kinds of coexisting SCA repeat expansions were observed (SCA3/SCA17, 
      SCA3/SCA8, SCA2/SCA8, SCA3/SCA12 and SCA8/SCA12) in 12 patients from 8 families, 
      among which SCA2/SCA8, SCA8/SCA12 and SCA3/SCA12 were reported for the first 
      time. The coexistence of expanded SCA3 with SCA17 alleles was the most common in 
      our study. NGS identified pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 12 ataxia 
      causative genes in 13 probands. Spastic paraplegia ataxia was the most common 
      diagnosis. Six novel mutations were detected in five ataxia-related genes. 
      CONCLUSION: Coexistence may not specific to a certain SCA subtype and the 
      frequency might have been underestimated before. SCA repeat expansion panel 
      should be considered in patients with overlapping SCA features. In addition, our 
      study broadened the conventional mutation spectrum in ataxia-related genes. These 
      results facilitate a better understanding of the genetic basis for hereditary 
      ataxias.

      Phenotype.

AB  - Calpain-mediated proteolysis has been proposed to modulate the pathogenesis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), a 
      disorder due to a CAG repeat expansion (CAGexp) at ATXN3. We aimed to investigate 
      if single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at calpain gene CAPN2 and at 
      calpastatin gene CAST modulate the age at onset (AO) and disease progression in 
      SCA3/MJD. A total of 287 SCA3/MJD symptomatic subjects (151 families) were 
      included. AO was analyzed and controlled by the CAG repeat length of expanded 
      allele and family. Candidate polymorphisms were chosen based on the literature 
      and on a priori criteria. The CAG repeat length and SNPs were genotyped according 
      to standard methods. AO of carriers of AA and AG + GG(rs1559085) genotypes in 
      CAST and with the median value of 75 repeats at the expanded allele were 34.23 
      (33.07-35.38) and 36.42 years (34.50-38.34), respectively (p = 0.049, mixed model 
      treating the expanded CAG repeat size as fixed effect and family as random 
      effect). Carriers of haplotype C(rs27852)/G(rs1559085) had mean AO of 37.23 
      (12.76) and 33.42 years (12.20) (p = 0.047, Student's t test). Our data suggest 
      an association between allele G(rs1559085) and haplotype C(rs27852)/G(rs1559085) 
      at CAST and variations in the AO of SCA3/MJD subjects, independent from the 
      effects of the CAGexp and family. The present results support the potential role 
      of calpain cleavage pathway over modulation of SCA3/MJD phenotype.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
      heterozygous CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin 3 gene (ATXN3). However, patients 
      with homozygous SCA3 carrying expanded CAG repeats in both alleles of ATXN3 are 
      extremely rare. Herein, we present a case of a 50-year-old female who had 
      homozygous SCA3 with expansion of 62/62 repeats. Segregation analysis of the 
      patient's family showed both a contraction pattern of CAG repeat length and 
      stable transmission. The present case demonstrated an earlier onset and more 
      severe clinical phenotype than that seen in heterozygous individuals, suggesting 
      that the gene dosage enhances disease severity.

AB  - CAG repeat expansion is the genetic cause of nine incurable polyglutamine (polyQ) 
      diseases with neurodegenerative features. Silencing repeat RNA holds great 
      therapeutic value. Here, we developed a repeat-based RNA-cleaving DNAzyme that 
      catalyzes the destruction of expanded CAG repeat RNA of six polyQ diseases with 
      high potency. DNAzyme preferentially cleaved the expanded allele in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) cells. While cleavage was 
      non-allele-specific for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) cells, treatment of 
      DNAzyme leads to improved cell viability without affecting mitochondrial 
      metabolism or p62-dependent aggresome formation. DNAzyme appears to be stable in 
      mouse brain for at least 1 month, and an intermediate dosage of DNAzyme in a SCA3 
      mouse model leads to a significant reduction of high molecular weight ATXN3 
      proteins. Our data suggest that DNAzyme is an effective RNA silencing molecule 
      for potential treatment of multiple polyQ diseases.

TI  - Molecular spectrum, family screening and genetic counselling of Spinocerebellar

PG  - 370-380
LID - 10.1080/01677063.2021.1940172 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA) is a heterogeneous adult-onset disorder with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance pattern mainly caused by triplet repeat 
      expansions. Clinical diagnosis of SCA is based on phenotypic features followed by 
      confirmation through molecular diagnosis. To identify status of repeat range in 
      Indian SCA cases and provide extended family screening, we enrolled 70 clinical 
      SCA suspects. For molecular diagnosis, multiplex PCR (M-PCR) was used for common 
      Indian SCA subtypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12 and 17. TP-PCR was further used in 
      SCA2, 7 and 10 to identify larger expansions. Eighteen out of 70 SCA suspects 
      (25%) were found to be positive for various SCA subtypes- (5 SCA1 (28%), 6 SAC2 
      (34%), 2 SCA3 (12%), 3 SCA7 (16%) and one each for SCA6 (1%) and SCA17 (1%) 
      subtypes). Genetic counselling and extended family screening were offered to all 
      positive cases and yielded additional nine cases. We have established M-PCR and 
      TP-PCR to detect the CAG repeat expansion in SCA suspects. This method can 
      confirm SCA subtypes in a reliable, rapid and cost-effective way. Genetic 
      characterization of SCA-related genes has great clinical relevance, as it could 
      provide additional information and guidance to clinicians and family members 
      regarding prognosis.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by CAG repeat expansion of the ATXN3 gene encoding ataxin-3 protein and is 
      mainly manifested by motor symptoms such as ataxia and non-motor symptoms such as 
      cognitive dysfunction. In this study, we obtained skin fibroblasts from a SCA3 
      patient and successfully constructed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using 
      the reprogramming plasmids expressing OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, LIN28, and L-MYC. The 
      generated iPSC line had a stable karyotype, expressed pluripotency markers, and 
      could differentiate into all three germ layers in vitro. In addition, the iPSC 
      line may be a useful model for identifying SCA3-related pathological mechanisms.

TI  - New Model for Estimation of the Age at Onset in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3.
PG  - e2885-e2895
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000012068 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop an appropriate parametric 
      survival model to predict patient's age at onset (AAO) for spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 3/Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) populations from mainland China. 
      METHODS: We compared the efficiency and performance of 6 parametric survival 
      analysis methods (exponential, weibull, log-gaussian, gaussian, log-logistic, and 
      logistic) based on cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat length at ATXN3 to 
      predict the probability of AAO in the largest cohort of patients with SCA3/MJD. A 
      set of evaluation criteria, including -2 log-likelihood statistic, Akaike 
      information criterion (AIC), bayesian information criterion (BIC), Nagelkerke 
      R-squared (Nagelkerke R;2), and Cox-Snell residual plot, were used to identify 
      the best model. RESULTS: Among these 6 parametric survival models, the logistic 
      model had the lowest -2 log-likelihood (6,560.12), AIC (6,566.12), and BIC 
      (6,566.14) and the highest value of Nagelkerke R;2 (0.54), with the closest graph 
      to the bisector Cox-Snell residual graph. Therefore, the logistic survival model 
      was the best fit to the studied data. Using the optimal logistic survival model, 
      we indicated the age-specific probability distribution of AAO according to the 
      CAG repeat size and current age. CONCLUSIONS: We first demonstrated that the 
      logistic survival model provided the best fit for AAO prediction in patients with 
      SCA3/MJD from mainland China. This optimal model can be valuable in clinical and 
      research. However, the rigorous clinical testing and practice of other 
      independent cohorts are needed for its clinical application. A unified model 
      across multiethnic cohorts is worth further exploration by identifying regional 
      differences and significant modifiers in AAO determination.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), 
      is a polyglutamine expansion disease arising from a trinucleotide CAG repeat 
      expansion in exon 10 of the gene ATXN3. There are no effective pharmacological 
      treatments for MJD, thus the identification of new pathogenic mechanisms, and the 
      development of novel therapeutics is urgently needed. In this study, we performed 
      a comprehensive, blind drug screen of 3942 compounds (many FDA approved) and 
      identified small molecules that rescued the motor-deficient phenotype in 
      transgenic ATXN3 Caenorhabditis elegans strain. Out of this screen, five lead 
      compounds restoring motility, protecting against neurodegeneration, and 
      increasing the lifespan in ATXN3-CAG89 mutant worms were identified. These 
      compounds were alfacalcidol, chenodiol, cyclophosphamide, fenbufen, and 
      sulfaphenazole. We then investigated how these molecules might exert their 
      neuroprotective properties. We found that three of these compounds, chenodiol, 
      fenbufen, and sulfaphenazole, act as modulators for TFEB/HLH-30, a key 
      transcriptional regulator of the autophagy process, and require this gene for 
      their neuroprotective activities. These genetic-chemical approaches, using 
      genetic C. elegans models for MJD and the screening, are promising tools to 
      understand the mechanisms and pathways causing neurodegeneration, leading to MJD. 
      Positively acting compounds may be promising candidates for investigation in 
      mammalian models of MJD and preclinical applications in the treatment of this 
      disease.

TI  - The cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome scale reveals early

PG  - 3456-3466
LID - 10.1007/s00415-021-10516-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome scale (CCAS-S) was 
      recently developed to detect specific neuropsychological deficits in patients 
      with cerebellar diseases in an expedited manner. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the 
      discriminative ability of the CCAS-S in an etiologically homogeneous cohort of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) patients and to examine relationships 
      between cognitive deficits and motor symptom severity. METHODS: The CCAS-S was 
      administered to twenty mildly to moderately affected SCA3 patients and eighteen 
      healthy controls matched for age, sex, and educational level. Disease severity 
      was measured by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), 
      Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS), 8 m walk test, nine-hole peg test (9HPT), 
      and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). RESULTS: SCA3 patients had a lower 
      total CCAS-S score (p < 0.001) and higher number of failed tests (p = 0.006) than 
      healthy controls. Patients displayed impairments in semantic fluency, phonemic 
      fluency, category switching, cube drawing, and affect regulation. Total CCAS-S 
      score showed high discriminative ability (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.96) and 
      was associated with disease duration, SARA score, walking speed, and dominant 
      hand 9HPT performance. No correlations were observed with INAS count, repeat 
      length, and PHQ-9 score. Discriminative capacity of the number of failed tests 
      was moderate (AUC: 0.76). CONCLUSION: Essentially all SCA3 patients exhibited 
      some form of cognitive impairment. The CCAS-S differentiates SCA3 patients from 
      healthy controls, detects neuropsychological deficits early in the disease 
      course, and correlates with relevant ataxia severity measures.

      atrophy.
PG  - 117-125
LID - 10.1007/s10286-020-00759-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Investigate single nucleotide variants and short tandem repeats in 39 
      genes related to spinocerebellar ataxia in clinical and pathologically defined 
      cohorts of multiple system atrophy. METHODS: Exome sequencing was conducted in 28 
      clinical multiple system atrophy patients to identify single nucleotide variants 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes. Novel variants were validated in two 
      independent disease cohorts: 86 clinically diagnosed multiple system atrophy 
      patients and 166 pathological multiple system atrophy cases. Expanded repeat 
      alleles in spinocerebellar ataxia genes were evaluated in 36 clinically diagnosed 
      multiple system atrophy patients, and CAG/CAA repeats in TATA-Box Binding Protein 
      (TBP, causative of SCA17) were screened in 216 clinical and pathological multiple 
      system atrophy patients and 346 controls. RESULTS: No known pathogenic 
      spinocerebellar ataxia single nucleotide variants or pathogenic range expanded 
      repeat alleles of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, AXTN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, 
      and TBP were detected in any clinical multiple system atrophy patients. However, 
      four novel variants were identified in four spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes 
      across three multiple system atrophy patients. Additionally, four multiple system 
      atrophy patients (1.6%) and one control (0.3%) carried an intermediate length 41 
      TBP CAG/CAA repeat allele (OR = 4.11, P = 0.21). There was a significant 
      association between the occurrence of a repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) and an increased risk of multiple system atrophy (OR = 1.64, P = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: Occurrence of TBP CAG/CAA repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) is significantly associated with increased multiple system atrophy risk. 
      This discovery warrants further investigation and supports a possible genetic 
      overlap of multiple system atrophy with SCA17.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Abnormal eye movements are common in spinocerebellar ataxias Type 3 
      (SCA3). We conducted the research to explore the frequency of abnormal eye 
      movements in Chinese patients with SCA3, to compare the demographic and clinical 
      characteristics between SCA3 patients with and without each type of abnormal eye 
      movement, and to explore the correlation between abnormal eye movements and the 
      severity of ataxia. METHODS: Seventy-four patients with SCA3 were enrolled in 
      this cross-sectional study. Six types of abnormal eye movements including 
      impaired smooth pursuit, increased square-wave jerks (SWJ), gaze-evoked nystagmus 
      (GEN), slowing of saccades, saccadic hypo/hypermetria and supranuclear gaze palsy 
      were evaluated by experienced neurologists. The severity of ataxia was evaluated 
      by Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). RESULTS: The prevalence 
      of impaired smooth pursuit, increased SWJ, GEN, slowing of saccades, saccadic 
      hypo/hypermetria and supranuclear gaze palsy in Chinese SCA3 patients was 28.4, 
      13.5, 78.4, 41.9, 23.0, and 5.4%, respectively. SCA3 patients with GEN had higher 
      scores of International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS-IV) and total 
      ICARS, and longer length of CAG repeat than patients without GEN. SCA3 patients 
      with slowing of saccades had a longer disease duration, higher scores of ICARS-I, 
      ICARS-II, total ICARS and SARA than patients without slowing of saccades. SCA3 
      patients with saccadic hypo/hypermetria had higher scores of ICARS-III, ICARS-IV, 
      and SARA than patients without saccadic hypo/hypermetria. The demographic and 
      clinical characteristics did not differ significantly between SCA3 patients with 
      and without impaired smooth pursuit, increased SWJ, or supranuclear gaze palsy. 
      Multivariate linear regression showed that the number of abnormal eye movements 
      (0-6), disease duration, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-24 (HDRS-24) score, and 
      CAG repeat length were positively correlated with SARA score, whereas Montreal 
      Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was negatively correlated with SARA score in 
      SCA3. CONCLUSIONS: An increased number of abnormal eye movement types correlated 
      with the severity of ataxia in SCA3.

TI  - Genome-wide survey of tandem repeats by nanopore sequencing shows that

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tandem repeats are highly mutable and contribute to the development 
      of human disease by a variety of mechanisms. It is difficult to predict which 
      tandem repeats may cause a disease. One hypothesis is that changeable tandem 
      repeats are the source of genetic diseases, because disease-causing repeats are 
      polymorphic in healthy individuals. However, it is not clear whether 
      disease-causing repeats are more polymorphic than other repeats. METHODS: We 
      performed a genome-wide survey of the millions of human tandem repeats using 
      publicly available long read genome sequencing data from 21 humans. We measured 
      tandem repeat copy number changes using tandem-genotypes. Length variation of 
      known disease-associated repeats was compared to other repeat loci. RESULTS: We 
      found that known Mendelian disease-causing or disease-associated repeats, 
      especially CAG and 5'UTR GGC repeats, are relatively long and polymorphic in the 
      general population. We also show that repeat lengths of two disease-causing 
      tandem repeats, in ATXN3 and GLS, are correlated with near-by GWAS SNP genotypes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We provide a catalog of polymorphic tandem repeats across a variety 
      of repeat unit lengths and sequences, from long read sequencing data. This method 
      especially if used in genome wide association study, may indicate possible new 
      candidates of pathogenic or biologically important tandem repeats in human 
      genomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Short tandem repeat (STR), or "microsatellite", is a tract of DNA in 
      which a specific motif (typically < 10 base pairs) is repeated multiple times. 
      STRs are abundant throughout the human genome, and specific repeat expansions may 
      be associated with human diseases. Long-read sequencing coupled with 
      bioinformatics tools enables the estimation of repeat counts for STRs. However, 
      with the exception of a few well-known disease-relevant STRs, normal ranges of 
      repeat counts for most STRs in human populations are not well known, preventing 
      the prioritization of STRs that may be associated with human diseases. RESULTS: 
      In this study, we extend a computational tool RepeatHMM to infer normal ranges of 
      432,604 STRs using 21 long-read sequencing datasets on human genomes, and build a 
      genomic-scale database called RepeatHMM-DB with normal repeat ranges for these 
      STRs. Evaluation on 13 well-known repeats show that the inferred repeat ranges 
      provide good estimation to repeat ranges reported in literature from 
      population-scale studies. This database, together with a repeat expansion 
      estimation tool such as RepeatHMM, enables genomic-scale scanning of repeat 
      regions in newly sequenced genomes to identify disease-relevant repeat 
      expansions. As a case study of using RepeatHMM-DB, we evaluate the CAG repeats of 
      ATXN3 for 20 patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) and 5 unaffected 
      individuals, and correctly classify each individual. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, 
      RepeatHMM-DB can facilitate prioritization and identification of disease-relevant 
      STRs from whole-genome long-read sequencing data on patients with undiagnosed 
      diseases. RepeatHMM-DB is incorporated into RepeatHMM and is available at 
      https://github.com/WGLab/RepeatHMM .

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3 and Huntington disease are 
      neurodegenerative disorders caused by expanded CAG repeats. METHODS: We performed 
      an in-silico analysis of CAG repeats in ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, and HTT using 30x 
      whole-=genome sequencing data of 2504 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. 
      RESULTS: Seven HTT-positive, 3 ATXN2-positive, 1 ATXN3-positive, and 6 possibly 
      ATXN1-positive samples were identified. No correlation was found between the 
      repeat sizes of the different genes. The distribution of CAG alleles varied by 
      ethnicity. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that there may be asymptomatic small 
      expanded repeats in almost 0.5% of these populations. (c) 2020 International

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene encoding the ataxin-3 protein. 
      Despite extensive research the exact pathogenic mechanisms of SCA3 are still not 
      understood in depth. In the present study, to gain insight into the toxicity 
      induced by the expanded CAG repeats in SCA3, we comprehensively investigated 
      repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation in various cellular models expressing 
      translated or non-canonically translated ATXN3 sequences with an increasing 
      number of CAG repeats. We demonstrate that two SCA3 RAN proteins, polyglutamine 
      (polyQ) and polyalanine (polyA), are found only in the case of CAG repeats of 
      pathogenic length. Despite having distinct cellular localization, RAN polyQ and 
      RAN polyA proteins are very often coexpressed in the same cell, impairing nuclear 
      integrity and inducing apoptosis. We provide for the first time mechanistic 
      insights into SCA3 RAN translation indicating that ATXN3 sequences surrounding 
      the repeat region have an impact on SCA3 RAN translation initiation and 
      efficiency. We revealed that RAN translation of polyQ proteins starts at 
      non-cognate codons upstream of the CAG repeats, whereas RAN polyA proteins are 
      likely translated within repeats. Furthermore, integrated stress response 
      activation enhances SCA3 RAN translation. Our findings suggest that the ATXN3 
      sequence context plays an important role in triggering SCA3 RAN translation and 
      that SCA3 RAN proteins may cause cellular toxicity.

TI  - Toward allele-specific targeting therapy and pharmacodynamic marker for 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the 
      ataxin-3 gene (ATXN3), is characterized by neuronal polyglutamine (polyQ) ATXN3 
      protein aggregates. Although there is no cure for SCA3, gene-silencing approaches 
      to reduce toxic polyQ ATXN3 showed promise in preclinical models. However, a 
      major limitation in translating putative treatments for this rare disease to the 
      clinic is the lack of pharmacodynamic markers for use in clinical trials. Here, 
      we developed an immunoassay that readily detects polyQ ATXN3 proteins in human 
      biological fluids and discriminates patients with SCA3 from healthy controls and 
      individuals with other ataxias. We show that polyQ ATXN3 serves as a marker of 
      target engagement in human fibroblasts, which may bode well for its use in 
      clinical trials. Last, we identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism that 
      strongly associates with the expanded allele, thus providing an exciting drug 
      target to abrogate detrimental events initiated by mutant ATXN3. Gene-silencing 
      strategies for several repeat diseases are well under way, and our results are 
      expected to improve clinical trial preparedness for SCA3 therapies.

      cytosine adenine guanine (CAG) repeats are unknown. METHODS/RESULTS: We have 
      identified a 9-base pair duplication in the 2-gene ATXN2 sense/antisense region. 
      The duplication was found in a Swedish family with spinocerebellar ataxia 3 with 
      parkinsonism, conferring a deviated age at onset unexplained by the concomitant 
      presence of ATXN2 intermediate alleles. Similarly, C9ORF72 amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis cases bearing the same duplication had earlier age at onset than those 
      with C9ORF72 and ATXN2 intermediate alleles. No effect was evident in Parkinson's 
      disease (PD) cases without known PD gene mutations. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the 
      first genetic alteration other than the known intermediate-range CAG repeats in 
      ATXN2. This 9-base pair duplication may act as an additional hit among carriers 
      of pathological nucleotide expansions in ATXN3 and C9ORF72 with ATXN2 
      intermediate. (c) 2020 The Authors. Movement Disorders published by Wiley

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), 
      the expanded cytosine adenine guanine (CAG) repeat in ATXN3 is the causal 
      mutation, and its length is the main factor in determining the age at onset (AO) 
      of clinical symptoms. However, the contribution of the expanded CAG repeat length 
      to the rate of disease progression after onset has remained a matter of debate, 
      even though an understanding of this factor is crucial for experimental data on 
      disease modifiers and their translation to clinical trials and their design. 
      METHODS: Eighty-two Dutch patients with SCA3/MJD were evaluated annually for 
      15 years using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). Using 
      linear growth curve models, ICARS progression rates were calculated and tested 
      for their relation to the length of the CAG repeat expansion and to the residual 
      age at onset (RAO): The difference between the observed AO and the AO predicted 
      on the basis of the CAG repeat length. RESULTS: On average, ICARS scores 
      increased 2.57 points/year of disease. The length of the CAG repeat was 
      positively correlated with a more rapid ICARS progression, explaining 30% of the 
      differences between patients. Combining both the length of the CAG repeat and RAO 
      as comodifiers explained up to 47% of the interpatient variation in ICARS 
      progression. INTERPRETATION: Our data imply that the length of the expanded CAG 
      repeat in ATXN3 is a major determinant of clinical decline, which suggests that 
      CAG-dependent molecular mechanisms similar to those responsible for disease onset 
      also contribute to the rate of disease progression in SCA3/MJD. ANN NEUROL

TI  - Conversion of individuals at risk for spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, and 6 
      to manifest ataxia (RISCA): a longitudinal cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative diseases. Our aim was to study the conversion to manifest 
      ataxia among apparently healthy carriers of mutations associated with the most 
      common SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6), and the sensitivity of clinical and 
      functional measures to detect change in these individuals. METHODS: In this 
      prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study, based at 14 referral 
      centres in seven European countries, we enrolled children or siblings of patients 
      with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6. Eligible individuals were those without ataxia, 
      defined by a score on the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) of 
      less than 3; participants had to be aged 18-50 years for children or siblings of 
      patients with SCA1, SCA2, or SCA3, and 35-70 years for children or siblings of 
      patients with SCA6. Study visits took place at recruitment and after 2, 4, and 6 
      years (plus or minus 3 months). We did genetic testing to identify mutation 
      carriers, with results concealed to the participant and clinical investigator. We 
      assessed patients with clinical scales, questionnaires of patient-reported 
      outcome measures, a rating of the examiner's confidence of presence of ataxia, 
      and performance-based coordination tests. Conversion to ataxia was defined by an 
      SARA score of 3 or higher. We analysed the association of factors at baseline 
      with conversion to ataxia and the evolution of outcome parameters on temporal 
      scales (time from inclusion and time to predicted age at ataxia onset) in the 
      context of mutation status and conversion status. This study is registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01037777. FINDINGS: Between Sept 13, 2008, and Oct 28, 
      2015, 302 participants were enrolled. We analysed data for 252 participants with 
      at least one follow-up visit. 83 (33%) participants were from families affected 
      by SCA1, 99 (39%) by SCA2, 46 (18%) by SCA3, and 24 (10%) by SCA6. In 
      participants who carried SCA mutations, 26 (52%) of 50 SCA1 carriers, 22 (59%) of 
      37 SCA2 carriers, 11 (42%) of 26 SCA3 carriers, and two (13%) of 15 SCA6 carriers 
      converted to ataxia. One (3%) of 33 SCA1 non-carriers and one (2%) of 62 SCA2 
      non-carriers converted to ataxia. Owing to the small number of people who met our 
      criteria for ataxia, subsequent analyses could not be done in carriers of the 
      SCA6 mutation. Baseline factors associated with conversion were age (hazard ratio 
      1.13 [95% CI 1.03-1.24]; p=0.011), CAG repeat length (1.25 [1.11-1.41]; 
      p=0.0002), and ataxia confidence rating (1.72 [1.23-2.41]; p=0.0015) for SCA1; 
      age (1.08 [1.02-1.14]; p=0.0077) and CAG repeat length (1.65 [1.27-2.13]; 
      p=0.0001) for SCA2; and age (1.27 [1.09-1.50]; p=0.0031), confidence rating (2.60 
      [1.23-5.47]; p=0.012), and double vision (14.83 [2.15-102.44]; p=0.0063) for 
      SCA3. From the time of inclusion, the SARA scores of SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 
      mutation carriers increased, whereas they remained stable in non-carriers. On a 
      timescale defined by the predicted time of ataxia onset, SARA progression in 
      SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 mutation carriers was non-linear, with marginal progression 
      before ataxia and increasing progression after ataxia onset. INTERPRETATION: Our 
      study provides quantitative data on the conversion of non-ataxic SCA1, SCA2, and 
      SCA3 mutation carriers to manifest ataxia. Our data could prove useful for the 
      design of preventive trials aimed at delaying the onset of ataxia by aiding 
      sample size calculations and stratification of study participants. FUNDING:

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a hereditary 
      neurodegenerative disorder with high clinical heterogeneity. Twin study is 
      valuable to estimate the contributions of gene and/or environment to phenotypic 
      variance. However, SCA3 twins were extremely sparse and rarely reported. METHODS: 
      A pair of monozygotic twins with SCA3 was assessed using well-acknowledged 
      scales. Genetic modifiers and methylation levels were determined by Sanger 
      sequencing and pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Sharing identical CAG repeat lengths, the 
      twins presented with similar symptoms, whereas, the younger sister had an earlier 
      age at onset of two years. The occurrence time and severity of constipation, 
      blepharospasm and fasciculation were markedly different between the twins. 
      Notable methylation level differences of several CpG sites existed between the 
      twins. CONCLUSIONS: It is the first time to report SCA3 monozygotic twin 
      worldwide. The role of epigenetic factors in the phenotype variance deserved more 
      attention. The DNA methylation may influence the phenotypic variance by altering 
      the occurrence time and severity of symptoms, indicating its potential in 
      alleviating the disease.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by CAG (encoding glutamine) repeat expansion in the Ataxin-3 
      (ATXN3) gene. We have shown previously that ATXN3-depleted or pathogenic 
      ATXN3-expressing cells abrogate polynucleotide kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP) 
      activity. Here, we report that ATXN3 associates with RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) 
      and the classical nonhomologous end-joining (C-NHEJ) proteins, including PNKP, 
      along with nascent RNAs under physiological conditions. Notably, ATXN3 depletion 
      significantly decreased global transcription, repair of transcribed genes, and 
      error-free double-strand break repair of a 3'-phosphate-containing terminally 
      gapped, linearized reporter plasmid. The missing sequence at the terminal break 
      site was restored in the recircularized plasmid in control cells by using the 
      endogenous homologous transcript as a template, indicating ATXN3's role in 
      PNKP-mediated error-free C-NHEJ. Furthermore, brain extracts from SCA3 patients 
      and mice show significantly lower PNKP activity, elevated p53BP1 level, more 
      abundant strand-breaks in the transcribed genes, and degradation of RNAP II 
      relative to controls. A similar RNAP II degradation is also evident in mutant 
      ATXN3-expressing Drosophila larval brains and eyes. Importantly, SCA3 phenotype 
      in Drosophila was completely amenable to PNKP complementation. Hence, salvaging 
      PNKP's activity can be a promising therapeutic strategy for SCA3.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an 
      autosomal dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Patients present with 
      cerebellar ataxia, dystonia, rigidity, and neuropathy that worsen with time. On a 
      molecular level, it occurs due to a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 
      ATXN3 gene. Due to the risk of pulmonary aspiration, hypoventilation, autonomic 
      and thermoregulatory dysfunction, vocal cord paralysis, progressive paraplegia, 
      parkinsonian symptoms, and chronic pain, it has significant anesthesia 
      implications. Rarely, case reports occur in the literature describing regional 
      anesthetic management of patients with SCA3, but none that describe general 
      anesthesia specifically with MJD. We therefore describe a case of a patient with 
      SCA3 who successfully underwent general anesthesia and considerations for 
      perioperative management of this patient population.

AB  - Genetic testing for neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) is highly challenging 
      because of genetic heterogeneity and overlapping manifestations. Targeted-gene 
      panels (TGPs), coupled with next-generation sequencing (NGS), can facilitate the 
      profiling of a large repertoire of ND-related genes. Due to the technical 
      limitations inherent in NGS and TGPs, short tandem repeat (STR) variations are 
      often ignored. However, STR expansions are known to cause such NDs as 
      Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxias type 3 (SCA3). Here, we studied 
      the clinical utility of a custom-made TGP that targets 199 NDs and 311 
      ND-associated genes on 118 undiagnosed patients. At least one known or likely 
      pathogenic variation was found in 54 patients; 27 patients demonstrated clinical 
      profiles that matched the variants; and 16 patients whose original diagnosis were 
      refined. A high concordance of variant calling were observed when comparing the 
      results from TGP and whole-exome sequencing of four patients. Our in-house STR 
      detection algorithm has reached a specificity of 0.88 and a sensitivity of 0.82 
      in our SCA3 cohort. This study also uncovered a trove of novel and recurrent 
      variants that may enrich the repertoire of ND-related genetic markers. We propose 
      that a combined comprehensive TGPs-bioinformatics pipeline can improve the 
      clinical diagnosis of NDs.

AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 3 (SCA3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease) is a 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion encoding an 
      abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the disease protein, ataxin-3 
      (ATXN3). No preventive treatment is yet available for SCA3. Because SCA3 is 
      likely caused by a toxic gain of ATXN3 function, a rational therapeutic strategy 
      is to reduce mutant ATXN3 levels by targeting pathways that control its 
      production or stability. Here, we sought to identify genes that modulate ATXN3 
      levels as potential therapeutic targets in this fatal disorder. We screened a 
      collection of siRNAs targeting 2742 druggable human genes using a cell-based 
      assay based on luminescence readout of polyQ-expanded ATXN3. From 317 candidate 
      genes identified in the primary screen, 100 genes were selected for validation. 
      Among the 33 genes confirmed in secondary assays, 15 were validated in an 
      independent cell model as modulators of pathogenic ATXN3 protein levels. Ten of 
      these genes were then assessed in a Drosophila model of SCA3, and one was 
      confirmed as a key modulator of physiological ATXN3 abundance in SCA3 neuronal 
      progenitor cells. Among the 15 genes shown to modulate ATXN3 in mammalian cells, 
      orthologs of CHD4, FBXL3, HR and MC3R regulate mutant ATXN3-mediated toxicity in 
      fly eyes. Further mechanistic studies of one of these genes, FBXL3, encoding a 
      F-box protein that is a component of the SKP1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase 
      complex, showed that it reduces levels of normal and pathogenic ATXN3 in SCA3 
      neuronal progenitor cells, primarily via a SCF complex-dependent manner. 
      Bioinformatic analysis of the 15 genes revealed a potential molecular network 
      with connections to tumor necrosis factor-alpha/nuclear factor-kappa B (TNF/NF-kB) 
      and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathways. Overall, we 
      identified 15 druggable genes with diverse functions to be suppressors or 
      enhancers of pathogenic ATXN3 abundance. Among identified pathways highlighted by 
      this screen, the FBXL3/SCF axis represents a novel molecular pathway that 
      regulates physiological levels of ATXN3 protein.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion within the ATXN3/MJD1 gene. The 
      expanded CAG repeats encode a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract at the C-terminus of 
      the ATXN3 protein. ATXN3 containing expanded polyQ forms aggregates, leading to 
      subsequent cellular dysfunctions including an impaired ubiquitin-proteasome 
      system (UPS). To investigate the pathogenesis of SCA3 and develop potential 
      therapeutic strategies, we established induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines 
      from SCA3 patients (SCA3-iPSC). Neurons derived from SCA3-iPSCs formed aggregates 
      that are positive to the polyQ marker 1C2. Treatment with the proteasome 
      inhibitor, MG132, on SCA3-iPSC-derived neurons downregulated proteasome activity, 
      increased production of radical oxygen species (ROS), and upregulated the cleaved 
      caspase 3 level and caspase 3 activity. This increased susceptibility to the 
      proteasome inhibitor can be rescued by a Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) extract 
      NH037 (from Pueraria lobata) and its constituent daidzein via upregulating 
      proteasome activity and reducing protein ubiquitination, oxidative stress, 
      cleaved caspase 3 level, and caspase 3 activity. Our results successfully 
      recapitulate the key phenotypes of the neurons derived from SCA3 patients, as 
      well as indicate the potential of NH037 and daidzein in the treatment for SCA3 
      patients.

AB  - Background: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is 
      one of the nine polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases and is caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion within the coding sequence of the ATXN3 gene. Few multimodal imaging 
      analyses of the macro- and micro-structural changes have been performed. Methods: 
      In the present study, we recruited 31 genetically-confirmed symptomatic SCA3/MJD 
      patients and 31 healthy subjects as controls for a multimodal neuroimaging study 
      using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), proton magnetic resonance 
      spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Results: The SCA3/MJD 
      patients displayed a significantly reduced of gray matter volume in the 
      cerebellum, pons, midbrain and medulla, as well as inferior frontal gyrus and 
      insula, and left superior frontal gyrus. The total International Cooperative 
      Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) score was inversely correlated with the gray matter 
      volume in the cerebellar culmen, pons and midbrain. The numbers of CAG repeats in 
      the expanded alleles were inversely correlated with the gray matter in the 
      cerebellar culmen. NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho ratio in the middle cerebellar peduncles, 
      dentate nucleus, cerebellar vermis, and thalamus in the SCA3/MJD patients were 
      significantly reduced when compared to that in the normal controls, suggesting 
      neurochemical alterations in cerebellum in the SCA3/MJD patients. Tract-Based 
      Spatial Statistics (TBSS) analysis revealed significant lower volume and mean FA 
      values of the cerebellar peduncles, which inversely correlated with the total 
      scores of ICARS in our patients. Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrated 
      cerebellar degeneration in SCA3/MJD based on tissue volume, neurochemistry, and 
      tissue microstructure. Moreover, the associations between the clinical measures, 
      cerebellar degeneration and genetic variation support a distinct 
      genotype-phenotype relationship in SCA3/MJD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dystonia is a relatively common feature of spinocerebellar ataxia 3 
      (SCA3). Childhood onset of SCA3 is rare and typically associated with either 
      relatively large, or homozygous, CAG repeat expansions. CASE REPORT: We describe 
      a 10-year-old girl with SCA3, who presented with tongue dystonia in addition to 
      limb dystonia and gait ataxia due to a heterozygous expansion of 84 repeats in 
      ATXN3. DISCUSSION: Diagnosis of the SCAs can be challenging, and even more so in 
      children. Tongue dystonia has not previously been documented in SCA3.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) and type 1 (SCA1) are dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative disorders that are currently incurable. Both diseases are 
      caused by a CAG-repeat expansion in exon 10 of the Ataxin-3 and exon 8 of the 
      Ataxin-1 gene, respectively, encoding an elongated polyglutamine tract that 
      confers toxic properties to the resulting proteins. We have previously shown 
      lowering of the pathogenic polyglutamine protein in Huntington's disease mouse 
      models using (CUG)7, a CAG repeat-targeting antisense oligonucleotide. Here we 
      evaluated the therapeutic capacity of (CUG)7 for SCA3 and SCA1, in vitro in 
      patient-derived cell lines and in vivo in representative mouse models. Repeated 
      intracerebroventricular (CUG)7 administration resulted in a significant reduction 
      of mutant Ataxin-3 and Ataxin-1 proteins throughout the brain of SCA3 and SCA1 
      mouse models, respectively. Furthermore, in both a SCA3 patient cell line and the 
      MJD84.2 mouse model, (CUG)7 induced formation of a truncated Ataxin-3 protein 
      species lacking the polyglutamine stretch, likely arising from (CUG)7-mediated 
      exon 10 skipping. In contrast, skipping of exon 8 of Ataxin-1 did not 
      significantly contribute to the Ataxin-1 protein reduction observed in 
      (CUG)7-treated SCA1(154Q/2Q) mice. These findings support the therapeutic 
      potential of a single CAG repeat-targeting AON for the treatment of multiple 
      polyglutamine disorders.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a fatal, late-onset neurodegenerative 
      disorder characterized by selective neuropathology in the brainstem, cerebellum, 
      spinal cord, and substantia nigra. Here we report the first NIH-approved human 
      embryonic stem cell (hESC) line derived from an embryo harboring the SCA3 
      mutation. Referred to as SCA3-hESC, this line is heterozygous for the mutant 
      polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. We observed 
      relevant molecular hallmarks of the human disease at all differentiation stages 
      from stem cells to cortical neurons, including robust ATXN3 aggregation and 
      altered expression of key components of the protein quality control machinery. In 
      addition, SCA3-hESCs exhibit nuclear accumulation of mutant ATXN3 and form 
      p62-positive aggresomes. Finally, antisense oligonucleotide-mediated reduction of 
      ATXN3 markedly suppressed aggresome formation. The SCA3-hESC line offers a unique 
      and highly relevant human disease model that holds strong potential to advance 
      understanding of SCA3 disease mechanisms and facilitate the evaluation of 
      candidate therapies for SCA3.

AB  - The most commonly inherited dominant ataxia, Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 
      (SCA3), is caused by a CAG repeat expansion that encodes an abnormally long 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat in the disease protein ataxin-3, a deubiquitinase. 
      Two major full-length isoforms of ataxin-3 exist, both of which contain the same 
      N-terminal portion and polyQ repeat, but differ in their C-termini; one (denoted 
      here as isoform 1) contains a motif that binds ataxin-3's substrate, ubiquitin, 
      whereas the other (denoted here as isoform 2) has a hydrophobic tail. Most SCA3 
      studies have focused on isoform 1, the predominant version in mammalian brain, 
      yet both isoforms are present in brain and a better understanding of their 
      relative pathogenicity in vivo is needed. We took advantage of the fruit fly, 
      Drosophila melanogaster to model SCA3 and to examine the toxicity of each 
      ataxin-3 isoform. Our assays reveal isoform 1 to be markedly more toxic than 
      isoform 2 in all fly tissues. Reduced toxicity from isoform 2 is due to much 
      lower protein levels as a result of its expedited degradation. Additional studies 
      indicate that isoform 1 is more aggregation-prone than isoform 2 and that the 
      C-terminus of isoform 2 is critical for its enhanced proteasomal degradation. 
      According to our results, although both full-length, pathogenic ataxin-3 isoforms 
      are toxic, isoform 1 is likely the primary contributor to SCA3 due to its 
      presence at higher levels. Isoform 2, as a result of rapid degradation that is 
      dictated by its tail, is unlikely to be a key player in this disease. Our 
      findings provide new insight into the biology of this ataxia and the cellular 
      processing of the underlying disease protein.

AB  - Genomic technologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) are revolutionizing 
      molecular diagnostics and clinical medicine. However, these approaches have 
      proven inefficient at identifying pathogenic repeat expansions. Here, we apply a 
      collection of bioinformatics tools that can be utilized to identify either known 
      or novel expanded repeat sequences in NGS data. We performed genetic studies of a 
      cohort of 35 individuals from 22 families with a clinical diagnosis of cerebellar 
      ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). 
      Analysis of whole-genome sequence (WGS) data with five independent algorithms 
      identified a recessively inherited intronic repeat expansion [(AAGGG)(exp)] in 
      the gene encoding Replication Factor C1 (RFC1). This motif, not reported in the 
      reference sequence, localized to an Alu element and replaced the reference 
      (AAAAG)(11) short tandem repeat. Genetic analyses confirmed the pathogenic 
      expansion in 18 of 22 CANVAS-affected families and identified a core ancestral 
      haplotype, estimated to have arisen in Europe more than twenty-five thousand 
      years ago. WGS of the four RFC1-negative CANVAS-affected families identified 
      plausible variants in three, with genomic re-diagnosis of SCA3, spastic ataxia of 
      the Charlevoix-Saguenay type, and SCA45. This study identified the genetic basis 
      of CANVAS and demonstrated that these improved bioinformatics tools increase the 
      diagnostic utility of WGS to determine the genetic basis of a heterogeneous group 
      of clinically overlapping neurogenetic disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of more than one polyQ-related gene within a single 
      individual is a rare incidence, which may provide the potential opportunity to 
      study the combined effects of these spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) genes. METHODS: 
      We retrospectively analyzed genetic data from 112 SCA3 probands and found Patient 
      1 harbored expanded ATXN2 allele (33 repeats) and intermediate TBP allele (41 
      repeats), and Patient 2 with intermediate ATXN2 allele (32 repeats). Detailed 
      clinical and oculomotor performances were investigated. The age at onset and 
      oculomotor parameters of both patients were compared with matched pure SCA3 
      groups controlling either disease severity or CAG repeats. RESULTS: Most of the 
      clinical phenotypes and oculomotor characteristics of these two patients were 
      common to typical SCA3 patients. Compared to pure SCA3 groups controlling disease 
      severity, mild reduced horizontal saccade velocity could be detected in both 
      patients. However, mild expansions of the ATXN2 allele seemed to have no 
      influence on the age at onset of Patient 1 but might have a mild impact on 
      Patient 2. CONCLUSION: Our study provides supporting evidence that mild 
      expansions of ATXN2 may have modifying effects on SCA3 phenotype. Larger control 
      series and longitudinal data are warranted to confirm our results.

TI  - (CAG)(n) loci as genetic modifiers of age at onset in patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 from mainland China.
PG  - 1130-1136
LID - 10.1111/ene.13954 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The expanded repeat length in ATXN1 negatively correlates 
      with age at onset (AAO) of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) but can explain 
      only part of it, indicating that other factors affect AAO. Some studies have 
      explored the influence of non-causative CAG repeats on the AAO of SCA patients. 
      However, studies on Chinese SCA1 patients regarding candidate modifier factors 
      involved in the variability in AAO are rare. METHODS: In all, 152 Chinese SCA1 
      patients who were genotyped for ATXN1 and nine other (CAG)(n) -containing genes 
      were enrolled. Regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of the 
      expanded allele of ATXN1 (linear and quadratic effects) on AAO. Then, different 
      models were used to explore the modulatory effect of nine other (CAG)(n) 
      -containing genes. RESULTS: Our results verified the negative effect of the 
      expanded allele in ATXN1 by regression analysis. Some (CAG)(n) -containing genes 
      including TBP, ATN1 and HTT modified AAO with variance ranging from 0.8% to 3.8% 
      and tended to decrease or delay AAO. However, no modifier effects of ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, KCNN3, RAI1 and normal ATXN1 alleles in trans were 
      detected. CONCLUSION: By using interaction analyses, TBP, ATN1 and HTT were 
      determined to have modifying effects. Our study revealed that differences in 
      modulation may be due to ethnic and geographic diversity across different 
      populations. Furthermore, the variability of AAO was not completely explained by 
      the genetic modifiers examined here, suggesting that other genetic or 
      environmental factors are involved in these diseases.

AB  - Objectives: Our study attempted to systematically explore the prevalence of 
      extra-cerebellar signs and non-motor symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, 
      fatigue, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and sleep disturbances in a cohort of 
      Chinese patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), and further 
      investigated the correlations between non-motor symptoms and clinical 
      characteristics in SCA3 patients. Methods: This study included 68 
      molecular-proven SCA3 patients. Extra-cerebellar signs were evaluated with the 
      Inventory of Non-Ataxia Symptoms (INAS). The INAS count indicated the number of 
      non-ataxia signs in each patient. The severity of ataxia, fatigue, EDS, sleep 
      quality, anxiety, and depression were assessed using the Scale for the assessment 
      and rating of ataxia (SARA), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Epworth Sleepiness 
      Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale 
      (HAMA), and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) (24 items), respectively. 
      Results: Extra-cerebellar signs were detected in 91.2% of all SCA3 patients and 
      the mean total INAS count was 2.72 +/- 1.88. Rigidity was the most frequent 
      extra-cerebellar sign (47.1%, N = 32). Sensory symptoms (2.9%, N = 2) and chorea 
      (5.9%, N = 4) were rare, and myoclonus (0%) was not found in this cohort. High 
      frequencies of sleep disturbances (64.7%), fatigue (52.9%), depression (48.5%), 
      and anxiety (42.6%) were detected in SCA3 patients. The Spearman correlation 
      indicated that the HAMD score was associated with the CAG repeat length and HAMA 
      score, while the PSQI score was correlated with the SARA and FSS score. In 
      addition, multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the CAG repeat 
      length, age of onset, sleep disturbances and depression were significant 
      predictors of fatigue in SCA3 patients. Conclusions: Our study indicates that the 
      vast majority of SCA3 patients display extra-cerebellar signs. Except for EDS, 
      anxiety, depression, fatigue and impaired sleep quality are present in SCA3 
      patients. The CAG repeat length, age of onset, sleep disturbances and depression 
      are predictors of fatigue in SCA3 patients.

      The Example of MJD/SCA3 Locus.
PG  - 38

LID - 38
AB  - At least 40 human diseases are associated with repeat expansions; yet, the 
      mutational origin and instability mechanisms remain unknown for most of them. 
      Previously, genetic epidemiology and predisposing backgrounds for the instability 
      of some expanding loci have been studied in different populations through the 
      analysis of diversity flanking the respective pathogenic repeats. Here, we aimed 
      at developing a pipeline to assess disease-associated haplotypes at 
      oligonucleotide repeat loci, combining analysis of single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) and short tandem repeats (STRs). Machado-Joseph disease 
      (MJD/SCA3), the most frequent dominant ataxia worldwide, was used as an example 
      of a detailed procedure. Thus, to identify genetic backgrounds that segregate 
      with expanded/mutated alleles in MJD, we selected a set of 26 SNPs and 7 STRs 
      flanking the causative CAG repeat. Key criteria and steps for this selection are 
      described, and included (1) haplotype blocks minimizing the occurrence of 
      recombination (for SNPs); and (2) match scores to increase potential for 
      polymorphic information content of repetitive sequences found in Tandem Repeats 
      Finder (for STRs). To directly assess SNP haplotypes in phase with MJD 
      expansions, we optimized a strategy with preferential amplification of normal 
      over expanded alleles, in addition to SNP allele-specific amplifications; this 
      allowed the identification of disease-associated SNP haplotypes, even when only 
      the proband is available in a given family. To infer STR haplotypes, we optimized 
      a multiplex PCR, including 7 STRs plus the MJD_CAG repeat, followed by analysis 
      of segregation or the use of the PHASE software. This protocol is a ready-to-use 
      tool to assess MJD haplotypes in different populations. The pipeline designed can 
      be used to assess disease-associated haplotypes in other repeat-expansion 
      diseases. This should be of great utility to study (1) genetic epidemiology 
      (population-of-origin, age and spreading routes of mutations) and (2) mechanisms 
      responsible for de novo expansions, in these neurological diseases; (3) to detect 
      predisposing haplotypes and (4) phenotype modifiers; (5) to help solving cases of 
      apparent homoallelism (two same-size normal alleles) in diagnosis; and (6) to 
      identify the best targets for the development of allele-specific therapies in 
      ethnically diverse patient populations.

AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases describe a group of progressive neurodegenerative 
      disorders caused by the CAG triplet repeat expansion in the coding region of the 
      disease genes. To date, nine such diseases, including spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3 (SCA3), have been reported. The formation of SDS-insoluble protein aggregates 
      in neurons causes cellular dysfunctions, such as impairment of the 
      ubiquitin-proteasome system, and contributes to polyQ pathologies. Recently, the 
      E3 ubiquitin ligases, which govern substrate specificity of the 
      ubiquitin-proteasome system, have been implicated in polyQ pathogenesis. The 
      Cullin (Cul) proteins are major components of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases 
      (CRLs) complexes that are evolutionarily conserved in the Drosophila genome. In 
      this study, we examined the effect of individual Culs on SCA3 pathogenesis and 
      found that the knockdown of Cul1 expression enhances SCA3-induced 
      neurodegeneration and reduces the solubility of expanded SCA3-polyQ proteins. The 
      F-box proteins are substrate receptors of Cul1-based CRL. We further performed a 
      genetic modifier screen of the 19 Drosophila F-box genes and identified F-box 
      involved in polyQ pathogenesis (FipoQ) as a genetic modifier of SCA3 degeneration 
      that modulates the ubiquitination and solubility of expanded SCA3-polyQ proteins. 
      In the human SK-N-MC cell model, we identified that F-box only protein 33 
      (FBXO33) exerts similar functions as FipoQ in modulating the ubiquitination and 
      solubility of expanded SCA3-polyQ proteins. Taken together, our study 
      demonstrates that Cul1-based CRL and its associated F-box protein, FipoQ/FBXO33, 
      modify SCA3 protein toxicity. These findings will lead to a better understanding 
      of the disease mechanism of SCA3 and provide insights for developing treatments 
      against SCA3. Cover Image for this issue: doi: 10.1111/jnc.14510.

TI  - Large normal alleles of ATXN2 decrease age at onset in transthyretin familial 
      amyloid polyneuropathy Val30Met patients.
PG  - 251-258
LID - 10.1002/ana.25409 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Transthyretin (TTR)-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is 
      an autosomal dominant neurological disease, caused most frequently by a Val30Met 
      (now classified as Val50Met) substitution in TTR. Age at onset (AO) ranges from 
      19 to 82 years, and variability exists mostly between generations. Unstable 
      oligonucleotide repeats in various genes are the mechanism behind several 
      neurological diseases, found also to act as modifiers for other disorders. Our 
      aim was to investigate whether large normal repeat alleles of 10 genes had a 
      possible modifier effect in AO in Portuguese TTR-FAP Val30Met families. METHODS: 
      We analyzed 329 Portuguese patients from 123 families. Repeat length (at ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, TBP, ATN1, HTT, JPH3, AR, and DMPK) was assessed by single 
      and multiplex polymerase chain reaction, using fluorescently labeled primers, 
      followed by capillary electrophoresis. We used a family-centered approach, and 
      generalized estimating equations were used to account for AO correlation between 
      family members. RESULTS: For ATXN2, the presence of at least 1 allele longer than 
      22 CAGs was significantly associated with an earlier onset in TTR-FAP Val30Met, 
      decreasing mean AO by 6 years (95% confidence interval = -8.81 to -2.19, p = 
      0.001). No association was found for the remaining repeat loci. INTERPRETATION: 
      Length of normal repeats at ATXN2 may modify AO in TTR-FAP Val30Met and may 
      function as a risk factor. This can be due to the role of ATXN2 in RNA metabolism 
      and as a modulator of various cellular processes, including mitochondrial stress. 
      This may have relevant implications for prognosis and the follow-up of 
      presymptomatic carriers. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:251-258.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to reappraise the progression of the five 
      most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) in the Chinese population and to 
      establish a much-needed critical comparison with that in other ethnic groups. 
      There are very few longitudinal cohort studies of SCAs in Asian populations. An 
      intriguing finding in an earlier study demonstrated a faster progression of SCA 
      among Chinese than that among Caucasians. METHODS: Patients with SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, SCA6 or SCA17 were consecutively assessed using the scale for the 
      assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA) for five years. A linear mixed model was 
      used to compare the annual progression rates measured using the SARA among 
      patients with different SCA subtypes. Predictors of the progression rates were 
      analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 199 patients with SCA (10 with SCA1, 37 with SCA2, 
      118 with SCA3, 25 with SCA6 and 9 with SCA17) were enrolled. The mean annual 
      increase in SARA scores was 1.23 points for SCA1, 1.52 points for SCA2, 1.60 
      points for SCA3, 0.99 points for SCA6 and 3.26 points for SCA17. A larger CAG 
      repeat length (>/=74) was associated with faster progression in SCA3, whereas a 
      lower total SARA score at the first visit (<12) was associated with faster 
      clinical progression in SCA6. CONCLUSION: The results of this study confirm that 
      the annual progression rates of SCA2 and SCA3 are comparable between Han Chinese 
      and other ethnic populations. More studies are warranted to confirm the rapid 
      progression of SCA17 observed in our cohort.

AB  - DNA methylation has been reported as an important regulator of genomic structure 
      stability, including large tandem repeats. To test the modulation effect of 
      variants in DNA methylation-related genes on distribution of expanded (CAG)(n) 
      alleles and age at onset (AO) of patients with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), we 
      conducted an association analysis on 23 selected SNPs in these genes in 613 
      patients with MJD and 581 controls. There were significant differences in the 
      distribution of rs12957023 between patients and controls (OR = 1.296, p = 0.007 
      and OR = 1.206, p = 0.008, for genotype and alleles, respectively). The 
      distribution of (CAG)(n) size was also different between patients carrying a CC 
      and the other genotypes (TT and TC, p = 0.011 for expanded (CAG)(n) and p = 0.012 
      for normal size alleles), indicating that DNA methylation might modulate the 
      (CAG)(n) instability. We found also that rs13420827 in DNMT3A and rs7354779 in 
      DNMT3L contribute to AO of MJD (p = 0.019 and p = 0.008, respectively). In 
      conclusion, our data provide the first evidence that SNPs in DNA 
      methylation-related genes may contribute to (CAG)(n) instability and modulate the 
      AO of this disease.

AB  - Genomewide association studies (GWASs) have contributed greatly to unraveling the 
      genetic basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a large amount of "missing 
      heritability" remains. In this exploratory study, we investigated the effect of 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in polyglutamine disease-associated genes 
      (PDAGs) on the risk of AD and its expression. In a cohort of 959 patients 
      diagnosed with AD (Amsterdam Dementia cohort) and 4106 cognitively healthy 
      participants (Leiden 85-plus Study and the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in 
      the Elderly at Risk), we determined the CAG repeat sequences in ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, HTT, ATN1, and AR. We did not find a significant 
      association between the risk of AD and variations in CAG repeat numbers of PDAGs. 
      However, we found that differences in CAG repeat numbers in ATXN1, ATXN2, and AR 
      were significantly associated with several clinical and imaging features in AD 
      patients. Specifically, the association between memory performance in patients 
      with AD and the CAG repeat size in the longer ATXN1 allele, and the association 
      between atrophy in the medial temporal lobes and the CAG repeat number in the 
      longer AR allele remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Our 
      findings suggest that repeat polymorphisms in ATXN1 and AR can act as important 
      genetic modifiers of AD, warranting further scrutiny of their role in its missing 
      heritability and pathogenesis.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 
      gene which encodes the deubiquitinating enzyme, ATXN3. Several mechanisms have 
      been proposed to explain the pathogenic role of mutant, polyQ-expanded ATXN3 in 
      SCA3 including disease protein aggregation, impairment of ubiquitin-proteasomal 
      degradation and transcriptional dysregulation. A better understanding of the 
      normal functions of this protein may shed light on SCA3 disease pathogenesis. To 
      assess the potential normal role of ATXN3 in regulating gene expression, we 
      compared transcriptional profiles in WT versus Atxn3 null mouse embryonic 
      fibroblasts. Differentially expressed genes in the absence of ATXN3 contribute to 
      multiple signal transduction pathways, suggesting a status switch of signaling 
      pathways including depressed Wnt and BMP4 pathways and elevated growth factor 
      pathways such as Prolactin, TGF-beta, and Ephrin pathways. The Eph receptor A3 
      (Efna3), a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase in the Ephrin pathway that is highly 
      expressed in the nervous system, was the most differentially upregulated gene in 
      Atxn3 null MEFs. This increased expression of Efna3 was recapitulated in Atxn3 
      knockout mouse brainstem, a selectively vulnerable brain region in SCA3. 
      Overexpression of normal or expanded ATXN3 was sufficient to repress Efna3 
      expression, supporting a role for ATXN3 in regulating Ephrin signaling. We 
      further show that, in the absence of ATXN3, Efna3 upregulation is associated with 
      hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the Efna3 promoter, which in turn is 
      induced by decreased levels of HDAC3 and NCoR in ATXN3 null cells. Together, 
      these results reveal a normal role for ATXN3 in transcriptional regulation of 
      multiple signaling pathways of potential relevance to disease processes in SCA3.

TI  - Age at onset prediction in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 changes according to 
      population of origin.
PG  - 113-120

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease 
      (SCA3/MJD), the length of CAG repeat expansions in ATXN3 shows an inverse 
      correlation with age at onset (AO). Recently, a formula for predicting AO based 
      on CAG expansion was developed for European carriers. We tested this formula in 
      SCA3/MJD carriers from distinct origins and developed population-specific models 
      to predict AO. METHODS: This was a parametric survival modelling study. RESULTS: 
      The European formula (EF) was tested in 739 independent SCA3/MJD carriers from 
      South Brazil, Taiwan and the Portuguese Azorean islands, and it largely 
      underestimated AO in South Brazilian and Taiwanese test cohorts. This finding 
      challenged the universal use of the EF, leading us to develop and validate 
      population-specific models for AO prediction. Using validation cohorts, we showed 
      that Brazilian and Taiwanese formulas largely outperformed the EF in a 
      population-specific manner. Inversely, the EF was more accurate at predicting AO 
      among Portuguese Azorean patients. Hence, specific prediction models were 
      required for each SCA3/MJD ethnic group. CONCLUSIONS: Our data strongly support 
      the existence of as yet unknown factors that modulate AO in SCA3/MJD in a 
      population-dependent manner, independent of CAG expansion length. The generated 
      models are made available to the scientific community as they can be useful for 
      future studies on SCA3/MJD carriers from distinct geographical origins.

TI  - Repeat length variations in polyglutamine disease-associated genes affect body 
      mass index.
PG  - 440-449
LID - 10.1038/s41366-018-0161-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The worldwide prevalence of obesity, a major risk factor for numerous 
      debilitating chronic disorders, is increasing rapidly. Although a substantial 
      amount of the variation in body mass index (BMI) is estimated to be heritable, 
      the largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to date 
      explained only ~2.7% of the variation. To tackle this 'missing heritability' 
      problem of obesity, here we focused on the contribution of DNA repeat length 
      polymorphisms which are not detectable by GWAS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We 
      determined the cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat length in the nine known 
      polyglutamine disease-associated genes (ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, 
      HTT, ATN1 and AR) in two large cohorts consisting of 12,457 individuals and 
      analyzed their association with BMI, using generalized linear mixed-effect 
      models. RESULTS: We found a significant association between BMI and the length of 
      CAG repeats in seven polyglutamine disease-associated genes (including ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP and AR). Importantly, these repeat variations 
      could account for 0.75% of the total BMI variation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      incriminate repeat polymorphisms as an important novel class of genetic risk 
      factors of obesity and highlight the role of the brain in its pathophysiology.

TI  - Dystonia in Patients with Spinocerebellar Ataxia 3 - Machado-Joseph disease: An 
      Underestimated Diagnosis?
PG  - 41-49
LID - 10.2174/1874205X01812010041 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 3 (SCA3) or Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD) 
      is characterized by cerebellar, central and peripheral symptoms, including 
      movement disorders. Dystonia can be classified as hereditary and 
      neurodegenerative when present in SCA3. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study 
      was to evaluate the dystonia characteristics in patients with MJD. METHOD: We 
      identified all SCA3 patients with dystonia from the SCA3 HC-UFPR database, 
      between December 2015 and December 2016.Their medical records were reviewed to 
      verify the diagnosis of dystonia and obtain demographic and clinical data. 
      Standardized evaluation was carried out through the classification of Movement 
      Disorders Society of 2013 and Burke Fahn-Marsden scale (BFM). RESULTS: Amongst 
      the presenting some common characteristics, 381 patients with SCA3, 14 (3.7%) 
      subjects presented dystonia: 5 blepharospasm, 1 cervical dystonia, 3 
      oromandibular, 3 multifocal and 2 generalized dystonia. Regarding dystonia's 
      subtypes, 71.4% had SCA3 subtype I and 28.6% SCA3 subtype II. The average age of 
      the disease onset was 40+/-10.7 years; the SCA3 disease duration was 11.86+/- 6.13 
      years; the CAG repeat lengths ranged from 75 to 78, and the BFM scores ranged 
      from 1.0 to 40. There was no correlation between the dystonia severity and CAG 
      repeat lengths or the SCA3 clinical evolution. CONCLUSION: Dystonia in SCA3 is 
      frequent and displays highly variable clinical profiles and severity grades. 
      Dystonia is therefore a present symptom in SCA3, which may precede the SCA3 
      classic symptoms. Dystonia diagnosis is yet to be properly recognized within SCA3 
      patient.

TI  - Long-term evolution of patient-reported outcome measures in spinocerebellar 
      ataxias.
PG  - 2040-2051
LID - 10.1007/s00415-018-8954-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To study the long-term evolution of patient-reported outcome 
      measures (PROMs) in the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), we analyzed 
      8 years follow-up data of the EUROSCA Natural History Study, a cohort study of 
      526 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6. METHODS: To assess the functional 
      capacity in daily living, we used the functional assessment (part IV) of the 
      Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS-IV), for health-related quality 
      of life the visual analogue scale of the EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire 
      (EQ-5D VAS), and for depressive symptoms the Patient Health Questionnaire 
      (PHQ-9). Severity of ataxia was assessed using the Scale for the Assessment and 
      Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and neurological symptoms other than ataxia with the 
      Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS). RESULTS: UHDRS-IV [SCA1: - 1.35 (0.12); 
      SCA2: - 1.15 (0.11); SCA3: - 1.16 (0.11); SCA6: - 0.99 (0.12)] and EQ-5D [SCA1: 
      - 2.88 (0.72); SCA2: - 1.97 (0.49); SCA3: - 2.06 (0.55); SCA6: - 1.03 (0.57)] 
      decreased linearly, whereas PHQ-9 increased [SCA1: 0.15 (0.04); SCA2: 0.09 
      (0.03); SCA3: 0.06 (0.04); SCA6: 0.07 (0.04)] during the observational period. 
      Standard response means (SRMs) of UHDRS-IV (0.473-0.707) and EQ-5D VAS 
      (0.053-0.184) were lower than that of SARA (0.404-0.979). In SCA1, higher SARA 
      scores [- 0.0288 (0.01), p = 0.0251], longer repeat expansions [- 0.0622 (0.02), 
      p = 0.0002] and the presence of cognitive impairment at baseline [- 0.5381 
      (0.25), p = 0.0365] were associated with faster UHDRS-IV decline. In SCA3, higher 
      INAS counts were associated with a faster UHDRS-IV decline [- 0.05 (0.02), 
      p = 0.0212]. In SCA1, PHQ-9 progression was faster in patients with cognitive 
      impairment [0.14 (0.07); p = 0.0396]. CONCLUSIONS: In the common SCAs, PROMs give 
      complementary information to the information provided by neurological scales. 
      This underlines the importance of PROMs as additional outcome measures in future 
      interventional trials.

AB  - A skin biopsy of a patient with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3, also known 
      as Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)) caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      in the ATXN3 gene, was used to generate an induced pluripotent stem cell line, 
      HIHCNi002-A (iPSC-SCA3). Skin fibroblasts were reprogrammed using episomal 
      plasmids carrying hOCT4, hSOX2, hKLF4, hL-MYC, and hLIN28. The iPSC-SCA3 line 
      exhibits chromosomal stability with conservation of the ATXN3 repeat expansion, 
      expresses pluripotency markers and differentiates into endo-, meso-, and 
      ectodermal cells in vitro.

AB  - Although the main clinical manifestations of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) 
      result from damage of the cerebellum, other systems may also be involved. 
      Olfactory deficits have been reported in other types of ataxias, especially in 
      SCA3; however, there are no studies on olfactory deficits in SCA type 10 (SCA10). 
      To analyze olfactory function of SCA10 patients compared with that of SCA3, 
      Parkinson's, and healthy controls. Olfactory identification was tested in three 
      groups of 30 patients (SCA10, SCA3, and Parkinson's disease (PD)) and 44 healthy 
      controls using the Sniffin' Sticks (SS16) test. Mean SS16 score was 11.9 +/- 2.9 
      for the SCA10 group, 12.3 +/- 1.9 for the SCA3 group, 6.6 +/- 2.8 for the PD group, 
      and 12.1 +/- 2.0 for the control group. Mean SS16 score for the SCA10 group was not 
      significantly different from the scores for the SCA3 and control groups but was 
      significantly higher than the score for the PD group (p < 0.001) when adjusted 
      for age, gender, and history of smoking. There was no association between SS16 
      scores and disease duration in the SCA10 or SCA3 groups or number of repeat 
      expansions. SS16 and Mini Mental State Examination scores were correlated in the 
      three groups: SCA10 group (r = 0.59, p = 0.001), SCA3 group (r = 0.50, 
      p = 0.005), and control group (r = 0.40, p = 0.007). We found no significant 
      olfactory deficits in SCA10 in this large series.

TI  - Tissue-Specific Upregulation of Drosophila Insulin Receptor (InR) Mitigates 
      Poly(Q)-Mediated Neurotoxicity by Restoration of Cellular Transcription 
      Machinery.
PG  - 1310-1329

AB  - Polyglutamine [poly(Q)] disorders are a class of trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      neurodegenerative disorders which are dominantly inherited and progressively 
      acquired with age. This group of disorders entail the characteristic formation of 
      protein aggregates leading to widespread loss of neurons in different regions of 
      the brain. SCA3 and HD, the two most commonly occurring types of poly(Q) 
      disorders were examined in the present study. With the aim of elucidating novel 
      genetic modifiers of poly(Q) disorders, the Drosophila insulin receptor (InR) was 
      identified as a potential suppressor of poly(Q)-induced neurotoxicity and 
      degeneration. We demonstrate for the first time that targeted upregulation of InR 
      could effectively mitigate poly(Q)-mediated neurodegeneration in fly models. A 
      significant reduction in poly(Q)-mediated cellular stress and apoptosis was noted 
      upon InR overexpression in poly(Q) background. We further reveal that targeted 
      upregulation of InR causes a substantial reduction in poly(Q) aggregate formation 
      with the residual inclusion bodies localised to the cytoplasm. We also 
      demonstrate that InR achieves suppression of poly(Q) toxicity by replenishing the 
      cellular pool of CREB binding protein and improving the histone acetylation 
      status of the cell. This leads to restoration of the cellular transcriptional 
      machinery which is otherwise severely compromised in poly(Q) disease conditions. 
      Interestingly, there also appeared a possibility of autophagy-mediated rescue of 
      poly(Q) phenotype due to upregulation of InR. Therefore, our study strongly 
      suggests that modulation of the insulin signalling pathway could be an effective 
      therapeutic intervention against poly(Q) disorders.

AB  - OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) or spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3 (SCA3) is the most common type of autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA). Sleep disorders have been described as frequent non-motor symptoms in MJD, 
      and with marked impairment on quality of life. However, few studies have 
      evaluated the frequency and characteristics of sleep apnea in MJD. 
      PATIENTS/METHODS: This study analyzed the prevalence of sleep apnea in 47 
      patients with MJD by using polysomnography. Clinical variables such as age, age 
      at onset of symptoms, duration of symptoms (at time of evaluation), body index 
      mass, ataxia scales severity and CAG repeat length were compared with 
      polysomnographic findings. RESULTS: Thirty four percent of MJD patients had OSAS, 
      and 42.5% had excessive daytime somnolence. There were no differences considering 
      ataxia severity, CAG repetition length or other clinical variable. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Patients with MJD have high frequency of obstructive sleep apnea, and this sleep 
      disorder is not correlated with ataxia severity, CAG repetition length or other 
      clinical variable.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most common subtype of 
      SCAs worldwide. SCA3 homozygote is defined as expanded CAG repeats in both 
      alleles that might exhibit severe phenotype due to gene dosage effect. However, a 
      study on the systematic comparison of clinical phenotypes between homozygotes and 
      heterozygotes to indicate these verity of phenotypes of homozygotes is still 
      lacking. METHODS: A total of 14 SCA3 homozygotes (3 Chinese participants and 11 
      participants from various ethnicity in different published studies) and 143 
      Chinese heterozygotes of SCA3 were recruited for this study. The 95% confidence 
      intervals (CIs) of age at onset and disease severity expected from heterozygous 
      patients were analyzed to detect the phenotypic differences between homozygotes 
      and heterozygotes. RESULTS: Almost all the homozygotes (13 of 14) were found to 
      present a significant earlier age at onset compared with heterozygotes, because 
      age at onset of most homozygotes was lower than the 95% CIs of age at onset of 
      heterozygotes. Also, the clinical severity in most of the homozygotes (3 of 4) 
      with identified clinical phenotypes was higher than the 95% CIs of severity in 
      heterozygotes, indicating more severe clinical phenotypes in SCA3 homozygotes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The homozygosity for SCA3 could lead to an earlier age of onset and 
      putative severe clinical features. The findings of the present study suggested an 
      influence of gene dosage on SCA3 phenotypes.

TI  - Serum neurofilament light is increased in multiple system atrophy of cerebellar 
      type and in repeat-expansion spinocerebellar ataxias: a pilot study.
PG  - 1618-1624
LID - 10.1007/s00415-018-8893-9 [doi]
AB  - Blood biomarkers in degenerative ataxias are still largely missing. Here, we 
      aimed to provide piloting proof-of-concept that serum Neurofilament light (NfL) 
      could offer a promising peripheral blood biomarker in degenerative ataxias. 
      Specifically, as a marker of neuronal damage, NfL might (1) help to differentiate 
      multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type (MSA-C) from sporadic adult-onset 
      ataxia (SAOA), and (2) show increases in repeat-expansion spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs) which might be amenable to treatment in the future. To explore these two 
      hypotheses, we measured serum NfL levels by single-molecule array (Simoa) 
      technique in 115 subjects, comprising patients with MSA-C (n = 25), SAOA 
      (n = 25), the most frequent repeat-expansion SCAs (SCA 1, 2, 3 and 6) (n = 20), 
      and age-matched controls (n = 45). Compared to controls, NfL was significantly 
      increased in MSA-C, with levels significantly higher than in SAOA (AUC = 0.74 
      (0.59-0.89), mean and 95% confidence interval, p = .004). NfL was also 
      significantly increased in SCA patients as compared to controls (AUC = 0.91 
      (0.81-1.00), p < .001), including NfL increases in SCA1 and SCA3. These findings 
      provide first proof-of-concept that NfL might provide a promising peripheral 
      biomarker in degenerative ataxias, e.g. supporting the differentiation of MSA-C 
      from SAOA, and indicating neuronal damage in repeat-expansion SCAs.

TI  - Genetic testing for clinically suspected spinocerebellar ataxias: report from a 
      tertiary referral centre in India.
PG  - 219-224
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      syndromes, characterized by a wide range of muscular weakness and motor deficits, 
      caused due to cerebellar degeneration. The prevalence of the syndromes of SCA 
      varies across the world and is known to be linked to the instability of 
      trinucleotide repeats within the high-end normal alleles, along with susceptible 
      haplotype. We estimated sizes of the CAG or GAA repeat expansions at the SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA12 and frataxin loci among 864 referrals of subjects to genetic 
      counselling and testing (GCAT) clinic, National Institute of Mental Health and 
      Neurosciences, Bengaluru, India, with suspected SCA. The most frequent mutations 
      detected were SCA1 (n = 100 (11.6%)) and SCA2 (n = 98 (11.3%)) followed by SCA3 
      (n = 40 (4.6%)), FRDA (n = 20 (2.3%)) and SCA12 (n = 8 (0.9%)).

TI  - Survival in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, and 6 (EUROSCA): 
      a longitudinal cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias are dominantly inherited progressive ataxia 
      disorders that can lead to premature death. We aimed to study the overall 
      survival of patients with the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, and SCA6) and to identify the strongest contributing predictors that affect 
      survival. METHODS: In this longitudinal cohort study (EUROSCA), we enrolled men 
      and women, aged 18 years or older, from 17 ataxia referral centres in ten 
      European countries; participants had positive genetic test results for SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 and progressive, otherwise unexplained, ataxias. Survival was 
      defined as the time from enrolment to death for any reason. We used the Cox 
      regression model adjusted for age at baseline to analyse survival. We used 
      prognostic factors with a p value less than 0.05 from a multivariate model to 
      build nomograms and assessed their performance based on discrimination and 
      calibration. The EUROSCA study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
      NCT02440763. FINDINGS: Between July 1, 2005, and Aug 31, 2006, 525 patients with 
      SCA1 (n=117), SCA2 (n=162), SCA3 (n=139), or SCA6 (n=107) were enrolled and 
      followed up. The 10-year survival rate was 57% (95% CI 47-69) for SCA1, 74% 
      (67-81) for SCA2, 73% (65-82) for SCA3, and 87% (80-94) for SCA6. Factors 
      associated with shorter survival were: dysphagia (hazard ratio 4.52, 95% CI 
      1.83-11.15) and a higher value for the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of 
      Ataxia (SARA) score (1.26, 1.19-1.33) for patients with SCA1; older age at 
      inclusion (1.04, 1.01-1.08), longer CAG repeat length (1.16, 1.03-1.31), and 
      higher SARA score (1.15, 1.10-1.20) for patients with SCA2; older age at 
      inclusion (1.44, 1.20-1.74), dystonia (2.65, 1.21-5.53), higher SARA score (1.26, 
      1.17-1.35), and negative interaction between CAG and age at inclusion (0.994, 
      0.991-0.997) for patients with SCA3; and higher SARA score (1.17, 1.08-1.27) for 
      patients with SCA6. The nomogram-predicted probability of 10-year survival showed 
      good discrimination (c index 0.905 [SD 0.027] for SCA1, 0.822 [0.032] for SCA2, 
      0.891 [0.021] for SCA3, and 0.825 [0.054] for SCA6). INTERPRETATION: Our study 
      provides quantitative data on the survival of patients with the most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, based on a long follow-up period. These results have 
      implications for the design of future interventional studies of spinocerebellar 
      ataxias; for example, the prognostic survival nomogram could be useful for 
      selection and stratification of patients. Our findings need validation in an 
      external population before they can be used to counsel patients and their 
      families. FUNDING: European Union 6th Framework programme, German Ministry of

AB  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a complex and multifactorial neurodegenerative 
      disease, and its pathogenesis remains uncertain. Patients with MSA or 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) show overlapping clinical phenotypes. Previous 
      studies have reported that intermediate or long CAG expansions in SCA genes have 
      been associated with other neurodegenerative disease. In this study, we screened 
      for the number of CAG repeats in ATXN1, 2 and 3 in 200 patients with MSA and 314 
      healthy controls to evaluate possible associations between (CAG)(n) in these 
      three polyQ-related genes and MSA. Our findings indicated that longer repeat 
      lengths in ATXN2 were associated with increased risk for MSA in Chinese 
      individuals. No relationship was observed between CAG repeat length in the three 
      examined genes and age at onset (AO) of MSA.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the region of the ATXN3 gene. The 
      main feature of SCA3 is progressive ataxia, which affects balance, gait, and 
      speech. Urine cells (UCs) of a SCA3 patient were successfully translated to 
      induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by using the Sendai virus delivery system. 
      ZZUi004-A cell line may provide a robust platform for further study of SCA3 
      pathogenesis as well as drug testing and gene therapy research.

AB  - Cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansions in the coding regions of nine 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) genes (HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATN1, AR, 
      and TBP) are the cause of several neurodegenerative diseases including 
      Huntington's disease (HD), six different spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. The 
      expanded CAG repeat length in the causative gene is negatively related to the 
      age-at-onset (AAO) of clinical symptoms. In addition to the expanded CAG repeat 
      length in the causative gene, the normal CAG repeats in the other polyQ genes can 
      affect the AAO, suggesting functional interactions between the polyQ genes. 
      However, there is no detailed assessment of the relationships among polyQ genes 
      in pathologically relevant brain regions. We used gene co-expression analysis to 
      study the functional relationships among polyQ genes in different brain regions 
      using the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), a spatial map of gene expression in the 
      healthy brain. We constructed co-expression networks for seven anatomical brain 
      structures, as well as a region showing a specific pattern of atrophy in HD 
      patients detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. In this 
      HD-associated region, we found that ATN1 and ATXN2 were co-expressed and shared 
      co-expression partners which were enriched for DNA repair genes. We observed a 
      similar co-expression pattern in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and striatum in 
      which this relation was most pronounced. Given that the co-expression patterns 
      for these anatomical structures were similar to those for the HD-associated 
      region, our results suggest that their disruption is likely involved in HD 
      pathology. Moreover, ATN1 and ATXN2 also shared many co-expressed genes with HTT, 
      the causative gene of HD, across the brain. Although this triangular relationship 
      among these three polyQ genes may also be dysregulated in other polyQ diseases, 
      stronger co-expression patterns between ATN1 and ATXN2 observed in the 
      HD-associated region, especially in the striatum, may be more specific to HD.

TI  - Postural Tremor and Ataxia Progression in Spinocerebellar Ataxias.
PG  - 492

LID - 492
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postural tremor can sometimes occur in spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs). However, the prevalence and clinical characteristics of postural tremor 
      in SCAs are poorly understood, and whether SCA patients with postural tremor have 
      different ataxia progression is not known. METHODS: We studied postural tremor in 
      315 patients with SCA1, 2, 3, and 6 recruited from the Clinical Research 
      Consortium for Spinocerebellar Ataxias (CRC-SCA), which consists of 12 
      participating centers in the United States, and we evaluated ataxia progression 
      in these patients from January 2010 to August 2012. RESULTS: Among 315 SCA 
      patients, postural tremor was most common in SCA2 patients (SCA1, 5.8%; SCA2, 
      27.5%; SCA3, 12.4%; SCA6, 16.9%; p = 0.007). SCA3 patients with postural tremor 
      had longer CAG repeat expansions than SCA3 patients without postural tremor 
      (73.67 +/- 3.12 vs. 70.42 +/- 3.96, p = 0.003). Interestingly, SCA1 and SCA6 patients 
      with postural tremor had a slower rate of ataxia progression (SCA1, beta = -0.91, p 
      < 0.001; SCA6, beta = -1.28, p = 0.025), while SCA2 patients with postural tremor 
      had a faster rate of ataxia progression (beta = 1.54, p = 0.034). We also found that 
      the presence of postural tremor in SCA2 patients could be influenced by repeat 
      expansions of ATXN1 (beta = -1.53, p = 0.037) and ATXN3 (beta = 0.57, p = 0.018), 
      whereas postural tremor in SCA3 was associated with repeat lengths in TBP (beta = 
      0.63, p = 0.041) and PPP2R2B (beta = -0.40, p = 0.032). DISCUSSION: Postural tremor 
      could be a clinical feature of SCAs, and the presence of postural tremor could be 
      associated with different rates of ataxia progression. Genetic interactions 
      between ataxia genes might influence the brain circuitry and thus affect the 
      clinical presentation of postural tremor.

TI  - Comparison of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 mouse models identifies early 
      gain-of-function, cell-autonomous transcriptional changes in oligodendrocytes.
PG  - 3362-3374
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddx224 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. This expansion 
      leads to misfolding and aggregation of mutant ataxin-3 (ATXN3) and degeneration 
      of select brain regions. A key unanswered question in SCA3 and other 
      polyglutamine diseases is the extent to which neurodegeneration is mediated 
      through gain-of-function versus loss-of-function. To address this question in 
      SCA3, we performed transcriptional profiling on the brainstem, a highly 
      vulnerable brain region in SCA3, in a series of mouse models with varying degrees 
      of ATXN3 expression and aggregation. We include two SCA3 knock-in mouse models: 
      our previously published model that erroneously harbors a tandem duplicate of the 
      CAG repeat-containing exon, and a corrected model, introduced here. Both models 
      exhibit dose-dependent neuronal accumulation and aggregation of mutant ATXN3, but 
      do not exhibit a behavioral phenotype. We identified a molecular signature that 
      correlates with ATXN3 neuronal aggregation yet is primarily linked to 
      oligodendrocytes, highlighting early white matter dysfunction in SCA3. Two 
      robustly elevated oligodendrocyte transcripts, Acy3 and Tnfrsf13c, were confirmed 
      as elevated at the protein level in SCA3 human disease brainstem. To determine if 
      mutant ATXN3 acts on oligodendrocytes cell-autonomously, we manipulated the 
      repeat expansion in the variant SCA3 knock-in mouse by cell-type specific 
      Cre/LoxP recombination. Changes in oligodendrocyte transcripts are driven 
      cell-autonomously and occur independent of neuronal ATXN3 aggregation. Our 
      findings support a primary toxic gain of function mechanism and highlight a 
      previously unrecognized role for oligodendrocyte dysfunction in SCA3 disease 
      pathogenesis.

TI  - Genetic Screening for Spinocerebellar Ataxia Genes in a Japanese Single-Hospital 
      Cohort.
PG  - 116-122
LID - 10.14802/jmd.17011 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diagnosis of sporadic cerebellar ataxia is a challenge for 
      neurologists. A wide range of potential causes exist, including chronic alcohol 
      use, multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type (MSA-C), and sporadic late 
      cortical cerebellar atrophy. Recently, an autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) mutation was identified in a cohort of patients with non-MSA-C 
      sporadic cerebellar ataxia. The aim of this study is to genetically screen genes 
      involved in SCA in a Japanese single-hospital cohort. METHODS: Over an 8-year 
      period, 140 patients with cerebellar ataxia were observed. There were 109 
      patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia (no family history for at least four 
      generations, 73 patients with MSA-C, and 36 patients with non-MSA-C sporadic 
      cerebellar ataxia) and 31 patients with familial cerebellar ataxia. We performed 
      gene analysis comprising SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 17, 31, and 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) in 28 of 31 non-MSA-C sporadic 
      patients who requested the test. Familial patients served as a control. RESULTS: 
      Gene abnormalities were found in 57% of non-MSA-C sporadic cerebellar ataxia 
      cases. Among patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia, abnormalities in SCA6 were 
      the most common (36%), followed by abnormalities in SCA1 (7.1%), SCA2 (3.6%), 
      SCA3 (3.6%), SCA8 (3.6%), and DRPLA (3.6%). In contrast, gene abnormalities were 
      found in 75% of familial cerebellar ataxia cases, with abnormalities in SCA6 
      being the most common (29%). For sporadic versus familial cases for those with 
      SCA6 abnormalities, the age of onset was older (69 years vs. 59 years, 
      respectively), and CAG repeat length was shorter (23 vs. 25, respectively) in the 
      former than in the latter (not statistically significant). CONCLUSION: 
      Autosomal-dominant mutations in SCA genes, particularly in SCA6, are not rare in 
      sporadic cerebellar ataxia. The reason for the frequency of mutations in SCA6 
      remains unclear; however, the reason may reflect a higher age at onset and 
      variable penetrance of SCA6 mutations.

AB  - The most common dominantly inherited ataxia, spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 
      (SCA3), is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the ATXN3 gene that encodes an abnormally long polyglutamine tract 
      in the disease protein, ATXN3. Mice lacking ATXN3 are phenotypically normal; 
      hence, disease gene suppression offers a compelling approach to slow the 
      neurodegenerative cascade in SCA3. Here we tested antisense oligonucleotides 
      (ASOs) that target human ATXN3 in two complementary mouse models of SCA3: yeast 
      artificial chromosome (YAC) MJD-Q84.2 (Q84) mice expressing the full-length human 
      ATXN3 gene and cytomegalovirus (CMV) MJD-Q135 (Q135) mice expressing a human 
      ATXN3 cDNA. Intracerebroventricular injection of ASOs resulted in widespread 
      delivery to the most vulnerable brain regions in SCA3. In treated Q84 mice, three 
      of five tested ASOs reduced disease protein levels by >50% in the diencephalon, 
      cerebellum, and cervical spinal cord. Two ASOs also significantly reduced mutant 
      ATXN3 in the mouse forebrain and resulted in no signs of astrogliosis or 
      microgliosis. In Q135 mice expressing a single ATXN3 isoform via a cDNA 
      transgene, ASOs did not result in similar robust ATXN3 silencing. Our results 
      indicate that ASOs targeting full-length human ATXN3 would likely be well 
      tolerated and could lead to a preventative therapy for SCA3.

TI  - Large normal-range TBP and ATXN7 CAG repeat lengths are associated with increased 
      lifetime risk of depression.
PG  - e1143
LID - 10.1038/tp.2017.116 [doi]
AB  - Depression is one of the most prevalent and debilitating psychiatric disorders 
      worldwide. Recently, we showed that both relatively short and relatively long 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in the huntingtin gene (HTT) are 
      associated with an increased risk of lifetime depression. However, to what extent 
      the variations in CAG repeat length in the other eight polyglutamine 
      disease-associated genes (PDAGs) are associated with depression is still unknown. 
      We determined the CAG repeat sizes of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, 
      ATN1 and AR in two well-characterized Dutch cohorts-the Netherlands Study of 
      Depression and Anxiety and the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older 
      Persons-including 2165 depressed and 1058 non-depressed individuals-aged 18-93 
      years. The association between PDAG CAG repeat size and the risk for depression 
      was assessed via binary logistic regression. We found that the odds ratio (OR) 
      for lifetime depression was significantly higher for individuals with >10, 
      compared with subjects with </=10, CAG repeats in both ATXN7 alleles (OR=1.90, 
      confidence interval (CI) 1.26-2.85). For TBP we found a similar association: A 
      CAG repeat length exceeding the median in both alleles was associated with an 
      increased risk for lifetime depression (OR=1.33, CI 1.00-1.76). In conclusion, we 
      observed that carriers of either ATXN7 or TBP alleles with relatively large CAG 
      repeat sizes in both alleles had a substantially increased risk of lifetime 
      depression. Our findings provide critical evidence for the notion that repeat 
      polymorphisms can act as complex genetic modifiers of depression.

TI  - A panel study on patients with dominant cerebellar ataxia highlights the 
      frequency of channelopathies.
PG  - 1579-1594
LID - 10.1093/brain/awx081 [doi]
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias have a marked heterogeneous genetic 
      background, with mutations in 34 genes identified so far. This large amount of 
      implicated genes accounts for heterogeneous clinical presentations, making 
      genotype-phenotype correlations a major challenge in the field. While 
      polyglutamine ataxias, linked to CAG repeat expansions in genes such as ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, CACNA1A and TBP, have been extensively characterized in 
      large cohorts, there is a need for comprehensive assessment of frequency and 
      phenotype of more 'conventional' ataxias. After exclusion of CAG/polyglutamine 
      expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia genes in 412 index cases with dominantly 
      inherited cerebellar ataxias, we aimed to establish the relative frequencies of 
      mutations in other genes, with an approach combining panel sequencing and TaqMan(R) 
      polymerase chain reaction assay. We found relevant genetic variants in 59 
      patients (14.3%). The most frequently mutated were channel genes [CACNA1A (n = 
      16), KCND3 (n = 4), KCNC3 (n = 2) and KCNA1 (n = 2)]. Deletions in ITPR1 (n = 11) 
      were followed by biallelic variants in SPG7 (n = 9). Variants in AFG3L2 (n = 7) 
      came next in frequency, and variants were rarely found in STBN2 (n = 2), ELOVL5, 
      FGF14, STUB1 and TTBK2 (n = 1 each). Interestingly, possible risk factor variants 
      were detected in SPG7 and POLG. Clinical comparisons showed that ataxias due to 
      channelopathies had a significantly earlier age at onset with an average of 24.6 
      years, versus 40.9 years for polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias and 
      37.8 years for SPG7-related forms (P = 0.001). In contrast, disease duration was 
      significantly longer in the former (20.5 years versus 9.3 and 13.7, P=0.001), 
      though for similar functional stages, indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. Of interest, intellectual deficiency was more frequent in channel 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, while cognitive impairment in adulthood was similar 
      among the three groups. Similar differences were found among a single gene group, 
      comparing 23 patients with CACNA1A expansions (spinocerebellar ataxia 6) to 22 
      patients with CACNA1A point mutations, which had lower average age at onset (25.2 
      versus 47.3 years) with longer disease duration (18.7 versus 10.9), but lower 
      severity indexes (0.39 versus 0.44), indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. In conclusion, we identified relevant genetic variations in up to 15% of 
      cases after exclusion of polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias, and 
      confirmed CACNA1A and SPG7 as major ataxia genes. We could delineate firm 
      genotype-phenotype correlations that are important for genetic counselling and of 
      possible prognostic value.

LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddx039 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the deubiquitinase ataxin-3 causes 
      neurodegeneration in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3), one of nine inherited, 
      incurable diseases caused by similar mutations. Ataxin-3's degradation is 
      inhibited by its binding to the proteasome shuttle Rad23 through 
      ubiquitin-binding site 2 (UbS2). Disrupting this interaction decreases levels of 
      ataxin-3. Since reducing levels of polyQ proteins can decrease their toxicity, we 
      tested whether genetically modulating the ataxin-3-Rad23 interaction regulates 
      its toxicity in Drosophila. We found that exogenous Rad23 increases the toxicity 
      of pathogenic ataxin-3, coincident with increased levels of the disease protein. 
      Conversely, reducing Rad23 levels alleviates toxicity in this SCA3 model. 
      Unexpectedly, pathogenic ataxin-3 with a mutated Rad23-binding site at UbS2, 
      despite being present at markedly lower levels, proved to be more pathogenic than 
      a disease-causing counterpart with intact UbS2. Additional studies established 
      that the increased toxicity upon mutating UbS2 stems from disrupting the 
      autoprotective role that pathogenic ataxin-3 has against itself, which depends on 
      the co-chaperone, DnaJ-1. Our data reveal a previously unrecognized balance 
      between pathogenic and potentially therapeutic properties of the ataxin-3-Rad23 
      interaction; they highlight this interaction as critical for the toxicity of the 
      SCA3 protein, and emphasize the importance of considering protein context when 
      pursuing suppressive avenues.

AB  - Ubiquitination and phosphorylation of proteins represent post translational 
      modifications (PTMs) capable of regulating a variety of cellular processes. In 
      the neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), the disease 
      causing protein ataxin-3 carries an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch 
      causing it to aggregate in nuclear inclusions. These inclusions are decorated 
      with ubiquitin suggestive of a malfunction in the clearance of the mutant 
      protein. Differences in ubiquitin chain topology between normal and polyQ 
      expanded ataxin-3 could be involved in the differential clearance of the two 
      proteins and play a role in SCA3 pathogenesis. Likewise, changes in 
      phosphorylation patterns between the two variants could contribute to pathogenic 
      processes involved in SCA3. We therefore determined the ubiquitination and 
      phosphorylation patterns, together with the ubiquitin-linkage types associated 
      with normal and polyQ expanded ataxin-3 by mass spectrometry (MS). This analysis 
      revealed a similar ubiquitin linkage pattern on normal and expanded ataxin-3. 
      However, the distribution of ubiquitinated lysine residues was altered in polyQ 
      expanded ataxin-3, with increased ubiquitination at the new identified 
      ubiquitination site lysine-8. MS analysis of phosphorylation also revealed novel 
      phosphorylation sites in ataxin-3, and an increase in phosphorylation of expanded 
      ataxin-3 at several positions. The study suggests that differences in clearance 
      of normal and expanded ataxin-3 are not attributed to differences in 
      ubiquitin-linkage pattern. However, the observed differences between the normal 
      and polyQ expanded ataxin-3 with respect to the degree of ubiquitination and 
      phosphorylation on specific sites may have an impact on ataxin-3 function and 
      SCA3 pathogenesis.

PG  - 97-105
AB  - This cross-sectional study investigated the correlation between the CAG repeat 
      length and the degeneration of cerebellum in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) 
      patients based on neuroimaging approaches. Forty SCA3 patients were recruited and 
      classified into two subgroups according to their CAG repeat lengths (>/= 74 and 
      < 74). We measured each patient's Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia 
      (SARA) score, N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) ratios based on magnetic 
      resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and 3-dimensional fractal dimension (3D-FD) values 
      derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results. Furthermore, the 3D-FD 
      values were used to construct structural covariance networks based on graph 
      theoretical analysis. The results revealed that SCA3 patients with a longer CAG 
      repeat length demonstrated earlier disease onset. However, the CAG repeat length 
      did not significantly correlate with their SARA scores, cerebellar NAA/Cr ratios 
      or cerebellar 3D-FD values. Network dissociation between cerebellar regions and 
      parietal-occipital regions was found in SCA3 patients with CAG >/= 74, but not in 
      those with CAG < 74. In conclusion, the CAG repeat length is uncorrelated with 
      the change of SARA score, cerebellar function and cerebellar structure in SCA3. 
      Nevertheless, a longer CAG repeat length may indicate early structural covariance 
      network dissociation.

TI  - Compound heterozygous intermediate MJD alleles cause cerebellar ataxia with 
      sensory neuropathy.
PG  - e123
LID - e123
AB  - Spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) is a group of disorders characterized by 
      progressive ataxia caused by dysfunction and atrophy of the cerebellum or its 
      projections. Approximately one-third of SCD cases are familial SCD, the majority 
      of which are attributed to CAG triplet repeat expansions including 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, and dentate-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      triplet repeat number of the alleles representing complete penetrance varies 
      among diseases. Generally, there is a gap between the normal alleles and the 
      complete penetrance alleles. Rarely, intermediate alleles with the repeat numbers 
      between the abnormal and normal ranges are observed, although the implications of 
      these intermediate alleles remain ambiguous.

TI  - The Initial Symptom and Motor Progression in Spinocerebellar Ataxias.
PG  - 615-622
LID - 10.1007/s12311-016-0836-3 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study is to determine whether the initial symptom associates with 
      motor progression in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). SCAs are clinically 
      heterogeneous and the initial presentation may represent different subtypes of 
      SCA with different motor progression. We studied 317 participants with SCAs1, 2, 
      3, and 6 from the Clinical Research Consortium for SCAs (CRC-SCA) and repeatedly 
      measured the severity of ataxia for 2 years. SCA patients were divided into 
      gait-onset and non-gait-onset (speech, vision, and hand dexterity) groups based 
      on the initial presentation. In addition to demographic comparison, we employed 
      regression models to study ataxia progression in these two groups after adjusting 
      for age, sex, and pathological CAG repeats. The majority of SCA patients had gait 
      abnormality as an initial presentation. The pathological CAG repeat expansions 
      were similar between the gait-onset and non-gait-onset groups. In SCA1, 
      gait-onset group progressed slower than non-gait-onset group, while gait-onset 
      SCA6 group progressed faster than their counterpart. In addition, the disease 
      presented 9 years later for SCA2 gait-onset group than non-gait-onset group. 
      Initial symptoms of SCA3 did not influence age of onset or disease progression. 
      The initial symptom in each SCA has a different influence on age of onset and 
      motor progression. Therefore, gait and non-gait-onset groups of SCAs might 
      represent different subtypes of the diseases.

TI  - Autophagy Promoted the Degradation of Mutant ATXN3 in Neurally Differentiated 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia-3 Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.
PG  - 6701793
LID - 6701793
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia-3 (SCA3) is the most common dominant inherited ataxia 
      worldwide and is caused by an unstable CAG trinucleotide expansion mutation 
      within the ATXN3 gene, resulting in an expanded polyglutamine tract within the 
      ATXN3 protein. Many in vitro studies have examined the role of autophagy in 
      neurodegenerative disorders, including SCA3, using transfection models with 
      expression of pathogenic proteins in normal cells. In the current study, we aimed 
      to develop an improved model for studying SCA3 in vitro using patient-derived 
      cells. The patient-derived iPS cells presented a phenotype similar to that of 
      human embryonic stem cells and could be differentiated into neurons. 
      Additionally, these cells expressed abnormal ATXN3 protein without changes in the 
      CAG repeat length during culture for at least 35 passages as iPS cells, up to 3 
      passages as neural stem cells, and after 4 weeks of neural differentiation. 
      Furthermore, we demonstrated that neural differentiation in these iPS cells was 
      accompanied by autophagy and that rapamycin promoted autophagy through 
      degradation of mutant ATXN3 proteins in neurally differentiated spinocerebellar 
      ataxia-3 human induced pluripotent stem cells (p < 0.05). In conclusion, 
      patient-derived iPS cells are a good model for studying the mechanisms of SCA3 
      and may provide a tool for drug discovery in vitro.

AB  - The neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is caused by a 
      CAG-repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene. In this study, induced pluripotent stem 
      cell (iPSC) lines were established from two SCA3 patients. Dermal fibroblasts 
      were reprogrammed using an integration-free method and the resulting SCA3 iPSCs 
      were differentiated into neurons. These neuronal lines harbored the disease 
      causing mutation, expressed comparable levels of several neuronal markers and 
      responded to the neurotransmitters, glutamate/glycine, GABA and acetylcholine. 
      Additionally, all neuronal cultures formed networks displaying synchronized 
      spontaneous calcium oscillations within 28days of maturation, and expressed the 
      mature neuronal markers NeuN and Synapsin 1 implying a relatively advanced state 
      of maturity, although not comparable to that of the adult human brain. 
      Interestingly, we were not able to recapitulate the glutamate-induced ataxin-3 
      aggregation shown in a previously published iPSC-derived SCA3 model. In 
      conclusion, we have generated a panel of SCA3 patient iPSCs and a robust protocol 
      to derive neurons of relatively advanced maturity, which could potentially be 
      valuable for the study of SCA3 disease mechanisms.

AB  - Expansion of CAG repeats, which code for the disease-causing polyglutamine 
      protein, is a common feature in polyglutamine diseases. RNA-mediated mechanisms 
      that contribute to neuropathology in polyglutamine diseases are important. 
      RNA-toxicity describes a phenomenon by which the mutant CAG repeat RNA recruits 
      RNA-binding proteins, thereby leading to aberrant function. For example the MID1 
      protein binds to mutant huntingtin (HTT) RNA, which is linked to Huntington's 
      disease (HD), at its CAG repeat region and induces protein synthesis of mutant 
      protein. But is this mechanism specific to HD or is it a common mechanism in CAG 
      repeat expansion disorders? To answer this question, we have analyzed the 
      interaction between MID1 and three other CAG repeat mRNAs, Ataxin2 (ATXN2), 
      Ataxin3 (ATXN3), and Ataxin7 (ATXN7), that all differ in the sequence flanking 
      the CAG repeat. We show that ATXN2, ATXN3, and ATXN7 bind to MID1 in a CAG repeat 
      length-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that functionally, in line with 
      what we have previously observed for HTT, the binding of MID1 to ATXN2, ATXN3, 
      and ATXN7 mRNA induces protein synthesis in a repeat length-dependent manner. Our 
      data suggest that regulation of protein translation by the MID1 complex is a 
      common mechanism for CAG repeat containing mRNAs.

      proteolytic cleavage of ataxin-3.

LID - 35200
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 (SCA3) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a 
      polyglutamine repeat expansion in the ataxin-3 protein. Cleavage of mutant 
      ataxin-3 by proteolytic enzymes yields ataxin-3 fragments containing the 
      polyglutamine stretch. These shorter ataxin-3 fragments are thought to be 
      involved in SCA3 pathogenesis due to their increased cellular toxicity and their 
      involvement in formation of the characteristic neuronal aggregates. As a strategy 
      to prevent formation of toxic cleavage fragments, we investigated an antisense 
      oligonucleotide-mediated modification of the ataxin-3 pre-mRNA through exon 
      skipping of exon 8 and 9, resulting in the removal of a central 88 amino acid 
      region of the ataxin-3 protein. This removed protein region contains several 
      predicted cleavage sites and two ubiquitin-interacting motifs. In contrast to 
      unmodified mutant ataxin-3, the internally truncated ataxin-3 protein did not 
      give rise to potentially toxic cleavage fragments when incubated with caspases. 
      In vitro experiments did not show cellular toxicity of the modified ataxin-3 
      protein. However, the modified protein was incapable of binding poly-ubiquitin 
      chains, which may interfere with its normal deubiquitinating function. Low exon 
      skipping efficiencies combined with reduction in important ataxin-3 protein 
      functions suggest that skipping of exon 8 and 9 is not a viable therapeutic 
      option for SCA3.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a rare inherited autosomal dominant 
      progressive neurological disorder, which results from a CAG...repeat expansion in 
      the gene encoding the deubiquitinating enzyme, ataxin...3. At present, no effective 
      treatment is available for this fatal disorder; however, certain studies have 
      suggested that reducing the levels of mutant ataxin...3 protein may reverse or halt 
      the progression of disease in patients with SCA3. In the present study, clinical 
      examinations were performed on a patient with SCA3 who exhibited disease features 
      including coughing, expectoration and was bedridden with mobility limitation. CAG 
      repetitions at SCA...associated genes were detected in the patient's family by 
      performing standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and triple...repeat primed PCR. 
      The numbers of CAG...repeats within the two alleles of the gene of interest in the 
      patient were 15 and 78. Notably, the patient's brother, who harbored 
      76 CAG...repeats in one allele of the gene of interest, did not exhibit severe 
      disease symptoms. These results suggest that the number of CAG...repeats is a 
      critical for determination of SCA3 disease severity and time of onset. In 
      addition, the de fi ned phenotypic characteristics of the patient in the present 
      study provide useful insight for more accurate clinical diagnosis and genotyping 
      of future patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The natural history of clinical symptoms in the spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCA)s has been well characterised. However there is little longitudinal 
      data comparing cognitive changes in the most common SCA subtypes over time. The 
      present study provides a preliminary longitudinal characterisation of the 
      clinical and cognitive profiles in patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7, 
      with the aim of elucidating the role of the cerebellum in cognition. METHODS: 13 
      patients with different SCAs all caused by CAG repeat expansion (SCA1, n = 2; 
      SCA2, n = 2; SCA3, n = 2; SCA6, n = 4; and SCA7, n = 3) completed a comprehensive 
      battery of cognitive and mood assessments at two time points, a mean of 
      7.35 years apart. All patients were evaluated clinically using the Scale for the 
      Rating and Assessment of Ataxia (SARA) and the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs 
      (INAS). Patients underwent structural MRI imaging at follow-up. RESULTS: Clinical 
      scale scores increased in all patients over time, most prominently in the SCA1 
      (SARA) and SCA3 (INAS) groups. New impairments on neuropsychological tests were 
      most commonly observed with executive functions, speed, attention, visual memory 
      and Theory of Mind. Results suggest possible differences in cognitive decline in 
      SCA subtypes, with the most rapid cognitive decline observed in the SCA1 
      patients, and the least in the SCA6 patients, congruent with observed patterns of 
      motor deterioration. Minimal changes in mood were observed, and MRI measures of 
      atrophy did not correlate with cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: As well as 
      increasing physical impairment, cognitive decline over time appears to be a 
      distinct aspect of the SCA phenotype, in keeping with the cerebellar 
      cognitive-affective syndrome. Our data suggest a trend of cognitive decline that 
      is different for each SCA subtype, and for the majority is related to the 
      severity of cerebellar motor impairment.

AB  - RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a widely used technique for 
      detecting transcripts in fixed cells and tissues. Many variants of RNA FISH have 
      been proposed to increase signal strength, resolution and target specificity. The 
      current variants of this technique facilitate the detection of the subcellular 
      localization of transcripts at a single molecule level. Among the applications of 
      RNA FISH are studies on nuclear RNA foci in diseases resulting from the expansion 
      of tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide repeats present in different single 
      genes. The partial or complete retention of mutant transcripts forming RNA 
      aggregates within the nucleoplasm has been shown in multiple cellular disease 
      models and in the tissues of patients affected with these atypical mutations. 
      Relevant diseases include, among others, myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) with CUG 
      repeats, Huntington's disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) with 
      CAG repeats, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) with CGG 
      repeats, myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) with CCUG repeats, amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD) with GGGGCC repeats and 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 32 (SCA32) with GGCCUG. In this article, we summarize 
      the results obtained with FISH to examine RNA nuclear inclusions. We provide a 
      detailed protocol for detecting RNAs containing expanded CAG and CUG repeats in 
      different cellular models, including fibroblasts, lymphoblasts, induced 
      pluripotent stem cells and murine and human neuronal progenitors. We also present 
      the results of the first single-molecule FISH application in a cellular model of 
      polyglutamine disease.

AB  - A major pathological hallmark in several neurodegenerative disorders, like 
      polyglutamine disorders (polyQ), including Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), is the 
      formation of protein aggregates. MJD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the 
      ATXN3 gene, resulting in an abnormal protein, which is prone to misfolding and 
      forms cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates within neurons, ultimately inducing 
      neurodegeneration. Treatment of proteinopathies with drugs that up-regulate 
      autophagy has shown promising results in models of polyQ diseases. Temsirolimus 
      (CCI-779) inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (m-TOR), while lithium 
      chloride (LiCl) acts by inhibiting inositol monophosphatase, both being able to 
      induce autophagy. We have previously shown that chronic treatment with LiCl (10.4 
      mg/kg) had limited effects in a transgenic MJD mouse model. Also, others have 
      shown that CCI-779 had mild positive effects in a different mouse model of the 
      disease. It has been suggested that the combination of mTOR-dependent and 
      -independent autophagy inducers could be a more effective therapeutic approach. 
      To further explore this avenue toward therapy, we treated CMVMJD135 transgenic 
      mice with a conjugation of CCI-779 and LiCl, both at concentrations known to 
      induce autophagy and not to be toxic. Surprisingly, this combined treatment 
      proved to be deleterious to both wild-type (wt) and transgenic animals, failing 
      to rescue their neurological symptoms and actually exerting neurotoxic effects. 
      These results highlight the possible dangers of manipulating autophagy in the 
      nervous system and suggest that a better understanding of the potential 
      disruption in the autophagy pathway in MJD is required before successful 
      long-term autophagy modulating therapies can be developed.

AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease, caused by 
      a CAG repeat expansion within the coding region of ATXN3 gene, and which 
      currently lacks effective treatment. In this work we tested the therapeutic 
      efficacy of chronic treatment with valproic acid (VPA) (200mg/kg), a compound 
      with known neuroprotection activity, and previously shown to be effective in 
      cell, fly and nematode models of MJD. We show that chronic VPA treatment in the 
      CMVMJD135 mouse model had limited effects in the motor deficits of these mice, 
      seen mostly at late stages in the motor swimming, beam walk, rotarod and 
      spontaneous locomotor activity tests, and did not modify the ATXN3 inclusion load 
      and astrogliosis in affected brain regions. However, VPA chronic treatment was 
      able to increase GRP78 protein levels at 30 weeks of age, one of its known 
      neuroprotective effects, confirming target engagement. In spite of limited 
      results, the use of another dosage of VPA or of VPA in a combined therapy with 
      molecules targeting other pathways, cannot be excluded as potential strategies 
      for MJD therapeutics.

TI  - Overexpression of Cystathionine gamma-Lyase Suppresses Detrimental Effects of 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3.
PG  - 758-768
LID - 10.2119/molmed.2015.00221 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a polyglutamine (polyQ) disorder caused 
      by a CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin-3 (ATXN3) gene resulting in toxic protein 
      aggregation. Inflammation and oxidative stress are considered secondary factors 
      contributing to the progression of this neurodegenerative disease. There is no 
      cure that halts or reverses the progressive neurodegeneration of SCA3. Here we 
      show that overexpression of cystathionine gamma-lyase, a central enzyme in cysteine 
      metabolism, is protective in a Drosophila model for SCA3. SCA3 flies show eye 
      degeneration, increased oxidative stress, insoluble protein aggregates, reduced 
      levels of protein persulfidation and increased activation of the innate immune 
      response. Overexpression of Drosophila cystathionine gamma-lyase restores protein 
      persulfidation, decreases oxidative stress, dampens the immune response and 
      improves SCA3-associated tissue degeneration. Levels of insoluble protein 
      aggregates are not altered; therefore, the data implicate a modifying role of 
      cystathionine gamma-lyase in ameliorating the downstream consequence of protein 
      aggregation leading to protection against SCA3-induced tissue degeneration. The 
      cystathionine gamma-lyase expression is decreased in affected brain tissue of SCA3 
      patients, suggesting that enhancers of cystathionine gamma-lyase expression or 
      activity are attractive candidates for future therapies.

TI  - Long-term disease progression in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, and 6: a 
      longitudinal cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias are dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      diseases. As potential treatments for these diseases are being developed, precise 
      knowledge of their natural history is needed. We aimed to study the long-term 
      disease progression of the most common spinocerebellar ataxias: SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, 
      and SCA6. Furthermore, we aimed to establish the order and occurrence of 
      non-ataxia symptoms, and identify predictors of disease progression. METHODS: In 
      this longitudinal cohort study (EUROSCA), we enrolled men and women with positive 
      genetic testing for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 and with progressive, otherwise 
      unexplained ataxia who were aged 18 years or older from 17 ataxia referral 
      centres in ten European countries. Patients were seen every year for 3 years, and 
      at irregular intervals thereafter. The primary outcome was the scale for the 
      assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA), and the inventory of non-ataxia signs 
      (INAS). We used linear mixed models to analyse progression. To account for 
      dropouts, we applied a pattern-mixture model. This study is registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02440763. FINDINGS: Between July 1, 2005, and Aug 
      31, 2006, 526 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 were enrolled. We analysed 
      data for 462 patients with at least one follow-up visit. Median observation time 
      was 49 months (IQR 35-72). SARA progression data were best fitted with a linear 
      model in all genotypes. Annual SARA score increase was 2.11 (SE 0.12) in patients 
      with SCA1, 1.49 (0.07) in patients with SCA2, 1.56 (0.08) in patients with SCA3, 
      and 0.80 (0.09) in patients with SCA6. The increase of the number of non-ataxia 
      signs reached a plateau in SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3. In patients with SCA6, the 
      number of non-ataxia symptoms increased linearly, but more slowly than in 
      patients with SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 (p<0.0001). Factors that were associated with 
      faster progression of the SARA score were short duration of follow-up (p=0.0179), 
      older age at inclusion (0.04 [SE 0.02] per additional year; p=0.0476), and longer 
      repeat expansions (0.06 [SE 0.02] per additional repeat unit; p=0.0128) in SCA1, 
      short duration of follow-up (p<0.0001), lower age at onset (-0.02 [SE 0.01] per 
      additional year; p=0.0014), and lower baseline SARA score (-0.02 [SE 0.01] per 
      additional SARA point; p=0.0083) in SCA2, and lower baseline SARA score (-0.03 
      [SE 0.01] per additional SARA point; p=0.0195) in SCA6. In SCA3, we did not 
      identify factors that affected progression of the SARA score. INTERPRETATION: Our 
      study provides quantitative data on the progression of the most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxias based on a follow-up period that exceeds those of 
      previous studies. Our data could prove useful for sample size calculation and 
      patient stratification in interventional trials. FUNDING: EU FP6 (EUROSCA),

AB  - BACKGROUND: About 50 % of Thai patients with adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) was Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6. The author 
      investigated further on less common SCAs in the patients without any known 
      mutations. METHODS: DNA samples of 82 index patients who were genetically 
      excluded MJD, SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) were examined. Analysis of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, SCA17 and SCA19 genes were 
      comprehensively performed. Normal range of trinucleotide repeat expansion sizes 
      of TATA-box-binding protein gene (TBP) were also determined in 374 control 
      subjects. RESULTS: Eight patients carried >/=42 CAG/CAA repeat allele in the TBP 
      consistent with SCA17. The pathological repeat alleles ranged from 42 to 57 
      repeats. All patients had significant degree of cognitive dysfunction. Other 
      non-ataxic phenotypes comprised of parkinsonism, chorea, dystonia and myoclonus. 
      A sporadic patient carried a heterozygous 41-repeat allele developed chronic 
      progressive cerebellar degeneration commenced at the age of 28 years. Whilst, 2 % 
      of the control subjects (8/374) carried the 41-repeat allele. Five of the 
      carriers were re-examined, and revealed that four of them had parkinsonism and/or 
      cognitive impairment without cerebellar signs. Analysis of other types of SCAs 
      was all negative. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA17 and SCA19 in Thais. SCA17 appears to be an important cause of ataxia in 
      Thailand. Although, the pathological cut-off point of the TBP repeat allele 
      remains unclear, the finding suggests that the 41-repeat may be a pathological 
      allele resulting late-onset or mild phenotype. Apart from ataxia, cognitive 
      impairment and parkinsonism may be clinical presentations in these carriers.

      dominantly inherited cerebellar ataxias which are caused by CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat expansions in the coding regions of the disease-specific genes. Although 
      previous post-mortem studies repeatedly revealed a consistent neurodegeneration 
      of the dopaminergic substantia nigra in patients with SCA2 and with SCA3, 
      parkinsonian motor features evolve only rarely. As the pathophysiological 
      mechanism how SCA2 and SCA3 patients do not exhibit parkinsonism is still 
      enigmatic, we performed a positron emission tomography and a post-mortem study of 
      two independent cohorts of SCA2 and SCA3 patients with and without parkinsonian 
      features. Positron emission tomography revealed a significant reduction of 
      dopamine transporter levels in the striatum as well as largely unaffected 
      postsynaptic striatal D2 receptors. In spite of this remarkable pathology in the 
      motor mesostriatal pathway, only 4 of 19 SCA2 and SCA3 patients suffered from 
      parkinsonism. The post-mortem investigation revealed, in addition to an extensive 
      neuronal loss in the dopaminergic substantia nigra of all patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia, a consistent affection of the thalamic ventral anterior 
      and ventral lateral nuclei, the pallidum and the cholinergic pedunculopontine 
      nucleus. With the exception of a single patient with SCA3 who suffered from 
      parkinsonian motor features during his lifetime, the subthalamic nucleus 
      underwent severe neuronal loss, which was clearly more severe in its motor 
      territory than in its limbic or associative territories. Our observation that 
      lesions of the motor territory of the subthalamic nucleus were consistently 
      associated with the prevention of parkinsonism in our SCA2 and SCA3 patients 
      matches the clinical experience that selective targeting of the motor territory 
      of the subthalamic nucleus by focal lesions or deep brain stimulation can 
      ameliorate parkinsonian motor features and is likely to counteract the 
      manifestation of parkinsonism in SCA2 and SCA3 despite a severe neurodegeneration 
      of the dopaminergic substantia nigra.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aim to clarify the pathogenic role of intermediate size repeat 
      expansions of SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 as risk factors for idiopathic 
      Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: We invited researchers from the Genetic 
      Epidemiology of Parkinson's Disease Consortium to participate in the study. There 
      were 12,346 cases and 8,164 controls genotyped, for a total of 4 repeats within 
      the SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 genes. Fixed- and random-effects models were used 
      to estimate the summary risk estimates for the genes. We investigated 
      between-study heterogeneity and heterogeneity between different ethnic 
      populations. RESULTS: We did not observe any definite pathogenic repeat 
      expansions for SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 genes in patients with idiopathic PD 
      from Caucasian and Asian populations. Furthermore, overall analysis did not 
      reveal any significant association between intermediate repeats and PD. The 
      effect estimates (odds ratio) ranged from 0.93 to 1.01 in the overall cohort for 
      the SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 loci. CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not support a 
      major role for definite pathogenic repeat expansions in SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and 
      SCA17 genes for idiopathic PD. Thus, results of this large study do not support 
      diagnostic screening of SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 gene repeats in the common 
      idiopathic form of PD. Likewise, this largest multicentered study performed to 
      date excludes the role of intermediate repeats of these genes as a risk factor 
      for PD.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the potential effect of six previously reported candidate 
      single nucleotide polymorphisms on age at onset (AAO) among Chinese patients with 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). METHODS: Three hundred and twenty-four unrelated 
      molecular-confirmed MJD patients were recruited between January 2006 and December 
      2014. The screening of candidate polymorphisms was first performed in 173 
      subjects using the SNaPshot((R)) Multiplex System. The mitochondrial NADH 
      dehydrogenase subunit 3 (MT-ND3) polymorphism 10398A>G (rs2853826) was further 
      verified with Sanger sequencing in additional 151 patients. RESULTS: An inverse 
      correlation was found between expanded CAG repeat length and AAO. The expanded 
      CAG repeat length can explain 63% of AAO variance. The 10398A polymorphism was 
      significantly associated with a 3-year earlier AAO in male patients with MJD (P = 
      0.001). Stepwise multiple regressions revealed that the 10398A polymorphism could 
      account for nearly 2% of AAO variance in male patients. CONCLUSION: Six candidate 
      SNPs have been screened in Chinese patients with MJD. A remarkable earlier AAO 
      was noted in male Chinese MJD patients with MT-ND3 gene 10398A polymorphism.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also called Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), 
      is one of the most common SCAs worldwide and caused by a CAG repeat expansion 
      located in ATXN3 gene. Based on the CAG repeat numbers, alleles of ATXN3 can be 
      divided into normal alleles (ANs), intermediate alleles (AIs) and expanded 
      alleles (AEs). It was controversial whether the frequency of large normal alleles 
      (large ANs) is related to the prevalence of SCA3 or not. And there were huge 
      chaos in the comprehension of the specific numbers of the range of CAG repeats 
      which is fundamental for genetic analysis of SCA3. To illustrate these issues, we 
      made a novel CAG repeat ladder to detect CAG repeats of ATXN3 in 1003 unrelated 
      Chinese normal individuals and studied haplotypes defined by three single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) closed to ATXN3. We found that the number of CAG 
      repeats ranged from 13 to 49, among them, 14 was the most common number. Positive 
      skew, the highest frequency of large ANs and 4 AIs which had never been reported 
      before were found. Also, AEs and large ANs shared the same haplotypes defined by 
      the SNPs. Based on these data and other related studies, we presumed that de novo 
      mutations of ATXN3 emerging from large ANs are at least one survival mechanisms 
      of mutational ATXN3 and we can redefine the range of CAG repeats as: ANs</=44, 45 
      </=AIs </=49 and AEs>/=50.

AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders are a heterogeneous group of chronic progressive 
      diseases and have pathological mechanisms in common. A certain causative gene 
      identified for a particular disease may be found to play roles in more than one 
      neurodegenerative disorder. We analyzed the GGGGCC repeat expansions of C9orf72 
      gene in patients with SCA3/MJD from mainland China to determine whether the 
      C9orf72 gene plays a role in the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD. In our study, there 
      were no pathogenic repeats (>30 repeats) detected in either the patients or 
      controls. SCA3/MJD patients with intermediate/intermediate or short/intermediate 
      genotype (short: <7 repeats; intermediate: 7-30 repeats) of the GGGGCC repeats 
      had an earlier onset compared with those with short/short genotype. The presence 
      of the intermediate allele of the GGGGCC repeats in the patients decreased the 
      age at onset by nearly 3 years. Our study firstly demonstrate that the 
      development of SCA3/MJD may involve some physiological functions of the C9orf72 
      gene and provide new evidence to the hypothesis that a specific mutation 
      identified in one of the neurodegenerative disorders may be a modulator in this 
      class of diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association of repeat expansion size in 10 common 
      degenerative hereditary ataxia genes with essential tremor. These genes were 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 
      (CACNA1A), SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), 
      SCA-17 (TBP) and dentatorubral-pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA) (ATN1). METHODS: 
      Genetic analysis of repeat size in 10 degenerative hereditary ataxia loci was 
      performed in 323 essential tremor patients and 299 controls enrolled at Columbia 
      University. To test for differences in the allele distribution between patients 
      and controls, a CLUMP analysis was performed. RESULTS: None of the essential 
      tremor patients had a repeat expansion in the intermediate or pathogenic range. 
      Significant differences in the distribution of repeats in the 'normal' range for 
      SCA2 and SCA8 (both p </= 0.02) were observed between essential tremor patients and 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      SCA loci are not associated with essential tremor.

AB  - Few studies have investigated the association between spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3 (SCA3) and psychiatric disorders, using mainly screening scales to assess signs 
      and symptoms of depression and anxiety. With these limitations in mind, we 
      assessed the prevalence of DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric disorders in SCA3 patients 
      and their possible associations with the length of CAG repeats and 
      socio-demographic characteristics, highlighting potential risk factors. DNA 
      samples were collected from 59 adults diagnosed with SCA3 for the quantification 
      of CAG repeats. Next, the patients were assessed in respect to the presence of 
      psychiatric disorders with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. 
      Approximately half of the sample had at least one psychiatric disorder (mood 
      disorders 45.2 %), mainly dysthymia and current depression. There were no 
      statistically significant differences in the length of CAG repeats between 
      subjects with and without psychiatric disorders. The perception that SCA3 has a 
      negative impact on life and the subjective assessment of current health status as 
      poor emerged as risk factors for the occurrence of psychiatric disorders in the 
      sample. There is a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders in SCA3 patients 
      compared to the general population. The lack of association between CAG repeats 
      and occurrence of psychiatric disorders lends support to the hypothesis that 
      psychiatric disorders in this group are associated with adaptive emotional 
      responses to becoming ill.

TI  - Peripheral Neuropathy in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1, 2, 3, and 6.
PG  - 165-73

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are characterized by autosomal dominantly 
      inherited progressive ataxia but are clinically heterogeneous due to variable 
      involvement of non-cerebellar parts of the nervous system. Non-cerebellar 
      symptoms contribute significantly to the burden of SCAs, may guide the clinician 
      to the underlying genetic subtype, and might be useful markers to monitor 
      disease. Peripheral neuropathy is frequently observed in SCA, but 
      subtype-specific features and subclinical manifestations have rarely been 
      evaluated. We performed a multicenter nerve conduction study with 162 patients 
      with genetically confirmed SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6. The study proved 
      peripheral nerves to be involved in the neurodegenerative process in 82 % of 
      SCA1, 63 % of SCA2, 55 % of SCA3, and 22 % of SCA6 patients. Most patients of all 
      subtypes revealed affection of both sensory and motor fibers. Neuropathy was most 
      frequently of mixed type with axonal and demyelinating characteristics in all SCA 
      subtypes. However, nerve conduction velocities of SCA1 patients were slower 
      compared to other genotypes. SCA6 patients revealed less axonal damage than 
      patients with other subtypes. No influence of CAG repeat length or biometric 
      determinants on peripheral neuropathy could be identified in SCA1, SCA3, and 
      SCA6. In SCA2, earlier onset and more severe ataxia were associated with 
      peripheral neuropathy. We proved peripheral neuropathy to be a frequent site of 
      the neurodegenerative process in all common SCA subtypes. Since damage to 
      peripheral nerves is readily assessable by electrophysiological means, nerve 
      conduction studies should be performed in a longitudinal approach to assess these 
      parameters as potential progression markers.

TI  - Clinical Scales Predict Significant Videofluoroscopic Dysphagia in Machado Joseph 
      Disease Patients.
PG  - 260-266
LID - 10.1002/mdc3.12173 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although aspiration is one of the main causes of death in SCA, such 
      as SCA3/Machado Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), clinical studies on dysphagia are 
      lacking for these diseases. The aims of this study were to characterize dysphagia 
      in SCA3/MJD through videofluoroscopy (VF) of swallowing, correlate VF with 
      disease severity criteria and weight loss, and determine the clinical criteria 
      cutoffs for performing VF in the clinical routine, in order to detect aspiration. 
      METHODS: A cross-sectional study on 34 SCA3/MJD patients was performed. Clinical 
      and molecular data, as well as body mass index (BMI), were obtained. Neurological 
      scales, such as the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), and the 
      Swallowing Quality of Life (SWAL-QOL) questionnaire were applied. The VF scores, 
      Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale (DOSS) and penetration/aspiration scale 
      (PAS), were obtained: Moderate-to-severe scores were grouped as "significant 
      dysphagia." RESULTS: Overall, 31 of 34 individuals showed abnormal scores at VF. 
      SARA, BMI, and the domain "eating duration" of SWAL-QOL correlated with VF: Their 
      relation to significant dysphagia (DOSS <4 points or PAS >3) was evaluated 
      through receiver operating characteristic curves. A sensitivity of 100% was 
      equivalent to a cutoff of 15 points on SARA score, 23.72 kg/m(2) on BMI, and 60% 
      on eating duration-SWAL-QOL (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Significant dysphagia was not 
      related to age at onset, disease duration, or CAG repeat expansion, but with SARA 
      scores, lower BMI, and the domain eating duration of SWAL-QOL. As a guideline for 
      preventing aspiration, we suggest that SARA scores greater than 15 or eating 
      duration-SWAL-QOL lower than 60% should urge VF studies in SCA3/MJD.

TI  - Examination of Ataxin-3 (atx-3) Aggregation by Structural Mass Spectrometry 
      Techniques: A Rationale for Expedited Aggregation upon Polyglutamine (polyQ) 
      Expansion.
PG  - 1241-53
LID - 10.1074/mcp.M114.044610 [doi]
AB  - Expansion of polyglutamine stretches leads to the formation of 
      polyglutamine-containing neuronal aggregates and neuronal death in nine diseases 
      for which there currently are no treatments or cures. This is largely due to a 
      lack in understanding of the mechanisms by which expanded polyglutamine regions 
      contribute to aggregation and disease. To complicate matters further, several of 
      the polyglutamine-disease related proteins, including ataxin-3, have a multistage 
      aggregation mechanism in which flanking domain self-assembly precedes 
      polyglutamine aggregation yet is influenced by polyglutamine expansion. How 
      polyglutamine expansion influences flanking domain aggregation is poorly 
      understood. Here, we use a combination of mass spectrometry and biophysical 
      approaches to investigate this issue for ataxin-3. We show that the 
      conformational dynamics of the flanking Josephin domain in ataxin-3 with an 
      expanded polyglutamine tract are altered in comparison to those exhibited by its 
      nonexpanded counterpart, specifically within the aggregation-prone region of the 
      Josephin domain (amino acid residues 73-96). Expansion thus exposes this region 
      more frequently in ataxin-3 containing an expanded polyglutamine tract, providing 
      a molecular explanation of why aggregation is accelerated upon polyglutamine 
      expansion. Here, harnessing the power of ion mobility spectrometry-mass 
      spectrometry, oligomeric species formed during aggregation are characterized and 
      a model for oligomer growth proposed. The results suggest that a conformational 
      change occurs at the dimer level that initiates self-assembly. New insights into 
      ataxin-3 fibril architecture are also described, revealing the region of the 
      Josephin domain involved in protofibril formation and demonstrating that 
      polyglutamine aggregation proceeds as a distinct second step after protofibril 
      formation without requiring structural rearrangement of the protofibril core. 
      Overall, the results enable the effect of polyglutamine expansion on every stage 
      of ataxin-3 self-assembly, from monomer through to fibril, to be described and a 
      rationale for expedited aggregation upon polyglutamine expansion to be provided.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) is predominantly characterized 
      by action tremor, followed by slowly progressive cerebellar dysfunction. It is a 
      very rare disorder and only identified in certain countries so far. The current 
      appreciation for phenotypic and genotypic features of SCA12 is still limited. 
      METHODS: We investigated CAG copies within PPP2R2B in 29 patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia who are excluded from the most common SCA subtypes 
      including SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6. The medical data of patients carrying 
      abnormal expanded PPP2R2B allele were reviewed and summarized. RESULTS: We found 
      that 3 patients carried 53, 46 and 54 CAG repeats respectively, while the other 
      26 cases harbored CAG repeats less than 30. The probably shortest pathogenic 
      allele of 46 repeats was detected in one kindred typically experiencing action 
      tremor. Additionally, compared to the prominent cerebellar ataxia, nystagmus and 
      dysphagia seem to be rare in our SCA12 patients. CONCLUSIONS: SCA12 might not be 
      as rare in Chinese as previously assumed. The identification of the shortest 
      pathogenic allele helps to define the minimal limit implicated in the disease 
      onset. Moreover, the disease manifestations distinct from other SCA subtypes 
      could help clinicians to provide timely genetic counseling.

TI  - The role of the mammalian DNA end-processing enzyme polynucleotide kinase 
      3'-phosphatase in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 pathogenesis.

AB  - DNA strand-breaks (SBs) with non-ligatable ends are generated by ionizing 
      radiation, oxidative stress, various chemotherapeutic agents, and also as base 
      excision repair (BER) intermediates. Several neurological diseases have already 
      been identified as being due to a deficiency in DNA end-processing activities. 
      Two common dirty ends, 3'-P and 5'-OH, are processed by mammalian polynucleotide 
      kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP), a bifunctional enzyme with 3'-phosphatase and 
      5'-kinase activities. We have made the unexpected observation that PNKP stably 
      associates with Ataxin-3 (ATXN3), a polyglutamine repeat-containing protein 
      mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph 
      Disease (MJD). This disease is one of the most common dominantly inherited 
      ataxias worldwide; the defect in SCA3 is due to CAG repeat expansion (from the 
      normal 14-41 to 55-82 repeats) in the ATXN3 coding region. However, how the 
      expanded form gains its toxic function is still not clearly understood. Here we 
      report that purified wild-type (WT) ATXN3 stimulates, and by contrast the mutant 
      form specifically inhibits, PNKP's 3' phosphatase activity in vitro. 
      ATXN3-deficient cells also show decreased PNKP activity. Furthermore, transgenic 
      mice conditionally expressing the pathological form of human ATXN3 also showed 
      decreased 3'-phosphatase activity of PNKP, mostly in the deep cerebellar nuclei, 
      one of the most affected regions in MJD patients' brain. Finally, long amplicon 
      quantitative PCR analysis of human MJD patients' brain samples showed a 
      significant accumulation of DNA strand breaks. Our results thus indicate that the 
      accumulation of DNA strand breaks due to functional deficiency of PNKP is 
      etiologically linked to the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), 
      is an untreatable autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease, and the most 
      common such inherited ataxia worldwide. The mutation in SCA3 is the expansion of 
      a polymorphic CAG tri-nucleotide repeat sequence in the C-terminal coding region 
      of the ATXN3 gene at chromosomal locus 14q32.1. The mutant ATXN3 protein encoding 
      expanded glutamine (polyQ) sequences interacts with multiple proteins in vivo, 
      and is deposited as aggregates in the SCA3 brain. A large body of literature 
      suggests that the loss of function of the native ATNX3-interacting proteins that 
      are deposited in the polyQ aggregates contributes to cellular toxicity, systemic 
      neurodegeneration and the pathogenic mechanism in SCA3. Nonetheless, a 
      significant understanding of the disease etiology of SCA3, the molecular 
      mechanism by which the polyQ expansions in the mutant ATXN3 induce 
      neurodegeneration in SCA3 has remained elusive. In the present study, we show 
      that the essential DNA strand break repair enzyme PNKP (polynucleotide kinase 
      3'-phosphatase) interacts with, and is inactivated by, the mutant ATXN3, 
      resulting in inefficient DNA repair, persistent accumulation of DNA damage/strand 
      breaks, and subsequent chronic activation of the DNA damage-response ataxia 
      telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) signaling pathway in SCA3. We report that persistent 
      accumulation of DNA damage/strand breaks and chronic activation of the 
      serine/threonine kinase ATM and the downstream p53 and protein kinase C-delta 
      pro-apoptotic pathways trigger neuronal dysfunction and eventually neuronal death 
      in SCA3. Either PNKP overexpression or pharmacological inhibition of ATM 
      dramatically blocked mutant ATXN3-mediated cell death. Discovery of the mechanism 
      by which mutant ATXN3 induces DNA damage and amplifies the pro-death signaling 
      pathways provides a molecular basis for neurodegeneration due to PNKP 
      inactivation in SCA3, and for the first time offers a possible approach to 
      treatment.

AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that are related 
      to at least 36 different genetic loci; they are clinically characterized by 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia and are frequently accompanied by other 
      neurological and non-neurological manifestations. The relative frequency of SCA 
      varies greatly among different regions, presumably because of a founder effect or 
      local ethnicities. Between July 1998 and May 2012, we investigated 320 Brazilian 
      patients with an SCA phenotype who belonged to 150 unrelated families with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and 23 sporadic patients from 13 Brazilian 
      states. A total of 265 patients (82.8%) belonging to 131 unrelated families 
      (87.3%) were found to have a definite mutation, and SCA3 accounted for most of 
      the familial cases (70.7%), followed by SCA7 (6%), SCA1 (5.3%), SCA2 (2.7%), SCA6 
      (1.3%), SCA8 (0.7%) and SCA10 (0.7%). In the Ribeirao Preto mesoregion, which is 
      located in the northeast part of Sao Paulo State, the prevalence of SCA3 was 
      approximately 5 per 100,000 inhabitants, which is the highest prevalence found in 
      Brazil. No mutation was found in the SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA genes, and all the 
      sporadic cases remained without a molecular diagnosis. This study further 
      characterizes the spectrum of SCA mutations found in Brazilian patients, which 
      suggests the existence of regional differences and demonstrates the expansion of 
      the SCA8 locus in Brazilian families.

TI  - A knockin mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 exhibits prominent 
      aggregate pathology and aberrant splicing of the disease gene transcript.
PG  - 1211-24
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddu532 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine diseases, including spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), are 
      caused by CAG repeat expansions that encode abnormally long glutamine repeats in 
      the respective disease proteins. While the mechanisms underlying 
      neurodegeneration remain uncertain, evidence supports a proteotoxic role for the 
      mutant protein dictated in part by the specific genetic and protein context. To 
      further define pathogenic mechanisms in SCA3, we generated a mouse model in which 
      a CAG expansion of 82 repeats was inserted into the murine locus by homologous 
      recombination. SCA3 knockin mice exhibit region-specific aggregate pathology 
      marked by intranuclear accumulation of the mutant Atxn3 protein, abundant nuclear 
      inclusions and, in select brain regions, extranuclear aggregates localized to 
      neuritic processes. Knockin mice also display altered splicing of the disease 
      gene, promoting expression of an alternative isoform in which the intron 
      immediately downstream of the CAG repeat is retained. In an independent mouse 
      model expressing the full human ATXN3 disease gene, expression of this 
      alternatively spliced transcript is also enhanced. These results, together with 
      recent findings in other polyglutamine diseases, suggest that CAG repeat 
      expansions can promote aberrant splicing to produce potentially more 
      aggregate-prone isoforms of the disease proteins. This report of a SCA3 knockin 
      mouse expands the repertoire of existing models of SCA3, and underscores the 
      potential contribution of alternative splicing to disease pathogenesis in SCA3 
      and other polyglutamine disorders.

TI  - Ubiquitin-binding site 2 of ataxin-3 prevents its proteasomal degradation by 
      interacting with Rad23.
PG  - 4638

AB  - Polyglutamine repeat expansion in ataxin-3 causes neurodegeneration in the most 
      common dominant ataxia, spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). Since reducing 
      levels of disease proteins improves pathology in animals, we investigated how 
      ataxin-3 is degraded. Here we show that, unlike most proteins, ataxin-3 turnover 
      does not require its ubiquitination, but is regulated by ubiquitin-binding site 2 
      (UbS2) on its N terminus. Mutating UbS2 decreases ataxin-3 protein levels in 
      cultured mammalian cells and in Drosophila melanogaster by increasing its 
      proteasomal turnover. Ataxin-3 interacts with the proteasome-associated proteins 
      Rad23A/B through UbS2. Knockdown of Rad23 in cultured cells and in Drosophila 
      results in lower levels of ataxin-3 protein. Importantly, reducing Rad23 
      suppresses ataxin-3-dependent degeneration in flies. We present a mechanism for 
      ubiquitination-independent degradation that is impeded by protein interactions 
      with proteasome-associated factors. We conclude that UbS2 is a potential target 
      through which to enhance ataxin-3 degradation for SCA3 therapy.

TI  - Dominant negative effect of polyglutamine expansion perturbs normal function of 
      ataxin-3 in neuronal cells.
PG  - 100-17
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddu422 [doi]
AB  - The physiological function of Ataxin-3 (ATXN3), a deubiquitylase (DUB) involved 
      in Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD), remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate 
      that ATXN3 is required for neuronal differentiation and for normal cell 
      morphology, cytoskeletal organization, proliferation and survival of SH-SY5Y and 
      PC12 cells. This cellular phenotype is associated with increased proteasomal 
      degradation of alpha5 integrin subunit (ITGA5) and reduced activation of integrin 
      signalling and is rescued by ITGA5 overexpression. Interestingly, silencing of 
      ATXN3, overexpression of mutant versions of ATXN3 lacking catalytic activity or 
      bearing an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract led to partially overlapping 
      phenotypes. In vivo analysis showed that both Atxn3 knockout and MJD transgenic 
      mice had decreased levels of ITGA5 in the brain. Furthermore, abnormal morphology 
      and reduced branching were observed both in cultured neurons expressing shRNA for 
      ATXN3 and in those obtained from MJD mice. Our results show that ATXN3 rescues 
      ITGA5 from proteasomal degradation in neurons and that polyQ expansion causes a 
      partial loss of this cellular function, resulting in reduced integrin signalling 
      and neuronal cytoskeleton modifications, which may be contributing to 
      neurodegeneration.

AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is caused by a (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      that is translated into an abnormally long polyglutamine tract. This disease is 
      considered the most common form of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). In the present 
      study, we developed stable inducible cell lines (PC12Tet-On-Ataxin-3-Q28/84) 
      expressing ataxin-3 with either normal or abnormal CAG repeats under doxycycline 
      control. The expression of acetyl histone H3 and the induction of c-Fos in 
      response to cAMP were strongly suppressed in cells expressing the protein with 
      the expanded polyglutamine tract. Treatment with valproic acid, a histone 
      deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), attenuated mutant ataxin-3-induced cell toxicity 
      and suppression of acetyl histone H3, phosphorylated cAMP-responsive element 
      binding protein (p-CREB) as well as c-Fos expression. These results indicate that 
      VPA can stimulate the up-regulation of gene transcription through 
      hyperacetylation. Thus, VPA might have a therapeutic effect on MJD.

TI  - Modifiers of (CAG)(n) instability in Machado-Joseph disease (MJD/SCA3) 
      transmissions: an association study with DNA replication, repair and 
      recombination genes.
PG  - 1311-8
LID - 10.1007/s00439-014-1467-8 [doi]
AB  - Twelve neurological disorders are caused by gene-specific CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions that are highly unstable upon transmission to offspring. This 
      intergenerational repeat instability is clinically relevant since disease onset, 
      progression and severity are associated with repeat size. Studies of model 
      organisms revealed the involvement of some DNA replication and repair genes in 
      the process of repeat instability, however, little is known about their role in 
      patients. Here, we used an association study to search for genetic modifiers of 
      (CAG)n instability in 137 parent-child transmissions in Machado-Joseph disease 
      (MJD/SCA3). With the hypothesis that variants in genes involved in DNA 
      replication, repair or recombination might alter the MJD CAG instability 
      patterns, we screened 768 SNPs from 93 of these genes. We found a variant in 
      ERCC6 (rs2228528) associated with an expansion bias of MJD alleles. When using a 
      gene-gene interaction model, the allele combination G-A (rs4140804-rs2972388) of 
      RPA3-CDK7 is also associated with MJD instability in a direction-dependent 
      manner. Interestingly, the transcription-coupled repair factor ERCC6 (aka CSB), 
      the single-strand binding protein RPA, and the CDK7 kinase part of the TFIIH 
      transcription repair complex, have all been linked to transcription-coupled 
      repair. This is the first study performed in patient samples to implicate 
      specific modifiers of CAG instability in humans. In summary, we found variants in 
      three transcription-coupled repair genes associated with the MJD mutation that 
      points to distinct mechanisms of (CAG)n instability.

TI  - Modulation of the age at onset in spinocerebellar ataxia by CAG tracts in various 
      genes.
PG  - 2444-55
LID - 10.1093/brain/awu174 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine-coding (CAG)n repeat expansions in seven different genes cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxias. Although the size of the expansion is negatively 
      correlated with age at onset, it accounts for only 50-70% of its variability. To 
      find other factors involved in this variability, we performed a regression 
      analysis in 1255 affected individuals with identified expansions (spinocerebellar 
      ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7), recruited through the European Consortium on 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxias, to determine whether age at onset is influenced by the 
      size of the normal allele in eight causal (CAG)n-containing genes (ATXN1-3, 6-7, 
      17, ATN1 and HTT). We confirmed the negative effect of the expanded allele and 
      detected threshold effects reflected by a quadratic association between age at 
      onset and CAG size in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 3 and 6. We also evidenced 
      an interaction between the expanded and normal alleles in trans in individuals 
      with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 6 and 7. Except for individuals with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, age at onset was also influenced by other 
      (CAG)n-containing genes: ATXN7 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2; ATXN2, ATN1 and 
      HTT in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3; ATXN1 and ATXN3 in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 6; and ATXN3 and TBP in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7. This suggests that 
      there are biological relationships among these genes. The results were partially 
      replicated in four independent populations representing 460 Caucasians and 216 
      Asian samples; the differences are possibly explained by ethnic or geographical 
      differences. As the variability in age at onset is not completely explained by 
      the effects of the causative and modifier sister genes, other genetic or 
      environmental factors must also play a role in these diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA)--SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and 
      SCA6--are caused by (CAG)n repeat expansion. While the number of repeats of the 
      coding (CAG)n expansions is correlated with the age at onset, there are no 
      appropriate models that include both affected and preclinical carriers allowing 
      for the prediction of age at onset. METHODS: We combined data from two major 
      European cohorts of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6 mutation carriers: 1187 affected 
      individuals from the EUROSCA registry and 123 preclinical individuals from the 
      RISCA cohort. For each SCA genotype, a regression model was fitted using a 
      log-normal distribution for age at onset with the repeat length of the alleles as 
      covariates. From these models, we calculated expected age at onset from birth and 
      conditionally that this age is greater than the current age. RESULTS: For SCA2 
      and SCA3 genotypes, the expanded allele was a significant predictor of age at 
      onset (-0.105+/-0.005 and -0.056+/-0.003) while for SCA1 and SCA6 genotypes both the 
      size of the expanded and normal alleles were significant (expanded: -0.049+/-0.002 
      and -0.090+/-0.009, respectively; normal: +0.013+/-0.005 and -0.029+/-0.010, 
      respectively). According to the model, we indicated the median values (90% 
      critical region) and the expectancy (SD) of the predicted age at onset for each 
      SCA genotype according to the CAG repeat size and current age. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      estimations can be valuable in clinical and research. However, results need to be 
      confirmed in other independent cohorts and in future longitudinal studies.

TI  - APOE epsilon2 allele may decrease the age at onset in patients with spinocerebellar

AB  - Polymorphism of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene has been defined as a modifying 
      factor for age at onset (AO) in neurodegenerative disorders. The AO of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 or Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3 or MJD) is 
      inversely correlated with expanded CAG repeat lengths in the ATXN3 gene; however, 
      AO is only partially explained by the expanded CAG repeats. We performed a 
      case-control study to explore whether APOE genotypes play a role in AO of SCA3 or 
      MJD from the Chinese Han population. The APOE genotypes were analyzed in an 
      independent cohort of 155 patients with SCA3 or MJD and 191 controls both from 
      Mainland China. Our study demonstrated that SCA3 or MJD patients experienced an 
      earlier onset if they were carriers of APOE epsilon2 allele, which decreased the AO by 
      nearly 4 years. This study may also reconfirm the effect of the APOE gene on SCA3 
      or MJD patients from different races and indicated that certain APOE alleles 
      might be genetic modifiers for AO in SCA3 or MJD.

TI  - Aqueous extract of Glycyrrhiza inflata inhibits aggregation by upregulating

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17 and 
      dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy, as well as Huntington disease, are a group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders caused by a CAG triplet-repeat expansion encoding a 
      long polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the respective mutant proteins. The 
      cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregate formation, a pathological hallmark of polyQ 
      diseases, is probably the initial process triggering the subsequent pathological 
      events. Compromised oxidative stress defense capacity and mitochondrial 
      dysfunction have emerged as contributing factors to the pathogenesis of polyQ 
      diseases. The roots of licorice (Glycyrrhiza species) have long been used as an 
      herbal medicine. In this study, we demonstrate the aggregate-inhibitory effect of 
      Glycyrrhiza inflata herb extract and its constituents licochalcone A and ammonium 
      glycyrrhizinate (AMGZ) in both 293 and SH-SY5Y ATXN3/Q75 cells, SCA3 cell models. 
      The reporter assay showed that G. inflata herb extract, licochalcone A, and AMGZ 
      could enhance the promoter activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
      gamma, coactivator 1alpha (PPARGC1A), a known regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and 
      antioxidative response genes. G. inflata extract, licochalcone A, and AMGZ 
      upregulated PPARGC1A expression and its downstream target genes, SOD2 and CYCS, 
      in the 293 ATXN3/Q75 cell model. The expression of nuclear factor erythroid 
      2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2), the principal transcription factor that binds to 
      antioxidant-responsive elements (AREs) to promote ARE-dependent gene expression 
      when the cells respond to oxidative stress, and its downstream genes, HMOX1, 
      NQO1, GCLC, and GSTP1, was also increased by G. inflata herb extract, 
      licochalcone A, and AMGZ. Knockdown of PPARGC1A increased aggregates in ATXN3/Q75 
      cells and also attenuated the aggregate-inhibiting effect of the tested 
      compounds. G. inflata extract and its constituents significantly elevated 
      GSH/GSSG ratio and reduced reactive oxidative species in ATXN3/Q75 cells. The 
      study results suggest that the tested agents activate PPARGC1A activity and 
      NFE2L2-ARE signaling to increase mitochondrial biogenesis, decrease oxidative 
      stress, and reduce aggregate formation in SCA3 cellular models.

AB  - We evaluated the contributions of various polyglutamine (polyQ) disease genes to 
      Parkinson's disease (PD). We compared the distributions of polyQ repeat lengths 
      in 8 common genes (ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, ATN1, and HTT) in 
      299 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant PD (ADPD) and 329 normal controls. 
      We also analyzed the possibility of genetic interactions between ATXN1 and ATXN2, 
      ATXN2 and ATXN3, and ATXN2 and CACNA1A. Intermediate-length polyQ expansions (>24 
      Qs) of ATXN2 were found in 7 ADPD patients and no controls (7/299 = 2.34% and 
      0/329 = 0%, respectively; p = 0.0053 < 0.05/8 after Bonferroni correction). These 
      patients showed typical L-DOPA-responsive PD phenotypes. Conversely, no 
      significant differences in polyQ repeat lengths were found between the ADPD 
      patients and the controls for the other 7 genes. Our results may support the 
      hypothesis that ATXN2 polyQ expansion is a specific predisposing factor for 
      multiple neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown cognitive impairment in patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). However, there is a lack of data on Chinese 
      patients with SCA3. METHOD: We investigated 22 native Chinese with SCA3 and 18 
      controls matched for age, education as well as mental status. Cognitive 
      assessments were carefully carried out to measure verbal fluency, memory, 
      attention, executive function, visuospatial and visuoconstructive functions. 
      RESULTS: The most common impairments of cognition in native Chinese with SCA3 
      were disruption of phonemic verbal fluency and frontal executive dysfunction. 
      Deficits in semantic fluency were detected in about 31.8% patients. Impaired 
      visuospatial function and verbal memory were also found in native Chinese with 
      SCA3. The degree of ataxia, CAG repeat length and education were found to 
      correlate with cognitive performance. Multivariate binary logistic regression 
      suggested that an oculomotor disorder and depression are predictors of cognitive 
      impairment. CONCLUSION: Native Chinese with SCA3 had cognitive impairment of 
      frontal executive function, temporal and parietal functions. An oculomotor 
      disorder might be an index of cognitive dysfunction.

PG  - 275-81

AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansions that lead to the formation of amyloid 
      aggregates are linked to several devastating neurodegenerative disorders. While 
      molecular chaperones, including the small heat shock proteins (sHsp), play an 
      important role in protection against protein misfolding, the aberrant protein 
      folding that accompanies these polyQ diseases overwhelms the chaperone network. 
      By generating a model structure to explain the observed suppression of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) by the sHsp alphaB-crystallin, we have identified key 
      vulnerabilities that provide a possible mechanism to explain this heat shock 
      response. A docking study involving a small bioactive peptide should also aid in 
      the development of new drug targets for the prevention of polyQ-based 
      aggregation.

TI  - Association between spinocerebellar ataxias caused by glutamine expansion and 
      psychiatric and neuropsychological signals - a literature review.
PG  - 57-69
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, also known as spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCA), are characterized by cerebellar degeneration and by their afferent and 
      efferent connections. Currently, at least 31 types of SCA are described, among 
      which a subset, comprising types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 17 of the disease, is 
      distinguished due to sharing the same form of mutation involving the repetition 
      of the series of CAG triplets, known as polyglutamine diseases (SCApolyQ). 
      Through a systematic literature review using the Pubmed, PsycoINFO, LILACS and 
      SciELO databases and the keywords Spinocerebellar Ataxia in association with the 
      words neuropsychiatric, psychological, cognitive impairment(s) and psychiatric 
      comorbidities this study aimed to identify the possible associations between 
      SCApolyQ and neuropsychological and psychiatric symptoms/disorders. A greater 
      presence of symptoms of depression and anxiety was evidenced, as well as the 
      existence of cognitive impairments in the patients with SCApolyQ when compared 
      with the general population, with important differences in the profile of these 
      impairments among the types of SCA. It was observed that the findings, in 
      general, indicated greater impairment in the executive functions, verbal fluency 
      and verbal memory and that there was a higher concentration of studies for SCA2 
      and SCA3. However, there is a need for a greater number of studies using a more 
      homogeneous methodology, which perform direct comparisons between the types of 
      ataxias and that explore some of the still little evaluated neuropsychological 
      functions and the different psychiatric disorders in their amplitude.

AB  - Previous studies demonstrated cognitive impairments in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 3 (SCA3/MJD); however, there is no consensus about the cognitive domains 
      affected and the correlation with structural brain abnormalities. We investigated 
      the neuropsychological profile and 3T-MRI findings, including high-resolution 
      T1-images, diffusion tensor imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy of 32 
      patients with SCA3/MJD and 32 age-, gender- and educational level-matched healthy 
      controls. We reviewed patients' clinical history and CAG repeat length, and 
      performed assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA)-Brazilian version and the 
      neuropsychiatric inventory. Patients presented worse performance in episodic and 
      working memory and Beck inventories (depression and anxiety). SCA3/MJD patients 
      had a reduction of gray matter volume (GM) in the cerebellum, putamen, cingulum, 
      precentral and parietal lobe. A positive correlation was identified between the 
      cognitive findings and GM of temporal, frontal, parietal, culmen and insula. We 
      observed positive correlation between the brainstem's fractional anisotropy and 
      digit span-forward. The following cerebellar metabolite groups (measured relative 
      to creatine) were reduced in patients: N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), NAA + 
      N-acetyl-aspartate-glutamate and glutamate + glutamine (Glx). We found a positive 
      correlation between Corsi's block-tapping task forward with Glx; semantic verbal 
      fluency with phosphorylcholine and glycerophosphorylcholine; digits span-forward 
      with NAA. The cognitive impairments in SCA3/MJD are associated not only with 
      cerebellar and brainstem abnormalities, but also with neuroimaging evidence of 
      diffuse neuronal and axonal dysfunction, particularly in temporal, frontal, 
      parietal and insular areas.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the 
      ataxin-3 protein, resulting in gain of toxic function of the mutant protein. The 
      expanded glutamine stretch in the protein is the result of a CAG triplet repeat 
      expansion in the penultimate exon of the ATXN3 gene. Several gene silencing 
      approaches to reduce mutant ataxin-3 toxicity in this disease aim to lower 
      ataxin-3 protein levels, but since this protein is involved in deubiquitination 
      and proteasomal protein degradation, its long-term silencing might not be 
      desirable. Here, we propose a novel protein modification approach to reduce 
      mutant ataxin-3 toxicity by removing the toxic polyglutamine repeat from the 
      ataxin-3 protein through antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping while 
      maintaining important wild type functions of the protein. In vitro studies showed 
      that exon skipping did not negatively impact the ubiquitin binding capacity of 
      ataxin-3. Our in vivo studies showed no toxic properties of the novel truncated 
      ataxin-3 protein. These results suggest that exon skipping may be a novel

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias are dominantly inherited disorders that are associated 
      with progressive brain degeneration, mainly affecting the cerebellum and 
      brainstem. As part of the multicentre European integrated project on 
      spinocerebellar ataxias study, 37 patients with spinocerebellar ataxia-1, 19 with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-3 and seven with spinocerebellar ataxia-6 were clinically 
      examined and underwent magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and after a 2-year 
      follow-up. All patients were compared with age-matched and gender-matched healthy 
      control subjects. Magnetic resonance imaging analysis included three-dimensional 
      volumetry and observer-independent longitudinal voxel-based morphometry. 
      Volumetry revealed loss of brainstem, cerebellar and basal ganglia volume in all 
      genotypes. Most sensitive to change was the pontine volume in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia-1, striatal volume in spinocerebellar ataxia-3 and caudate volume in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-6. Sensitivity to change, as measured by standard response 
      mean, of the respective MRI measures was greater than that of the most sensitive 
      clinical measure, the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia. Longitudinal 
      voxel-based morphometry revealed greatest grey matter loss in the cerebellum and 
      brainstem in spinocerebellar ataxia-1, in the putamen and pallidum in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-3 and in the cerebellum, thalamus, putamen and pallidum in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-6. There was a mild correlation between CAG repeat length 
      and volume loss of the bilateral cerebellum and the pons in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia-1. Quantitative volumetry and voxel-based morphometry imaging demonstrated 
      genotype-specific patterns of atrophy progression in spinocerebellar ataxias-1, 3 
      and 6, and they showed a high sensitivity to detect change that was superior to 
      clinical scales. These structural magnetic resonance imaging findings have the 
      potential to serve as surrogate markers, which might help to delineate 
      quantifiable endpoints and non-invasive methods for rapid and reliable data 
      acquisition, encouraging their use in clinical trials.

AB  - Autonomic dysfunction has been already described in patients with SCA3/MJD, but 
      several important questions remain unanswered. The objectives of this study are 
      to determine the frequency and the intensity of autonomic manifestations in 
      SCA3/MJD, as well as to identify possible correlations between autonomic 
      manifestations and genetic and clinical parameters. We have performed clinical 
      and electrophysiological evaluations of 40 patients with SCA3/MJD and 38 healthy 
      controls. We used the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and 
      the scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease: Autonomic Questionnaire to 
      quantify the severity of ataxia and autonomic complaints, respectively. We also 
      studied heart rate variability at rest, during orthostatic challenge (30:15 
      ratio), Valsalva maneuver (Valsalva index), and deep breathing (E/I ratio). We 
      evaluated spectral analyses of RR intervals at rest and the sympathetic skin 
      response. Mean RR intervals at rest and the 30:15 ratio were different between 
      patients and controls (811.8 versus 933.4 ms; p = 0.001 and 1.10 versus 1.15; p = 
      0.038, respectively). The Valsalva index and the E/I ratio were similar between 
      the groups (p = 0.373 and p = 0.08). Spectral analysis presented distinct results 
      in patients and controls, related to low- and high-frequency power (p < 0.001 and 
      <0.001, respectively). We found cardiovascular and sympathetic sweat disautonomia 
      in 30 % and 45 % of the patients with SCA3/MJD. Autonomic manifestations were 
      related neither to genetic (CAG repeat length) nor clinical parameters (age, 
      disease duration, SARA scores). Autonomic dysfunction is frequent and sometimes 
      disabling in SCA3/MJD. We found evidence of both cardiovascular and sudomotor 
      dysfunction in the disease.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) also known as Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD), 
      is one of nine polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases caused by a CAG-trinucelotide 
      repeat expansion within the coding sequence of the ATXN3 gene. There are no 
      disease-modifying treatments for polyQ diseases. Recent studies suggest that an 
      imbalance in histone acetylation may be a key process leading to transcriptional 
      dysregulation in polyQ diseases. Because of this possible imbalance, the 
      application of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors may be feasible for the 
      treatment of polyQ diseases. To further explore the therapeutic potential of HDAC 
      inhibitors, we constructed two independent preclinical trials with valproic acid 
      (VPA), a promising therapeutic HDAC inhibitor, in both Drosophila and cell SCA3 
      models. We demonstrated that prolonged use of VPA at specific dose partly 
      prevented eye depigmentation, alleviated climbing disability, and extended the 
      average lifespan of SCA3/MJD transgenic Drosophila. We found that VPA could both 
      increase the acetylation levels of histone H3 and histone H4 and reduce the early 
      apoptotic rate of cells without inhibiting the aggregation of mutant ataxin-3 
      proteins in MJDtr-Q68- expressing cells. These results collectively support the 
      premise that VPA is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of SCA3 and 
      other polyQ diseases.

LID - 10.1111/cge.12114 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. CAG (cytosine-adenine-guanine) trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 
      causative genes have been identified as the cause of different SCA. In this 
      study, we simultaneously genotyped SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 applying a 
      fluorescent multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay. We analyzed 10 families 
      with SCA (64 patients) from five different communities of Veracruz, a Mexican 
      southeastern state, and identified 55 patients for SCA7 and 9 for SCA2, but none 
      for SCA1, SCA3, or SCA6. To our knowledge, this sample represents one of the 
      largest series of SCA7 cases reported worldwide. Genotyping of 300 healthy 
      individuals from Mexican population and compiled data from different ethnicities 
      showed discordant results concerning the hypothesis that SCA disease alleles 
      arise by expansion of large normal alleles.

AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) encompass a heterogeneous group of 
      rare diseases that affect the cerebellum and its connections. The most common 
      forms have been associated with dynamic mutations while some rarer forms with 
      conventional mutations. Studies in different populations revealed differences in 
      their relative frequencies both within and between the studied populations, 
      showing that the frequencies are depended on ethnic and geographical factors. 
      Previous investigation of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in the Cypriot population, revealed no 
      pathogenic expansion in the Cypriot SCA patients. We hereby present our recent 
      investigation of the SCA10 pentanucleotide repeat expansion. Forty-two 
      ascertained Cypriot sporadic ataxia patients, the index case from 1 ADCA and 14 
      ARCA families and a cohort of normal population individuals were included in the 
      study. All our patients have normal range ATXN10 gene ATTCT repeat numbers 
      (10-19). In the normal population group, repeat lengths ranged from 11 to 20 with 
      the 14 repeats allele being the most frequent. Therefore, all currently 
      established dynamic repeat SCA mutations are absent from the Cypriot population, 
      indicating distinct genetic causes.

TI  - Analysis of spinocerebellar ataxias due to expanded triplet repeats in Greek 
      patients with cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 178-80
LID - 10.1016/j.jns.2012.03.019 [doi]
AB  - The relative frequency of different autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, 
      commonly referred to as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), varies considerably among 
      populations of different ethnic origin. No data exist at present on the frequency 
      of different SCAs in the Greek population. In the present study we investigated 
      the presence of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in a cohort of 83 Greek patients with slowly 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia. Twenty patients came from autosomal dominant (AD) 
      pedigrees, seven displayed recessive or unclear inheritance and 56 were sporadic. 
      We found four patients with pathological SCA expansions, all from AD pedigrees. 
      Two patients had SCA1, one SCA2 and one SCA7 (10.0, 5.0 and 5.0% of the AD group, 
      respectively). The clinical features of these patients were within the expected 
      spectrum. In total, a pathological expansion was detected in 20% of patients from 
      AD pedigrees. Interestingly, no cases of SCA3 or SCA6 were detected in the AD 
      group. No expansions were found in other familial cases or in sporadic patients. 
      Overall, no cases of SCA3, SCA6, SCA12, SCA17 or DRPLA were identified in the 
      Greek population. In conclusion, SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 are present in Greek 
      patients with AD cerebellar ataxia in frequencies similar to those observed in 
      other populations. SCA3 and SCA6 appear however to be rare in Greece. The genetic 
      cause for the majority of AD ataxias remains to be identified.

TI  - Mutational origin of Machado-Joseph disease in the Australian Aboriginal 
      communities of Groote Eylandt and Yirrkala.
PG  - 746-51

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the presence of Machado-Joseph disease (MJD, also 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 [SCA3]) among Australian aborigines was caused by a 
      new mutational event or by the introduction of expanded alleles from other 
      populations. DESIGN: We sequenced a region of 4 kilobases (kb), encompassing the 
      CAG repeat within the ATXN3 gene, in 2 affected Australian aboriginal families 
      and compared them with the Joseph and Machado lineages described before. 
      Full-extended haplotypes (including also more distant single-nucleotide 
      polymorphisms and flanking short tandem repeats) were assessed by segregation and 
      allele-specific amplification. A phylogenetic tree was inferred from genetic 
      distances, and age of the Australasian Joseph-derived lineage was estimated. 
      SETTING: The aboriginal communities of Groote Eylandt and Yirrkala, in the 
      Northern Territories, Australia (local ethics institutional permission was 
      granted, and both community and individual informed consent was obtained). 
      SUBJECTS: A convenience sample of 19 patients and unaffected relatives, from 2 
      Australian aboriginal families affected with MJD; 40 families with MJD of 
      multiethnic origins and 50 unrelated Asian control subjects. RESULTS: The 2 
      aboriginal families shared the same full haplotype, including 20 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms:TTGATCGAGC-(CAG)(Exp)-CACCCAGCGC, that is, the 
      Joseph lineage with a G variant in rs56268847.Among 33 families with the Joseph 
      lineage, this derived haplotype was found only in 5 of 16 Taiwanese, all 3 
      Indian,and 1 of 3 Japanese families analyzed. CONCLUSION: A related-extended MJD 
      haplotype shared by Australian aborigines and some Asian families (a 
      Joseph-derived lineage) suggests a common ancestor for all, dating back more than 
      7000 years.

TI  - Genetic screening of Greek patients with Huntington's disease phenocopies 
      identifies an SCA8 expansion.
PG  - 1874-8
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a 
      triad of chorea, psychiatric disturbance and cognitive decline. Around 1% of 
      patients with HD-like symptoms lack the causative HD expansion and are considered 
      HD phenocopies. Genetic diseases that can present as HD phenocopies include 
      HD-like syndromes such as HDL1, HDL2 and HDL4 (SCA17), some spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCAs) and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). In this study we 
      screened a cohort of 21 Greek patients with HD phenocopy syndromes formutations 
      causing HDL2, SCA17, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3,SCA8, SCA12 and DRPLA. Fifteen patients 
      (71%) had a positive family history. We identified one patient (4.8% of the total 
      cohort) with an expansion of 81 combined CTA/CTG repeats at the SCA8 locus. This 
      falls within what is believed to be the high-penetrance allele range. In addition 
      to the classic HD triad, the patient had features of dystonia and oculomotor 
      apraxia. There were no cases of HDL2, SCA17, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA12 or DRPLA. 
      Given the controversy surrounding the SCA8 expansion, the present finding may be 
      incidental. However, if pathogenic, it broadens the phenotype that may be 
      associated with SCA8 expansions. The absence of any other mutations in our cohort 
      is not surprising, given the low probability of reaching a genetic diagnosis in 
      HD phenocopy patients.

TI  - Body mass index is inversely correlated with the expanded CAG repeat length in 
      SCA3/MJD patients.
PG  - 771-4
LID - 10.1007/s12311-011-0326-6 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), 
      is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder with no current treatment. We 
      aimed to evaluate the body mass index (BMI) of patients with SCA3/MJD and to 
      assess the correlations with clinical, molecular, biochemical, and neuroimaging 
      findings. A case-control study with 46 SCA3/MJD patients and 42 healthy, 
      non-related control individuals with similar age and sex was performed. Clinical 
      evaluation was done with the ataxia scales SARA and NESSCA. Serum insulin, 
      insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and magnetic resonance imaging normalized 
      volumetries of cerebellum and brain stem were also assessed. BMI was lower in 
      SCA3/MJD patients when compared to controls (p = 0.01). BMI was associated with 
      NESSCA, expanded CAG repeat number (CAG)n, age of onset, age, disease duration, 
      and serum insulin levels; however, in the linear regression model, (CAG)n was the 
      only variable independently associated with BMI, in an inverse manner 
      (R = -0.396, p = 0.015). In this report, we present evidence that low BMI is not 
      only present in SCA3/MJD, but is also directly related to the length of the 
      expanded CAG repeats, which is the causative mutation of the disease. This 
      association points that weight loss might be a primary disturbance of SCA3/MJD, 
      although further detailed analyses are necessary for a better understanding of 
      the nutritional deficit and its role in the pathophysiology of SCA3/MJD.

TI  - Parkinsonian phenotype in Machado-Joseph disease (MJD/SCA3): a two-case report.
PG  - 131
LID - 10.1186/1471-2377-11-131 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), or spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 
      (SCA3), is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder of late onset, which 
      is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of the ATXN3 gene. This 
      disease presents clinical heterogeneity, which cannot be completely explained by 
      the size of the repeat tract. MJD presents extrapyramidal motor signs, namely 
      parkinsonism, more frequently than the other subtypes of autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxias. Although parkinsonism seems to segregate within MJD families, 
      only a few MJD patients develop parkinsonian features and, therefore, the 
      clinical and genetic aspects of these rare presentations remain poorly 
      investigated. The main goal of this work was to describe two MJD patients 
      displaying the parkinsonian triad (tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity), namely on 
      what concerns genetic variation in Parkinson's disease (PD) associated loci 
      (PARK2, LRRK2, PINK1, DJ-1, SNCA, MAPT, APOE, and mtDNA tRNA(Gln) T4336C). CASE 
      PRESENTATION: Patient 1 is a 40 year-old female (onset at 30 years of age), 
      initially with a pure parkinsonian phenotype (similar to the phenotype previously 
      reported for her mother). Patient 2 is a 38 year-old male (onset at 33 years of 
      age), presenting an ataxic phenotype with parkinsonian features (not seen either 
      in other affected siblings or in his father). Both patients presented an expanded 
      ATXN3 allele with 72 CAG repeats. No PD mutations were found in the analyzed 
      loci. However, allelic variants previously associated with PD were observed in 
      DJ-1 and APOE genes, for both patients. CONCLUSIONS: The present report adds 
      clinical and genetic information on this particular and rare MJD presentation, 
      and raises the hypothesis that DJ-1 and APOE polymorphisms may confer 
      susceptibility to the parkinsonian phenotype in MJD.

TI  - Cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome in Machado Joseph disease: core clinical 
      features.
PG  - 549-56

AB  - The cerebellum is no longer considered a purely motor control device, and 
      convincing evidence has demonstrated its relationship to cognitive and emotional 
      neural circuits. The aims of the present study were to establish the core 
      cognitive features in our patient population and to determine the presence of 
      Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome (CCAS) in this group. We recruited 38 
      patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) or Machado-Joseph disease 
      (MJD)-SCA3/MJD and 31 controls. Data on disease status were recorded (disease 
      duration, age, age at onset, ataxia severity, and CAG repeat length). The 
      severity of cerebellar symptoms was measured using the International Cooperative 
      Ataxia Rating Scale and the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia. The 
      neuropsychological assessment consisted of the Mini-Mental State Examination, 
      Clock Drawing Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Rey-Osterrieth Complex 
      Figure, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Stroop Color-Word Test, Trail-Making Test, 
      Verbal Paired Associates, and verbal fluency tests. All subjects were also 
      submitted to the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Beck Depression Inventory. After 
      controlling for multiple comparisons, spatial span, picture completion, symbol 
      search, Stroop Color-Word Test, phonemic verbal fluency, and Trail-Making Tests A 
      and B were significantly more impaired in patients with SCA3/MJD than in 
      controls. Executive and visuospatial functions are impaired in patients with 
      SCA3/MJD, consistent with the symptoms reported in the CCAS. We speculate on a 
      possible role in visual cortical processing degeneration and executive 
      dysfunction in our patients as a model to explain their main cognitive deficit.

TI  - The modulation of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis risk by ataxin-2 intermediate 
      polyglutamine expansions is a specific effect.
PG  - 356-61
LID - 10.1016/j.nbd.2011.08.021 [doi]
AB  - Full expansions of the polyglutamine domain (polyQ>/=34) within the 
      polysome-associated protein ataxin-2 (ATXN2) are the cause of a multi-system 
      neurodegenerative disorder, which usually presents as a Spino-Cerebellar Ataxia 
      and is therefore known as SCA2, but may rarely manifest as Levodopa-responsive 
      Parkinson syndrome or as motor neuron disease. Intermediate expansions 
      (27</=polyQ</=33) were reported to modify the risk of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
      (ALS). We have now tested the reproducibility and the specificity of this 
      observation. In 559 independent ALS patients from Central Europe, the association 
      of ATXN2 expansions (30</=polyQ</=35) with ALS was highly significant. The study of 
      1490 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) showed an enrichment of ATXN2 alleles 
      27/28 in a subgroup with familial cases, but the overall risk of sporadic PD was 
      unchanged. No association was found between polyQ expansions in Ataxin-3 (ATXN3) 
      and ALS risk. These data indicate a specific interaction between ATXN2 expansions 
      and the causes of ALS, possibly through altered RNA-processing as a common 
      pathogenic factor.

TI  - The natural history of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, 2, 3, and 6: a 2-year 
      follow-up study.
PG  - 1035-41
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0b013e31822e7ca0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain quantitative data on the progression of the most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) and identify factors that influence their 
      progression, we initiated the EUROSCA natural history study, a multicentric 
      longitudinal cohort study of 526 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6. We 
      report the results of the 1- and 2-year follow-up visits. METHODS: As the primary 
      outcome measure we used the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA, 
      0-40), and as a secondary measure the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Symptoms (INAS, 
      0-16) count. RESULTS: The annual increase of the SARA score was greatest in SCA1 
      (2.18 +/- 0.17, mean +/- SE) followed by SCA3 (1.61 +/- 0.12) and SCA2 (1.40 +/- 0.11). 
      SARA progression in SCA6 was slowest and nonlinear (first year: 0.35 +/- 0.34, 
      second year: 1.44 +/- 0.34). Analysis of the INAS count yielded similar results. 
      Larger expanded repeats and earlier age at onset were associated with faster SARA 
      progression in SCA1 and SCA2. In SCA1, repeat length of the expanded allele had a 
      similar effect on INAS progression. In SCA3, SARA progression was influenced by 
      the disease duration at inclusion, and INAS progression was faster in females. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study gives a comprehensive quantitative account of disease 
      progression in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6 and identifies factors that 
      specifically affect disease progression.

TI  - CAG repeats mimic CUG repeats in the misregulation of alternative splicing.
PG  - 8938-51
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkr608 [doi]
AB  - Mutant transcripts containing expanded CUG repeats in the untranslated region are 
      a pathogenic factor in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). The mutant RNA sequesters 
      the muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) splicing factor and causes misregulation of the 
      alternative splicing of multiple genes that are linked to clinical symptoms of 
      the disease. In this study, we show that either long untranslated CAG repeat RNA 
      or short synthetic CAG repeats induce splicing aberrations typical of DM1. 
      Alternative splicing defects are also caused by translated CAG repeats in normal 
      cells transfected with a mutant ATXN3 gene construct and in cells derived from 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and Huntington's disease patients. Splicing 
      misregulation is unlikely to be caused by traces of antisense transcripts with 
      CUG repeats, and the possible trigger of this misregulation may be sequestration 
      of the MBNL1 protein with nuclear RNA inclusions containing expanded CAG repeat 
      transcripts. We propose that alternative splicing misregulation by mutant CAG 
      repeats may contribute to the pathological features of polyglutamine disorders.

TI  - Flanking domain stability modulates the aggregation kinetics of a polyglutamine 
      disease protein.
PG  - 1675-81
LID - 10.1002/pro.698 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3) is one of nine polyglutamine (polyQ) 
      diseases that are all characterized by progressive neuronal dysfunction and the 
      presence of neuronal inclusions containing aggregated polyQ protein, suggesting 
      that protein misfolding is a key part of this disease. Ataxin-3, the causative 
      protein of SCA3, contains a globular, structured N-terminal domain (the Josephin 
      domain) and a flexible polyQ-containing C-terminal tail, the repeat-length of 
      which modulates pathogenicity. It has been suggested that the fibrillogenesis 
      pathway of ataxin-3 begins with a non-polyQ-dependent step mediated by Josephin 
      domain interactions, followed by a polyQ-dependent step. To test the involvement 
      of the Josephin domain in ataxin-3 fibrillogenesis, we have created both 
      pathogenic and nonpathogenic length ataxin-3 variants with a stabilized Josephin 
      domain, and have both stabilized and destabilized the isolated Josephin domain. 
      We show that changing the thermodynamic stability of the Josephin domain 
      modulates ataxin-3 fibrillogenesis. These data support the hypothesis that the 
      first stage of ataxin-3 fibrillogenesis is caused by interactions involving the 
      non-polyQ containing Josephin domain and that the thermodynamic stability of this 
      domain is linked to the aggregation propensity of ataxin-3.

AB  - Machado-Joseph disease, or spinocerebellar ataxia type 3(MJD/SCA3), is the most 
      frequent late onset spinocerebellar ataxia and results from a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the ataxin-3 gene. Previous studies have found correlation between 
      atrophy of cerebellum and brainstem with age and CAG repeats, although no such 
      correlation has been found with disease duration and clinical manifestations. In 
      this study we test the hypothesis that atrophy of cerebellum and brainstem in 
      MJD/SCA3 is related to clinical severity, disease duration and CAG repeat length 
      as well as to other variables such as age and ICARS (International Cooperative 
      Ataxia Rating Scale). Whole brain high resolution MRI and volumetric measurement 
      with cranial volume normalization were obtained from 15 MJD/SCA3 patients and 15 
      normal, age and sex-matchedcontrols. We applied ICARS and compared the score with 
      volumes and CAG number, disease duration and age. We found significant 
      correlation of both brain stem and cerebellar atrophy with CAG repeat length, 
      age, disease duration and degree of disability. The Spearman rank correlation was 
      stronger with volumetric reduction of the cerebellum than with brain stem. Our 
      data allow us to conclude that volumetric analysis might reveal progressive 
      degeneration after disease onset, which in turn is linked to both age and number 
      of CAG repeat expansions in SCA 3.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a group of autosomal dominant 
      ataxias with varied clinical phenotypes. However there are no unique 
      distinguishing features on routine neuroimaging among the various genetically 
      defined SCAs. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) provides an automated unbiased 
      analysis of structural MRI scans and gives a comprehensive assessment of 
      anatomical differences throughout the brain. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study 
      were to (i) characterize the patterns of atrophy in SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3 using 
      optimized VBM, (ii) demonstrate the characteristic anatomical differences in 
      these genetically distinct SCA subtypes, and (iii) assess the relationship 
      between morphometric measures and the CAG repeat lengths and other attributes of 
      the disease. METHODS: Thirty-one genetically confirmed patients suffering from 
      SCA (SCA1 - 12, SCA2 - 9, and SCA3 - 10) were studied. High resolution 
      T1-weighted 3-Dimensional Magnetic Resonance Images of 31 patients were analyzed 
      using the optimized VBM procedure. RESULTS: In all the three SCAs there was a 
      significant loss of gray matter in both cerebellar hemispheres and vermis. 
      Vermian atrophy was more pronounced in SCA3, while SCA1 and SCA2 had significant 
      white matter atrophy. Pontine white matter atrophy was more pronounced in SCA2. 
      In SCA1, the severity of ataxia strongly correlated with the degree of gray 
      matter atrophy in cerebellar hemispheres. The duration of symptoms and lengths of 
      CAG repeats had no correlation with the degree of atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study showed that the different subtypes of SCAs may have morphometric 
      differences in the cerebellum, brainstem and the supratentorial structures.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) constitute a group of autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorders with no current treatment. The insulin/insulin-like 
      growth factor 1 (IGF-1) system (IIS) has been shown to play a role in the 
      neurological dysfunction of SCAs and other polyglutamine disorders. We aimed to 
      study the biomarker profile of serum IIS components in SCA3. We performed a 
      case-control study with 46 SCA3 patients and 42 healthy individuals evaluating 
      the peripheral IIS profile (insulin, IGF-1, IGFBP1 and 3) and the correlation 
      with clinical, molecular, and neuroimaging findings. SCA3 patients presented 
      lower insulin and IGFBP3 levels and higher insulin sensitivity (HOMA2), free 
      IGF-I, and IGFBP1 levels when compared with controls. IGFBP-1 levels were 
      directly associated with CAG expanded repeat length; IGF-1 was associated with 
      the volumetries of specific brainstem regions on magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI). Insulin levels and sensitivity were related to age at onset of symptoms. 
      Our findings indicate an involvement of IIS components in SCA3 neurobiology and 
      IGFBP-1 as a potential biomarker of the disease.

AB  - In polyglutamine disorders, the length of the expanded CAG repeat shows a strong 
      inverse correlation with the age at disease onset, yet up to 50% of the variation 
      in age of onset is determined by other additional factors. Here, we investigated 
      whether variations in the expression of heat shock proteins (HSP) are related to 
      differences in the age of onset in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)3. 
      Hereto, we analysed the protein expression levels of HSPA1A (HSP70), HSPA8 
      (HSC70), DNAJB (HSP40) and HSPB1 (HSP27) in fibroblasts from patients and healthy 
      controls. HSPB1 levels were significantly upregulated in fibroblasts from 
      patients with SCA3, but without relation to age of onset. Exclusively for 
      expression of DNAJB family members, a correlation was found with the age of onset 
      independent of the length of the CAG repeat expansion. This indicates that DNAJB 
      members might be contributors to the variation in age of onset and underlines the 
      possible use of DNAJB proteins as therapeutic targets.

TI  - Involvement of Onuf's nucleus in Machado-Joseph disease: a morphometric and 
      immunohistochemical study.
PG  - 439-48
LID - 10.1007/s00401-010-0699-5 [doi]
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in the MJD1 gene, in which lower urinary 
      tract dysfunction is known to be the most commonly encountered autonomic failure. 
      However, it remains unclear whether Onuf's nucleus (ON), which plays major roles 
      in the micturition reflex and voluntary continence, degenerates during the 
      disease process. In the present study, we conducted a morphometric and 
      immunohistochemical study of ON, together with the lateral nuclear group (LNG) of 
      the sacral anterior horns, in seven patients with MJD. When compared with 
      controls, the number of lower motor neurons in both ON and LNG was significantly 
      smaller in the MJD patients, the former being inversely correlated with the size 
      of the expanded CAG repeats. Notably, MJD patients with a large CAG-repeat 
      expansion showed an ON-predominant pattern of neuronal loss, while in the 
      remaining patients, ON and LNG were affected to a similar degree, or rather an 
      LNG-predominant pattern of neuronal loss was evident. Moreover, when adjusted for 
      age, the degree of neuronal loss in both ON and LNG was significantly correlated 
      with the extent of expansion of the CAG repeats. In MJD, the remaining lower 
      motor neurons in ON often exhibited ataxin-3- or 1C2-immunoreactive (ir) neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusions, while no pTDP-43-ir neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions were 
      present in these neurons. In conclusion, the present findings strongly suggest 
      that neuronal loss in ON, the degree of which is highly influenced by the extent 
      of expansion of CAG repeats, is a consistent feature in MJD.

AB  - Small heat-shock proteins (sHsps) are molecular chaperones that play an important 
      protective role against cellular protein misfolding by interacting with partially 
      unfolded proteins on their off-folding pathway, preventing their aggregation. 
      Polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion leads to the formation of fibrillar 
      protein aggregates and neuronal cell death in nine diseases, including Huntington 
      disease and the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). There is evidence that sHsps have 
      a role in suppression of polyQ-induced neurodegeneration; for example, the sHsp 
      alphaB-crystallin (alphaB-c) has been identified as a suppressor of SCA3 toxicity 
      in a Drosophila model. However, the molecular mechanism for this suppression is 
      unknown. In this study we tested the ability of alphaB-c to suppress the 
      aggregation of a polyQ protein. We found that alphaB-c does not inhibit the 
      formation of SDS-insoluble polyQ fibrils. We further tested the effect of 
      alphaB-c on the aggregation of ataxin-3, a polyQ protein that aggregates via a 
      two-stage aggregation mechanism. The first stage involves association of the 
      N-terminal Josephin domain followed by polyQ-mediated interactions and the 
      formation of SDS-resistant mature fibrils. Our data show that alphaB-c potently 
      inhibits the first stage of ataxin-3 aggregation; however, the second 
      polyQ-dependent stage can still proceed. By using NMR spectroscopy, we have 
      determined that alphaB-c interacts with an extensive region on the surface of the 
      Josephin domain. These data provide an example of a domain/region flanking an 
      amyloidogenic sequence that has a critical role in modulating aggregation of a 
      polypeptide and plays a role in the interaction with molecular chaperones to 
      prevent this aggregation.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 3 is an untreatable CAG repeat expansion disorder whose 
      natural history is not completely understood. Our aims were to describe the 
      progression of neurological manifestations in a long-term cohort of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 3, and to verify if CAG expanded repeat, gender, and age 
      at onset were associated with the rate of progression. Patients entered the study 
      between 1998 and 2005 and were seen until 2007. On each visit, the validated 
      NESSCA scale, an inventory of 18 neurological manifestations, was applied. Scores 
      observed in each year of disease duration produced a Growth Curve, which was 
      analyzed through the random coefficients model. Scores obtained in some 
      individual items were described through multi-state Markov models. One hundred 
      fifty-six patients (78 families) were recruited; 28 were lost, and 23 died. Mean 
      (sd) ages at onset and at baseline were 32.8 (10.6) and 40.7 (12.8) years; median 
      (range) expanded CAGn was 74 (67-85). Three hundred fifteen NESSCA evaluations 
      were performed, comprising disease durations from zero to 34 years. The 105 
      patients who completed the study were seen over 5 (sd = 2.4) years at intervals 
      of 2.5 (sd = 1.5) years. The trajectory of NESSCA obtained for the overall group 
      increased by 1.26 points per year. This slope increased by 0.15 points per each 
      additional CAG in the expanded repeat (p < 0.0002) and decreased by 0.03 points 
      per each additional year of age at onset (p = 0.005). NESSCA worsened steadily, 
      producing linear trajectories, which were faster among patients with longer 
      expanded repeats (>74) and with lower ages at onset (<34 years).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), caused by a CAG repeat expansion 
      located in exon10 of the ATXN3 gene, is now regarded as one of the most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) in the world. The relative frequency of MJD among 
      SCA has previously been estimated at about 50% in the Chinese population and has 
      been reported to be related to the frequency of large normal alleles in some 
      populations. Taq polymerase has been used for PCR in nearly all studies reported 
      previously. METHODS: Normal and expanded alleles of ATXN3 were detected via PCR 
      using LA Taq DNA polymerase (better for GC-rich sequences) and denaturing 
      polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 150 normal individuals and 138 unrelated 
      probands from autosomal dominant SCA families. To compare reaction efficiency, 12 
      MJD patients' expanded alleles were amplified with La Taq and Taq polymerase 
      respectively in the same amplifying systems and reaction conditions. RESULTS: 
      Normal alleles ranged from 12 to 42 CAG repeats. The most common allele contained 
      14 repeats with a frequency of 23.3%, which corroborates previous reports. The 
      frequency of large normal alleles (>27 repeats) was 0.28, which was very high 
      relative to previous reports. The frequency of MJD in SCA patients was 72.5%, 
      which was significantly higher than those in previous reports about the Chinese 
      and other Asian populations. This frequency was one of the highest reported 
      worldwide, with only Portuguese and Brazilian populations exhibiting higher 
      proportions. All 12 expanded alleles were amplified in PCR with La Taq 
      polymerase, whereas only 2 expanded alleles were amplified with Taq polymerase. 
      CONCLUSION: We have first reported the highest relative frequency of MJD in Asia, 
      and we attribute this high frequency to a more efficient PCR using LA Taq 
      polymerase and hypothesized that large ANs may act as a reservoir for expanded 
      alleles in the Southeastern Chinese population.

AB  - The diagnosis and incidence of spinocerebelar ataxias (SCA) is sometimes 
      difficult to analyze due the overlap of phenotypes subtypes and are disorders of 
      mutations caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion. To investigate the 
      incidence of the SCA in Southern Brazil, we analyzed the trinucleotide repeats 
      (CAG)n at the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7 loci to identify allele size ranges 
      and frequencies. We examined blood sample from 154 asymptomatic blood donors and 
      115 individuals with progressive ataxias. PCR products were submitted to 
      capillary electrophoresis. In the blood donors, the ranges of the five loci were: 
      SCA1, 19 to 36 (CAG)n; SCA2, 6 to 28 (CAG)n; SCA3, 12 to 34 (CAG)n; SCA6, 2 to 13 
      (CAG)n; and SCA7, 2 to 10 (CAG)n. No deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
      were detected. In the ataxia group, we found (CAG)n above the range of the 
      asymptomatic blood donors in SCA3 (21.74%) followed by SCA2 (5.22%), SCA7 
      (2.61%), SCA6 (0.87%), and no cases of SCA1. The remaining 80 cases (69.56%) have 
      different diagnoses from the type here studied. These data defined the alleles 
      and their frequencies, as well as demonstrated their stability in the population 
      not affected. The molecular diagnosis test confirmed the clinical diagnosis in 
      28/45 cases and classified another 7/70 from the clinical unclassified ataxias 
      group.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) and type 3 (SCA3) 
      are autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorders. HD is caused by polyglutamine 
      (polyQ) expansion (exp) in the amino-terminal region of a protein huntingtin 
      (Htt) and primarily affects medium spiny striatal neurons (MSN). SCA2 is caused 
      by a polyQ expansion in the amino-terminal region of a cytosolic protein ataxin-2 
      (Atxn2) and primarily affects cerebellar Purkinje neurons. SCA3 is caused by a 
      polyQ expansion in the carboxy-terminal portion of a cytosolic protein ataxin-3 
      (Atxn3) and primarily affects dentate and pontine nuclei and substantia nigra. 
      The reasons for neuronal dysfunction and death in HD, SCA2 and SCA3 remain poorly 
      understood and no cure is available for the patients. My laboratory discovered 
      that mutant Huntingtin, ataxin-2 and ataxin-3 proteins specifically binds to the 
      carboxy-terminal region of the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 
      (IP(3)R1), an intracellular Ca(2+) release channel. Moreover, we found that 
      association with IP(3)R1 causes sensitization of IP(3)R1 to activation by IP(3) 
      in planar lipid bilayers and in neuronal cells. These results suggested that 
      deranged neuronal Ca(2+) signaling might play an important role in pathogenesis 
      of HD, SCA2 and SCA3. In support of this idea, we demonstrated a connection 
      between abnormal Ca(2+) signaling and neuronal cell death in experimnts with HD, 
      SCA2 and SCA3 transgenic mouse models. Based on these results I propose that 
      IP(3)R and other Ca(2+) signaling proteins should be considered as potential 
      therapeutic targets for treatment of HD, SCA2 and SCA3.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathy (PN) has long been recognized in Machado-Joseph disease 
      (MJD), but its natural history is an unsettled issue. Therefore, we prospectively 
      assessed 40 with MJD for 13 months with nerve conduction (NC) studies and the 
      revised total neuropathy score (TNSr) to study the progression of PN. There was 
      no significant change in the TNSr score over the follow-up period. In contrast, 
      the average sural sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitude decreased 
      significantly over the same interval from a mean of 13.2 muV to 9.8 muV (P < 
      0.001). There was an inverse correlation between the change in the sural SNAP 
      amplitude and the length of the CAG triplet repeat expansion (r = 0.574, P < 
      0.001). The reduction in the mean sural SNAP amplitude also correlated with 
      progression of ataxia. This indicates that PN progresses faster in individuals 
      with larger (CAG)(n) expansions, and nerve conduction studies may be useful to 
      study disease progression in MJD.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), or Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), is caused 
      by the expansion of a polyglutamine repeat in the ataxin-3 protein. We generated 
      a mouse model of SCA3 expressing ataxin-3 with 148 CAG repeats under the control 
      of the huntingtin promoter, resulting in ubiquitous expression throughout the 
      whole brain. The model resembles many features of the disease in humans, 
      including a late onset of symptoms and CAG repeat instability in transmission to 
      offspring. We observed a biphasic progression of the disease, with hyperactivity 
      during the first months and decline of motor coordination after about 1 year of 
      age; however, intranuclear aggregates were not visible at this age. Few and small 
      intranuclear aggregates appeared first at the age of 18 months, further 
      supporting the claim that neuronal dysfunction precedes the formation of 
      intranuclear aggregates.

TI  - Analysis of SCA2 and SCA3/MJD repeats in Parkinson's disease in mainland China: 
      genetic, clinical, and positron emission tomography findings.

AB  - To investigate the prevalence and clinical feature(s) of Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      patients with expanded (ATXN2 and MJD1) genes of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      and 3 (SCA2 and SCA3/MJD) in a mainland Chinese population, CAG triplet repeat 
      expansions of (SCA2 and SCA3/MJD) genes (ATXN2 and MJD1) were analyzed in a 
      cohort of 452 PD patients, including 386 sporadic and 66 familial forms. Striatal 
      dopamine transporter was evaluated in two SCA2 and two SCA3/MJD-positive family 
      members, an idiopathic PD patient and a healthy control using carbon (C11) 
      [(11)C]-radiolabeled-CFT positron emission tomography (PET). We found two 
      patients in one familial PD (FPD) family (1.5%) and two sporadic PD patients 
      (0.5%) with expanded CAG repeats in the ATXN2 locus, four patients in two FPD 
      families (3%) and another three sporadic PD patients (0.8%) in the MJD1 locus. 
      [(11)C]-CFT PET in detected members in SCA2 and SCA3/MJD families showed 
      decrements of (11)C-CFT uptake. These findings suggest that a mutation in SCA2 or 
      SCA3/MJD may be one of the genetic causes of PD.

TI  - Visualization, quantification and correlation of brain atrophy with clinical 
      symptoms in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 3 and 6.
PG  - 158-68
LID - 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.07.027 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Biomarkers to monitor neurological dysfunction in 
      autosomal dominant inherited spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are lacking. We 
      therefore aimed to visualize, quantify and correlate localized brain atrophy with 
      clinical symptoms in SCA1, SCA3, and SCA6. METHODS: We compared patients 
      suffering from SCA1 (n=48), SCA3 (n=24), and SCA6 (n=10) with 32 controls using 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on four different scanners in eight centers 
      followed by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and quantitative three-dimensional (3D) 
      volumetry. RESULTS: SCA1 and SCA3 patients presented with severe atrophy in total 
      brainstem (consisting of midbrain, pons, and medulla), pons, medulla, total 
      cerebellum, cerebellar hemispheres and cerebellar vermis, putamen and caudate 
      nucleus. Atrophy in the cerebellar hemispheres was less severe in SCA3 than in 
      SCA1 and SCA6. Atrophy in SCA6 was restricted to the grey matter of the 
      cerebellum (VBM and volumetry), total brainstem and pons (volumetry only). 
      Overall, we did not observe substantial atrophy in the cerebral cortex. A 
      discriminant analysis taking into account data from pons, cerebellar hemispheres, 
      medulla, midbrain and putamen achieved a reclassification probability of 81.7% 
      for SCA1, SCA3, and SCA6. The repeat length of the expanded allele showed a weak 
      negative correlation with the volume of the brainstem, pons, caudate nucleus and 
      putamen in SCA3, and a weak correlation with the pons in SCA1, whereas no such 
      correlation was found in SCA6. Clinical dysfunction as measured by the Scale for 
      the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and the Unified Huntington's Disease 
      Rating Scale functional assessment correlated best with the atrophy of pons in 
      SCA1, with total brainstem atrophy in SCA3 and atrophy of total cerebellum in 
      SCA6. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide strong evidence that MRI is an attractive 
      surrogate marker for clinical studies of SCA. In each SCA genotype clinical 
      dysfunction may be caused by different patho-anatomical processes.

TI  - Six cases of SCA3/MJD patients that mimic hereditary spastic paraplegia in 
      clinic.
PG  - 121-4
LID - 10.1016/j.jns.2009.06.027 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is an 
      autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by cerebellar ataxia 
      associated with varying phenotypic variability. It was reported that a few of 
      SCA3/MJD patients showed marked spastic paraplegia with or without cerebellar 
      ataxia, which was partially first diagnosed as hereditary spastic paraplegia 
      (HSP) and considered to be a new subtype (subtype V). But the data in China is 
      still absent. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mutation frequency and clinical 
      features of subtype V of SCA3/MJD in Chinese patients with HSP. METHODS: Mutation 
      detection of MJD1 gene was carried out in 46 AD-HSP families and 58 sporadic 
      cases. RESULTS: Expanded CAG repeats that ranged from 64 to 81 of MJD1 gene were 
      found in six probands from 46 AD-HSP families (13%, 6/46). No abnormal repeat 
      expansion was found in sporadic cases (0/58). The initial symptoms of six SCA3 
      cases were all spasticity in the lower limbs, and nystagmus, dysphagia and 
      dysarthria that occurred with disease progression seemed more frequent than HSP. 
      CONCLUSION: Subtype V of SCA3/MJD is not rare in China, but it is hard to 
      distinguish between HSP and SCA3/MJD only by clinical manifestation and MRI, and 
      MJD1 gene should be detected routinely in the patients diagnosed as HSP in 
      clinic.

AB  - PURPOSE: The lengths of CAG repeats in two spinocerebellar ataxia genes, SCA1 and 
      SCA3, were analyzed to determine whether such repeats exist in higher numbers in 
      infertile males. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from healthy controls, 
      oligozoospermia patients, and azoospermia patients. DNA fragments containing 
      target CAG repeats were amplified by PCR with template DNA purified from the 
      blood samples. CAG repeats in PCR fragments were determined, using ABI PRISM 310 
      Gene Analyzer. RESULTS: In SCA1, the distribution of CAG repeats in 
      oligozoospermic males was different from that of the control group: More alleles 
      had a repeat number that exceeded 32. Conversely, for SCA3, the examined 
      oligozoospermia and azoospermia patients exhibited no differences in distribution 
      of CAG repeats in comparison with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: SCA1 in a 
      subset of oligozoospermia patients has an increased number of CAG repeats.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0005834 [doi]
LID - e5834
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3, also known as Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD), is one 
      of many inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by polyglutamine-encoding 
      CAG repeat expansions in otherwise unrelated genes. Disease protein misfolding 
      and aggregation, often within the nucleus of affected neurons, characterize 
      polyglutamine disorders. Several evidences have implicated the nucleus as the 
      primary site of pathogenesis for MJD. However, the molecular determinants for the 
      nucleocytoplasmic transport of human ataxin-3 (Atx3), the protein which is 
      mutated in patients with MJD, are not characterized. In order to characterize the 
      nuclear shuttling activity of Atx3, we performed yeast nuclear import assays and 
      found that Atx3 is actively imported into the nucleus, by means of a classical 
      nuclear localizing sequence formed by a cluster of lysine and arginine residues. 
      On the other hand, when active nuclear export was inhibited using leptomycin B, a 
      specific inhibitor of the nuclear export receptor CRM1, both endogenous Atx3 and 
      transfected GFP-Atx3 accumulated inside the nucleus of a subpopulation of COS-7 
      cells, whereas both proteins are normally predominant in the cytoplasm. 
      Additionally, using a Rev(1.4)-GFP nuclear export assay, we performed an 
      extensive analysis of six putative aliphatic nuclear export motifs identified in 
      Atx3 amino acid sequence. Although none of the tested peptide sequences were 
      found to drive nuclear export when isolated, we have successfully mapped the 
      region of Atx3 responsible for its CRM1-independent nuclear export activity. 
      Curiously, the N-terminal Josephin domain alone is exported into the cytoplasm, 
      but the nuclear export activity of Atx3 is significantly enhanced in a longer 
      construct that is truncated after the two ubiquitin interaction motifs, upstream 
      from the polyQ tract. Our data show that Atx3 is actively imported to and 
      exported from the cell nucleus, and that its nuclear export activity is dependent 
      on a motif located at its N-terminal region. Since pathological Atx3 aggregates 
      in the nucleus of affected neurons in MJD, and there is in vivo evidence that 
      nuclear localization of Atx3 is required for the manifestation of symptoms in 
      MJD, defects in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity of the protein may be 
      involved in the nuclear accumulation and aggregation of expanded Atx3.

      expanded CAG repeats in mRNAs.

AB  - Expanded trinucleotide repeats cause many neurological diseases. These include 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) and Huntington's disease (HD), which are caused by 
      expanded CAG repeats within an allele of the ataxin-3 (ATXN3) and huntingtin 
      (HTT) genes, respectively. Silencing expression of these genes is a promising 
      therapeutic strategy, but indiscriminate inhibition of both the mutant and 
      wild-type alleles may lead to toxicity, and allele-specific approaches have 
      required polymorphisms that differ among individuals. We report that peptide 
      nucleic acid and locked nucleic acid antisense oligomers that target CAG repeats 
      can preferentially inhibit mutant ataxin-3 and HTT protein expression in cultured 
      cells. Duplex RNAs were less selective than single-stranded oligomers. The 
      activity of the peptide nucleic acids does not involve inhibition of 
      transcription, and differences in mRNA secondary structure or the number of 
      oligomer binding sites may be important. Antisense oligomers that discriminate 
      between wild-type and mutant genes on the basis of repeat length may offer new 
      options for developing treatments for MJD, HD and related hereditary diseases.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias types 1, 2 and 3: age adjusted clinical severity of 
      disease at presentation correlates with size of CAG repeat lengths.
PG  - 83-6
LID - 10.1016/j.jns.2008.10.016 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the correlation, if any, 
      between the clinical rate of disease progression at presentation with the CAG 
      repeat size in patients with spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 2 and 3 (SCA1, SCA2 and 
      SCA3). METHODS: The severity of ataxia was measured using the International 
      Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (IARS) in 31 patients of SCA1 (mean+/-SD age: 
      35.1+/-12.6 years; age at onset (AAO): 29.9+/-10.7 years), 25 patients of SCA2 
      (age: 34.9+/-14.9 years; AAO: 29.7+/-14.0 years) and 15 patients of SCA3 (age: 
      40.9+/-8.6 years; AAO: 36.9+/-10.1). The rate of disease progression at 
      presentation was measured by the age adjusted IARS (IARS/Age). For each SCA, 
      correlations of AAO, raw scores of IARS, age adjusted IARS and duration adjusted 
      IARS (IARS/Duration) with the CAG repeat size were determined. RESULTS: The 
      number of CAG repeats of the abnormal allele ranged from 42 to 67 in SCA1, 38 to 
      66 in SCA2, and 69 to 79 in SCA3. In all the three types of SCAs, there were 
      significant inverse correlations of AAO with CAG repeat size (SCA1: r=-0.9, 
      p<0.0001; SCA2: r=-0.7, p<0.0001; SCA3:-0.8, p=0.0003) and significant positive 
      correlations of IARS/Age with CAG repeat size (SCA1: r=0.6, p=0.0015; SCA2: 
      r=0.9, p<0.0001; SCA3:0.7, p=0.0057). However, the raw IARS scores and the 
      duration adjusted IARS scores did not correlate significantly with the CAG repeat 
      sizes. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the rate of clinical disease 
      progression at presentation, especially in SCA2, is dependent on the CAG repeat 
      size, and may commence linearly from birth.

TI  - Intrafamilial variability of Parkinson phenotype in SCAs: novel cases due to SCA2 
      and SCA3 expansions.
PG  - 374-8
LID - 10.1016/j.parkreldis.2008.09.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) has been related to mutations associated 
      with spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA); the frequency of the diagnosis of these 
      mutations is low in general late-onset PD cases. Our aim was to investigate a 
      selected high-risk group of PD patients. METHODS: PD patients with autosomal 
      dominant inheritance or atypical neurological manifestations were enrolled, 
      underwent a full neurological examination and had the CAG tracts of their SCA1, 
      2, 3, 6 and 7 genes analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 23 studied families, two SCA3 and 
      one SCA2 cases were identified. All had autosomal dominant inheritance. In the 
      SCA2 pedigree, four affected sibs had a homogeneous PD phenotype. CAG repeats 
      varied between 35 and 44 with CAA interruptions. Intrafamilial phenotypic 
      heterogeneity was identified in the SCA3 pedigrees; parkinsonian and ataxic 
      phenotypes coexisted in both kindreds. CAGn varied between 69 and 71 repeats. Age 
      of onset was lower in the SCA3 patients than in the remaining 24 cases (38 versus 
      46.7+/-12 years of age, p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: SCA2 and SCA3 mutations were 
      detected in 13% of the present sample: the strategy of selecting a high-risk 
      group increased the rate of making these diagnoses. The SCA2 cases confirmed an 
      association between PD and interrupted expansions, as well as PD intrafamilial 
      phenotypic homogeneity. Clinical heterogeneity of SCA3 pedigrees suggests that 
      disease-modifying agents outside the MJD1 gene may play a role in determining PD 
      symptoms in this disorder.

AB  - Onset of genetically determined neurodegenerative diseases is difficult to 
      specify because of their insidious and slowly progressive nature. This is 
      especially true for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) because of varying affection of 
      many parts of the nervous system and huge variability of symptoms. We 
      investigated early symptoms in 287 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 and 
      calculated the influence of CAG repeat length on age of onset depending on (1) 
      the definition of disease onset, (2) people defining onset, and (3) duration of 
      symptoms. Gait difficulty was the initial symptom in two-thirds of patients. 
      Double vision, dysarthria, impaired hand writing, and episodic vertigo preceded 
      ataxia in 4% of patients, respectively. Frequency of other early symptoms did not 
      differ from controls and was regarded unspecific. Data about disease onset varied 
      between patients and relatives for 1 year or more in 44% of cases. Influence of 
      repeat length on age of onset was maximum when onset was defined as beginning of 
      permanent gait disturbance and cases with symptoms for more than 10 years were 
      excluded. Under these conditions, CAG repeat length determined 64% of onset 
      variability in SCA1, 67% in SCA2, 46% in SCA3, and 41% in SCA6 demonstrating 
      substantial influence of nonrepeat factors on disease onset in all SCA subtypes. 
      Identification of these factors is of interest as potential targets for disease 
      modifying compounds. In this respect, recognition of early symptoms that develop 
      before onset of ataxia is mandatory to determine the shift from presymptomatic to 
      affected status in SCA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that determine disease severity and clinical 
      phenotype of the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), we studied 526 
      patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3. or SCA6. METHODS: To measure the severity of 
      ataxia we used the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). In 
      addition, nonataxia symptoms were assessed with the Inventory of Non-Ataxia 
      Symptoms (INAS). The INAS count denotes the number of nonataxia symptoms in each 
      patient. RESULTS: An analysis of covariance with SARA score as dependent variable 
      and repeat lengths of the expanded and normal allele, age at onset, and disease 
      duration as independent variables led to multivariate models that explained 60.4% 
      of the SARA score variance in SCA1, 45.4% in SCA2, 46.8% in SCA3, and 33.7% in 
      SCA6. In SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3, SARA was mainly determined by repeat length of the 
      expanded allele, age at onset, and disease duration. The only factors determining 
      the SARA score in SCA6 were age at onset and disease duration. The INAS count was 
      5.0 +/- 2.3 in SCA1, 4.6 +/- 2.2 in SCA2, 5.2 +/- 2.5 in SCA3, and 2.0 +/- 1.7 in 
      SCA6. In SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3, SARA score and disease duration were the strongest 
      predictors of the INAS count. In SCA6, only age at onset and disease duration had 
      an effect on the INAS count. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) 1, SCA2, and SCA3 share a number of common biologic properties, 
      whereas SCA6 is distinct in that its phenotype is more determined by age than by 
      disease-related factors.

TI  - Spinal cord atrophy in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and 6 : impact on clinical 
      disability.
PG  - 1244-9
LID - 10.1007/s00415-008-0907-6 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To quantify spinal cord atrophy and its impact on clinical disability 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 3 and 6. METHODS: Atrophy of the upper 
      spinal cord was assessed by high resolution T1-weighted MRI of patients with SCA3 
      (n = 14) and SCA6 (n = 10). Furthermore, two groups of age- and sex-matched 
      healthy control subjects (n = 24,) corresponding to the two SCA groups, were 
      studied. Images were post-processed by a semi-automated volumetry method 
      combining a marker based segmentation and an automatic histogram method 
      facilitating highly reliable quantification and morphometry of the upper cervical 
      cord in vivo. RESULTS: We found a significant reduction of normalized mean 
      crosssectional area of the spinal cord in SCA3 (p < 0.0005), whereas in SCA6 
      patients normalized mean crosssectional area was in the normal range (p = 0.379). 
      No correlation was found between spinal cord atrophy and disease duration as well 
      as CAG repeat length in both subtypes. In SCA6 a negative dependency between 
      clinical disability, as expressed by the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating 
      Scale as a well established ataxia score, and the mean cross-sectional area was 
      found (p = 0.02). A similar correlation was observed in SCA3 but did not reach 
      statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Our results quantify for the first time in 
      vivo spinal cord atrophy as a non-cerebellar neurodegenerative process in SCA3. 
      Our results suggest MR volumetry of the upper cervical cord as a marker of 
      functional importance in SCA3 and SCA6.

TI  - RNA toxicity is a component of ataxin-3 degeneration in Drosophila.
PG  - 1107-11
LID - 10.1038/nature06909 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a class of dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative disorders caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat encoding 
      glutamine within the coding region of the respective genes. The molecular and 
      cellular pathways underlying polyQ-induced neurodegeneration are the focus of 
      much research, and it is widely considered that toxic activities of the protein, 
      resulting from the abnormally long polyQ tract, cause pathogenesis. Here we 
      provide evidence for a pathogenic role of the CAG repeat RNA in polyQ toxicity 
      using Drosophila. In a Drosophila screen for modifiers of polyQ degeneration 
      induced by the spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) protein ataxin-3, we isolated 
      an upregulation allele of muscleblind (mbl), a gene implicated in the RNA 
      toxicity of CUG expansion diseases. Further analysis indicated that there may be 
      a toxic role of the RNA in polyQ-induced degeneration. We tested the role of the 
      RNA by altering the CAG repeat sequence to an interrupted CAACAG repeat within 
      the polyQ-encoding region; this dramatically mitigated toxicity. In addition, 
      expression of an untranslated CAG repeat of pathogenic length conferred neuronal 
      degeneration. These studies reveal a role for the RNA in polyQ toxicity, 
      highlighting common components in RNA-based and polyQ-protein-based trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion diseases.

TI  - Electrophysiology in spinocerebellar ataxias: spread of disease and 
      characteristic findings.
PG  - 198-203
LID - 10.1007/s12311-008-0024-1 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) comprise a clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorders 
      affecting the cerebellum and to variable degrees further parts of the nervous 
      system. Electrophysiology is a potent tool to prove impairment of multiple 
      neuronal systems and fibre tracts and even to decipher subclinical affection. 
      Electrooculography, evoked potentials, nerve conduction studies and 
      polysomnography are especially helpful in the setting of SCAs. Severely slowed 
      saccades are a hallmark of SCA2. Vertical nystagmus occurs most frequently in 
      SCA3 and SCA6. Visual potentials recede especially in SCA7. Substantially 
      prolonged central motor conduction times in motor-evoked potentials occur 
      frequently in SCA1 even in patients without clinical signs of pyramidal 
      affection. Thus, electrophysiological analyses may help to predict the SCA 
      genotype and direct molecular genetic diagnostics. Polysomnography is a helpful 
      tool in the analysis of sleep disorders and frequently helps to decipher 
      treatable causes like periodic leg movement in sleep and REM sleep behaviour 
      disorder in SCAs. Nerve conduction studies reveal sensory neuropathy in all 
      common SCA subtypes, but to variable degrees. Age rather than CAG repeat length 
      appears to be the most important determinant for neuropathy and makes sensory 
      nerve action potentials a potential progression marker in SCA.

TI  - Muscle excitability abnormalities in Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 525-9
LID - 10.1001/archneur.65.4.525 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the frequency of and to characterize muscle excitability 
      abnormalities in Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). DESIGN: Machado-Joseph disease is 
      a common autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia caused by an unstable CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion. Muscle cramps and fasciculations are frequent and 
      sometimes disabling manifestations. However, their frequency and 
      pathophysiological mechanisms remain largely unknown. Symptomatic patients with 
      MJD (hereinafter MJD patients) with molecular confirmation were assessed 
      prospectively. A standard questionnaire addressing clinical features of muscle 
      cramps and fasciculations was used. The Cramps Disability Scale was used to 
      quantify cramps-related disability. Patients underwent neurophysiological testing 
      with routine techniques. F waves of the right median nerves were obtained, and 
      persistence indexes were calculated. Four muscles (deltoid, first dorsal 
      interossei, tibialis anterior, and vastus lateralis) were examined by needle 
      electromyography. A semiquantitative scale (from 0 [no activity] to 4 [continuous 
      activity]) was used to determine the frequency of rest fasciculations in each 
      muscle. RESULTS: Fifty MJD patients (29 men) were included in the study. Their 
      mean age at examination was 46.3 years, their mean age at onset of the disease 
      was 35 years, and the mean duration of disease was 11.2 years. Abnormal CAG(n) 
      varied from 59 to 75 repeats. Forty-one patients presented with muscle cramps; in 
      10, this was their first symptom. The frequency of cramps varied between 1 and 90 
      episodes a week. For 15 patients, cramps were the chief complaint, frequently 
      disturbing sleep or work (Cramps Disability Scale score, 2 or 3). Lower limbs 
      were affected in 37 individuals, but unusual regions, such as the face and 
      abdominal muscles, were also involved. Fasciculations were found in 25 
      individuals; in 8 patients, they included facial muscles. However, fasciculations 
      were not a significant complaint for any of these patients. The clinical and 
      neurophysiological profile of MJD patients with and without cramps was not 
      significantly different. However, MJD patients with fasciculations had more 
      severe damage to their peripheral nerves. CONCLUSIONS: Muscle excitability 
      abnormalities were found in 41 MJD patients (82%), and they were the presenting 
      complaint in 10 (20%). They are related to altered excitability of peripheral 
      motor axons, but mechanisms underlying cramps and fasciculations are possibly 
      distinct in MJD patients.

TI  - Striatal and nigral pathology in a lentiviral rat model of Machado-Joseph 
      disease.
PG  - 2071-83
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddn106 [doi]
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is a fatal, dominant neurodegenerative disorder. MJD 
      results from polyglutamine repeat expansion in the MJD-1 gene, conferring a toxic 
      gain of function to the ataxin-3 protein. In this study, we aimed at 
      overexpressing ataxin-3 in the rat brain using lentiviral vectors (LV), to 
      generate an in vivo MJD genetic model and, to study the disorder in defined brain 
      regions: substantia nigra, an area affected in MJD, cortex and striatum, regions 
      not previously reported to be affected in MJD. LV encoding mutant or wild-type 
      human ataxin-3 was injected in the brain of adult rats and the animals were 
      tested for behavioral deficits and neuropathological abnormalities. Striatal 
      pathology was confirmed in transgenic mice and human tissue. In substantia nigra, 
      unilateral overexpression of mutant ataxin-3 led to: apomorphine-induced turning 
      behavior; formation of ubiquitinated ataxin-3 aggregates; alpha-synuclein 
      immunoreactivity; and loss of dopaminergic markers (TH and VMAT2). No 
      neuropathological changes were observed upon wild-type ataxin-3 overexpression. 
      Mutant ataxin-3 expression in striatum and cortex, resulted in accumulation of 
      misfolded ataxin-3, and within striatum, loss of neuronal markers. Striatal 
      pathology was confirmed by observation in MJD transgenic mice of ataxin-3 
      aggregates and substantial reduction of DARPP-32 immunoreactivity and, in human 
      striata, by ataxin-3 inclusions, immunoreactive for ubiquitin and 
      alpha-synuclein. This study demonstrates the use of LV encoding mutant ataxin-3 
      to produce a model of MJD and brings evidence of striatal pathology, suggesting 
      that this region may contribute to dystonia and chorea observed in some MJD 
      patients and may represent a target for therapies.

AB  - The sequencing procedure has been used to determine the size of the CAG repeat 
      expansion for the diagnosis of genetic disorders. Likewise, standard polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) and gel electrophoresis techniques are applied for screening 
      large number of patients. The trinucleotide repeats (TNR) region amplification by 
      means of the PCR procedure was initially performed using 32-P end-labelled 
      primers and currently carried out with fluorescently end-labelled primers. The 
      goal to obtain reliable TNR quantification assays, at low cost and short assay 
      times, represents a challenge for the molecular diagnosis aimed at massive 
      screening of affected populations. In the current work, we obtained preliminary 
      results of a new methodology for the detection and size estimation of CAG 
      expanded alleles. The assay was based on an indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent 
      assay (ELISA) for quantifying the amount of labelled cytidines in DNA molecules. 
      The label, 6-(p-bromobenzamido)caproyl radical, was introduced by the 
      transamination and acylation reactions. A group of model sequences containing 
      different numbers of CAG repeats, as well as the ATXN3 (ataxin 3) gene (from 
      subjects suffering type 3 spinocerebellar ataxia SCA3) were used for assay 
      standardization. The assay is simple, inexpensive, and easy to perform and 
      differentiates distinct degrees of CAG expansions.

TI  - Molecular analysis of CAG repeats at five different spinocerebellar ataxia loci: 
      correlation and alternative explanations for disease pathogenesis.
PG  - 338-42
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are caused by expansion of (CAG)n triplet repeats. 
      These repeats occur as polymorphic forms in general population; however, beyond a 
      threshold size they become pathogenic. The sizes and distributions of repeats at 
      the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA7 and DRPLA loci were assessed by molecular analysis of 
      124 unrelated ataxia patients and 44 controls, and the association of larger 
      normal (LN) alleles with disease prevalence was evaluated. Triplet repeat 
      expansions in the disease range were detected in 8% (10/124) of the cases, with 
      the majority having expansion at the SCA1 locus. Normal allele ranges in the 
      cohort studied were similar to the Caucasian and North Indian populations but 
      differed from the Korean and Japanese populations at various loci. The percentage 
      of individuals with LN alleles at the SCA1 and SCA2 loci was higher than reported 
      in Indians, Japanese and Caucasians. LN alleles showed a good correlation with 
      the incidence of SCA1, indicating that SCA1 is the most prevalent ataxia in our 
      population. The majority of cases with clinical symptoms of SCA could not be 
      diagnosed by established CAG repeat criteria, suggesting that there may be an 
      alternative basis for disease pathogenesis: (i) Repeats lower than the normal 
      range may also result in abnormal phenotypes (ii) LN alleles at different loci in 
      the same individual may contribute to symptoms (iii) Exogenous factors may play a 
      role in triggering disease symptoms in individuals with LN alleles (iv) Triplet 
      repeats may reach the disease range in the brain but not in the blood.

TI  - Chronic pain in Machado-Joseph disease: a frequent and disabling symptom.
PG  - 1767-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is one of the most common forms of 
      neurodegenerative ataxia characterized by remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity. 
      Although patients frequently report pain, systematic evaluation of this clinical 
      feature is lacking. OBJECTIVES: To compare the frequency of chronic pain among 
      patients with genetically confirmed MJD, an age- and sex-matched healthy control 
      group, and a disease control group of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (ALS). METHODS: We included 70 patients with MJD, 20 patients with ALS, and 70 
      control subjects from 2 clinical centers. All individuals underwent assessment 
      with a standardized pain questionnaire. In addition, we used a visual analog 
      scale to quantify pain intensity. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients with MJD (47%), 
      3 patients with ALS (15%), and 6 controls (9%) reported chronic pain. Lower back 
      pain preceded ataxia in 6 patients with MJD. Twenty-nine patients with MJD had 
      daily pain, which was continuous in 23. The mean visual analog scale score was 
      6.1 in patients with MJD. Pain was musculoskeletal in 26 patients with MJD, 
      dystonic in 2, neuropathic in 2, and mixed in 3. Typically, pain was lumbar (n = 
      17) or in the lower limbs (n = 15). We did not find significant differences 
      regarding duration of disease, sex, or severity of ataxia among patients with MJD 
      with and without chronic pain. Expanded (CAG)(n) tandem repeats were longer in 
      patients with MJD who experienced chronic pain (67.3 vs 65.2; P = .04). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In our series, pain was significantly more frequent in patients with 
      MJD than in controls. Chronic pain was a frequent and often disabling complaint 
      among patients with MJD. The lower back was the most frequently reported location 
      of pain in patients with MJD.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias type 1, 2 and 3: a study of heart rate variability.
PG  - 337-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect cardiac autonomic dysfunction, using analysis of heart rate 
      variability in genetically defined spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA). MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Consecutive RR intervals were analyzed for time- and frequency-domain 
      parameters in 22 genotypically proven SCA patients (SCA1 = 11, SCA2 = 6 and SCA3 
      = 5) and compared with that of age- and gender-matched controls. RESULTS: 
      Reduction in the standard deviation of RR interval (RR_SD) was seen in 72.7% of 
      SCA patients. There was a reduction in both the parasympathetic and sympathetic 
      parameters in SCA without any change in the ratio of low- to high-frequency 
      power. In SCA1, there was a significant negative correlation between RR_SD and 
      duration of illness but not with the CAG repeat lengths of the abnormal allele. 
      Small sample size of SCA2 and SCA3 precluded similar comparison. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Cardiac autonomic dysfunction, predominantly parasympathetic, was seen in SCA, 
      and the severity correlated with the duration of illness in SCA1.

TI  - Case control analysis of repeat expansion size in ataxia.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurological diseases. The expansion of unstable microsatellite 
      repeats has been identified as the underlying pathogenic cause of 10 subtypes of 
      autosomal dominant SCAs. The aetiology of sporadic SCA is unknown. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effect of large normal repeats in patients 
      presenting with sporadic or familial ataxia compared to a control population. The 
      size of the expansion was determined using a fluorescent PCR approach in 10 
      common SCA genes: SCA-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 (CACNA1A), 
      SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), SCA-17 (TBP) 
      and DRPLA (ATN1), in 165 ataxia patients and 307 controls of Welsh origin. There 
      was no difference between cases and controls in the distribution of the large 
      normal alleles, or in the distribution of the combined CAG repeats. The normal 
      allele distribution in the Welsh population was largely similar to that of other 
      Caucasian populations. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of large normal 
      repeats on the susceptibility to develop ataxia.

TI  - Cis-acting factors promoting the CAG intergenerational instability in 
      Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 439-46
AB  - In repeat expansion disorders, the size of pathological alleles is the most 
      relevant factor accounting for the disease severity and age-at-onset, emphasizing 
      the clinical significance of their underlying intergenerational instability. In 
      one of these diseases, Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), the sex of transmitting 
      progenitor and the C(987)GG/G(987)GG polymorphism are the best studied factors 
      acting on intergenerational instability of expanded alleles. Here, we assessed 
      the influence of other cis and inter-allelic acting factors, at the ATXN3 locus, 
      through the analysis of MJD lineages, flanking STR-based haplotypes, the initial 
      repeat size and parental age. A total of 100 transmissions of the expanded MJD 
      allele were analyzed according to the sex of the transmitting parent. We have 
      shown that independent origin mutations (identified by intragenic SNP-based 
      haplotypes) behave differently, as the status of instability (contraction, no 
      change or further expansion) is concerned. Indeed, 72% of expansions were 
      associated to the worldwide spread TTACAC lineage, whereas the GTGGCA displayed 
      75% of all contractions observed. The analysis of flanking recombinant haplotypes 
      did not suggest any further distant cis elements acting up- or downstream the 
      ATXN3 locus. Considering the increased amplitude of expansions seen in older 
      transmitting fathers, a repair-based mechanism may be suggested for the meiotic 
      instability at this locus; furthermore, the lack of correlation between the 
      initial repeat size and degree of instability did not support a replication-based 
      mechanism. In summary, our findings point to different mechanisms of instability 
      underlying male and female meioses, as well as contraction and expansion 
      processes in MJD.

TI  - Genetic analysis of SCA 2 and 3 repeat expansions in essential tremor and 
      atypical Parkinsonism.
PG  - 1971-4
AB  - Anecdotal reports suggest that patients with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA 2) 
      patients can present with postural tremor with ataxia. We determined the 
      prevalence of SCA2 and SCA3 mutations in a cohort of ET and atypical Parkinsonism 
      patients. A total of 277 subjects comprising of 177 ET and 100 atypical 
      Parkinsonism were examined. We identified one positive case of SCA3 among those 
      who were diagnosed with ET, yielding a prevalence of 0.5%, but a zero prevalence 
      among our atypical Parkinsonism patients. No study subjects carried an abnormal 
      SCA2 repeat expansion. Our study highlights that SCA3 can present initially with 
      ET symptoms, expanding the spectrum of genetic diseases that can be associated 
      with ET-like phenotype. Routine screening for SCA2 and SCA3 in ET and atypical 
      Parkinsonism patients may not be cost effective. However, in the long-term 
      follow-up of patients who present with an ET phenotype, clinicians should be 
      vigilant for other neurological signs, which may be point to an alternate 
      diagnosis.

TI  - Expansion of HIV-1 screening and anti-retroviral treatment programs in a 
      resource-poor setting: results from a faith-based organization in Jos, Plateau 
      State, Nigeria.
PG  - 93-100
AB  - BACKGROUND: Until recently, availability of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in 
      Nigeria has been limited to government and university based programs. Through the 
      United States' President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), additional 
      funding has become available for the treatment of HIV-positive patients. 
      OBJECTIVE: To report the expansion of HIV-1 screening, enrollment in an ART 
      program, and treatment outcomes over twelve months among HIV-positive patients at 
      a nonprofit, non-governmental faith-based clinic providing free and holistic care 
      in Jos City, Plateau State, Nigeria. DESIGN: This was a retrospective analysis of 
      HIV-1 screening and ART received by patients at Faith Alive Foundation Hospital 
      (FAFH). From January through December 2005, voluntary counseling and testing 
      (VCT) was freely available to all patients who requested it. Also beginning in 
      December 2004, HIV-1 infected patients were enrolled in an expanded HIV/AIDS 
      program at FAFH, where patients in clinical stages 3 or 4 based on World Health 
      Organization (WHO) clinical classification, or had a CD4(+) cell count of less 
      than 200/ml, were initiated on a simplified highly active ART (HAART) regimen 
      through PEPFAR funding. Data from the first six quarters of the FAFH-PEPFAR ART 
      program are presented here. Additionally, analysis of 645 patients who have 
      received ART for one year, including changes in CD4(+) cell count from baseline 
      is shown. RESULTS: In 2005, a total of 7672 persons received VCT and 3869 (50.4%) 
      HIV-1 positive results were found. From October 2004 to March 2006, the total 
      number of patients enrolled in the FAFH HIV/AIDS program rose from 1330 to 5946 
      people. Over the same period, the number of patients who received ART increased 
      from 302 to 1667. A majority of patients received an oral ART regimen consisting 
      of generic nevirapine, lamivudine, and stavudine. The number of patients 
      initiated on ART each quarter ranged from 57-578, and the number of deaths of 
      patients on ART was between 12 and 21 people per quarter. Analysis of 645 
      patients initiated on ART during the first quarter of the FAFH-PEPFAR ART program 
      revealed that the median CD4(+) cell count at baseline was 106/ml and the median 
      increase was 173/ml (median time of follow-up, 7.0 months). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Comprehensive HIV/AIDS care has been significantly expanded at FAFH, a free and 
      holistic medical center in Jos, Nigeria. Cumulative data from the first year of 
      this PEPFAR-funded ART program indicated that promising outcomes are achievable 
      through delivery of care at this faith-based medical center.

TI  - Lack of mutations in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 and 3 genes in a Taiwanese 
      (ethnic Chinese) cohort of familial and early-onset parkinsonism.
PG  - 434-8
AB  - Recent reports suggest that CAG triplet expansions of spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      2 and 3 (SCA2 and SCA3) genes are the cause of typical levodopa-responsive 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) in familial cases, several of which were ethnic Chinese. 
      To investigate the role of SCA2 and SCA3 mutations in Chinese familial and 
      early-onset PD patients, we analyzed CAG triplet repeat expansions of SCA2 and 
      SCA3 genes in a cohort of 73 Taiwanese/Ethnic Chinese familial and early-onset PD 
      patients [mean age at onset 42.70 +/- 7.17 years (mean +/- SD)]. Thirteen of them 
      (17.8%) had positive family history. All patients received comprehensive clinical 
      evaluation including a thorough neurological examination, laboratory tests, and 
      neuroimaging studies to exclude secondary causes and atypical parkinsonism. The 
      CAG repeat length in these genes was determined using polymerase chain reaction 
      polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. SCA2 gene CAG repeats ranged from 15 to 26 
      repeats with a median of 20, and SCA3 gene CAG repeats ranged from 15 to 40 with 
      a median of 15. No long pathogenic repeats were found in either SCA2 or SCA3, 
      although borderline CAG repeat number was detected in the SCA3 gene of four 
      patients. Thus, mutations of SCA2 or SCA3 did not play a major role in familial 
      or early-onset PD in our study cohort. PD patients without autosomal dominant 
      family history or obvious cerebellar ataxia should not be candidates for routine 
      screening of SCA2 or SCA3 mutations for cost-effectiveness.

TI  - Multiplex families with multiple system atrophy.
PG  - 545-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) has been considered a sporadic disease, 
      without patterns of inheritance. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of 
      4 multiplex families with MSA, including clinical genetic aspects. DESIGN: 
      Clinical and genetic study. SETTING: Four departments of neurology in Japan. 
      Patients Eight patients in 4 families with parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and 
      autonomic failure with age at onset ranging from 58 to 72 years. Two siblings in 
      each family were affected with these conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical 
      evaluation was performed according to criteria by Gilman et al. Trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the responsible genes for the spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 
      series and for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) was evaluated by 
      polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequence analysis of coding regions in the 
      alpha-synuclein gene was performed. RESULTS: Consanguineous marriage was observed 
      in 1 of 4 families. Among 8 patients, 1 had definite MSA, 5 had probable MSA, and 
      2 had possible MSA. The most frequent phenotype was MSA with predominant 
      parkinsonism, observed in 5 patients. Six patients showed pontine atrophy with 
      cross sign or slitlike signal change at the posterolateral putaminal margin or 
      both on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Possibilities of hereditary ataxias, 
      including SCA1 (ataxin 1, ATXN1), SCA2 (ATXN2), Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3 
      (ATXN1), SCA6 (ATXN1), SCA7 (ATXN7), SCA12 (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory 
      subunit B, beta isoform; PP2R2B), SCA17 (TATA box binding protein, TBP) and DRPLA 
      (atrophin 1; ATN1), were excluded, and no mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene 
      were found. CONCLUSIONS: Findings in these multiplex families suggest the 
      presence of familial MSA with autosomal recessive inheritance and a genetic 
      predisposition to MSA. Molecular genetic approaches focusing on familial MSA are 
      expected to provide clues to the pathogenesis of MSA.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat dynamic mutation identifying susceptibility in familial and 
      sporadic chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.
PG  - 73-9
AB  - Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) has a strong hereditary component, but an 
      understanding of predisposition genes is poor. Anticipation with familial CLL has 
      been reported, although the molecular mechanism is unknown. Expansion of 
      trinucleotide repeat sequences underlies anticipation observed in 
      neurodegenerative disease. A polymerase chain reaction-based assay was used to 
      analyse the stability of ten CCG- and CAG-trinucleotide repeat tracts in 18 CLL 
      families and 140 patients with the sporadic form of the disease. The study 
      suggests that anticipation, if it occurs in CLL, is not linked to CCG- and 
      CAG-repeat expansion, however, variation in repeat length at certain loci 
      (FRA16A) may permit identification of susceptible family members. In addition, 
      polymorphisms with prognostic significance were identified. These were high 
      length (but not expanded) repeats at FRA11B (P = 0.01), ATXN1 (P = 0.032) and 
      ATXN3 (P = 0.022), all associated with poor risk disease.

TI  - Cambodian founder effect for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (Machado-Joseph 
      disease).
PG  - 110-3
AB  - Four families from the same region of Cambodia immigrated to the Pacific 
      Northwest of the United States. All four families have been discovered to have 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA 3; Machado-Joseph disease) with a similar 
      clinical phenotype. CAG repeat expansions in the ATXN3 gene range from 72 to 77. 
      Mean age of onset has varied from 19 to 44 years and mean age at death of 4 
      individuals has been 60 years. The prevalence of the various subtypes of SCA 
      varies worldwide from country to country. Neurologists should be alert to the 
      possibility of SCA 3 in Cambodian patients with unexplained cerebellar ataxia.

TI  - Effects of SCA1, MJD, and DPRLA triplet repeat polymorphisms on cognitive 
      phenotypes in a normal population of adolescent twins.
PG  - 95-100
AB  - The expansion of unstable trinucleotide CAG repeat polymorphisms of a number of 
      genes causes several neurodegenerative disorders with decreased cognitive 
      function, the severity of the disorder being related to allele length at the 
      triplet repeat locus. While the effects of repeat length have been well studied 
      in clinical samples, there has been little investigation of the effects of 
      triplet repeat variation in the normal range for these genes. We have, therefore, 
      examined linkage and association for three CAG triplet repeat markers 
      (Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1, SCA1; Machado-Joseph Disease, MJD; 
      Dentatorubro-pallidoluysian Atrophy, DRPLA) to assess their contribution to 
      variation in cognitive ability (IQ, reading ability, processing speed) in a 
      normal, unselected sample of adolescent twins (248 dizygotic (DZ) sibling pairs, 
      aged 16 years). Association tests, performed in Mx and QTDT, showed a consistent 
      positive association of SCA1 with Arithmetic (P = 0.04). While association was 
      supported between SCA1 and Cambridge reading scores and between DRPLA and 
      inspection time, results were inconsistent across software packages. Given the 
      number of statistical tests performed, it is unlikely that trinucleotide repeat 
      variation in the normal range for these genes influences variation in normal 
      cognition.

TI  - Expansion of amino acid homo-sequences in proteins: insights into the role of 
      amino acid homo-polymers and of the protein context in aggregation.
PG  - 1677-85
AB  - Expansion of amino acid homo-sequences, such as polyglutamines or polyalanines, 
      in proteins has been directly implicated in various degenerative diseases through 
      a mechanism of protein misfolding and aggregation. However, it is still unclear 
      how the nature of the expansion and the protein context influence the tendency of 
      a protein to aggregate. Here, we have addressed these questions using 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 (ATX3) protein, the best characterised of the 
      polyglutamine proteins, chosen as a model system. Using a transfected mammalian 
      cell line, we demonstrate that ATX3 aggregation is noticeably reduced by deletion 
      or replacement of regions other than the polyglutamine tract. The nature of the 
      amino acid homo-sequences also has a strong influence on aggregation. From our 
      studies, we draw general conclusions on the effect of the protein architecture 
      and of the amino acid homo-sequence on pathology.

TI  - A multistep mutation mechanism drives the evolution of the CAG repeat at MJD/SCA3 
      locus.
PG  - 932-40
AB  - Despite the intense debate around the repeat instability reported on the large 
      group of neurological disorders caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions, little 
      is known about the mutation process underlying alleles in the normal range that, 
      ultimately, expand to pathological size. In this study, we assessed the mutation 
      mechanisms by which wild-type Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) alleles have been 
      generated throughout human evolution. Haplotypes including the CAG repeat, six 
      intragenic SNPs and four flanking microsatellites were analysed in 431 normal 
      chromosomes of European, Asian and African origin. A bimodal CAG repeat length 
      frequency distribution was found in the four most frequent wild-type lineages 
      (H1-GCGGCA; H2-GTGGCA; H3-TTAGAC and H4-TTACAC). Based on flanking microsatellite 
      haplotypes, the variance calculated by analysis of molecular variance between 
      modal (CAG)n alleles was little or null in lineages H1, H2 and H4, as were the 
      pairwise differences. Moreover, genetic distances among all the alleles from each 
      lineage did not reflect the allele sizes differences, as expected if a stepwise 
      mutation model was the main process of evolution. On the contrary, when exposed 
      in maximum parsimonious phylogenetic trees, a large number of mutation steps 
      separated same-size alleles, whereas several microsatellite haplotypes were 
      shared by modal CAGs. In conclusion, our results suggest that the main mutation 
      mechanism occurring in the evolution of the polymorphic CAG region at MJD/SCA3 
      locus is a multistep one, either by gene conversion or DNA slippage; repeats with 
      14, 21, 23 and 27 CAGs are the main alleles involved in this process.

TI  - Genetic analysis of SCA2, 3 and 17 in idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 11-4
AB  - Recent reports of SCA2 and SCA3 patients who presented with levodopa responsive 
      parkinsonism have generated considerable interest as they have implications for 
      genetic testing. It is unclear whether ethnic race alone or founder effects 
      within certain geographical region explain such an association. In this study, we 
      conducted genetic analysis of SCA2, 3, 17 in an ethnic Chinese cohort with early 
      onset and familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy controls. A total of 191 
      subjects comprising of 91 PD and 100 healthy controls were examined. We 
      identified one positive case of SCA2 in an early-onset sporadic PD patient who 
      had CAG 36 repeats, yielding a prevalence of 2.2% in early-onset sporadic PD 
      patients and less than 1.0% in our study PD population. The size of the repeats 
      was lower than the expanded repeats (38-57) in SCA2 patients with ataxia in our 
      population. All the children of the patient were physically normal even though 
      some of them carried the repeat expansion of similar size. No cases and controls 
      were positive for SCA3 and SCA17. We do not think routine screening of SCA2, SCA3 
      and SCA17 for all idiopathic PD patients is cost-effective in our ethnic Chinese 
      population. However, SCA2 should be a differential diagnosis in young onset 
      sporadic PD when genetic mutations of other known PD genes have been excluded.

TI  - CAG repeats in Restless Legs syndrome.
PG  - 173-6
AB  - Recent reports established an association of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1, 2, and 3. To evaluate the contribution of 
      SCA alleles to idiopathic RLS we investigated the CAG repeat length at the SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17 loci in 215 patients who fulfilled the clinical 
      criteria of RLS and presented periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS) in 
      polysomnographic recording. Fifty percent of patients had a positive family 
      history of RLS. We found one intermediate (CAG)(43) allele for SCA17 in a 
      44-year-old female with RLS starting at the age of 43. Neurologic examination and 
      family history were unremarkable in this patient. Otherwise, allele distribution 
      did not differ between RLS patients and healthy controls. Stratification for age, 
      age of onset, sex, peripheral neuropathy, and sporadic or familial RLS revealed 
      no effect. Thus, CAG repeat length in the investigated genes is not a major 
      determinant of idiopathic or familial RLS.

      in Portugal.
PG  - 156-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To gain insights on the molecular mechanisms of mutation that led to 
      the emergence of expanded alleles in the MJD gene, by studying the behavior of 
      wild-type alleles and testing the association of its distribution with the 
      representation of the disease. METHODS: The number of CAG motifs in the MJD gene 
      was determined in a representative sample of 1000 unrelated individuals. 
      Associations between the repeat size and the epidemiological representation of 
      MJD were tested. RESULTS: The allelic profile of the total sample was in the 
      normal range (13-41 repeats), with mode (CAG)23. No intermediate alleles were 
      present. Allelic size distribution showed a negative skew. The correlation 
      between the epidemiological representation of MJD in each district and the 
      frequency of small, medium and large normal alleles was not significant. Further 
      correlations performed grouping the districts also failed to produce significant 
      results. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of association between the size of the repeats 
      and the representation of MJD demonstrates that prevalence is not an indirect 
      reflection of the frequency of large normal alleles. Globally the results 
      obtained are in accordance with a model that postulates the occurrence of a few 
      mutations on the basis of most of the MJD cases worldwide.

TI  - Absence of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease within ataxic 
      patients in the Czech population.
PG  - 851-7
AB  - Although spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3)/Machado-Joseph disease is the most 
      common type of SCA worldwide, we did not identify any cases of the disease 
      amongst SCA patients in the Czech population. It has been proposed that the 
      prevalence of large normal alleles correlates with the frequency of various types 
      of SCA. We have therefore attempted to resolve the absence of SCA3 in our 
      population by investigating, within 204 normal chromosomes, the frequency and 
      nature of CAG repeats as well as two intragenic polymorphisms. We found that 
      large normal alleles with more than 33 CAG repeats were observed at a frequency 
      of only 0.49%. Whereas most of the expanded alleles worldwide have the CA 
      haplotype, this was the least common (5.4%) variant observed in our study, 
      although it was associated with a larger mean CAG repeat length (26.9). We 
      postulate that the absence of SCA3 in the Czech population might be explained by 
      the lack of large normal alleles and consequently a relatively small reservoir 
      for aberrant CAG expansions at the SCA3 locus.

TI  - Analysis of SCA-2 and SCA-3 repeats in Parkinsonism: evidence of SCA-2 expansion 
      in a family with autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 191-4
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are progressive neurodegenerative disorders 
      linked to more than 20 genetic loci. Most often, these diseases are caused by 
      expansion of triplet repeats encoding polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts. The phenotype 
      is variable and can cause a disease that overlaps clinically with Parkinson's 
      disease (PD). l-Dopa-responsive parkinsonism with minimal cerebellar deficits has 
      been described in SCA2 and SCA3. In order to define if mutation at these loci is 
      a common cause of clinically defined parkinsonism we typed the SCA-2 and SCA-3 
      repeats for expansion in a series of 280 patients diagnosed with PD or 
      parkinsonism. We identified one pathogenic expansion in SCA-2 in a North American 
      family with autosomal dominant parkinsonism.

TI  - Age at onset variance analysis in spinocerebellar ataxias: a study in a 
      Dutch-French cohort.
PG  - 505-12
AB  - In dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), the issue of whether non-CAG 
      dependent factors contribute to onset age remains unsettled. Data on SCA 
      genotype, onset age, normal/expanded CAG repeat length, sex of the patient and 
      transmitting parent, and family details were available from 802 patients. Based 
      on the model [log(10) (age at onset) = k - b CAG(exp) + epsilon], we examined 
      changes in adjusted R(2) and residual standard error following incorporation of 
      the other factors in this model. The expanded repeat explained 44.3 to 74.9% of 
      onset age variance, although this was less than 50% in SCA3 and SCA6, implicating 
      a large effect of non-CAG factors. The relation between onset age and CAG repeat 
      was similar for SCA1, 3, 6, and 7, but different for SCA2, pointing to different 
      polyglutamine effects in SCA2. For SCA2 and SCA3, 17.1 and 45.5% of onset age 
      variance, respectively, were explained by currently (unidentified) familial 
      factors. We found a significant contribution of the nonexpanded allele in SCA1 
      and SCA6. Besides polyglutamine motif (determined by the expanded CAG repeat 
      length), we identified the following age at onset modifiers: protein context in 
      SCA2; familial factors in SCA2 and SCA3; and the nonexpanded CAG repeat in SCA1 
      and SCA6.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat analysis of spinocerebellar ataxia patients in Oman.
PG  - 61-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the profile of cytosine/adenine/guanine (CAG) repeat 
      expansion in Omani spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) patients. METHODS: Ten SCA 
      patients attending the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital Neurologic clinics, 
      Al-Khoud, Oman in the 3 years starting from January 2000 were recruited for this 
      study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples and CAG repeat 
      expansion analysis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing, 
      when required. RESULTS: The CAG triplet repeats leading to polyglutamine 
      expansion and neurodegeneration are seen in spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 
      and 17. By using primers for SCA 1, 2, 3 and 7, we found the repeats were in the 
      normal range and triplet repeats do not seem to be a common cause for ataxia in 
      Oman. CONCLUSION: Spinocerebellar ataxia in Oman has the normal range of CAG 
      repeats for the commonly found SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA7.

TI  - Comparative genetics of functional trinucleotide tandem repeats in humans and 
      apes.
PG  - 329-39
AB  - Several human neurodegenerative disorders are caused by the expansion of 
      polymorphic trinucleotide repeat regions. Many of these loci are functional short 
      tandem repeats (STRs) located in brain-expressed genes, and their study is thus 
      relevant from both a medical and an evolutionary point of view. The aims of our 
      study are to infer the comparative pattern of variation and evolution of this set 
      of loci in order to show species-specific features in this group of STRs and on 
      their potential for expansion (therefore, an insight into evolutionary medicine) 
      and to unravel whether any human-specific feature may be identified in 
      brain-expressed genes involved in human disease. We analyzed the variability of 
      the normal range of seven expanding STR CAG/CTG loci (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3-MJD, SCA6, 
      SCA8, SCA12, and DRPLA) and two nonexpanding polymorphic CAG loci (KCNN3 and 
      NCOA3) in humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. The study showed a 
      general conservation of the repetitive tract and of the polymorphism in the four 
      species and high heterogeneity among loci distributions. Humans present slightly 
      larger alleles than the rest of species but a more relevant difference appears in 
      variability levels: Humans are the species with the largest variance, although 
      only for the expanding loci, suggesting a relationship between variability levels 
      and expansion potential. The sequence analysis shows high levels of sequence 
      conservation among species, a lack of correspondence between interruption 
      patterns and variability levels, and signs of conservative selective pressure for 
      some of the STR loci. Only two loci (SCA1 and SCA8) show a human specific 
      distribution, with larger alleles than the rest of species. This could account, 
      at the same time, for a human-specific trait and a predisposition to disease 
      through expansion.

TI  - Cognitive impairments in Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 1757-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive function of Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) patients has not 
      been clarified. OBJECTIVES: To determine the characteristics of cognitive 
      dysfunction in MJD patients and to assess the relationship of dysfunction to age 
      at onset, age at examination, disease duration, education, ataxia, depression, 
      anxiety, and CAG repeat length. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: 
      Research-oriented hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen genetically confirmed MJD 
      patients able to complete neuropsychological tests and 20 control subjects 
      matched to patients by age and education. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Neuropsychological tests, including general cognition, verbal and visual memory, 
      working memory, visuospatial and constructional ability, language, executive 
      function, depression, and anxiety. RESULTS: Machado-Joseph disease patients 
      scored significantly lower than controls in verbal and visual memory, in 
      visuospatial and constructional tasks, and in phonemic and semantic fluency 
      tasks. None of these impairments correlated with CAG repeat length, age at onset, 
      age at examination, disease duration, or education. Verbal fluency (words named 
      in a category) correlated with the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale 
      score. CONCLUSION: Machado-Joseph disease patients have verbal and visual memory 
      deficits, visuospatial and constructional dysfunction, and verbal fluency 
      deficits, all unrelated to CAG repeat length.

PG  - 1274-82
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      degeneration characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations. An 
      unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in MJD gene on long arm of chromosome 
      14 has been identified as the pathologic mutation of MJD and apoptosis was 
      previously shown to be responsible for the neuronal cell death of the disease. In 
      this study, we utilized human neuronal SK-N-SH cells stably transfected with 
      HA-tagged full-length MJD with 78 polyglutamine repeats to examine the effects of 
      polyglutamine expansion on neuronal cell survival in the early stage of disease. 
      Various pro-apoptotic agents were used to assess the tolerance of the mutant 
      cells and to compare the differences between cells with and without mutant 
      ataxin-3. Concentration- and time-dependent experiments showed that the increase 
      in staurosporine-induced cell death was more pronounced and accelerated in cells 
      containing expanded ataxin-3 via MTS assays. Interestingly, under basal 
      conditions, Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses showed a significant 
      decrease of Bcl-2 protein expression and an increase of cytochrome c in cells 
      containing expanded ataxin-3 when compared with those of the parental cells. The 
      same reduction of Bcl-2 was further confirmed in fibroblast cells with mutant 
      ataxin-3. In addition, exogenous expression of Bcl-2 desensitized SK-N-SH-MJD78 
      cells to poly-Q toxicity. These results indicated that mitochondrial-mediated 
      cell death plays a role in the pathogenesis of MJD. In our cellular model, 
      full-length expanded ataxin-3 that leads to neurodegenerative disorders 
      significantly impaired the expression of Bcl-2 protein, which may be, at least in 
      part, responsible for the weak tolerance to polyglutamine toxicity at the early 
      stage of disease and ultimately resulted in an increase of stress-induced cell 
      death upon apoptotic stress.

TI  - Structural and functional analysis of ataxin-2 and ataxin-3.
PG  - 3155-70
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia types 2 (SCA2) and 3 (SCA3) are autosomal-dominantly 
      inherited, neurodegenerative diseases caused by CAG repeat expansions in the 
      coding regions of the genes encoding ataxin-2 and ataxin-3, respectively. To 
      provide a rationale for further functional experiments, we explored the protein 
      architectures of ataxin-2 and ataxin-3. Using structure-based multiple sequence 
      alignments of homologous proteins, we investigated domains, sequence motifs, and 
      interaction partners. Our analyses focused on presumably functional amino acids 
      and the construction of tertiary structure models of the RNA-binding Lsm domain 
      of ataxin-2 and the deubiquitinating Josephin domain of ataxin-3. We also 
      speculate about distant evolutionary relationships of ubiquitin-binding UIM, GAT, 
      UBA and CUE domains and helical ANTH and UBX domain extensions.

TI  - Molecular architecture of CAG repeats in human disease related transcripts.
PG  - 665-79
AB  - CAG repeats are present in numerous human transcripts but neither their 
      structures nor physiological functions have been satisfactorily recognized. The 
      expanded CAG repeats are present in transcripts from several mutant genes 
      associated with hereditary neurodegenerative diseases but their contribution to 
      pathogenesis has not been documented convincingly. Here, we show that the 
      structures formed by the repeats and their natural flanking sequences in the 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 3 and type 6, and dentatorubral-palidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA) transcripts have different molecular architectures which may have 
      functional meaning. We provide evidence that the hairpin structure formed by CAG 
      repeats in mRNA fragments is preserved in full-length mRNA. We also demonstrate 
      that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that is located immediately 
      adjacent (3') to the repeats of the SCA3 transcript modulates the structures 
      formed by these sequences, and may have functional significance, as only one of 
      its variants is selected in human evolution.

TI  - Detection and isolation of trinucleotide repeat expansions using the RED method.
PG  - 47-59
AB  - To facilitate identification of disease genes containing an expanded 
      trinucleotide repeat, a repeat expansion detection (RED) and gene cloning system 
      was established. The RED method was developed to enable detection of expanded 
      trinucleotide repeat sequences in any DNA sample from any species without prior 
      knowledge of the DNA sequences flanking the repeat. The DNA to be tested is used 
      as a template for a repeat oligonucleotide to anneal and ligate in a two-step 
      cycling procedure. After hundreds of annealing/ligation cycles, a large amount of 
      oligonucleotide multimers is accumulated. The longest multimer represents the 
      largest repeat expansion in the genome tested. The gene isolation strategy is 
      based on size separation of genomic fragments, followed by subcloning and library 
      hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe. The expanded trinucleotide repeat is 
      identified throughout the procedure using the RED method. Using this approach, 
      two disease genes, the Huntington's disease gene and the MJD/SCA3 gene, were 
      cloned. This cloning strategy should be applicable to isolation of any DNA 
      fragment containing large trinucleotide repeat expansions in any species.

TI  - No association of the SCA1 (CAG)31 allele with Huntington's disease, myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1 and spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.
PG  - 61-3
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansions are the underlying mutation in several 
      neurodegenerative and neuromuscular disorders including at least eight 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA). The molecular mechanisms of repeat expansion are 
      as yet insufficiently understood. Recently, an association of the SCA1 (CAG)31 
      repeat allele with Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy type 1 was 
      described. These findings implicate a possible role of the SCA1 (CAG)31 allele in 
      other triplet diseases. We analyzed the SCA1 CAG repeat length in a large sample 
      of Huntington's disease (n=182), myotonic dystrophy type 1 (n=64) and SCA3 (n=31) 
      patients. In none of these groups was a significant association with the 31 
      repeat allele found. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that this allele 
      is involved in the etiology of trinucleotide expansion.

TI  - Molecular genetics of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia: mutation analysis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia genes and CAG/CTG repeat expansion detection in 225 
      Italian families.
PG  - 727-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, at present 
      associated with 22 loci (spinocerebellar ataxia [SCA] 1-SCA8, SCA10-SCA19, SCA21, 
      SCA22, fibroblast growth factor 14 [FGF14]-SCA, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy [DRPLA]). The relevant gene has been identified in 12 cases (SCA1-3, 
      SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, FGF14, and DRPLA), and in all but the recently identified 
      SCA14, SCA17, PRKCG and FGF14 genes, the defect consists of the expansion of a 
      short nucleotide repeat. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relative prevalence of 
      SCA1-3, SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, and SCA17 gene expansions in Italian families with 
      hereditary ataxia, specifically to verify the occurrence of SCA10, SCA12, and 
      SCA17 in Italy; and to analyze samples from probands with negative test results 
      at the initial screening by means of the repeat expansion detection technique to 
      identify CAG/CTG expansions in novel loci.Patients Two hundred twenty-five 
      unrelated Italian index cases with hereditary ataxia, most (n = 183) of whom 
      presented with a clear dominantly transmitted trait. RESULTS: We found that SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene mutations accounted for most cases (21% and 24%, respectively). We 
      found SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, and SCA17 to be very rare (approximately 1% each), 
      and no case of SCA10 or SCA12 was identified. Half of the index cases (113/225) 
      were negative for expansions in the known SCA genes. Repeat expansion detection 
      analysis performed on 111 of these cases showed a CAG/CTG repeat expansion of at 
      least 50 triplets in 22 (20%). Twenty-one of 22 expansions could be attributed to 
      length variation at 2 polymorphic loci (expanded repeat domain CAG/CTG 1 [ERDA1] 
      or CTG repeat on chromosome 18q21.1 [CTG18.1]). In 1 patient, the expansion was 
      assigned to the DRPLA gene. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of SCA1-3 and SCA6-7 
      gene mutations is peculiar in Italy. We found a relatively high frequency of SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene expansions; SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 mutations were rare, compared with 
      other European countries. No SCA10 or SCA12 and only a few SCA8 (2/225) and SCA17 
      (2/225) families were detected. In patients negative for defects in known SCA 
      genes, repeat expansion detection data strongly suggest that, at least in our 
      population, CAG/CTG expansions in novel genes should be considered an unlikely 
      cause of the SCA phenotype.

TI  - Analysis of trinucleotide repeats in different SCA loci in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      patients and in normal population of Taiwan.
PG  - 355-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) patients referred to our research 
      center, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD (Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, SCA8 and SCA12 
      loci were assessed for expansion of trinucleotide repeats. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      A total of 211 ADCA patients, including 202 patients with dominantly inherited 
      ataxia from 81 Taiwanese families and nine patients with sporadic ataxia, were 
      included in this study and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. 
      The amplified products of all loci were analyzed on both 3% agarose gels and 6% 
      denaturing urea-polyacrylamide gels. PCR-based Southern blots were also applied 
      for the detection of SCA7 locus. RESULTS: The SCA1 mutation was detected in six 
      affected individuals from one family (1.2%) with expanded alleles of 50-53 CAG 
      repeats. Fourteen individuals from nine families (11%) had a CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while affected SCA2 alleles have 34-49 CAG 
      repeats. The SCA3/MJD CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in 60 affected 
      individuals from 26 families (32%) was expanded to 71-85 CAG repeats. As for the 
      SCA7 locus, there were two affected individuals from one family (1.2%) possessed 
      41 and 100 CAG repeats, respectively. However, we did not detect expansion in the 
      SCA6, SCA8 and SCA12 loci in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The SCA3/MJD CAG expansion 
      was the most frequent mutation among the SCA patients. The relative prevalence of 
      SCA3/MJD in Taiwan was higher than that of SCA2, SCA1 and SCA7.

TI  - Haplotype study in Dutch SCA3 and SCA6 families: evidence for common founder 
      mutations.
PG  - 441-6
AB  - This pilot study was initiated to show the existence of founder effects in the 
      Dutch autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) population. The ADCAs comprise 
      a clinically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders and the estimated 
      prevalence in the Netherlands is approximately 3:100 000 individuals. Here, we 
      focused on the SCA3 and SCA6 genes because mutations in these genes occur most 
      frequently in the Netherlands. We were able to determine a common origin of the 
      CAG repeat expansions in the majority of Dutch SCA3 and SCA6 families. Haplotype 
      analysis and linkage disequilibrium studies with polymorphic markers revealed 
      shared haplotypes surrounding the SCA3 and SCA6 genes. These results strongly 
      suggest that ADCA families can be traced back to common ancestors in particular 
      parts of the Netherlands.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia: SCA2 is the most frequent mutation in 
      eastern India.
PG  - 448-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) has been reported as the 
      commonest dominant hereditary ataxia in India. However, India is an ethnically 
      and religiously diverse population. Previous studies have not clearly indicated 
      exact ethnic and religious origins, and must therefore be interpreted with 
      caution. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of different 
      SCA mutations in a relatively homogeneous population from eastern India. METHODS: 
      We identified 28 families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia from eastern 
      India. Each underwent full clinical evaluation and were analysed for the presence 
      of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, and SCA17 mutations. In addition, 
      haplotype analysis was carried out in seven of the 16 families with SCA2. 
      RESULTS: Seven patients from four (14%) families were positive for an expansion 
      in SCA1 and 26 patients from 16 (57%) families were positive for an expansion in 
      SCA2. No mutations were detected in the remaining eight families (29%). Most of 
      the SCA1 and SCA2 families were Hindu from the state of Bihar. Five out of 26 
      SCA2 patients in this study did not have slow saccades. In addition, four of 
      seven SCA1 patients had slow saccades. We found an association between the SCA2 
      CAG repeat expansion and the 285 base pair (bp) allele of microsatellite marker 
      D12S1672, and also data supportive of the association between the expansion and 
      the 225 bp allele of D12S1333, which has been previously described. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We conclude that (1) although slow ocular saccades are highly suggestive of SCA2, 
      that they are not universal, nor are they exclusive to this disorder and (2) SCA2 
      is likely to be the commonest dominant ataxia in eastern India, with further 
      evidence for a founder effect.

TI  - Genetic testing in spinocerebellar ataxia in Taiwan: expansions of trinucleotide 
      repeats in SCA8 and SCA17 are associated with typical Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 209-14
AB  - DNA tests in normal subjects and patients with ataxia and Parkinson's disease 
      (PD) were carried out to assess the frequency of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) and 
      to document the distribution of SCA mutations underlying ethnic Chinese in 
      Taiwan. MJD/SCA3 (46%) was the most common autosomal dominant SCA in the 
      Taiwanese cohort, followed by SCA6 (18%) and SCA1 (3%). No expansions of SCA 
      types 2, 10, 12, or dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) were detected. The 
      clinical phenotypes of these affected SCA patients were very heterogeneous. All 
      of them showed clinical symptoms of cerebellar ataxia, with or without other 
      associated features. The frequencies of large normal alleles are closely 
      associated with the prevalence of SCA1, SCA2, MJD/SCA3, SCA6, and DRPLA among 
      Taiwanese, Japanese, and Caucasians. Interestingly, abnormal expansions of SCA8 
      and SCA17 genes were detected in patients with PD. The clinical presentation for 
      these patients is typical of idiopathic PD with the following characteristics: 
      late onset of disease, resting tremor in the limbs, rigidity, bradykinesia, and a 
      good response to levodopa. This study appears to be the first report describing 
      the PD phenotype in association with an expanded allele in the TATA-binding 
      protein gene and suggests that SCA8 may also be a cause of typical PD.

TI  - Defining a metabolic phenotype in the brain of a transgenic mouse model of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 3.
PG  - 334-40
AB  - Many of the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are caused by expansions of CAG 
      trinucleotide repeats encoding abnormal stretches of polyglutamine. SCA3 or 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is the commonest dominant inherited ataxia disease, 
      with pathological phenotypes apparent with a CAG triplet repeat length of 61-84. 
      In this study a mouse model of SCA3 has been examined which was produced using a 
      human yeast artificial chromosome containing the MJD gene with a CAG triplet 
      expansion of 84 repeats. These mice have previously been shown to possess a mild 
      progressive cerebellar deficit. NMR-based metabolomics/metabonomics in 
      conjunction with multivariate pattern recognition identified a number of 
      metabolic perturbations in SCA3 mice. These changes included a consistent 
      increase in glutamine concentration in tissue extracts of the cerebellum and 
      cerebrum and spectra obtained from intact tissue using magic angle spinning 
      (1)H-NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, these profiles demonstrated metabolic 
      abnormalities were present in the cerebrum, a region not previously implicated in 
      SCA3. As well as an increase in glutamine both brain regions demonstrated 
      decreases in GABA, choline, phosphocholine and lactate (representing the 
      summation of lactate in vivo, and postmortem glycolysis of glucose and glycogen). 
      The metabolic changes are discussed in terms of the formation of neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusions associated with SCA3. This study suggests high-resolution 
      (1)H-NMR spectroscopy coupled with pattern recognition may provide a rapid method 
      for assessing the phenotype of animal models of human disease.

TI  - Variation of CAG repeats and two intragenic polymorphisms at SCA3 locus among 
      Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3 patients and diverse normal populations from eastern 
      India.
PG  - 407-14
AB  - OBJECTIVES: MJD1/SCA3 is the most common type of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 
      worldwide. To explain the low prevalence of the disease among SCA patients from 
      eastern India, we analysed CAG repeats and two bi-allelic intragenic markers at 
      SCA3 locus among 412 normal individuals and 10 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      For CAG repeat analysis, PCR amplified fragments were run on polyacrylamide gel, 
      transferred to a membrane, probed with (CAG)10 and detected on an autoradiograph. 
      Bi-allelic markers were analysed using allele specific PCR amplification. 
      RESULTS: Large normal alleles (>33 CAG repeats) were 0.015 in pooled populations. 
      All the patients had the common haplotype C-A as observed worldwide. Frequency of 
      C-A haplotype among large normal alleles was 0.75. CONCLUSIONS: Observed low 
      prevalence of SCA3 could be because of the low prevalence of large normal alleles 
      that might act as the reservoir for the expanded alleles. SCA3 mutation in Indian 
      populations had the same origin as found worldwide.

TI  - Prenatal diagnosis of Machado-Joseph disease/Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 in 
      Taiwan: early detection of expanded ataxin-3.
PG  - 195-200
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3) is a rare 
      autosomal dominative disorder in which one of the neurodegenerative disorders is 
      caused by a translated CAG repeat expansion. Here, we present the first prenatal 
      diagnosis of MJD in Taiwan in a woman whose husband was known to carry an 
      unstable CAG repeat expansion in the MJD gene. After evaluating the couples' 
      motivation and psychological tolerance, amniocentesis was performed at gestation 
      of 13 weeks. The diagnosis was made using a simple nonradioactive polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) for rapid detection of the presence of an expanded MJD 
      allele. Meanwhile, using radioactive PCR, we identified the presence of an 
      unusual shortness of CAG expansion in the MJD gene with 74 repeats in the fetus 
      compared with 78 repeats in the father. After termination of the pregnancy, 
      Western blot analysis further confirmed the presence of normal and mutant 
      ataxin-3 in the fetal tissue. In summary, we have performed the first prenatal 
      diagnosis of MJD in Taiwan, and described our experience with an at-risk male 
      requesting counseling, carrier testing, and prenatal diagnosis for Machado-Joseph 
      disease. Early detection of both normal and expanded ataxin-3 in fetal tissues 
      was first demonstrated in the present study.

TI  - Mutation at the SCA17 locus is not a common cause of parkinsonism.
PG  - 317-20
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 17 is a dominant, progressive, neurodegenerative 
      disorder. The disease is caused by a triplet repeat expansion mutation within 
      TATA-binding protein (TBP). Ataxia, dementia, parkinsonism and dystonia are 
      common features. We have previously shown in several pedigrees that SCA-2 and 
      SCA-3 can cause both parkinsonism and typical Parkinson's disease in the absence 
      of prominent ataxia; a finding which has been confirmed by others. Given these 
      previous findings and the description of parkinsonism as a common feature of 
      SCA-17 we examined this locus in a series of probands from families with 2 or 
      more members affected with parkinsonism (n=51) and a group of sporadic 
      parkinsonism patients (n=59). We did not find any repeat sizes in the pathogenic 
      range. The repeats we observed ranged from 29 to 41 (mean 36.8; median 37). We 
      conclude that SCA-17 repeat expansion mutations are not a common cause of 
      familial parkinsonism.

TI  - Down-regulation of heat shock protein 27 in neuronal cells and non-neuronal cells 
      expressing mutant ataxin-3.
PG  - 307-14
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is an autosomal 
      dominant spinocerebellar degeneration characterized by a wide range of clinical 
      manifestations. Unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the MJD gene has 
      been identified as the pathologic mutation of MJD. In this study, human SK-N-SH 
      neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with full-length MJD with 78 CAG repeats 
      were established. Compared with the parental cells, cells expressing mutant 
      ataxin-3 displayed normal morphology for over 80 generations. Less than 1% of the 
      transfected cells contained nuclear aggregates under basal conditions, indicating 
      that this cellular model represented an early disease stage. While t-butyl 
      hydroperoxide (TBH) was used to assess the oxidative tolerance of cells, the 
      results demonstrated that the transfected cells were more susceptible to low 
      concentrations of TBH than the parental cells. Most interestingly, from 2D gel 
      electrophoresis analysis, we identified that the expression of heat shock protein 
      27 (HSP27), known as a suppressor of poly(Q)-mediated cell death, dramatically 
      decreased in SK-N-SH cells stably transfected with full-length mutant MJD. The 
      same reduction of HSP27 was further confirmed in lymphoblastoid cells from MJD 
      patients. Our results demonstrated that both neuronal and non-neuronal cells with 
      expanded full-length ataxin-3 revealed reduced protein expression of HSP27. We 
      propose that the reduction of HSP27 in the early stage of the disease plays an 
      important role during cell death process in MJD.

TI  - Frequency analysis and clinical characterization of spinocerebellar ataxia types 
      1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 in Korean patients.
PG  - 858-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: By genetic analysis, the CAG repeat expansion has been established in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. Despite the genetic 
      differentiation of SCA, the characterization of the phenotypes of various SCAs 
      has been challenging for better clinical diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the 
      frequencies and the clinical manifestations of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 
      in Korean patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed genetic analysis in 253 
      unrelated Korean patients with progressive cerebellar ataxia. We compared the 
      frequencies, inheritance patterns, and various clinical manifestations of 
      patients with genetically confirmed SCA. RESULTS: Among the 52 patients with 
      expanded CAG repeat, the most frequent SCA type was SCA2, followed by SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA1, and SCA7. Nine patients (17%) had a negative family history of ataxia, 
      mostly in SCA6. There were characteristic clinical features such as hypotonia and 
      optic atrophy for SCA1; hyporeflexia for SCA2; nystagmus, bulging eye, and 
      dystonia for SCA3; and macular degeneration for SCA7. Interestingly, 4 patients 
      (1 with SCA2, 1 with SCA3, and 2 with SCA6) were misdiagnosed as having 
      multiple-system atrophy because of the absence of family history and the presence 
      of parkinsonism and urinary incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a 
      detailed analysis of the clinical characteristics of the genetically defined 
      CAG-repeat SCAs in Korean patients. Although phenotypes were heterogeneous, some 
      clinical features may be helpful for clinical diagnosis. However, genetic studies 
      for SCA are needed despite uncertain family history or the presence of atypical 
      clinical features causing misdiagnosis as atypical parkinsonism.

TI  - A novel autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA22) linked to chromosome 
      1p21-q23.
PG  - 1293-9
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically, pathologically 
      and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. Ten responsible genes have been 
      identified for spinocerebellar ataxia types SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, 
      SCA10, SCA12 and SCA17, and dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      mutation is caused by an expansion of a CAG, CTG or ATTCT repeat sequence of 
      these genes. Six additional loci, SCA4, SCA5, SCA11, SCA13, SCA14 and SCA16 have 
      also been mapped. The growing heterogeneity of the autosomal dominant forms of 
      these diseases shows that the genetic aetiologies of at least 20% of ADCA have 
      yet to be elucidated. We ascertained and clinically characterized a 
      four-generation Chinese pedigree segregating an autosomal dominant phenotype for 
      cerebellar ataxia. Direct mutation analysis, linkage analysis for all known SCA 
      loci and a genome-wide linkage study were performed. Direct mutation analysis 
      excluded SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17 and DRPLA, and genetic linkage analysis 
      excluded SCA4, 5, 11, 13, 14 and 16. The genome-wide linkage study suggested 
      linkage to a locus on chromosome 1p21-q23, with the highest two-point LOD score 
      at D1S1167 (Zmax = 3.46 at theta = 0.00). Multipoint analysis and haplotype 
      reconstruction traced this novel SCA locus (SCA22) to a 43.7-cM interval flanked 
      by D1S206 and D1S2878 (Zmax = 3.78 under four liability classes, and 2.67 using 
      affected-only method). The age at onset ranged from 10 to 46 years. All affected 
      members had gait ataxia with variable features of dysarthria and hyporeflexia. 
      Head MRI showed homogeneous atrophy of the cerebellum without involvement of the 
      brainstem. In six parent-child pairs, median onset occurred 10 years earlier in 
      offspring than in their parents, suggesting anticipation. This family is distinct 
      from other families with SCA and is characterized by a slowly progressive, pure 
      cerebellar ataxia.

TI  - Searching for modulating effects of SCA2, SCA6 and DRPLA CAG tracts on the 
      Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3) phenotype.
PG  - 211-4
AB  - CONTEXT: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD/SCA3) is an autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia of adult onset. The variability in age at onset and the complex and 
      heterogeneous neurologic findings indicate that MJD, caused by a major gene, is 
      modulated by modifier factors. OBJECTIVE: To study if the polymorphic CAG repeats 
      at other loci (namely, SCA2, SCA6 and DRPLA) thus acted as modifier factors of 
      this disease. DESIGN: Case-control. SETTING: Ambulatory care in a referral 
      center. PATIENTS: A convenience sample of 39 unrelated, Brazilian patients with 
      MJD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: age of onset, anticipation, clinical subtypes and 
      neurological findings. RESULTS: Fasciculations were associated with CAG repeat 
      length of the long SCA2 allele (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.03, after Bonferroni 
      procedure). Other measures (age of onset, anticipation, clinical types and other 
      neurological signs) were not associated with CAG repeat length of SCA2, SCA6 and 
      DRPLA genes. CONCLUSIONS: The present results show that the CAG tract of SCA2 
      gene interferes with MJD phenotype. Further studies, with patients of other 
      origins and with typing of other (CAG)n loci, are necessary.

TI  - Structural modeling of ataxin-3 reveals distant homology to adaptins.
PG  - 355-70
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a polyglutamine disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the coding region of a gene encoding ataxin-3, a protein of 
      yet unknown function. Based on a comprehensive computational analysis, we propose 
      a structural model and structure-based functions for ataxin-3. Our predictive 
      strategy comprises the compilation of multiple sequence and structure alignments 
      of carefully selected proteins related to ataxin-3. These alignments are 
      consistent with additional information on sequence motifs, secondary structure, 
      and domain architectures. The application of complementary methods revealed the 
      homology of ataxin-3 to ENTH and VHS domain proteins involved in membrane 
      trafficking and regulatory adaptor functions. We modeled the structure of 
      ataxin-3 using the adaptin AP180 as a template and assessed the reliability of 
      the model by comparison with known sequence and structural features. We could 
      further infer potential functions of ataxin-3 in agreement with known 
      experimental data. Our database searches also identified an as yet 
      uncharacterized family of proteins, which we named josephins because of their 
      pronounced homology to the Josephin domain of ataxin-3.

TI  - Dementia and delirium in 4 patients with Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 1804-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD; spinocerebellar ataxia type 3) is a 
      hereditary neurodegenerative disease caused by mutation of the MJD1 gene. 
      Patients with MJD usually present with cerebellar ataxia, external 
      ophthalmoplegia, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, and muscle wasting. However, 
      it has been reported that these patients do not demonstrate dementia. CASE 
      DESCRIPTION: We noticed symptoms of dementia and delirium in 4 patients with MJD. 
      The symptoms included abnormal behavior, excitation, an uncooperative attitude, 
      crying, disorientation, slow thought processes, hallucinations, and delusions. 
      These symptoms were observed in patients with a relatively young onset age, and 
      after a long clinical course. In these patients, the CAG repeat length in the 
      MJD1 gene was much longer compared with the mean repeat length found in patients 
      with MJD. On electroencephalographical examination, they showed slow background 
      activity, but computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans showed no 
      cerebrocortical atrophy. Neuropathological findings in 2 patients revealed a 
      normal cortical structure on conventional morphological examination, but at 
      immunohistochemical examination, we found abnormal staining by an 
      antipolyglutamine antibody in the cerebrocortical neuronal nuclei. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Symptoms of dementia and delirium in patients with MJD could occur in the late 
      stages, and they might be caused not by loss of cerebrocortical neurons, but by 
      their dysfunction.

TI  - Paradoxical absence of nuclear inclusion in cerebellar Purkinje cells of 
      hereditary ataxias linked to CAG expansion.
PG  - 450-2
AB  - Degeneration of cerebellar cortex is one of the principal features of hereditary 
      ataxias linked to expansion of CAG repeat. In an attempt to clarify possible 
      correlation between neuronal depletion and neuronal intranuclear inclusions, both 
      triggered by the pathological expansion of CAG repeat, cerebellar sections from 
      SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and DRPLA cases were immunostained with anti-ubiquitin or 
      anti-expanded polyglutamine antibody (1C2) and were screened for the presence of 
      neuronal intranuclear inclusions. Although the degree of cerebellar degeneration 
      varied greatly, cerebellar Purkinje cells were uniformly characterised by the 
      absence of neuronal intranuclear inclusion. Complete absence of neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusion in Purkinje cells is apparently paradoxical and hardly 
      explained if neuronal intranuclear inclusion formation is positively correlated 
      to a mechanism accelerating neuronal death. It may, otherwise, suggest an 
      intrinsic link between neuronal intranuclear inclusion formation and 
      neurodegeneration in opposite directions in human Purkinje cells, more or less 
      affected in these CAG repeat disorders.

TI  - Increased (CTG/CAG)(n) lengths in myotonic dystrophy type 1 and Machado-Joseph 
      disease genes in idiopathic azoospermia patients.
PG  - 1578-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increase in CAG trinucleotide repeat length in the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene has been linked to idiopathic azoospermia. METHODS: In order 
      to test whether other (CAG/CTG)(n) loci are also affected, the (CAG/CTG)(n) 
      frequency distribution at myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), Machado-Joseph disease 
      (MJD), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 8 (SCA8) loci, in addition to the AR gene, was investigated in 48 
      azoospermia patients and 47 controls. RESULTS: The median CAG repeat length in 
      the AR gene was significantly longer in azoospermia patients than in controls (23 
      versus 21, P < 0.001). Significant differences were also noted in the upper tails 
      of trinucleotide repeat length distributions at both DM1 and MJD loci between the 
      two populations. At the DM1 locus, alleles of more than 18 repeats were observed 
      only in azoospermia patients, and not in controls (P = 0.014). At the MJD locus, 
      the frequency of normal alleles (ANs) with 29 or more CAG repeats was also much 
      higher in azoospermia patients (29.2 versus 7.4%; P = 0.0001). However, the 
      repeat length distribution at DRPLA and SCA8 loci did not differ in the two 
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicated that, at least in a subset of 
      azoospermia patients, there was an increase in the number of trinucleotide 
      repeats in some disease loci. Thus, it is noteworthy to evaluate whether 
      offspring of these azoospermia patients, if born by assisted reproductive 
      technologies, have an increased risk of trinucleotide repeat diseases.

TI  - A simple method for the detection of neurologic disorders associated with CAG 
      repeat expansion using PCR-microtiter plate hybridization.
PG  - 215-23
AB  - A new screening method was developed for the detection of CAG expanded alleles in 
      patients with hereditary ataxia using polymerase chain reaction-based microtiter 
      plate hybridization (PCR-MPH). The system can be applied to detect pathologic 
      alleles by hybridization with the immobilized (CAG)48 repeat probe derived from 
      the unrelated gene 'ERDA1' except for the CAG repeats. We examined 10 individuals 
      with SCA3, 10 with Huntington disease and 30 normal controls (31 controls for 
      SCA3) using this method. The results showed that a clear discrimination was 
      possible in all cases. We suggest that this system be made available for mass 
      screening of patients with hereditary ataxia disorders. This report is the first 
      to demonstrate that a PCR-MPH system can be successfully applied to DNA size 
      differentiation in addition to base pair mismatches. Also, our design of the 
      probe is unique in that the probe motif stem from the unrelated gene sequence and 
      not from the synthetic oligonucleotides.

TI  - YAC transgenic mice carrying pathological alleles of the MJD1 locus exhibit a 
      mild and slowly progressive cerebellar deficit.
PG  - 1075-94
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD; MIM 109150) is a late-onset neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine tract within the MJD1 gene. 
      We have previously reported the generation of human yeast artificial chromosome 
      (YAC) constructs encompassing the MJD1 locus into which expanded (CAG)(76) and 
      (CAG)(84) repeat motifs have been introduced by homologous recombination. 
      Transgenic mice containing pathological alleles with polyglutamine tract lengths 
      of 64, 67, 72, 76 and 84 repeats, as well as the wild type with 15 repeats, have 
      now been generated using these YAC constructs. The mice with expanded alleles 
      demonstrate a mild and slowly progressive cerebellar deficit, manifesting as 
      early as 4 weeks of age. As the disease progresses, pelvic elevation becomes 
      markedly flattened, accompanied by hypotonia, and motor and sensory loss. 
      Neuronal intranuclear inclusion (NII) formation and cell loss is prominent in the 
      pontine and dentate nuclei, with variable cell loss in other regions of the 
      cerebellum from 4 weeks of age. Interestingly, peripheral nerve demyelination and 
      axonal loss is detected in symptomatic mice from 26 weeks of age. In contrast, 
      transgenic mice carrying the wild-type (CAG)(15) allele of the MJD1 locus appear 
      completely normal at 20 months. Disease severity increases with the level of 
      expression of the expanded protein and the size of the repeat. These mice are 
      representative of MJD and will be a valuable resource for the detailed analysis 
      of the roles of repeat length, tissue specificity and level of expression in the 
      neurodegenerative processes underlying MJD pathogenesis.

      SCA-10-14, SCA-16, and SCA-17) and nine of the corresponding genes have been 
      cloned. In SCA-1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA-12 and SCA-17 the mutation has been 
      shown to be an expanded CAG repeat. Previously, the length of the CAG repeat was 
      found to account for 50 to 80% of variance in age at onset. Because of 
      heterogeneity in encoded proteins, different pathophysiologic mechanisms leading 
      to neurodegeneration could be involved. The relationship between CAG repeat 
      length and age at onset would then differ accordingly. METHOD: Based on the 
      results of SCA mutation analysis in the three DNA diagnostic laboratories that 
      serve the entire Dutch population, the authors surveyed the number of families 
      and affected individuals per SCA gene, as well as individual repeat length and 
      age at onset. Regression analysis was applied to study the relationship between 
      CAG repeat length and age at onset per SCA gene. The slopes of the different 
      regression curves were compared. RESULTS: On November 1, 2000, mutations were 
      found in 145 ADCA families and 391 affected individuals were identified. The 
      authors extrapolated a minimal prevalence of 3.0 per 100,000 (range 2.8 to 
      3.8/100,000). SCA3 was the most frequent mutation. CAG repeat length contributed 
      to 52 to 76% of age at onset variance. Regression curve slopes for SCA-1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, and SCA7 did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated minimal 
      prevalence of ADCA in the Netherlands is 3.0 per 100,000 inhabitants. Except for 
      SCA6, the relationship between age at onset and CAG repeat expansion does not 
      differ significantly between SCA-1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA7 patient groups in our 
      population, indicating that these SCA subtypes share similar mechanisms of 
      polyglutamine-induced neurotoxicity, despite heterogeneity in gene products.

TI  - Spastic paraplegia, ataxia, mental retardation (SPAR): a novel genetic disorder.
PG  - 411-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a kindred with a dominantly inherited neurologic disorder 
      manifested either as uncomplicated spastic paraplegia or ataxia, spastic 
      paraplegia, and mental retardation. METHODS: Neurologic examinations and 
      molecular genetic analysis (exclusion of known SCA and HSP genes and loci; and 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion detection [RED]) were performed in six affected 
      and four unaffected subjects in this family. MRI, electromyography (EMG), and 
      nerve conduction studies were performed in three affected subjects. RESULTS: The 
      phenotype of this dominantly inherited syndrome varied in succeeding generations. 
      Pure spastic paraplegia was present in the earliest generation; subsequent 
      generations had ataxia and mental retardation. MRI showed marked atrophy of the 
      spinal cord in all patients and cerebellar atrophy in those with ataxia. 
      Laboratory analysis showed that the disorder was not caused by mutations in genes 
      that cause SCA-1, SCA-2, SCA-3, SCA-6, SCA-7, SCA-8, and SCA-12; not linked to 
      other known loci for autosomal dominant ataxia (SCA-4, SCA-5, SCA-10, SCA-11, 
      SCA-13, SCA-14, and SCA-16); and not linked to known loci for autosomal dominant 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (SPG-3, SPG-4, SPG-6, SPG-8, SPG-9, SPG-10, 
      SPG-12, and SPG-13) or autosomal recessive HSP SPG-7. Analysis of 
      intergenerational differences in age at onset of symptoms suggests genetic 
      anticipation. Using RED, the authors did not detect expanded CAG, CCT, TGG, or 
      CGT repeats that segregate with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The authors describe an 
      unusual, dominantly inherited neurologic disorder in which the phenotype (pure 
      spastic paraplegia or spastic ataxia with variable mental retardation) differed 
      in subsequent generations. The molecular explanation for apparent genetic 
      anticipation does not appear to involve trinucleotide repeat expansion.

TI  - Is the 31 CAG repeat allele of the spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) gene locus 
      non-specifically associated with trinucleotide expansion diseases?
PG  - 201-5
AB  - A number of human hereditary neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders are 
      caused by the expansion of trinucleotide repeats within certain genes. The 
      molecular mechanisms that underlie these expansions are not yet known. We have 
      analyzed six trinucleotide repeat-containing loci [spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, 
      SCA3, SCA8), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), Huntington chorea (HD) 
      and fragile X syndrome (FRAXA)] in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients (n = 
      52). As controls, we analyzed two groups of subjects: healthy control subjects (n 
      =133), and a group of patients with non-triplet neuromuscular diseases (n = 68) 
      caused by point mutations, deletions or duplications (spinal muscular atrophy, 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 1A, hereditary neuropathy with liability to 
      pressure palsies, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy). Allele frequency 
      distributions for all tested loci were similar in these three groups with the 
      exception of the SCA1 locus. In DM1 patients, the SCA1 allele with 31 CAG repeats 
      account for 40.4% of all chromosomes tested, which is significantly higher than 
      in two other groups (11.3% in healthy controls and 6.6% in the group of 
      non-triplet diseased patients; P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). This is 
      consistent with our previous findings in HD patients. The absence of this 
      association in non-triplet diseases as well as in healthy controls could indicate 
      a possible role of this SCA1 allele with 31 repeats in triplet diseases. Here we 
      discuss a possible role of the SCA1 region in pathological trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions.

TI  - Molecular analysis of Spinocerebellar ataxias in Koreans: frequencies and 
      reference ranges of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7.
PG  - 336-41
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. CAG repeat expansions in the causative genes have been identified as 
      the basic cause of several types of SCAs, and have been used for the diagnoses 
      and classifications of patients with ataxia. In order to assess the frequency and 
      CAG repeat size ranges of SCAs, and to establish an effective strategy for 
      molecular diagnosis, we performed a molecular analysis of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      and SCA7 in 76 patients. These patients were as follows: 32 with dominant 
      inheritance, 39 sporadic cases, and 5 with unknown family histories. The normal 
      and affected CAG repeat size ranges were established at five SCA loci in Koreans, 
      which was consistent with previous reports. The total prevalence of the five 
      types of SCAs was 39.5% in the 76 patients with ataxia, regardless of their 
      family history. It was 75.0% in the 32 families with a dominant inheritance. The 
      most frequent type was SCA3 (15.8%), followed by SCA2 (14.5%). Both types 
      combined formed 76.7% of the 30 patients with CAG expansions. SCA1, SCA6, and 
      SCA7 were less frequent, affecting 3.9%, 2.6%, and 2.6% of the cases, 
      respectively. This mutation spectrum is quite different from a previous report 
      concerning Koreans, but is similar to the distributions that are seen in several 
      ethnic populations worldwide. For a correct and effective diagnosis of SCAs, we 
      suggest that a molecular diagnosis be undertaken, even in patients without a 
      family history, as well as those with a family history. A stepwise approach is 
      also recommended. Patients with ataxia should be tested for SCA2 and SCA3. 
      Individuals testing negative should be tested for SCA1, SCA6, and SCA7.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of a combination of trimethoprim and 
      sulfamethoxazole in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph 
      disease (SCA3/MJD). DESIGN: Placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial in 
      22 patients with genetically confirmed SCA3/MJD. Study phases of 6 months were 
      separated by a washout period of 4 weeks. Dosages were a combination of 
      trimethoprim, 160 mg, and sulfamethoxazole, 800 mg, twice daily for 2 weeks, 
      followed by a combination of trimethoprim, 80 mg, and sulfamethoxazole, 400 mg, 
      twice daily for 5.5 months. SETTING: Outpatient department of the Neurological 
      Clinic, Ruhr-University, Bochum, Germany. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ataxia ranking 
      scale, self-assessment score, static posturography, and results of motor 
      performance testing. Effects on the visual system were studied using the 
      achromatic Vision Contrast Test System and the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test 
      for color discrimination. Physical and mental health were documented using the 
      Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. Subgroup analyses 
      assessed the influence of age, sex, age at onset, duration of the disease, 
      phenotype, and CAG repeat length on test performance. RESULTS: Twenty of 22 
      patients completed the study. Dropouts were due to a rash (placebo phase) and an 
      attempted suicide in a family conflict. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole therapy had 
      no significant effect in SCA3/MJD patients in the short-term analysis (2 weeks) 
      or in the long-term interval (6 months). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous 
      reports that studied smaller groups of patients, treatment with 
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not improve the diverse and complex movement 
      disorders caused by SCA3/MJD. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had no effect on the 
      visual system and cannot be recommended as a continuous treatment for SCA3/MJD 
      patients.

TI  - Frequency analysis of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias in Taiwanese patients 
      and clinical and molecular characterization of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 1105-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders. The mutational basis for most of these disorders is 
      an expanded CAG repeat sequence within the coding regions of the genes involved. 
      The prevalence of SCA in the ethnic Chinese on Taiwan remains unclear. Moreover, 
      there has been no report of SCA type 6 (SCA6) among Chinese people. OBJECTIVES: 
      To characterize the prevalence of SCA in the ethnic Chinese on Taiwan, and to 
      specifically characterize Chinese patients with SCA6 in terms of clinical and 
      molecular features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a molecular approach, we 
      investigated SCA in 74 Taiwanese families with dominantly inherited ataxias and 
      in 49 Taiwanese patients with sporadic ataxias. Clinical and molecular features 
      of SCA6 were further characterized in 12 patients from 8 families and in 2 
      sporadic cases. Furthermore, the intragenic polymorphic marker D19S1150 was 
      amplified by polymerase chain reaction to analyze for linkage disequilibrium. 
      RESULTS: Machado-Joseph disease-SCA3 was the most common type of autosomal 
      dominant SCA in the Taiwanese cohort, accounting for 35 cases (47.3%), followed 
      by SCA6 (8 [10.8%]), SCA2 (8 [10.8%]), SCA1 (4 [5.4%]), SCA7 (2 [2.7%]), 
      dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (1 [1.4%]), and SCA8 (0%). The genes 
      responsible for 16 (21.6%) of Taiwanese dominantly inherited SCA cases remain to 
      be determined. Among the 49 patients with sporadic ataxias in the present series, 
      2 (4.1%) were found to harbor SCA6 mutations. In the families with SCA6, we found 
      significant anticipation in the absence of genetic instability on transmission, 
      indicating that some other mechanism might account for the anticipation. The same 
      frequent allele of the intragenic DNA marker (D19S1150) was shared by 7 of 10 
      Taiwanese families with SCA6. CONCLUSIONS: Although SCA6 has, so far, not been 
      reported in mainland Chinese, we found a geographic cluster of families with SCA6 
      on Taiwan. Genotyping studies suggest a founder effect in the Taiwanese patients 
      with SCA6.

TI  - Inflammatory genes are upregulated in expanded ataxin-3-expressing cell lines and 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 brains.
PG  - 5389-96
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a polyglutamine disorder caused by a CAG 
      repeat expansion in the coding region of a gene encoding ataxin-3. To study 
      putative alterations of gene expression induced by expanded ataxin-3, we 
      performed PCR-based cDNA subtractive hybridization in a cell culture model of 
      SCA3. In rat mesencephalic CSM14.1 cells stably expressing expanded ataxin-3, we 
      found a significant upregulation of mRNAs encoding the endopeptidase matrix 
      metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), the transmembrane protein amyloid precursor protein, 
      the interleukin-1 receptor-related Fos-inducible transcript, and the cytokine 
      stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF1alpha). Immunohistochemical studies of 
      the corresponding or associated proteins in human SCA3 brain tissue confirmed 
      these findings, showing increased expression of MMP-2 and amyloid beta-protein 
      (Abeta) in pontine neurons containing nuclear inclusions. In addition, 
      extracellular Abeta-immunoreactive deposits were detected in human SCA3 pons. 
      Furthermore, pontine neurons of SCA3 brains strongly expressed the 
      antiinflammatory interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, the proinflammatory cytokine 
      interleukin-1beta, and the proinflammatory chemokine SDF1. Finally, increased 
      numbers of reactive astrocytes and activated microglial cells were found in SCA3 
      pons. These results suggest that inflammatory processes are involved in the 
      pathogenesis of SCA3.

      abnormal phenotype.
PG  - 805-7
AB  - We report on a Dutch family in which 4 members in 2 generations have intermediate 
      repeat lengths (53 and 54) for Machado-Joseph Disease/Spinocerebellar Ataxia 
      (MJD/SCA3). All but the youngest have a restless legs syndrome with 
      fasciculations and a sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy. Central neurological 
      abnormalities are only present in 2. This family shows that intermediate repeat 
      lengths can be pathogenic and may predispose for restless legs and peripheral 
      nerve disorder.

TI  - Neurologic findings in Machado-Joseph disease: relation with disease duration, 
      subtypes, and (CAG)n.
PG  - 899-904
AB  - CONTEXT: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      degeneration caused by an expanded CAG repeat on chromosome 14q32.1, is a 
      heterogeneous disorder for clinical manifestations. The reasons for the wide 
      range of neurologic findings in this disease are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To 
      explain part of this heterogeneity through the association of the neurologic 
      findings with sex, disease duration, age of onset, clinical type, and size of CAG 
      repeat expansion. DESIGN: A case-control study. SETTING: Ambulatory care. 
      PATIENTS: A consecutive sample of 62 patients with MJD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: 
      Neurologic signs. RESULTS: A direct relationship was found between the disease 
      duration and severity of gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia, 
      fasciculations, pyramidal syndrome, and ophthalmoplegia (P<.02). The most severe 
      forms of nuclear ophthalmoplegia were associated with type 1 MJD, whereas those 
      of supranuclear ophthalmoplegia were associated with type 3 MJD (P<.001). It was 
      also found that higher mean (CAG)(n) lengths were associated with worse degrees 
      of the pyramidal syndrome and dystonia (P<.001). The presence and severity of 
      nystagmus, eyelid retraction, rigidity and/or bradykinesia, and optic atrophy 
      were not clearly associated with any of the predictive variables under study. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Disease duration can explain part of the heterogeneity of ataxia, 
      dysarthria, dysphagia, fasciculations, pyramidal syndrome, and ophthalmoplegia, 
      in MJD. Type 1 MJD was positively associated with nuclear ophthalmoplegia; type 3 
      MJD was positively associated with supranuclear ophthalmoplegia. Higher mean CAG 
      lengths were found to correlate with the pyramidal syndrome and dystonia. 
      Nystagmus, eyelid retraction, rigidity and/or bradykinesia, and optic atrophy 
      were hardly attributable to any known reason or variable.

TI  - Restless legs syndrome in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, and 3.
PG  - 311-4
AB  - To identify the prevalence and determinants of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) we studied 58 patients with a molecular diagnosis of 
      SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3. Data on the symptoms of RLS were collected by a standardized 
      questionnaire, and RLS was diagnosed when patients met the four minimal criteria 
      of the syndrome as recently defined by an international study group. In addition, 
      we studied the relationship between RLS and age, age at ataxia onset, CAG repeat 
      length, and nerve conduction and evoked potentials data. RLS was significantly 
      more frequent in SCA patients than in controls (28% vs. 10%). Age at RLS onset in 
      SCA was 49.0 +/- 10.9 years. There were no significant differences in nerve 
      conduction or evoked potentials between RLS and non-RLS SCA patients. The 
      probability of developing RLS increased with age but not with CAG repeat length 
      or higher age of ataxia onset. The data provide evidence that patients with SCA1, 
      SCA2 and SCA3 are per se more susceptible to RLS than non-affected individuals. 
      The probability of developing RLS is related principally to the period over which 
      the CAG repeat mutation exerts its effect and not to CAG repeat length or age of 
      ataxia onset.

TI  - Clinical features and genetic analysis of a new form of spinocerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 234-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically 
      heterogeneous group of disorders. The mutations for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, and SCA-12 are identified and caused by an expansion of a CAG or a CTG 
      repeat sequence of these genes. Six additional loci for SCA4, SCA5, SCA-10, 
      SCA-11, SCA-13, and SCA-14 are mapped. The growing heterogeneity of the autosomal 
      dominant forms of these diseases shows that the genetic etiologies of at least 
      20% of ADCA have yet to be elucidated. METHODS: The authors ascertained and 
      clinically characterized a four-generation pedigree segregating an autosomal 
      dominant phenotype for SCA. Direct mutation analysis, repeat expansion detection 
      analysis, and linkage analysis for all known SCA loci were performed. RESULTS: 
      Direct mutational analysis excluded SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 12; genetic linkage 
      analysis excluded SCA4, 5,10, 11, 13, and 14, giving significant negative lod 
      scores. Examination of the family showed that all affected members had gait 
      ataxia and akinesia with variable features of dysarthria, hyporeflexia, and mild 
      intellectual impairment. Eye movements were normal. Head MRI showed atrophy of 
      the cerebellum without involvement of the brainstem. In 10 parent-child pairs, 
      median onset occurred 10.5 years earlier in offspring than in their parents, 
      suggesting anticipation. CONCLUSION: This family is distinct from other families 
      with SCA and is characterized by cerebellar ataxia and extrapyramidal signs.

TI  - Evidence that allelic variants of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 gene 
      influence susceptibility to multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 91-6
AB  - Expanded CAG trinucleotide repeats are known to be responsible for five of the 
      autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7). We 
      have typed each of these repeats in 226 multiple sclerosis sibling pair families. 
      No expanded repeats were seen, indicating an absence of SCA phenocopies in 
      clinically defined familial multiple sclerosis. However, transmission 
      disequilibrium testing for these repeats demonstrated significant excess 
      transmission of the 22 repeat length allele of the SCA2 gene (P=4. 4E-06) in 
      multiple sclerosis patients. This observation is consistent with pleiotropic 
      effects of the SCA2 gene, with a non-dynamic mutation/polymorphism contributing 
      epistatically to susceptibility in multiple sclerosis.

TI  - Extrapyramidal motor signs in degenerative ataxias.
PG  - 1495-500
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extrapyramidal motor signs (EPS) are well-known symptoms of 
      degenerative ataxia. However, little is known about frequency and appearance of 
      EPS in subtypes of ataxia. METHODS: We characterized 311 patients with ataxia 
      clinically and genetically. Course of the disease and EPS were investigated 
      according to a standardized protocol. Diagnostic and prognostic impact of EPS in 
      subtypes of ataxia was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier plots. RESULTS: Extrapyramidal 
      motor signs occurred in all forms of ataxia, but frequency and type of EPS varied 
      between genetically and clinically defined subtypes. Postural tremor in 
      hereditary ataxias was typical for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). Dystonia 
      was generally rare in ataxias, but, if present, suggested SCA3. We observed a 
      parkinsonian variant of SCA3 in which parkinsonism was present in the beginning 
      of the disease and responded well to levodopa therapy, leading to diagnostic 
      confusion. Parkinsonism in SCA3 was independent of CAG repeat length but ran in 
      families, suggesting modifying genes. In idiopathic sporadic cerebellar ataxia 
      (ISCA), EPS are more frequent in late-onset than in early-onset forms. In 50% of 
      ISCA patients with parkinsonism, the diagnosis of multiple system atrophy 
      remained questionable because of normal autonomic function. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Extrapyramidal motor signs can help to predict the genetic subtype of ataxia. 
      Extrapyramidal motor signs were more frequent in genetic subtypes in which basal 
      ganglia affection has been demonstrated by postmortem studies. However, no type 
      of EPS was specific for an underlying mutation. In ISCA, EPS are an adverse 
      prognostic factor. Parkinsonism is especially associated with a more rapid course 
      of the disease. Arch Neurol. 2000;57:1495-1500

TI  - Genetic background of apparently idiopathic sporadic cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 132-7
AB  - Disease-causing mutations have been identified in various entities of autosomal 
      dominant ataxia and in Friedreich's ataxia. However, no molecular pathogenic 
      factor is known to cause idiopathic cerebellar ataxias. We investigated the 
      CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats causing spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 
      8 and 12, and the GAA repeat of the frataxin gene in 124 patients apparently 
      suffering from idiopathic sporadic ataxia, including 20 patients with the 
      clinical diagnosis of multiple system atrophy. Patients with a positive family 
      history, a typical Friedreich phenotype, or symptomatic ataxia were excluded. 
      Genetic analyses uncovered the most common Friedreich mutation in 10 patients 
      with an age at onset between 13 and 36 years. The SCA6 mutation was present in 
      nine patients with disease onset between 47 and 68 years of age. The CTG repeat 
      associated with SCA8 was expanded in three patients. One patient had SCA2 
      attributable to a de novo mutation from a paternally transmitted, intermediate 
      allele. We did not identify the SCA1, SCA3, SCA7 or SCA12 mutation in idiopathic 
      sporadic ataxia patients. No trinucleotide repeat expansion was detected in the 
      MSA subgroup. This study has revealed the genetic basis in 19% of apparently 
      idiopathic ataxia patients. SCA6 is the most frequent mutation in late onset 
      cerebellar ataxia. The frataxin trinucleotide expansion should be investigated in 
      all sporadic ataxia patients with onset before age 40, even when the phenotype is 
      atypical for Friedreich's ataxia.

TI  - Analysis of CAG repeats in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia patients and distribution of CAG repeats at the SCA1, SCA2 
      and SCA6 loci in nine ethnic populations of eastern India.
PG  - 597-604
AB  - To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 57 unrelated 
      individuals clinically diagnosed as ataxia patients we analysed the SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci for expansion of CAG repeats. We detected CAG 
      repeat expansion in 6 patients (10.5%) at the SCA1 locus. Ten of the 57 patients 
      (17.5%) had CAG repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while four had CAG expansion 
      at the SCA3/MJD locus (7%). At the SCA6 locus there was a single patient (1.8%) 
      with 21 CAG repeats. We have not detected any patient with expansion in the SCA7 
      and DRPLA loci. To test whether the frequencies of the large normal alleles in 
      SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6 loci can reflect some light on prevalence of the subtypes of 
      SCAs we studied the CAG repeat variation in these loci in nine ethnic 
      sub-populations of eastern India from which the patients originated. We report 
      here that the frequency of large normal alleles (>31 CAG repeats) in SCA1 locus 
      to be 0.211 of 394 chromosomes studied. We also report that the frequency of 
      large normal alleles (>22 CAG repeats) at the SCA2 locus is 0.038 while at the 
      SCA6 locus frequency of large normal alleles (>13 repeats) is 0.032. We discussed 
      our data in light of the distribution of normal alleles and prevalence of SCAs in 
      the Japanese and white populations.

TI  - CAG repeat length in RAI1 is associated with age at onset variability in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2).
PG  - 1753-8
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by 
      the expansion of a polymorphic (CAG)(n) tract, which is translated into an 
      expanded polyglutamine tract in the ataxin-2 protein. Although repeat length and 
      age at disease onset are inversely related, approximately 50% of the age at onset 
      variance in SCA2 remains unexplained. Other familial factors have been proposed 
      to account for at least part of this remaining variance in the polyglutamine 
      dis-orders. The ability of polyglutamine tracts to interact with each other, as 
      well as the presence of intra-nuclear inclusions in other polyglutamine 
      disorders, led us to hypothesize that other CAG-containing proteins may interact 
      with expanded ataxin-2 and affect the rate of protein accumulation, and thus 
      influence age at onset. To test this hypothesis, we used step-wise multiple 
      linear regression to examine 10 CAG-containing genes for possible influences on 
      SCA2 age at onset. One locus, RAI1, contributed an additional 4.1% of the 
      variance in SCA2 age at onset after accounting for the effect of the SCA2 
      expanded repeat. This locus was further studied in SCA3/Machado-Joseph disease 
      (MJD), but did not have an effect on SCA3/MJD age at onset. This result 
      implicates RAI1 as a possible contributor to SCA2 neurodegeneration and raises 
      the possibility that other CAG-containing proteins may play a role in the 
      pathogenesis of other polyglutamine disorders.

PG  - 31-6
AB  - Two hundred and forty-eight patients from 116 Italian families with dominant 
      ataxia were studied for CAG expansion within SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 (spinocerebellar 
      ataxia) and DRPLA (dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy) genes. Fifty-six percent 
      of the families originated from Southern, 19% from Central and 25% from Northern 
      Italy. SCA2 was the commonest mutation, accounting for 47% of the families, 
      followed by SCA1 (24%), SCA6 (2%), SCA7 (2%) and DRPLA (1%). No SCA3 family was 
      found. Twenty-four percent of the families carried a still unidentified mutation. 
      When occurrence of mutations was evaluated according to the geographic origin, 
      SCA1 was the commonest in Northern (72%), whereas SCA2 was prevalent (63%) in 
      Southern Italy. The number of CAG repeats in SCA1 normal alleles was higher in 
      Northern than in Central-Southern Italy.

TI  - Decreased dopamine transporter binding in Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 994-8
AB  - The aim of this study was to use 99mTc-TRODAT-1 brain SPECT for investigation of 
      the binding of dopamine transporter (DAT) in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic 
      pathway of symptomatic Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) and to compare the results 
      with the abnormal cytidylate, adenylate, and guanylate (CAG) expansion in the 
      MJD1 gene and other clinical factors. METHODS: Ten symptomatic MJD patients (8 
      women, 2 men; age range, 20-71 y; mean age +/- SD, 36.4 +/- 10.6 y; mean duration 
      of illness, 9.8 +/- 5.4 y) and 21 healthy volunteers (age range, 24-71 y; mean 
      age, 47.6 +/- 20.1 y) were examined. Brain SPECT images were acquired 4 h after 
      injection. The ratio of specific to nonspecific nigrostriatal 99mTc-TRODAT-1 
      binding was measured and compared with the clinical symptoms, duration of 
      illness, and size of abnormal expanded CAG repeats. RESULTS: All nigrostriatal 
      99mTc-TRODAT-1 ratios were significantly lower in MJD patients than in healthy 
      volunteers (P < 0.05). Discriminant function analysis of all MJD patients showed 
      that the decreased binding of 99mTc-TRODAT-1 in the putamen was not significantly 
      different from that in the caudate nucleus. Eight of 10 MJD patients had 
      significantly decreased 99mTc-TRODAT-1 uptake. Of these 8, 2 had extrapyramidal 
      signs and 6 had no obvious extrapyramidal signs. The other 2 patients, who had 
      normal 99mTc-TRODAT-1 uptake, had no obvious extrapyramidal signs. CONCLUSION: 
      Our findings indicate that 99mTc-TRODAT-1 brain SPECT is an appropriate method 
      for evaluating damage to the nigrostriatal DAT in symptomatic MJD patients with 
      and without extrapyramidal signs. The decreased binding of 99mTc-TRODAT-1 in the 
      nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in symptomatic MJD patients correlates with 
      the phenotype of extrapyramidal signs but not with the abnormal CAG repeat 
      length, age at disease onset, or disease duration.

TI  - Prevalence of triplet repeat expansion in ataxia patients from Hokkaido, the 
      northernmost island of Japan.
PG  - 45-51
AB  - Approximately 44% of cases of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) in Hokkaido, the 
      northernmost island of Japan, were estimated to be inherited. To determine the 
      prevalence of triplet repeat expansion in hereditary SCA patients, we genotyped 
      seven genetically defined dominant SCAs in 349 patients, including 266 patients 
      from 77 families, 78 probands from unrelated families with hereditary late-onset 
      SCA, and five patients in whom a family history of SCA was not demonstrated. The 
      frequency of each disorder in a total of 155 unrelated families was 23.9% for 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), 29.0% for SCA6, 9.7% for SCA1, 7.7% for SCA2, and 
      2.6% for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. Abnormal expansion of triplet 
      repeats for SCA7 and SCA8 was not detected. A total of 27.1% of the patients had 
      still unknown SCA mutations. In addition, the GAA repeat in the frataxin gene was 
      not abnormally expanded in 13 early-onset SCA patients with clinical features 
      similar to those of Friedreich ataxia. Comparison of our results with those from 
      other centers handling SCA showed that MJD is prevalent throughout Japan, but the 
      frequencies of other dominant SCAs differ considerably even within Japan.

TI  - Frequency of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, and DRPLA CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in patients with hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia from Chinese 
      kindreds.
PG  - 540-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of SCA1 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 1), SCA2, 
      SCA3/MJD (spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, and 
      DRPLA (dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy) CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions 
      [(CAG)n] among persons diagnosed with hereditary SCA from Chinese families. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, 
      and DRPLA (CAG)n mutation were detected with the polymerase chain reaction, 
      highly denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and silver staining 
      technique in 167 patients with autosomal dominant SCA from 85 Chinese families 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA. RESULTS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (CAG)n 
      mutation in 7 patients from 4 kindreds (4.70%) was expanded to 53 to 62 repeats. 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (CAG)n mutation in 12 patients from 5 kindreds 
      (5.88%) was expanded to 42 to 47 repeats. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3/Machado-Joseph disease (CAG)n mutation in 83 patients from 41 kindreds (48.23%) 
      was expanded to 68 to 83 repeats. Sixty-five patients from 35 kindreds (41.19%) 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA did not test positive for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, 
      SCA6, SCA7, or DRPLA. There was a predictable inverse relationship between the 
      number of CAG repeats and the age at onset for SCA3/MJD and SCA2. Clinically, 
      dementia and hyporeflexia were more frequent in patients with SCA2, while 
      spasticity, hyperreflexia, and Babinski signs were more frequent in patients with 
      SCA3/ MJD, and those might be helpful in clinical work to primarily distinguish 
      patients with SCA3/MJD and SCA2 from others with different types of SCA. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of SCA3/MJD is substantially higher than that of SCA1 
      and SCA2 in patients with autosomal dominant SCA from Chinese kindreds, who are 
      non-Portuguese. Clinical expressions of the various types of SCAs overlap one 
      another; therefore, for clinical study it is important to make a gene diagnosis 
      and genetic classification for patients with SCA.

TI  - Absence of unidentified CAG repeat expansion in patients with Huntington's 
      disease-like phenotype.
PG  - 672-5
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by an expanded (CAG)n repeat on the huntingtin gene. It is characterised 
      by motor, psychiatric and cognitive disturbances. Diagnosis can be confirmed by 
      direct genetic testing, which is highly sensitive and specific and is now 
      considered definitive. This study focused on 21 patients presenting with a 
      clinical phenotype showing strong similarity to HD, but who do not have an 
      expanded CAG in the huntingtin gene. However, other possible diagnoses could be 
      evoked for most of them. Seven patients (3.5% of our cohort) could be considered 
      as phenocopies of HD with no alternative diagnosis. Samples were screened for 
      other triplet repeat diseases with similar presentation (DRPLA, SCA-1, SCA-2, 
      SCA-3, SCA-6, and SCA-7) and were all negative. The repeat expansion detection 
      technique (RED) was used to detect uncloned CAG repeat expansions and samples 
      were also analysed by polymerase chain reaction for expansions of the polymorphic 
      CAG-ERDA-1 and CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeats. RED expansion (>40 repeats) was 
      detected in only one patient. The results suggest that unstable CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions corresponding to known or unknown sequences are not involved in the 
      aetiology of HD-like disorders. It is hypothesised that some of these phenocopies 
      could correspond to mutations in other unidentified genes with other unstable 
      repeats (different from CAG) or in unknown genes with other mutations.

TI  - Characterization of the rat spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 gene.
PG  - 103-12
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) belongs to a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive cerebellar 
      ataxia. The disease-causing mutation has recently been identified as an unstable 
      and expanded (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat in a novel gene of unknown function. In 
      Caucasians, repeat expansions in the MJD1 gene have also been found in patients 
      with the clinically distinct autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 
      (SCA3). In order to gain insight into the biology of the MJD1/SCA3 gene we cloned 
      the rat homologue and studied its expression. The rat and human ataxin-3 genes 
      are highly homologous with an overall sequence identity of approximately 88%. 
      However, the C-terminal end of the putative protein differs strongly from the 
      published human sequence. The (CAG)n block in the rat cDNA consists of just three 
      interrupted units suggesting that a long polyglutamine stretch is not essential 
      for the normal function of the ataxin-3 protein in rodents. The expression 
      pattern of the SCA3 gene in various rat and human tissues was investigated by 
      Northern blot analyses. The mature transcript is approximately 6 kb in length. In 
      rat testis, a smaller transcript of 1.3 kb was identified. Transcription of rsca3 
      was detected in most rat tissues including brain. Analyzing the expression level 
      of the SCA3 gene in several human brain sections revealed no significant higher 
      mRNA level in regions predominantly affected in MJD. Thus additional molecules 
      and/or regulatory events are necessary to explain the exclusive degeneration of 
      certain brain areas.

TI  - Effects of heat shock, heat shock protein 40 (HDJ-2), and proteasome inhibition 
      on protein aggregation in cellular models of Huntington's disease.
PG  - 2898-903
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxias types 1 and 3 (SCA1, SCA3), 
      and spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) are caused by CAG/polyglutamine expansion 
      mutations. A feature of these diseases is ubiquitinated intraneuronal inclusions 
      derived from the mutant proteins, which colocalize with heat shock proteins 
      (HSPs) in SCA1 and SBMA and proteasomal components in SCA1, SCA3, and SBMA. 
      Previous studies suggested that HSPs might protect against inclusion formation, 
      because overexpression of HDJ-2/HSDJ (a human HSP40 homologue) reduced ataxin-1 
      (SCA1) and androgen receptor (SBMA) aggregate formation in HeLa cells. We 
      investigated these phenomena by transiently transfecting part of huntingtin exon 
      1 in COS-7, PC12, and SH-SY5Y cells. Inclusion formation was not seen with 
      constructs expressing 23 glutamines but was repeat length and time dependent for 
      mutant constructs with 43-74 repeats. HSP70, HSP40, the 20S proteasome and 
      ubiquitin colocalized with inclusions. Treatment with heat shock and lactacystin, 
      a proteasome inhibitor, increased the proportion of mutant huntingtin exon 
      1-expressing cells with inclusions. Thus, inclusion formation may be enhanced in 
      polyglutamine diseases, if the pathological process results in proteasome 
      inhibition or a heat-shock response. Overexpression of HDJ-2/HSDJ did not modify 
      inclusion formation in PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells but increased inclusion formation 
      in COS-7 cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an HSP increasing 
      aggregation of an abnormally folded protein in mammalian cells and expands the 
      current understanding of the roles of HDJ-2/HSDJ in protein folding.

TI  - A non-radioactive polymerase chain reaction method for diagnosis of 
      Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 705-7
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is caused by 
      unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the coding region of the MJD gene. 
      In this study, we describe a non-radioactive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      method to detect the CAG repeat range of the MJD gene. This technique allows 
      direct visualization of the PCR products on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels 
      within hours. In this study, genomic DNA samples isolated from peripheral 
      lymphocytes, amniotic fluid cells, and chorionic villi were tested with two sets 
      of commonly used MJD primers. PCR conditions were optimized, which resulted in 
      clear visualization of both the primer sets on 3% agarose gels. Ten out of 25 
      candidate MJD patients have been identified with this method to date, with no 
      false-positive or false-negative diagnoses. This simple, reliable, and 
      cost-effective method can be used for patient diagnosis, pre-symptomatic 
      diagnosis, and prenatal diagnosis.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I: oculomotor abnormalities in families 
      with SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3.
PG  - 789-97
AB  - Forty-six patients suffering from autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I 
      (ADCA I) underwent to a genotype-phenotype correlation analysis by molecular 
      genetic assignment to the spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, 2, or 3 (SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3) genetic locus and electro-oculography. Oculomotor deficits that are 
      attributed to dysfunction of cerebellar structures occurred in all three 
      mutations without major differences between the groups. Gaze-evoked nystagmus, 
      however, was not found to be associated with SCA2. Square wave jerks were 
      exclusively observed in SCA3. The gain in vestibulo-ocular reflex was 
      significantly impaired in SCA3 and SCA1. In SCA3 the severity of vestibular 
      impairment increased with CAG repeat length. Severe saccade slowing was a highly 
      characteristic feature of SCA2. In SCA3 saccade velocity was normal to mildly 
      reduced while SCA1 fell into an intermediate range. The present data show that 
      each mutation is associated with a distinct syndrome of oculomotor deficits. 
      Reduced saccade velocity and the absence of both square-wave jerks and 
      gaze-evoked nystagmus allow one SCA2 to be distinguished from SCA3 patients in 
      almost all cases. The eye movement disorder of SCA1 patients, however, overlaps 
      with both SCA2 and SCA3.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias in Spanish patients: genetic analysis of familial and 
      sporadic cases. The Ataxia Study Group.
PG  - 516-22
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically heterogeneous group 
      of neurodegenerative disorders caused by unstable CAG repeat expansions encoding 
      polyglutamine tracts. Five spinocerebellar ataxia genes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 
      and SCA7) and another related dominant ataxia gene (DRPLA) have been cloned, 
      allowing the genetic classification of these disorders. We present here the 
      molecular analysis of 87 unrelated familial and 60 sporadic Spanish cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia. For ADCA cases 15% were SCA2, 15% SCA3, 6% SCA1, 3% SCA7, 
      1% SCA6 and 1% DRPLA, an extremely rare mutation in Caucasoid populations. About 
      58% of ADCA cases remained genetically unclassified. All the SCA1 cases belong to 
      the same geographical area and share a common haplotype for the SCA1 mutation. 
      The expanded alleles ranged from 41 to 59 repeats for SCA1, 35 to 46 [corrected] 
      for SCA2, 67 to 77 for SCA3, and 38 to 113 for SCA7. One SCA6 case had 25 repeats 
      and one DRPLA case had 63 repeats. The highest CAG repeat variation in meiotic 
      transmission of expanded alleles was detected in SCA7, this being of +67 units in 
      one paternal transmission and giving rise to a 113 CAG repeat allele in a patient 
      who died at 3 years of age. Meiotic transmissions have also shown a tendency to 
      more frequent paternal transmission of expanded alleles in SCA1 and maternal in 
      SCA7. All SCA1 and SCA2 expanded alleles analyzed consisted of pure CAG repeats, 
      whereas normal alleles were interrupted by 1-2 CAT trinucleotides in SCA1, except 
      for three alleles of 6, 14 and 21 CAG repeats, and by 1-3 CAA trinucleotides in 
      SCA2. No SCA or DRPLA mutations were detected in the 60 sporadic cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia, but one late onset patient was identified as a recessive 
      form due to GAA-repeat expansions in the Friedreich's ataxia gene.

TI  - Insertion of expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat motifs into a yeast artificial 
      chromosome containing the human Machado-Joseph disease gene.
PG  - 53-61
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease or spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) is a progressive 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by pathological expansion of a trinucleotide 
      repeat motif present within exon 4 of the MJD1 gene. Previous attempts to create 
      a transgenic animal model have failed to produce a neurological deficit truly 
      representative of the disease phenotype. This appears to be the result of 
      inappropriate expression of the mutant protein in neuronal populations generally 
      spared in the disease state. Introduction of a human disease gene in the context 
      of a yeast artificial chromosome clone containing endogenous regulatory elements 
      would enhance the potential for correct tissue/cell-specific expression at 
      physiological levels. We report the introduction of expanded CAG repeat motifs 
      into a 250kb yeast artificial chromosome clone spanning the MJD1 locus using two 
      rounds of homologous recombination. Transformants exhibited both expansions and 
      contractions of the motif with alleles ranging in size from 48 to 84 repeat 
      units. The availability of these clones for modelling of the disease in 
      transgenic animals should allow elucidation of the role of repeat length in the 
      phenotypic spectrum of the disease.

TI  - Evidence for proteasome involvement in polyglutamine disease: localization to 
      nuclear inclusions in SCA3/MJD and suppression of polyglutamine aggregation in 
      vitro.
PG  - 673-82
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), 
      is one of at least eight inherited neurodegenerative diseases caused by expansion 
      of a polyglutamine tract in the disease protein. Here we present two lines of 
      evidence implicating the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in SCA3/MJD pathogenesis. 
      First, studies of both human disease tissue and in vitro models showed 
      redistribution of the 26S proteasome complex into polyglutamine aggregates. In 
      neurons from SCA3/MJD brain, the proteasome localized to intranuclear inclusions 
      containing the mutant protein, ataxin-3. In transfected cells, the proteasome 
      redistributed into inclusions formed by three expanded polyglutamine proteins: a 
      pathologic ataxin-3 fragment, full-length mutant ataxin-3 and an unrelated 
      GFP-polyglutamine fusion protein. Inclusion formation by the full-length mutant 
      ataxin-3 required nuclear localization of the protein and occurred within 
      specific subnuclear structures recently implicated in the regulation of cell 
      death, promyelocytic leukemia antigen oncogenic domains. In a second set of 
      experiments, inhibitors of the proteasome caused a repeat length-dependent 
      increase in aggregate formation, implying that the proteasome plays a direct role 
      in suppressing polyglutamine aggregation in disease. These results support a 
      central role for protein misfolding in the pathogenesis of SCA3/MJD and suggest 
      that modulating proteasome activity is a potential approach to altering the 
      progression of this and other polyglutamine diseases.

PG  - 222-4
AB  - To identify determinants of peripheral involvement in spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3/Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) the influence of CAG repeat length, age of 
      onset, disease duration and age on the results of nerve conduction studies was 
      analysed in 58 patients with SCA3/MJD. Patients with SCA3/MJD showed marked 
      reduction of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and sensory nerve action 
      potential (SNAP) amplitudes indicating axonal neuropathy of both motor and 
      sensory fibres. In addition, there was moderate slowing of nerve conduction 
      suggestive of mild peripheral demyelination. Multivariate regression showed that 
      CMAP and SNAP amplitudes decreased with age, but were not affected by CAG repeat 
      length, age of onset, or disease duration. The age related decline of CMAP and 
      SNAP amplitudes in SCA3/MJD was greater than in normal subjects. The data suggest 
      that the degree of peripheral damage in SCA3/MJD does not depend on CAG repeat 
      length, age of onset, or disease duration, but is mainly related to the time 
      period over which the SCA3/MJD mutation exerts its effect.

TI  - Mapping of a new autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia to chromosome 22.
PG  - 594-9
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) are a clinically and 
      genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. The clinical symptoms include 
      cerebellar dysfunction and associated signs from dysfunction in other parts of 
      the nervous system. So far, five spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) genes have been 
      identified: SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7. Loci for SCA4 and SCA5 have been 
      mapped. However, approximately one-third of SCAs have remained unassigned. We 
      have identified a Mexican American pedigree that segregates a new form of ataxia 
      clinically characterized by gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus. Two 
      individuals have seizures. After excluding all known genetic loci for linkage, we 
      performed a genomewide search and identified linkage to a 15-cM region on 
      chromosome 22q13. A maximum LOD score of 4.3 (recombination fraction 0) was 
      obtained for D22S928 and D22S1161. This distinct form of ataxia has been 
      designated "SCA10." Anticipation was observed in the available parent-child 
      pairs, suggesting that trinucleotide-repeat expansion may be the mutagenic 
      mechanism.

TI  - Incidence of dominant spinocerebellar and Friedreich triplet repeats among 361 
      ataxia families.
PG  - 1666-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 
      3, 6, and 7 and Friedreich's ataxia (FA) among a large panel of ataxia families. 
      BACKGROUND: The ataxias are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative diseases that variably affect the cerebellum, brainstem, and 
      spinocerebellar tracts. Trinucleotide repeat expansions have been shown to be the 
      mutational mechanism for five dominantly inherited SCAs as well as FA. METHODS: 
      We collected DNA samples and clinical data from patients representing 361 
      families with adult-onset ataxia of unknown etiology. Patients with a clinical 
      diagnosis of FA were specifically excluded from our collection. RESULTS: Among 
      the 178 dominant kindreds, we found SCA1 expansion at a frequency of 5.6%, SCA2 
      expansion at a frequency of 15.2%, SCA3 expansion at a frequency of 20.8%, SCA6 
      expansion at a frequency of 15.2%, and SCA7 expansion at a frequency of 4.5%. FA 
      alleles were found in 11.4% of apparently recessive and 5.2% of apparently 
      sporadic patients. Among these patients the repeat sizes for one or both FA 
      alleles were relatively small, with sizes for the smaller allele ranging from 90 
      to 600 GAA repeats. The clinical presentation for these patients is atypical for 
      FA, with one or more of the following characteristics: adult onset of disease, 
      retained tendon reflexes, normal plantar response, and intact or partially intact 
      sensory perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogenic trinucleotide repeat expansions were 
      found among 61% of the dominant kindreds. Among patients with apparently 
      recessive or negative family histories of ataxia, 6.8% and 4.4% tested positive 
      for a CAG expansion at one of the dominant loci, and 11.4 and 5.2% of patients 
      with apparently recessive or sporadic forms of ataxia had FA expansions. Because 
      of the significant implications that a dominant versus recessive inheritance 
      pattern has for future generations, it is important to screen patients who do not 
      have a clearly dominant inheritance pattern for expansions at both the FA and the 
      dominant ataxia loci.

      fossa structures and basal ganglia in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2 and 3.
PG  - 1687-93
AB  - Twenty-six patients suffering from autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I 
      were subjected to a genotype-phenotype correlation analysis using molecular 
      genetic assignment to the genetic loci for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, 2 or 3 
      (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3) and MRI-based volumetry of posterior fossa structures and 
      basal ganglia nuclei. There was significant atrophy of the cerebellum and 
      brainstem in all three SCA mutations compared with a group of 31 age- and 
      sex-matched controls. Comparison between the SCA groups showed that cerebellar 
      and brainstem atrophy was more severe in SCA2 than in SCA1 and SCA3. Putaminal 
      and caudate volume was reduced only in SCA3, but not in SCA1 and SCA2. A set of 
      three morphological criteria was defined that enabled us to assign all SCA2 and 
      SCA3 patients correctly to the underlying genotype. In contrast, these criteria 
      did not distinguish SCA1 from SCA2 and SCA3. Regression analysis failed to reveal 
      a significant association between CAG repeat length and the volumes of the 
      respective brain structures in any of the SCA mutant types. The present data 
      provide in vivo evidence that SCA2 and SCA3 lead to distinct patterns of brain 
      atrophy, while the atrophy changes in SCA1 overlap with both SCA2 and SCA3.

TI  - Close associations between prevalences of dominantly inherited spinocerebellar 
      ataxias with CAG-repeat expansions and frequencies of large normal CAG alleles in 
      Japanese and Caucasian populations.
PG  - 1060-6
AB  - To test the hypothesis that the frequencies of normal alleles (ANs) with a 
      relatively large number of CAG repeats (large ANs) are related to the prevalences 
      of the dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs)-SCA types 1, 2, 3 (Machado-Joseph 
      disease), 6, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA)-we investigated the 
      relative prevalences of these diseases in 202 Japanese and 177 Caucasian families 
      and distributions of the number of CAG repeats of ANs at these disease loci in 
      normal individuals in each population. The relative prevalences of SCA1 and SCA2 
      were significantly higher in Caucasian pedigrees (15% and 14%, respectively) than 
      in Japanese pedigrees (3% and 5%, respectively), corresponding to the observation 
      that the frequencies of large ANs of SCA1 (alleles >30 repeats) and of SCA2 
      (alleles >22 repeats) were significantly higher in Caucasians than in Japanese. 
      The relative prevalences of MJD/SCA3, SCA6, and DRPLA were significantly higher 
      in Japanese pedigrees (43%, 11%, and 20%, respectively) than in Caucasian 
      pedigrees (30%, 5%, and 0%, respectively), corresponding to the observation that 
      the frequencies of large ANs of MJD/SCA3 (>27 repeats), SCA6 (>13 repeats), and 
      DRPLA (>17 repeats) were significantly higher in Japanese than in Caucasians. The 
      close correlations of the relative prevalences of the dominant SCAs with the 
      distributions of large ANs strongly support the assumption that large ANs 
      contribute to generation of expanded alleles (AEs) and the relative prevalences 
      of the dominant SCAs.

TI  - CAG repeat expansions in patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 55-9
AB  - CAG repeat expansions cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), SCA2, SCA3, 
      SCA6 and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). So far these expansions 
      have been examined mainly in ataxia patients with a family history. However, some 
      sporadic cases with SCA have recently been reported. To elucidate the frequency 
      and characteristics of sporadic SCAs, we screened 85 Japanese ataxia patients 
      without a family history for the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and DRPLA mutations. As a 
      result, 19 patients (22%) were found to have expanded CAG repeats. Among sporadic 
      SCAs, the SCA6 mutation was most frequently observed. The sporadic SCA6 patients 
      had smaller CAG repeats and a later age of onset than SCA6 patients with an 
      established family history. We also identified one father-child pair in which 
      intermediate sized CAG repeats expanded into the SCA2 disease range during 
      transmission. These findings suggest that patients with ataxia even without a 
      family history should be examined for a CAG repeat expansion.

      huntingtin.
PG  - 215-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe characteristics of gene-negative patients with clinical 
      features of Huntington's disease (HD), exploring likely etiologies. BACKGROUND: 
      When a direct gene test became definitive for diagnosis of HD, we discovered a 
      number of patients in our clinics in Baltimore, MD, and Cambridge, UK, believed 
      or suspected to have HD who did not have the triplet repeat expansion. METHODS: 
      Patients were examined using standardized instruments, and given full neurologic 
      and psychiatric evaluations. Those negative for HD were tested for 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy, SCA-1, SCA-3, SCA-2, SCA-6, and other 
      conditions as indicated. RESULTS: Of 15 patients, 7 received specific diagnoses 
      or appear to be sporadic cases, 4 have a possible but uncertain relation to HD, 
      and 4 have unknown familial progressive movement disorders. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      last group of patients might be properly described as phenocopies of HD, some of 
      which may be caused by unidentified triplet repeat expansions.

TI  - Expanded polyglutamine protein forms nuclear inclusions and causes neural 
      degeneration in Drosophila.
PG  - 939-49
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3/MJD) is one of at least eight human 
      neurodegenerative diseases caused by glutamine-repeat expansion. We have 
      recreated glutamine-repeat disease in Drosophila using a segment of the SCA3/MJD 
      protein. Targeted expression of the protein with an expanded polyglutamine repeat 
      led to nuclear inclusion (NI) formation and late-onset cell degeneration. 
      Differential sensitivity to the mutant transgene was observed among different 
      cell types, with neurons being particularly susceptible; NI formation alone was 
      not sufficient for degeneration. The viral antiapoptotic gene P35 mitigated 
      polyglutamine-induced degeneration in vivo. Our results demonstrate that cellular 
      mechanisms of human glutamine-repeat disease are conserved in invertebrates. This 
      fly model will aid in identifying additional factors that modulate 
      neurodegeneration.

TI  - Analysis of SCA1, DRPLA, MJD, SCA2, and SCA6 CAG repeats in 48 Portuguese ataxia 
      families.
PG  - 134-8
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are clinically and genetically a heterogeneous 
      group of neurodegenerative disorders. To date, eight different loci causing SCA 
      have been identified: SCA1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA4, SCA5, 
      SCA6, SCA7, and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). Expansion of a CAG 
      repeat in the disease genes has been found in five of these disorders. To 
      estimate the relative frequencies of the SCA1, DRPLA, MJD, SCA2, and SCA6 
      mutations among Portuguese ataxia patients, we collected DNA samples from 48 
      ataxia families and performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of 
      the CAG repeat mutations on chromosomes 6p, 12p, 14q, 12q, and 19p, respectively. 
      Fifty-five individuals belonging to 34 dominant families (74%) had an expanded 
      CAG repeat at the MJD gene. In five individuals from two kindreds with a dominant 
      pattern of inheritance (4%), an expanded CAG repeat at the SCA2 gene was found. 
      In MJD patients, the normal allele size ranged from 13 to 41, whereas the mutant 
      alleles contained 65 to 80 repeats. For the SCA2 patients, normal alleles had 22 
      or 23, while expanded alleles had between 36 and 47 CAG units. We did not find 
      the SCA1, DRPLA, or SCA6 mutations in our group of families. The MJD mutation 
      remains the most common cause of SCA in Portugal, while a small number of cases 
      are caused by mutations at the SCA2 gene, and 22% are due to still unidentified 
      genes.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7): a neurodegenerative disorder with neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusions.
PG  - 913-8
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with progressive macular degeneration is 
      caused by a CAG/glutamine repeat expansion in the SCA7 gene/protein. Neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusions were detected in the brain of an early onset SCA7 case 
      with the 1C2 antibody directed against an expanded polyglutamine domain. Nuclear 
      inclusions were most frequent in the inferior olivary complex, a site of severe 
      neuronal loss in SCA7. They were also observed in other brain regions, including 
      the cerebral cortex, not considered to be affected in the disease. Using confocal 
      microscopy we showed that some inclusions were ubiquitinated, but to varying 
      degrees, ranging from <1% in the cerebral cortex to 60% in the inferior olive. In 
      addition, we also observed cytoplasmic staining using the 1C2 antibody, 
      particularly in the supramarginal gyrus, the hippocampus, the thalamus, the 
      lateral geniculate body and the pontine nuclei. These data confirm that the 
      presence of intranuclear inclusions in neurons is a common characteristic of 
      disorders caused by CAG/polyglutamine expansions, but unlike what has been 
      reported for Huntington's disease, SCA1 and SCA3/MJD, in SCA7 the inclusions were 
      not restricted to the sites of severe neuronal loss.

TI  - Machado-Joseph disease in three Scandinavian families.
PG  - 152-7
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative disorder characterized by varying age of onset and pronounced 
      phenotypic heterogeneity. The clinical core features include gait ataxia, 
      external ophthalmoplegia, nystagmus, and bulging eyes. Recently, Kawagushi et al. 
      (1994) cloned the MJD1 gene on chromosome 14 and MJD turned out to be the fifth 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by an unstable CAG repeat expansion. We have 
      studied two large Danish families and one Norwegian family with MJD. Three 
      features not previously associated with MJD are reported: dementia, generalized 
      muscle and joint pain, and in one case neuropathological examination revealed 
      atrophy of the inferior olives. We found a significant inverse correlation 
      between age of onset and the length of the CAG repeat expansion, and anticipation 
      is described through four succeeding generations. Instability of the CAG repeat 
      expansion was most pronounced at paternal transmission.

TI  - The natural history of degenerative ataxia: a retrospective study in 466 
      patients.
PG  - 589-600
AB  - The aim of the present study was (i) to compare disease progression and survival 
      in different types of degenerative ataxia, and (ii) to identify variables that 
      may modify the rate of disease progression. We included patients suffering from 
      Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA, n = 83), early onset cerebellar ataxia (EOCA, n = 30), 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) type I (ADCA-I, n = 273), ADCA-III (n 
      = 13) and multiple system atrophy (MSA, n = 67). Molecular genetic testing 
      allowed us to assign 202 ADCA-I patients to one of the following subgroups: 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type I (SCAI, n = 36), SCA2 (n = 56) and SCA3 (n = 110). 
      To assess disease progression we defined the following disease stages: stage 0 = 
      no gait difficulties; stage 1 = disease onset, as defined by onset of gait 
      difficulties; stage 2 = loss of independent gait; stage 3 = confinement to 
      wheelchair; stage 4 = death. Disease progression was most rapid in MSA, 
      intermediate in FRDA, ADCA-I and ADCA-III and slowest in EOCA. The rate of 
      progression was similar in SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3. The CAG repeat length was a 
      significant risk factor for faster progression in SCA2 and SCA3, but not in SCA1. 
      In FRDA, the time until confinement to wheelchair was shorter in patients with 
      earlier disease onset, suggesting that patients with long GAA repeats and early 
      disease onset have a poor prognosis. Female gender increased the risk of becoming 
      dependent on walking aids or a wheelchair, but it did not influence survival in 
      FRDA, SCA3 and MSA. In SCA2, female gender was associated with shortened 
      survival. In MSA, later age of onset increased the risk of rapid progression and 
      death.

TI  - Maternal anticipation in Machado-Joseph disease (MJD): some maternal factors 
      independent of the number of CAG repeat units may play a role in genetic 
      anticipation in a Japanese MJD family.
PG  - 141-5
AB  - We studied the relationship between the number of CAG repeat units in the MJD1 
      gene and clinical features of Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) in eight patients from 
      two generations of a Japanese MJD family. Because of lack of characteristic 
      clinical signs of MJD such as dystonia, bulging eyes or facial myokymia, clinical 
      diagnosis of MJD in this family was difficult to make prior to molecular testing 
      for the CAG repeat expansion in the MJD1 gene. All the patients exhibited 
      maternal transmission of MJD, and the intergenerational change in the number of 
      CAG repeat units in the MJD1 gene was very small (+0.5+/-0.3, mean+/-S.E.M., n=4) 
      in spite of marked genetic anticipation (-17.0 years/generation). In the present 
      family, the degree of anticipation per repeat unit in maternal transmissions was 
      much larger than that in maternal transmissions in the other six MJD families. 
      This indicates that some maternal factors other than the increase of the number 
      of CAG repeat units, which is known to be the basis of anticipation, may play a 
      role in genetic anticipation in this MJD family.

TI  - The role of the SCA2 trinucleotide repeat expansion in 89 autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia families. Frequency, clinical and genetic correlates.
PG  - 459-67
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is caused by a trinucleotide (CAG) 
      expansion in the coding region of the ataxin 2 gene on chromosome 12q.89 families 
      with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) types I, II and III, and 47 
      isolated cases with idiopathic late onset cerebellar ataxia (ILOCA), were 
      analysed for this mutation. The identification of the SCA2 mutation in 31 out of 
      38 families with the ADCA I phenotype, but in none of those with ADCA II, ADCA 
      III or ILOCA confirms the specificity of this mutation. A clinical comparison of 
      the ADCA I patients with the three known mutations (SCA1, -2 or -3) highlights 
      significant differences between the groups; SCA2 patients tended to have a longer 
      disease duration, a higher frequency of slow saccades and depressed tendon 
      reflexes. However, these neurological signs were also seen in an ADCA I family in 
      which the SCA2 mutation was not identified, illustrating the importance of a 
      direct genetic test. The SCA2 families were from different geographical and 
      ethnic backgrounds. However, haplotype analysis failed to show evidence of a 
      founder mutation, even in families from the same geographical origin. The range 
      of normal alleles varied from 17 to 30 CAG repeats and from 35 to 51 repeats for 
      the pathological alleles. Similar to the other diseases caused by unstable 
      trinucleotide repeats, a significant inverse correlation has been found between 
      the number of repeats and age of onset, and there is a significantly higher 
      paternal instability of repeat length on transmission to offspring. The SCA2 
      mutation is the most frequent amongst ADCA I patients, accounting for 40%, 
      compared with SCA1 and SCA3 which account for 35% and 15%, respectively.

TI  - Correlation of peripheral nerve fiber loss and trinucleotide repeats in 
      Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 59-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is a dominantly inherited cerebellar 
      ataxia associated with spasticity, ophthalmoplegia and dystonia. There has been 
      no report of electrophysiological or histological alterations of the peripheral 
      nervous system in patients with MJD. METHODS: Four patients with MJD were 
      identified by polymerase chain reaction. The peripheral nerves of these patients 
      were subjected to electrophysiological testing and histological study. 
      Correlation analyses were made between various clinical parameters and the 
      electrophysiological and histological changes. RESULTS: Electrophysiological 
      studies demonstrated a marked reduction of sensory action potential, acute 
      denervation changes on needle EMG, as well as mild decrease in the compound motor 
      action potential. Light microscopy of the sural nerves revealed clear loss of 
      myelinated fibers, and morphometry studies showed a loss of large myelinated 
      fibers. Moreover, the severity of these pathological changes was found to be 
      related to the CAG repeat length in the MJD gene. CONCLUSION: Our findings 
      indicated that the peripheral nervous system was frequently affected in patients 
      with MJD. These findings were similar to those seen in Friedreich's ataxia, 
      suggesting a loss of sensory and motor fibers probably following a lesion of the 
      dorsal root ganglion and the anterior horns in the spinal cord. Furthermore, the 
      number of CAG repeats seems to have an inverse relationship to the extent of 
      pathological changes of the peripheral nerves.

TI  - Large CAG/CTG repeat templates produced by PCR, usefulness for the DIRECT method 
      of cloning genes with CAG/CTG repeat expansions.
PG  - 1352-3
AB  - We report here a simple method for generating large CAG/CTG repeat sequences. We 
      have applied this method to clone the genomic sequence containing the CAG/CTG 
      repeat and its upstream intronic sequence present in spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3 or Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) by a modified DIRECT method. With these 
      modifications we have considerably simplified the generation of the repeat probe 
      used to screen for anomalous bands. This method will facilitate the molecular 
      approach to other genetic disorders where expansions of repeat sequences could be 
      involved.

TI  - Uncloned expanded CAG/CTG repeat sequences in autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia (ADCA) detected by the repeat expansion detection (RED) method.
PG  - 99-102
AB  - In some neurodegenerative diseases, genetic anticipation correlates with 
      expansions of the CAG/CTG repeat sequence above the normal range through the 
      generations of a pedigree. Among these neurodegenerative diseases are late onset 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA). ADCA are genetically heterogeneous 
      disorders with different cloned genes for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), 
      type 2 (SCA2), type 3 or Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), and type 6 (SCA6). 
      Another related dominant ataxia, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), 
      also shows CAG/CTG repeat expansions. Genetic anticipation has been reported for 
      all of them except for the recently cloned SCA6 gene. Other, as yet undetected 
      SCA genes may show the same features. We have used the repeat expansion detection 
      (RED) method to detect repeat expansions directly in DNA samples from ADCA 
      patients not resulting from known genes. Our sample consists of 19 affected index 
      cases, corresponding to 52.8% of our ADCA families without CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions in the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, or DRPLA genes. Eighty-nine percent 
      of the index cases had expansions of a CAG/CTG sequence greater than 40 repeats 
      by RED, while these were observed in only 26.9% of 78 healthy subjects from the 
      general population (p < 0.0001). The distribution of RED fragments in controls 
      and ADCA patients also shows significant differences with the Mann-Whitney U test 
      (U = 376.5, p = 0.0007). Moreover, there was a significant inverse correlation 
      between the size of expansion and the age of onset (r = -0.54, p = 0.018). These 
      results show CAG/CTG repeat expansions of over 40 repeats in our sample of ADCA 
      families not resulting from known SCA genes.

TI  - Progressive atrophy of cerebellum and brainstem as a function of age and the size 
      of the expanded CAG repeats in the MJD1 gene in Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 288-96
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized by cerebellar ataxia associated to varying degrees with pyramidal 
      signs, extrapyramidal signs, or peripheral amyotrophy. It is caused by unstable 
      expansion of the CAG repeat in the MJD1 gene on chromosome 14q32.1. To determine 
      how the neurodegenerative process in the central nervous system of patients with 
      MJD correlates with the size of expanded CAG repeats in the MJD1 gene and other 
      factors, we performed detailed quantitative analyses of findings of magnetic 
      resonance imaging of the central nervous system of 21 patients with MJD of 
      various ages and with various sizes of expanded CAG repeats. We found that 
      atrophy of the brainstem and cerebellar vermis in MJD patients is closely 
      correlated not only with the size of expanded CAG repeat in the MJD1 gene but 
      also with patient age, which suggests that the neurodegenerative process in MJD 
      is regulated by the size of expanded CAG repeats as well as by the patient age.

TI  - CAG repeat length and disease duration in Machado-Joseph disease: a new clinical 
      classification.
PG  - 166-71
AB  - To evaluate the clinical characteristics of Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) with 
      reference to CAG repeat length and disease duration, we analyzed neurologic 
      findings in 108 patients from 84 families. The majority of MJD patients presented 
      with an ataxic gait as the initial symptom. Dysarthria and nystagmus were 
      observed from an early stage. Bulging eyes, muscle atrophy and bradykinesia 
      developed later. Patients with a shorter CAG repeat length or later onset had 
      more frequent involvement of proprioceptive sensory deficit. Incidence of 
      abnormal reflexes, tones, and proprioceptive sensation was not associated with 
      disease duration, but with CAG repeat length. Based on these results, we propose 
      a new clinical classification: type A (juvenile type), with hyperreflexia and 
      dystonia, but without a proprioceptive sensory deficit; type C (adult type), with 
      hyporeflexia and a proprioceptive sensory deficit, but without dystonia; and type 
      B (intermediate type), the remaining patients with a mixed presentation.

TI  - Somatic mosaicism of the CAG repeat expansion in spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3/Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 23-7
AB  - An expanded and unstable CAG repeat in the coding region of the MJD1 gene is the 
      mutation responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia 3/Machado-Joseph disease. In 
      order to determine whether there was a higher degree of instability in affected 
      regions, the size of the expanded CAG repeat was analyzed in different regions of 
      the central nervous system, in two unrelated SCA3/MJD patients. The degree of 
      somatic mosaicism was quantified and compared to that in a SCA1 patient. 
      Instability of the expanded CAG repeat was observed in peripheral tissues as well 
      as in CNS of the three patients, but there was no correlation between the degree 
      of mosaicism and the selective vulnerability of CNS structures. As in the other 
      diseases caused by expanded CAG repeats, a lower degree of mosaicism was found in 
      the cerebellar cortex of both SCA1 and SCA3/MJD patients, probably reflecting 
      specific properties of this structure. In SCA3/MJD, the degree of mosaicism 
      seemed to correlate with age at death rather than with the size of the expanded 
      CAG repeat. Finally, somatic instability was more pronounced in SCA1 than in 
      SCA3/MJD patients.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6: genotype and phenotype in German kindreds.
PG  - 67-73
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is an autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) of which the mutation causing the disease has recently 
      been characterised as an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the gene coding for 
      the alpha1A-subunit of the voltage dependent calcium channel. The aim was to 
      further characterise the SCA6 phenotype METHODS: The SCA6 mutation was 
      investigated in 69 German families with ADCA and 61 patients with idiopathic 
      sporadic cerebellar ataxia and the CAG repeat length of the expanded allele was 
      correlated with the disease phenotype. RESULTS: Expanded alleles were found in 
      nine of 69 families as well as in four patients with sporadic disease. Disease 
      onset ranged from 30 to 71 years of age and was significantly later than in other 
      forms of ADCA. Age at onset correlated inversely with repeat length. The SCA6 
      phenotype comprises predominantly cerebellar signs in concordance with isolated 
      cerebellar atrophy on MRI. Non-cerebellar systems were only mildly affected with 
      external ophthalmoplegia, spasticity, peripheral neuropathy, and parkinsonism. 
      Neither these clinical signs nor progression rate correlated with CAG repeat 
      length. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first detailed characterisation of 
      the SCA6 phenotype. Clinical features apart from cerebellar signs were highly 
      variable in patients with SCA6. By comparison with SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 no 
      clinical or electrophysiological finding was specific for SCA6. Therefore, the 
      molecular defect cannot be predicted from clinical investigations. In Germany, 
      SCA6 accounts for about 13% of families with ADCA. However, up to 30% of SCA6 
      kindreds may be misdiagnosed clinically as sporadic disease due to late 
      manifestation in apparently healthy parents. Genetic testing is therefore 
      recommended for the SCA6 mutation also in patients with putative sporadic ataxia.

TI  - Polymorphisms at 13 expressed human sequences containing CAG/CTG repeats and 
      analysis in autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) patients.
PG  - 18-21
AB  - Genetic anticipation--increasing severity and a decrease in the age of onset with 
      successive generations of a pedigree--is clearly present in autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia (ADCA). Anticipation is correlated with expansion of the 
      CAG/CTG repeat sequence to sizes above those in the normal range through the 
      generations of a pedigree. Genetic heterogeneity has been demonstrated for ADCA, 
      with four cloned genes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, and SCA6) and three mapped loci 
      (SCA4, SCA5 and SCA7). Another related dominant ataxia, 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), presents anticipation with CAG/CTG 
      repeat expansions. We had previously analysed ADCA patients who had not shown 
      repeat expansions in cloned genes for CAG/CTG repeat expansions by the repeat 
      expansion detection method (RED) and had detected expansions of between 48 and 88 
      units in 17 unrelated familial cases. We present here an analysis of 13 genes and 
      expressed sequence tags (ESTs) containing 10 or more CAG/CTG repeat sequences 
      selected from public databases in the 17 unrelated ADCA patients. Of the 13 
      selected genes and ESTs, 9 were found to be polymorphic with heterozygosities 
      ranging between 0.09 and 0.80 and 2 to 17 alleles. In ADCA patients none of the 
      loci showed expansions above the normal range of the CAG/CTG repeat sequences, 
      excluding them as the mutation causing ADCA.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6. Molecular and clinical features of 35 Japanese 
      patients including one homozygous for the CAG repeat expansion.
PG  - 1238-43
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a newly classified autosomal-dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) associated with CAG repeat expansion. We screened 111 
      patients with cerebellar ataxia for the SCA6 mutation. Of these, 35 patients were 
      found to have expanded CAG repeats in the SCA6 gene, indicating that second to 
      SCA3, SCA6 is the most common ADCA in Japan. Expanded alleles ranged from 21 to 
      29 repeats, whereas normal alleles had seven to 17 repeats. There was no change 
      in the CAG repeat length during meiosis. The age at onset was inversely 
      correlated with the repeat length. The main clinical feature of the 35 patients 
      with SCA6 was slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia; multisystem involvement was 
      not common. The 35 patients included nine cases without apparent family history 
      of cerebellar ataxia. The sporadic cases had smaller CAG repeats (21 or 22 
      repeats) and a later age at onset (64.9 +/- 4.9 years) than the other cases with 
      established family history. We also identified one patient who was homozygous for 
      the SCA6 repeat expansion. The homozygote showed an earlier age of onset and more 
      severe clinical manifestations than her sister, a heterozygote carrying an 
      expanded allele with the same repeat length as the homozygote. This finding 
      suggests that the dosage of the CAG repeat expansion plays an important role in 
      phenotypic expression in SCA6.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia: phenotypic differences in genetically 
      defined subtypes?
PG  - 924-32
AB  - Seventy-seven families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia were analyzed 
      for the CAG repeat expansions causing spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 
      and 6. The SCA1 mutation accounted for 9%, SCA2 for 10%, SCA3 for 42%, and SCA6 
      for 22% of German ataxia families. Seven of 27 SCA6 patients had no family 
      history of ataxia. Age at onset correlated inversely with repeat length in all 
      subtypes. Yet the average effect of one CAG unit on onset age was different for 
      each SCA subtype. We compared clinical, electrophysiological, and magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) findings to identify phenotypic characteristics of 
      genetically defined SCA subtypes. Slow saccades, hyporeflexia, myoclonus, and 
      action tremor proposed SCA2. SCA3 patients frequently developed diplopia, severe 
      spasticity or pronounced peripheral neuropathy, and impaired temperature 
      discrimination, apart from ataxia. SCA6 presented with a predominantly cerebellar 
      syndrome and patients often had onset after 55 years of age. SCA1 was 
      characterized by markedly prolonged peripheral and central motor conduction times 
      in motor evoked potentials. MRI scans showed pontine and cerebellar atrophy in 
      SCA1 and SCA2. In SCA3, enlargement of the fourth ventricle was the main sequel 
      of atrophy. SCA6 presented with pure cerebellar atrophy on MRI. However, overlap 
      between the four SCA subtypes was broad.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6: CAG repeat expansion in alpha1A voltage-dependent 
      calcium channel gene and clinical variations in Japanese population.
PG  - 879-84
AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are clinically and genetically 
      a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, mild CAG repeat 
      expansion in the alpha1A voltage-dependent calcium channel gene has been found to 
      be associated with a type of autosomal dominant SCA (SCA6). We analyzed 98 
      Japanese families with autosomal dominant SCAs, for whom CAG repeat expansions of 
      the SCA1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy genes were excluded, and 5 apparently sporadic cases of cortical 
      cerebellar atrophy. The diagnosis of SCA6 was confirmed in 30 families (31%) 
      comprising 47 affected individuals and 1 sporadic case. The size of expanded CAG 
      repeats ranged from 21 to 26 repeat units and was found to be correlated 
      inversely with age at onset. We identified 2 SCA6 patients homozygous for 
      expanded CAG repeats, whose ages at onset were earlier than the 95% lower 
      confidence level, suggesting the presence of a gene dosage effect of expanded CAG 
      repeat. Ataxia is the most common initial symptom found in 45 of the 48 patients. 
      Patients with a prolonged disease course showed other accompanying clinical 
      features including dystonic postures, involuntary movements, and abnormalities in 
      tendon reflexes.

AB  - We performed [18F]6-fluoro-L-dopa (6-FD) and [11C]raclopride (RAC) PET studies in 
      six patients with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) (age, 17 to 61 years; duration of 
      illness, 3 to 10 years), normal controls (n = 10 in 6-FD-PET, n = 8 in RAC-PET), 
      and patients with idiopathic parkinsonism (n = 15 in 6-FD-PET). The youngest 
      patient with MJD had prominent dystonia and pyramidal features (type 1 MJD), 
      whereas the remainder were prominently ataxic (types 2 and 3 MJD). Striatal RAC 
      binding was normal in patients with MJD. Striatal 6-FD influx constants (Ki) were 
      low in the range of idiopathic parkinsonism in two patients with MJD (youngest 
      and oldest patients), whereas striatal Ki were normal in the remaining patients 
      with MJD. The impairment of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway did not 
      correlate with the phenotype, CAG repeat length, disease duration, or age of 
      onset of patients with MJD. Our results suggest that striatal D2 receptors are 
      normal and the nigral damage is diverse in MJD.

TI  - The expansion of the CAG repeat in ataxin-2 is a frequent cause of autosomal 
      dominant spinocerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 1009-13
AB  - The autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (ADSCAs) are a heterogeneous group 
      of late-onset neurodegenerative disorders with overlapping clinical features. 
      Genetic linkage studies have identified at least seven distinct loci for the 
      ADSCAs, allowing the genetic classification of these disorders. The 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) locus was mapped to chromosome 12, and a 
      gene responsible for this disorder was recently isolated. The mutation causing 
      SCA2 is an expansion of a trinucleotide CAG repeat contained within the coding 
      region of a novel gene. We describe the results of genotypic analysis for the 
      SCA2 repeat in individuals with ADSCA who were previously found negative for CAG 
      repeat expansions in the SCA1, SCA3, or SCA6 genes. The expanded CAG repeat has 
      been identified in 15 independent families. Repeat instability and anticipation 
      were observed in two large kindreds. The SCA2 mutation was found in 18% of our 
      ADSCA kindreds, confirming the high proportion of SCA2 among this group of 
      disorders.

      ataxia type 3.
PG  - 333-44
AB  - The mechanism of neurodegeneration in CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion diseases 
      is unknown but is thought to occur at the protein level. Here, in studies of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), 
      we show that the disease protein ataxin-3 accumulates in ubiquitinated 
      intranuclear inclusions selectively in neurons of affected brain regions. We 
      further provide evidence in vitro for a model of disease in which an expanded 
      polyglutamine-containing fragment recruits full-length protein into insoluble 
      aggregates. Together with recent findings from transgenic models, our results 
      suggest that intranuclear aggregation of the expanded protein is a unifying 
      feature of CAG/polyglutamine diseases and may be initiated or catalyzed by a 
      glutamine-containing fragment of the disease protein.

TI  - SCA6 is caused by moderate CAG expansion in the alpha1A-voltage-dependent calcium 
      channel gene.
PG  - 1289-93
AB  - Recently, moderate (CAG)>20 repeat expansions in the alpha1A-voltage-dependent 
      calcium channel gene (CACNL1A4) have been identified in a previously unmapped 
      type of SCA which has been named SCA6. We investigated the (CAG)n repeat length 
      of the CACNL1A4 gene in 733 patients with sporadic ataxia and in 46 German 
      families with dominantly inherited SCA which do not harbor the SCA1, SCA2, or 
      MJD1/SCA3 mutation, respectively. The SCA6 (CAG)n expansion was identified in 32 
      patients most frequently with late manifestation of the disease. The (CAG)n 
      stretch of the affected allele varied between 22 and 28 trinucleotide units and 
      is therefore the shortest trinucleotide repeat expansion causing spinocerebellar 
      ataxia. The (CAG)n repeat length is inversely correlated with the age at onset. 
      In 11 parental transmissions of the expanded allele no repeat instability has 
      been observed. Repeat instability was also not found for the normal allele 
      investigating 431 meioses in the CEPH families. Analyzing 248 apparently healthy 
      octogenerians revealed one allele of 18 repeats which is the longest normal CAG 
      repeat in the CACNL1A4 gene reported. The SCA6 mutation causes the disease in 
      approximately 10% of autosomal dominant SCA in Germany. Most importantly, the 
      trinucleotide expansion was observed in four ataxia patients without obvious 
      family history of the disease which necessitates a search for the SCA6 (CAG)n 
      expansion even in sporadic patients.

TI  - Studies of the CAG repeat in the Machado-Joseph disease gene in Taiwan.
PG  - 155-62
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      degeneration characterized by cerebellar ataxia and pyramidal signs associated in 
      varying degrees with a dystonic-rigid extrapyramidal syndrome or peripheral 
      amyotrophy. Unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the MJD gene on the 
      long arm of chromosome 14 has been identified as the pathological mutation for 
      MJD. While investigating the distribution of CAG repeat lengths of the MJD gene 
      in Taiwan's population, we have identified 18 MJD-affected patients and 12 
      at-risk individuals in seven families. In addition, we have analyzed the range of 
      CAG repeat lengths in 96 control individuals. The CAG repeat number ranged from 
      13 to 44 in the controls and 72-85 in the affected and at-risk individuals. Our 
      results indicated that the CAG repeat number was inversely correlated with the 
      age of onset. The differences in CAG repeat length between parent and child and 
      between siblings are greater with paternal transmission than maternal 
      transmission. Our data show a tendency towards the phenomenon of anticipation in 
      the MJD families but do not support unidirectional expansion of CAG repeats 
      during transmission. We also demonstrated that PCR amplification of the CAG 
      repeats in the MJD gene from villous DNA was possible and might prove useful as a 
      diagnostic tool for affected families in the future.

TI  - Expanded CAG repeats in spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1) segregate with distinct 
      haplotypes in South african families.
PG  - 131-7
AB  - The autosomal dominant late onset spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are genetically 
      heterogeneous. Three genes, SCA1 on 6p, SCA2 on 12q and MJD1 on 14q, have been 
      isolated for SCA1, SCA2 and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), respectively. In these 
      three autosomal dominant disorders the mutation is an expanded CAG repeat. 
      Evidence for heterogeneity in families not linked to the SCA1, SCA2 and MJD loci 
      is provided by the mapping of SCA loci to chromosomes 16q, 11cen and 3p. A total 
      of 14 South African kindreds and 22 sporadic individuals with SCA were 
      investigated for the expanded SCA1 and MJD repeats. None of the families nor the 
      sporadic individuals showed expansion of the MJD repeat. Expanded SCA1 and CAG 
      repeats were found to cosegregate with the disorder in six of the families tested 
      and were also observed in one sporadic individual with a negative family history 
      of SCA. The use of the microsatellite markers D6S260, D6S89 and D6S274 provided 
      evidence that the expanded SCA1 repeats segregated with three distinct haplotypes 
      in the six families. Use of the highly polymorphic tightly linked microsatellite 
      markers is still important as this stage, particularly where this coincides with 
      the possibility of a homozygous genotype with the trinucleotide repeat marker. 
      Importantly, our molecular findings indicate: (1) an absence of MJD expanded 
      repeats underlying SCA; (2) the major disease in this group is due to mutations 
      in the SCA1 gene; and (3) the familial disorder in the majority population group 
      (i.e. mixed ancestry) in the Western Cape region of South Africa is most likely 
      to be the result of two distinct founder events.

TI  - Single sperm analysis of the CAG repeats in the gene for Machado-Joseph disease 
      (MJD1): evidence for non-Mendelian transmission of the MJD1 gene and for the 
      effect of the intragenic CGG/GGG polymorphism on the intergenerational 
      instability.
PG  - 1063-8
AB  - To investigate the mechanism of the meiotic instability of expanded CAG repeats 
      in the gene for Machado-Joseph disease (MJD1), we analyzed the CAG repeat sizes 
      of 1036 single sperm from six individuals with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). The 
      segregation ratio between single sperm with an expanded allele and those with a 
      normal allele is significantly different (P <0.0001) from the expected 1:1 
      segregation ratio, which demonstrates segregation distortion of expanded alleles 
      in male meiosis. In single sperm from individuals with the [expanded 
      (CAG)n-CGG]/[normal (CAG)n-GGG] genotype, significantly greater instability of 
      the CAG repeat was observed compared with single sperm from individuals with the 
      [expanded (CAG)n-CGG]/[normal (CAG)n-CGG] genotype (F-test, P <0.001). These 
      findings in single sperm confirm non-Mendelian transmission of the MJD1 gene and 
      the effect of the intragenic CGG/GGG polymorphism on the intergenerational 
      instability of the CAG repeats in the MJD1 gene, which have been observed in 
      clinical and genetic studies. Our results indicate similarities and 
      dissimilarities between MJD and Huntington's disease or myotonic dystrophy in 
      terms of the inter-allelic interaction, segregation distortions and size 
      distribution of trinucleotide repeats in mutant alleles. Further study is 
      required to determine whether there is a common mechanism underlying the 
      instability of the triplet repeats in 'triplet repeat diseases'.

TI  - SCA2 trinucleotide expansion in German SCA patients.
PG  - 59-64
AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a group of clinically and 
      genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders which lead to progressive 
      cerebellar ataxia. A gene responsible for SCA type 2 has been mapped to human 
      chromosome 12 and the disease causing mutation has been identified as an unstable 
      and expanded (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat. We investigated the (CAG)n repeat 
      length of the SCA2 gene in 842 patients with sporadic ataxia and in 96 German 
      families with dominantly inherited SCA which do not harbor the SCA1 or MJD1/SCA3 
      mutation, respectively. The SCA2 (CAG)n expansion was identified in 71 patients 
      from 54 families. The (CAG)n stretch of the affected allele varied between 36 and 
      64 trinucleotide units. Significant repeat expansions occurred most commonly 
      during paternal transmission. Analysis of the (CAG)n repeat lengths with the age 
      of onset in 41 patients revealed an inverse correlation. Two hundred and 
      forty-one apparently healthy octogenerians carried alleles between 16 and 31 
      repeats. One 50-year old, healthy individual had 34 repeats; she had transmitted 
      an expanded allele to her child. The small difference between 'normal' and 
      disease alleles makes it necessary to define the extreme values of their ranges. 
      With one exception, the trinucleotide expansion was not observed in 842 ataxia 
      patients without a family history of the disease. The SCA2 mutation causes the 
      disease in nearly 14% of autosomal dominant SCA in Germany.

TI  - Brain regional differences in the expansion of a CAG repeat in the 
      spinocerebellar ataxias: dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, Machado-Joseph 
      disease, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1.
PG  - 505-11
AB  - Three autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA), Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 
      (SCA1), are associated with the expansion of a CAG repeat in the respective 
      genes. To investigate the association between CAG repeat expansion and 
      neuropathological findings, we analyzed several brain regions from 9 cases of 
      DRPLA, 3 cases of MJD, and 1 case of SCA1. We found that the expanded alleles 
      were smaller in the cerebellar cortex than in other brain regions, such as the 
      frontal cortex, in these three diseases. The discrepancy in the expanded CAG 
      repeat length between cerebellar cortex and other tissues was most prominent in 
      DRPLA, and especially in cases of adult-onset DRPLA. A significant correlation 
      was found between the age at onset of DRPLA and the size of the CAG repeat 
      expansion. Cerebella of DRPLA patients were microscopically dissected into three 
      layers, the molecular and granular layers and the white matter, which were 
      analyzed separately. The lower level of CAG repeat expansion in DRPLA cerebella 
      was representative of CAG repeat expansion in the granule cells. The 
      microdissected samples of the granular layer of the hippocampal formation, which 
      is densely packed with neuronal cells, revealed that the degree of CAG repeat 
      expansion in this layer was similar to that in the cerebellum. These observations 
      suggest that granule cells in the cerebellum and hippocampus have low levels of 
      CAG repeat expansion, and that other types of cells exhibit a higher level of CAG 
      repeat expansion, in spinocerebellar ataxias.

TI  - The prevalence and wide clinical spectrum of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      trinucleotide repeat in patients with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 842-50
AB  - The dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) represent a clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of disorders linked by progressive deterioration in balance 
      and coordination. The utility of genetic classification of the ADCAs has been 
      highlighted by the striking variability in clinical phenotype observed within 
      families and the overlap in clinical phenotype observed between those with 
      different genotypes. The recent demonstration that spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      (SCA2) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion within the ataxin-2 gene has allowed 
      us to determine the frequency of SCA2 compared with SCA1, SCA3/Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD), and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) in patients with 
      sporadic and inherited ataxia. SCA2 accounts for 13% of patients with ADCA 
      (without retinal degeneration), intermediate between SCA1 and SCA3/MJD, which 
      account for 6% and 23%, respectively. Together, SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3/MJD 
      constitute >40% of the mutations leading to ADCA I in our population. No patient 
      without a family history of ataxia, or with a pure cerebellar or spastic 
      syndrome, tested positive for SCA1, SCA2, or SCA3. No overlap in ataxin-2 allele 
      size between normal and disease chromosomes, or intermediate-sized alleles, were 
      observed. Repeat length correlated inversely with age at onset, accounting for 
      approximately 80% of the variability in onset age. Haplotype analysis provided no 
      evidence for a single founder chromosome, and diverse ethnic origins were 
      observed among SCA2 kindreds. In addition, a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes 
      was observed among SCA2 patients, including typical mild dominant ataxia, the MJD 
      phenotype with facial fasciculations and lid retraction, and early-onset ataxia 
      with a rapid course, chorea, and dementia.

TI  - Non-Mendelian transmission at the Machado-Joseph disease locus in normal females: 
      preferential transmission of alleles with smaller CAG repeats.
PG  - 234-6
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, is a 
      neurodegenerative disorder which is associated with a CAG repeat expansion in the 
      MJD1 gene on chromosome 14q32.1. A recent study reported an excess of 
      transmission of disease chromosomes relative to normal chromosomes from affected 
      fathers, while this phenomenon was not observed in female meioses. These data 
      were compatible with meiotic drive. We investigated the transmission of alleles 
      with larger versus smaller CAG repeat numbers in the MJD1 gene in normal 
      heterozygotes from the 40 CEPH families. Our data suggest that there was no 
      segregation distortion in male meioses, while the smaller CAG allele was 
      inherited in 57% of female meioses (p < 0.016). The pattern of inheritance of 
      smaller versus larger CAG alleles at this locus was significantly different when 
      male and female meioses were compared (p = 0.0139). While previous data suggest 
      that meiotic drive may be a feature of certain human diseases, including the 
      trinucleotide diseases MJD, myotonic dystrophy, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy, these data are compatible with meiotic drive also occurring among 
      non-disease associated CAG sizes.

TI  - Instability of highly expanded CAG repeats in mice transgenic for the 
      Huntington's disease mutation.
PG  - 197-200
AB  - Six inherited neurodegenerative diseases are caused by a CAG/polyglutamine 
      expansion, including spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), Huntington's 
      disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), dentatorubral pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA) Machado-Joseph disease (MJD or SCA3) and SCA2. Normal and 
      expanded HD allele sizes of 6-39 and 35-121 repeats have been reported, and the 
      allele distributions for the other diseases are comparable. Intergenerational 
      instability has been described in all cases, and repeats tend to be more unstable 
      on paternal transmission. This may present as larger increases on paternal 
      inheritance as in HD, or as a tendency to increase on male and decrease on female 
      transmission as in SCA1 (ref. 15). Somatic repeat instability is also apparent 
      and appears most pronounced in the CNS. The major exception is the cerebellum, 
      which in HD, DRPLA, SCA1 and MJD has a smaller repeat relative to the other brain 
      regions tested. Of non-CNS tissues, instability was observed in blood, liver, 
      kidney and colon. A mouse model of CAG repeat instability would be helpful in 
      unravelling its molecular basis although an absence of CAG repeat instability in 
      transgenic mice has so far been reported. These studies include (CAG) in the 
      androgen receptor cDNA, (CAG) in the HD cDNA, (CAG) in the SCA1 cDNA, (CAG) in 
      the SCA3 cDNA and as an isolated (CAG) tract.

TI  - Estimated contribution of known ataxia genes in ataxia patients undergoing DNA 
      testing.
PG  - 275-8
AB  - We estimated the relative contributions of known ataxia genes (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 
      and X25) in the patient population sent to our DNA diagnostic laboratory for 
      diagnostic testing. Approximately 28% of these patients had an abnormal triplet 
      repeat expansion in one of these ataxia genes (3% for SCA1, 8% for SCA2, 11% for 
      SCA3/MJD, 2% for SCA6, 3% for SCA7, and 1.5% for X25). The lack of abnormal 
      repeat expansions in the majority of ataxis patients tested suggests that the 
      molecular defects associated with most ataxia cases are currently undetermined 
      and that this population includes both familial and sporadic cases. In contrast, 
      of the patients submitted for genetic testing for Friedrich's ataxia (FRDA), 44% 
      (69/157) showed at least one expansion in the X25 gene, indicating that FRDA 
      accounts for a significant proportion of the recessively inherited ataxias and 
      appears to have a high rate of accurate clinical diagnosis. On the basis of our 
      DNA studies, we propose a comprehensive and efficient approach for molecular 
      analysis of ataxia patients.

TI  - The repeat expansion detection method in the analysis of diseases with CAG/CTG 
      repeat expansion: usefulness and limitations.
PG  - 486-8
AB  - The repeat expansion detection (RED) method was described to detect expansions of 
      trinucleotide repeats of unknown chromosomal location. We have improved the RED 
      method by the use of 8-mer oligonucleotides and assessed its usefulness in 30 
      samples from patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), Huntington's 
      disease (HD), and Machado Joseph's disease (MJD), for which the number of CAG/CTG 
      repeats was determined by sequencing. There was a good correlation between the 
      number of repeats detected by sequencing and those identified by RED. However, in 
      17% of samples, the RED gave additional fragments for ligation products of 
      different size than the CAG/CTG repeat expansion detected in the sample by 
      sequencing. The same was observed in a group of control subjects (n = 78) without 
      known clinical abnormalities in which products of more than 40 repeats were 
      detected in 27% of them, indicating that CAG/CTG repeat expansions are common in 
      the general population. Wether this corresponds to unidentified loci with 
      expansions deserves further investigation.

TI  - Peptides containing glutamine repeats as substrates for 
      transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking: relevance to diseases of the nervous 
      system.
PG  - 14580-5
AB  - Many proteins contain reiterated glutamine residues, but polyglutamine of 
      excessive length may result in human disease by conferring new properties on the 
      protein containing it. One established property of a glutamine residue, depending 
      on the nature of the flanking residues, is its ability to act as an amine 
      acceptor in a transglutaminase-catalyzed reaction and to make a glutamyl-lysine 
      cross-link with a neighboring polypeptide. To learn whether glutamine repeats can 
      act as amine acceptors, we have made peptides with variable lengths of 
      polyglutamine flanked by the adjacent amino acid residues in the proteins 
      associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), Machado-Joseph disease 
      (SCA3), or dentato-rubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) or those residues 
      adjacent to the preferred cross-linking site of involucrin, or solely by arginine 
      residues. The polyglutamine was found to confer excellent substrate properties on 
      any soluble peptide; under optimal conditions, virtually all the glutamine 
      residues acted as amine acceptors in the reaction with glycine ethyl-ester, and 
      lengthening the sequence of polyglutamine increased the reactivity of each 
      glutamine residue. In the presence of transglutaminase, peptides containing 
      polyglutamine formed insoluble aggregates with the proteins of brain extracts and 
      these aggregates contained glutamyl-lysine cross-links. Repeated glutamine 
      residues exposed on the surface of a neuronal protein should form cross-linked 
      aggregates in the presence of any transglutaminase activated by the presence of 
      Ca2+.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias in the Kinki area of Japan.
PG  - 399-406
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders characterized by slowly progressive cerebellar 
      ataxia. Recently, among the ataxias, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy have been 
      found to be caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the coding 
      region of the disease genes. We have analyzed the CAG repeats of 67 patients from 
      47 families with dominantly inherited ataxia who lived in the Kinki area of 
      Japan. The following results were obtained. First, 31 patients from 22 families 
      were found to be positive for the MJD repeat expansion, indicating that MJD is 
      the most common dominantly inherited ataxia in the Kinki area of Japan. Second, 
      no SCA1 repeat expansion was found among the families studied. This presents a 
      striking contrast to the fact that there are many families with SCA1 in Hokkaido 
      and the Tohoku area of Japan. These findings suggest geographic variation in 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias in Japan.

TI  - Screening for proteins with polyglutamine expansions in autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxias.
PG  - 1887-92
AB  - Expansion of trinucleotide CAG repeats coding for polyglutamine has been 
      implicated in five neurodegenerative disorders, including spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) 1 and SCA3 or Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), two forms of type I 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA). Using the 1C2 antibody which 
      specifically recognizes large polyglutamine tracts, particularly those that are 
      expanded, we recently reported the detection of proteins with pathological 
      glutamine expansions in lymphoblasts from another form of ADCA type I, SCA2, as 
      well as from patients presenting with the distinct phenotype of ADCA type II. We 
      now have screened a large series of patients with ADCA or isolated cases with 
      cerebellar ataxia, for the presence of proteins with polyglutamine expansions. A 
      150 kDa SCA2 protein was detected in 16 out of 40 families with ADCA type I. This 
      corresponds to 24% of all ADCA type I families, which is much more frequent than 
      SCA1 in this series of patients (13%). The signal intensity of the SCA2 protein 
      was negatively correlated to age at onset, as expected for an expanded and 
      unstable trinucleotide repeat mutation. The disease segregated with markers 
      closely linked to the SCA2 locus in all identified SCA2 families. In addition, a 
      specific 130 kDa protein, which segregated with the disease, was detected in 
      lymphoblasts of patients from nine families with ADCA type II. It was also 
      visualized in the cerebral cortex of one of the patients, demonstrating its 
      translation in the nervous system. Finally, no new disease-related proteins 
      containing expanded polyglutamine tracts could be detected in lymphoblasts from 
      the remaining patients with ADCA or isolated cases with cerebellar ataxia.

TI  - Relationship of (CAG)nC configuration to repeat instability of the Machado-Joseph 
      disease gene.
PG  - 643-5
AB  - The mutation responsible for Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) has been identified as 
      an expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in a novel gene on chromosome 14q32.1. 
      The CAG repeat tract is followed by C or G, and alleles are thereby divided into 
      two types on the basis of molecular configuration, (CAG)nC and (CAG)nG. We have 
      studied the relationship between the repeat length and the configuration in 38 
      patients from 28 Japanese families with MJD, and 31 unrelated normal Japanese 
      subjects. The CAG repeat length in 100 normal alleles ranged from 13 to 37 
      repeats, while 38 MJD patients had one expanded allele with 64 to 84 repeats. 
      Surprisingly, the expanded alleles had exclusively the (CAG)nC configuration, 
      while both (CAG)nC and (CAG)nG were seen in normal alleles from MJD and control 
      subjects. Furthermore, in normal alleles, the CAG repeat tract was significantly 
      longer in (CAG)nC than in (CAG)nG. These findings suggest that the (CAG)nC 
      configuration is related to repeat instability of the MJD gene.

TI  - Relations between genotype and phenotype in German patients with the 
      Machado-Joseph disease mutation.
PG  - 466-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia with extensive phenotypic variability originally described in families of 
      Portuguese ancestry. Recently, the mutation causing the disease has been 
      identified as an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat. In this study relations 
      between genotype and phenotype were investigated. METHODS: A series of 180 German 
      patients with degenerative forms of ataxia were clinically and genetically 
      examined. Patients bearing the MJD mutation were assigned to three phenotypes: 
      phenotype 1 characterised by early onset and dystonia or pronounced rigidity 
      associated with ataxia and spasticity. Main symptoms in phenotype 2 were ataxia 
      and spasticity. In phenotype 3 onset was relatively late and peripheral 
      neuropathy accompanied ataxia. Clinical and molecular data were correlated. 
      RESULTS: An expanded CAG array was found in 42 patients from 22 families. Repeat 
      length of CAG varied between 67 and 80 CAG motifs and showed an inverse 
      correlation with the age of onset. For the development of phenotype 1 early onset 
      (< 20 years) seemed more decisive than extensive repeat length. Phenotype 2 was 
      present in all patients with more than 73 CAG motifs and onset between 20 and 40. 
      Phenotype 3 developed in most patients with less than 73 CAG motifs and onset was 
      regularly beyond the age of 40. Intrafamilial variability of both repeat length 
      and phenotype was large reflecting meiotic instability of the expanded CAG 
      repeat. CONCLUSIONS: The MJD mutation is the most frequent cause of dominantly 
      inherited ataxia in Germany. Variations in repeat lengths substantially influence 
      age of onset as well as phenotype but cannot explain why MJD characteristics of 
      Portuguese families such as "bulging eyes", dystonia, and rigidity are 
      essentially missing in German families. Despite the genotypic and phenotypic 
      relations found in this study a reliable individual prognosis of the course of 
      the disease is not possible at a presymptomatic stage.

TI  - The relationship between trinucleotide repeat length and phenotypic variation in 
      Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 52-7
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansion in the Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) gene has been 
      found in 26 patients from 20 unrelated Japanese families. Expanded alleles had 68 
      to 84 repeats, whereas normal alleles had 14 to 37 repeats. The age of onset was 
      inversely correlated with the repeat length. To evaluate in detail the 
      relationship between the repeat length and clinical features, we subdivided the 
      26 patients into three groups on the basis of the repeat length (group 1, 78 
      repeats or more; group 2, 74 to 77 repeats; group 3, 73 repeats or less). Group 1 
      and group 2 had common features of spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, 
      bulging eyes, facial myokymia and extrapyramidal signs as well as cerebellar 
      ataxia and ophthalmoplegia. It should be noted that group 1 showed more prominent 
      pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs than group 2. In contrast, group 3 showed 
      hypotonia, hyporeflexia and sensory disturbance in addition to cerebellar ataxia 
      and ophthalmoplegia. These findings suggest that the repeat length plays an 
      important role in phenotypic variation. DNA analysis for the MJD mutation was 
      clearly useful for making an accurate diagnosis in patients without bulging eyes, 
      facial myokymia, dystonia or marked spasticity.

TI  - A familial factor independent of CAG repeat length influences age at onset of 
      Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 119-27
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is a late-onset, progressive, neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by the expansion of an unstable trinucleotide (CAG) repeat 
      sequence in a novel gene (MJD1) on chromosome 14. Previous studies showed that 
      age at onset is negatively correlated with the number of CAG repeat units, but 
      only part of the variation in onset age is explained by CAG repeat length. Ages 
      at onset and CAG repeat lengths of 136 MJD patients from 23 kindreds of 
      Portuguese descent were analyzed, to determine whether familial factors 
      independent of CAG repeat length modulate age at onset of MJD. Correlation among 
      sibs for onset age adjusted for CAG repeat length was .43, which indicates that 
      an environmental or genetic factor common to sibs influences onset age. Positive 
      correlations were also observed for avuncular (r = .22) and first-cousin pairs (r 
      = .28), which supports the hypothesis that a genetic factor is influencing age at 
      onset. Commingling analysis of onset ages adjusted for CAG repeat length 
      identified three distributions in this population of affected individuals. 
      Further studies of a much larger sample are needed to determine whether these 
      distributions represent the influence of a genetic or environmental factor.

TI  - Electrophysiological findings in a Danish family with Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 743-50
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with autosomal 
      dominant inheritance, We have carried out electrophysiological studies in 8 
      individuals belonging to a Danish family with several affected members. Five had 
      an expanded trinucleotide (CAG) repeat sequence in the MJD1 gene on chromosome 14 
      indicating MJD, while 3 unaffected individuals had normal repeat lengths. Three 
      individuals with repeat expansion had clinical symptoms and signs of the Machado 
      or "type III" phenotype, whereas 2 had slight symptoms and signs only, 
      Electrophysiological evaluation included visual, somatosensory, and auditory 
      brain stem evoked potentials, quantitative electromyography, and nerve conduction 
      studies. In the patients with clinical MJD, evoked potential studies showed 
      multimodal abnormalities, electromyography showed neurogenic changes, and nerve 
      conduction studies showed signs of severe loss of motor and sensory nerve fibers. 
      Of the 2 patients with slight symptoms and signs, 1 had evidence of peripheral 
      and central affection, while the other had slight signs of a central affection. 
      This study provides insight into the distribution and character of 
      electrophysiological abnormalities in MJD of putative importance for an 
      understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, and for monitoring disease 
      progress, or the outcome of a possible treatment.

TI  - Reevaluation of the exact CAG repeat length in hereditary cerebellar ataxias 
      using highly denaturing conditions and long PCR.
PG  - 591-5
AB  - Hereditary cerebellar ataxias, including spinocerebellar ataxia type I (SCA1), 
      dentato-rubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), 
      have been associated with unstable CAG repeats. The length of the CAG repeat is a 
      major factor in determining the age of onset of these diseases. In 
      electrophoresis through acrylamide gels with formamide, the CAG repeat length 
      following the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coincides with the 
      sequence-determined repeat length after subcloning. However, without formamide, 
      PCR products with long CAG repeats appear 1-4 repeats shorter than when 
      electrophoresed with formamide, and the repeat lengths are variable. In addition, 
      the larger the CAG repeats are, the more difficult are the PCR reactions. A 
      mixture containing thermostable Taq and Pwo DNA polymerases (so-called "long 
      PCR") is much more sensitive than that with Taq polymerase alone in detecting- 
      expanded CAG repeats. Therefore, highly denaturing conditions, especially 
      formamide gel electrophoresis, and the "long PCR" protocol should be used to 
      evaluate the exact CAG repeat length. We have used these principles to detect 
      unstable CAG repeats. The normal ranges are 14-34 repeats for MJD, 6-31 repeats 
      for DRPLA, and 21-32 repeats for SCA1.

TI  - Non-Mendelian transmission in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and 
      Machado-Joseph disease: the mutant allele is preferentially transmitted in male 
      meiosis.
PG  - 730-3
AB  - Autosomal dominant dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) are neurodegenerative disorders caused by CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions. An inverse correlation of age at onset with the 
      length of the expanded CAG trinucleotide repeats has been demonstrated, and the 
      intergenerational instability of the length of the CAG trinucleotide repeats, 
      which is more prominent in paternal than in maternal transmissions, has been 
      shown to underlie the basic mechanisms of anticipation in DRPLA and MJD. Our 
      previous observations on DRPLA and MJD pedigrees, as well as a review of the 
      literature, have suggested that the numbers of affected offspring exceed those of 
      unaffected offspring, which is difficult to explain by the Mendelian principle of 
      random segregation of alleles. In the present study, we analyzed the segregation 
      patterns in 211 transmissions in 24 DRPLA pedigrees and 80 transmissions in 7 MJD 
      pedigrees, with the diagnoses confirmed by molecular testing. Significant 
      distortions in favor of transmission of the mutant alleles were found in male 
      meiosis, where the mutant alleles were transmitted to 62% of all offspring in 
      DRPLA (chi2 = 7.69; P<.01) and 73% in MJD (chi2 = 6.82; P<.01). The results were 
      consistent with meiotic drive in DRPLA and MJD. Since more prominent meiotic 
      instability of the length of the CAG trinucleotide repeats is observed in male 
      meiosis than in female meiosis and meiotic drive is observed only in male 
      meiosis, these results raise the possibility that a common molecular mechanism 
      underlies the meiotic drive and the meiotic instability in male meiosis.

TI  - Analysis of CAG trinucleotide expansion associated with Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 101-7
AB  - There are currently some types of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias such as 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), spinocerebellar ataxia types 1-5 (SCA1-5), or 
      hereditary dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy. It is very important for these 
      ataxias to be clinically differentiated, but that is sometimes difficult. In 
      particular, the differential diagnosis between MJD and SCA1 is thought to be the 
      most difficult. Recently, both MJD and SCA1 have been proven to be related to 
      expansions of CAG trinucleotide in their causative genes. In this study, 20 cases 
      of MJD in 13 unrelated Japanese families were genetically and clinically examined 
      in comparison with 20 cases of age at onset- and duration-matched Japanese SCA1. 
      The CAG repeat number of expanded MJD and SCA1 alleles was 72.2 +/- 3.1 (mean +/- 
      SD, n = 20) and 47.3 +/- 4.4 (n = 20), respectively, and each repeat size was 
      inversely correlated with age at onset in both MJD and SCA1. The repeat number in 
      leukocytes increased from parents to children with acceleration of age at onset 
      (anticipation) in MJD. In MJD, the number of CAG repeats in the expanded allele 
      was lower in sperm than that of leukocytes, but was more in SCA1. However, the 
      number of peaks in the expanded allele was greater in sperm than in leukocytes in 
      both MJD and SCA1 (increased mosaicism level). MJD was clinically characterized 
      by a relatively higher frequency of ocular signs such as eyelid retraction, 
      bulging eyes, ophthalmoparesis, and nystagmus, spasticity in lower limbs, and 
      sensory and urinary disturbances in contrast to the SCA1 patients except for slow 
      eye movement. These results indicate that the expanded CAG repeat and clinical 
      features are correlated in both MJD and SCA1, and MJD can be differentiated from 
      SCA1 by clinical characteristics mentioned above as well as DNA analysis.

TI  - Analysis of CAG repeat of the Machado-Joseph gene in human, chimpanzee and monkey 
      populations: a variant nucleotide is associated with the number of CAG repeats.
PG  - 207-13
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      associated with an unstable and expanded CAG repeat. We analyzed this locus from 
      various sources including MJD families, Acadian, African American, Caucasian, 
      Greenland Inuit and Thai populations. The range of the CAG repeat size was 14-40 
      in the normal alleles while the MJD alleles contained 73-78 repeats in our 
      studies. We found 25 different alleles on normal chromosomes with a 
      heterozygosity of 0.86 in combined populations. The most common alleles were 23 
      (22.9%) and 14 (25.5%) repeats. We also examined 16 chimpanzees and various Old 
      World monkeys: a pigtail macaque, a mangabey and 12 rhesus macaques. The DNA 
      sequences surrounding the CAG repeat did not vary among species. The range of the 
      number of the CAG repeats is 13-14 in macaques, 16 in mangabey and 14-20 in 
      chimpanzees. Variant CAA or AAG triplets in the CAG repeat tracts were found in 
      all 268 human, 28 monkey and 32 chimpanzee chromosomes. As reported in a previous 
      study [Kawaguchi et al. (1994) Nature Genet. 8, 221-228] the common variant 
      positions were the third (CAA), fourth (AAG) and sixth (CAA) positions. However, 
      we found three human chromosomes containing CAG at the sixth position and the 
      mangabey had AAG at the ninth position. In addition, we found CAG at the fourth 
      position and AAG at the sixth position in all macaque chromosomes. The nucleotide 
      following the CAG repeat tract was usually G in all species studied. However, we 
      sometimes found C at this position in human and chimpanzee chromosomes. 
      Interestingly, this variant C was found in all expanded chromosomes and in 54.5% 
      of chromosomes with 27-40 CAG repeats but it was not found in any chromosomes 
      with less than 20 CAG repeats. We hypothesize that the variant C may be 
      associated with CAG repeat instability.

      disease, and X-linked recessive spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 43-50
AB  - We investigated the somatic mosaicism of trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 
      neural and nonneural tissues of a dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) 
      patient and their correlation to the topographical distribution of the 
      pathological involvement. The spatial pattern of tissue-specific somatic 
      mosaicism in the CAG repeat size was significantly different among the DRPLA, MJD 
      and SBMA patients. The size of the major bands of the mutant CAG repeat allele 
      was significantly smaller in the cerebellar cortex in both DRPLA and MJD patients 
      by 6 and 2 repeat units respectively and larger in the colon and liver of DRPLA 
      by 5 repeats or more. There were also 1-2 repeat-sized small variations of major 
      band size among the neural tissues in DRPLA. In contrast, there was no 
      tissue-specific variation of major bands of CAG repeats and diversity of extra 
      bands among the examined tissues including the cerebellum in the SBMA patient. 
      There was no parallel occurrence of tissue-specific CAG instability and severity 
      of neuropathological involvement in the neural and nonneural tissues of DRPLA, 
      MJD and SBMA patients. Lack of significant tissue-specific somatic mosaicism in 
      SBMA including the cerebellar cortex may suggest that CAG repeat expansion in the 
      mutant androgen receptor gene is far more stable compared with that in DRPLA and 
      MJD as well as those reported in Huntington's disease.

TI  - Mutation detection in Machado-Joseph disease using repeat expansion detection.
PG  - 77-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several neurological disorders have recently been explained through 
      the discovery of expanded DNA repeat sequences. Among these is Machado-Joseph 
      disease, one of the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (MJD/SCA3), caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion on chromosome 14. A useful way of detecting repeat sequence 
      mutations is offered by the repeat expansion detection method (RED), in which a 
      thermostable ligase is used to detect repeat expansions directly from genomic 
      DNA. We have used RED to detect CAG expansions in families with either MJD/SCA3 
      or with previously uncharacterized spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Five MJD/SCA3 families and one SCA family where linkage to SCA1-5 had 
      been excluded were analyzed by RED and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: 
      An expansion represented by RED products of 180-270 bp segregated with MJD/SCA3 
      (p < 0.00001) in five families (n = 60) and PCR products corresponding to 66-80 
      repeat copies were observed in all affected individuals. We also detected a 
      210-bp RED product segregating with disease (p < 0.01) in a non-SCA1-5 family (n 
      = 16), suggesting involvement of a CAG expansion in the pathophysiology. PCR 
      analysis subsequently revealed an elongated MJD/SCA3 allele in all affected 
      family members. CONCLUSIONS: RED products detected in Machado-Joseph disease 
      families correlated with elongated PCR products at the MJD/SCA3 locus. We 
      demonstrate the added usefulness of RED in detecting repeat expansions in 
      disorders where linkage is complicated by phenotyping problems in gradually 
      developing adult-onset disorders, as in the non-SCA1-5 family examined. The RED 
      method is informative without any knowledge of flanking sequences. This is 
      particularly useful when studying diseases where the mutated gene is unknown. We 
      conclude that RED is a reliable method for analyzing expanded repeat sequences in 
      the genome.

TI  - Machado-Joseph disease: correlation between the clinical features, the CAG repeat 
      length and homozygosity for the mutation.
PG  - 3-7
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      associated with the expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat in the MJD1 gene 
      located on 14q32.1. We confirmed that the CAG expansion caused MJD in a Yemenite 
      Jewish family and demonstrated that most of the clinical variation among members 
      of this family was due to the genotype of the affected individuals. Six patients 
      who presented with an early onset (25 years) and severe disorder were found to be 
      homozygous for the CAG expansion. Among 5 heterozygotes for the CAG expansion 
      older than 40 years, one had neurological symptoms from the age of 45, while the 
      others were asymptomatic. In one of the heterozygotes, no neurological symptoms 
      were present when last examined at the age of 66. Homozygosity for the MJD1 
      mutation was the main cause of variability in this large family, however, other 
      factors clearly played a role in the expression of the gene. We could demonstrate 
      that homozygote sibs with similar expansion in both alleles had significant 
      differences in disease severity. Gender did not affect the clinical expression in 
      this family.

TI  - Frequency of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy, 
      and Machado-Joseph disease mutations in a large group of spinocerebellar ataxia 
      patients.
PG  - 214-8
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders varying in both clinical manifestations and mode of inheritance. Six 
      different genes causing autosomal dominant SCA are mapped: SCA1, SCA2, 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA4, SCA5, and dentatorubropallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA). Expansions of an unstable trinucleotide CAG repeat cause three 
      of these disorders: SCA type 1 (SCA1), MJD, and DRPLA. We determine the frequency 
      of the SCA1, DRPLA, and MJD mutations in a large group of unrelated SCA patients 
      with various patterns of inheritance and different ethnic backgrounds. We studied 
      92 unrelated SCA patients. The frequency of the SCA1 mutation was 3% in the 
      overall patient group and 10% in the non-Portuguese dominantly inherited SCA 
      subgroup. We found that DRPLA mutation in only one Japanese patient, who was 
      previously diagnosed with this disease. We identified the MJD mutation in 41% of 
      the overall patient group, which included 38 autosomal dominant kindreds of 
      Portuguese origin; the frequency of the MJD mutation among the non-Portuguese 
      dominantly inherited cases was 17%. These results suggest that SCA may be 
      occasionally caused by the SCA1 mutation and rarely caused by the DRPLA mutation 
      and that, to date, the MJD mutation seems to be the most common cause of 
      dominantly inherited SCA. Finally, our results suggest that recessively inherited 
      cases of SCA are not caused by the known trinucleotide repeat expansions.

TI  - Mutations in American families with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 3: SCA3 is 
      allelic to Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 208-13
AB  - We identified an expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the coding region 
      of the Machado-Joseph disease gene in 7 of 24 American families diagnosed with 
      autosomal dominant ataxia. All affected individuals were heterozygous for an 
      expanded allele that ranged from 67 to more than 200 CAG repeats, whereas the 
      normal allele had 14 to 33 repeats. In contrast to the Azorean-Portuguese origins 
      of Machado-Joseph disease, the two largest American families were of German and 
      Dutch-African descent. Clinical, pathologic, and genetic evaluations suggest that 
      American families with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 differ from those with 
      Machado-Joseph disease by their ethnic origins, predominant spinopontine atrophy, 
      lack of dystonic features, and larger CAG repeat expansion.

      repeat instability for parental transmission, and correlation with disease 
      phenotype.
PG  - 128-33
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is caused by abnormal expansion of an unstable CAG 
      repeat in a novel gene locating on chromosome 14q32.1. We analysed this CAG 
      repeat polymorphism with 66 Japanese MJD patients. All the patients were 
      selectively associated with abnormal expansion of the CAG repeat. Repeat length 
      of the mutant allele did not overlap that of normal allele and closely correlated 
      with not only age at onset but also with clinical phenotypes. CAG repeat size is 
      apparently related to a wide variety of phenotypic presentations in MJD.

PG  - 684-7
AB  - The subtype IV of Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), characterized by parkinsonism 
      variably combined with ataxia, distal atrophy, and sensory loss, has been all but 
      ignored in recent reports of MJD, including those describing the molecular 
      biologic substrate of the disease. We have demonstrated expansion of the CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat of the MJD1 gene located on chromosome 14q32.1 in 2 patients 
      of Azorean descent who presented with levodopa-responsive atypical parkinsonism. 
      Previous publications have documented the presence of this expanded repeat in the 
      other more common MJD phenotypes (I-III). To our knowledge, this is the first 
      molecular biologic confirmation of the presence of the MJD1 gene in the subtype 
      IV phenotype. Patients presenting with parkinsonism and peripheral neuropathy 
      should be screened for this genetic defect.

TI  - Marked phenotypic heterogeneity associated with expansion of a CAG repeat 
      sequence at the spinocerebellar ataxia 3/Machado-Joseph disease locus.
PG  - 809-16
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxia 3 locus (SCA3) for type I autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia (ADCA type I), a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group 
      of neurodegenerative disorders, has been mapped to chromosome 14q32.1. ADCA type 
      I patients from families segregating SCA3 share clinical features in common with 
      those with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), the gene of which maps to the same 
      region. We show here that the disease gene segregating in each of three French 
      ADCA type I kindreds and in a French family with neuropathological findings 
      suggesting the ataxochoreic form of dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy carries an 
      expanded CAG repeat sequence located at the same locus as that for MJD. Analysis 
      of the mutation in these families shows a strong negative correlation between 
      size of the expanded CAG repeat and age at onset of clinical disease. Instability 
      of the expanded triplet repeat was not found to be affected by sex of the parent 
      transmitting the mutation. Evidence was found for somatic and gonadal mosaicism 
      for alleles carrying expanded trinucleotide repeats.

TI  - Detection of the Machado-Joseph disease/spinocerebellar ataxia three 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in families with autosomal dominant motor 
      disorders, including the Drew family of Walworth.
PG  - 1077-85
AB  - Affected members of 63 families with a variety of autosomal dominant late onset 
      cerebellar ataxias (ADCA), and 29 patients with similar phenotypes but no 
      affected relatives, were investigated for the trinucleotide (CAG) repeat 
      expansion described in Japanese families with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). This 
      disorder had previously been shown to map to the region of chromosome 14 which 
      also contains a locus causing ADCA in French families, spinocerebellar ataxia 3 
      (SCA3). The MJD/SCA3 mutation was identified in nine families with ADCA type I, 
      and a further family in which affected members had parkinsonism, peripheral 
      neuropathy, dystonia, and spasticity, but little evidence of cerebellar disease. 
      Only one of the 10 families was British (the Drew family of Walworth); the others 
      originated from India, Jamaica, Ghana, Brazil and France. There was no single 
      clinical feature which distinguished patients with the MJD/SCA3 mutation from 
      those with the CAG expansion on chromosome 6 (SCA1) or ADCA type I families with 
      no known mutation. The CAG repeat length ranged from 13-41 copies on normal 
      chromosomes and 62-80 copies on affected chromosomes. There was a significant 
      inverse correlation between age of onset of symptoms and repeat length, but no 
      significant effect of parental sex on repeat length or age of onset in offspring. 
      DNA analysis for the MJD/SCA3 mutation is useful for diagnosis in patients with 
      familial ataxic or extrapyramidal syndromes, and will aid genetic counselling in 
      these disorders.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia, type 3 (SCA3) is genetically identical to Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD).
PG  - 71-5
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia, type 3 (SCA3) and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) are two 
      clinically distinct representatives of the heterogeneous group of autosomal 
      dominant cerebellar ataxias. Assignment of the disease genes to the same region 
      of the long arm of chromosome 14 in both SCA3 and MJD suggested that these two 
      disorders are genetically identical. The recent identification of a trinucleotide 
      (CAG) repeat expansion in a gene underlying MJD facilitates assessment of this 
      hypothesis. We analysed the MJD gene in members of a family with characteristic 
      features of SCA3 and no symptoms typical of MJD. We found the same trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion within the gene that was previously described in patients with 
      MJD. The findings demonstrate that SCA3 and MJD are genetically identical in 
      spite of their pronounced clinical differences. Furthermore, we demonstrate a 
      striking variation in the copy number of the CAG repeat among affected members of 
      the same family.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 and Machado-Joseph disease: incidence of CAG 
      expansions among adult-onset ataxia patients from 311 families with dominant, 
      recessive, or sporadic ataxia.
PG  - 603-8
AB  - The ataxias are a complex group of diseases with both environmental and genetic 
      causes. Among the autosomal dominant forms of ataxia the genes for two, 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), have been 
      isolated. In both of these disorders the molecular basis of disease is the 
      expansion of an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat. To assess the frequency of the 
      SCA1 and MJD trinucleotide repeat expansions among individuals diagnosed with 
      ataxia we have collected DNA from individuals representing 311 families with 
      adult-onset ataxia of unknown etiology and screened these samples for 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions within the SCA1 and MJD genes. Within this group 
      there are 149 families with dominantly inherited ataxia. Of these, 3% had SCA1 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions, whereas 21% were positive for the MJD 
      trinucleotide expansion. Thus, together SCA1 and MJD represent 24% of the 
      autosomal dominant ataxias in our group, and the frequency of MJD is 
      substantially greater than that of SCA1. For the 57 patients with MJD 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions, a strong inverse correlation between CAG repeat 
      size and age at onset was observed (r = -.838). Among the MJD patients, the 
      normal and affected ranges of CAG repeat size are 14-40 and 68-82 repeats, 
      respectively. For SCA1 the normal and affected ranges are much closer, containing 
      19-38 and 40-81 CAG repeats, respectively.

TI  - Correlation between CAG repeat length and clinical features in Machado-Joseph 
      disease.
PG  - 54-61
AB  - Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is associated with the expansion of a CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat in a novel gene on 14q32.1. We confirmed the presence of 
      this expansion in 156 MJD patients from 33 families of different geographic 
      origins: 15 Portuguese Azorean, 2 Brazilian, and 16 North American of Portuguese 
      Azorean descent. Normal chromosomes contain between 12 and 37 CAG repeats in the 
      MJD gene, whereas MJD gene carriers have alleles within the expanded range of 
      62-84 CAG units. The distribution of expanded alleles and the gap between normal 
      and expanded allele sizes is either inconsistent with a premutation hypothesis or 
      most (if not all) of the alleles we studied descend from a common ancestor. There 
      is a strong correlation between the expanded repeat size and the age at onset of 
      the disease as well as the clinical presentation. There is mild instability of 
      the CAG tract length with transmission of the expanded alleles; both increase and 
      decrease in size between parents and progeny occur, with larger variations in 
      male than in female transmissions. Together, these effects can partly explain the 
      variability of age at onset and of phenotypic features in MJD; however, other 
      modifying factors must exist.

TI  - Familial periodic cerebellar ataxia without myokymia maps to a 19-cM region on 
      19p13.
PG  - 1443-9
AB  - Familial periodic cerebellar ataxia (FPCA) is a heterogeneous group of rare 
      autosomal dominant disorders characterized by episodic cerebellar disturbance. A 
      potassium-channel gene (KCNA1) has been found to be responsible for one of its 
      subgroups, familial periodic cerebellar ataxia with myokymia (FPCA/+M; MIM 
      160120). A different subgroup that is not associated with myokymia (FPCA/-M; MIM 
      108500) was recently mapped to chromosome 19p. Here we have performed linkage 
      analysis in two large families with FPCA/-M that also demonstrated 
      neurodegenerative pathology of the cerebellum. Three markers in 19p13 gave 
      significant lod scores (> 3.0), while linkage to KCNA1 and three known loci for 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3) was excluded. The highest lod score 
      was obtained with the marker D19S413 (4.4 at recombination fraction 0), and 
      identification of meiotic recombinants in affected individuals placed the locus 
      between the flanking markers D19S406 and D19S226, narrowing the interval to 19 
      cM. A CAG trinucleotide-repeat expansion was detected in one family but did not 
      cosegregate with the disease.

TI  - Trinucleotide expansion within the MJD1 gene presents clinically as 
      spinocerebellar ataxia and occurs most frequently in German SCA patients.
PG  - 1001-5
AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder which leads to progressive cerebellar 
      ataxia. A gene responsible for SCA type 3 has been mapped to human chromosome 
      14q, close to the Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) locus. The MJD1 gene has recently 
      been cloned and the disease causing mutation has been identified as an unstable 
      and expanded (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat. As some clinical features of MJD 
      overlap with those of SCA we investigated the MJD mutation in 38 German families 
      with dominantly inherited SCA. The MJD1 (CAG)n expansion was identified in 19 
      families. In contrast, the trinucleotide expansion was not observed in 21 ataxia 
      patients without family history of the disease. Analysis of the (CAG)n repeat 
      length in 30 patients revealed an inverse correlation with the age of onset. The 
      (CAG)n stretch of the affected allele varied between 67 and 78 trinucleotide 
      units, the normal alleles carried between 12 and 28 simple repeats. These results 
      demonstrate that the MJD mutation causes the disease phenotype of most SCA 
      patients in Germany.

TI  - Molecular features of the CAG repeats and clinical manifestation of 
      Machado-Joseph disease.
PG  - 807-12
AB  - Machado--Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      degeneration mapped to chromosome 14q32.1. The CAG expansions of the MJD1 gene 
      was identified as the cause of the disease. We have analyzed 90 MJD individuals 
      from 62 independent MJD families and found that the MJD1 repeat length is 
      inversely correlated with the age of onset (r = -0.87). The MJD chromosomes 
      contained 61-84 repeat units, whereas normal chromosomes displayed 14-34 repeats. 
      In the normal chromosomes, 14 repeat units were the most common and the shortest. 
      In association with the clinical anticipation of the disease, a parent--child 
      analysis showed the unidirectional expansion of CAG repeats and no case of 
      diminution in the affected family. The differences in CAG repeat length between 
      parent and child and between siblings are greater in paternal transmission than 
      in maternal transmission. Detailed analysis revealed that a large degree of 
      expansion was associated with a shorter length of MJD1 gene in paternal 
      transmission. On the other hand, the increments of increase were similar for 
      shorter and longer expansion in maternal transmission. Among the three clinical 
      subtypes, type I of MJD, with dystonia, showed a larger degree of expansion in 
      CAG repeats of the gene and younger ages of onset than the other types.

TI  - CAG expansions in a novel gene for Machado-Joseph disease at chromosome 14q32.1.
PG  - 221-8
AB  - We have identified a novel gene containing CAG repeats and mapped it to 
      chromosome 14q32.1, the genetic locus for Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). In normal 
      individuals the gene contains between 13 and 36 CAG repeats, whereas most of the 
      clinically diagnosed patients and all of the affected members of a family with 
      the clinical and pathological diagnosis of MJD show expansion of the 
      repeat-number (from 68-79). Southern blot analyses and genomic cloning 
      demonstrates the existence of related genes. These results raise the possibility 
      that similar abnormalities in related genes may give rise to diseases similar to 
      MJD.
