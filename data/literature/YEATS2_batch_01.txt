AB  - BACKGROUND: Familial adult myoclonic epilepsy (FAME), an autosomal dominant 
      disorder, is characterized by cortical myoclonus and occasional generalized 
      tonic-clonic seizures. To date, intronic pentanucleotide repeat expansions in at 
      least seven genes, including SAMD12, TNRC6A, YEATS2, MARCHF6, STARD7, RAPGEF2, 
      and RAI1, have been reported as causative. Detecting these repeat expansions 
      using conventional sequencing techniques (Sanger or short-read next-generation 
      sequencing) is not feasible as they cannot reliably span or characterize long 
      repetitive elements. Although genetic testing has been performed in some research 
      laboratories, comprehensive long read-based panel is unavailable for clinical 
      application. To address this gap, we developed a targeted long-read sequencing 
      panel and applied it in a clinical diagnostic context for the first time. 
      METHODS: We designed a custom long-read sequencing panel targeting all seven 
      known FAME-associated repeat loci using Oxford Nanopore Cas9-enrichment 
      technology and applied it to a 47-year-old woman with familial cortical myoclonic 
      tremor, clinically suspected to have FAME. RESULTS: The panel functioned as 
      intended, providing robust on-target coverage across all loci, facilitating 
      confident interrogation of each repeat region. At the SAMD12 locus, strand-aware 
      histograms and read-level inspection demonstrated a clear pathogenic expansion, 
      encompassing mixed TTTTA/TTTCA motifs with detectable TTTGA interruptions, 
      consistent with FAME1. Using the crude allele prediction option of 
      tandem-genotypes, the expanded allele contained approximately 689 additional 
      repeats relative to the reference genome. The other six loci showed no pathogenic 
      expansions. CONCLUSIONS: This targeted long-read panel enabled the first clinical 
      molecular diagnosis of FAME using a comprehensive assay, yielding allele-resolved 
      characterization of the pathogenic repeat and its motif composition. With further 
      validation, this approach may serve as a clinically practical tool for reliable 
      detection of FAME1 and for broader screening of other FAME subtypes, potentially 
      reducing reliance on prolonged clinical observation or specialized 
      electrophysiological testing.

TI  - FAME4-associating YEATS2 knockdown impairs dopaminergic synaptic integrity and 
      leads to seizure-like behaviours in Drosophila melanogaster.

AB  - Familial adult myoclonus epilepsy (FAME) is a neurological disorder caused by a 
      TTTTA/TTTCA intronic repeat expansion. FAME4 is one of the six types of FAME that 
      results from the repeat expansion in the first intron of the gene YEATS2. 
      Although the RNA toxicity is believed to be the primary mechanism underlying 
      FAME, the role of genes where repeat expansions reside is still unclear, 
      particularly in the case of YEATS2 in neurons. This study used Drosophila to 
      explore the effects of reducing YEATS2 expression. Two pan-neuronally driven 
      dsDNA were used for knockdown of Drosophila YEATS2 (dYEATS2), and the resulting 
      molecular and behavioural outcomes were evaluated. Drosophila with reduced 
      dYEATS2 expression exhibited decreased tolerance to acute stress, disturbed 
      locomotion, abnormal social behaviour, and decreased motivated activity. 
      Additionally, reducing dYEATS2 expression negatively affected tyrosine 
      hydroxylase (TH) gene expression, resulting in decreased dopamine biosynthesis. 
      Remarkably, seizure-like behaviours induced by knocking down dYEATS2 were rescued 
      by the administration of L-DOPA. This study reveals a novel role of YEATS2 in 
      neurons in regulating acute stress responses, locomotion, and complex behaviours, 
      and suggests that haploinsufficiency of YEATS2 may play a role in FAME4.

TI  - TTTCA repeat insertions in an intron of YEATS2 in benign adult familial myoclonic 
      epilepsy type 4.

AB  - Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder and identification of its causes is 
      important for a better understanding of its pathogenesis. We previously studied a 
      Thai family with a type of epilepsy, benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy 
      type 4 (BAFME4), and localized its gene to chromosome 3q26.32-q28. Here, we used 
      single-molecule real-time sequencing and found expansions of TTTTA and insertions 
      of TTTCA repeats in intron 1 of YEATS2 in one affected member of the family. Of 
      all the available members in the family-comprising 13 affected and eight 
      unaffected-repeat-primed PCR and long-range PCR revealed the co-segregation of 
      the TTTCA repeat insertions with the TTTTA repeat expansions and the disease 
      status. For 1116 Thai control subjects, none were found to harbour the TTTCA 
      repeats while four had the TTTTA repeat expansions. Therefore, our findings 
      suggest that BAFME4 is caused by the insertions of the intronic TTTCA repeats in 
      YEATS2. Interestingly, all four types of BAFMEs for which underlying genes have 
      been found (BAFMEs 1, 4, 6 and 7) are caused by the same molecular pathology, 
      suggesting that the insertions of non-coding TTTCA repeats are involved in their 
      pathogenesis.
