TI  - IRF2BPL-Related Disorder, Causing Neurodevelopmental Disorder with Regression, 
      Abnormal Movements, Loss of Speech and Seizures (NEDAMSS) Is Characterized by 
      Pathology Consistent with DRPLA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood neurodegenerative diseases often pose a challenge to 
      clinicians to diagnose because of the degree of genetic heterogeneity and 
      variable presentations. Here, we present a child with progressive 
      neurodegeneration consisting of spasticity, dystonia, and ataxia in which 
      postmortem pathological analysis led to the diagnosis of interferon regulatory 
      factor 2 binding protein like (IRF2BPL)-related disorder. METHODS: Detailed 
      postmortem gross and histological examination was conducted, and findings 
      consistent with dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and included 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) inclusions. Follow up testing for the CAG repeat expansion 
      at ATN1 was non-diagnostic. RESULTS: Subsequent exome sequencing reanalysis of 
      the research exome identified a pathogenic de novo IRF2BPL variant. The IRF2BPL 
      c.562C>T, p.(Arg188Ter) variant, distal to the polyQ repeat tract, results in 
      variable mRNA levels depending on the cell type examined with decreased mRNA in 
      the brain, as well as destabilization of the protein product and corresponding 
      downstream molecular abnormalities in patient derived cells. CONCLUSION: We 
      provide the first detailed pathological description for IRF2BPL-related disorder, 
      termed NEDAMSS (neurodevelopmental disorder with regression, abnormal movements, 
      loss of speech and seizures; Mendelian Inheritance in Man, 618088) and evidence 
      for the inclusion of this condition in the differential diagnosis of 
      spastic-ataxic neurodegenerative conditions, reminiscent of DRPLA. Although the 
      individuals with NEDAMSS do not carry an expansion, the polyQ repeat tract may 
      play a role in the pathological inclusions that would represent a novel disease 
      mechanism for polyQ repeats. (c) 2024 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder

AB  - There is an obvious clinical-pathological overlap between essential tremor and 
      some known tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansion disorders. The aim is 
      to analyse whether these short tandem repeat genes, including ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, TBP, BEAN1, NOP56, DAB1, ATN1, 
      SADM12 and FMR1, are associated with familial essential tremor patients. Genetic 
      analysis of repeat sizes in tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansions was 
      performed in a large cohort of 515 familial essential tremor probands and 300 
      controls. The demographic and clinical features among carriers of pathogenic 
      expansions, intermediate repeats and non-carriers were compared. A total of 18 
      out of 515 (18/515, 3.7%) patients were found to have repeats expansions, 
      including 12 cases (12/515, 2.5%) with intermediate repeat expansions (one ATXN1, 
      eight TBP, two FMR1, one ATN1), and six cases (6/515, 1.2%) with pathogenic 
      expansions (one ATXN1, one ATXN2, one ATXN8OS, one PPP2R2B, one FMR1, one 
      SAMD12). There were no statistically significant differences in intermediate 
      repeats compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, there were no significant 
      differences in demographics and clinical features among individuals with 
      pathogenic expansions, intermediate repeat expansions carriers and non-carriers. 
      Our study indicates that the intermediate repeat expansion in tremor-associated 
      short tandem repeat expansions does not pose an increased risk for essential 
      tremor, and rare pathogenic expansion carriers have been found in the familial 
      essential tremor cohort. The diagnosis of essential tremor based solely on 
      clinical symptoms remains a challenge in distinguishing it from known short 
      tandem repeat expansions diseases with overlapping clinical-pathological 
      features.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) is a neurological disease characterized by 
      action tremor in upper arms. Although its high heritability and prevalence 
      worldwide, its etiology and association with other diseases are still unknown. 
      METHOD: We investigated 10 common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), including SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, SCA36, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA) in 92 early-onset familial ET pedigrees in China collected from 
      2016 to 2022. RESULT: We found one SCA12 proband carried 51 CAG repeats within 
      PPP2R2B gene and one SCA3 proband with intermediate CAG repeats (55) with ATXN3 
      gene. The other 90 ET probands all had normal repeat expansions. CONCLUSION: 
      Tremor can be the initial phenotype of certain SCA. For early-onset, familial ET 
      patients, careful physical examinations are needed before genetic SCA screening.

AB  - Neurologists have a difficult time identifying sporadic cerebellar ataxia. 
      Multiple system atrophy of the cerebellar type (MSA-C), spontaneous late cortical 
      cerebellar atrophy, and prolonged alcohol use are a few possible causes. In a 
      group of people with sporadic cerebellar ataxia that was not MSA-C, an 
      autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) mutation was recently discovered. 
      Chinese single-hospital cohort will be used in this study to genetic screen for 
      SCA-related genes. One hundred forty individuals with CA were monitored over 8 
      years. Thirty-one individuals had familial CA, 109 patients had sporadic CA, 73 
      had MSA-C, and 36 had non-MSA-C sporadic CA. In 28 of the 31 non-MSA-C sporadic 
      patients who requested the test, we carried out gene analysis, including SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, SCA31, and 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The control group consisted of 
      family members of the patients. In 57% of the instances with spontaneous CA that 
      were not MSA-C, gene abnormalities were discovered. The most frequent exception 
      among individuals with sporadic CA was SCA6 (36%), followed by monsters in SCA1, 
      2, 3, 8, and DRPLA. In contrast, 75% of the patients with familial CA had gene 
      abnormalities, the most frequent of which was SCA6 abnormality. The age of 69 vs 
      59 was higher, and the CAG repeat length was a minor age of 23 vs 25 in the 
      former instances compared to the last one among individuals with SCA6 anomalies 
      that were sporadic as opposed to familial cases. In sporadic CA, 
      autosomal-dominant mutations in SCA genes, notably in SCA6, are common. Although 
      the cause of the increased incidence of SCA6 mutations is unknown, it may be 
      related to a greater age of onset and varied penetrance of SCA6 mutations.

TI  - The relationship between the number of CAG repeats and clinical manifestations: a 
      survey of Chinese DRPLA family.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical, radiological, and genetic characteristics of 
      a Chinese family with dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). Explore the 
      distribution of CAG repeat size to the clinical features of patients. METHODS: We 
      collected the clinical symptoms and DNA analysis for the DRPLA gene was performed 
      on the family members. DRPLA patients reported in the literature were reviewed to 
      analyze the association between CAG repeat size and clinical features. RESULTS: 
      Six family members were confirmed by genetic analysis. The number of CAG repeat 
      in the proband, her sister, her grandmother, her father, her uncle, and her 
      cousin, was determined respectively as 63, 75, 50, 50, 50, 54. In our family, the 
      sister of the proband had the earliest onset age and the most severe clinical 
      symptoms, followed by the proband, and other family members showed no obvious 
      clinical symptoms. Consistent with the conclusion of previous studies, the more 
      repeats CAG, the earlier the age of onset and the severer phenotypes are. 
      CONCLUSION: We found six family members have CAG repeat expansion in the DRPLA 
      gene on chromosome 12p13. Even in the same family, patients have different 
      clinical presentations. The size of CAG repeats is negatively correlated with the 
      age of onset and positively correlated with symptom severity. When the number of 
      repeats is >/= 63, the age at onset is < 21 years old, and obvious clinical 
      symptoms generally appear. It seems to say the more repeats CAG, the earlier the 
      age of onset and the severer phenotypes are. LIMITATIONS: With a small number of 
      cases in our family, the conclusion that the more CAG repeats, the earlier the 
      onset and the more severe the clinical symptoms cannot be fully proved.

TI  - Fast and reliable detection of repeat expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia using 
      exomes.
PG  - 717-721

AB  - Usually, molecular diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia is based on a step-by-step 
      approach with targeted sizing of four repeat expansions accounting for most 
      dominant cases, then targeted sequencing of other genes. Nowadays, genome 
      sequencing allows detection of most pathogenic variants in a single step. The 
      ExpansionHunter tool can detect expansions in short-read genome sequencing data. 
      Recent studies have shown that ExpansionHunter can also be used to identify 
      repeat expansions in exome sequencing data. We tested ExpansionHunter on 
      spinocerebellar ataxia exomes in a research context as a second-line analysis, 
      after exclusion of main CAG repeat expansions in half of the probands. First, we 
      confirmed the detection of expansions in seven known expansion carriers and then, 
      after targeted analysis of ATXN1, 2, 3 and 7, CACNA1A, TBP, ATN1, NOP56, AR and 
      HTT in 498 exomes, we found 22 additional pathogenic expansions. Comparison with 
      capillary migration sizing in 247 individuals and confirmation of all expanded 
      alleles detected by ExpansionHunter demonstrated that for these loci, sensitivity 
      and specificity reached 100%. ExpansionHunter detected but underestimated the 
      repeat size for larger expansions, and the normal alleles distribution at each 
      locus should be taken into account to detect expansions. Exome combined with 
      ExpansionHunter is reliable to detect repeat expansions in selected loci as 
      first-line analysis in spinocerebellar ataxia.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic efficacy of clinical 
      exome-targeted sequencing (CES) and spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36) screening 
      in a real-life cohort of patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) from Eastern Spain. 
      METHODS: A total of 130 unrelated patients with CA, negative for common 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, 
      SCA17, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA], and Friedreich ataxia), were 
      studied with CES. Bioinformatic and genotype-phenotype analyses were performed to 
      assess the pathogenicity of the variants encountered. Copy number variants were 
      analyzed when appropriate. In undiagnosed dominant and sporadic cases, repeat 
      primed PCR was used to screen for the presence of a repeat expansion in the NOP56 
      gene. RESULTS: CES identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 50 
      families (39%), including 23 novel variants. Overall, there was a high genetic 
      heterogeneity, and the most frequent genetic diagnosis was SPG7 (n = 15), 
      followed by SETX (n = 6), CACNA1A (n = 5), POLR3A (n = 4), and SYNE1 (n = 3). In 
      addition, 17 families displayed likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants in 14 
      different genes: KCND3 (n = 2), KIF1C (n = 2), CYP27A1A (n = 2), AFG3L2 (n = 1), 
      ANO10 (n = 1), CAPN1 (n = 1), CWF19L1 (n = 1), ITPR1 (n = 1), KCNA1 (n = 1), OPA1 
      (n = 1), PNPLA6 (n = 1), SPG11 (n = 1), SPTBN2 (n = 1), and TPP1 (n = 1). 
      Twenty-two novel variants were characterized. SCA36 was diagnosed in 11 families, 
      all with autosomal dominant (AD) presentation. SCA36 screening increased the 
      total diagnostic rate to 47% (n = 61/130). Ultimately, undiagnosed patients 
      showed delayed age at onset (p < 0.05) and were more frequently sporadic. 
      DISCUSSION: Our study provides insight into the genetic landscape of CA in 
      Eastern Spain. Although CES was an effective approach to capture genetic 
      heterogeneity, most patients remained undiagnosed. SCA36 was found to be a 
      relatively frequent form and, therefore, should be tested prior to CES in 
      familial AD presentations in particular geographical regions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansion disorders affect about 1 in 3000 individuals and are 
      clinically heterogeneous diseases caused by expansions of short tandem DNA 
      repeats. Genetic testing is often locus-specific, resulting in underdiagnosis of 
      people who have atypical clinical presentations, especially in paediatric 
      patients without a previous positive family history. Whole genome sequencing is 
      increasingly used as a first-line test for other rare genetic disorders, and we 
      aimed to assess its performance in the diagnosis of patients with neurological 
      repeat expansion disorders. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic 
      accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect the most common repeat expansion 
      loci associated with neurological outcomes (AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, 
      C9orf72, CACNA1A, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, and TBP) using samples obtained within 
      the National Health Service in England from patients who were suspected of having 
      neurological disorders; previous PCR test results were used as the reference 
      standard. The clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat 
      expansions was prospectively examined in previously genetically tested and 
      undiagnosed patients recruited in 2013-17 to the 100 000 Genomes Project in the 
      UK, who were suspected of having a genetic neurological disorder (familial or 
      early-onset forms of ataxia, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, dementia, motor 
      neuron disease, parkinsonian movement disorders, intellectual disability, or 
      neuromuscular disorders). If a repeat expansion call was made using whole genome 
      sequencing, PCR was used to confirm the result. FINDINGS: The diagnostic accuracy 
      of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat expansions was evaluated against 793 
      PCR tests previously performed within the NHS from 404 patients. Whole genome 
      sequencing correctly classified 215 of 221 expanded alleles and 1316 of 1321 
      non-expanded alleles, showing 97.3% sensitivity (95% CI 94.2-99.0) and 99.6% 
      specificity (99.1-99.9) across the 13 disease-associated loci when compared with 
      PCR test results. In samples from 11 631 patients in the 100 000 Genomes Project, 
      whole genome sequencing identified 81 repeat expansions, which were also tested 
      by PCR: 68 were confirmed as repeat expansions in the full pathogenic range, 11 
      were non-pathogenic intermediate expansions or premutations, and two were 
      non-expanded repeats (16% false discovery rate). INTERPRETATION: In our study, 
      whole genome sequencing for the detection of repeat expansions showed high 
      sensitivity and specificity, and it led to identification of neurological repeat 
      expansion disorders in previously undiagnosed patients. These findings support 
      implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical laboratories for diagnosis 
      of patients who have a neurological presentation consistent with a repeat 
      expansion disorder. FUNDING: Medical Research Council, Department of Health and

AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a devastating genetic disease 
      presenting myoclonus, epilepsy, ataxia, and dementia. DRPLA is caused by the 
      expansion of a CAG repeat in the ATN1 gene. Aggregation of the 
      polyglutamine-expanded ATN1 protein causes neuro-degeneration of the 
      dentatorubral and pallidoluysian systems. The expanded CAG repeats are unstable, 
      and ongoing repeat expansions contribute to disease onset, progression, and 
      severity. Inducing contractions of expanded repeats can be a means to treat 
      DRPLA, for which no disease-modifying or curative therapies exist at present. 
      Previously, we characterized a small molecule, naphthyridine-azaquinolone (NA), 
      which binds to CAG slip-out structures and induces repeat contraction in 
      Huntington's disease mice. Here, we demonstrate that long-term 
      intracerebroventricular infusion of NA leads to repeat contraction, reductions in 
      mutant ATN1 aggregation, and improved motor phenotype in a murine model of DRPLA. 
      Furthermore, NA-induced contraction resulted in the modification of 
      repeat-length-dependent dysregulation of gene expression profiles in DRPLA mice. 
      Our study reveals the therapeutic potential of repeat contracting small molecules 
      for repeat expansion disorders, such as DRPLA.

AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion disorder with an autosomal-dominant mode of inheritance and very low 
      prevalence in Europe. We herein report the clinical characteristics of the first 
      Austrian DRPLA family. Genetic analysis revealed the presence of a common 
      European haplotype, suggesting a founder mutation in Europe.

TI  - DRPLA: understanding the natural history and developing biomarkers to accelerate 
      therapeutic trials in a globally rare repeat expansion disorder.

AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by CAG repeat expansions in the atrophin-1 gene and is inherited in an 
      autosomal dominant fashion. There are currently no disease-modifying treatments 
      available. The broad development of therapies for DRPLA, as well as other similar 
      rare diseases, has hit a roadblock due to the rarity of the condition and the 
      wide global distribution of patients and families, consequently inhibiting 
      biomarker development and therapeutic research. Considering the shifting focus 
      towards diverse populations, widespread genetic testing, rapid advancements in 
      the development of clinical and wet biomarkers for Huntington's disease (HD), and 
      the ongoing clinical trials for antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies, the 
      prospect of developing effective treatments in rare disorders has completely 
      changed. The awareness of the HD ASO program has prompted global collaboration 
      for rare disorders in natural history studies and the development of biomarkers, 
      with the eventual goal of undergoing treatment trials. Here, we discuss DRPLA, 
      which shares similarities with HD, and how in this and other repeat expansion 
      disorders, neurogenetics groups like ours at UCL are gearing up for forthcoming 
      natural history studies to accelerate future ASO treatment trials to hopefully 
      emulate the progress seen in HD.

AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG nucleotide repeat expansion in 
      atrophin 1. A previous report described cerebellar white matter lesions on 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in elderly-onset DRPLA patients, but this 
      finding has not been fully investigated in a total population of DRPLA patients, 
      including juvenile or early-adult onset patients. Herein, we attempted to 
      determine the frequency, distribution pattern, and features of the cerebellar 
      white matter lesions in 30 consecutive DRPLA patients. We also assessed the 
      relationships between the cerebellar white matter lesions and clinical parameters 
      and other MRI findings. The cerebellar white matter lesions were found in 43% of 
      the 30 DRPLA patients, and in 70% of the late adult-onset DRPLA patients. In 
      approx. Two-thirds of the patients with cerebellar white matter lesions, the 
      lesions were localized in the paravermal area (paravermal lesions). Multiple 
      logistic regression analyses revealed that the Fazekas grade of 'cerebral' white 
      matter lesions was independently associated with 'cerebellar' white matter 
      lesions. In conclusion, cerebellar white matter lesions are one of the 
      distinctive MRI features in DRPLA patients, especially in patients with older age 
      at onset. Cerebellar white matter lesions, as well as cerebral white matter 
      lesions, might originate from the disease process of DRPLA itself, and they often 
      have a characteristic distribution of paravermal lesions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnostic workup for choreiform movement disorders including 
      Huntington's disease (HD) and those mimicking HD like phenotype is complex. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to genetically define HD and HD-like 
      presentations in an Indian cohort. We also describe HTT-CAG expansion manifesting 
      as neuroferritinopathy-like disorder in four families from Punjab in India. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: 159 patients clinically diagnosed as HD and HD-like 
      presentations from various tertiary neurology clinics were referred to our centre 
      (CSIR-IGIB) for genetic investigations. As a first tier test, CAG-TNR for HTT was 
      performed and subsequently HD-negative samples were screened for JPH3 (HDL2), TBP 
      (SCA17), ATN1 (DRPLA), PPP2R2B (SCA12) and GGGGCC expansion in C9orf72 gene. Four 
      families presenting as neuroferritinopathy-like disorder were also investigated 
      for HTT-CAG expansion. RESULTS: 94 of 159 (59%) patients were found to have 
      expanded HTT-CAG repeats. Pathogenic repeat expansion in JPH3, TBP, ATN1 and 
      C9orf72 were not found in HD negative cases. Two patients were positive for 
      SCA12-CAG expansion in pathogenic length, whereas 5 cases harboured TBP-CAG 
      repeats falling in reduced penetrance range of 41- 48 repeats for SCA17. Four 
      unrelated families, presented with atypical chorea and brain MRI findings 
      suggestive of basal ganglia abnormalities mimicking neuroferritinopathy were 
      found to harbour HTT-CAG expansion. CONCLUSION: We present SCA12 as a new 
      reported phenocopy of HD which should be considered for diagnostic workout along 
      with SCA17 for HD-like syndromes. This study also illustrates the necessity, to 
      consider evolving HD like phenotype, as a clinical diagnosis for cases with 
      initial manifestations depicting neuroferritinopathy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is a great deal of heterogeneity, both phenotypically and 
      genotypically among the autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA). Their 
      prevalence also varies in different populations. Trinucleotide repeat expansions 
      (CTG/CAG) have been shown predominantly to cause a number of ADCAs. AIM: The 
      present study describes the frequency of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) and the 
      CAG repeat sizes among the different regions of India. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: 
      Molecular data from our central reference laboratory were retrospectively 
      analyzed for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, 17 and DRPLA. Correlation between age at 
      diagnosis and the CAG repeats of the expanded and the normal alleles were tested 
      with the Spearman correlation test. RESULTS: The presence of SCAs vary according 
      to geographical regions and ethnicities; SCA 12 was detected with the highest 
      frequency (229/901), but was restricted to a specific ethnic population, followed 
      by SCA 2 with a positivity of 12% (101/845). SCA 3 previously known as 
      Machado-Joseph Disease had a prevalence of 4.05% (32/789), whereas SCA 1 was 
      diagnosed in 30/773 (3.88%). No positivity was seen for SCA 10 from the 103 
      samples tested and for SCA 17 from the 131 samples tested either as a part of an 
      extended panel or stand-alone. CONCLUSION: In this report, we are able to expand 
      the portrait of SCAs in India by presenting the largest ever molecular data from 
      a central reference laboratory.

AB  - Dentato-Rubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a rare autosomal, dominant, 
      progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes involuntary movements, mental 
      and emotional problems. DRPLA is caused by a mutation in the ATN1 gene that 
      encodes for an abnormal polyglutamine stretch in the atrophin-1 protein. DRPLA is 
      most common in the Japanese population, where it has an estimated incidence of 2 
      to 7 per million people. This condition has also been seen in families from North 
      America and Europe. We obtained a reprogrammed iPSC line from a Caucasian patient 
      with a juvenile onset of the disease, carrying 64 CAG repeat expansion in the 
      ATN1 gene.

TI  - (CAG)(n) loci as genetic modifiers of age at onset in patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 from mainland China.
PG  - 1130-1136
LID - 10.1111/ene.13954 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The expanded repeat length in ATXN1 negatively correlates 
      with age at onset (AAO) of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) but can explain 
      only part of it, indicating that other factors affect AAO. Some studies have 
      explored the influence of non-causative CAG repeats on the AAO of SCA patients. 
      However, studies on Chinese SCA1 patients regarding candidate modifier factors 
      involved in the variability in AAO are rare. METHODS: In all, 152 Chinese SCA1 
      patients who were genotyped for ATXN1 and nine other (CAG)(n) -containing genes 
      were enrolled. Regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of the 
      expanded allele of ATXN1 (linear and quadratic effects) on AAO. Then, different 
      models were used to explore the modulatory effect of nine other (CAG)(n) 
      -containing genes. RESULTS: Our results verified the negative effect of the 
      expanded allele in ATXN1 by regression analysis. Some (CAG)(n) -containing genes 
      including TBP, ATN1 and HTT modified AAO with variance ranging from 0.8% to 3.8% 
      and tended to decrease or delay AAO. However, no modifier effects of ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, KCNN3, RAI1 and normal ATXN1 alleles in trans were 
      detected. CONCLUSION: By using interaction analyses, TBP, ATN1 and HTT were 
      determined to have modifying effects. Our study revealed that differences in 
      modulation may be due to ethnic and geographic diversity across different 
      populations. Furthermore, the variability of AAO was not completely explained by 
      the genetic modifiers examined here, suggesting that other genetic or 
      environmental factors are involved in these diseases.

AB  - Polyglutamine expansions in the transcriptional co-repressor Atrophin-1, encoded 
      by ATN1, cause the neurodegenerative condition dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA) via a proposed novel toxic gain of function. We present detailed 
      phenotypic information on eight unrelated individuals who have de novo missense 
      and insertion variants within a conserved 16-amino-acid "HX repeat" motif of 
      ATN1. Each of the affected individuals has severe cognitive impairment and 
      hypotonia, a recognizable facial gestalt, and variable congenital anomalies. 
      However, they lack the progressive symptoms typical of DRPLA neurodegeneration. 
      To distinguish this subset of affected individuals from the DRPLA diagnosis, we 
      suggest using the term CHEDDA (congenital hypotonia, epilepsy, developmental 
      delay, digit abnormalities) to classify the condition. CHEDDA-related variants 
      alter the particular structural features of the HX repeat motif, suggesting that 
      CHEDDA results from perturbation of the structural and functional integrity of 
      the HX repeat. We found several non-homologous human genes containing similar 
      motifs of eight to 10 HX repeat sequences, including RERE, where disruptive 
      variants in this motif have also been linked to a separate condition that causes 
      neurocognitive and congenital anomalies. These findings suggest that perturbation 
      of the HX motif might explain other Mendelian human conditions.

      (now classified as Val50Met) substitution in TTR. Age at onset (AO) ranges from 
      19 to 82 years, and variability exists mostly between generations. Unstable 
      oligonucleotide repeats in various genes are the mechanism behind several 
      neurological diseases, found also to act as modifiers for other disorders. Our 
      aim was to investigate whether large normal repeat alleles of 10 genes had a 
      possible modifier effect in AO in Portuguese TTR-FAP Val30Met families. METHODS: 
      We analyzed 329 Portuguese patients from 123 families. Repeat length (at ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, TBP, ATN1, HTT, JPH3, AR, and DMPK) was assessed by single 
      and multiplex polymerase chain reaction, using fluorescently labeled primers, 
      followed by capillary electrophoresis. We used a family-centered approach, and 
      generalized estimating equations were used to account for AO correlation between 
      family members. RESULTS: For ATXN2, the presence of at least 1 allele longer than 
      22 CAGs was significantly associated with an earlier onset in TTR-FAP Val30Met, 
      decreasing mean AO by 6 years (95% confidence interval = -8.81 to -2.19, p = 
      0.001). No association was found for the remaining repeat loci. INTERPRETATION: 
      Length of normal repeats at ATXN2 may modify AO in TTR-FAP Val30Met and may 
      function as a risk factor. This can be due to the role of ATXN2 in RNA metabolism 
      and as a modulator of various cellular processes, including mitochondrial stress. 
      This may have relevant implications for prognosis and the follow-up of 
      presymptomatic carriers. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:251-258.

AB  - Genomewide association studies (GWASs) have contributed greatly to unraveling the 
      genetic basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a large amount of "missing 
      heritability" remains. In this exploratory study, we investigated the effect of 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in polyglutamine disease-associated genes 
      (PDAGs) on the risk of AD and its expression. In a cohort of 959 patients 
      diagnosed with AD (Amsterdam Dementia cohort) and 4106 cognitively healthy 
      participants (Leiden 85-plus Study and the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in 
      the Elderly at Risk), we determined the CAG repeat sequences in ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, HTT, ATN1, and AR. We did not find a significant 
      association between the risk of AD and variations in CAG repeat numbers of PDAGs. 
      However, we found that differences in CAG repeat numbers in ATXN1, ATXN2, and AR 
      were significantly associated with several clinical and imaging features in AD 
      patients. Specifically, the association between memory performance in patients 
      with AD and the CAG repeat size in the longer ATXN1 allele, and the association 
      between atrophy in the medial temporal lobes and the CAG repeat number in the 
      longer AR allele remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Our 
      findings suggest that repeat polymorphisms in ATXN1 and AR can act as important 
      genetic modifiers of AD, warranting further scrutiny of their role in its missing 
      heritability and pathogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The worldwide prevalence of obesity, a major risk factor for numerous 
      debilitating chronic disorders, is increasing rapidly. Although a substantial 
      amount of the variation in body mass index (BMI) is estimated to be heritable, 
      the largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to date 
      explained only ~2.7% of the variation. To tackle this 'missing heritability' 
      problem of obesity, here we focused on the contribution of DNA repeat length 
      polymorphisms which are not detectable by GWAS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We 
      determined the cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat length in the nine known 
      polyglutamine disease-associated genes (ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, 
      HTT, ATN1 and AR) in two large cohorts consisting of 12,457 individuals and 
      analyzed their association with BMI, using generalized linear mixed-effect 
      models. RESULTS: We found a significant association between BMI and the length of 
      CAG repeats in seven polyglutamine disease-associated genes (including ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP and AR). Importantly, these repeat variations 
      could account for 0.75% of the total BMI variation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      incriminate repeat polymorphisms as an important novel class of genetic risk 
      factors of obesity and highlight the role of the brain in its pathophysiology.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, characterised 
      by a triad of movement disorder, emotional and behavioural disturbances and 
      cognitive impairment. The underlying cause is an expanded CAG repeat in the 
      huntingtin gene. For a small proportion of patients presenting with HD-like 
      symptoms, the mutation in this gene is not identified and they are said to have a 
      HD "phenocopy". South Africa has the highest number of recorded cases of an 
      African-specific phenocopy, Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2), caused by a repeat 
      expansion in the junctophilin-3 gene. However, a significant proportion of black 
      patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of HD still test negative for HD and 
      HDL2. This study thus aimed to investigate five other loci associated with HD 
      phenocopy syndromes - ATN1, ATXN2, ATXN7, TBP and C9orf72. In a sample of 
      patients in whom HD and HDL2 had been excluded, a single expansion was identified 
      in the ATXN2 gene, confirming a diagnosis of Spinocerebellar ataxia 2. The 
      results indicate that common repeat expansion disorders do not contribute 
      significantly to the HD-like phenotype in black South African patients. 
      Importantly, allele sizing reveals unique distributions of normal repeat lengths 
      across the associated loci in the African population studied.

AB  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an adult onset, progressive, neurodegenerative 
      disorder of unknown etiology characterized by autonomic dysfunction, parkinsonism 
      (MSA-P) and cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C). The phenotypic spectrum may present 
      overlapping features with other neurodegenerative diseases, particularly the 
      autosomal dominant inherited polyglutamine disorders. To investigate the possible 
      contribution of CAG expansions in the MSA phenotype, we analyzed the triplet 
      repeat length in the autosomal dominant causative genes for spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) type 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 17, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) 
      and Huntington disease (HD) in a cohort of 246 Italian MSA patients. As 
      comparison, 223 controls were also analyzed. The alleles were classified on the 
      basis of CAG repeat length as "normal", "intermediate" or "expanded" according to 
      literature. The MSA patients (101 men/145 women) had a mean age at onset of 58 
      years and a mean age at genetic testing of 63 years. MSA-C patients had 
      significantly younger age at onset and at examination in comparison to MSA-P 
      (p...<...0.0001). We identified a SCA1 intermediate allele in a MSA-C subject (36 
      CAG), a SCA2 intermediate allele in a MSA-P patient (31 CAG), and a 
      pathologically expanded SCA2 allele (36 CAG) in a patient initially misdiagnosed 
      as MSA-C. No intermediate or expanded SCA alleles were detected in controls. The 
      distribution of CAG repeat length was similar among groups except for SCA1 gene 
      that showed a higher percentage of longer normal alleles in MSA-C as compared to 
      MSA-P and controls (p...<...0.0001). This study supports the utility of polyQ genetic 
      testing in the differential diagnosis of MSA, and may suggest a possible role of 
      SCA1 repeat length as risk factor for MSA-C. SCA1 and SCA2 genetic screening is 
      recommended in MSA Italian patients.

AB  - Cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansions in the coding regions of nine 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) genes (HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATN1, AR, 
      and TBP) are the cause of several neurodegenerative diseases including 
      Huntington's disease (HD), six different spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. The 
      expanded CAG repeat length in the causative gene is negatively related to the 
      age-at-onset (AAO) of clinical symptoms. In addition to the expanded CAG repeat 
      length in the causative gene, the normal CAG repeats in the other polyQ genes can 
      affect the AAO, suggesting functional interactions between the polyQ genes. 
      However, there is no detailed assessment of the relationships among polyQ genes 
      in pathologically relevant brain regions. We used gene co-expression analysis to 
      study the functional relationships among polyQ genes in different brain regions 
      using the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), a spatial map of gene expression in the 
      healthy brain. We constructed co-expression networks for seven anatomical brain 
      structures, as well as a region showing a specific pattern of atrophy in HD 
      patients detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. In this 
      HD-associated region, we found that ATN1 and ATXN2 were co-expressed and shared 
      co-expression partners which were enriched for DNA repair genes. We observed a 
      similar co-expression pattern in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and striatum in 
      which this relation was most pronounced. Given that the co-expression patterns 
      for these anatomical structures were similar to those for the HD-associated 
      region, our results suggest that their disruption is likely involved in HD 
      pathology. Moreover, ATN1 and ATXN2 also shared many co-expressed genes with HTT, 
      the causative gene of HD, across the brain. Although this triangular relationship 
      among these three polyQ genes may also be dysregulated in other polyQ diseases, 
      stronger co-expression patterns between ATN1 and ATXN2 observed in the 
      HD-associated region, especially in the striatum, may be more specific to HD.

TI  - Genetic Screening for Spinocerebellar Ataxia Genes in a Japanese Single-Hospital 
      Cohort.
PG  - 116-122
LID - 10.14802/jmd.17011 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diagnosis of sporadic cerebellar ataxia is a challenge for 
      neurologists. A wide range of potential causes exist, including chronic alcohol 
      use, multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type (MSA-C), and sporadic late 
      cortical cerebellar atrophy. Recently, an autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) mutation was identified in a cohort of patients with non-MSA-C 
      sporadic cerebellar ataxia. The aim of this study is to genetically screen genes 
      involved in SCA in a Japanese single-hospital cohort. METHODS: Over an 8-year 
      period, 140 patients with cerebellar ataxia were observed. There were 109 
      patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia (no family history for at least four 
      generations, 73 patients with MSA-C, and 36 patients with non-MSA-C sporadic 
      cerebellar ataxia) and 31 patients with familial cerebellar ataxia. We performed 
      gene analysis comprising SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 17, 31, and 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) in 28 of 31 non-MSA-C sporadic 
      patients who requested the test. Familial patients served as a control. RESULTS: 
      Gene abnormalities were found in 57% of non-MSA-C sporadic cerebellar ataxia 
      cases. Among patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia, abnormalities in SCA6 were 
      the most common (36%), followed by abnormalities in SCA1 (7.1%), SCA2 (3.6%), 
      SCA3 (3.6%), SCA8 (3.6%), and DRPLA (3.6%). In contrast, gene abnormalities were 
      found in 75% of familial cerebellar ataxia cases, with abnormalities in SCA6 
      being the most common (29%). For sporadic versus familial cases for those with 
      SCA6 abnormalities, the age of onset was older (69 years vs. 59 years, 
      respectively), and CAG repeat length was shorter (23 vs. 25, respectively) in the 
      former than in the latter (not statistically significant). CONCLUSION: 
      Autosomal-dominant mutations in SCA genes, particularly in SCA6, are not rare in 
      sporadic cerebellar ataxia. The reason for the frequency of mutations in SCA6 
      remains unclear; however, the reason may reflect a higher age at onset and 
      variable penetrance of SCA6 mutations.

TI  - Large normal-range TBP and ATXN7 CAG repeat lengths are associated with increased 
      lifetime risk of depression.
PG  - e1143
LID - 10.1038/tp.2017.116 [doi]
AB  - Depression is one of the most prevalent and debilitating psychiatric disorders 
      worldwide. Recently, we showed that both relatively short and relatively long 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in the huntingtin gene (HTT) are 
      associated with an increased risk of lifetime depression. However, to what extent 
      the variations in CAG repeat length in the other eight polyglutamine 
      disease-associated genes (PDAGs) are associated with depression is still unknown. 
      We determined the CAG repeat sizes of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, 
      ATN1 and AR in two well-characterized Dutch cohorts-the Netherlands Study of 
      Depression and Anxiety and the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older 
      Persons-including 2165 depressed and 1058 non-depressed individuals-aged 18-93 
      years. The association between PDAG CAG repeat size and the risk for depression 
      was assessed via binary logistic regression. We found that the odds ratio (OR) 
      for lifetime depression was significantly higher for individuals with >10, 
      compared with subjects with </=10, CAG repeats in both ATXN7 alleles (OR=1.90, 
      confidence interval (CI) 1.26-2.85). For TBP we found a similar association: A 
      CAG repeat length exceeding the median in both alleles was associated with an 
      increased risk for lifetime depression (OR=1.33, CI 1.00-1.76). In conclusion, we 
      observed that carriers of either ATXN7 or TBP alleles with relatively large CAG 
      repeat sizes in both alleles had a substantially increased risk of lifetime 
      depression. Our findings provide critical evidence for the notion that repeat 
      polymorphisms can act as complex genetic modifiers of depression.

AB  - Spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) is a group of disorders characterized by 
      progressive ataxia caused by dysfunction and atrophy of the cerebellum or its 
      projections. Approximately one-third of SCD cases are familial SCD, the majority 
      of which are attributed to CAG triplet repeat expansions including 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, and dentate-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      triplet repeat number of the alleles representing complete penetrance varies 
      among diseases. Generally, there is a gap between the normal alleles and the 
      complete penetrance alleles. Rarely, intermediate alleles with the repeat numbers 
      between the abnormal and normal ranges are observed, although the implications of 
      these intermediate alleles remain ambiguous.

TI  - Expanding the Spectrum of Genes Involved in Huntington Disease Using a Combined 
      Clinical and Genetic Approach.
PG  - 1105-14

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Huntington disease (HD), a prototypic monogenic disease, is caused by 
      an expanded CAG repeat in the HTT gene exceeding 35 units. However, not all 
      patients with an HD phenotype carry the pathological expansion in HTT, and the 
      positive diagnosis rate is poor. OBJECTIVES: To examine patients with HD 
      phenotypes to determine the frequency of HD phenocopies with typical features of 
      HD but without pathological CAG repeat expansions in HTT in an attempt to improve 
      the positive diagnosis rate. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between January 
      1, 2004, and April 18, 2011, a total of 226 consecutive index patients with an HD 
      phenotype were referred to specialized clinics of the French National Huntington 
      Disease Reference Centre for Rare Diseases. They underwent detailed clinical 
      examination and follow-up, as well as neuropsychological, biological, imaging, 
      and genetic examinations. Nucleotide expansions in JPH3, ATN1, TBP, and C9ORF72 
      and mutations in PRNP, as well as acquired conditions commonly causing HD 
      phenocopies, were first screened. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The diagnostic rate 
      of HD phenocopies and frequency of other etiologies using deep clinical 
      phenotyping and next generation sequencing. Our goal was to improve the genetic 
      diagnosis of HD phenocopies and to identify new HD related genes. RESULTS: One 
      hundred ninety-eight patients carried a pathological CAG repeat expansion in HTT, 
      whereas 28 patients (12 women and 16 men) did not. Huntington disease phenocopies 
      accounted for 12.4%, and their mean (SD) age at onset was similar to those of the 
      HD-HTT group (47.3 [12.7] years vs 50.3 [16.4] years, P = .29). We first 
      identified 3 patients with abnormal CTG expansions in JPH3, a fourth patient with 
      an antiphospholipid syndrome, and a fifth patient with B12 avitaminosis. A 
      custom-made 63-gene panel was generated based on clinical evolution and exome 
      sequencing. It contained genes responsible for HD phenocopies and other 
      neurodegenerative conditions, as well as candidate genes from exome sequencing in 
      3 index cases with imaging features of brain iron accumulation. We identified 
      mutations in genes associated with neurodegeneration, including CACNA1A (n = 2), 
      VPS13A (n = 1), UBQLN2 (n = 1), and VCP (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Huntington disease phenocopies without CAG repeat expansions in HTT are not rare, 
      occurring in 12.4% (28 of 226) herein, and should be considered in genetic 
      counseling. We used next-generation sequencing combined with clinical data and 
      disease evolution to explore multiple etiologies simultaneously. Our combined 
      clinical and genetic exploration of 28 HD phenocopies identified the underlying 
      cause in 35.7% (10 of 28). In conclusion, the etiologies of HD phenocopies are 
      heterogeneous, and clinical evolution should be taken into account when searching 
      for a genetic cause. The panel of candidate genes to be examined is larger than 
      expected but can be guided by specific imaging and clinical features. Other 
      neurodegenerative diseases with late onset in which variant segregation cannot be 
      verified could be productively explored with the combined approach illustrated 
      herein.

AB  - BACKGROUND: About 50 % of Thai patients with adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) was Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6. The author 
      investigated further on less common SCAs in the patients without any known 
      mutations. METHODS: DNA samples of 82 index patients who were genetically 
      excluded MJD, SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) were examined. Analysis of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, SCA17 and SCA19 genes were 
      comprehensively performed. Normal range of trinucleotide repeat expansion sizes 
      of TATA-box-binding protein gene (TBP) were also determined in 374 control 
      subjects. RESULTS: Eight patients carried >/=42 CAG/CAA repeat allele in the TBP 
      consistent with SCA17. The pathological repeat alleles ranged from 42 to 57 
      repeats. All patients had significant degree of cognitive dysfunction. Other 
      non-ataxic phenotypes comprised of parkinsonism, chorea, dystonia and myoclonus. 
      A sporadic patient carried a heterozygous 41-repeat allele developed chronic 
      progressive cerebellar degeneration commenced at the age of 28 years. Whilst, 2 % 
      of the control subjects (8/374) carried the 41-repeat allele. Five of the 
      carriers were re-examined, and revealed that four of them had parkinsonism and/or 
      cognitive impairment without cerebellar signs. Analysis of other types of SCAs 
      was all negative. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA17 and SCA19 in Thais. SCA17 appears to be an important cause of ataxia in 
      Thailand. Although, the pathological cut-off point of the TBP repeat allele 
      remains unclear, the finding suggests that the 41-repeat may be a pathological 
      allele resulting late-onset or mild phenotype. Apart from ataxia, cognitive 
      impairment and parkinsonism may be clinical presentations in these carriers.

      SCA-17 (TBP) and dentatorubral-pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA) (ATN1). METHODS: 
      Genetic analysis of repeat size in 10 degenerative hereditary ataxia loci was 
      performed in 323 essential tremor patients and 299 controls enrolled at Columbia 
      University. To test for differences in the allele distribution between patients 
      and controls, a CLUMP analysis was performed. RESULTS: None of the essential 
      tremor patients had a repeat expansion in the intermediate or pathogenic range. 
      Significant differences in the distribution of repeats in the 'normal' range for 
      SCA2 and SCA8 (both p </= 0.02) were observed between essential tremor patients and 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      SCA loci are not associated with essential tremor.

TI  - The first identified Central-Eastern European patient with genetically confirmed 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy.
PG  - 68-71
AB  - AIMS: Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an inherited 
      neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a trinucleotide repeat expansion. The 
      disease mainly occurs amongst the Japanese and is extremely rare in the European 
      population. The characteristic clinical symptoms are cerebellar ataxia, dementia, 
      choreoathetoid movements, epileptic seizures and myoclonus. The aim of this study 
      is to present the first genetically confirmed Hungarian case of DRPLA. CASE 
      REPORT: The middle-aged female patient developed the characteristic clinical 
      symptoms except myoclonus over her late thirties with positive family history. 
      The major finding in the skull magnetic resonance imaging was the atrophy of 
      infratentorial brain structures with the consequential dilation of related 
      cerebrospinal fluid spaces. A detailed neuropsychological examination was also 
      performed and it revealed moderate cognitive dysfunctions, mild depression and 
      anxiety. As underlying conditions, Huntington's disease and common 
      spinocerebellar ataxia forms all came into consideration, but all the result of 
      the respective genetic tests were negative. However, the test for mutation in the 
      ATN1 gene revealed pathological heterozygous CAG repeat expansion. CONCLUSION: 
      This case study serves as the first description of genetically confirmed DRPLA in 
      the Central-Eastern region of Europe, the clinical features of which seems to be 
      very similar to the previously reported cases.

AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that are related 
      to at least 36 different genetic loci; they are clinically characterized by 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia and are frequently accompanied by other 
      neurological and non-neurological manifestations. The relative frequency of SCA 
      varies greatly among different regions, presumably because of a founder effect or 
      local ethnicities. Between July 1998 and May 2012, we investigated 320 Brazilian 
      patients with an SCA phenotype who belonged to 150 unrelated families with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and 23 sporadic patients from 13 Brazilian 
      states. A total of 265 patients (82.8%) belonging to 131 unrelated families 
      (87.3%) were found to have a definite mutation, and SCA3 accounted for most of 
      the familial cases (70.7%), followed by SCA7 (6%), SCA1 (5.3%), SCA2 (2.7%), SCA6 
      (1.3%), SCA8 (0.7%) and SCA10 (0.7%). In the Ribeirao Preto mesoregion, which is 
      located in the northeast part of Sao Paulo State, the prevalence of SCA3 was 
      approximately 5 per 100,000 inhabitants, which is the highest prevalence found in 
      Brazil. No mutation was found in the SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA genes, and all the 
      sporadic cases remained without a molecular diagnosis. This study further 
      characterizes the spectrum of SCA mutations found in Brazilian patients, which 
      suggests the existence of regional differences and demonstrates the expansion of 
      the SCA8 locus in Brazilian families.

TI  - Modulation of the age at onset in spinocerebellar ataxia by CAG tracts in various 
      genes.
PG  - 2444-55
LID - 10.1093/brain/awu174 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine-coding (CAG)n repeat expansions in seven different genes cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxias. Although the size of the expansion is negatively 
      correlated with age at onset, it accounts for only 50-70% of its variability. To 
      find other factors involved in this variability, we performed a regression 
      analysis in 1255 affected individuals with identified expansions (spinocerebellar 
      ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7), recruited through the European Consortium on 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxias, to determine whether age at onset is influenced by the 
      size of the normal allele in eight causal (CAG)n-containing genes (ATXN1-3, 6-7, 
      17, ATN1 and HTT). We confirmed the negative effect of the expanded allele and 
      detected threshold effects reflected by a quadratic association between age at 
      onset and CAG size in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 3 and 6. We also evidenced 
      an interaction between the expanded and normal alleles in trans in individuals 
      with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 6 and 7. Except for individuals with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, age at onset was also influenced by other 
      (CAG)n-containing genes: ATXN7 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2; ATXN2, ATN1 and 
      HTT in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3; ATXN1 and ATXN3 in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 6; and ATXN3 and TBP in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7. This suggests that 
      there are biological relationships among these genes. The results were partially 
      replicated in four independent populations representing 460 Caucasians and 216 
      Asian samples; the differences are possibly explained by ethnic or geographical 
      differences. As the variability in age at onset is not completely explained by 
      the effects of the causative and modifier sister genes, other genetic or 
      environmental factors must also play a role in these diseases.

AB  - We evaluated the contributions of various polyglutamine (polyQ) disease genes to 
      Parkinson's disease (PD). We compared the distributions of polyQ repeat lengths 
      in 8 common genes (ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, ATN1, and HTT) in 
      299 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant PD (ADPD) and 329 normal controls. 
      We also analyzed the possibility of genetic interactions between ATXN1 and ATXN2, 
      ATXN2 and ATXN3, and ATXN2 and CACNA1A. Intermediate-length polyQ expansions (>24 
      Qs) of ATXN2 were found in 7 ADPD patients and no controls (7/299 = 2.34% and 
      0/329 = 0%, respectively; p = 0.0053 < 0.05/8 after Bonferroni correction). These 
      patients showed typical L-DOPA-responsive PD phenotypes. Conversely, no 
      significant differences in polyQ repeat lengths were found between the ADPD 
      patients and the controls for the other 7 genes. Our results may support the 
      hypothesis that ATXN2 polyQ expansion is a specific predisposing factor for 
      multiple neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases result from expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats 
      in their responsible genes. Although gene products with polyQ expansions undergo 
      conformational changes to aggregate in neurons, the relationship between 
      inclusions and neurotoxicity remains unclear. Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA) is a polyQ disease, and DRPLA protein, also known as atrophin-1 
      (ATN1), carries an expanded polyQ tract. To investigate how an expanded polyQ 
      tract influences ATN1 aggregation and localization, we compared the aggregation 
      of ATN1 with a polyQ tract to that of ATN1 with a polyleucine (polyL) tract. In 
      COS-7 cells, polyL-ATN1 triggered more aggregation than polyQ-ATN1 of similar 
      repeat sizes. Immunocytochemical and biochemical studies revealed that 
      replacement of the polyQ tract with polyL alters ATN1 localization, leading to 
      retention of polyL-ATN1 in the cytoplasm. Despite this change in localization, 
      polyL-ATN1 and polyQ-ATN1 demonstrate comparable repeat length dependent 
      toxicity. These results suggest that expanded polyQ repeats in ATN1 may 
      contribute to neurodegeneration via alterations in both protein aggregation and 
      intracellular localization.

AB  - Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is an X-linked motor neuron disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the androgen receptor (AR) gene. 
      Ligand-dependent nuclear accumulation of mutant AR protein is a critical 
      characteristic of the pathogenesis of SBMA. SBMA has been modeled in 
      AR-overexpressing animals, but precisely how the polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion 
      leads to neurodegeneration is unclear. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are 
      a new technology that can be used to model human diseases, study pathogenic 
      mechanisms, and develop novel drugs. We established SBMA patient-derived iPSCs, 
      investigated their cellular biochemical characteristics, and found that 
      SBMA-iPSCs can differentiate into motor neurons. The CAG repeat numbers in the AR 
      gene of SBMA-iPSCs and also in the atrophin-1 gene of iPSCs derived from another 
      polyQ disease, dentato-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy (DRPLA), remain unchanged 
      during reprogramming, long term passage, and differentiation, indicating that 
      polyQ disease-associated CAG repeats are stable during maintenance of iPSCs. The 
      level of AR expression is up-regulated by neuronal differentiation and treatment 
      with the AR ligand dihydrotestosterone. Filter retardation assays indicated that 
      aggregation of ARs following dihydrotestosterone treatment in neurons derived 
      from SBMA-iPSCs increases significantly compared with neurological control iPSCs, 
      easily recapitulating the pathological feature of mutant ARs in SBMA-iPSCs. This 
      phenomenon was not observed in iPSCs and fibroblasts, thereby showing the 
      neuron-dominant phenotype of this disease. Furthermore, the HSP90 inhibitor 
      17-allylaminogeldanamycin sharply decreased the level of aggregated AR in neurons 
      derived from SBMA-iPSCs, indicating a potential for discovery and validation of 
      candidate drugs. We found that SBMA-iPSCs possess disease-specific biochemical 
      features and could thus open new avenues of research into not only SBMA, but also 
      other polyglutamine diseases.

AB  - We delineate a complication of hypoalbuminemia in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA), which we have found to be common in this disorder. In addition, 
      we explored the pathogenesis of this phenomenon through clinical and histological 
      examinations. Clinical course and laboratory findings of nine patients with 
      childhood-onset DRPLA (aged 6-49 years; CAG repeat length 62-93) were 
      retrospectively reviewed. Autopsied specimens from three patients were examined 
      by histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses. Eight DRPLA patients 
      showed hypoalbuminemia <3.5 g/dl in the initial stages of the disease (age, 2-32 
      years), which correlated with the CAG repeat length in each patient. Disease 
      worsened in six patients, often triggered by febrile infections and accompanied 
      by increased urinary protein excretion. One patient showed increased fecal 
      alpha1-antitripsin while another showed accumulation of radioactive albumin in the 
      urinary and gastrointestinal tracts after intravenous infusion. 
      Immunohistochemistry revealed albumin-containing monocytes and astrocytes in the 
      perivascular areas of the cerebral white matter. Fluid collection in the 
      glomerular capillaries was noted. Immunolabeling using antibodies against the 
      expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) polypeptide was positive in cerebral cortical 
      neurons, hepatocytes, renal collecting ducts, and glomerular podocytes, which act 
      as filtration barrier against serum proteins. Serum albumin appears to easily 
      leak from blood vessels in certain visceral organs in DRPLA during later stages 
      of the illness, particularly in the kidneys of patients with largely expanded CAG 
      repeats. We hypothesize that the accumulation of the DRPLA gene product with 
      expanded polyQ sequences in the podocytes results in the dysfunction of the 
      glomerular filtration barrier.

AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) encompass a heterogeneous group of 
      rare diseases that affect the cerebellum and its connections. The most common 
      forms have been associated with dynamic mutations while some rarer forms with 
      conventional mutations. Studies in different populations revealed differences in 
      their relative frequencies both within and between the studied populations, 
      showing that the frequencies are depended on ethnic and geographical factors. 
      Previous investigation of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in the Cypriot population, revealed no 
      pathogenic expansion in the Cypriot SCA patients. We hereby present our recent 
      investigation of the SCA10 pentanucleotide repeat expansion. Forty-two 
      ascertained Cypriot sporadic ataxia patients, the index case from 1 ADCA and 14 
      ARCA families and a cohort of normal population individuals were included in the 
      study. All our patients have normal range ATXN10 gene ATTCT repeat numbers 
      (10-19). In the normal population group, repeat lengths ranged from 11 to 20 with 
      the 14 repeats allele being the most frequent. Therefore, all currently 
      established dynamic repeat SCA mutations are absent from the Cypriot population, 
      indicating distinct genetic causes.

AB  - To elucidate a relationship between CAG repeat expansion length and disease 
      progression history in patients with childhood-onset dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA). We retrospectively evaluated information from nine Japanese 
      patients with disease onset reported as between 6 months and 12 years of age. CAG 
      repeat length in these patients ranged from 62 to 93. A strong correlation was 
      confirmed for the age of disease onset, with the onset of epilepsy and 
      involuntary movements, emergence of regression, and autonomic symptoms. The age 
      at becoming wheelchair-bound and initiation of tube feeding also showed a 
      significant correlation with CAG repeat length. This is the first report 
      detailing this aspect of DRPLA focusing on the childhood-onset population. 
      Earlier disease milestones were revealed compared to the expected age based upon 
      a previous report that contained data from the entire patient population, 
      including adult-onset cases (Hasegawa et al. in Mov Disord 25:1694-1700, 2010). 
      These results provide a basis for predicting the outcome of patients in this 
      particular age group, as well as for assessing the results of future clinical 
      therapeutic trials.

      patients with cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 178-80
LID - 10.1016/j.jns.2012.03.019 [doi]
AB  - The relative frequency of different autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, 
      commonly referred to as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), varies considerably among 
      populations of different ethnic origin. No data exist at present on the frequency 
      of different SCAs in the Greek population. In the present study we investigated 
      the presence of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in a cohort of 83 Greek patients with slowly 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia. Twenty patients came from autosomal dominant (AD) 
      pedigrees, seven displayed recessive or unclear inheritance and 56 were sporadic. 
      We found four patients with pathological SCA expansions, all from AD pedigrees. 
      Two patients had SCA1, one SCA2 and one SCA7 (10.0, 5.0 and 5.0% of the AD group, 
      respectively). The clinical features of these patients were within the expected 
      spectrum. In total, a pathological expansion was detected in 20% of patients from 
      AD pedigrees. Interestingly, no cases of SCA3 or SCA6 were detected in the AD 
      group. No expansions were found in other familial cases or in sporadic patients. 
      Overall, no cases of SCA3, SCA6, SCA12, SCA17 or DRPLA were identified in the 
      Greek population. In conclusion, SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 are present in Greek 
      patients with AD cerebellar ataxia in frequencies similar to those observed in 
      other populations. SCA3 and SCA6 appear however to be rare in Greece. The genetic 
      cause for the majority of AD ataxias remains to be identified.

AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant progressive 
      neurodegenerative disorder with intellectual deterioration and various motor 
      deficits including ataxia, choreoathetosis, and myoclonus, caused by an abnormal 
      expansion of CAG repeats in the DRPLA gene. Longer expanded CAG repeats 
      contribute to an earlier age of onset, faster progression, and more severe 
      neurological symptoms in DRPLA patients. In this study, we have established DRPLA 
      transgenic mouse lines (sublines) harboring a single copy of the full-length 
      mutant human DRPLA gene carrying various lengths of expanded CAG repeats (Q76, 
      Q96, Q113, and Q129), which have clearly shown motor deficits and memory 
      disturbance whose severity increases with the length of expanded CAG repeats and 
      age, and successfully replicated the CAG repeat length- and age-dependent 
      features of DRPLA patients. Neuronal intranuclear accumulation of the mutant 
      DRPLA protein has been suggested to cause transcriptional dysregulation, leading 
      to alteration in gene expression and neuronal dysfunction. In this study, we have 
      conducted a comprehensive analysis of gene expression profiles in the cerebrum 
      and cerebellum of transgenic mouse lines at 4, 8, and 12 weeks using multiple 
      microarray platforms, and demonstrated that both the number and expression levels 
      of the altered genes are highly dependent on CAG repeat length and age in both 
      brain regions. Specific groups of genes and their function categories were 
      identified by further agglomerative cluster analysis and gene functional 
      annotation analysis. Calcium signaling and neuropeptide signaling, among others, 
      were implicated in the pathophysiology of DRPLA. Our study provides unprecedented 
      CAG-repeat-length-dependent mouse models of DRPLA, which are highly valuable not 
      only for elucidating the CAG-repeat-length-dependent pathophysiology of DRPLA but 
      also for developing therapeutic strategies for DRPLA.

TI  - Genetic screening of Greek patients with Huntington's disease phenocopies 
      identifies an SCA8 expansion.
PG  - 1874-8
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a 
      triad of chorea, psychiatric disturbance and cognitive decline. Around 1% of 
      patients with HD-like symptoms lack the causative HD expansion and are considered 
      HD phenocopies. Genetic diseases that can present as HD phenocopies include 
      HD-like syndromes such as HDL1, HDL2 and HDL4 (SCA17), some spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCAs) and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). In this study we 
      screened a cohort of 21 Greek patients with HD phenocopy syndromes formutations 
      causing HDL2, SCA17, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3,SCA8, SCA12 and DRPLA. Fifteen patients 
      (71%) had a positive family history. We identified one patient (4.8% of the total 
      cohort) with an expansion of 81 combined CTA/CTG repeats at the SCA8 locus. This 
      falls within what is believed to be the high-penetrance allele range. In addition 
      to the classic HD triad, the patient had features of dystonia and oculomotor 
      apraxia. There were no cases of HDL2, SCA17, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA12 or DRPLA. 
      Given the controversy surrounding the SCA8 expansion, the present finding may be 
      incidental. However, if pathogenic, it broadens the phenotype that may be 
      associated with SCA8 expansions. The absence of any other mutations in our cohort 
      is not surprising, given the low probability of reaching a genetic diagnosis in 
      HD phenocopy patients.

AB  - We screened a cohort of 181 patients with features of primary progressive ataxia 
      and chorea for spinocerebellar ataxias 17 (SCA17) mutation after excluding other 
      known SCAs, Huntington's disease (HD), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA), and non-genetic causes. This study included patients with known family 
      history of SCA, those with sporadic onset and cases of uncertain family history. 
      Two unrelated patients with Huntington's disease-like phenotype and cerebellar 
      signs are described with homozygous expansions of 47 and 48 CAG/CAA repeats. A 
      family member with early signs of ataxia was found to carry 37 and 48 repeats. 
      There were fewer CAA interruptions in the repeat sequences of patients than in 
      the controls. The normal repeat range in controls was 21-42, with 91% of the 
      alleles located between 33 and 39 repeats. This is the first report of rare 
      homozygous SCA17 mutation in Indian patients presenting with HD-like phenotype.

TI  - Long-term disability and prognosis in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy: a 
      correlation with CAG repeat length.
PG  - 1694-700
LID - 10.1002/mds.23167 [doi]
AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a rare autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG repeat expansion. Previous studies 
      demonstrated that the onset of DRPLA is closely associated with CAG repeat 
      length. However, the natural history of DRPLA has not yet been evaluated. We here 
      retrospectively investigated the factors that determine the disease milestones 
      and prognosis in 183 Japanese patients genetically diagnosed with DRPLA. We 
      determined the age at onset, age at which each of the subsequent clinical 
      manifestations appeared, age at becoming wheelchair-bound, and age at death. 
      Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the patients with CAG repeats larger than the 
      median length of 65 repeats developed each of the clinical features of DRPLA at a 
      younger age than those with <65 repeats. The patients became wheelchair-bound at 
      a median age of 33 years (n = 61; range, 3-77 years) and died at a median age of 
      49 years (n = 23; range, 18-80 years). The ages at becoming wheelchair-bound and 
      at death strongly correlated with the expanded CAG repeat length. Moreover, the 
      patients with >or=65 CAG repeats showed a more severe long-term disability and a 
      poorer prognosis. In contrast, the rate of progression after the onset did not 
      correlate with CAG repeat length. The CAG repeat length may have a considerable 
      effect on not only the disease onset but also the disease milestones and 
      prognosis in DRPLA patients. These effects of CAG repeat length may be relevant 
      in designing future clinical therapeutic trials.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of spinocerebellar ataxias in Cuba: insights into SCA2 
      founder effect in Holguin.
PG  - 157-60
LID - 10.1016/j.neulet.2009.03.015 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of hereditary ataxias 
      in Cuba, with a special focus on the clinical and molecular features of SCA2. 
      Clinical assessments were performed by neurological examinations and application 
      of the SARA scale. Molecular analyses of genes SCA1-3, SCA6, SCA17 and DRPLA 
      identified 753 patients with SCA and 7173 asymptomatic relatives, belonging to 
      200 unrelated families. 86.79% of all SCA patients were affected with SCA2. In 
      the Holguin province, the average population prevalence of SCA2 is 40.18x10(5) 
      inhabitants, with the remarkable figure of 141.66x10(5) in the Baguanos 
      municipality. The high prevalence of the SCA2 mutation in Holguin reflects most 
      likely a founder effect. The stabilization of the prevalence along time suggests 
      the existence of premutated chromosomes with pure CAG, acting as reservoir for 
      further expansions. CAG repeat length correlated inversely with age at onset, 
      accounting for 80% of the variability. Genetic anticipation was observed in the 
      80% of transmissions. Repeat instability was greater in paternal transmissions 
      whereas CAG expansions without anticipation was observed in 10.97% suggesting the 
      effect of CAA interruptions in the CAG segment, which decrease the toxicity of 
      the abnormal ataxin-2, and/or other protective factors.

TI  - SCA-LSVD: a repeat-oriented locus-specific variation database for genotype to 
      phenotype correlations in spinocerebellar ataxias.
PG  - 1037-42
LID - 10.1002/humu.21006 [doi]
AB  - Repeat expansion has been implicated in 10 out of 17 candidate genes identified 
      for autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs)-commonly referred as 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Though genetically distinct, the SCAs share a 
      large number of features that confound their clinical classification. In 
      addition, there is a difference in the prevalence and phenotypic expression of 
      ataxias between different ethnic groups. We have created a new SCA-locus-specific 
      variation database (LSVD) that aims to catalog and integrate information on SCAs 
      associated with trinucleotide repeat expansion (SCA1, SCA 2, SCA 3, SCA 6, SCA 7, 
      SCA 8, SCA 12, SCA 17, Friedreich's ataxia [FRDA], and 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA]) from all over the world. The 
      database has been developed using the Leiden Open (source) Variation Database 
      (LOVD) software (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands). The 
      database houses detailed information on clinical features, such as age and 
      symptom at onset, mode of inheritance, and genotype information, pertaining to 
      the SCA patients from more than 400 families across India. All the compiled 
      genotype data conforms to the HGVS Nomenclature guidelines. This would be a very 
      useful starting point for understanding the molecular correlates of phenotypes in 
      ataxia-a multilocus disease in which related molecular mechanisms converge to 
      overlapping phenotypes.

TI  - The genetic aetiology of late-onset chronic progressive cerebellar ataxia. A 
      population-based study.
PG  - 343-8
LID - 10.1007/s00415-009-0015-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increasing number of dominant and recessive disorders have been 
      associated with late onset chronic progressive ataxia (LOCA) complicating the 
      formulation of a rational diagnostic strategy. Furthermore, there is marked 
      geographic and ethnic variation in the relative importance of these individual 
      disorders and the cause of such observed variation remains unexplained. METHODS: 
      We have systematically investigated a population-based cohort of patients with 
      chronic progressive LOCA for SCA 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17, FXTAS and FRDA. In 
      addition we have examined repeat length polymorphism in chromosomes from a 
      genetically homogeneous and representative control population to investigate the 
      association of high-normal repeats and disease prevalence. RESULTS: A total of 
      178 patients including 55 familial cases segregating in 38 kindreds and 123 
      sporadic were investigated. Pathological expansions were identified in 11/38 
      (28.9 %) of families and in 5/123 (4.1 %) of sporadic patients. The most frequent 
      diagnoses were SCA6 (6 families and 1 sporadic patient), DRPLA (4 families) and 
      SCA8 (1 family). In addition, one elderly female patient was identified with 
      "possible FXTAS". Six (2 %) control patients were noted to have expanded SCA8 
      alleles. CONCLUSIONS: SCA6 and DRPLA were the most frequent genetic diagnoses 
      identified. Patterns of high-normal allele frequency in this UK population were 
      distinct compared to other ethnic groups but this was poorly predictive of the 
      distribution of disease in this region. The relative contribution of new mutation 
      formation and founder effects to the prevalence of familial ataxia is uncertain, 
      and further exploration of these factors will require detailed analysis of 
      disease allele haplotypes and meiotic instability of intermediate length alleles.

TI  - Severe neurological phenotypes of Q129 DRPLA transgenic mice serendipitously 
      created by en masse expansion of CAG repeats in Q76 DRPLA mice.
PG  - 723-36
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddn403 [doi]
AB  - We herein provide a thorough description of new transgenic mouse models for 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) harboring a single copy of the 
      full-length human mutant DRPLA gene with 76 and 129 CAG repeats. The Q129 mouse 
      line was unexpectedly obtained by en masse expansion based on the somatic 
      instability of 76 CAG repeats in vivo. The mRNA expression levels of both Q76 and 
      Q129 transgenes were each 80% of that of the endogenous mouse gene, whereas only 
      the Q129 mice exhibited devastating progressive neurological phenotypes similar 
      to those of juvenile-onset DRPLA patients. Electrophysiological studies of the 
      Q129 mice demonstrated age-dependent and region-specific presynaptic dysfunction 
      in the globus pallidus and cerebellum. Progressive shrinkage of distal dendrites 
      of Purkinje cells and decreased currents through 
      alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid and gamma-aminobutyrate 
      type A receptors in CA1 neurons were also observed. Neuropathological studies of 
      the Q129 mice revealed progressive brain atrophy, but no obvious neuronal loss, 
      associated with massive neuronal intranuclear accumulation (NIA) of mutant 
      proteins with expanded polyglutamine stretches starting on postnatal day 4, 
      whereas NIA in the Q76 mice appeared later with regional specificity to the 
      vulnerable regions of DRPLA. Expression profile analyses demonstrated 
      age-dependent down-regulation of genes, including those relevant to synaptic 
      functions and CREB-dependent genes. These results suggest that neuronal 
      dysfunction without neuronal death is the essential pathophysiologic process and 
      that the age-dependent NIA is associated with nuclear dysfunction including 
      transcriptional dysregulations. Thus, our Q129 mice should be highly valuable for 
      investigating the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic 
      interventions.

TI  - Molecular analysis of CAG repeats at five different spinocerebellar ataxia loci: 
      correlation and alternative explanations for disease pathogenesis.
PG  - 338-42
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are caused by expansion of (CAG)n triplet repeats. 
      These repeats occur as polymorphic forms in general population; however, beyond a 
      threshold size they become pathogenic. The sizes and distributions of repeats at 
      the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA7 and DRPLA loci were assessed by molecular analysis of 
      124 unrelated ataxia patients and 44 controls, and the association of larger 
      normal (LN) alleles with disease prevalence was evaluated. Triplet repeat 
      expansions in the disease range were detected in 8% (10/124) of the cases, with 
      the majority having expansion at the SCA1 locus. Normal allele ranges in the 
      cohort studied were similar to the Caucasian and North Indian populations but 
      differed from the Korean and Japanese populations at various loci. The percentage 
      of individuals with LN alleles at the SCA1 and SCA2 loci was higher than reported 
      in Indians, Japanese and Caucasians. LN alleles showed a good correlation with 
      the incidence of SCA1, indicating that SCA1 is the most prevalent ataxia in our 
      population. The majority of cases with clinical symptoms of SCA could not be 
      diagnosed by established CAG repeat criteria, suggesting that there may be an 
      alternative basis for disease pathogenesis: (i) Repeats lower than the normal 
      range may also result in abnormal phenotypes (ii) LN alleles at different loci in 
      the same individual may contribute to symptoms (iii) Exogenous factors may play a 
      role in triggering disease symptoms in individuals with LN alleles (iv) Triplet 
      repeats may reach the disease range in the brain but not in the blood.

TI  - Dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy in South Wales.
PG  - 804-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a rare, autosomal 
      dominant, clinically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterised 
      clinically by progressive dementia, ataxia, chorea, myoclonic epilepsy and 
      psychiatric disturbance and pathologically by combined degeneration of the 
      dentatorubral and pallidoluysian systems. DRPLA has a marked ethnic predilection, 
      most commonly reported in Japan and thought to be rare in Caucasian populations. 
      METHODS: We describe the clinical and genetic characteristics of 17 patients with 
      DRPLA segregating in four families in South Wales. RESULTS: There was marked 
      clinical heterogeneity with considerable overlap of symptoms and signs between 
      and within families. The age of onset ranged from 34 to 60 years with an earlier 
      onset associated with myoclonic epilepsy and a later onset associated with a 
      Huntington disease-like presentation. We identified a distinct haplotype within 
      one family not present within the other three families, suggesting that the 
      expansion in at least one family did not arise from an immediate common ancestor. 
      Analysis of repeat length polymorphisms in 306 Welsh control patients identified 
      14 (4.6%) with repeat lengths in the high-normal range, compared with 0% and 7.4% 
      in previously reported north American Caucasian and Japanese control populations, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: DRPLA may not be as geographically or ethnically 
      restricted as previously thought and the diagnosis should be considered in 
      non-Asian patients presenting with a wide spectrum of neurological disease, 
      especially if there is a dominant family history of dementia or movement 
      disorder. The prevalence of high-normal length alleles may account for the 
      relatively high prevalence of DRPLA in Wales.

TI  - Case control analysis of repeat expansion size in ataxia.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurological diseases. The expansion of unstable microsatellite 
      repeats has been identified as the underlying pathogenic cause of 10 subtypes of 
      autosomal dominant SCAs. The aetiology of sporadic SCA is unknown. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effect of large normal repeats in patients 
      presenting with sporadic or familial ataxia compared to a control population. The 
      size of the expansion was determined using a fluorescent PCR approach in 10 
      common SCA genes: SCA-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 (CACNA1A), 
      SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), SCA-17 (TBP) 
      and DRPLA (ATN1), in 165 ataxia patients and 307 controls of Welsh origin. There 
      was no difference between cases and controls in the distribution of the large 
      normal alleles, or in the distribution of the combined CAG repeats. The normal 
      allele distribution in the Welsh population was largely similar to that of other 
      Caucasian populations. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of large normal 
      repeats on the susceptibility to develop ataxia.

TI  - Multiplex families with multiple system atrophy.
PG  - 545-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) has been considered a sporadic disease, 
      without patterns of inheritance. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of 
      4 multiplex families with MSA, including clinical genetic aspects. DESIGN: 
      Clinical and genetic study. SETTING: Four departments of neurology in Japan. 
      Patients Eight patients in 4 families with parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and 
      autonomic failure with age at onset ranging from 58 to 72 years. Two siblings in 
      each family were affected with these conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical 
      evaluation was performed according to criteria by Gilman et al. Trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the responsible genes for the spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 
      series and for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) was evaluated by 
      polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequence analysis of coding regions in the 
      alpha-synuclein gene was performed. RESULTS: Consanguineous marriage was observed 
      in 1 of 4 families. Among 8 patients, 1 had definite MSA, 5 had probable MSA, and 
      2 had possible MSA. The most frequent phenotype was MSA with predominant 
      parkinsonism, observed in 5 patients. Six patients showed pontine atrophy with 
      cross sign or slitlike signal change at the posterolateral putaminal margin or 
      both on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Possibilities of hereditary ataxias, 
      including SCA1 (ataxin 1, ATXN1), SCA2 (ATXN2), Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3 
      (ATXN1), SCA6 (ATXN1), SCA7 (ATXN7), SCA12 (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory 
      subunit B, beta isoform; PP2R2B), SCA17 (TATA box binding protein, TBP) and DRPLA 
      (atrophin 1; ATN1), were excluded, and no mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene 
      were found. CONCLUSIONS: Findings in these multiplex families suggest the 
      presence of familial MSA with autosomal recessive inheritance and a genetic 
      predisposition to MSA. Molecular genetic approaches focusing on familial MSA are 
      expected to provide clues to the pathogenesis of MSA.

TI  - Effects of SCA1, MJD, and DPRLA triplet repeat polymorphisms on cognitive 
      phenotypes in a normal population of adolescent twins.
PG  - 95-100
AB  - The expansion of unstable trinucleotide CAG repeat polymorphisms of a number of 
      genes causes several neurodegenerative disorders with decreased cognitive 
      function, the severity of the disorder being related to allele length at the 
      triplet repeat locus. While the effects of repeat length have been well studied 
      in clinical samples, there has been little investigation of the effects of 
      triplet repeat variation in the normal range for these genes. We have, therefore, 
      examined linkage and association for three CAG triplet repeat markers 
      (Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1, SCA1; Machado-Joseph Disease, MJD; 
      Dentatorubro-pallidoluysian Atrophy, DRPLA) to assess their contribution to 
      variation in cognitive ability (IQ, reading ability, processing speed) in a 
      normal, unselected sample of adolescent twins (248 dizygotic (DZ) sibling pairs, 
      aged 16 years). Association tests, performed in Mx and QTDT, showed a consistent 
      positive association of SCA1 with Arithmetic (P = 0.04). While association was 
      supported between SCA1 and Cambridge reading scores and between DRPLA and 
      inspection time, results were inconsistent across software packages. Given the 
      number of statistical tests performed, it is unlikely that trinucleotide repeat 
      variation in the normal range for these genes influences variation in normal 
      cognition.

      as a cause of disease in Portuguese patients with a Huntington-like phenotype.
PG  - 645-651
LID - 10.1007/s10038-006-0001-9 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterised by chorea, cognitive impairment, dementia and personality changes, 
      caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the HD gene. Often, patients with a 
      similar clinical presentation do not carry expansions of the CAG repeat in this 
      gene [Huntington disease-like (HDL) patients]. We report the genetic analysis of 
      107 Portuguese patients with an HDL phenotype. The HDL genes PRNP and JPH3, 
      encoding the prion protein and junctophilin-3, respectively, were screened for 
      repeat expansions in these patients. Given the partial clinical overlap of SCA17, 
      DRPLA and neuroferritinopathy with HD, their causative genes (TBP, ATN1, and FTL, 
      respectively) were also analysed. Finally, repeat expansions in two candidate 
      genes, CREBBP and POU3F2, which encode the nuclear transcriptional coactivator 
      CREB-binding protein and the CNS-specific transcription factor N-Oct-3, 
      respectively, were also studied. Expansions of the repetitive tracts of the PRNP, 
      JPH3, TBP, ATN1, CREBBP and POU3F2 genes were excluded in all patients, as were 
      sequence alterations in the FTL gene. Since none of the genes already included in 
      the differential diagnosis of HD was responsible for the disease in our sample, 
      the genetic heterogeneity of the HDL phenotype is still open for investigation.

TI  - SCA28, a novel form of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia on chromosome 
      18p11.22-q11.2.
PG  - 235-42
AB  - We describe a four-generation Italian family with a novel form of juvenile-onset, 
      slowly progressive, autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia. Eleven affected family 
      members have been evaluated. The mean age at onset was 19.5 years with no 
      evidence of anticipation. The first symptoms were invariably unbalanced standing 
      and mild gait incoordination. Gaze-evoked nystagmus was prominent at onset, while 
      patients with longer disease duration developed slow saccades, ophthalmoparesis 
      and, often, ptosis. Deep tendon reflexes in lower limbs were increased in 80% of 
      the cases. Genetic analysis excluded the presence of pathological repeat 
      expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1-3, 6-8, 10, 12 and 17, and 
      DRPLA genes. Linkage exclusion tests showed no evidence of association with other 
      known SCA loci. A genome-wide screen analysis identified linkage with chromosome 
      18 markers. A maximum two-point limit of determination score of 4.20 was found 
      for marker D18S53. Haplotype analysis refined a critical region of 7.9 Mb between 
      markers D18S1418 and D18S1104. This new SCA locus on 18p11.22-q11.2 has been 
      designated SCA28. Candidate genes within the critical interval are currently 
      screened for mutations.

TI  - Cytoprotective effect of novel histone deacetylase inhibitors against 
      polyglutamine toxicity.
PG  - 213-5
AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurological disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the DRPLA gene encoding 
      polyglutamine (polyQ). Although previous experimental studies have demonstrated 
      that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are therapeutically active, known HDAC 
      inhibitors have considerable adverse effects clinically. To identify new HDAC 
      inhibitors for the treatment of DRPLA, we evaluated a new series of HDAC 
      inhibitors, N-hydroxycarboxamides, with our drug screening system, which uses 
      neuronal PC12 cells stably transfected with a part of the DRPLA gene. We found 
      that two of four N-hydroxycarboxamides significantly reduced polyQ-induced cell 
      death. The essential structure of these compounds is a hydroxamic acid residue, 
      which is shared with trichostatin A, a known HDAC inhibitor. Although our study 
      showed mild neuroprotective effects, further structural modification of compounds 
      that retain this residue may decrease cytotoxicity and increase protective 
      activity against polyQ toxicity.

TI  - Comparative genetics of functional trinucleotide tandem repeats in humans and 
      apes.
PG  - 329-39
AB  - Several human neurodegenerative disorders are caused by the expansion of 
      polymorphic trinucleotide repeat regions. Many of these loci are functional short 
      tandem repeats (STRs) located in brain-expressed genes, and their study is thus 
      relevant from both a medical and an evolutionary point of view. The aims of our 
      study are to infer the comparative pattern of variation and evolution of this set 
      of loci in order to show species-specific features in this group of STRs and on 
      their potential for expansion (therefore, an insight into evolutionary medicine) 
      and to unravel whether any human-specific feature may be identified in 
      brain-expressed genes involved in human disease. We analyzed the variability of 
      the normal range of seven expanding STR CAG/CTG loci (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3-MJD, SCA6, 
      SCA8, SCA12, and DRPLA) and two nonexpanding polymorphic CAG loci (KCNN3 and 
      NCOA3) in humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. The study showed a 
      general conservation of the repetitive tract and of the polymorphism in the four 
      species and high heterogeneity among loci distributions. Humans present slightly 
      larger alleles than the rest of species but a more relevant difference appears in 
      variability levels: Humans are the species with the largest variance, although 
      only for the expanding loci, suggesting a relationship between variability levels 
      and expansion potential. The sequence analysis shows high levels of sequence 
      conservation among species, a lack of correspondence between interruption 
      patterns and variability levels, and signs of conservative selective pressure for 
      some of the STR loci. Only two loci (SCA1 and SCA8) show a human specific 
      distribution, with larger alleles than the rest of species. This could account, 
      at the same time, for a human-specific trait and a predisposition to disease 
      through expansion.

TI  - Molecular architecture of CAG repeats in human disease related transcripts.
PG  - 665-79
AB  - CAG repeats are present in numerous human transcripts but neither their 
      structures nor physiological functions have been satisfactorily recognized. The 
      expanded CAG repeats are present in transcripts from several mutant genes 
      associated with hereditary neurodegenerative diseases but their contribution to 
      pathogenesis has not been documented convincingly. Here, we show that the 
      structures formed by the repeats and their natural flanking sequences in the 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 3 and type 6, and dentatorubral-palidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA) transcripts have different molecular architectures which may have 
      functional meaning. We provide evidence that the hairpin structure formed by CAG 
      repeats in mRNA fragments is preserved in full-length mRNA. We also demonstrate 
      that the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that is located immediately 
      adjacent (3') to the repeats of the SCA3 transcript modulates the structures 
      formed by these sequences, and may have functional significance, as only one of 
      its variants is selected in human evolution.

TI  - Molecular genetics of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia: mutation analysis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia genes and CAG/CTG repeat expansion detection in 225 
      Italian families.
PG  - 727-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, at present 
      associated with 22 loci (spinocerebellar ataxia [SCA] 1-SCA8, SCA10-SCA19, SCA21, 
      SCA22, fibroblast growth factor 14 [FGF14]-SCA, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy [DRPLA]). The relevant gene has been identified in 12 cases (SCA1-3, 
      SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, FGF14, and DRPLA), and in all but the recently identified 
      SCA14, SCA17, PRKCG and FGF14 genes, the defect consists of the expansion of a 
      short nucleotide repeat. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relative prevalence of 
      SCA1-3, SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, and SCA17 gene expansions in Italian families with 
      hereditary ataxia, specifically to verify the occurrence of SCA10, SCA12, and 
      SCA17 in Italy; and to analyze samples from probands with negative test results 
      at the initial screening by means of the repeat expansion detection technique to 
      identify CAG/CTG expansions in novel loci.Patients Two hundred twenty-five 
      unrelated Italian index cases with hereditary ataxia, most (n = 183) of whom 
      presented with a clear dominantly transmitted trait. RESULTS: We found that SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene mutations accounted for most cases (21% and 24%, respectively). We 
      found SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, and SCA17 to be very rare (approximately 1% each), 
      and no case of SCA10 or SCA12 was identified. Half of the index cases (113/225) 
      were negative for expansions in the known SCA genes. Repeat expansion detection 
      analysis performed on 111 of these cases showed a CAG/CTG repeat expansion of at 
      least 50 triplets in 22 (20%). Twenty-one of 22 expansions could be attributed to 
      length variation at 2 polymorphic loci (expanded repeat domain CAG/CTG 1 [ERDA1] 
      or CTG repeat on chromosome 18q21.1 [CTG18.1]). In 1 patient, the expansion was 
      assigned to the DRPLA gene. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of SCA1-3 and SCA6-7 
      gene mutations is peculiar in Italy. We found a relatively high frequency of SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene expansions; SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 mutations were rare, compared with 
      other European countries. No SCA10 or SCA12 and only a few SCA8 (2/225) and SCA17 
      (2/225) families were detected. In patients negative for defects in known SCA 
      genes, repeat expansion detection data strongly suggest that, at least in our 
      population, CAG/CTG expansions in novel genes should be considered an unlikely 
      cause of the SCA phenotype.

TI  - Genetic testing in spinocerebellar ataxia in Taiwan: expansions of trinucleotide 
      repeats in SCA8 and SCA17 are associated with typical Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 209-14
AB  - DNA tests in normal subjects and patients with ataxia and Parkinson's disease 
      (PD) were carried out to assess the frequency of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) and 
      to document the distribution of SCA mutations underlying ethnic Chinese in 
      Taiwan. MJD/SCA3 (46%) was the most common autosomal dominant SCA in the 
      Taiwanese cohort, followed by SCA6 (18%) and SCA1 (3%). No expansions of SCA 
      types 2, 10, 12, or dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) were detected. The 
      clinical phenotypes of these affected SCA patients were very heterogeneous. All 
      of them showed clinical symptoms of cerebellar ataxia, with or without other 
      associated features. The frequencies of large normal alleles are closely 
      associated with the prevalence of SCA1, SCA2, MJD/SCA3, SCA6, and DRPLA among 
      Taiwanese, Japanese, and Caucasians. Interestingly, abnormal expansions of SCA8 
      and SCA17 genes were detected in patients with PD. The clinical presentation for 
      these patients is typical of idiopathic PD with the following characteristics: 
      late onset of disease, resting tremor in the limbs, rigidity, bradykinesia, and a 
      good response to levodopa. This study appears to be the first report describing 
      the PD phenotype in association with an expanded allele in the TATA-binding 
      protein gene and suggests that SCA8 may also be a cause of typical PD.

TI  - Prevalence of dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy in a large series of white 
      patients with cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 1097-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a rare 
      neurodegenerative disorder mainly diagnosed in Japan. Its prevalence is low in 
      other countries. Three phenotypes are described: choreoathetoid movements, 
      cerebellar ataxia, and progressive myoclonic epilepsy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 
      frequency of DRPLA in European patients with sporadic or autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia. METHODS: We analyzed a series of 809 index patients with 
      either autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (416 families) or progressive 
      cerebellar ataxia without a family history of the disease (393 cases) for the 
      DRPLA mutation. RESULTS: We identified a CAG repeat expansion in the DRPLA gene 
      in one family and in one patient without a family history. The familial case 
      illustrates the phenomenon of anticipation and the previously established 
      correlation between the phenotype and size of the expansion. A censored-history 
      family or expansion of large normal CAG repeats during paternal transmission 
      could be implicated in the patient without a family history. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study enables us to estimate the frequency of the disease as 0.25% in both 
      families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia and sporadic cases of ataxia 
      in our series, confirming the very low frequency of DRPLA in Europe. In both 
      familial and sporadic cases, molecular testing for DRPLA could be restricted to 
      patients with ataxia with one of the following features: chorea, dementia, or 
      myoclonic epilepsy.

TI  - Huntington's disease-like phenotype due to trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 
      TBP and JPH3 genes.
PG  - 1599-603
AB  - We report a group of 252 patients with a Huntington's disease-like (HDL) 
      phenotype, including 60 with typical Huntington's disease, who had tested 
      negative for pathological expansions in the IT15 gene, the major mutation in 
      Huntington's disease. They were screened for repeat expansions in two other genes 
      involved in HDL phenotypes: those encoding the junctophilin-3 (JPH3/HDL2) and 
      prion (PRNP/HDL1) proteins. In addition, because of the clinical overlap between 
      patients with HDL disease and autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia or 
      dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), we investigated trinucleotide 
      repeat expansions in genes encoding the TATA-binding protein (TBP/SCA17) and 
      atrophin-1 (DRPLA). Two patients carried 43 and 50 uninterrupted CTG repeats in 
      the JPH3 gene. Two other patients had 44 and 46 CAA/CAG repeats in the TBP gene. 
      Patients with expansions in the TBP or JPH3 genes had HDL phenotypes 
      indistinguishable from Huntington's disease. Taking into account patients with 
      typical Huntington's disease, their frequencies were evaluated as 3% each in our 
      series of typical HDL patients. Interestingly, incomplete penetrance of the 46 
      CAA/CAG repeat in the TBP gene was observed in a 59-year-old transmitting, but 
      healthy, parent. Furthermore, we report a new configuration of the expanded TBP 
      allele, with 11 repeats on the first polymorphic stretch of CAGs. Expansions in 
      the DRPLA gene and insertions in the PRNP gene were not found in our group of 
      patients. Further genetic heterogeneity of the HDL phenotype therefore exists.

TI  - A novel autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA22) linked to chromosome 
      1p21-q23.
PG  - 1293-9
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically, pathologically 
      and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. Ten responsible genes have been 
      identified for spinocerebellar ataxia types SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, 
      SCA10, SCA12 and SCA17, and dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      mutation is caused by an expansion of a CAG, CTG or ATTCT repeat sequence of 
      these genes. Six additional loci, SCA4, SCA5, SCA11, SCA13, SCA14 and SCA16 have 
      also been mapped. The growing heterogeneity of the autosomal dominant forms of 
      these diseases shows that the genetic aetiologies of at least 20% of ADCA have 
      yet to be elucidated. We ascertained and clinically characterized a 
      four-generation Chinese pedigree segregating an autosomal dominant phenotype for 
      cerebellar ataxia. Direct mutation analysis, linkage analysis for all known SCA 
      loci and a genome-wide linkage study were performed. Direct mutation analysis 
      excluded SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17 and DRPLA, and genetic linkage analysis 
      excluded SCA4, 5, 11, 13, 14 and 16. The genome-wide linkage study suggested 
      linkage to a locus on chromosome 1p21-q23, with the highest two-point LOD score 
      at D1S1167 (Zmax = 3.46 at theta = 0.00). Multipoint analysis and haplotype 
      reconstruction traced this novel SCA locus (SCA22) to a 43.7-cM interval flanked 
      by D1S206 and D1S2878 (Zmax = 3.78 under four liability classes, and 2.67 using 
      affected-only method). The age at onset ranged from 10 to 46 years. All affected 
      members had gait ataxia with variable features of dysarthria and hyporeflexia. 
      Head MRI showed homogeneous atrophy of the cerebellum without involvement of the 
      brainstem. In six parent-child pairs, median onset occurred 10 years earlier in 
      offspring than in their parents, suggesting anticipation. This family is distinct 
      from other families with SCA and is characterized by a slowly progressive, pure 
      cerebellar ataxia.

TI  - Searching for modulating effects of SCA2, SCA6 and DRPLA CAG tracts on the 
      Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3) phenotype.
PG  - 211-4
AB  - CONTEXT: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD/SCA3) is an autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia of adult onset. The variability in age at onset and the complex and 
      heterogeneous neurologic findings indicate that MJD, caused by a major gene, is 
      modulated by modifier factors. OBJECTIVE: To study if the polymorphic CAG repeats 
      at other loci (namely, SCA2, SCA6 and DRPLA) thus acted as modifier factors of 
      this disease. DESIGN: Case-control. SETTING: Ambulatory care in a referral 
      center. PATIENTS: A convenience sample of 39 unrelated, Brazilian patients with 
      MJD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: age of onset, anticipation, clinical subtypes and 
      neurological findings. RESULTS: Fasciculations were associated with CAG repeat 
      length of the long SCA2 allele (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.03, after Bonferroni 
      procedure). Other measures (age of onset, anticipation, clinical types and other 
      neurological signs) were not associated with CAG repeat length of SCA2, SCA6 and 
      DRPLA genes. CONCLUSIONS: The present results show that the CAG tract of SCA2 
      gene interferes with MJD phenotype. Further studies, with patients of other 
      origins and with typing of other (CAG)n loci, are necessary.

TI  - Paradoxical absence of nuclear inclusion in cerebellar Purkinje cells of 
      hereditary ataxias linked to CAG expansion.
PG  - 450-2
AB  - Degeneration of cerebellar cortex is one of the principal features of hereditary 
      ataxias linked to expansion of CAG repeat. In an attempt to clarify possible 
      correlation between neuronal depletion and neuronal intranuclear inclusions, both 
      triggered by the pathological expansion of CAG repeat, cerebellar sections from 
      SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and DRPLA cases were immunostained with anti-ubiquitin or 
      anti-expanded polyglutamine antibody (1C2) and were screened for the presence of 
      neuronal intranuclear inclusions. Although the degree of cerebellar degeneration 
      varied greatly, cerebellar Purkinje cells were uniformly characterised by the 
      absence of neuronal intranuclear inclusion. Complete absence of neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusion in Purkinje cells is apparently paradoxical and hardly 
      explained if neuronal intranuclear inclusion formation is positively correlated 
      to a mechanism accelerating neuronal death. It may, otherwise, suggest an 
      intrinsic link between neuronal intranuclear inclusion formation and 
      neurodegeneration in opposite directions in human Purkinje cells, more or less 
      affected in these CAG repeat disorders.

TI  - Increased (CTG/CAG)(n) lengths in myotonic dystrophy type 1 and Machado-Joseph 
      disease genes in idiopathic azoospermia patients.
PG  - 1578-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increase in CAG trinucleotide repeat length in the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene has been linked to idiopathic azoospermia. METHODS: In order 
      to test whether other (CAG/CTG)(n) loci are also affected, the (CAG/CTG)(n) 
      frequency distribution at myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), Machado-Joseph disease 
      (MJD), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 8 (SCA8) loci, in addition to the AR gene, was investigated in 48 
      azoospermia patients and 47 controls. RESULTS: The median CAG repeat length in 
      the AR gene was significantly longer in azoospermia patients than in controls (23 
      versus 21, P < 0.001). Significant differences were also noted in the upper tails 
      of trinucleotide repeat length distributions at both DM1 and MJD loci between the 
      two populations. At the DM1 locus, alleles of more than 18 repeats were observed 
      only in azoospermia patients, and not in controls (P = 0.014). At the MJD locus, 
      the frequency of normal alleles (ANs) with 29 or more CAG repeats was also much 
      higher in azoospermia patients (29.2 versus 7.4%; P = 0.0001). However, the 
      repeat length distribution at DRPLA and SCA8 loci did not differ in the two 
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicated that, at least in a subset of 
      azoospermia patients, there was an increase in the number of trinucleotide 
      repeats in some disease loci. Thus, it is noteworthy to evaluate whether 
      offspring of these azoospermia patients, if born by assisted reproductive 
      technologies, have an increased risk of trinucleotide repeat diseases.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeats in 202 families with ataxia: a small expanded (CAG)n allele 
      at the SCA17 locus.
PG  - 623-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ten neurodegenerative disorders characterized by spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) are known to be caused by trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansions. 
      However, in some instances the molecular diagnosis is considered indeterminate 
      because of the overlap between normal and affected allele ranges. In addition, 
      the mechanism that generates expanded alleles is not completely understood. 
      OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical and molecular characteristics of a large group 
      of Portuguese and Brazilian families with ataxia to improve knowledge of the 
      molecular diagnosis of SCA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have (1) assessed repeat 
      sizes at all known TNR loci implicated in SCA; (2) determined frequency 
      distributions of normal alleles and expansions; and (3) looked at 
      genotype-phenotype correlations in 202 unrelated Portuguese and Brazilian 
      patients with SCA. Molecular analysis of TNR expansions was performed using 
      polymerase chain reaction amplification. RESULTS: Patients from 110 unrelated 
      families with SCA showed TNR expansions at 1 of the loci studied. Dominantly 
      transmitted cases had (CAG)(n) expansions at the Machado-Joseph disease gene 
      (MJD1) (63%), at SCA2 (3%), the gene for dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) (2%), SCA6 (1%), or SCA7 (1%) loci, or (CTG)(n) expansions at the SCA8 
      (2%) gene, whereas (GAA)(n) expansions in the Freidreich ataxia gene (FRDA) were 
      found in 64% of families with recessive ataxia. Isolated patients also had TNR 
      expansions at the MJD1 (6%), SCA8 (6%), or FRDA (8%) genes; in addition, an 
      expanded allele at the TATA-binding protein gene (TBP), with 43 CAGs, was present 
      in a patient with ataxia and mental deterioration. Associations between 
      frequencies of SCA2 and SCA6 and a frequency of large normal alleles were found 
      in Portuguese and Brazilian individuals, respectively. Interestingly, no 
      association between the frequencies of DRPLA and large normal alleles was found 
      in the Portuguese group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that (1) a significant 
      number of isolated cases of ataxia are due to TNR expansions; (2) expanded DRPLA 
      alleles in Portuguese families may have evolved from an ancestral haplotype; and 
      (3) small (CAG)(n) expansions at the TBP gene may cause SCA17.

TI  - Is the 31 CAG repeat allele of the spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) gene locus 
      non-specifically associated with trinucleotide expansion diseases?
PG  - 201-5
AB  - A number of human hereditary neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders are 
      caused by the expansion of trinucleotide repeats within certain genes. The 
      molecular mechanisms that underlie these expansions are not yet known. We have 
      analyzed six trinucleotide repeat-containing loci [spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, 
      SCA3, SCA8), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), Huntington chorea (HD) 
      and fragile X syndrome (FRAXA)] in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients (n = 
      52). As controls, we analyzed two groups of subjects: healthy control subjects (n 
      =133), and a group of patients with non-triplet neuromuscular diseases (n = 68) 
      caused by point mutations, deletions or duplications (spinal muscular atrophy, 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 1A, hereditary neuropathy with liability to 
      pressure palsies, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy). Allele frequency 
      distributions for all tested loci were similar in these three groups with the 
      exception of the SCA1 locus. In DM1 patients, the SCA1 allele with 31 CAG repeats 
      account for 40.4% of all chromosomes tested, which is significantly higher than 
      in two other groups (11.3% in healthy controls and 6.6% in the group of 
      non-triplet diseased patients; P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). This is 
      consistent with our previous findings in HD patients. The absence of this 
      association in non-triplet diseases as well as in healthy controls could indicate 
      a possible role of this SCA1 allele with 31 repeats in triplet diseases. Here we 
      discuss a possible role of the SCA1 region in pathological trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions.

TI  - Amino acid sequences flanking polyglutamine stretches influence their potential 
      for aggregate formation.
PG  - 3357-64
AB  - Expanded polyglutamine stretches have been shown to form aggregates and to be 
      toxic to cells. In this study, we hypothesized that amino acid sequences flanking 
      the polyglutamine stretches influence the aggregate formation potential of these 
      stretches. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins containing glutamine 
      repeats of various lengths and a fixed number of flanking amino acids of 
      ataxin-2, huntingtin, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy protein (DRPLAP) or 
      ataxin-3 were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. The aggregate formation 
      potential of ataxin-2 and DRPLAP increased in a CAG-repeat-length-dependent 
      manner, with a threshold between 34 and 36. Truncated ataxin-2-Q56-GFP and 
      truncated huntingtin-Q56-GFP showed a significantly higher aggregate formation 
      potential than truncated DRPLAP-Q56-GFP or truncated ataxin-3-Q56-GFP. These 
      results are in agreement with the clinical observation that ages of disease onset 
      in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 or Huntington's disease are lower 
      than those in patients with DRPLA or Machado-Joseph disease having expanded CAG 
      repeats of the same length. Furthermore, mutagenesis of the flanking sequence of 
      ataxin-2 markedly reduced its aggregate formation potential. These results 
      indicate that the amino acid sequences flanking the polyglutamine stretches 
      significantly influence their aggregate formation potential.

TI  - Dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy in Chinese.
PG  - 1905-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a rare, autosomal 
      dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by a range of clinical 
      manifestations, including cerebellar ataxia, epilepsy, myoclonus, 
      choreoathetosis, and dementia. Outside the Japanese population, the prevalence is 
      extremely low worldwide. The reason for different ethnic prevalences of DRPLA is 
      unclear. A previous assumption was that large normal alleles contribute to 
      generation of expanded alleles and the relative frequencies of DRPLA. OBJECTIVES: 
      To describe the clinical, radiological, and genetic features of the first 
      reported Chinese family with DRPLA, to our knowledge, and to compare the size 
      distribution of normal alleles at the DRPLA locus in healthy Chinese individuals 
      with that of other ethnic groups. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 80 Chinese kindreds 
      with autosomally dominant spinocerebellar ataxias, 1 pedigree with 2 affected 
      patients was found by polymerase chain reaction to carry the characteristic DRPLA 
      mutation. The allele frequencies of different CAG repeat lengths at the DRPLA 
      locus in 225 healthy Chinese individuals were also analyzed and compared with 
      Japanese, white, and African American distributions. RESULTS: The clinical 
      presentations of the 2 Chinese patients affected with DRPLA are similar to those 
      described in Japanese patients, except that the affected father exhibited 
      myoclonus but not chorea. Although the normal DRPLA allele size is distributed 
      similarly in Chinese and Japanese populations, DRPLA in Chinese individuals is 
      rare. Thus far, to our knowledge, only 1 intermediate-sized allele containing 
      more than 30 CAG repeats has been reported among healthy Chinese individuals, in 
      contrast to 3 among Japanese populations. CONCLUSION: The ethnic prevalence of 
      DRPLA seems to be correlated with the prevalence of intermediate-sized alleles in 
      individual populations.

TI  - Neuronal nuclear alterations in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy: 
      ultrastructural and morphometric studies of the cerebellar granule cells.
PG  - 12-9
AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion, resulting in 
      ubiquitinated inclusions and diffuse accumulation of mutant atrophin-1 in the 
      neuronal nuclei in many regions of the central nervous system. In the cerebellar 
      cortex, such nuclear abnormalities occur in the granule cells. In the present 
      study, we performed ultrastructural and morphometric analyses on the nuclei of 
      the cerebellar granule cells from eight patients with DRPLA (four with 
      juvenile-onset disease and four with adult-onset disease) in an attempt to obtain 
      further insight into the neuronal nuclear alterations that occur in CAG-repeat 
      diseases. Ultrastructurally, all patients had intranuclear filamentous inclusions 
      (NIIs, neuronal intranuclear inclusions) and nuclear membrane indentations (NMIs) 
      in some of their granule cells, and chromatin tended to be sparse in the 
      nucleoplasm of the affected nuclei. No such changes were observed in the granule 
      cells of four control subjects. In all patients there was an association between 
      NIIs and NMIs, and nuclei with NIIs and/or NMIs were larger than those without 
      such changes. However, the nuclear enlargement was not due solely to the NIIs - 
      even nuclei without NIIs or NMIs were larger in the patients than in the 
      controls. In the DRPLA patients, there was a significant inverse correlation 
      between the cross-sectional area of the nuclei and the disease duration. These 
      findings indicate that NIIs and NMIs are features in the disease and occur in 
      association with each other, and that nuclear enlargement - the degree of which 
      may decrease with time after onset of the illness - is a more prevalent 
      abnormality than the formation of NIIs or NMIs.

TI  - Single cell analysis of CAG repeat in brains of dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA).
PG  - 87-93
AB  - Somatic mosaicism of an expanded repeat is present in tissues of patients with 
      triplet repeat diseases. Of the spinocerebellar ataxias associated with triplet 
      repeat expansion, the most prominent heterogeneity of the expanded repeat is seen 
      in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The common feature of this 
      somatic mosaicism is the difference in the repeat numbers found in the cerebellum 
      as compared to other tissues. The expanded allele in the cerebellum shows a 
      smaller degree of expansion. We previously showed by microdissection analysis 
      that the expanded allele in the granular layer in DRPLA cerebellum has less 
      expansion than expanded alleles in the molecular layer and white matter. Whether 
      this feature of lesser expansion in granule cells is common to other types of 
      neurons is yet to be clarified. We used a newly developed excimer laser 
      microdissection system to analyze somatic mosaicism in the brains of two 
      patients, one with early- and another with late-onset DRPLA, and used single cell 
      PCR to observe the cell-to-cell differences in repeat numbers. In the late onset 
      patient, repeat expansion was more prominent in Purkinje cells than in granule 
      cells, but less than that in the glial cells. In the early onset patient, repeat 
      expansion in Purkinje cells was greater than in granule cells but did not differ 
      from that in glial cells. These findings suggest that there is a difference in 
      repeat expansion among neuronal subgroups and that the number of cell division 
      cycles is not the only determinant of somatic mosaicism.

TI  - Widespread occurrence of intranuclear atrophin-1 accumulation in the central 
      nervous system neurons of patients with dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy.
PG  - 14-23
AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion. In the present study 
      of DRPLA, we have demonstrated immunohistochemically that diffuse accumulation of 
      mutant atrophin-1 in the neuronal nuclei, rather than the formation of neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusions (NIIs), was the predominant pathologic condition and 
      involved a wide range of central nervous system regions far beyond the systems 
      previously reported to be affected. In the neuronal nuclei harboring NIIs, 
      promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies were redistributed into a 
      single NII, and the CREB (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein)-binding 
      protein was also recruited into NIIs. The results suggest that the novel lesion 
      distribution revealed by the diffuse nuclear labeling may be responsible for a 
      variety of clinical features, such as dementia and epilepsy in DRPLA, and that 
      certain transcriptional abnormalities may be induced secondarily in neuronal 
      nuclei with the formation of NIIs.

TI  - Analysis of CAG repeats in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia patients and distribution of CAG repeats at the SCA1, SCA2 
      and SCA6 loci in nine ethnic populations of eastern India.
PG  - 597-604
AB  - To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 57 unrelated 
      individuals clinically diagnosed as ataxia patients we analysed the SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci for expansion of CAG repeats. We detected CAG 
      repeat expansion in 6 patients (10.5%) at the SCA1 locus. Ten of the 57 patients 
      (17.5%) had CAG repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while four had CAG expansion 
      at the SCA3/MJD locus (7%). At the SCA6 locus there was a single patient (1.8%) 
      with 21 CAG repeats. We have not detected any patient with expansion in the SCA7 
      and DRPLA loci. To test whether the frequencies of the large normal alleles in 
      SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6 loci can reflect some light on prevalence of the subtypes of 
      SCAs we studied the CAG repeat variation in these loci in nine ethnic 
      sub-populations of eastern India from which the patients originated. We report 
      here that the frequency of large normal alleles (>31 CAG repeats) in SCA1 locus 
      to be 0.211 of 394 chromosomes studied. We also report that the frequency of 
      large normal alleles (>22 CAG repeats) at the SCA2 locus is 0.038 while at the 
      SCA6 locus frequency of large normal alleles (>13 repeats) is 0.032. We discussed 
      our data in light of the distribution of normal alleles and prevalence of SCAs in 
      the Japanese and white populations.

AB  - Two hundred and forty-eight patients from 116 Italian families with dominant 
      ataxia were studied for CAG expansion within SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 (spinocerebellar 
      ataxia) and DRPLA (dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy) genes. Fifty-six percent 
      of the families originated from Southern, 19% from Central and 25% from Northern 
      Italy. SCA2 was the commonest mutation, accounting for 47% of the families, 
      followed by SCA1 (24%), SCA6 (2%), SCA7 (2%) and DRPLA (1%). No SCA3 family was 
      found. Twenty-four percent of the families carried a still unidentified mutation. 
      When occurrence of mutations was evaluated according to the geographic origin, 
      SCA1 was the commonest in Northern (72%), whereas SCA2 was prevalent (63%) in 
      Southern Italy. The number of CAG repeats in SCA1 normal alleles was higher in 
      Northern than in Central-Southern Italy.

TI  - Protein binding of a DRPLA family through arginine-glutamic acid dipeptide 
      repeats is enhanced by extended polyglutamine.
PG  - 1433-42
AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is one of the hereditary 
      neurodegenerative disorders caused by expansion of CAG/glutamine repeats. To 
      investigate the normal function of the DRPLA gene and the pathogenic mechanism of 
      neuron death in specific areas of the brain, we isolated and analyzed a gene that 
      shares a notable motif with DRPLA, arginine-glutamic acid (RE) dipeptide repeats. 
      The gene isolated, designated RERE, has an open reading frame of 1566 amino 
      acids, of which the C-terminal portion has 67% homology to DRPLA, whereas the 
      N-terminal portion is distinctive. RERE also contains arginine-aspartic acid (RD) 
      dipeptide repeats and putative nuclear localization signal sequences, but no 
      polyglutamine tracts. RERE is expressed at a low level in most tissues examined. 
      Immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays demonstrate that the DRPLA and 
      RERE proteins bind each other, for which one of the RE repeats has a primary 
      role, and extended polyglutamine enhances the binding. With engineered constructs 
      fused with a tag, the RERE protein localized predominantly in the nucleus. 
      Moreover, when RERE is overexpressed, the distribution of endogenous DRPLA 
      protein alters from the diffused to the speckled pattern in the nucleus so as to 
      co-localize with RERE. More RERE protein is recruited into nuclear aggregates of 
      the DRPLA protein with extended polyglutamine than into those of pure 
      polyglutamine. These results reveal a function for the DRPLA protein in the 
      nucleus and the RE repeat in the protein-protein interaction.

TI  - Frequency of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, and DRPLA CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in patients with hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia from Chinese 
      kindreds.
PG  - 540-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of SCA1 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 1), SCA2, 
      SCA3/MJD (spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, and 
      DRPLA (dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy) CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions 
      [(CAG)n] among persons diagnosed with hereditary SCA from Chinese families. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, 
      and DRPLA (CAG)n mutation were detected with the polymerase chain reaction, 
      highly denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and silver staining 
      technique in 167 patients with autosomal dominant SCA from 85 Chinese families 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA. RESULTS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (CAG)n 
      mutation in 7 patients from 4 kindreds (4.70%) was expanded to 53 to 62 repeats. 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (CAG)n mutation in 12 patients from 5 kindreds 
      (5.88%) was expanded to 42 to 47 repeats. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3/Machado-Joseph disease (CAG)n mutation in 83 patients from 41 kindreds (48.23%) 
      was expanded to 68 to 83 repeats. Sixty-five patients from 35 kindreds (41.19%) 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA did not test positive for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, 
      SCA6, SCA7, or DRPLA. There was a predictable inverse relationship between the 
      number of CAG repeats and the age at onset for SCA3/MJD and SCA2. Clinically, 
      dementia and hyporeflexia were more frequent in patients with SCA2, while 
      spasticity, hyperreflexia, and Babinski signs were more frequent in patients with 
      SCA3/ MJD, and those might be helpful in clinical work to primarily distinguish 
      patients with SCA3/MJD and SCA2 from others with different types of SCA. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of SCA3/MJD is substantially higher than that of SCA1 
      and SCA2 in patients with autosomal dominant SCA from Chinese kindreds, who are 
      non-Portuguese. Clinical expressions of the various types of SCAs overlap one 
      another; therefore, for clinical study it is important to make a gene diagnosis 
      and genetic classification for patients with SCA.

TI  - Absence of unidentified CAG repeat expansion in patients with Huntington's 
      disease-like phenotype.
PG  - 672-5
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by an expanded (CAG)n repeat on the huntingtin gene. It is characterised 
      by motor, psychiatric and cognitive disturbances. Diagnosis can be confirmed by 
      direct genetic testing, which is highly sensitive and specific and is now 
      considered definitive. This study focused on 21 patients presenting with a 
      clinical phenotype showing strong similarity to HD, but who do not have an 
      expanded CAG in the huntingtin gene. However, other possible diagnoses could be 
      evoked for most of them. Seven patients (3.5% of our cohort) could be considered 
      as phenocopies of HD with no alternative diagnosis. Samples were screened for 
      other triplet repeat diseases with similar presentation (DRPLA, SCA-1, SCA-2, 
      SCA-3, SCA-6, and SCA-7) and were all negative. The repeat expansion detection 
      technique (RED) was used to detect uncloned CAG repeat expansions and samples 
      were also analysed by polymerase chain reaction for expansions of the polymorphic 
      CAG-ERDA-1 and CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeats. RED expansion (>40 repeats) was 
      detected in only one patient. The results suggest that unstable CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions corresponding to known or unknown sequences are not involved in the 
      aetiology of HD-like disorders. It is hypothesised that some of these phenocopies 
      could correspond to mutations in other unidentified genes with other unstable 
      repeats (different from CAG) or in unknown genes with other mutations.

TI  - Nuclear accumulation of truncated atrophin-1 fragments in a transgenic mouse 
      model of DRPLA.
PG  - 275-86
AB  - Dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a member of a family of 
      progressive neurodegenerative diseases caused by polyglutamine repeat expansion. 
      Transgenic mice expressing full-length human atrophin-1 with 65 consecutive 
      glutamines exhibit ataxia, tremors, abnormal movements, seizures, and premature 
      death. These mice accumulate atrophin-1 immunoreactivity and inclusion bodies in 
      the nuclei of multiple populations of neurons. Subcellular fractionation revealed 
      120 kDa nuclear fragments of mutant atrophin-1, whose abundance increased with 
      age and phenotypic severity. Brains of DRPLA patients contained apparently 
      identical 120 kDa nuclear fragments. By contrast, mice overexpressing atrophin-1 
      with 26 glutamines were phenotypically normal and did not accumulate the 120 kDa 
      fragments. We conclude that the evolution of neuropathology in DRPLA involves 
      proteolytic processing of mutant atrophin-1 and nuclear accumulation of truncated 
      fragments.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat polymorphism at five disease loci in mixed Hungarian 
      population.
PG  - 245-50
AB  - In apparently healthy, unrelated Hungarians we examined triplet repeat length 
      polymorphism at Huntington disease (HD), spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy 
      (SBMA), spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA-1), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA), and myotonic dystrophy (MD) loci. The distribution of alleles of 
      the SCA-1 locus was markedly different compared with Asians and Caucasian samples 
      examined by Watkins WS, Bamshad M, and Jorde LB [1995: Hum Mol Genet 
      4:1485-1491]. The unimodal distribution of peaks was shifted towards the shorter 
      repeats on the average with 4-5 repeats. Alleles under 21 repeats at the SBMA 
      locus were significantly less frequent in Hungarians than in Asians and 
      Caucasians. We also found significant difference in the distribution of DRPLA 
      allele size at repeat length over 15 repeats; these alleles were less frequent in 
      Hungarians compared with Asians and Caucasians. No significant differences were 
      found in alleles at the MD and also at the HD loci compared with the other 
      groups. These findings suggest that these trinucleotide sites in combination with 
      other markers are particularly useful for determination of the genetic origin of 
      a population, if they can be compared with similar subset of data of other 
      populations. The present results could not confirm the large genetic distance 
      between Hungarian and Oriental races and the relatively short distance between 
      Hungarian and other European populations suggested in earlier reports [Czeizel A, 
      Benkmann H-G, Goedde HW, editors. 1991: Genetics of the Hungarian population. 
      Budapest: Akademiai Kiado. p 82-334].

TI  - Differences in evoked potential characteristics between DRPLA patients and 
      patients with progressive myoclonic epilepsy: preliminary findings indicating 
      usefulness for differential diagnosis.
PG  - 3-11
AB  - The characteristics of evoked potentials in patients with 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) were investigated. Twelve patients 
      with DRPLA and three patients with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) 
      attributable to other causes participated in the study. In 11 out of the 12 
      patients, the diagnosis of DRPLA was genetically confirmed, based on a 56-75 CAG 
      triplet repeat expansion on chromosome 12p; in the remaining patient, the 
      diagnosis was not genetically confirmed but the patient was clinically diagnosed 
      as having DRPLA and was within the same pedigree as one of the 11 genetically 
      confirmed patients. Two out of the three patients with PME, who had been tested 
      for dodecamer repeat expansion in the cystatin B gene, were genetically confirmed 
      as having Unverricht-Lundborg disease (UL); the remaining patient was also 
      clinically diagnosed as having UL, but the patient did not have the 
      aforementioned genetic abnormality. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and 
      brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAERs) were recorded. The amplitudes of the 
      SEPs were determined as the peak-to-peak amplitudes between P2 and N2 
      deflections. The results revealed that high-amplitude SEPs were not evoked in any 
      of the DRPLA patients; on the other hand, high-amplitude SEPs were evoked in all 
      the patients with UL. Moreover, BAERs were absent in seven out of the 12 patients 
      with DRPLA; on the other hand, all UL patients showed BAERs in which all peaks, 
      from I to V, were distinguishable. These results suggest differences in 
      pathophysiology between DRPLA, which predominantly affects the brainstem and 
      subcortical regions, and PME, characterized by cortical hyperexcitability. Thus, 
      evoked potential measurements may be useful to differentiate DRPLA patients from 
      those with progressive myoclonic epilepsy.

TI  - Tissue-specific somatic mosaicism in spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy is 
      dependent on CAG-repeat length and androgen receptor--gene expression level.
PG  - 966-73
AB  - The factors influencing the tissue-specific pattern of somatic mosaicism in 
      CAG-repeat diseases have not yet been fully resolved. We performed a detailed 
      analysis of the degree of somatic mosaicism in various tissues from 20 patients 
      with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), including 4 who were deceased. 
      The most outstanding feature was the prominent somatic mosaicism observed in the 
      cardiac and skeletal muscles, composed predominantly of postmitotic cells, and in 
      the skin, prostate, and testis. The CNS tissues, liver, and spleen showed the 
      least mosaicism. The tissue distribution of somatic mosaicism in patients with 
      SBMA was markedly different from that in patients with Huntington disease (HD) 
      and from that in patients with dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      degree of somatic mosaicism correlated with the CAG-repeat number but not with 
      age at examination. Furthermore, tissues with a higher mosaicism level 
      corresponded well to those with a higher expression level of androgen receptor 
      protein. The tissue-specific pattern of somatic mosaicism related not only to 
      cell composition with different cell turnover rates but to repeat size and gene 
      expression levels, and postnatal cell division is unlikely to be a major cause of 
      somatic mosaicism probably because of the relative stability of CAG repeat in 
      SBMA.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias in Spanish patients: genetic analysis of familial and 
      sporadic cases. The Ataxia Study Group.
PG  - 516-22
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically heterogeneous group 
      of neurodegenerative disorders caused by unstable CAG repeat expansions encoding 
      polyglutamine tracts. Five spinocerebellar ataxia genes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 
      and SCA7) and another related dominant ataxia gene (DRPLA) have been cloned, 
      allowing the genetic classification of these disorders. We present here the 
      molecular analysis of 87 unrelated familial and 60 sporadic Spanish cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia. For ADCA cases 15% were SCA2, 15% SCA3, 6% SCA1, 3% SCA7, 
      1% SCA6 and 1% DRPLA, an extremely rare mutation in Caucasoid populations. About 
      58% of ADCA cases remained genetically unclassified. All the SCA1 cases belong to 
      the same geographical area and share a common haplotype for the SCA1 mutation. 
      The expanded alleles ranged from 41 to 59 repeats for SCA1, 35 to 46 [corrected] 
      for SCA2, 67 to 77 for SCA3, and 38 to 113 for SCA7. One SCA6 case had 25 repeats 
      and one DRPLA case had 63 repeats. The highest CAG repeat variation in meiotic 
      transmission of expanded alleles was detected in SCA7, this being of +67 units in 
      one paternal transmission and giving rise to a 113 CAG repeat allele in a patient 
      who died at 3 years of age. Meiotic transmissions have also shown a tendency to 
      more frequent paternal transmission of expanded alleles in SCA1 and maternal in 
      SCA7. All SCA1 and SCA2 expanded alleles analyzed consisted of pure CAG repeats, 
      whereas normal alleles were interrupted by 1-2 CAT trinucleotides in SCA1, except 
      for three alleles of 6, 14 and 21 CAG repeats, and by 1-3 CAA trinucleotides in 
      SCA2. No SCA or DRPLA mutations were detected in the 60 sporadic cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia, but one late onset patient was identified as a recessive 
      form due to GAA-repeat expansions in the Friedreich's ataxia gene.

TI  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy protein interacts through a proline-rich 
      region near polyglutamine with the SH3 domain of an insulin receptor tyrosine 
      kinase substrate.
PG  - 947-57
AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant neuro 
      degrees enerative disorder associated with CAG/glutamine repeat expansion. While 
      the DRPLA gene is ubiquitously expressed, neuron death occurs in specific 
      anatomical areas of the brain. This predicts that the DRPLA protein interacts 
      with other proteins and that these interactions may play a role in pathogenesis. 
      Here, we describe a protein that binds to the DRPLA product. One of the clones 
      isolated with a yeast two-hybrid system was identified as a human homolog of the 
      insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate protein of 53 kDa (IRSp53). The gene 
      produced two mRNA forms by differential splicing and encoded 552 and 521 amino 
      acids, respectively. The longer form was mainly expressed in the brain and the 
      shorter one in other tissues. The products were phosphorylated upon stimulation 
      of cultured cells with insulin or insulin-like growth factor 1. Binding of the 
      DRPLA protein to IRSp53 was ascertained by co-immunoprecipitation with antibodies 
      and also by co-localization in perinuclear oval dots in cells expressing 
      engineered constructs. A proline-rich region near the polyglutamine tract of the 
      DRPLA protein and the SH3 domain of IRSp53 were involved in the binding. An 
      extended polyglutamine tract significantly reduced binding ability in yeast 
      cells, but not in in vitro binding assays. The identification of IRSp53 and other 
      proteins detected by the yeast hybrid system predicts that DRPLA functions in a 
      signal transduction pathway coupled with insulin/IGF-1.

TI  - Cleavage of atrophin-1 at caspase site aspartic acid 109 modulates cytotoxicity.
PG  - 8730-6
AB  - Dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is one of eight autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorders characterized by an abnormal CAG repeat expansion 
      which results in the expression of a protein with a polyglutamine stretch of 
      excessive length. We have reported recently that four of the gene products 
      (huntingtin, atrophin-1 (DRPLA), ataxin-3, and androgen receptor) associated with 
      these open reading frame triplet repeat expansions are substrates for the 
      cysteine protease cell death executioners, the caspases. This led us to 
      hypothesize that caspase cleavage of these proteins may represent a common step 
      in the pathogenesis of each of these four neurodegenerative diseases. Here we 
      present evidence that caspase cleavage of atrophin-1 modulates cytotoxicity and 
      aggregate formation. Cleavage of atrophin-1 at Asp109 by caspases is critical for 
      cytotoxicity because a mutant atrophin-1 that is resistant to caspase cleavage is 
      associated with significantly decreased toxicity. Further, the altered cellular 
      localization within the nucleus and aggregate formation associated with the 
      expanded form of atrophin-1 are completely suppressed by mutation of the caspase 
      cleavage site at Asp109. These results provide support for the toxic fragment 
      hypothesis whereby cleavage of atrophin-1 by caspases may be an important step in 
      the pathogenesis of DRPLA. Therefore, inhibiting caspase cleavage of the 
      polyglutamine-containing proteins may be a feasible therapeutic strategy to 
      prevent cell death.

      DRPLA. The mean variance of the change in the CAG repeat size in sperm from the 
      DRPLA patients (288.0) was larger than any variances of the CAG repeat size in 
      sperm from patients with Machado-Joseph disease (38. 5), Huntington's disease 
      (69.0) and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (16.3), which is consistent with 
      the clinical observation that the genetic anticipation on the paternal 
      transmission of DRPLA is the most prominent among CAG repeat diseases. The 
      variance of the change in CAG repeat size was significantly different between the 
      two DRPLA patients (F-test, P < 0.0001). However, the segregation ratio of single 
      sperm with an expanded allele to ones with a normal allele is not statistically 
      different ( P = 0.161) from the expected 1:1 segregation ratio, and thus 
      segregation distortion of expanded alleles in meiosis in male patients with DRPLA 
      was not demonstrated.

TI  - Transgenic mice harboring a full-length human mutant DRPLA gene exhibit 
      age-dependent intergenerational and somatic instabilities of CAG repeats 
      comparable with those in DRPLA patients.
PG  - 99-106
AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is one among an increasing number of 
      hereditary neurodegenerative diseases determined as being caused by unstable 
      expansion of CAG repeats coding for polyglutamine stretches. To investigate the 
      molecular mechanisms underlying CAG repeat instability, we established three 
      transgenic lines each harboring a single copy of a full-length human mutant DRPLA 
      gene carrying a CAG repeat expansion. These transgenic mice exhibited an 
      age-dependent increase (+0.31 per year) in male transmission and an age-dependent 
      contraction (-1.21 per year) in female transmission. Similar tendencies in 
      intergenerational instabilities were also observed in human DRPLA 
      parent-offspring pairs. The intergenerational instabilities of the CAG repeats 
      may be interpreted as being derived from the instability occurring during 
      continuous cell division of spermatogonia in the male, and that occurring during 
      the period of meiotic arrest in the female. The transgenic mice also exhibited an 
      age-dependent increase in the degree of somatic mosaicism which occurred in a 
      cell lineage-dependent manner, with the size range of CAG repeats being smaller 
      in the cerebellum than in other tissues including the cerebrum, consistent with 
      observations in autopsied tissues of DRPLA patients. Thus, the transgenic mice 
      described in this study exhibited age-dependent intergenerational as well as 
      somatic instabilities of expanded CAG repeats comparable with those observed in 
      human DRPLA patients, and are therefore expected to serve as good models for 
      investigating the molecular mechanisms of instabilities of CAG repeats.

TI  - Close associations between prevalences of dominantly inherited spinocerebellar 
      ataxias with CAG-repeat expansions and frequencies of large normal CAG alleles in 
      Japanese and Caucasian populations.
PG  - 1060-6
AB  - To test the hypothesis that the frequencies of normal alleles (ANs) with a 
      relatively large number of CAG repeats (large ANs) are related to the prevalences 
      of the dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs)-SCA types 1, 2, 3 (Machado-Joseph 
      disease), 6, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA)-we investigated the 
      relative prevalences of these diseases in 202 Japanese and 177 Caucasian families 
      and distributions of the number of CAG repeats of ANs at these disease loci in 
      normal individuals in each population. The relative prevalences of SCA1 and SCA2 
      were significantly higher in Caucasian pedigrees (15% and 14%, respectively) than 
      in Japanese pedigrees (3% and 5%, respectively), corresponding to the observation 
      that the frequencies of large ANs of SCA1 (alleles >30 repeats) and of SCA2 
      (alleles >22 repeats) were significantly higher in Caucasians than in Japanese. 
      The relative prevalences of MJD/SCA3, SCA6, and DRPLA were significantly higher 
      in Japanese pedigrees (43%, 11%, and 20%, respectively) than in Caucasian 
      pedigrees (30%, 5%, and 0%, respectively), corresponding to the observation that 
      the frequencies of large ANs of MJD/SCA3 (>27 repeats), SCA6 (>13 repeats), and 
      DRPLA (>17 repeats) were significantly higher in Japanese than in Caucasians. The 
      close correlations of the relative prevalences of the dominant SCAs with the 
      distributions of large ANs strongly support the assumption that large ANs 
      contribute to generation of expanded alleles (AEs) and the relative prevalences 
      of the dominant SCAs.

TI  - Intracellular aggregate formation of dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) 
      protein with the extended polyglutamine.
PG  - 96-102
AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by the abnormal CAG triplet-repeat expansion 
      resulting in an elongated polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch. We have recently showed 
      that the DRPLA protein is cleaved during apoptosis by caspase-3, one of the 
      cysteine protease family members known to be activated during apoptosis. We 
      report here the subcellular localization of the DRPLA protein by fusing the green 
      fluorescent protein as a tag. The full length DRPLA protein is localized 
      predominantly but not exclusively in the nucleus regardless of the length of the 
      polyQ stretch. In contrast, an N-terminal-deleted fragment containing polyQ 
      produced by the proteolytic cleavage with caspase-3 is found both in the nucleus 
      and the cytoplasm. Moreover, the same fragment with the elongated polyQ showed 
      aggregation when overexpressed. Some cells with aggregate formation showed 
      apoptotic phenotype. These findings raise the possibility that the DRPLA protein 
      processed by caspase-3 may lead to aggregation of the protein resulting in the 
      development of neurodegeneration.

TI  - CAG repeat expansions in patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 55-9
AB  - CAG repeat expansions cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), SCA2, SCA3, 
      SCA6 and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). So far these expansions 
      have been examined mainly in ataxia patients with a family history. However, some 
      sporadic cases with SCA have recently been reported. To elucidate the frequency 
      and characteristics of sporadic SCAs, we screened 85 Japanese ataxia patients 
      without a family history for the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and DRPLA mutations. As a 
      result, 19 patients (22%) were found to have expanded CAG repeats. Among sporadic 
      SCAs, the SCA6 mutation was most frequently observed. The sporadic SCA6 patients 
      had smaller CAG repeats and a later age of onset than SCA6 patients with an 
      established family history. We also identified one father-child pair in which 
      intermediate sized CAG repeats expanded into the SCA2 disease range during 
      transmission. These findings suggest that patients with ataxia even without a 
      family history should be examined for a CAG repeat expansion.

TI  - Atrophin-1, the DRPLA gene product, interacts with two families of WW 
      domain-containing proteins.
PG  - 149-60
AB  - Atrophin-1 contains a polyglutamine repeat, expansion of which is responsible for 
      dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The normal function of 
      atrophin-1 is unknown. We have identified five atrophin-1 interacting proteins 
      (AIPs) which bind to atrophin-1 in the vicinity of the polyglutamine tract using 
      the yeast two-hybrid system. Four of the interactions were confirmed using in 
      vitro binding assays. All five interactors contained multiple WW domains. Two are 
      novel. The AIPs can be divided into two distinct classes. AIP1 and AIP3/WWP3 are 
      MAGUK-like multidomain proteins containing a number of protein-protein 
      interaction modules, namely a guanylate kinase-like region, two WW domains, and 
      multiple PDZ domains. AIP2/WWP2, AIP4, and AIP5/WWP1 are highly homologous, each 
      having four WW domains and a HECT domain characteristic of ubiquitin ligases. 
      These interactors are similar to recently isolated huntingtin-interacting 
      proteins, suggesting possible commonality of function between two proteins 
      responsible for very similar diseases.

      SCA6, SCA7, and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). Expansion of a CAG 
      repeat in the disease genes has been found in five of these disorders. To 
      estimate the relative frequencies of the SCA1, DRPLA, MJD, SCA2, and SCA6 
      mutations among Portuguese ataxia patients, we collected DNA samples from 48 
      ataxia families and performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of 
      the CAG repeat mutations on chromosomes 6p, 12p, 14q, 12q, and 19p, respectively. 
      Fifty-five individuals belonging to 34 dominant families (74%) had an expanded 
      CAG repeat at the MJD gene. In five individuals from two kindreds with a dominant 
      pattern of inheritance (4%), an expanded CAG repeat at the SCA2 gene was found. 
      In MJD patients, the normal allele size ranged from 13 to 41, whereas the mutant 
      alleles contained 65 to 80 repeats. For the SCA2 patients, normal alleles had 22 
      or 23, while expanded alleles had between 36 and 47 CAG units. We did not find 
      the SCA1, DRPLA, or SCA6 mutations in our group of families. The MJD mutation 
      remains the most common cause of SCA in Portugal, while a small number of cases 
      are caused by mutations at the SCA2 gene, and 22% are due to still unidentified 
      genes.

TI  - Uncloned expanded CAG/CTG repeat sequences in autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia (ADCA) detected by the repeat expansion detection (RED) method.
PG  - 99-102
AB  - In some neurodegenerative diseases, genetic anticipation correlates with 
      expansions of the CAG/CTG repeat sequence above the normal range through the 
      generations of a pedigree. Among these neurodegenerative diseases are late onset 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA). ADCA are genetically heterogeneous 
      disorders with different cloned genes for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), 
      type 2 (SCA2), type 3 or Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), and type 6 (SCA6). 
      Another related dominant ataxia, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), 
      also shows CAG/CTG repeat expansions. Genetic anticipation has been reported for 
      all of them except for the recently cloned SCA6 gene. Other, as yet undetected 
      SCA genes may show the same features. We have used the repeat expansion detection 
      (RED) method to detect repeat expansions directly in DNA samples from ADCA 
      patients not resulting from known genes. Our sample consists of 19 affected index 
      cases, corresponding to 52.8% of our ADCA families without CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions in the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, or DRPLA genes. Eighty-nine percent 
      of the index cases had expansions of a CAG/CTG sequence greater than 40 repeats 
      by RED, while these were observed in only 26.9% of 78 healthy subjects from the 
      general population (p < 0.0001). The distribution of RED fragments in controls 
      and ADCA patients also shows significant differences with the Mann-Whitney U test 
      (U = 376.5, p = 0.0007). Moreover, there was a significant inverse correlation 
      between the size of expansion and the age of onset (r = -0.54, p = 0.018). These 
      results show CAG/CTG repeat expansions of over 40 repeats in our sample of ADCA 
      families not resulting from known SCA genes.

TI  - Suppression of aggregate formation and apoptosis by transglutaminase inhibitors 
      in cells expressing truncated DRPLA protein with an expanded polyglutamine 
      stretch.
PG  - 111-7
AB  - To elucidate the molecular mechanisms whereby expanded polyglutamine stretches 
      elicit a gain of toxic function, we expressed full-length and truncated DRPLA 
      (dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy) cDNAs with or without expanded CAG repeats 
      in COS-7 cells. We found that truncated DRPLA proteins containing an expanded 
      polyglutamine stretch form filamentous peri- and intranuclear aggregates and 
      undergo apoptosis. The apoptotic cell death was partially suppressed by the 
      transglutaminase inhibitors cystamine and monodansyl cadaverine (but not 
      putrescine), suggesting involvement of a transglutaminase reaction and providing 
      a potential basis for the development of therapeutic measures for CAG-repeat 
      expansion diseases.

TI  - Polymorphisms at 13 expressed human sequences containing CAG/CTG repeats and 
      analysis in autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) patients.
PG  - 18-21
AB  - Genetic anticipation--increasing severity and a decrease in the age of onset with 
      successive generations of a pedigree--is clearly present in autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia (ADCA). Anticipation is correlated with expansion of the 
      CAG/CTG repeat sequence to sizes above those in the normal range through the 
      generations of a pedigree. Genetic heterogeneity has been demonstrated for ADCA, 
      with four cloned genes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, and SCA6) and three mapped loci 
      (SCA4, SCA5 and SCA7). Another related dominant ataxia, 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), presents anticipation with CAG/CTG 
      repeat expansions. We had previously analysed ADCA patients who had not shown 
      repeat expansions in cloned genes for CAG/CTG repeat expansions by the repeat 
      expansion detection method (RED) and had detected expansions of between 48 and 88 
      units in 17 unrelated familial cases. We present here an analysis of 13 genes and 
      expressed sequence tags (ESTs) containing 10 or more CAG/CTG repeat sequences 
      selected from public databases in the 17 unrelated ADCA patients. Of the 13 
      selected genes and ESTs, 9 were found to be polymorphic with heterozygosities 
      ranging between 0.09 and 0.80 and 2 to 17 alleles. In ADCA patients none of the 
      loci showed expansions above the normal range of the CAG/CTG repeat sequences, 
      excluding them as the mutation causing ADCA.

TI  - Dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) protein is cleaved by caspase-3 
      during apoptosis.
PG  - 29238-42
AB  - Dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder. It is associated with an abnormal CAG repeat 
      expansion resulting in formation of a protein with an elongated polyglutamine 
      stretch. However, neither the physiological roles of the DRPLA gene product nor 
      molecular mechanisms of its pathogenesis have yet been elucidated. Here we report 
      that the DRPLA protein is cleaved at a site near the N terminus during apoptosis 
      induced by VP-16, staurosporine, or glucocorticoid. Moreover, the in vitro 
      translated DRPLA protein is cleaved by recombinant caspase-3, a member of the 
      cysteine protease family, which is thought to be a main executioner of apoptosis. 
      Using mutant DRPLA proteins, the cleavage site was identified as 106DSLDG110. The 
      cleavage, however, was not modulated by the length of the polyglutamine stretch. 
      These findings suggest that the DRPLA protein is one of the physiological 
      substrates of caspase-3, and its cleavage may result in structural and 
      biochemical alterations associated with apoptosis.

TI  - Two different pathological conditions of photoparoxysmal responses in hereditary 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy.
PG  - 285-9
AB  - In order to reveal the pathophysiology of photoparoxysmal responses (PPRs) in 
      photosensitive patients with hereditary dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) who had expansion of the CAG repeat in the DRPLA gene, we studied the 
      characteristics of PPRs using optical filters with specific wavelength 
      transmission. In two patients, the wavelength spectrum around 700 nm (670-720 nm) 
      was apparently the only visible range essential for eliciting PPRs, and flash 
      lights containing the essential wavelength elicited PPRs. In another patient, 
      PPRs were elicited by flash lights above certain quantity of light and 
      independent of the wavelength composition of the lights. These data suggest that 
      two different pathological conditions contribute to PPRs in DRPLA patients; one 
      condition depends on the essential wavelength spectrum around 700 nm, and the 
      other not on the wavelength, but on the quantity of light. The condition 
      contributing to PPRs in all three patients was not determined directly by the 
      level of the CAG repeat expansion in the DRPLA gene.

      neuropathological findings, we analyzed several brain regions from 9 cases of 
      DRPLA, 3 cases of MJD, and 1 case of SCA1. We found that the expanded alleles 
      were smaller in the cerebellar cortex than in other brain regions, such as the 
      frontal cortex, in these three diseases. The discrepancy in the expanded CAG 
      repeat length between cerebellar cortex and other tissues was most prominent in 
      DRPLA, and especially in cases of adult-onset DRPLA. A significant correlation 
      was found between the age at onset of DRPLA and the size of the CAG repeat 
      expansion. Cerebella of DRPLA patients were microscopically dissected into three 
      layers, the molecular and granular layers and the white matter, which were 
      analyzed separately. The lower level of CAG repeat expansion in DRPLA cerebella 
      was representative of CAG repeat expansion in the granule cells. The 
      microdissected samples of the granular layer of the hippocampal formation, which 
      is densely packed with neuronal cells, revealed that the degree of CAG repeat 
      expansion in this layer was similar to that in the cerebellum. These observations 
      suggest that granule cells in the cerebellum and hippocampus have low levels of 
      CAG repeat expansion, and that other types of cells exhibit a higher level of CAG 
      repeat expansion, in spinocerebellar ataxias.

      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) gene results in spastic paraplegia.
PG  - 1087-90
AB  - We report a family with autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia. Patient 1 was a 
      37-year-old woman and patient 2 was her 35-year-old sister. They showed spastic 
      paraplegia with mild truncal ataxia and dysarthria but no dementia, epilepsy, 
      myoclonus, or other involuntary movements. They were the products of a 
      consanguineous marriage but the parents were neurologically normal. We analyzed 
      the CAG repeats of the dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) gene in the 
      family members. The patients were homozygous for an allele carrying an 
      intermediate size of CAG repeats (41 or 40 repeats) in the DRPLA gene; the 
      parents were heterozygous for an intermediate allele and a normal allele in this 
      gene. Homozygosity for an intermediate allele in the DRPLA gene appears to have 
      resulted in spastic paraplegia different from any DRPLA phenotype.

TI  - The prevalence and wide clinical spectrum of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      trinucleotide repeat in patients with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 842-50
AB  - The dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) represent a clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of disorders linked by progressive deterioration in balance 
      and coordination. The utility of genetic classification of the ADCAs has been 
      highlighted by the striking variability in clinical phenotype observed within 
      families and the overlap in clinical phenotype observed between those with 
      different genotypes. The recent demonstration that spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      (SCA2) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion within the ataxin-2 gene has allowed 
      us to determine the frequency of SCA2 compared with SCA1, SCA3/Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD), and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) in patients with 
      sporadic and inherited ataxia. SCA2 accounts for 13% of patients with ADCA 
      (without retinal degeneration), intermediate between SCA1 and SCA3/MJD, which 
      account for 6% and 23%, respectively. Together, SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3/MJD 
      constitute >40% of the mutations leading to ADCA I in our population. No patient 
      without a family history of ataxia, or with a pure cerebellar or spastic 
      syndrome, tested positive for SCA1, SCA2, or SCA3. No overlap in ataxin-2 allele 
      size between normal and disease chromosomes, or intermediate-sized alleles, were 
      observed. Repeat length correlated inversely with age at onset, accounting for 
      approximately 80% of the variability in onset age. Haplotype analysis provided no 
      evidence for a single founder chromosome, and diverse ethnic origins were 
      observed among SCA2 kindreds. In addition, a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes 
      was observed among SCA2 patients, including typical mild dominant ataxia, the MJD 
      phenotype with facial fasciculations and lid retraction, and early-onset ataxia 
      with a rapid course, chorea, and dementia.

TI  - Southern analysis for detection of CAG repeat expansions associated with 
      dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy.
PG  - 354-6
AB  - Dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of an unstable, tandemly repeated 
      trinucleotide sequence, (CAG)n, in a novel gene on human chromosome 12p12-pter. 
      Molecular diagnosis of DRPLA uses the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify 
      and characterize the number of CAG repeats carried by individuals. The PCR 
      analysis is fairly straightforward when two alleles are identified. However, when 
      only a single allele is observed, it is difficult to know whether the sample is 
      homozygous or whether there was failure to amplify the second allele. We describe 
      a Southern analysis for detection of the DRPLA CAG repeat, providing an 
      independent method for the assessment of expanded alleles.

TI  - Instability of highly expanded CAG repeats in mice transgenic for the 
      Huntington's disease mutation.
PG  - 197-200
AB  - Six inherited neurodegenerative diseases are caused by a CAG/polyglutamine 
      expansion, including spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), Huntington's 
      disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), dentatorubral pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA) Machado-Joseph disease (MJD or SCA3) and SCA2. Normal and 
      expanded HD allele sizes of 6-39 and 35-121 repeats have been reported, and the 
      allele distributions for the other diseases are comparable. Intergenerational 
      instability has been described in all cases, and repeats tend to be more unstable 
      on paternal transmission. This may present as larger increases on paternal 
      inheritance as in HD, or as a tendency to increase on male and decrease on female 
      transmission as in SCA1 (ref. 15). Somatic repeat instability is also apparent 
      and appears most pronounced in the CNS. The major exception is the cerebellum, 
      which in HD, DRPLA, SCA1 and MJD has a smaller repeat relative to the other brain 
      regions tested. Of non-CNS tissues, instability was observed in blood, liver, 
      kidney and colon. A mouse model of CAG repeat instability would be helpful in 
      unravelling its molecular basis although an absence of CAG repeat instability in 
      transgenic mice has so far been reported. These studies include (CAG) in the 
      androgen receptor cDNA, (CAG) in the HD cDNA, (CAG) in the SCA1 cDNA, (CAG) in 
      the SCA3 cDNA and as an isolated (CAG) tract.

TI  - Peptides containing glutamine repeats as substrates for 
      transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking: relevance to diseases of the nervous 
      system.
PG  - 14580-5
AB  - Many proteins contain reiterated glutamine residues, but polyglutamine of 
      excessive length may result in human disease by conferring new properties on the 
      protein containing it. One established property of a glutamine residue, depending 
      on the nature of the flanking residues, is its ability to act as an amine 
      acceptor in a transglutaminase-catalyzed reaction and to make a glutamyl-lysine 
      cross-link with a neighboring polypeptide. To learn whether glutamine repeats can 
      act as amine acceptors, we have made peptides with variable lengths of 
      polyglutamine flanked by the adjacent amino acid residues in the proteins 
      associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), Machado-Joseph disease 
      (SCA3), or dentato-rubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) or those residues 
      adjacent to the preferred cross-linking site of involucrin, or solely by arginine 
      residues. The polyglutamine was found to confer excellent substrate properties on 
      any soluble peptide; under optimal conditions, virtually all the glutamine 
      residues acted as amine acceptors in the reaction with glycine ethyl-ester, and 
      lengthening the sequence of polyglutamine increased the reactivity of each 
      glutamine residue. In the presence of transglutaminase, peptides containing 
      polyglutamine formed insoluble aggregates with the proteins of brain extracts and 
      these aggregates contained glutamyl-lysine cross-links. Repeated glutamine 
      residues exposed on the surface of a neuronal protein should form cross-linked 
      aggregates in the presence of any transglutaminase activated by the presence of 
      Ca2+.

TI  - Reduction of CAG expansions in cerebellar cortex and spinal cord of DRPLA.
PG  - 199-201
AB  - Recent studies have identified an unstable expansion of a CAG repeat in a gene 
      located on chromosome 12 as a cause of dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA). To investigate whether the somatic heterogeneity may relate to the 
      selective neuronal damage caused by the disease, genomic DNA from various tissues 
      of an autopsied patient with DRPLA was examined to compare possible variations of 
      expanded CAG repeats for the disease. Although the size of the expanded CAG 
      repeat from many organs was almost the same as that from peripheral lymphocytes, 
      those from cerebellar cortex and spinal cord were unexpectedly reduced and 
      numbers of peaks within an expanded allele were relatively strict. These results 
      suggest that the CAG repeat is not simply expanded in the genome of the tissues 
      that are most involved in DRPLA, but that another mechanism might be responsible 
      for the specific neuronal death.

TI  - Somatic mosaicism of expanded CAG repeats in brains of patients with 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy: cellular population-dependent dynamics of 
      mitotic instability.
PG  - 1212-22
AB  - Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by unstable expansion of a CAG repeat in the 
      DRPLA gene. We performed detailed quantitative analysis of the size and the size 
      distribution (range) of the expanded CAG repeats in various regions of the CNS of 
      eight autopsied patients with DRPLA. Expanded alleles (AE) showed considerable 
      variations in size, as well as in range, depending on the region of the CNS, 
      whereas normal alleles did not show such variations, which indicates the 
      occurrence of somatic mosaicism of AE in the CNS. The AE in the cerebellar cortex 
      were consistently smaller by two to five repeat units than those in the 
      cerebellar white matter. Moreover, the AE in the cerebral cortex were smaller by 
      one to four repeat units than those in the cerebral white matter. These results 
      suggest that the smaller AE in the cerebellar and cerebral cortices represent 
      those of neuronal cells. The ranges of the AE in the cerebral cortex, cerebral 
      white matter, and cerebellar white matter showed considerable variation ranging 
      from 9 to 23 repeat units, whereas those in the cerebellar cortex showed little 
      variance and were approximately 7 repeat units. The ranges of the AE in the 
      cerebral cortex, cerebral white matter, and cerebellar white matter were much 
      broader in patients with higher ages at death than they were in patients with 
      lower ages at death, raising the possibility that the range of AE increases with 
      time, as the result of mitotic instability of AE.

TI  - Reevaluation of the exact CAG repeat length in hereditary cerebellar ataxias 
      using highly denaturing conditions and long PCR.
PG  - 591-5
AB  - Hereditary cerebellar ataxias, including spinocerebellar ataxia type I (SCA1), 
      dentato-rubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), 
      have been associated with unstable CAG repeats. The length of the CAG repeat is a 
      major factor in determining the age of onset of these diseases. In 
      electrophoresis through acrylamide gels with formamide, the CAG repeat length 
      following the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coincides with the 
      sequence-determined repeat length after subcloning. However, without formamide, 
      PCR products with long CAG repeats appear 1-4 repeats shorter than when 
      electrophoresed with formamide, and the repeat lengths are variable. In addition, 
      the larger the CAG repeats are, the more difficult are the PCR reactions. A 
      mixture containing thermostable Taq and Pwo DNA polymerases (so-called "long 
      PCR") is much more sensitive than that with Taq polymerase alone in detecting- 
      expanded CAG repeats. Therefore, highly denaturing conditions, especially 
      formamide gel electrophoresis, and the "long PCR" protocol should be used to 
      evaluate the exact CAG repeat length. We have used these principles to detect 
      unstable CAG repeats. The normal ranges are 14-34 repeats for MJD, 6-31 repeats 
      for DRPLA, and 21-32 repeats for SCA1.

      diagnosed with dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), on the basis of the 
      neuropathologic findings. Because the clinical and pathologic reevaluation 
      strongly suggested a diagnosis of MJD, we conducted a genetic study in the 
      family. Two patients, aged 38 and 40, revealed CAG repeat lengths of the MJD1 
      gene of 80, 28 and 75, 14, confirming a final diagnosis of MJD.

TI  - Non-Mendelian transmission in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and 
      Machado-Joseph disease: the mutant allele is preferentially transmitted in male 
      meiosis.
PG  - 730-3
AB  - Autosomal dominant dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) are neurodegenerative disorders caused by CAG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions. An inverse correlation of age at onset with the 
      length of the expanded CAG trinucleotide repeats has been demonstrated, and the 
      intergenerational instability of the length of the CAG trinucleotide repeats, 
      which is more prominent in paternal than in maternal transmissions, has been 
      shown to underlie the basic mechanisms of anticipation in DRPLA and MJD. Our 
      previous observations on DRPLA and MJD pedigrees, as well as a review of the 
      literature, have suggested that the numbers of affected offspring exceed those of 
      unaffected offspring, which is difficult to explain by the Mendelian principle of 
      random segregation of alleles. In the present study, we analyzed the segregation 
      patterns in 211 transmissions in 24 DRPLA pedigrees and 80 transmissions in 7 MJD 
      pedigrees, with the diagnoses confirmed by molecular testing. Significant 
      distortions in favor of transmission of the mutant alleles were found in male 
      meiosis, where the mutant alleles were transmitted to 62% of all offspring in 
      DRPLA (chi2 = 7.69; P<.01) and 73% in MJD (chi2 = 6.82; P<.01). The results were 
      consistent with meiotic drive in DRPLA and MJD. Since more prominent meiotic 
      instability of the length of the CAG trinucleotide repeats is observed in male 
      meiosis than in female meiosis and meiotic drive is observed only in male 
      meiosis, these results raise the possibility that a common molecular mechanism 
      underlies the meiotic drive and the meiotic instability in male meiosis.

PG  - 373-9
AB  - Dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder associated with the expansion of a CAG repeat at 
      chromosome band 12p13. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an increased 
      prevalence of DRPLA in Japan, although several DRPLA kindreds of non-Japanese 
      ancestry have been identified. To define the molecular basis for this geographic 
      variation in prevalence, we have analyzed haplotypes around the repeat in several 
      different ethnic groups. Two intragenic biallelic polymorphisms distinguished 
      three haplotypes, each of which formed a predominant haplotype found in the three 
      major racial populations. All the expanded repeats of Japanese and Caucasian 
      patients studied were associated with a particular haplotype, which otherwise was 
      associated with longer repeats commonly found in Asians. Our results support a 
      multi-step model for repeat expansion, and suggest that expanded DRPLA repeats 
      may have evolved from an ancient chromosomal haplotype of Asian origin. We also 
      propose that a combination of a highly polymorphic microsatellite marker with 
      relatively stable biallelic markers in a range of PCR amplification is a powerful 
      tool for studies on human genome diversity, which may reveal the ancient human 
      migration and the formation of ethnic groups.

      disease, and X-linked recessive spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.
PG  - 43-50
AB  - We investigated the somatic mosaicism of trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 
      neural and nonneural tissues of a dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) 
      patient and their correlation to the topographical distribution of the 
      pathological involvement. The spatial pattern of tissue-specific somatic 
      mosaicism in the CAG repeat size was significantly different among the DRPLA, MJD 
      and SBMA patients. The size of the major bands of the mutant CAG repeat allele 
      was significantly smaller in the cerebellar cortex in both DRPLA and MJD patients 
      by 6 and 2 repeat units respectively and larger in the colon and liver of DRPLA 
      by 5 repeats or more. There were also 1-2 repeat-sized small variations of major 
      band size among the neural tissues in DRPLA. In contrast, there was no 
      tissue-specific variation of major bands of CAG repeats and diversity of extra 
      bands among the examined tissues including the cerebellum in the SBMA patient. 
      There was no parallel occurrence of tissue-specific CAG instability and severity 
      of neuropathological involvement in the neural and nonneural tissues of DRPLA, 
      MJD and SBMA patients. Lack of significant tissue-specific somatic mosaicism in 
      SBMA including the cerebellar cortex may suggest that CAG repeat expansion in the 
      mutant androgen receptor gene is far more stable compared with that in DRPLA and 
      MJD as well as those reported in Huntington's disease.

TI  - Frequency of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy, 
      and Machado-Joseph disease mutations in a large group of spinocerebellar ataxia 
      patients.
PG  - 214-8
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders varying in both clinical manifestations and mode of inheritance. Six 
      different genes causing autosomal dominant SCA are mapped: SCA1, SCA2, 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA4, SCA5, and dentatorubropallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA). Expansions of an unstable trinucleotide CAG repeat cause three 
      of these disorders: SCA type 1 (SCA1), MJD, and DRPLA. We determine the frequency 
      of the SCA1, DRPLA, and MJD mutations in a large group of unrelated SCA patients 
      with various patterns of inheritance and different ethnic backgrounds. We studied 
      92 unrelated SCA patients. The frequency of the SCA1 mutation was 3% in the 
      overall patient group and 10% in the non-Portuguese dominantly inherited SCA 
      subgroup. We found that DRPLA mutation in only one Japanese patient, who was 
      previously diagnosed with this disease. We identified the MJD mutation in 41% of 
      the overall patient group, which included 38 autosomal dominant kindreds of 
      Portuguese origin; the frequency of the MJD mutation among the non-Portuguese 
      dominantly inherited cases was 17%. These results suggest that SCA may be 
      occasionally caused by the SCA1 mutation and rarely caused by the DRPLA mutation 
      and that, to date, the MJD mutation seems to be the most common cause of 
      dominantly inherited SCA. Finally, our results suggest that recessively inherited 
      cases of SCA are not caused by the known trinucleotide repeat expansions.

TI  - Molecular re-investigation of patients with Huntington's disease in Wessex 
      reveals a family with dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy.
PG  - 76-8
AB  - Dentatorubral and pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA), a neurological disorder thought 
      to be rare in European populations, is caused by a triplet repeat expansion in 
      the B37 gene on chromosome 12. This disorder can phenotypically mimic 
      Huntington's disease (HD) which is also caused by a repeat expansion. We have 
      analysed 139 affected individuals for the HD triplet repeat expansion and found 
      132 patients had one normal and one expanded allele. Two patients had an 
      expansion on both chromosomes and five patients had two normal-size alleles. Of 
      these five patients, two were considered to be atypical Two patients who were 
      father and daughter were found to have an expansion of the DRPLA triplet repeat. 
      This therefore constitutes the second such family described in the United 
      Kingdom.

TI  - Somatic mosaicism of CAG repeat in dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA).
PG  - 663-6
AB  - An unstable expansion of CAG repeat in the coding region of the DRPLA gene on 
      chromosome 12p is the mutation specific for hereditary 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). We studied the CAG expansion in 
      brain and other tissues from six unrelated DRPLA patients. The CAG repeat lengths 
      showed distinct differences between tissues. The sizes of the CAG expansion in 
      various regions of the brain except the cerebellum were generally larger by 
      several repeats than in other peripheral tissues. Brain samples showed greater 
      variation of the expansion compared with other tissues, but neither the size of 
      the CAG expansion nor the degree of CAG repeat variation parallels the detailed 
      findings of neuropathological involvement. We conclude that somatic instabilities 
      of the CAG repeat cause tissue variability of the CAG repeat size in DRPLA but 
      other region or cell type-specific factors would be involved to explain the 
      selectivity of cell damage in DRPLA.

AB  - Dentato-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy (DR-PLA) is considered to be rare in 
      Europe. We describe a Danish family in which affected individuals in at least 
      three generations have been diagnosed as suffering from Huntington's disease. 
      Because analysis of the Huntingtin gene revealed normal alleles and various of 
      the patients had seizures, we analysed the B37 gene and found significantly 
      elongated CAG repeats as have been reported in DRPLA. Affected individuals with 
      almost identical repeat lengths presented very different symptoms. Both expansion 
      and contraction in paternal transmission was encountered.

TI  - DNA analysis in hereditary dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy: correlation 
      between CAG repeat length and phenotypic variation and the molecular basis of 
      anticipation.
PG  - 143-9
AB  - Hereditary dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disease with variable clinical phenotypes. Progressive ataxia, 
      choreoathetosis, and dementia are the main clinical features of adult-onset 
      cases, whereas the main feature in juvenile-onset DRPLA is progressive myoclonus 
      epilepsy. Earlier onset is apparent in successive generations (anticipation). The 
      molecular abnormality underlying DRPLA is an expanded, unstable CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat on chromosome 12p. We analyzed 71 DNA samples obtained from 12 Japanese 
      DRPLA pedigrees that included 38 affected individuals. Normal alleles had 7 to 23 
      repeats, DRPLA alleles 53 to 88 repeats. DRPLA alleles also were detected in five 
      asymptomatic family members. Patients with juvenile onset had significantly 
      larger repeats than did those with adult onset, and there was a significant 
      negative correlation between CAG repeat length and age at onset. In 80% of the 
      paternal transmissions, there was an increase of more than five repeats, whereas 
      all the maternal transmissions showed either a decrease or an increase of fewer 
      than five repeats. There was a significant correlation between father-child 
      differences in repeat length and differences in age at onset. The analysis of CAG 
      repeat length is a reliable diagnostic test for DRPLA and is of value for the 
      presymptomatic detection of individuals at risk. The expansion of CAG repeats is 
      important in phenotypic variation and anticipation. In addition, the sex of the 
      transmitting parent has a significant effect on the molecular mechanism of 
      anticipation.

TI  - High-intensity proton and T2-weighted MRI signals in the globus pallidus in 
      juvenile-type of dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy.
PG  - 234-7
AB  - Dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder. An expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat sequence motif 
      in a gene on the short arm of chromosome 12 has recently been identified in 
      patients with DRPLA. Juvenile-type DRPLA is characterized by childhood onset and 
      progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME). According to the pathological study, the 
      degeneration of the globus pallidus is more marked in this than in other types. 
      We observed high-intensity signals in the globus pallidus on proton and 
      T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a patient clinically diagnosed as 
      juvenile-type DRPLA who had the expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat motif in the 
      DRPLA gene. The globus pallidus may be affected in the early stages of this type 
      of DRPLA, and MRI may be useful for the early diagnosis of DRPLA.

      dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA).
PG  - 177-82
AB  - Dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy is associated with expansion of an 
      unstable CAG repeat on chromosome 12p. We have determined the nucleotide 
      sequences of overlapping cDNA clones and deduced the gene structure. The gene is 
      ubiquitously expressed to form a single 4.5 kb transcript and encoded by an open 
      reading frame of 1184 amino acids (aa), in which a polyglutamine track with 
      variable length starts at aa 484. Although the predicted amino acid sequence does 
      not reveal any function, it does contain several interesting motifs consisting of 
      a simple repeated amino acid sequence, a homo-proline track, two stretches of 
      arginine-glutamic acid dipeptides and a stretch of alternative histidine 
      residues. These results provide clues toward understanding neurodegenerative 
      diseases associated with triplet repeat expansion.

TI  - Unstable expansion of CAG repeat in hereditary dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA).
PG  - 9-13
AB  - Hereditary dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurologic disorder characterized by variable combinations of myoclonus, 
      epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, choreoathetosis and dementia. By specifically 
      searching published brain cDNA sequences for the presence of CAG repeats we 
      identified unstable expansion of a CAG in a gene on chromosome 12 in all the 22 
      DRPLA patients examined. A good correlation between the size of the CAG repeat 
      expansion and the ages of disease onset is found in this group. Patients with 
      earlier onset tended to have a phenotype of progressive myoclonus epilepsy and 
      larger expansions. We propose that the wide variety of clinical manifestations of 
      DRPLA can now be explained by the variable unstable expansion of the CAG repeat.

TI  - Dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy expansion of an unstable CAG 
      trinucleotide on chromosome 12p.
PG  - 14-8
AB  - Dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder characterized by combined systemic degeneration of the 
      dentatofugal and pallidofugal pathways. We investigated a candidate gene and 
      found that DRPLA patients had an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in a gene on 
      the short arm of chromosome 12. The repeat size varied from 7-23 in normal 
      individuals. In patients one allele was expanded to between 49-75 repeats or 
      occasionally even more. Expansion was usually associated with paternal 
      transmission and only occasionally with maternal transmission. Repeat size showed 
      a close correlation with age of onset of symptoms and disease severity. We 
      conclude that DRPLA is the seventh genetic disorder known to be associated with 
      expansion of an unstable trinucleotide repeat.

TI  - Triplet repeats in clinical subtypes of schizophrenia: variation at the DRPLA (B 
      37 CAG repeat) locus is not associated with periodic catatonia.
PG  - 153-7
AB  - Clinical evidence for a dominant mode of inheritance and anticipation in periodic 
      catatonia, a distinct subtype of schizophrenia, indicates that genes with triplet 
      repeat expansions or other unstable repetitive elements affecting gene expression 
      may be involved in the etiology of this disorder. Because patients affected with 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) may present with "schizophrenic" 
      symptoms, we have investigated the DRPLA (B 37 CAG repeat) locus on chromosome 12 
      in 41 patients with periodic catatonia. The B 37 CAG repeat locus was highly 
      polymorphic but all alleles in both the patient and control group had repeat 
      sizes within the normal range. We conclude that variation at the DRPLA locus is 
      unlikely to be associated with periodic catatonia. The evidence for dominant 
      inheritance and anticipation as well as the high prevalence of human brain genes 
      containing trinucleotide repeats justifies further screening for triplet repeat 
      expansions in periodic catatonia.
