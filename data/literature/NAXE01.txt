AB  - Repeat expansions cause at least 50 hereditary disorders, including Friedreich 
      ataxia and other diseases known to cause mitochondrial dysfunction. We identified 
      a patient with NAXE-related mitochondrial encephalopathy and novel biallelic 
      GGGCC repeat expansion as long as ~200 repeats in the NAXE promoter region using 
      long-read sequencing. In addition to a marked reduction in the RNA and protein, 
      we found a marked reduction in nascent RNA in the promoter using native 
      elongating transcript-cap analysis of gene expression (NET-CAGE), suggesting 
      transcriptional suppression. Accordingly, CpG hypermethylation was observed in 
      the repeat region. Genetic analyses determined that homozygosity in the patient 
      was due to maternal chromosome 1 uniparental disomy (UPD). We assessed short 
      variants within NAXE including the repeat region in the undiagnosed mitochondrial 
      encephalopathy cohort of 242 patients. This study identified the GGGCC repeat 
      expansion causing a mitochondrial disease and suggests that UPD could 
      significantly contribute to homozygosity for rare repeat-expanded alleles.
