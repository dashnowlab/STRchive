TI  - Dampened alpha7 nAChR activity contributes to audiogenic seizures and hyperactivity 
      in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome.

LID - 10.1101/2024.11.01.621616 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual 
      disability and often accompanied with debilitating pathologies including seizures 
      and hyperactivity. FXS arises from a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' UTR 
      of the FMR1 gene that silences expression of the RNA-binding protein FMRP. 
      Despite progress in understanding FMRP functions, the identification of effective 
      therapeutic targets has lagged and at present there are no viable treatment 
      options. Here we identify the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) as 
      candidate target for intervention in FXS. In the early postnatal hippocampus of 
      Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, an established pre-clinical model of FXS, the alpha7 nAChR 
      accessory protein Ly6H is abnormally enriched at the neuronal surface and 
      mislocalized in dendrites. Ly6H, a GPI-anchored protein, binds alpha7 nAChRs with 
      high affinity and can limit alpha7 nAChR surface expression and signaling. We find 
      that alpha7 nAChR-evoked Ca(2+) responses are dampened in immature glutamatergic and 
      GABAergic Fmr1 (KO) neurons compared to wild type. Knockdown of endogenous Ly6H 
      in Fmr1 (KO) neurons is sufficient to rescue dampened alpha7 nAChR Ca(2+) responses 
      in vitro, providing evidence of a cell-autonomous role for Ly6H aberrant 
      expression in alpha7 nAChR hypofunction. In line with intrinsic deficits in alpha7 nAChR 
      activity in Fmr1 (KO) neurons, in vivo administration of the alpha7 nAChR-selective 
      positive allosteric modulator PNU-120596 reduced hyperactivity and seizure 
      severity in adolescent Fmr1 (KO) mice. Our mechanistic studies together with 
      evidence of the in vivo efficacy of alpha7 nAChR augmentation implicate alpha7 nAChR 
      hypofunction in FXS pathology.

AB  - The Repeat Expansion Diseases (REDs) are a large group of human genetic disorders 
      that result from an increase in the number of repeats in a disease-specific 
      tandem repeat or microsatellite. Emerging evidence suggests that the repeats 
      trigger an error-prone form of DNA repair that causes the expansion mutation by 
      exploiting a limitation in normal mismatch repair. Furthermore, while much 
      remains to be understood about how the mutation causes pathology in different 
      diseases in this group, there is evidence to suggest that some of the downstream 
      consequences of repeat expansion trigger the DNA damage response in ways that 
      contribute to disease pathology. This review will discuss these subjects in the 
      context of the Fragile X-related disorders (aka the FMR1 disorders) that provide 
      a particularly interesting example of the intersection between the repeats and 
      the DNA damage response that may also be relevant for many other diseases in this 
      group.

TI  - dmTGS: Precise Targeted Enrichment Long-Read Sequencing Panel for Tandem Repeat 
      Detection.
LID - hvae164 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/clinchem/hvae164 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tandem repeats (TRs) are abundant in the human genome and associated 
      with repeat expansion disorders. Our study aimed to develop a tandem repeat panel 
      utilizing targeted long-read sequencing to evaluate known TRs associated with 
      these disorders and assess its clinical utility. METHODS: We developed a targeted 
      long-read sequencing panel for 70 TR loci, termed dynamic mutation 
      third-generation sequencing (dmTGS), using the PacBio Sequel II platform. We 
      tested 108 samples with suspected repeat expansion disorders and compared the 
      results with conventional molecular methods. RESULTS: For 108 samples, dmTGS 
      achieved an average of 8000 high-fidelity reads per sample, with a mean read 
      length of 4.7 kb and read quality of 99.9%. dmTGS outperformed repeat-primed-PCR 
      and fluorescence amplicon length analysis-PCR in distinguishing expanded from 
      normal alleles and accurately quantifying repeat counts. The method demonstrated 
      high concordance with confirmatory methods (rlinear = 0.991, P < 0.01), and 
      detected mosaicism with sensitivities of 1% for FMR1 CGG premutation and 5% for 
      full mutations. dmTGS successfully identified interruptive motifs in genes that 
      conventional methods had missed. For variable number TRs in the PLIN4 gene, dmTGS 
      identified precise repeat counts and sequence motifs. Screening 57 patients with 
      suspected genetic muscular diseases, dmTGS confirmed repeat expansions in genes 
      such as GIPC1, NOTCH2NLC, NUTM2B-AS1/LOC642361, and DMPK. Additionally, dmTGS 
      detected CCG interruptions in CTG repeats in 8 myotonic dystrophy type 1 patients 
      with detailed characterization. CONCLUSIONS: dmTGS accurately detects repeat 
      sizes and interruption motifs associated with repeat expansion disorders and 
      demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional molecular methods.

AB  - The fragile X premutation is a public health concern worldwide. Implementing a 
      comprehensive screening program for FMR1 premutation alleles could empower 
      individuals and families with information, supporting informed health decisions 
      and potentially reducing the incidence of fragile X syndrome (FXS). This study 
      aimed to determine the prevalence of FMR1 premutations in the Thai population. We 
      screened 369 female blood donors and 449 males with tremor and/or ataxia who 
      tested negative for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, and 3 for FMR1 CGG 
      repeat expansions. Among the female blood donors, 0.27% (1/369) had a premutation 
      allele, and 1.08% (4/369) had intermediate alleles. One female with a premutation 
      carrier had 89 CGG repeats with one AGG interruption. In the male cohort, no 
      premutations or full mutations were found; however, intermediate alleles were 
      identified in 0.67% (3/449) of the males. This study provides the evidence of 
      fragile X premutation screening in the Thai population. These findings contribute 
      to the understanding of FMR1 premutation prevalence in Thailand and should 
      encourage wider discussions on the feasibility for a national fragile X carrier 
      screening program in Thailand to reduce the burden of fragile X-associated 
      disorders.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a CGG 
      repeat expansion >/= 200 repeats in 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene, 
      leading to intellectual disability and cognitive difficulties, including in the 
      domain of communication. A recent phase 2a clinical trial testing BPN14770, a 
      phosphodiesterase 4D inhibitor, showed improved cognition in 30 adult males with 
      FXS on drug relative to placebo. The initial study found significant improvements 
      in clinical measures assessing cognition, language, and daily functioning in 
      addition to marginal improvements in electroencephalography (EEG) results for the 
      amplitude of the N1 event-related potential (ERP) component. These EEG results 
      suggest BPN14770 improved neural hyperexcitability in FXS. The current study 
      investigated the relationship between BPN14770 pharmacokinetics and the amplitude 
      of the N1 ERP component from the initial data. Consistent with the original 
      group-level finding post-period 1 of the study, participants who received 
      BPN14770 in period 1 showed a significant correlation between N1 amplitude and 
      serum concentration of BPN14770 measured at the end of period 1. These findings 
      strengthen the validity of the original result, indicating that BPN14770 improves 
      cognitive performance by modulating neural hyperexcitability. This study 
      represents the first report of a significant correlation between a reliably 
      abnormal EEG marker and serum concentration of a novel pharmaceutical in FXS.

TI  - Population-based FMR1 carrier screening among reproductive women.
LID - 10.1007/s10815-024-03242-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, caused by an 
      CGG repeat expansion (FM, > 200 CGG) in the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 
      1 (FMR1) gene. Female carriers of a premutation (PM; 55-200 CGG) can transmit the 
      PM allele, which, depending on the CGG allele size, can expand to an allele in 
      the FM range in the offspring. METHODS: Carrier screening for FMR1 PM is not 
      available in Thailand. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of PM 
      carriers among Thai reproductive women at the tertiary hospital. A total of 1250 
      females participated in this study; ages ranged from 20 to 45 years, mean of 
      30 years (S.D. = 6.27). RESULTS: Two carriers of a premutation allele, with 32,62 
      and 32,69 CGG repeats respectively, were identified. This corresponds to 1 in 600 
      women or 0.17% of the population. Further, three women carrying a gray zone 
      allele (45-54 CGG repeats) were identified (29,51; 29,49; and 30,47 CGG repeats) 
      which equals to 1:400 women or 0.25% of the population. No FM case was detected. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study heightens the importance of PM carrier screening of women 
      of reproductive age, particularly for the higher risk of developing fragile 
      X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). Early identification of PM 
      carrier status enhances family planning and fecundity alternatives and improves 
      reproductive health outcomes leading to a better life.

TI  - Repeat length in spinocerebellar ataxia type 4 (SCA4) predicts age at onset and 
      disease severity.
PG  - 6289-6300
LID - 10.1007/s00415-024-12600-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, an exonic GGC repeat expansion (RE) was identified by 
      long-read genome sequencing in the ZFHX3 gen, causing spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      4 (SCA4), a dominant form of ataxia with sensory neuropathy. However, the 
      analysis of larger cohorts of patients remained demanding, resulting in a 
      challenge to diagnose patients and leaving the question of anticipation in SCA4 
      unanswered. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop a GGC repeat test for clinical SCA4 
      screening and to apply this test to screen two large German SCA pedigrees and 
      samples of unrelated patients collected over the last 25 years. METHODS: We 
      modulated a commercial GGC-RE kit (Bio-Techne AmplideX((R)) Asuragen((R)) PCR/CE FMR1 
      Reagents) with ZFHX3-specific primers and adapted PCR conditions. The test was 
      applied to patients and 50 healthy controls to determine the exact repeat number. 
      Clinical data were revised and correlated with the expanded allele sizes and an 
      exploratory analysis of structural MRI was performed. RESULTS: Repeat size, 
      determined by our protocol for (GGC)(n) RE analysis shows a strong inverse 
      correlation between repeat length and age at onset and anticipation in subsequent 
      generations. The phenotype also appears to be more strongly expressed in carriers 
      of longer RE. Clinical red flags were slowed saccades, sensory neuropathy and 
      autonomic dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Our protocol enables cost-effective and robust 
      screening for the causative SCA4 RE within ZFHX3. Furthermore, detailed clinical 
      data of our patients gives a more precise view on SCA4, which seems to be more 
      common among patients with ataxia than expected.

TI  - Fragile X Syndrome and FMR1 premutation: results from a survey on associated 
      conditions and treatment priorities in Italy.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of 
      inherited intellectual disability, caused by CGG-repeat expansions (> 200) in the 
      FMR1 gene leading to lack of expression. Espansion between 55 and 200 triplets 
      fall within the premutation range (PM) and can lead to different clinical 
      conditions, including fragile X- primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), fragile 
      X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (FXAND) and fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Although there is not a current cure for FXS and 
      for the Fragile X-PM associated conditions (FXPAC), timely diagnosis as well as 
      the implementation of treatment strategies, psychoeducation and behavioral 
      intervention may improve the quality of life (QoL) of people with FXS or FXPAC. 
      With the aim to investigate the main areas of concerns and the priorities of 
      treatment in these populations, the Italian National Fragile X Association in 
      collaboration with Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, conducted a survey among 
      Italian participants. METHOD: Here, we present a survey based on the previous 
      study that Weber and colleagues conducted in 2019 and that aimed to investigate 
      the main symptoms and challenges in American individuals with FXS. The survey has 
      been translated into Italian language to explore FXS needs of treatment also 
      among Italian individuals affected by FXS, family members, caretakers, and 
      professionals. Furthermore, we added a section designated only to people with PM, 
      to investigate the main symptoms, daily living challenges and treatment 
      priorities. RESULTS: Anxiety, challenging behaviors, language difficulties and 
      learning disabilities were considered the major areas of concern in FXS, while PM 
      was reported as strongly associated to cognitive problems, social anxiety, and 
      overthinking. Anxiety was reported as a treatment priority in both FXS and PM. 
      CONCLUSION: FXS and PM can be associated with a range of cognitive, affective, 
      and physical health complications. Taking a patient-first perspective may help 
      clinicians to better characterize the cognitive-behavioral phenotype associated 
      to these conditions, and eventually to implement tailored therapeutic approaches.

AB  - There is an obvious clinical-pathological overlap between essential tremor and 
      some known tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansion disorders. The aim is 
      to analyse whether these short tandem repeat genes, including ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, TBP, BEAN1, NOP56, DAB1, ATN1, 
      SADM12 and FMR1, are associated with familial essential tremor patients. Genetic 
      analysis of repeat sizes in tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansions was 
      performed in a large cohort of 515 familial essential tremor probands and 300 
      controls. The demographic and clinical features among carriers of pathogenic 
      expansions, intermediate repeats and non-carriers were compared. A total of 18 
      out of 515 (18/515, 3.7%) patients were found to have repeats expansions, 
      including 12 cases (12/515, 2.5%) with intermediate repeat expansions (one ATXN1, 
      eight TBP, two FMR1, one ATN1), and six cases (6/515, 1.2%) with pathogenic 
      expansions (one ATXN1, one ATXN2, one ATXN8OS, one PPP2R2B, one FMR1, one 
      SAMD12). There were no statistically significant differences in intermediate 
      repeats compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, there were no significant 
      differences in demographics and clinical features among individuals with 
      pathogenic expansions, intermediate repeat expansions carriers and non-carriers. 
      Our study indicates that the intermediate repeat expansion in tremor-associated 
      short tandem repeat expansions does not pose an increased risk for essential 
      tremor, and rare pathogenic expansion carriers have been found in the familial 
      essential tremor cohort. The diagnosis of essential tremor based solely on 
      clinical symptoms remains a challenge in distinguishing it from known short 
      tandem repeat expansions diseases with overlapping clinical-pathological 
      features.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a CGG 
      repeat expansion >/= 200 repeats in 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene, 
      leading to intellectual disability and cognitive difficulties, including in the 
      domain of communication. A recent phase 2a clinical trial testing BPN14770, a 
      phosphodiesterase 4D inhibitor, showed improved cognition in 30 adult males with 
      FXS on drug relative to placebo. The initial study found significant improvements 
      in clinical measures assessing cognition, language, and daily functioning in 
      addition to marginal improvements in electroencephalography (EEG) results for the 
      amplitude of the N1 event-related potential (ERP) component. EEG results suggest 
      BPN14770 improved neural hyperexcitability in FXS. The current study investigated 
      the relationship between BPN14770 pharmacokinetics (PK) and the amplitude of the 
      N1 ERP component from the initial data. Consistent with the original group-level 
      finding in period 1 of the study, participants who received BPN14770 in the 
      period 1 showed a significant correlation between N1 amplitude and serum 
      concentration of BPN14770. These findings strengthen the validity of the original 
      result, indicating that BPN14770 improves cognitive performance by modulating 
      neural hyperexcitability. This study represents the first report of significant 
      correlation between a reliably abnormal EEG marker and serum concentration of a 
      novel pharmaceutical in FXS.

AB  - The human genome has many short tandem repeats, yet the normal functions of these 
      repeats are unclear. The 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the fragile X messenger 
      ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene contains polymorphic CGG repeats, the length of 
      which has differing effects on FMR1 expression and human health, including the 
      neurodevelopmental disorder fragile X syndrome. We deleted the CGG repeats in the 
      FMR1 gene (0CGG) in human stem cells and examined the effects on differentiated 
      neurons. 0CGG neurons have altered subcellular localization of FMR1 mRNA and 
      protein, and differential expression of cellular stress proteins compared with 
      neurons with normal repeats (31CGG). In addition, 0CGG neurons have altered 
      responses to glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation, including FMR1 mRNA 
      localization, GR chaperone HSP90alpha expression, GR localization, and cellular 
      stress protein levels. Therefore, the CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene are important 
      for the homeostatic responses of neurons to stress signals.

AB  - FMR1 premutation carriers (55-200 CGG repeats) are at risk of developing fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a neurodegenerative disorder 
      associated with motor and cognitive impairment. Bilateral hyperintensities of the 
      middle cerebellar peduncles (MCP sign) are the major radiological hallmarks of 
      FXTAS. In the general population, enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are 
      biomarkers of small vessel disease and glymphatic dysfunction and are associated 
      with cognitive decline. Our aim was to determine if premutation carriers show 
      higher ratings of PVS than controls and whether enlarged PVS are associated with 
      motor and cognitive impairment, MRI features of neurodegeneration, 
      cerebrovascular risk factors and CGG repeat length. We evaluated 655 MRIs (1-10 
      visits/participant) from 229 carriers (164 with FXTAS and 65 without FXTAS) and 
      133 controls. PVS in the basal ganglia (BG-EPVS), centrum semiovale, and midbrain 
      were evaluated with a semiquantitative scale. Mixed-effects models were used for 
      statistical analysis adjusting for age. In carriers with FXTAS, we revealed that 
      (1) BG-PVS ratings were higher than those of controls and carriers without FXTAS; 
      (2) BG-PVS severity was associated with brain atrophy, white matter 
      hyperintensities, enlarged ventricles, FXTAS stage and abnormal gait; (3) 
      age-related increase in BG-PVS was associated with cognitive dysfunction; and (4) 
      PVS ratings of all three regions showed robust associations with CGG repeat 
      length and were higher in carriers with the MCP sign than carriers without the 
      sign. This study demonstrates clinical relevance of PVS in FXTAS especially in 
      the basal ganglia region and suggests microangiopathy and dysfunctional 
      cerebrospinal fluid circulation in FXTAS physiopathology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by CGG repeat expansion of FMR1 gene. Both 
      FXTAS and neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) belong to polyglycine 
      diseases and present similar clinical, radiological, and pathological features, 
      making it difficult to distinguish these diseases. Reversible encephalitis-like 
      attacks are often observed in NIID. It is unclear whether they are presented in 
      FXTAS and can be used for differential diagnosis of NIID and FXTAS. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old Chinese male with late-onset gait disturbance, 
      cognitive decline, and reversible attacks of fever, consciousness impairment, 
      dizziness, vomiting, and urinary incontinence underwent neurological assessment 
      and examinations, including laboratory tests, electroencephalogram test, imaging, 
      skin biopsy, and genetic test. Brain MRI showed T2 hyperintensities in middle 
      cerebellar peduncle and cerebrum, in addition to cerebellar atrophy and DWI 
      hyperintensities along the corticomedullary junction. Lesions in the brainstem 
      were observed. Skin biopsy showed p62-positive intranuclear inclusions. The 
      possibilities of hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, epileptic seizures, and 
      cerebrovascular attacks were excluded. Genetic analysis revealed CGG repeat 
      expansion in FMR1 gene, and the number of repeats was 111. The patient was 
      finally diagnosed as FXTAS. He received supportive treatment as well as 
      symptomatic treatment during hospitalization. His encephalitic symptoms were 
      completely relieved within one week. CONCLUSIONS: This is a detailed report of a 
      case of FXTAS with reversible encephalitis-like episodes. This report provides 
      new information for the possible and rare features of FXTAS, highlighting that 
      encephalitis-like episodes are common in polyglycine diseases and unable to be 
      used for differential diagnosis.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable form of intellectual 
      disability and is caused by CGG repeat expansions exceeding 200 (full mutation). 
      Such expansions lead to hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of the 
      fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene. As a consequence, little or 
      no FMR1 protein (FMRP) is produced; absence of the protein, which normally is 
      responsible for neuronal development and maintenance, causes the syndrome. 
      Previous studies have demonstrated the causal relationship between FMRP levels 
      and cognitive abilities in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and dermal 
      fibroblast cell lines of patients with FXS. However, it is arguable whether PBMCs 
      or fibroblasts would be the preferred surrogate for measuring molecular markers, 
      particularly FMRP, to represent the cognitive impairment, a core symptom of FXS. 
      To address this concern, CGG repeats, methylation status, FMR1 mRNA, and FMRP 
      levels were measured in both PBMCs and fibroblasts derived from 66 individuals. 
      The findings indicated a strong association between FMR1 mRNA expression levels 
      and CGG repeat numbers in PBMCs of premutation males after correcting for 
      methylation status. Moreover, FMRP expression levels from both PBMCs and 
      fibroblasts of male participants with a hypermethylated full mutation and with 
      mosaicism demonstrated significant association between the intelligence quotient 
      levels and FMRP levels, suggesting that PBMCs may be preferable for FXS clinical 
      studies, because of their greater accessibility.

AB  - A GGGGCC (G4C2) hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 causes amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9ALS/FTD), while a CGG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in FMR1 leads to the neurodegenerative disorder 
      Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). These GC-rich repeats form 
      RNA secondary structures that support repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation 
      of toxic proteins that contribute to disease pathogenesis. Here we assessed 
      whether these same repeats might trigger stalling and interfere with 
      translational elongation. We find that depletion of ribosome-associated quality 
      control (RQC) factors NEMF, LTN1 and ANKZF1 markedly boost RAN translation 
      product accumulation from both G4C2 and CGG repeats while overexpression of these 
      factors reduces RAN production in both reporter assays and C9ALS/FTD patient 
      iPSC-derived neurons. We also detected partially made products from both G4C2 and 
      CGG repeats whose abundance increased with RQC factor depletion. Repeat RNA 
      sequence, rather than amino acid content, is central to the impact of RQC factor 
      depletion on RAN translation-suggesting a role for RNA secondary structure in 
      these processes. Together, these findings suggest that ribosomal stalling and RQC 
      pathway activation during RAN translation inhibits the generation of toxic RAN 
      products. We propose augmenting RQC activity as a therapeutic strategy in GC-rich 
      repeat expansion disorders.

AB  - The FMR1 5' regulation gene region harbors a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      (CGG-TRE) that causes Fragile X syndrome (FXS) when it expands to more than 200 
      repetitions. Ricaurte is a small village in southwestern Colombia, with an FXS 
      prevalence of 1 in 38 men and 1 in 100 women (~100 times higher than the 
      worldwide reported prevalence), defining Ricaurte as the largest FXS cluster in 
      the world. In the present study, using next-generation sequencing of whole exome 
      capture, we genotype 55 individuals from Ricaurte (49 with either full mutation 
      or with premutation), four individuals from neighboring villages (with either the 
      full mutation or with the premutation), and one unaffected woman, native of 
      Ricaurte, who did not belong to any of the affected families. With advanced 
      clustering and haplotype reconstruction, we modeled a common haplotype of 33 SNPs 
      spanning 83,567,899 bp and harboring the FMR1 gene. This reconstructed haplotype 
      was found in all the men from Ricaurte who carried the expansion, demonstrating 
      that the genetic conglomerate of FXS in this population is due to a founder 
      effect. The definition of this founder effect and its population outlining will 
      allow a better prediction, follow-up, precise and personalized characterization 
      of epidemiological parameters, better knowledge of the disease's natural history, 
      and confident improvement of the clinical attention, life quality, and health 
      interventions for this community.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a 
      neurodegenerative disease that affects carriers of a 55-200 CGG repeat expansion 
      in the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene, may be given an 
      incorrect initial diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) or essential tremor (ET) 
      due to overlapping motor symptoms. It is critical to characterize distinct 
      phenotypes in FXTAS compared to PD and ET to improve diagnostic accuracy. Fast as 
      possible (FP) speed and dual-task (DT) paradigms have the potential to 
      distinguish differences in gait performance between the three movement disorders. 
      Therefore, we sought to compare FXTAS, PD, and ET patients using quantitative 
      measures of functional mobility and gait under self-selected (SS) speed, FP, and 
      DT conditions. METHODS: Participants with FXTAS (n = 22), PD (n = 23), ET 
      (n = 20), and controls (n = 20) underwent gait testing with an inertial sensor 
      system (APDM()). An instrumented Timed Up and Go test (i-TUG) was used to 
      measure movement transitions, and a 2-min walk test (2MWT) was used to measure 
      gait and turn variables under SS, FP, and DT conditions, and dual-task costs 
      (DTC) were calculated. ANOVA and multinomial logistic regression analyses were 
      performed. RESULTS: PD participants had reduced stride lengths compared to FXTAS 
      and ET participants under SS and DT conditions, longer turn duration than ET 
      participants during the FP task, and less arm symmetry than ET participants in SS 
      gait. They also had greater DTC for stride length and velocity compared to FXTAS 
      participants. On the i-TUG, PD participants had reduced sit-to-stand peak 
      velocity compared to FXTAS and ET participants. Stride length and arm symmetry 
      index during the DT 2MWT was able to distinguish FXTAS and ET from PD, such that 
      participants with shorter stride lengths were more likely to have a diagnosis of 
      PD and those with greater arm asymmetry were more likely to be diagnosed with PD. 
      No gait or i-TUG parameters distinguished FXTAS from ET participants in the 
      regression model. CONCLUSION: This is the first quantitative study demonstrating 
      distinct gait and functional mobility profiles in FXTAS, PD, and ET which may 
      assist in more accurate and timely diagnosis.

AB  - Short tandem repeat (STR) instability causes transcriptional silencing in several 
      repeat expansion disorders. In fragile X syndrome (FXS), mutation-length 
      expansion of a CGG STR represses FMR1 via local DNA methylation. Here, we find 
      megabase-scale H3K9me3 domains on autosomes and encompassing FMR1 on the X 
      chromosome in FXS patient-derived iPSCs, iPSC-derived neural progenitors, 
      EBV-transformed lymphoblasts, and brain tissue with mutation-length CGG 
      expansion. H3K9me3 domains connect via inter-chromosomal interactions and 
      demarcate severe misfolding of TADs and loops. They harbor long synaptic genes 
      replicating at the end of S phase, replication-stress-induced double-strand 
      breaks, and STRs prone to stepwise somatic instability. CRISPR engineering of the 
      mutation-length CGG to premutation length reverses H3K9me3 on the X chromosome 
      and multiple autosomes, refolds TADs, and restores gene expression. H3K9me3 
      domains can also arise in normal-length iPSCs created with perturbations linked 
      to genome instability, suggesting their relevance beyond FXS. Our results reveal 
      Mb-scale heterochromatinization and trans interactions among loci susceptible to 
      instability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is primarily due to CGG repeat expansions in 
      the FMR1 gene. FMR1 alleles are classified as normal (N), intermediate (I), 
      premutation (PM), and full mutation (FM). FXS patients often carry an FM, but 
      size mosaicism can occur. Additionally, loss of methylation boundary upstream of 
      repeats results in de novo methylation spreading to FMR1 promoter in FXS 
      patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This pilot study investigated the 
      methylation boundary and adjacent regions in 66 males with typical and atypical 
      FXS aged 1 to 30 years (10.86 +/- 6.48 years). AmplideX FMR1 mPCR kit was used to 
      discriminate allele profiles and methylation levels. CpG sites were assessed by 
      pyrosequencing. RESULTS: 40 out of 66 FXS patients (60.6%) showed an exclusive FM 
      (n = 40), whereas the remaining (n = 26) exhibited size mosaicism [10 PM_FM 
      (15.15%); 10 N_FM (15.15%); 2 N_PM_FM (3%)]. Four patients (6.1%) had deletions 
      near repeats. Noteworthy, a CpG within FMR1 intron 2 displayed hypomethylation in 
      FXS patients and hypermethylation in controls, demonstrating remarkable 
      specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy when a methylation threshold of 69.5% was 
      applied. CONCLUSIONS: Since intragenic methylation is pivotal in gene regulation, 
      the intronic CpG might be a novel epigenetic biomarker for FXS diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a leading cause of autism spectrum 
      disorder (ASD) and resulted from a loss of the FMR1-encoded fragile X messenger 
      ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP) protein due to large CGG repeat expansions in the 
      promoter region of the FMR1 gene. The microtubule-associated protein Tau is a 
      promising target for Tauopathic diseases and our preliminary study found that Tau 
      protein levels were increased in the brain of Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice, a model of 
      FXS. However, whether Tau reduction can prevent autism-like features in Fmr1 KO 
      mice and become a novel strategy for FXS treatment remain unknown. METHODS: Tau 
      was genetically reduced in Fmr1 KO mice through crossing Fmr1(+/-) female mice with 
      Mapt(+/-) male mice. The male offspring with different genotypes were subjected to 
      various autism-related behavioral tests, RNA sequencing, and biochemical 
      analysis. Fmr1 KO male mice were treated with Tau-targeting antisense 
      oligonucleotide (ASO) and then subjected to behavioral tests and biochemical 
      analysis. RESULTS: Tau expression was increased in the cortex of Fmr1 KO mice. 
      Genetically reducing Tau prevented social defects, stereotyped and repetitive 
      behavior, and spine abnormality in Fmr1 KO mice. Tau reduction also reversed 
      increased periodic activity and partially rescued Per1 expression reduction in 
      Fmr1 KO mice. Moreover, Tau reduction reversed compromised P38/MAPK signaling in 
      Fmr1 KO mice. Finally, Tau-targeting ASO also effectively alleviated autism-like 
      phenotypes and promoted P38/MAPK signaling in Fmr1 KO mice. LIMITATIONS: Our 
      study is limited to male mice, in agreement with the higher incidence of FXS in 
      males than females. Whether Tau reduction also exerts protection in females 
      deserves further scrutiny. Moreover, although Tau reduction rescues impaired 
      P38/MAPK signaling in Fmr1 KO mice, whether this is the responsible molecular 
      mechanism requires further determination. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that Tau 
      reduction prevents autism-like phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice. Tau may become a new 
      target for FXS treatment.

TI  - The Frequency of Intermediate Alleles in Patients with Cerebellar Phenotypes.
PG  - 1135-1145
LID - 10.1007/s12311-023-01620-7 [doi]
AB  - Cerebellar syndromes are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and can be 
      classified as hereditary, neurodegenerative non-hereditary, or acquired. Few data 
      are available on the frequency of each form in the clinical setting. Growing 
      interest is emerging regarding the genetic forms caused by triplet repeat 
      expansions. Alleles with repeat expansion lower than the pathological threshold, 
      termed intermediate alleles (IAs), have been found to be associated with disease 
      manifestation. In order to assess the relevance of IAs as a cause of cerebellar 
      syndromes, we enrolled 66 unrelated Italian ataxic patients and described the 
      distribution of the different etiology of their syndromes and the frequency of 
      IAs. Each patient underwent complete clinical, hematological, and 
      neurophysiological assessments, neuroimaging evaluations, and genetic tests for 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (SCA) and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome (FXTAS). We identified the following diagnostic categories: 28% sporadic 
      adult-onset ataxia, 18% cerebellar variant of multiple system atrophy, 9% 
      acquired forms, 9% genetic forms with full-range expansion, and 12% cases with 
      intermediate-range expansion. The IAs were six in the FMR1 gene, two in the gene 
      responsible for SCA8, and one in the ATXN2 gene. The clinical phenotype of 
      patients carrying the IAs resembles, in most of the cases, the one associated 
      with full-range expansion. Our study provides an exhaustive description of the 
      causes of cerebellar ataxia, estimating for the first time the frequency of IAs 
      in SCAs- and FXTAS-associated genes. The high percentage of cases with IAs 
      supports further screening among patients with cerebellar syndromes.

TI  - Trehalose consumption ameliorates pathogenesis in an inducible mouse model of the 
      Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome.
PG  - 826-835
LID - 10.1080/1028415X.2023.2261682 [doi]
AB  - Trehalose is a naturally occurring sugar found in various food and pharmaceutical 
      preparations with the ability to enhance cellular proteostasis and reduce the 
      formation of toxic intracellular protein aggregates, making it a promising 
      therapeutic candidate for various neurodegenerative disorders. OBJECTIVES: Here, 
      we explored the effectiveness of nutritional trehalose supplementation in 
      ameliorating symptoms in a mouse model of Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome (FXTAS), an incurable late onset manifestation of moderately expanded 
      trinucleotide CGG repeat expansion mutations in the 5' untranslated region of the 
      fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 gene (FMR1). METHODS: An inducible mouse 
      model of FXTAS expressing 90 CGG repeats in the brain had been previously 
      developed, which faithfully captures hallmarks of the disorder, the formation of 
      intracellular inclusions, and the disturbance of motor function. Taking advantage 
      of the inducible nature of the model, we investigated the therapeutic potential 
      of orally administered trehalose under two regimens, modelling disease prevention 
      and disease treatment. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Trehalose's effectiveness in 
      combating protein aggregation is frequently attributed to its ability to induce 
      autophagy. Accordingly, trehalose supplementation under the prevention regimen 
      ameliorated the formation of intranuclear inclusions and improved the motor 
      deficiencies resulting from the induced expression of 90 CGG repeats, but it 
      failed to reverse the existing nuclear pathology as a treatment strategy. Given 
      the favorable safety profile of trehalose, it is promising to further explore the 
      potential of this agent for early stage FXTAS.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) [OMIM 300624] is a common X-linked inherited syndrome 
      with an incidence only second to that of trisomy 21. More than 95% of fragile X 
      syndrome is caused by reduced or absent fragile X intellectual disability protein 
      1 (FMRP) synthesis due to dynamic mutation expansion of the CGG triplet repeat in 
      the 5'UTR and abnormal methylation of the FMR1 (fragile X messenger 
      ribonucleoprotein 1) gene [OMIM 309550]. Less than 5% of cases are caused by 
      abnormal function of the FMRP due to point mutations or deletions in the FMR1 
      gene. In a proband with clinical suspicion of FXS and no CGG duplication, we 
      found the presence of c.585_586del (p.Lys195AsnfsTer8) in exon 7 of the FMR1 gene 
      using whole exome sequencing (WES). This variant resulted in frameshift and a 
      premature stop codon after 8 aberrant amino acids. This variant is a novel 
      pathogenic mutation, as determined by pedigree analysis, which has not been 
      reported in any database or literature.

AB  - Expansion of a CGG repeat in the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) 
      gene on the X chromosome is the cause of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). The repeat 
      length of unaffected individuals varies between 5-40 repeats, whereas >200 
      repeats are observed in cases of FXS. The intermediate range between 55-200 
      repeats is considered the premutation range and is observed in roughly 1:300 
      females and 1:900 males in the general population. With the availability of 
      large-scale whole genome sequence (WGS) data and the development of computational 
      tools to detect repeat expansions, we systematically examined the role of FMR1 
      premutation alleles in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) susceptibility, assess the 
      prevalence, and consider the allelic stability between parents and offspring. We 
      analyzed the WGS data of 22,053 subjects, including 32 FXS positive controls, 
      1359 population controls, and 5467 ASD families. We observed no FMR1 full 
      mutation range repeats among the ASD parent-offspring families but identified 180 
      family members with premutation range alleles, which represents a higher 
      prevalence compared to the independent WGS control sample and previous reports in 
      the literature. A sex-specific analysis between probands and unaffected siblings 
      did not reveal a significant increase in the burden of premutation alleles in 
      either males or females with ASD. PCR validation, however, suggests an 
      overestimation of the frequency of FMR1 premutation range alleles through 
      computational analysis of WGS data. Overall, we show the utility of large-scale 
      repeat expansion screening in WGS data and conclude that there is no apparent 
      evidence of FMR1 premutation alleles contributing to ASD susceptibility.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is controversial evidence that FMR1 premutation or "gray zone" 
      (GZ) allele (small CGG expansion, 45-54 repeats) was associated with Parkinson's 
      disease (PD). We aimed to explore further the association between FMR1 CGG repeat 
      expansions and PD in a large sample of Chinese origin. METHODS: We included a 
      cohort of 2,362 PD patients and 1,072 controls from the Parkinson's Disease and 
      Movement Disorders Multicenter Database and Collaborative Network in China 
      (PD-MDCNC) in this study and conducted repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction 
      (RP-PCR) for the size of FMR1 CGG repeat expansions. RESULTS: Two PD patients 
      were detected with FMR1 premutation (61 and 56 repeats), and the other eleven PD 
      patients were detected with the GZ allele of FMR1 CGG repeat expansions. Those 
      thirteen PD patients responded well to levodopa and were diagnosed with 
      clinically established PD. Specifically, one female PD patient with GZ allele was 
      also found with premature ovarian failure. However, compared to healthy controls, 
      we found no significant enrichment of GZ allele carriers in PD patients or other 
      subgroups of PD cases, including the subgroups of female, male, early-onset, and 
      late-onset PD patients. Furthermore, we did not find any correlation between the 
      FMR1 gene CGG repeat sizes and age at onset of PD. CONCLUSION: It suggested that 
      FMR1 premutation was related to PD, but the GZ allele of FMR1 CGG repeat 
      expansions was not significantly enriched in PD cases of Chinese origin. Further 
      larger multiple ethnic studies are needed to determine further the role of the 
      FMR1 GZ allele in PD.

TI  - Cochlear Nucleus Transcriptome of a Fragile X Mouse Model Reveals Candidate Genes 
      for Hyperacusis.
PG  - 1363-1371

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a hereditary form of autism spectrum 
      disorder. It is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the Fmr1 gene, 
      leading to a loss of Fragile X Protein (FMRP) expression. The loss of FMRP causes 
      auditory hypersensitivity: FXS patients display hyperacusis and the Fmr1- 
      knock-out (KO) mouse model for FXS exhibits auditory seizures. FMRP is strongly 
      expressed in the cochlear nucleus and other auditory brainstem nuclei. We 
      hypothesize that the Fmr1-KO mouse has altered gene expression in the cochlear 
      nucleus that may contribute to auditory hypersensitivity. METHODS: RNA was 
      isolated from cochlear nuclei of Fmr1-KO and WT mice. Using next-generation 
      sequencing (RNA-seq), the transcriptomes of Fmr1-KO mice and WT mice (n = 3 each) 
      were compared and analyzed using gene ontology programs. RESULTS: We identified 
      270 unique, differentially expressed genes between Fmr1-KO and WT cochlear 
      nuclei. Upregulated genes (67%) are enriched in those encoding secreted 
      molecules. Downregulated genes (33%) are enriched in neuronal function, including 
      synaptic pathways, some of which are ideal candidate genes that may contribute to 
      hyperacusis. CONCLUSION: The loss of FMRP can affect the expression of genes in 
      the cochlear nucleus that are important for neuronal signaling. One of these, 
      Kcnab2, which encodes a subunit of the Shaker voltage-gated potassium channel, is 
      expressed at an abnormally low level in the Fmr1-KO cochlear nucleus. Kcnab2 and 
      other differentially expressed genes may represent pathways for the development 
      of hyperacusis. Future studies will be aimed at investigating the effects of 
      these altered genes on hyperacusis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A Laryngoscope,

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disease with intellectual 
      disabilities. FXS is often caused by the CGG-repeat expansion mutation in the 
      FMR1 gene with suppressed FMR1 transcription and decreased protein levels in the 
      brain of the patients. The RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 system is a promising targeted 
      genomic editing tool in gene therapy of FXS. In order to evaluate its 
      feasibility, the present study used CRISPR/Cas9 system to target the FMR1 5'-UTR 
      sites in cultured human neuroblastoma cells. METHODS: PCR and DNA clone were used 
      to construct plasmids. CRISPR function was tested by Western blot and flow 
      cytometry. Data were analyzed by a two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test using 
      GraphPad software. This research was conducted from 2020 to 2022 in the Second 
      Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. RESULTS: Cell cycle 
      analysis showed significant differences in G1, S and G2/M phases between the two 
      groups (P<0.05). In the knockout cells, apoptosis was accelerated (P<0.05) with a 
      significantly down-regulated (P<0.05) expression of FMRP as compared with the 
      control group. CONCLUSION: This study provides further understanding about the 
      FMRP function and molecular mechanism of FMR1 gene in nerve cells, and suggests 
      the feasibility of gene therapy in FXS by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system.

TI  - A Postmortem MRI Study of Cerebrovascular Disease and Iron Content at End-Stage

AB  - Brain changes at the end-stage of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS) are largely unknown due to mobility impairment. We conducted a postmortem 
      MRI study of FXTAS to quantify cerebrovascular disease, brain atrophy and iron 
      content, and examined their relationships using principal component analysis 
      (PCA). Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) was observed in 4/17 FXTAS cases, among 
      which one was confirmed by histologic staining. Compared with seven control 
      brains, FXTAS cases showed higher ratings of T2-hyperintensities (indicating 
      cerebral small vessel disease) in the cerebellum, globus pallidus and 
      frontoparietal white matter, and significant atrophy in the cerebellar white 
      matter, red nucleus and dentate nucleus. PCA of FXTAS cases revealed negative 
      associations of T2-hyperintensity ratings with anatomic volumes and iron content 
      in the white matter, hippocampus and amygdala, that were independent from a 
      highly correlated number of regions with ICH and iron content in subcortical 
      nuclei. Post-hoc analysis confirmed PCA findings and further revealed increased 
      iron content in the white matter, hippocampus and amygdala in FXTAS cases 
      compared to controls, after adjusting for T2-hyperintensity ratings. These 
      findings indicate that both ischemic and hemorrhagic brain damage may occur in 
      FXTAS, with the former being marked by demyelination/iron depletion and atrophy, 
      and the latter by ICH and iron accumulation in basal ganglia.

AB  - Aberrant alternative splicing of mRNAs results in dysregulated gene expression in 
      multiple neurological disorders. Here, we show that hundreds of mRNAs are 
      incorrectly expressed and spliced in white blood cells and brain tissues of 
      individuals with fragile X syndrome (FXS). Surprisingly, the FMR1 (Fragile X 
      Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1) gene is transcribed in >70% of the FXS tissues. In 
      all FMR1-expressing FXS tissues, FMR1 RNA itself is mis-spliced in a CGG 
      expansion-dependent manner to generate the little-known FMR1-217 RNA isoform, 
      which is comprised of FMR1 exon 1 and a pseudo-exon in intron 1. FMR1-217 is also 
      expressed in FXS premutation carrier-derived skin fibroblasts and brain tissues. 
      We show that in cells aberrantly expressing mis-spliced FMR1, antisense 
      oligonucleotide (ASO) treatment reduces FMR1-217, rescues full-length FMR1 RNA, 
      and restores FMRP (Fragile X Messenger RibonucleoProtein) to normal levels. 
      Notably, FMR1 gene reactivation in transcriptionally silent FXS cells using 
      5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AzadC), which prevents DNA methylation, increases 
      FMR1-217 RNA levels but not FMRP. ASO treatment of cells prior to 5-AzadC 
      application rescues full-length FMR1 expression and restores FMRP. These findings 
      indicate that misregulated RNA-processing events in blood could serve as potent 
      biomarkers for FXS and that in those individuals expressing FMR1-217, ASO 
      treatment may offer a therapeutic approach to mitigate the disorder.

AB  - Neurodegeneration in Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is 
      caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of FMR1. Expanded 
      CGG repeat RNAs form stable secondary structures, which in turn support 
      repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation to produce toxic peptides. The 
      parameters that impact RAN translation initiation efficiency are not well 
      understood. Here we used a Drosophila melanogaster model of FXTAS to evaluate the 
      role of the eIF4G family of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (EIF4G1, 
      EIF4GII and EIF4G2/DAP5) in modulating RAN translation and CGG repeat-associated 
      toxicity. DAP5 knockdown robustly suppressed CGG repeat-associated toxicity and 
      inhibited RAN translation. Furthermore, knockdown of initiation factors that 
      preferentially associate with DAP5 (such as EIF2beta, EIF3F and EIF3G) also 
      selectively suppressed CGG repeat-induced eye degeneration. In mammalian cellular 
      reporter assays, DAP5 knockdown exhibited modest and cell-type specific effects 
      on RAN translation. Taken together, these data support a role for DAP5 in CGG 
      repeat associated toxicity possibly through modulation of RAN translation.

PG  - 1975-1987

AB  - Women with the FMR1 premutation are susceptible to motor involvement related to 
      atypical cerebellar function, including risk for developing fragile X tremor 
      ataxia syndrome. Vocal quality analyses are sensitive to subtle differences in 
      motor skills but have not yet been applied to the FMR1 premutation. This study 
      examined whether women with the FMR1 premutation demonstrate differences in vocal 
      quality, and whether such differences relate to FMR1 genetic, executive, motor, 
      or health features of the FMR1 premutation. Participants included 35 women with 
      the FMR1 premutation and 45 age-matched women without the FMR1 premutation who 
      served as a comparison group. Three sustained /a/ vowels were analyzed for pitch 
      (mean F0), variability of pitch (standard deviation of F0), and overall vocal 
      quality (jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio). Executive, motor, and 
      health indices were obtained from direct and self-report measures and genetic 
      samples were analyzed for FMR1 CGG repeat length and activation ratio. Women with 
      the FMR1 premutation had a lower pitch, larger pitch variability, and poorer 
      vocal quality than the comparison group. Working memory was related to 
      harmonics-to-noise ratio and shimmer in women with the FMR1 premutation. Vocal 
      quality abnormalities differentiated women with the FMR1 premutation from the 
      comparison group and were evident even in the absence of other clinically evident 
      motor deficits. This study supports vocal quality analyses as a tool that may 
      prove useful in the detection of early signs of motor involvement in this 
      population.

AB  - Here, we describe an approach to correct the genetic defect in fragile X syndrome 
      (FXS) via recruitment of endogenous repair mechanisms. A leading cause of autism 
      spectrum disorders, FXS results from epigenetic silencing of FMR1 due to a 
      congenital trinucleotide (CGG) repeat expansion. By investigating conditions 
      favorable to FMR1 reactivation, we find MEK and BRAF inhibitors that induce a 
      strong repeat contraction and full FMR1 reactivation in cellular models. We trace 
      the mechanism to DNA demethylation and site-specific R-loops, which are necessary 
      and sufficient for repeat contraction. A positive feedback cycle comprising 
      demethylation, de novo FMR1 transcription, and R-loop formation results in the 
      recruitment of endogenous DNA repair mechanisms that then drive excision of the 
      long CGG repeat. Repeat contraction is specific to FMR1 and restores the 
      production of FMRP protein. Our study therefore identifies a potential method of 
      treating FXS in the future.

TI  - An escalating continuum of learning and attention difficulties from premutation 
      to full mutation in female carriers of FMR1 expansion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Carriers of Fragile X premutation may have associated medical 
      comorbidities, such as Fragile X-associated tremor and ataxia (FXTAS) and Fragile 
      X-associated premature ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). We examined the Fragile X 
      premutation effect on cognition, and we assumed that there is a direct 
      correlation between the continuous spectrum of specific learning and attention 
      deficits to the number of CGG repeats on the FMR1 gene. METHODS: A total of 108 
      women were referred to our center due to a related Fragile X syndrome (FXS) 
      patient, 79 women carried a premutation of 56-199 repeats, and 19 women carried a 
      full mutation of more than 200 CGG repeats on FMR1 gene. Genetic results of CGG 
      repeats, demographic information, structured questionnaires for ADHD, learning 
      disabilities of language and mathematics, and independence level were analyzed in 
      women carrying the FMR1 premutation and compared to the group carrying the full 
      mutation. Women with FXS and FXTAS were excluded. RESULTS: When analyzed as a 
      continuum, there was a significant increase in the following complaints which 
      were associated with a higher number of repeats: specific daily function skills 
      such as driving a car, writing checks, disorientation in directions, and also 
      specific learning difficulties such as spelling and math difficulties. 
      Additionally, when tested as a categorical independent variable, we observe that 
      women with the full mutation were more likely to have ADHD or other learning 
      disability diagnoses in the past than during premutation (<200 CGG repetitions). 
      CONCLUSION: Specific learning and attention difficulties and resulting daily 
      function difficulties correlate with an increased number of CGG repeats and are 
      more likely to be associated as a common feature of premutation and full mutation 
      in a female premutation carrier. Despite evidence of learning and attention 
      difficulties, it is encouraging that most female carriers of the premutation and 
      full mutation function well in most areas. Nevertheless, they face significant 
      difficulties in specific areas of functioning such as driving, and confusion in 
      times and schedules. Those daily function skills are mostly impacted by 
      dyscalculia, right and left disorientation, and attention difficulties. This may 
      aid to design specific interventions to address specific learning deficits in 
      order to improve daily function skills and quality of life.

AB  - Pathogenic short tandem repeat (STR) expansions cause over 20 neurodegenerative 
      diseases. To determine the contribution of STRs in sporadic amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), we used ExpansionHunter, 
      REviewer, and polymerase chain reaction validation to assess 21 neurodegenerative 
      disease-associated STRs in whole-genome sequencing data from 608 patients with 
      sporadic ALS, 68 patients with sporadic FTD, and 4703 matched controls. We also 
      propose a data-derived outlier detection method for defining allele thresholds in 
      rare STRs. Excluding C9orf72 repeat expansions, 17.6% of clinically diagnosed ALS 
      and FTD cases had at least one expanded STR allele reported to be pathogenic or 
      intermediate for another neurodegenerative disease. We identified and validated 
      162 disease-relevant STR expansions in C9orf72 (ALS/FTD), ATXN1 [spinal 
      cerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1)], ATXN2 (SCA2), ATXN8 (SCA8), TBP (SCA17), HTT 
      (Huntington's disease), DMPK [myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)], CNBP (DM2), and 
      FMR1 (fragile-X disorders). Our findings suggest clinical and pathological 
      pleiotropy of neurodegenerative disease genes and highlight their importance in 
      ALS and FTD.

AB  - Carriers of a premutation allele (PM) in the FMR1 gene are at risk of developing 
      a number of Fragile X premutation asssociated disorders (FXPAC), 
      including Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), Fragile 
      X-associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI), and Fragile X-associated 
      neuropsychiatric disorders (FXAND). We have recently reported somatic CGG allele 
      expansion in female PM; however, its clinical significance remains unclear. The 
      aim of this study was to examine the potential clinical association between 
      somatic FMR1 allele instability and PM associated disorders. Participants 
      comprised of 424 female PM carriers age 0.3- 90 years. FMR1 molecular measures 
      and clinical information on the presence of medical conditions, were determined 
      for all subjects for primary analysis. Two sub-groups of participants (age >/= 25, 
      N = 377 and age >/= 50, N = 134) were used in the analysis related to presence of 
      FXPOI and FXTAS, respectively. Among all participants (N = 424), the degree of 
      instability (expansion) was significantly higher (median 2.5 vs 2.0, P = 0.026) 
      in participants with a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
      (ADHD) compared to those without. FMR1 mRNA expression was significantly higher 
      in subjects with any psychiatric disorder diagnosis (P = 0.0017); specifically, 
      in those with ADHD (P = 0.009), and with depression (P = 0.025). Somatic FMR1 
      expansion was associated with the presence of ADHD in female PM and FMR1 mRNA 
      levels were associated with the presence of mental health disorders. The findings 
      of our research are innovative as they suggest a potential role of the CGG 
      expansion in the clinical phenotype of PM and may potentially guide clinical 
      prognosis and management.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited intellectual disability. 
      FXS is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region 
      of the FMR1 gene, which leads to gene methylation, transcriptional silencing, and 
      lack of expression of Fragile X Messenger Riboprotein (FMRP). Currently available 
      FXS therapies are inefficient, and the disease severity is highly variable, 
      making it difficult to predict disease trajectory and treatment response. We and 
      others have recently shown that a subset of full-mutation, fully-methylated 
      (FM-FM) males with FXS express low amounts of FMRP which could contribute to 
      phenotypic variability. To better understand the underlying mechanisms, we 
      developed a sensitive qRT-PCR assay to detect FMR1 mRNA in blood. This assay 
      reproducibly detects trace amounts of FMR1 mRNA in a subset of FM-FM males, 
      suggesting that current Southern Blot and PCR determination of FM-FM status is 
      not always associated with complete transcriptional silencing. The functional 
      relevance of trace-level FMR1 mRNA is confirmed by showing a positive correlation 
      with cognitive function; however, phenotypic variability is not fully explained 
      by FMR1 expression. These results corroborate the need for better molecular 
      assays for FXS diagnosis and encourage studies to elucidate the factors 
      contributing to the phenotypic variability of FXS.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is rare genetic condition characterized by 
      a repeat expansion (CGG) in the Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) 
      gene where individuals with greater than 200 repeats are defined as full 
      mutation. FXS clinical presentation often includes intellectual disability, and 
      autism-like symptoms, including anxiety and sensory hypersensitivities. 
      Individuals with 55 to <200 CGG repeats are said to have the FMR1 premutation, 
      which is not associated with primary characteristics of the full mutation, but 
      with an increased risk for anxiety, depression, and other affective conditions, 
      as well as and impaired cognitive processing differences that vary in severity. 
      Defining subgroups of premutation carriers based on distinct biological features 
      may identify subgroups with varying levels of psychiatric, cognitive, and 
      behavioral alterations. METHODS: The current pilot study utilized 3 cluster 
      subgroupings defined by previous k means cluster analysis on neuropsychiatric, 
      cognitive, and resting EEG variables in order to examine basic sensory auditory 
      chirp task-based EEG parameters from 33 females with the FMR1 premutation (ages 
      17-78). RESULTS: Based on the predefined, neuropsychiatric three-cluster 
      solution, premutation carriers with increased neuropsychiatric features and 
      higher CGG repeat counts (cluster 1) showed decreased stimulus onset response, 
      similar to previous ERP findings across a number of psychiatric disorders but 
      opposite to findings in individuals with full mutation FXS. Premutation carriers 
      with increased executive dysfunction and resting gamma power (cluster 2) 
      exhibited decreased gamma phase locking to a chirp stimulus, similar to 
      individuals with full mutation FXS. Cluster 3 members, who were relatively 
      unaffected by psychiatric or cognitive symptoms, showed the most normative 
      task-based EEG metrics. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest a spectrum of sensory 
      processing characteristics present in subgroups of premutation carriers that have 
      been previously understudied due to lack of overall group differences. Our 
      findings also further validate the pre-defined clinical subgroups by supporting 
      links between disturbances in well-defined neural pathways and behavioral 
      alterations that may be informative for identifying the mechanisms supporting 
      specific risk factors and divergent therapeutic needs in individuals with the 
      FMR1 premutation.

TI  - Evidence for a fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) mRNA 
      gain-of-function toxicity mechanism contributing to the pathogenesis of fragile 
      X-associated premature ovarian insufficiency.
PG  - e22612

AB  - Fragile X-associated premature ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) is among a family of 
      disorders caused by expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat sequence located in 
      the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 
      (FMR1) gene on the X chromosome. Women with FXPOI have a depleted ovarian 
      follicle population, resulting in amenorrhea, hypoestrogenism, and loss of 
      fertility before the age of 40. FXPOI is caused by expansions of the CGG sequence 
      to lengths between 55 and 200 repeats, known as a FMRI premutation, however the 
      mechanism by which the premutation drives disease pathogenesis remains unclear. 
      Two main hypotheses exist, which describe an mRNA toxic gain-of-function 
      mechanism or a protein-based mechanism, where repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) 
      translation results in the production of an abnormal protein, called FMRpolyG. 
      Here, we have developed an in vitro granulosa cell model of the FMR1 premutation 
      by ectopically expressing CGG-repeat RNA and FMRpolyG protein. We show that 
      expanded CGG-repeat RNA accumulated in intranuclear RNA structures, and these 
      aggregates were able to cause significant granulosa cell death independent of 
      FMRpolyG expression. Using an innovative RNA pulldown, mass spectrometry-based 
      approach we have identified proteins that are specifically sequestered by CGG RNA 
      aggregates in granulosa cells in vitro, and thus may be deregulated as 
      consequence of this interaction. Furthermore, we have demonstrated reduced 
      expression of three proteins identified via our RNA pulldown (FUS, PA2G4 and 
      TRA2beta) in ovarian follicles in a FMR1 premutation mouse model. Collectively, 
      these data provide evidence for the contribution of an mRNA gain-of-function 
      mechanism to FXPOI disease biology.

      ataxias for over 20 years. Routine genetic diagnostics of these phenotypically 
      similar diseases still rely on an iterative workflow for quantification of repeat 
      units by PCR-based methods of limited precision. We established and validated 
      clinical nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing, an amplification-free method for 
      simultaneous analysis of 10 repeat loci associated with clinically overlapping 
      hereditary ataxias. The method combines target enrichment by CRISPR-Cas9, Oxford 
      Nanopore long-read sequencing and a bioinformatics pipeline using the tools 
      STRique and Megalodon for parallel detection of length, sequence, methylation and 
      composition of the repeat loci. Clinical nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing 
      allowed for the precise and parallel analysis of 10 repeat loci associated with 
      adult-onset ataxia and revealed additional parameter such as FMR1 promotor 
      methylation and repeat sequence required for diagnosis at the same time. Using 
      clinical nanopore Cas9-targeted sequencing we analysed 100 clinical samples of 
      undiagnosed ataxia patients and identified causative repeat expansions in 28 
      patients. Parallel repeat analysis enabled a molecular diagnosis of ataxias 
      independent of preconceptions on the basis of clinical presentation. Biallelic 
      expansions within RFC1 were identified as the most frequent cause of ataxia. We 
      characterized the RFC1 repeat composition of all patients and identified a novel 
      repeat motif, AGGGG. Our results highlight the power of clinical nanopore 
      Cas9-targeted sequencing as a readily expandable workflow for the in-depth 
      analysis and diagnosis of phenotypically overlapping repeat expansion disorders.

TI  - Connective Tissue Disorders and Fragile X Molecular Status in Females: A Case 
      Series and Review.

LID - 9090
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual 
      disabilities and the second most common cause after Down syndrome. FXS is an 
      X-linked disorder due to a full mutation of the CGG triplet repeat of the FMR1 
      gene which codes for a protein that is crucial in synaptogenesis and maintaining 
      functions of extracellular matrix-related proteins, key for the development of 
      normal neuronal and connective tissue including collagen. In addition to 
      neuropsychiatric and behavioral problems, individuals with FXS show physical 
      features suggestive of a connective tissue disorder including loose skin and 
      joint laxity, flat feet, hernias and mitral valve prolapse. Disturbed collagen 
      leads to hypermobility, hyperextensible skin and tissue fragility with 
      musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, immune and other organ involvement as seen in 
      hereditary disorders of connective tissue including Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. 
      Recently, FMR1 premutation repeat expansion or carrier status has been reported 
      in individuals with connective tissue disorder-related symptoms. We examined a 
      cohort of females with features of a connective tissue disorder presenting for 
      genetic services using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a connective tissue 
      disorder gene panel consisting of approximately 75 genes. In those females with 
      normal NGS testing for connective tissue disorders, the FMR1 gene was then 
      analyzed using CGG repeat expansion studies. Three of thirty-nine females were 
      found to have gray zone or intermediate alleles at a 1:13 ratio which was 
      significantly higher (p < 0.05) when compared with newborn females representing 
      the general population at a 1:66 ratio. This association of connective tissue 
      involvement in females with intermediate or gray zone alleles reported for the 
      first time will require more studies on how the size variation may impact FMR1 
      gene function and protein directly or in relationship with other susceptibility 
      genes involved in connective tissue disorders.

TI  - 341 Repeats Is Not Enough for Methylation in a New Fragile X Mouse Model.
LID - ENEURO.0142-22.2022 [pii]

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a leading monogenic cause of intellectual disability 
      and autism spectrum disorders, spurring decades of intense research and a 
      multitude of mouse models. So far, these models do not recapitulate the genetic 
      underpinning of classical FXS-CGG repeat-induced methylation of the Fmr1 
      locus-and their findings have failed to translate into the clinic. We sought to 
      answer whether this disparity was because of low repeat length and generated a 
      novel mouse line with 341 repeats, Fmr1(hs341) , which is the largest allele in 
      mice reported to date. This repeat length is significantly longer than the 200 
      repeats generally required for methylation of the repeat tract and promoter 
      region in FXS patients, which leads to silencing of the FMR1 gene. Bisulfite 
      sequencing fails to detect the robust methylation expected of FXS in Fmr1(hs341) 
      mice. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting results also do not 
      resemble FXS and instead produce a biochemical profile consistent with the 
      fragile X-associated premutation disorders. These findings suggest that repeat 
      length is unlikely to be the core determinant preventing methylation in mice, and 
      other organisms phylogenetically closer to humans may be required to effectively 
      model FXS.

TI  - REViewer: haplotype-resolved visualization of read alignments in and around 
      tandem repeats.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Expansions of short tandem repeats are the cause of many neurogenetic 
      disorders including familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington disease, 
      and many others. Multiple methods have been recently developed that can identify 
      repeat expansions in whole genome or exome sequencing data. Despite the widely 
      recognized need for visual assessment of variant calls in clinical settings, 
      current computational tools lack the ability to produce such visualizations for 
      repeat expansions. Expanded repeats are difficult to visualize because they 
      correspond to large insertions relative to the reference genome and involve many 
      misaligning and ambiguously aligning reads. RESULTS: We implemented REViewer, a 
      computational method for visualization of sequencing data in genomic regions 
      containing long repeat expansions and FlipBook, a companion image viewer designed 
      for manual curation of large collections of REViewer images. To generate a read 
      pileup, REViewer reconstructs local haplotype sequences and distributes reads to 
      these haplotypes in a way that is most consistent with the fragment lengths and 
      evenness of read coverage. To create appropriate training materials for 
      onboarding new users, we performed a concordance study involving 12 scientists 
      involved in short tandem repeat research. We used the results of this study to 
      create a user guide that describes the basic principles of using REViewer as well 
      as a guide to the typical features of read pileups that correspond to low 
      confidence repeat genotype calls. Additionally, we demonstrated that REViewer can 
      be used to annotate clinically relevant repeat interruptions by comparing visual 
      assessment results of 44 FMR1 repeat alleles with the results of triplet repeat 
      primed PCR. For 38 of these alleles, the results of visual assessment were 
      consistent with triplet repeat primed PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Read pileup plots 
      generated by REViewer offer an intuitive way to visualize sequencing data in 
      regions containing long repeat expansions. Laboratories can use REViewer and 
      FlipBook to assess the quality of repeat genotype calls as well as to visually 
      detect interruptions or other imperfections in the repeat sequence and the 
      surrounding flanking regions. REViewer and FlipBook are available under 
      open-source licenses at https://github.com/illumina/REViewer and 
      https://github.com/broadinstitute/flipbook respectively.

AB  - CGG repeat expansions in the FMR1 5'UTR cause the neurodegenerative disease 
      Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). These repeats form stable 
      RNA secondary structures that support aberrant translation in the absence of an 
      AUG start codon (RAN translation), producing aggregate-prone peptides that 
      accumulate within intranuclear neuronal inclusions and contribute to 
      neurotoxicity. Here, we show that the most abundant RAN translation product, 
      FMRpolyG, is markedly less toxic when generated from a construct with a 
      non-repetitive alternating codon sequence in place of the CGG repeat. While 
      exploring the mechanism of this differential toxicity, we observed a +1 
      translational frameshift within the CGG repeat from the arginine to glycine 
      reading frame. Frameshifts occurred within the first few translated repeats and 
      were triggered predominantly by RNA sequence and structural features. Short 
      chimeric R/G peptides form aggregates distinct from those formed by either pure 
      arginine or glycine, and these chimeras induce toxicity in cultured rodent 
      neurons. Together, this work suggests that CGG repeats support translational 
      frameshifting and that chimeric RAN translated peptides may contribute to CGG 
      repeat-associated toxicity in FXTAS and related disorders.

AB  - The fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene contains an expansion-prone CGG 
      repeat within its 5' UTR. Alleles with 55-200 repeats are known as premutation 
      (PM) alleles and confer risk for one or more of the FMR1 premutation (PM) 
      disorders that include Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), 
      Fragile X-associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI), and Fragile 
      X-Associated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (FXAND). PM alleles expand on 
      intergenerational transmission, with the children of PM mothers being at risk of 
      inheriting alleles with > 200 CGG repeats (full mutation FM) alleles) and thus 
      developing Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). PM alleles can be somatically unstable. This 
      can lead to individuals being mosaic for multiple size alleles. Here, we describe 
      a detailed evaluation of somatic mosaicism in a large cohort of female PM 
      carriers and show that 94% display some evidence of somatic instability with the 
      presence of a series of expanded alleles that differ from the next allele by a 
      single repeat unit. Using two different metrics for instability that we have 
      developed, we show that, as with intergenerational instability, there is a direct 
      relationship between the extent of somatic expansion and the number of CGG 
      repeats in the originally inherited allele and an inverse relationship with the 
      number of AGG interruptions. Expansions are progressive as evidenced by a 
      positive correlation with age and by examination of blood samples from the same 
      individual taken at different time points. Our data also suggests the existence 
      of other genetic or environmental factors that affect the extent of somatic 
      expansion. Importantly, the analysis of candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs) suggests that two DNA repair factors, FAN1 and MSH3, may be modifiers of 
      somatic expansion risk in the PM population as observed in other repeat expansion 
      disorders.

AB  - FMR1 premutation cytosine-guanine-guanine repeat expansion alleles are relatively 
      common mutations in the general population that are associated with a 
      neurodegenerative disease (fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome), 
      reproductive health problems and potentially a wide range of additional mental 
      and general health conditions that are not yet well-characterised. The 
      International Fragile X Premutation Registry (IFXPR) was developed to facilitate 
      and encourage research to better understand the FMR1 premutation and its impact 
      on human health, to facilitate clinical trial readiness by identifying and 
      characterising diverse cohorts of individuals interested in study participation, 
      and to build community and collaboration among carriers, family members, 
      researchers and clinicians around the world. Here, we describe the development 
      and content of the IFXPR, characterise its first 747 registrants from 32 
      countries and invite investigators to apply for recruitment support for their 
      project(s). With larger numbers, increased diversity and potentially the future 
      clinical characterisation of registrants, the IFXPR will contribute to a more 
      comprehensive and accurate understanding of the fragile X premutation in human 
      health and support treatment studies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The CGG repeats in the 5' untranslated region of the fragile X 
      mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) gene shows increased instability upon maternal 
      transmission. Maternal FMR1 intermediate (45-54 repeats) and premutation (PM: 
      55-<200 repeats) alleles usually expand to full mutation (>200 repeats) alleles 
      in offspring and consequently, cause fragile X syndrome (FXS) in them. METHODS: 
      In a prospective cohort study, Pakistani pregnant women in prenatal care were 
      first screened for FMR1 expanded alleles. In the follow-up, pregnancy outcomes in 
      women carrying FMR1 expanded alleles were recorded and their newborn offspring 
      were also screened for FXS. RESULTS: In a total of 1950 pregnant women, 89 (4.6%) 
      were detected carriers for FMR1 expanded alleles; however, rates of detection of 
      expanded alleles were found significantly high in women with a history of FXS. In 
      addition, miscarriages and birth of affected newborns with FXS were significantly 
      more common in women carrying large size PM alleles and had a history of FXS 
      (P = 0.0494 and P = 0.0494, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The current study 
      provides the first evidence of screening Pakistani pregnant women for FMR1 
      expanded alleles in prenatal care. Moreover, the miscarriage was also detected as 
      a clinical predictor for FXS. IMPACT: Offspring would have a higher risk of 
      developing FXS due to maternal FMR1 alleles expansions during transmission. This 
      is the first prospective cohort study in Pakistan for finding FMR1 allelic status 
      of pregnant women and their newborn offspring in follow-up. The robust offspring 
      risk for FXS estimated in this study may be valuable information for genetic 
      counseling of women carriers for FMR1 expanded alleles. The family history and 
      miscarriage were detected as effective indicators for FXS carrier screening in 
      Pakistani women.

      Genotype Verification.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome and other fragile X-associated disorders are caused by the 
      full-mutation (>200 copies) and premutation (55 to 200 copies) expansion, 
      respectively, of the CGG short tandem repeat in the fragile X messenger 
      ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene. Clinical diagnostic laboratories use Southern 
      blot analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests to detect and/or 
      size the FMR1 CGG repeats. The development of sensitive and high-throughput 
      triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) assays has diminished the need to subject all samples 
      to Southern blot analysis, which is both labor- and time-intensive. In this 
      article, we describe two direct TP-PCR (dTP-PCR) assays for the detection of FMR1 
      CGG repeat expansions. We outline a protocol that is based on melting curve 
      analysis of dTP-PCR amplicons for a rapid and cost-effective first-tier screening 
      and identification of individuals with premutation and full-mutation expansions. 
      We also describe a protocol that employs capillary electrophoresis to resolve the 
      dTP-PCR amplicon fragments and to estimate the repeat sizes of normal (5 to 44 
      copies), intermediate (45 to 54 copies), and premutation alleles, as well as to 
      detect full mutations and determine the structure of the FMR1 alleles. (c) 2022 The

TI  - Whole genome sequencing for the diagnosis of neurological repeat expansion 
      disorders in the UK: a retrospective diagnostic accuracy and prospective clinical 
      validation study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansion disorders affect about 1 in 3000 individuals and are 
      clinically heterogeneous diseases caused by expansions of short tandem DNA 
      repeats. Genetic testing is often locus-specific, resulting in underdiagnosis of 
      people who have atypical clinical presentations, especially in paediatric 
      patients without a previous positive family history. Whole genome sequencing is 
      increasingly used as a first-line test for other rare genetic disorders, and we 
      aimed to assess its performance in the diagnosis of patients with neurological 
      repeat expansion disorders. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic 
      accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect the most common repeat expansion 
      loci associated with neurological outcomes (AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, 
      C9orf72, CACNA1A, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, and TBP) using samples obtained within 
      the National Health Service in England from patients who were suspected of having 
      neurological disorders; previous PCR test results were used as the reference 
      standard. The clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat 
      expansions was prospectively examined in previously genetically tested and 
      undiagnosed patients recruited in 2013-17 to the 100 000 Genomes Project in the 
      UK, who were suspected of having a genetic neurological disorder (familial or 
      early-onset forms of ataxia, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, dementia, motor 
      neuron disease, parkinsonian movement disorders, intellectual disability, or 
      neuromuscular disorders). If a repeat expansion call was made using whole genome 
      sequencing, PCR was used to confirm the result. FINDINGS: The diagnostic accuracy 
      of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat expansions was evaluated against 793 
      PCR tests previously performed within the NHS from 404 patients. Whole genome 
      sequencing correctly classified 215 of 221 expanded alleles and 1316 of 1321 
      non-expanded alleles, showing 97.3% sensitivity (95% CI 94.2-99.0) and 99.6% 
      specificity (99.1-99.9) across the 13 disease-associated loci when compared with 
      PCR test results. In samples from 11 631 patients in the 100 000 Genomes Project, 
      whole genome sequencing identified 81 repeat expansions, which were also tested 
      by PCR: 68 were confirmed as repeat expansions in the full pathogenic range, 11 
      were non-pathogenic intermediate expansions or premutations, and two were 
      non-expanded repeats (16% false discovery rate). INTERPRETATION: In our study, 
      whole genome sequencing for the detection of repeat expansions showed high 
      sensitivity and specificity, and it led to identification of neurological repeat 
      expansion disorders in previously undiagnosed patients. These findings support 
      implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical laboratories for diagnosis 
      of patients who have a neurological presentation consistent with a repeat 
      expansion disorder. FUNDING: Medical Research Council, Department of Health and

TI  - GIPC1 CGG Repeat Expansion Is Associated with Movement Disorders.
PG  - 704-715

AB  - OBJECTIVE: CGG/GGC repeat expansion in FMR1 and NOTCH2NLC is reportedly 
      associated with movement disorders; therefore, we hypothesized that the CGG 
      repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1, which was previously identified 
      in myopathy, might also be associated with movement-disorder phenotypes. Here, we 
      investigated whether CGG repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1 
      presents in a cohort of patients with movement disorders. METHODS: We screened 
      for the CGG repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1 in 1,346 
      movement-disorder patients and 1,451 matched healthy controls. RESULTS: No 
      patients or controls harbored expanded CGG repeats in LRP12 or NUTM2B-AS1, 
      whereas 16 patients harbored >40 CGG repeats in GIPC1, with 11 of these patients 
      harboring >60 CGG repeats. One control individual harbored an expanded GIPC1 
      allele (83 CGG units), suggesting that approximately 1% of patients affected by 
      movement disorders in our population might harbor GIPC1 CGG repeat expansion, 
      with this likely extremely rare in healthy controls (<0.001). The clinical 
      phenotypes of the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive patients strongly resembled those in 
      patients displaying NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat-positive movement disorders. 
      Additionally, the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive patients presented white-matter 
      hyperintensities but without typical NOTCH2NLC-related high-intensity signals in 
      the corticomedullary junction. Furthermore, 44% of the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive 
      patients showed a cognitive deficit, and skin biopsies in 2 patients revealed 
      deposition of intranuclear inclusions. INTERPRETATION: The CGG repeat expansion 
      in GIPC1 might be associated with movement-disorder phenotypes and lead to 
      diseases related to intranuclear inclusions. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:704-715.

AB  - Female FMR1 premutation (FMR1 PM) carriers for fragile X syndrome (FXS) are at 
      risk to have a child with FXS based on their CGG repeat size and AGG interruption 
      number. Studies examining this risk in unselected populations of female PM 
      carriers are lacking. This retrospective cohort study analyzed carrier status, 
      CGG repeat length, AGG interruption result, and reproductive risk refinement in a 
      population of female patients who underwent routine carrier screening for FXS. A 
      total of 1536 PM carriers (0.43%) were identified, 95% of whom had between 55 and 
      90 CGG repeats. A number of 1334 carriers underwent AGG interruption testing. The 
      majority had at least one AGG interruption and received a lower reproductive risk 
      for FXS following AGG interruption testing (89% and 85%, respectively) as 
      compared to their risk calculated based on CGG repeat size alone. The average 
      change in risk across the population following AGG interruption testing was 
      -3.4%, with a range from -50.8% to 48.9%. This article describes the range of CGG 
      repeats and AGG interruptions in an unselected population of female PM carriers 
      and suggests that most carriers would benefit from AGG interruption testing to 
      refine their reproductive risk of having a child with FXS.

AB  - Substantial evidence now suggests an association between the FMR1 genotype and 
      female fertility. The aim of this study was to determine whether a high normal 
      FMR1 allele (35-54 repeats) affects in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes in 
      Chinese women. A total of 120 women with 210 IVF cycles were retrospectively 
      recruited in this study. The patients were divided into two groups based on the 
      FMR1 repeat lengths at allele 2 (normal repeat group: <35 repeats; high repeat 
      group: 35-54 repeats). The observed primary outcomes were the clinical pregnancy 
      rate and live birth rate. No associations were observed between the high normal 
      FMR1 allele and lower clinical pregnancy rate or live birth rate after adjusting 
      for maternal age, education, work status, duration of infertility and number of 
      embryos transferred (aOR 0.633, 95% CI 0.249-1.601, p = 0.337; aOR 0.325, 95% CI 
      0.094-1.118, p = 0.075; respectively). However, after additionally adjusting for 
      anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level, there was a weak but significant association 
      between high normal sized CGG repeats and a lower live birth rate (aOR 0.218, 95% 
      CI 0.057-0.836, p = 0.026). The rate of available embryos showed a decreasing 
      trend in patients with a high normal FMR1 allele, although the difference was not 
      statistically significant after adjusting for maternal age, education, work 
      status, duration of infertility and AMH level (aOR 0.905, 95% CI 0.810-1.011, 
      p = 0.078). Furthermore, the number of CGG repeats in either allele was not 
      associated with the live birth rate after adjusting for all confounding factors 
      (aOR 0.832, 95% CI 0.677-1.023, p = 0.081; aOR 0.865, 95% CI 0.651-1.148, 
      p = 0.315; respectively). In addition, no significant differences were found in 
      the rates of good-quality embryos (p = 0.263), miscarriage (p = 0.861) or cycle 
      cancellation (p = 0.295) between the groups. Taken together, in the Chinese 
      population, individuals with high normal sized CGG repeats on the FMR1 gene have 
      a higher risk of reduced live birth rates in childbearing age. Therefore, we 
      recommend enhanced screening for fragile X syndrome in women of childbearing age 
      in China. This study also suggests that the association between the FMR1 genotype 
      and fertility in Chinese women merits further research.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess relationship between CGG repeat 
      lengths and ovarian reserve and response to controlled ovarian stimulation (COH). 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study was carried out on patients 
      (n = 49) who were admitted to the in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinic of the 
      Zeynep Kamil Women's and Children's Diseases Training and Research Hospital, 
      University of Health Sciences. Women under 40 years of age with premature ovarian 
      insufficiency underwent genetic analysis to determine CGG repeat lengths. Ovarian 
      reserve was assessed for each participant and participants underwent ovarian 
      hyperstimulation and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycle. Relationships 
      between ovarian reserve, cycle outcome and CGG repeat lengths were assessed. 
      Variables including fertility assessment including ovarian reserve tests 
      (Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), Luteinizing hormone (LH), Estradiol (E2), 
      Prolactin (PRL), Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), Antimullerian hormone (AMH), 
      antral follicle count (AFC) tests) and some IVF cycle characteristics were 
      assessed in relation to number of CGG repeat numbers. RESULTS: None of the 
      ovarian reserve tests and cycle characteristics was found to be correlated with 
      CGG repeat lengths. Comparison of ovarian reserve tests and cycle characteristics 
      revealed no difference between groups of women with CGG repeat length > 55 and 
      CGG repeat length </= 55. Antimullerian hormone (AMH) was a significant predictor 
      for cycle cancellation (AUC = 0.779, P = 0.008). AMH level > 0.035 was found to 
      be the optimal cut off value to predict cycles reaching to embryo transfer with 
      71% sensitivity and 85% specificity. The rate of cycle cancellation was 71% in 
      cases with AMH </= 0.035 whereas it was 20% in cases with AMH > 0.035 (p = 0.001). 
      No difference was determined between groups with and without cycle cancellation 
      in terms of CGG repeat lengths (55.3 vs. 53.9, p = 0.769). Among cycles reaching 
      to embryo transfer stage, 3 (13.6%) pregnancies were achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      data showed no relationship between CGG repeat lengths and ovarian reserve and 
      response to controlled ovarian stimulation. This data also showed that no 
      clinical difference between FMR gene mutation related POI and other etiologies.

AB  - Methylated FMR1 full-mutation expansions cause fragile X syndrome. FMR1 
      premutation carriers are susceptible to other late-onset conditions, and women 
      with premutation are at risk of transmitting a fully expanded FMR1 allele to 
      offspring. Identification of individuals with actionable FMR1 genotypes 
      (full-mutation males and females, and premutation females at risk for primary 
      ovarian insufficiency and/or having fragile X-affected offspring) can enable 
      timely access to intervention services and genetic counseling. This study 
      presents a rapid, first-tier test based on melting curve analysis of 
      methylation-specific triplet-primed PCR amplicons (msTP-PCR MCA) for concurrent 
      detection of FMR1 CGG-repeat expansions and their methylation status. The 
      msTP-PCR MCA assay was optimized on 20 fragile X reference samples, and its 
      performance was evaluated on 111 peripheral blood-derived DNA samples from 
      patients who have undergone prior molecular testing with PCR and/or Southern blot 
      analysis. The msTP-PCR MCA assay detected all samples with a methylated FMR1 
      CGG-repeat expansion, and had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive 
      value, and negative predictive values of 100%, 92.06%, 91.1%, and 100%, 
      respectively. The msTP-PCR MCA assay identified premutation/full-mutation 
      mosaicism down to 1%, detected skewed inactivation in females with FMR1 
      expansions, and enabled selective identification of all individuals with an 
      actionable FMR1 genotype. The msTP-PCR MCA assay may aid in fragile X screening 
      of at-risk populations and newborns and voluntary carrier screening of women of 
      reproductive age.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Women who carry a premutation allele of the FMR1 gene are at 
      increased vulnerability to an array of age-related symptoms and disorders, 
      including age-related decline in select cognitive skills. However, the risk 
      factors for age-related decline are poorly understood, including the potential 
      role of family history and genetic factors. In other forms of pathological aging, 
      early decline in syntactic complexity is observed and predicts the later onset of 
      neurodegenerative disease. To shed light on the earliest signs of degeneration, 
      the present study characterized longitudinal changes in the syntactic complexity 
      of women with the FMR1 premutation across midlife, and associations with family 
      history of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and CGG repeat 
      length. METHODS: Forty-five women with the FMR1 premutation aged 35-64 years at 
      study entry participated in 1-5 longitudinal assessments spaced approximately a 
      year apart (130 observations total). All participants were mothers of children 
      with confirmed fragile X syndrome. Language samples were analyzed for syntactic 
      complexity and participants provided information on family history of FXTAS. CGG 
      repeat length was determined via molecular genetic testing. RESULTS: Hierarchical 
      linear models indicated that women who reported a family history of FXTAS 
      exhibited faster age-related decline in syntactic complexity than those without a 
      family history, with that difference emerging as the women reached their 
      mid-50 s. CGG repeat length was not a significant predictor of age-related 
      change. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that women with the FMR1 premutation who 
      have a family history of FXTAS may be at increased risk for neurodegenerative 
      disease, as indicated by age-related loss of syntactic complexity. Thus, family 
      history of FXTAS may represent a personalized risk factor for age-related 
      disease. Follow-up study is needed to determine whether syntactic decline is an 
      early indicator of FXTAS specifically, as opposed to being a more general 
      age-related cognitive decline associated with the FMR1 premutation.

      Causes Behavioral Phenotypes That Vary by Sex and Genotype in Juvenile Mice 
      Expressing Human Mutations That Modulate Neuronal Calcium.

AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are putative environmental risks for 
      neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we tested two hypotheses: (1) developmental 
      exposure to a human-relevant PCB mixture causes behavioral phenotypes relevant to 
      neurodevelopmental disorders; and (2) expression of human mutations that 
      dysregulate neuronal Ca(2+) homeostasis influence sensitivity to behavioral 
      effects of developmental PCB exposures. To test these hypotheses, we used mice 
      that expressed a gain-of-function mutation (T4826I) in ryanodine receptor 1 
      (RYR1), the X-linked fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) CGG repeat expansion 
      or both mutations (double mutant; DM). Transgenic mice and wildtype (WT) mice 
      were exposed to the MARBLES PCB mix at 0, 0.1, 1, and 6 mg/kg/day in the maternal 
      diet throughout gestation and lactation. The MARBLES PCB mix simulates the 
      relative proportions of the 12 most abundant PCB congeners found in the serum of 
      pregnant women at increased risk for having a child with a neurodevelopmental 
      disorder. We assessed ultrasonic vocalizations at postnatal day 7 (P7), 
      spontaneous repetitive behaviors at P25-P30, and sociability at P27-P32. 
      Developmental PCB exposure reduced ultrasonic vocalizations in WT litters in all 
      dose groups, but had no effect on ultrasonic vocalizations in transgenic litters. 
      Developmental PCB exposure significantly increased self-grooming and decreased 
      sociability in WT males in the 0.1 mg/kg dose group, but had no effect on WT 
      females in any dose group. Genotype alone influenced ultrasonic vocalizations, 
      self-grooming and to a lesser extent sociability. Genotype alone also influenced 
      effects of PCBs on sociability. PCB levels in the brain tissue of pups increased 
      in a dose-dependent manner, but within any dose group did not differ between 
      genotypes. In summary, developmental PCB exposure phenocopied social behavior 
      phenotypes observed in mice expressing human mutations that modify intracellular 
      Ca(2+) dynamics, and expression of these mutations alleviated PCB effects on 
      ultrasonic vocalizations and repetitive behavior, and modified the dose-response 
      relationships and sex-dependent effects of PCB effects on social behavior. These 
      findings suggest that: (1) developmental PCB exposure causes behavioral 
      phenotypes that vary by sex and genotype; and (2) sex-specific responses to 
      environmental factors may contribute to sex biases in the prevalence and/or 
      severity of neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex disorder with a heterogeneous 
      etiology. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is recognized as the most common single gene 
      mutation associated with ASD. FXS patients show some autistic behaviors and may 
      be difficult to distinguish at a young age from autistic children. However, there 
      have been no published reports on the prevalence of FXS in ASD patients in 
      Thailand. In this study, we present a pilot study to analyze the CGG repeat sizes 
      of the FMR1 gene in Thai autistic patients. We screened 202 unrelated Thai 
      patients (168 males and 34 females) with nonsyndromic ASD and 212 normal controls 
      using standard FXS molecular diagnosis techniques. The distributions of FMR1 CGG 
      repeat sizes in the ASD and normal control groups were similar, with the two most 
      common alleles having 29 and 30 CGG repeats, followed by an allele with 36 CGG 
      repeats. No FMR1 full mutations or premutations were found in either ASD 
      individuals or the normal controls. Interestingly, three ASD male patients with 
      high normal CGG and intermediate CGG repeats (44, 46, and 53 CGG repeats) were 
      identified, indicating that the prevalence of FMR1 intermediate alleles in Thai 
      ASD patients was approximately 1% while these alleles were absent in the normal 
      male controls. Our study indicates that CGG repeat expansions of the FMR1 gene 
      may not be a common genetic cause of nonsyndromic ASD in Thai patients. However, 
      further studies for mutations other than the CGG expansion in the FMR1 gene are 
      required to get a better information on FXS prevalence in Thai ASD patients.

AB  - While many neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are thought to result from 
      interactions between environmental and genetic risk factors, the identification 
      of specific gene-environment interactions that influence NDD risk remains a 
      critical data gap. We tested the hypothesis that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 
      interact with human mutations that alter the fidelity of neuronal Ca(2+) 
      signaling to confer NDD risk. To test this, we used three transgenic mouse lines 
      that expressed human mutations known to alter Ca(2+) signals in neurons: (1) 
      gain-of-function mutation in ryanodine receptor-1 (T4826I-RYR1); (2) CGG-repeat 
      expansion in the 5' non-coding portion of the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 
      (FMR1); and (3) a double mutant (DM) that expressed both mutations. Transgenic 
      and wildtype (WT) mice were exposed throughout gestation and lactation to the 
      MARBLES PCB mix at 0.1, 1, or 6 mg/kg in the maternal diet. The MARBLES mix 
      simulates the relative proportions of the twelve most abundant PCB congeners 
      found in serum from pregnant women at increased risk for having a child with an 
      NDD. Using Golgi staining, the effect of developmental PCB exposure on dendritic 
      arborization of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 hippocampus and somatosensory cortex 
      of male and female WT mice was compared to pyramidal neurons from transgenic 
      mice. A multilevel linear mixed-effects model identified a main effect of dose 
      driven by increased dendritic arborization of cortical neurons in the 1 mg/kg PCB 
      dose group. Subsequent analyses with genotypes indicated that the MARBLES PCB 
      mixture had no effect on the dendritic arborization of hippocampal neurons in WT 
      mice of either sex, but significantly increased dendritic arborization of 
      cortical neurons of WT males in the 6 mg/kg PCB dose group. Transgene expression 
      increased sensitivity to the impact of developmental PCB exposure on dendritic 
      arborization in a sex-, and brain region-dependent manner. In conclusion, 
      developmental exposure to PCBs present in the gestational environment of at-risk 
      humans interfered with normal dendritic morphogenesis in the developing mouse 
      brain in a sex-, genotype- and brain region-dependent manner. Overall, these 
      observations provide proof-of-principle evidence that PCBs interact with 
      heritable mutations to modulate a neurodevelopmental outcome of relevance to 
      NDDs.

AB  - Fragile X Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative 
      disorder affecting carriers of premutation alleles (PM) of the X-linked FMR1 
      gene, which contain CGG repeat expansions of 55-200 range in a non-coding region. 
      This late-onset disorder is characterised by the presence of tremor/ataxia and 
      cognitive decline, associated with the white matter lesions throughout the brain, 
      especially involving the middle cerebellar peduncles. Nearly half of older male 
      and ~ 20% of female PM carriers develop FXTAS. While there is evidence for 
      mitochondrial dysfunction in neural and some peripheral tissues from FXTAS 
      patients (though less obvious in the non-FXTAS PM carriers), the results from 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are still controversial. Motor, 
      cognitive, and neuropsychiatric impairments were correlated with measures of 
      mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial respiratory activity, AMPK, and TORC1 
      cellular stress-sensing protein kinases, and CGG repeat size, in a sample of 
      adult FXTAS male and female carriers. Moreover, the levels of these cellular 
      measures, all derived from Epstein- Barr virus (EBV)- transformed and easily 
      accessible blood lymphoblasts, were compared between the FXTAS (N = 23) and 
      non-FXTAS (n = 30) subgroups, and with baseline data from 33 healthy 
      non-carriers. A significant hyperactivity of cellular bioenergetics components as 
      compared with the baseline data, more marked in the non-FXTAS PMs, was negatively 
      correlated with repeat numbers at the lower end of the CGG-PM distribution. 
      Significant associations of these components with motor impairment measures, 
      including tremor-ataxia and parkinsonism, and neuropsychiatric changes, were 
      prevalent in the FXTAS subgroup. Moreover, a striking elevation of AMPK activity, 
      and a decrease in TORC1 levels, especially in the non-FXTAS carriers, were 
      related to the size of CGG expansion. The bioenergetics changes in blood 
      lymphoblasts are biomarkers of the clinical status of FMR1 carriers. The 
      relationship between these changes and neurological involvement in the affected 
      carriers suggests that brain bioenergetic alterations are reflected in this 
      peripheral tissue. A possible neuroprotective role of stress sensing kinase, 
      AMPK, in PM carriers, should be addressed in future longitudinal studies. A 
      decreased level of TORC1-the mechanistic target of the rapamycin complex, 
      suggests a possible future approach to therapy in FXTAS.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is an adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by FMR1 premutation expansion of CGG repeats. 
      FXTAS can be misdiagnosed with many neurodegenerative disorders manifesting with 
      cerebellar ataxias owing to their overlapping clinical and radiological features. 
      The frequency of the FMR1 premutation allele in Japan has not been fully 
      determined. Herein, we aimed to determine the frequency of FMR1 premutation 
      alleles in Japanese patients with undiagnosed cerebellar ataxia and multiple 
      system atrophy, using repeat-primed PCR in 186 patients with adult onset of 
      undiagnosed cerebellar ataxia and 668 patients with multiple system atrophy, to 
      identify expanded CGG repeats as well as to detect AGG interruptions within the 
      expanded alleles. The size of expansions was estimated using fragment length 
      analysis of PCR products obtained by conventional PCR employing a pair of unique 
      primers flanking the repeat sequence. We identified FMR1 premutation alleles in 
      three male patients. One patient revealed 84 repeat units with one AGG 
      interruption and another patient showed 103 repeat units. Both had presented with 
      sporadic cerebellar ataxia, giving an estimated frequency of 3.7% among Japanese 
      male patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia with age at onset above 50 years. 
      One patient with the clinical diagnosis of multiple system atrophy harbored 60 
      repeat units with four AGG interruptions. FMR1 intermediate alleles were observed 
      in two males and one female among the multiple system atrophy patients. We found 
      that genetic tests for FMR1 premutation should be considered in Japanese male 
      patients with cerebellar ataxia with the age at onset above 50 years.

LID - 10.3390/genes12111669 [doi]
LID - 1669
AB  - FMR1 (FMRP translational regulator 1) variants other than repeat expansion are 
      known to cause disease phenotypes but can be overlooked if they are not accounted 
      for in genetic testing strategies. We collected and reanalyzed the evidence for 
      pathogenicity of FMR1 coding, noncoding, and copy number variants published to 
      date. There is a spectrum of disease-causing FMR1 variation, with clinical and 
      functional evidence supporting pathogenicity of five splicing, five missense, one 
      in-frame deletion, one nonsense, and four frameshift variants. In addition, FMR1 
      deletions occur in both mosaic full mutation patients and as constitutional 
      pathogenic alleles. De novo deletions arise not only from full mutation alleles 
      but also alleles with normal-sized CGG repeats in several patients, suggesting 
      that the CGG repeat region may be prone to genomic instability even in the 
      absence of repeat expansion. We conclude that clinical tests for potentially 
      FMR1-related indications such as intellectual disability should include methods 
      capable of detecting small coding, noncoding, and copy number variants.

TI  - FMR1 allele frequencies in 51,000 newborns: a large-scale population study in 
      China.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by CGG-repeat expansion in FMR1 
      promoter, is one of the most common causes of mental retardation. Individuals 
      with full mutation and premutation alleles have a high risk of 
      psychophysiological disorder and of having affected offspring. Frequencies of 
      FMR1 alleles in general newborns have been reported in Caucasians but have not 
      been investigated in the large-scale population in  the mainland of China. 
      METHODS: The sizes of FMR1 CGG-repeats were analyzed in 51,661 newborns (28,114 
      males and 23,547 females) and also in a cohort of 33 children diagnosed with 
      developmental delay using GC-rich polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and triple 
      repeat primed PCR. RESULTS: The frequency of CGG repeats > 100 was 1/9371 in 
      males and 1/5887 in females, and the frequency of CGG repeats > 54 was 1/1561 in 
      males and 1/1624 in females. FMR1 full mutation and premutation were identified 
      in 27.27% of children who had Ages and Stages Questionnaire scores less than two 
      standard deviations from the cutoff value. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed the 
      prevalence of FXS in China and improved the sample databases of FXS, suggesting 
      that the prevalence of FXS in Chinese is higher than estimated previously and 
      that FXS screening can be advised to high-risk families.

PG  - 757825

AB  - Background: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common single-gene cause of 
      intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is caused by a 
      >200-trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region of the fragile 
      X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Individuals with FXS can present with a range 
      of neurobehavioral impairments including, but not limited to: cognitive, 
      language, and adaptive deficits; ASD; anxiety; social withdrawal and avoidance; 
      and aggression. Decreased expression of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) 
      receptor delta subunit and deficient GABAergic tonic inhibition could be associated 
      with symptoms of FXS. Gaboxadol (OV101) is a delta-subunit-selective, extrasynaptic 
      GABA(A) receptor agonist that enhances GABAergic tonic inhibition, providing the 
      rationale for assessment of OV101 as a potential targeted treatment of FXS. No 
      drug is approved in the United States for the treatment of FXS. Methods: This 
      12-weeks, randomized (1:1:1), double-blind, parallel-group, phase 2a study was 
      designed to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and optimal daily dose of 
      OV101 5 mg [once (QD), twice (BID), or three-times daily (TID)] when administered 
      for 12 weeks to adolescent and adult men with FXS. Safety was the primary study 
      objective, with key assessments including treatment-emergent adverse events 
      (TEAEs), treatment-related adverse events leading to study discontinuation, and 
      serious adverse events (SAEs). The secondary study objective was to evaluate the 
      effect of OV101 on a variety of problem behaviors. Results: A total of 23 
      participants with FXS (13 adolescents, 10 adults) with moderate-to-severe 
      neurobehavioral phenotypes (Full Scale Intelligence Quotient, 41.5 +/- 3.29; ASD, 
      82.6%) were randomized to OV101 5 mg QD (n = 8), 5 mg BID (n = 8), or 5 mg TID (n 
      = 7) for 12 weeks. OV101 was well tolerated across all 3 treatment regimens. The 
      most common TEAEs were upper respiratory tract infection (n = 4), headache (n = 
      3), diarrhea (n = 2), and irritability (n = 2). No SAEs were reported. 
      Improvements from baseline to end-of-treatment were observed on several efficacy 
      endpoints, and 60% of participants were identified as treatment responders based 
      on Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement. Conclusions: Overall, OV101 was safe 
      and well tolerated. Efficacy results demonstrate an initial signal for OV101 in 
      individuals with FXS. These results need to be confirmed in a larger, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled study with optimal outcomes and in the most appropriate age 
      group. Clinical Trial Registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier:

TI  - FMRP Levels in Human Peripheral Blood Leukocytes Correlates with Intellectual 
      Disability.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics11101780 [doi]
LID - 1780
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual 
      disability. FXS is an X-linked, neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a CGG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the Fragile 
      X Mental Retardation gene, FMR1. Greater than 200 CGG repeats results in 
      epigenetic silencing of the gene leading to the deficiency or absence of Fragile 
      X mental retardation protein (FMRP). The loss of FMRP is considered the root 
      cause of FXS. The relationship between neurological function and FMRP expression 
      in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has not been well established. 
      Assays to detect and measure FMR1 and FMRP have been described; however, none are 
      sufficiently sensitive, precise, or quantitative to properly characterize the 
      relationships between cognitive ability and CGG repeat number, FMR1 mRNA 
      expression, or FMRP expression measured in PBMCs. To address these limitations, 
      two novel immunoassays were developed and optimized, an electro-chemiluminescence 
      immunoassay and a multiparameter flow cytometry assay. Both assays were performed 
      on PMBCs isolated from 27 study participants with FMR1 CGG repeats ranging from 
      normal to full mutation. After correcting for methylation, a significant positive 
      correlation between CGG repeat number and FMR1 mRNA expression levels and a 
      significant negative correlation between FMRP levels and CGG repeat expansion was 
      observed. Importantly, a high positive correlation was observed between 
      intellectual quotient (IQ) and FMRP expression measured in PBMCs.

AB  - Traditional methods for the analysis of repeat expansions, which underlie genetic 
      disorders, such as fragile X syndrome (FXS), lack single-nucleotide resolution in 
      repeat analysis and the ability to characterize causative variants outside the 
      repeat array. These drawbacks can be overcome by long-read and short-read 
      sequencing, respectively. However, the routine application of next-generation 
      sequencing in the clinic requires target enrichment, and none of the available 
      methods allows parallel analysis of long-DNA fragments using both sequencing 
      technologies. In this study, we investigated the use of indirect sequence capture 
      (Xdrop technology) coupled to Nanopore and Illumina sequencing to characterize 
      FMR1, the gene responsible of FXS. We achieved the efficient enrichment (> 200x) 
      of large target DNA fragments (~60-80 kbp) encompassing the entire FMR1 gene. The 
      analysis of Xdrop-enriched samples by Nanopore long-read sequencing allowed the 
      complete characterization of repeat lengths in samples with normal, pre-mutation, 
      and full mutation status (> 1 kbp), and correctly identified repeat interruptions 
      relevant for disease prognosis and transmission. Single-nucleotide variants 
      (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (indels) could be detected in the same 
      samples by Illumina short-read sequencing, completing the mutational testing 
      through the identification of pathogenic variants within the FMR1 gene, when no 
      typical CGG repeat expansion is detected. The study successfully demonstrated the 
      parallel analysis of repeat expansions and SNVs/indels in the FMR1 gene at 
      single-nucleotide resolution by combining Xdrop enrichment with two 
      next-generation sequencing approaches. With the appropriate optimization 
      necessary for the clinical settings, the system could facilitate both the study 
      of genotype-phenotype correlation in FXS and enable a more efficient diagnosis 
      and genetic counseling for patients and their relatives.

TI  - FXTAS is difficult to differentiate from neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease 
      through skin biopsy: a case report.
PG  - 396
LID - 10.1186/s12883-021-02425-z [doi]
LID - 396
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and 
      late-onset neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) show CGG/GGC 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions. Differentiating these diseases are difficult 
      because of the similarity in their clinical and radiological features. It is 
      unclear that skin biopsy can distinguish NIID from FXTAS. We performed a skin 
      biopsy in an FXTAS case with cognitive dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy 
      without tremor, which was initially suspected to be NIID. CASE PRESENTATION: The 
      patient underwent neurological assessment and examinations, including laboratory 
      tests, electrophysiologic test, imaging, skin biopsy, and genetic test. A brain 
      MRI showed hyperintensity lesions along the corticomedullary junction on 
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in addition to middle cerebellar peduncle sign 
      (MCP sign). We suspected NIID from the clinical picture and the radiological 
      findings, and performed a skin biopsy. The skin biopsy specimen showed ubiquitin- 
      and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions, suggesting NIID. However, a genetic 
      analysis for NIID using repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR) revealed 
      no expansion detected in the Notch 2 N-terminal like C (NOTCH2NLC) gene. We then 
      performed genetic analysis for FXTAS using RP-PCR, which revealed a repeat 
      CGG/GGC expansion in the FMRP translational regulator 1 (FMR1) gene. The number 
      of repeats was 83. We finally diagnosed the patient with FXTAS rather than NIID. 
      CONCLUSIONS: For the differential diagnosis of FXTAS and NIID, a skin biopsy 
      alone is insufficient; instead, genetic analysis, is essential. Further 
      investigations in additional cases based on genetic analysis are needed to 
      elucidate the clinical and pathological differences between FXTAS and NIID.

TI  - Utilization of Whole Exome Sequencing in Non-Syndromic Premature Ovarian Failure: 
      Ficolin-3 Gene Mutation in an Iranian Family.
PG  - 441-6
LID - 10.52547/ibj.25.6.441 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Premature ovarian failure is a heterogeneous disorder, leading to 
      early menopause. Several genes have been identified as the cause of non-syndromic 
      premature ovarian failure (POF). Our aim was to explore the genetic defects in 
      Iranian patients with POF. METHODS: We studied a family with three females 
      exhibiting non-syndromic POF. WES was performed for one of the affected 
      individuals after ruling out the presence of CGG repeat expansion at fragile X 
      mental retardation 1 gene in the family. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm 
      the candidate sequence variants in the proband, and screening of the detected 
      mutation was performed for the other affected and unaffected members of the 
      family. RESULTS: A homozygous frameshift mutation, c.349delC, was identified in 
      ficolin-3 (FCN3) gene in the proband and two other patients. The parents and two 
      healthy brothers were heterozygous for the mutation, and an unaffected sister was 
      homozygous for wild type. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of a mutation in 
      FCN3 gene in a family with POF. Our findings can lead to the enhancement of 
      genetic databases of patients with POF, specifically for families with high-risk 
      background.

      Brazilian patients.
PG  - 237-240
LID - 10.5935/1518-0557.20210063 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to identify mutations in the FMR1 gene in a group of 
      Brazilian women diagnosed with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). METHODS: This 
      cross-sectional study included patients aged under 40 years with confirmed POI 
      from a convenience sample of patients seen from June 2017 to December 2018 at a 
      University Hospital in Curitiba, Brazil. Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed 
      using FragilEase(tm) PCR kits (PerkinElmer), a commercially available test that 
      enables the quantification of CGG trinucleotide repeat expansions in the FMR1 
      gene. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients with an average age of 35.8+/-3.97 years were 
      included. Fifty (96.1%) had normal alleles with 18 to 43 CGG repeats. The most 
      frequent CGG-repeat sizes were 28 and 30. Two patients (3.8%) presented mutations 
      in the FMR1 gene. The first had alleles with 19/97 CGG repeats, was categorized 
      as a premutation carrier for FXS, and had a son with cognitive impairment. The 
      second had alleles with 21/45 CGG repeats and was described as belonging to the 
      gray zone. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, 3.8% of the females with POI had mutations 
      in the FMR1 gene. The most frequent allele sizes were 28 and 30 CGG repeats.

TI  - Is FMR1 CGG Repeat Number Polymorphism Associated With Phenotypic Variation in 
      the General Population? Report From a Cohort of 5,499 Adults.

AB  - FMR1 CGG repeat length was assayed in 5499 research participants (2637 men and 
      2862 women) in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS), a population-based cohort. 
      Most past research has focused on clinically-ascertained individuals with 
      expansions in CGG repeats, either those with fragile X syndrome (> 200 CGG 
      repeats), the FMR1 premutation (55-200 repeats), or in the gray zone (variously 
      defined as 45-54 or 41-54 repeats). In contrast, the WLS is a unique source of 
      data that was obtained from an unselected cohort of individuals from the general 
      population for whom FMR1 CGG repeat length was assayed. The WLS is a random 
      sample of one-third of all high school seniors in the state of Wisconsin in 1957. 
      The most recent round of data collection was in 2011; thus, the study spanned 
      over 50 years. Saliva samples were obtained from 69% of surviving members of the 
      cohort in 2008 and 2011, from which CGG repeats were assayed. With one exception, 
      the CGG repeat length of all members of this cohort was below 100 (ranging from 7 
      to 84). The present study evaluated the genotype-phenotype associations of CGG 
      repeat number and IQ, college graduation, age at menopause, number of biological 
      children, having a child with intellectual or developmental disabilities, and the 
      likelihood of experiencing an episode of depression during adulthood. Linear and 
      curvilinear effects were probed. Although effect sizes were small, significant 
      associations were found between CGG repeat length and high school IQ score, 
      college graduation, number of biological children, age at menopause, and the 
      likelihood of having an episode of depression. However, there was no significant 
      association between repeat length and having a child diagnosed with an IDD 
      condition. This study demonstrates a continuum of phenotype effects with FMR1 
      repeat lengths and illustrates how research inspired by a rare genetic condition 
      (such as fragile X syndrome) can be used to probe genotype-phenotype associations 
      in the general population.

AB  - The FMR1 gene in its premutation (PM) state has been linked to a range of 
      clinical and subclinical phenotypes among FMR1 PM carriers, including some 
      subclinical traits associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study 
      attempted to further characterize the phenotypic profile associated with the FMR1 
      PM by studying a battery of assessments examining clinical-behavioral traits, 
      social-cognitive, and executive abilities in women carrying the FMR1 PM, and 
      associations with FMR1-related variability. Participants included 152 female FMR1 
      PM carriers and 75 female controls who were similar in age and IQ, and screened 
      for neuromotor impairments or signs of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome. The phenotypic battery included assessments of ASD-related personality 
      and language (i.e., pragmatic) traits, symptoms of anxiety and depression, four 
      different social-cognitive tasks that tapped the ability to read internal states 
      and emotions based on different cues (e.g., facial expressions, biological 
      motion, and complex social scenes), and a measure of executive function. Results 
      revealed a complex phenotypic profile among the PM carrier group, where subtle 
      differences were observed in pragmatic language, executive function, and 
      social-cognitive tasks that involved evaluating basic emotions and 
      trustworthiness. The PM carrier group also showed elevated rates of ASD-related 
      personality traits. In contrast, PM carriers performed similarly to controls on 
      social-cognitive tasks that involved reliance on faces and biological motion. The 
      PM group did not differ from controls on self-reported depression or anxiety 
      symptoms. Using latent profile analysis, we observed three distinct subgroups of 
      PM carriers who varied considerably in their performance across tasks. Among PM 
      carriers, CGG repeat length was a significant predictor of pragmatic language 
      violations. Results suggest a nuanced phenotypic profile characterized by subtle 
      differences in select clinical-behavioral, social-cognitive, and executive 
      abilities associated with the FMR1 PM in women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening for short tandem repeat (STR) expansions in next-generation 
      sequencing data can enable diagnosis, optimal clinical management/treatment, and 
      accurate genetic counseling of patients with repeat expansion disorders. We aimed 
      to develop an efficient computational workflow for reliable detection of STR 
      expansions in next-generation sequencing data and demonstrate its clinical 
      utility. METHODS: We characterized the performance of eight STR analysis methods 
      (lobSTR, HipSTR, RepeatSeq, ExpansionHunter, TREDPARSE, GangSTR, STRetch, and 
      exSTRa) on next-generation sequencing datasets of samples with known 
      disease-causing full-mutation STR expansions and genomes simulated to harbor 
      repeat expansions at selected loci and optimized their sensitivity. We then used 
      a machine learning decision tree classifier to identify an optimal combination of 
      methods for full-mutation detection. In Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)-aligned 
      genomes, the ensemble approach of using ExpansionHunter, STRetch, and exSTRa 
      performed the best (precision = 82%, recall = 100%, F1-score = 90%). We applied 
      this pipeline to screen 301 families of children with suspected genetic 
      disorders. RESULTS: We identified 10 individuals with full-mutations in the AR, 
      ATXN1, ATXN8, DMPK, FXN, or HTT disease STR locus in the analyzed families. 
      Additional candidates identified in our analysis include two probands with 
      borderline ATXN2 expansions between the established repeat size range for 
      reduced-penetrance and full-penetrance full-mutation and seven individuals with 
      FMR1 CGG repeats in the intermediate/premutation repeat size range. In 67 
      probands with a prior negative clinical PCR test for the FMR1, FXN, or DMPK 
      disease STR locus, or the spinocerebellar ataxia disease STR panel, our pipeline 
      did not falsely identify aberrant expansion. We performed clinical PCR tests on 
      seven (out of 10) full-mutation samples identified by our pipeline and confirmed 
      the expansion status in all, showing absolute concordance between our 
      bioinformatics and molecular findings. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully 
      demonstrated the application of a well-optimized bioinformatics pipeline that 
      promotes the utility of genome-wide sequencing as a first-tier screening test to 
      detect expansions of known disease STRs. Interrogating clinical next-generation 
      sequencing data for pathogenic STR expansions using our ensemble pipeline can 
      improve diagnostic yield and enhance clinical outcomes for patients with repeat 
      expansion disorders.

TI  - Cyclic mismatch binding ligands interact with disease-associated CGG 
      trinucleotide repeats in RNA and suppress their translation.
PG  - 9479-9495

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a limited expansion of CGG repeats in the 
      FMR1 gene. Degeneration of neurons in FXTAS cell models can be triggered by 
      accumulation of polyglycine protein (FMRpolyG), a by-product of translation 
      initiated upstream to the repeats. Specific aims of our work included testing if 
      naphthyridine-based molecules could (i) block FMRpolyG synthesis by binding to 
      CGG repeats in RNA, (ii) reverse pathological alterations in affected cells and 
      (iii) preserve the content of FMRP, translated from the same FMR1 mRNA. We 
      demonstrate that cyclic mismatch binding ligand CMBL4c binds to RNA structure 
      formed by CGG repeats and attenuates translation of FMRpolyG and formation of 
      nuclear inclusions in cells transfected with vectors expressing RNA with expanded 
      CGG repeats. Moreover, our results indicate that CMBL4c delivery can reduce 
      FMRpolyG-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Importantly, its therapeutic 
      potential is also observed once the inclusions are already formed. We also show 
      that CMBL4c-driven FMRpolyG loss is accompanied by partial FMRP reduction. As 
      complete loss of FMRP induces FXS in children, future experiments should aim at 
      evaluation of CMBL4c therapeutic intervention in differentiated tissues, in which 
      FMRpolyG translation inhibition might outweigh adverse effects related to FMRP 
      depletion.

TI  - Men with FMR1 premutation alleles of less than 71 CGG repeats have low risk of 
      being affected with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).
PG  - 706-709
LID - 10.1136/jmedgenet-2021-107758 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset condition 
      characterised by cerebellar ataxia and intention tremor, usually found in 
      individuals with FMR1 premutation alleles (PM-CGG expansion of 55-199 repeats). 
      Population studies estimate that between 1 in 250 and 1 in 1600 men have a PM, 
      with up to 45% of these men suggested to develop FXTAS by age 80. We used a 
      Bayesian approach to compare the probability of finding a specific PM genotype in 
      an ataxia population to a population control group and found an estimated 
      penetrance of <1% (0.031%; CI 0.007% to 0.141%) for men with </=70 CGGs. These 
      findings suggest that men with a PM of </=70 CGGs, who comprise the vast majority 
      of those with a PM, have a much lower risk of being affected with FXTAS than 
      previously suggested. This is an issue of growing importance for accurate genetic 
      counselling, as those with a PM of </=70 CGGs are increasingly detected through 
      community carrier screening or neurodevelopmental assessment programmes.

TI  - The influence of sex, genotype, and dose on serum and hippocampal cytokine levels 
      in juvenile mice developmentally exposed to a human-relevant mixture of 
      polychlorinated biphenyls.
PG  - 85-103
LID - 10.1016/j.crtox.2020.09.001 [doi]
AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are pervasive environmental contaminants 
      implicated as risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Immune 
      dysregulation is another NDD risk factor, and developmental PCB exposures are 
      associated with early life immune dysregulation. Studies of the immunomodulatory 
      effects of PCBs have focused on the higher-chlorinated congeners found in legacy 
      commercial mixtures. Comparatively little is known about the immune effects of 
      contemporary, lower-chlorinated PCBs. This is a critical data gap given recent 
      reports that lower-chlorinated congeners comprise >70% of the total PCB burden in 
      serum of pregnant women enrolled in the MARBLES study who are at increased risk 
      for having a child with an NDD. To examine the influence of PCBs, sex, and 
      genotype on cytokine levels, mice were exposed throughout gestation and lactation 
      to a PCB mixture in the maternal diet, which was based on the 12 most abundant 
      PCBs in sera from MARBLES subjects. Using multiplex array, cytokines were 
      quantified in the serum and hippocampus of weanling mice expressing either a 
      human gain-of-function mutation in ryanodine receptor 1 (T4826I mice), a human 
      CGG premutation repeat expansion in the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 (CGG 
      mice), or both mutations (DM mice). Congenic wildtype (WT) mice were used as 
      controls. There were dose-dependent effects of PCB exposure on cytokine 
      concentrations in the serum but not hippocampus. Differential effects of genotype 
      were observed in the serum and hippocampus. Hippocampal cytokines were 
      consistently elevated in T4826I mice and also in WT animals for some cytokines 
      compared to CGG and DM mice, while serum cytokines were usually elevated in the 
      mutant genotypes compared to the WT group. Males had elevated levels of 19 
      cytokines in the serum and 4 in the hippocampus compared to females, but there 
      were also interactions between sex and genotype for 7 hippocampal cytokines. Only 
      the chemokine CCL5 in the serum showed an interaction between PCB dose, genotype, 
      and sex. Collectively, these findings indicate differential influences of PCB 
      exposure and genotype on cytokine levels in serum and hippocampal tissue of 
      weanling mice. These results suggest that developmental PCB exposure has chronic 
      effects on baseline serum, but not hippocampal, cytokine levels in juvenile mice.

TI  - Folate Deficiency Triggers the Abnormal Segregation of a Region With Large 
      Cluster of CG-Rich Trinucleotide Repeats on Human Chromosome 2.
PG  - 695124
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2021.695124 [doi]
LID - 695124
AB  - Folate deficiency is associated with a broad range of human disorders, including 
      anemia, fetal neural tube defects, age-associated dementia and several types of 
      cancer. It is well established that a subgroup of rare fragile sites (RFSs) 
      containing expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat (TNR) sequences display instability 
      when cells are deprived of folate. However, given that folate sensitive RFSs 
      exist in a very small percentage of the population, they are unlikely to be the 
      cause of the widespread health problems associated with folate deficiency. We 
      hypothesized that folate deficiency could specifically affect DNA replication at 
      regions containing CG-rich repeat sequences. For this, we identified a region on 
      human chromosome 2 (Chr2) comprising more than 300 CG-rich TNRs (termed "FOLD1") 
      by examining the human genome database. Via the analysis of chromosome shape and 
      segregation in mitosis, we demonstrate that, when human cells are cultured under 
      folate stress conditions, Chr2 is prone to display a "kink" or "bending" at FOLD1 
      in metaphase and nondisjunction in anaphase. Furthermore, long-term folate 
      deprivation causes Chr2 aneuploidy. Our results provide new evidence on the 
      abnormalities folate deficiency could cause in human cells. This could facilitate 
      future studies on the deleterious health conditions associated with folate 
      deficiency.

      carriers: case series.
PG  - 687-690
LID - 10.1136/jmedgenet-2020-107609 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While an association between full mutation CGG-repeat expansions of 
      the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene and connective tissue problems are 
      clearly described, problems in fragile X premutation carriers (fXPCs) CGG-repeat 
      range (55-200 repeats) of the FMR1 gene may be overlooked. OBJECTIVE: To report 
      five FMR1 fXPCs cases with the hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) 
      phenotype. METHODS: We collected medical histories and FMR1 molecular measures 
      from five cases who presented with joint hypermobility and loose connective 
      tissue and met inclusion criteria for hEDS. RESULTS: Five cases were female and 
      ranged between 16 and 49 years. The range of CGG-repeat allele sizes ranged from 
      66 to 150 repeats. All had symptoms of hEDS since early childhood. Commonalities 
      in molecular pathogenesis and coexisting conditions between the fXPCs and hEDS 
      are also presented. The premutation can lead to a reduction of fragile X mental 
      retardation protein, which is crucial in maintaining functions of the 
      extracellular matrix-related proteins, particularly matrix metallopeptidase 9 and 
      elastin. Moreover, elevated FMR1 messenger RNA causes sequestration of proteins, 
      which results in RNA toxicity. CONCLUSION: Both hEDS phenotype and premutation 
      involvement may co-occur because of related commonalities in pathogenesis.

AB  - CGG expansions between 55 and 200 in the 5'-untranslated region of the fragile-X 
      mental retardation gene (FMR1) increase the risk of developing the late-onset 
      debilitating neuromuscular disease Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome 
      (FXTAS). While the science behind this mutation, as a paradigm for RNA-mediated 
      nucleotide triplet repeat expansion diseases, has progressed rapidly, no 
      treatment has proven effective at delaying the onset or decreasing morbidity, 
      especially at later stages of the disease. Here, we demonstrated the beneficial 
      effect of the phytochemical sulforaphane (SFN), exerted through NRF2-dependent 
      and independent manner, on pathways relevant to brain function, bioenergetics, 
      unfolded protein response, proteosome, antioxidant defenses, and iron metabolism 
      in fibroblasts from FXTAS-affected subjects at all disease stages. This study 
      paves the way for future clinical studies with SFN in the treatment of FXTAS, 
      substantiated by the established use of this agent in clinical trials of diseases 
      with NRF2 dysregulation and in which age is the leading risk factor.

      Community-Based Cohort.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Premutation-sized (55-200) CGG repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene 
      cause fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Most studies of 
      premutation carriers utilized reverse ascertainment to identify patients, leading 
      to a selection bias for larger repeats. As shorter CGG premutation repeats are 
      common in the population, understanding their impact on health outcomes has a 
      potentially large public health footprint. OBJECTIVE: The study's objective was 
      to compare an unselected group of premutation carriers (n = 35, 55-101 CGG 
      repeats) with matched controls (n = 61, 29-39 CGG repeats) with respect to 
      FXTAS-type signs using structured neurological assessments. METHODS: Three 
      neurologists independently rated signs, using an adapted version of the FXTAS 
      Rating Scale (Leehey MA, Berry-Kravis E, Goetz CG, et al. FMR1 CGG repeat length 
      predicts motor dysfunction in premutation carriers. Neurology. 2008). This was a 
      double-blind study, as genetic status (premutation vs. control) was known neither 
      by the participants nor by any of the neurologists. Analyses controlled 
      potentially confounding comorbid conditions in the electronic health record (eg, 
      osteoarthritis and stroke) and probed the association of age with signs. RESULTS: 
      Although there was no overall difference between carriers and controls, among 
      individuals without any potentially confounding comorbid diagnoses, there was a 
      statistically significant age-associated elevation in FXTAS-type signs in 
      premutation carriers compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Among those who do not 
      have other comorbid diagnoses, women who have CGG repeats at the lower end of the 
      premutation range may be at greater risk for ataxia and parkinsonism than their 
      age peers, although their overall risk of developing such clinical features is 
      low. This study should provide reassurance to those who share characteristics 
      with the present cohort. (c) 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder

TI  - Simultaneous Screening of the FRAXA and FRAXE Loci for Rapid Detection of FMR1 
      CGG and/or AFF2 CCG Repeat Expansions by Triplet-Primed PCR.

AB  - Moderate to hyper-expansion of trinucleotide repeats at the FRAXA and FRAXE 
      fragile sites, with or without concurrent hypermethylation, has been associated 
      with intellectual disability and other conditions. Unlike molecular diagnosis of 
      FMR1 CGG repeat expansions in FRAXA, current detection of AFF2 CCG repeat 
      expansions in FRAXE relies on low-throughput and otherwise inefficient techniques 
      combining Southern blot analysis and PCR. A novel triplet-primed PCR assay was 
      developed for simultaneous screening for trinucleotide repeat expansions at the 
      FRAXA and FRAXE fragile sites, and was validated using archived clinical samples 
      of known FMR1 and AFF2 genotypes. Population samples and FRAXE-affected samples 
      were sequenced for the evaluation of variations in the AFF2 CCG repeat structure. 
      The duplex assay accurately identified expansions at the FMR1 and AFF2 
      trinucleotide repeat loci. On Sanger sequencing of the AFF2 CCG repeat, the 
      single-nucleotide polymorphism variant rs868914124(C) that effectively adds two 
      CCG repeats at the 5'-end, was enriched in the Malay population and with short 
      repeats (<11 CCGs), and was present in all six expanded AFF2 alleles of this 
      study. All expanded AFF2 alleles contained multiple non-CCG interruptions toward 
      the 5'-end of the repeat. A sensitive, robust, and rapid assay has been developed 
      for the simultaneous detection of expansion mutations at the FMR1 and AFF2 
      trinucleotide repeat loci, simplifying screening for FRAXA- and FRAXE-associated 
      disorders.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor and ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset, 
      progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by tremors, ataxia and 
      neuropsychological problems. This disease is quite common in the general 
      population with approximately 20 million carriers worldwide. The risk of 
      developing FXTAS increases dramatically with age, with about 45% of male carriers 
      over the age of 50 being affected. FXTAS is caused by a CGG-repeat expansion 
      (CGGexp) in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. CGGexp RNA is 
      translated into the FMRpolyG protein by a mechanism called RAN translation. 
      Although both gene and pathogenic trigger are known, no therapeutic interventions 
      are available at this moment. Here, we present, for the first time, primary 
      hippocampal neurons derived from the ubiquitous inducible mouse model which is 
      used as a screening tool for targeted interventions. A promising candidate is the 
      repeat binding, RAN translation blocking, small molecule 1a. Small molecule 1a 
      shields the disease-causing CGGexp from being translated into the toxic FMRpolyG 
      protein. Primary hippocampal neurons formed FMRpolyG-positive inclusions, and 
      upon treatment with 1a, the numbers of FMRpolyG-positive inclusions are reduced. 
      We also describe for the first time the formation of FMRpolyG-positive inclusions 
      in the liver of this mouse model. Treatment with 1a reduced the insoluble 
      FMRpolyG protein fraction in the liver but not the number of inclusions. 
      Moreover, 1a treatment had a reducing effect on the number of Rad23b-positive 
      inclusions and insoluble Rad23b protein levels. These data suggest that targeted 
      small molecule therapy is effective in an FXTAS mouse model and has the potential 
      to treat CGGexp-mediated diseases, including FXTAS.

AB  - Non-coding repeat expansions, such as CGG, GGC, CUG, CCUG, and GGGGCC, have been 
      shown to be involved in many human diseases, particularly neurological disorders. 
      Of the diverse pathogenic mechanisms proposed in these neurodegenerative 
      diseases, dysregulated RNA metabolism has emerged as an important contributor. 
      Expanded repeat RNAs that form particular structures aggregate to form RNA foci, 
      sequestering various RNA binding proteins and consequently altering RNA splicing, 
      transport, and other downstream biological processes. One of these repeat 
      expansion-associated diseases, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS), is caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the 5'UTR region of the fragile X 
      mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Moreover, recent studies have revealed abnormal 
      GGC repeat expansion within the 5'UTR region of the NOTCH2NLC gene in both 
      essential tremor (ET) and neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). These 
      CGG repeat expansion-associated diseases share genetic, pathological, and 
      clinical features. Identification of the similarities at the molecular level 
      could lead to a better understanding of the disease mechanisms as well as 
      developing novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we highlight our current 
      understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of CGG repeat expansion-associated 
      diseases and discuss potential therapeutic interventions for these neurological 
      disorders.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), first described in 2001, is 
      a neurodegenerative and movement disorder, caused by a premutation in the fragile 
      X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. To date, the biological mechanisms causing 
      this condition are still not well understood, as not all premutation carriers 
      develop FXTAS. To further understand this syndrome, we quantitatively compared 
      the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome of FXTAS patients with age-matched 
      controls using mass spectrometry. We identified 415 proteins of which 97 were 
      altered in FXTAS patients. These proteins suggest changes in acute phase response 
      signaling, liver X receptor/ retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) activation, and 
      farnesoid X receptor (FXR)/RXR activation, which are the main pathways found to 
      be affected. Additionally, we detected changes in many other proteins including 
      amyloid-like protein 2, contactin-1, afamin, cell adhesion molecule 4, NPC 
      intracellular cholesterol transporter 2, and cathepsin B, that had been 
      previously noted to hold important roles in other movement disorders. Specific to 
      RXR pathways, several apolipoproteins (APOA1, APOA2, APOA4, APOC2, and APOD) 
      showed significant changes in the CSF of FXTAS patients. Lastly, CSF parameters 
      were analyzed to investigate abnormalities in blood brain barrier function. 
      Correlations were observed between patient albumin quotient values, a measure of 
      permeability, and CGG repeat length as well as FXTAS rating scale scores.

PG  - 800-807

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) has a classic phenotype, however its expression can be 
      variable among full mutation males. This is secondary to variable methylation 
      mosaicisms and the number of CGG triplet repeats in the non-coding region of the 
      Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, producing a variable expression of 
      the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). Here we report a family with 
      several individuals affected by FXS: a boy with a hypermethylated FMR1 mutation 
      and a classic phenotype; a man with an FMR1 gene mosaicism in the range of 
      premutation (PM) and full mutation (FM), who has a mild phenotype due to which 
      FXS was initially disregarded; and the cases of four women with a FM and 
      mosaicism. This report highlights the importance of DNA molecular testing for the 
      diagnosis of FXS in patients with developmental delay, intellectual disability 
      and/or autism due to the variable phenotype that occurs in individuals with FMR1 
      mosaicisms.

PG  - 923-938
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddab083 [doi]
AB  - Women heterozygous for an expansion of CGG repeats in the 5'UTR of FMR1 risk 
      developing fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) and/or 
      tremor and ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). We show that expanded CGGs, independent of 
      FMR1, are sufficient to drive ovarian insufficiency and that expression of 
      CGG-containing mRNAs alone or in conjunction with a polyglycine-containing 
      peptide translated from these RNAs contribute to dysfunction. Heterozygous 
      females from two mouse lines expressing either CGG RNA-only (RNA-only) or CGG RNA 
      and the polyglycine product FMRpolyG (FMRpolyG+RNA) were used to assess ovarian 
      function in aging animals. The expression of FMRpolyG+RNA led to early cessation 
      of breeding, ovulation and transcriptomic changes affecting cholesterol and 
      steroid hormone biosynthesis. Females expressing CGG RNA-only did not exhibit 
      decreased progeny during natural breeding, but their ovarian transcriptomes were 
      enriched for alterations in cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis. The enrichment of 
      CGG RNA-only ovaries for differentially expressed genes related to cholesterol 
      processing provided a link to the ovarian cysts observed in both CGG-expressing 
      lines. Early changes in transcriptome profiles led us to measure ovarian function 
      in prepubertal females that revealed deficiencies in ovulatory responses to 
      gonadotropins. These include impairments in cumulus expansion and resumption of 
      oocyte meiosis, as well as reduced ovulated oocyte number. Cumulatively, we 
      demonstrated the sufficiency of ectopically expressed CGG repeats to lead to 
      ovarian insufficiency and that co-expression of CGG-RNA and FMRpolyG lead to 
      premature cessation of breeding. However, the expression of CGG RNA-alone was 
      sufficient to lead to ovarian dysfunction by impairing responses to hormonal 
      stimulation.

AB  - CGG tandem repeat expansion in the 5'-untranslated region of the fragile X mental 
      retardation-1 (FMR1) gene leads to unusual nucleic acid conformations, hence 
      causing genetic instabilities. We show that the number of G...G (in CGG repeat) or 
      C...C (in CCG repeat) mismatches (other than A...T, T...A, C...G and G...C canonical base 
      pairs) dictates the secondary structural choice of the sense and antisense 
      strands of the FMR1 gene and their corresponding transcripts in fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). The circular dichroism (CD) spectra

      of the FMR1 gene) and its transcript favor a quadruplex structure. CD, EMSA and 
      molecular dynamics (MD) simulations also show that more than four C...C mismatches 
      cannot be accommodated in the RNA duplex consisting of the CCG repeat (antisense 
      transcript); instead, it favors an i-motif conformational intermediate. Such a 
      preference for unusual secondary structures provides a convincing justification 
      for the RNA foci formation due to the sequestration of RNA-binding proteins to 
      the bidirectional transcripts and the repeat-associated non-AUG translation that 
      are observed in FXTAS. The results presented here also suggest that small 
      molecule modulators that can destabilize FMR1 CGG DNA and RNA quadruplex 
      structures could be promising candidates for treating FXTAS.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset 
      neurodegenerative disease that develops in some premutation (PM) carriers of the 
      FMR1 gene with alleles bearing 55-200 CGG repeats. The discovery of a broad 
      spectrum of clinical and cell-developmental abnormalities among PM carriers with 
      or without FXTAS and in model systems suggests that neurodegeneration seen in 
      FXTAS could be the inevitable end-result of pathophysiological processes set 
      during early development. Hence, it is imperative to trace early PM-induced 
      pathological abnormalities. Previous studies have shown that transgenic 
      Drosophila carrying PM-length CGG repeats are sufficient to cause 
      neurodegeneration. Here, we used the same transgenic model to understand the 
      effect of CGG repeats on the structure and function of the developing nervous 
      system. We show that presynaptic expression of CGG repeats restricts synaptic 
      growth, reduces the number of synaptic boutons, leads to aberrant presynaptic 
      varicosities, and impairs synaptic transmission at the larval neuromuscular 
      junctions. The postsynaptic analysis shows that both glutamate receptors and 
      subsynaptic reticulum proteins were normal. However, a high percentage of boutons 
      show a reduced density of Bruchpilot protein, a key component of presynaptic 
      active zones required for vesicle release. The electrophysiological analysis 
      shows a significant reduction in quantal content, a measure of total synaptic 
      vesicles released per excitation potential. Together, these findings suggest that 
      synapse perturbation caused by riboCGG (rCGG) repeats mediates presynaptically 
      during larval neuromuscular junction development. We also suggest that the 
      stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase protein Basket and CIDE-N protein Drep-2 
      positively mediate Bruchpilot active zone defects caused by rCGG repeats.

AB  - CGG repeat expansions within the premutation range (55-200) of the FMR1 gene can 
      lead to Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome and Fragile X-associated 
      neuropsychiatric disorders. These CGG repeats are translated into a toxic 
      polyglycine-containing protein, FMRpolyG. Pathology of Fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome and Fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders 
      comprises FMRpolyG- and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions. Diagnosing a 
      FMR1-premutation carrier remains challenging, as the clinical features overlap 
      with other neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we describe two male cases with 
      Fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders-related symptoms and mild 
      movement disturbances and novel pathological features that can attribute to the 
      variable phenotype. Macroscopically, both donors did not show characteristic 
      white matter lesions on MRI; however, vascular infarcts in cortical- and 
      sub-cortical regions were identified. Immunohistochemistry analyses revealed a 
      high number of FMRpolyG intranuclear inclusions throughout the brain, which were 
      also positive for p62. Importantly, we identified a novel pathological vascular 
      phenotype with inclusions present in pericytes and endothelial cells. Although 
      these results need to be confirmed in more cases, we propose that these vascular 
      lesions in the brain could contribute to the complex symptomology of 
      FMR1-premutation carriers. Overall, our report suggests that Fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome and Fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders may 
      present diverse clinical involvements resembling other types of dementia, and in 
      the absence of genetic testing, FMRpolyG can be used post-mortem to identify 
      premutation carriers.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent form of inherited intellectual 
      disability and the best-described monogenic cause of autism. CGG-repeat expansion 
      in the FMR1 gene leads to FMR1 silencing, loss-of-expression of the Fragile X 
      Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), and is a common cause of FXS. Missense 
      mutations in the FMR1 gene were also identified in FXS patients, including the 
      recurrent FMRP-R138Q mutation. To investigate the mechanisms underlying FXS 
      caused by this mutation, we generated a knock-in mouse model (Fmr1(R138Q)) 
      expressing the FMRP-R138Q protein. We demonstrate that, in the hippocampus of the 
      Fmr1(R138Q) mice, neurons show an increased spine density associated with 
      synaptic ultrastructural defects and increased AMPA receptor-surface expression. 
      Combining biochemical assays, high-resolution imaging, electrophysiological 
      recordings, and behavioural testing, we also show that the R138Q mutation results 
      in impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation and socio-cognitive deficits in 
      mice. These findings reveal the functional impact of the FMRP-R138Q mutation in a 
      mouse model of FXS.

TI  - Clinical Characteristics of Fragile X Syndrome Patients in Japan.
PG  - 30-33
LID - 10.33160/yam.2021.02.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a well-known X-linked disorder clinically 
      characterized by intellectual disability and autistic features. However, 
      diagnosed Japanese FXS cases have been fewer than expected, and clinical features 
      of Japanese FXS patients remain unknown. METHODS: We evaluated the clinical 
      features of Japanese FXS patients using the results of a questionnaire-based 
      survey. RESULTS: We presented the characteristics of seven patients aged 6 to 20 
      years. Long face and large ears were observed in five of seven patients. 
      Macrocephaly was observed in four of five patients. The meaningful word was first 
      seen at a certain time point between 18 and 72 months (median = 60 months). 
      Developmental quotient or intellectual quotient ranged between 20 and 48 (median 
      = 29). Behavioral disorders were seen in all patients (autistic spectrum disorder 
      in six patients, hyperactivity in five patients). Five patients were diagnosed by 
      polymerase chain reaction analysis, and two patients were diagnosed by the 
      cytogenetic study. All physicians ordered FXS genetic testing for suspicious 
      cases because of clinical manifestations. CONCLUSION: In the present study, a 
      long face, large ears, macrocephaly, autistic spectrum disorder, and 
      hyperactivity were observed in almost cases, and these characteristics might be 
      common features in Japanese FXS patients. Our finding indicated the importance of 
      clinical manifestations to diagnosis FXS. However, the sample size of the present 
      study is small, and these features are also seen to patients with other 
      disorders. We consider that genetic testing for FXS should be performed on a 
      wider range of intellectually disabled cases.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is an incurable 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of CGG repeats in the FMR1 5'UTR. 
      The RNA containing expanded CGG repeats (rCGG(exp)) causes cell damage by 
      interaction with complementary DNA, forming R-loop structures, sequestration of 
      nuclear proteins involved in RNA metabolism and initiation of translation of 
      polyglycine-containing protein (FMRpolyG), which forms nuclear insoluble 
      inclusions. Here we show the therapeutic potential of short antisense 
      oligonucleotide steric blockers (ASOs) targeting directly the rCGG(exp). In 
      nuclei of FXTAS cells ASOs affect R-loop formation and correct miRNA biogenesis 
      and alternative splicing, indicating that nuclear proteins are released from 
      toxic sequestration. In cytoplasm, ASOs significantly decrease the biosynthesis 
      and accumulation of FMRpolyG. Delivery of ASO into a brain of FXTAS mouse model 
      reduces formation of inclusions, improves motor behavior and corrects gene 
      expression profile with marginal signs of toxicity after a few weeks from a 
      treatment.

AB  - Background: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is an adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder associated with premutation CGG-repeat expansions 
      (55-200 repeats) in the 5' non-coding portion of the fragile X mental retardation 
      1 (FMR1) gene. Core features of FXTAS include progressive tremor/ataxia, 
      cognitive decline, variable brain volume loss, and white matter disease. The 
      principal histopathological feature of FXTAS is the presence of central nervous 
      system (CNS) and non-CNS intranuclear inclusions. Objective: To further elucidate 
      the molecular underpinnings of FXTAS through the proteomic characterization of 
      human FXTAS cortexes. Results: Proteomic analysis of FXTAS brain cortical tissue 
      (n = 8) identified minor differences in protein abundance compared to control 
      brains (n = 6). Significant differences in FXTAS relative to control brain 
      predominantly involved decreased abundance of proteins, with the greatest 
      decreases observed for tenascin-C (TNC), cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38), 
      and phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1); proteins typically increased in 
      other neurodegenerative diseases. Proteins with the greatest increased abundance 
      include potentially novel neurodegeneration-related proteins and small 
      ubiquitin-like modifier 1/2 (SUMO1/2). The FMRpolyG peptide, proposed in models 
      of FXTAS pathogenesis but only identified in trace amounts in the earlier study 
      of FXTAS inclusions, was not identified in any of the FXTAS or control brains in 
      the current study. Discussion: The observed proteomic shifts, while generally 
      relatively modest, do show a bias toward decreased protein abundance with FXTAS. 
      Such shifts in protein abundance also suggest altered RNA binding as well as loss 
      of cell-cell adhesion/structural integrity. Unlike other neurodegenerative 
      diseases, the proteome of end-stage FXTAS does not suggest a strong 
      inflammation-mediated degenerative response.

AB  - Fragile X-related tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by CGG triplet repeat expansions in FMR1, which elicit repeat-associated 
      non-AUG (RAN) translation and produce the toxic protein FMRpolyG. We show that 
      FMRpolyG interacts with pathogenic CGG repeat-derived RNA G-quadruplexes 
      (CGG-G4RNA), propagates cell to cell, and induces neuronal dysfunction. The 
      FMRpolyG polyglycine domain has a prion-like property, preferentially binding to 
      CGG-G4RNA. Treatment with 5-aminolevulinic acid, which is metabolized to 
      protoporphyrin IX, inhibited RAN translation of FMRpolyG and CGG-G4RNA-induced 
      FMRpolyG aggregation, ameliorating aberrant synaptic plasticity and behavior in 
      FXTAS model mice. Thus, we present a novel therapeutic strategy to target G4RNA 
      prionoids.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a progressive 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of 55 to 200 CGG repeats 
      located within 5'UTR of FMR1.These CGG repeats are transcribed into RNAs, which 
      sequester several RNA binding proteins and alter the processing of miRNAs. CGG 
      repeats are also translated into a toxic polyglycine-containing protein, 
      FMRpolyG, that affects mitochondrial and nuclear functions reported in cell and 
      animal models and patient studies. Nuclear-encoded small non-coding RNAs, 
      including miRNAs, are transported to mitochondria; however, the role of 
      mitochondrial miRNAs in FXTAS pathogenesis is not understood. Here, we analyzed 
      mitochondrial miRNAs from HEK293 cells expressing expanded CGG repeats and their 
      implication in the regulation of mitochondrial functions. The analysis of next 
      generation sequencing (NGS) data of small RNAs from HEK293 cells expressing CGG 
      premutation showed decreased level of cellular miRNAs and an altered pattern of 
      association of miRNAs with mitochondria (mito-miRs). Among such mito-miRs, 
      miR-320a was highly enriched in mitoplast and RNA immunoprecipitation of Ago2 
      (Argonaute-2) followed by Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)suggested that miR-320a may 
      form a complex with Ago2 and mitotranscripts. Finally, transfection of miR-320a 
      mimic in cells expressing CGG permutation recovers mitochondrial functions and 
      rescues cell death. Overall, this work reveals an altered translocation of miRNAs 
      to mitochondria and the role of miR-320a in FXTAS pathology.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a rare neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a 55-200 CGG repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region of 
      the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. FXTAS is characterized by 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia, Parkinsonism, intention tremors and cognitive 
      decline. The main neuropathological hallmark of FXTAS is the presence of 
      ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions in neurons and astrocytes throughout 
      the brain. The molecular pathology of FXTAS involves the presence of 2 to 8-fold 
      elevated levels of FMR1 mRNA, and of a repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translated 
      polyglycine peptide (FMRpolyG). Increased levels of FMR1 mRNA containing an 
      expanded CGG repeat can result in cellular toxicity by an RNA gain-of-function 
      mechanism. The increased levels of CGG repeat-expanded FMR1 transcripts may 
      create RNA foci that sequester important cellular proteins, including RNA-binding 
      proteins and FMRpolyG, in intranuclear inclusions. To date, it is unclear whether 
      the FMRpolyG-positive intranuclear inclusions are a cause or a consequence of 
      FXTAS disease pathology. In this report we studied the relation between the 
      presence of neuronal intranuclear inclusions and behavioral deficits using an 
      inducible mouse model for FXTAS. Neuronal intranuclear inclusions were observed 4 
      weeks after dox-induction. After 12 weeks, high numbers of FMRpolyG-positive 
      intranuclear inclusions could be detected in the hippocampus and striatum, but no 
      clear signs of behavioral deficits related to these specific brain regions were 
      found. In conclusion, the observations in our inducible mouse model for FXTAS 
      suggest a lack of correlation between the presence of intranuclear 
      FMRpolyG-positive aggregates in brain regions and specific behavioral phenotypes.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative 
      disorder associated with a premutation cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion of the FMR1 gene. FXTAS is estimated to be the 
      most common single-gene form of ataxia in the aging population. Gait ataxia and 
      intention tremor are the primary behavioral symptoms of FXTAS, though clinical 
      evaluation of these symptoms often is subjective, contributing to difficulties in 
      reliably differentiating individuals with FXTAS and asymptomatic premutation 
      carriers. This study aimed to clarify the extent to which quantitative measures 
      of gait and upper limb kinematics may serve as biobehavioral markers of FXTAS 
      degeneration. Nineteen premutation carriers (aged 46-77 years), including 9 with 
      possible, probable, or definite FXTAS and 16 sex- and IQ-matched healthy 
      controls, completed tests of non-constrained walking and reaching while both 
      standing (static reaching) and walking (dynamic reaching) to quantify gait and 
      upper limb control, respectively. For the non-constrained walking task, 
      participants wore reflective markers and walked at their preferred speed on a 
      walkway. During the static reaching task, participants reached and lifted boxes 
      of different sizes while standing. During the dynamic reaching task, participants 
      walked to reach and lift the boxes. Movement kinematics were examined in relation 
      to clinical ratings of neuromotor impairments and CGG repeat length. During 
      non-constrained walking, individuals with FXTAS showed decreased stride lengths 
      and stride velocities, increased percentages of double support time, and 
      increased variabilities of cadence and center of mass relative to both 
      asymptomatic premutation carriers and controls. While individuals with FXTAS did 
      not show any static reaching differences relative to the other two groups, they 
      showed multiple differences during dynamic reaching trials, including reduced 
      maximum reaching velocity, prolonged acceleration time, and jerkier movement of 
      the shoulder, elbow, and hand. Gait differences during non-constrained walking 
      were associated with more severe clinically rated posture and gait symptoms. 
      Reduced maximum reaching velocity and increased jerkiness during dynamic reaching 
      were each related to more severe clinically rated kinetic dysfunction and overall 
      neuromotor symptoms in FMR1 premutation carriers. Our findings suggest kinematic 
      alterations consistent with gait ataxia and upper limb bradykinesia are each 
      selectively present in individuals with FXTAS, but not asymptomatic aging 
      premutation carriers. Consistent with neuropathological and magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) studies of FXTAS, these findings implicate cerebellar and basal 
      ganglia degeneration associated with neuromotor decline. Our results showing 
      associations between quantitative kinematic differences in FXTAS and clinical 
      ratings suggest that objective assessments of gait and reaching behaviors may 
      serve as critical and reliable targets for detecting FXTAS risk and monitoring 
      progression.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inheritable form of intellectual 
      disability. FMR1, the gene responsible for FXS, is located on human chromosome 
      Xq27.3 and contains a stretch of CGG trinucleotide repeats in its 5' untranslated 
      region. FXS is caused by CGG repeats that expand beyond 200, resulting in FMR1 
      silencing via promoter hypermethylation. The molecular mechanism underlying CGG 
      repeat expansion, a fundamental cause of FXS, remains poorly understood, partly 
      due to a lack of experimental systems. Accumulated evidence indicates that the 
      large chromosomal region flanking a CGG repeat is critical for repeat dynamics. 
      In the present study, we isolated and introduced whole human X chromosomes from 
      healthy, FXS premutation carriers, or FXS patients who carried disease 
      condition-associated CGG repeat lengths, into mouse A9 cells via 
      microcell-mediated chromosome transfer. The CGG repeat length-associated 
      methylation status and human FMR1 expression in these monochromosomal hybrid 
      cells mimicked those in humans. Thus, this set of A9 cells containing CGG repeats 
      from three different origins (FXS-A9 panel) may provide a valuable resource for 
      investigating a series of genetic and epigenetic CGG repeat dynamics during FXS 
      pathogenesis.

AB  - The X-linked FMR1 premutation (PM) is characterized by a 55-200 CGG triplet 
      expansion in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR). Carriers of the PM were originally 
      thought to be asymptomatic; however, they may present general neuropsychiatric 
      manifestations including learning disabilities, depression and anxiety, among 
      others. With age, both sexes may also develop the neurodegenerative disease 
      fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Among carriers, females are 
      at higher risk for developing immune disorders, hypertension, seizures, endocrine 
      disorders and chronic pain, among others. Some female carriers younger than 40 
      years old may develop fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). 
      To date, no studies have addressed the metabolic footprint - that includes 
      mitochondrial metabolism - of female carriers and its link to clinical/cognitive 
      manifestations. To this end, we performed a comprehensive biochemical assessment 
      of 42 female carriers (24-70 years old) compared to sex-matched non-carriers. By 
      applying a multivariable correlation matrix, a generalized bioenergetics 
      impairment was correlated with diagnoses of the PM, FXTAS and its severity, FXPOI 
      and anxiety. Intellectual deficits were strongly correlated with both 
      mitochondrial dysfunction and with CGG repeat length. A combined multi-omics 
      approach identified a down-regulation of RNA and mRNA metabolism, translation, 
      carbon and protein metabolism, unfolded protein response, and up-regulation of 
      glycolysis and antioxidant response. The suboptimal activation of the unfolded 
      protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation 
      (ERAD) response challenges and further compromises the PM genetic background to 
      withstand other, more severe forms of stress. Mechanistically, some of the 
      deficits were linked to an altered protein expression due to decreased protein 
      translation, but others seemed secondary to oxidative stress originated from the

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common monogenetic cause of intellectual 
      disability and autism spectrum disorders. Mostly, FXS is caused by 
      transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene due to a repeat expansion in the 5' 
      UTR, and consequently lack of the protein product FMRP. However, in rare cases 
      FXS is caused by other types of variants in the FMR1 gene. We describe a missense 
      variant in the FMR1 gene, identified through whole-exome sequencing, in a boy 
      with intellectual disability and behavioral problems. The variant is located in 
      the FMRP's nuclear export signal (NES). We performed expression and localization 
      studies of the variant in hair roots and HEK293 cells. Our results show normal 
      expression but significant retention of the FMRP in the cells' nucleus. This 
      finding suggests a possible FMRP reduction at its essential functional sites in 
      the dendrites and the synaptic compartments and possible interference of other 
      cellular processes in the nucleus. Together, this might lead to a FXS phenotype 
      in the boy.

TI  - Label-free Electrochemical Detection of CGG Repeats on Inkjet Printable 2D Layers 
      of MoS(2).
PG  - 52156-52165
LID - 10.1021/acsami.0c14912 [doi]
AB  - Flexible and ultrasensitive biosensing platforms capable of detecting a large 
      number of trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) are crucial for future technology 
      development needed to combat a variety of genetic disorders. For example, 
      trinucleotide CGG repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene can cause Fragile X syndrome 
      (FXS) and Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Current 
      state-of-the-art technologies to detect repeat sequences are expensive, while 
      relying on complicated procedures, and prone to false negatives. We reasoned that 
      two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum sulfide (MoS(2)) surfaces may be useful for 
      label-free electrochemical detection of CGG repeats due to its high affinity for 
      guanine bases. Here, we developed a low-cost and sensitive wax-on-plastic 
      electrochemical sensor using 2D MoS(2) ink for the detection of CGG repeats. The 
      ink containing few-layered MoS(2) nanosheets was prepared and characterized using 
      optical, electrical, electrochemical, and electron microscopic methods. The 
      devices were characterized by electron microscopic and electrochemical methods. 
      Repetitive CGG DNA was adsorbed on a MoS(2) surface in a high cationic strength 
      environment and the electrocatalytic current of the CGG/MoS(2) interface was 
      recorded using a soluble Fe(CN)(6)(-3/-4) redox probe by differential pulse 
      voltammetry (DPV). The dynamic range for the detection of prehybridized duplexes 
      ranged from 1 aM to 100 nM with a 3.0 aM limit of detection. A detection range of 
      100 fM to 1 nM was recorded for surface hybridization events. Using this method, 
      we were able to observe selectivity of MoS(2) for CGG repeats and distinguish 
      nonpathogenic from disease-associated repeat lengths. The detection of CGG repeat 
      sequences on inkjet printable 2D MoS(2) surfaces is a forward step toward 
      developing chip-based rapid and label-free sensors for the detection of repeat 
      expansion sequences.

AB  - Around 20-28% of FMR1gene CGG premutation (PM) carriers are at augmented risk 
      towards an infertility related disorder, Fragile X-associated primary ovarian 
      insufficiency (FXPOI). Except the effect of CGG repeats, reports are not 
      available on the mechanism through which the cis-acting variations, namely, SNPs 
      involved in POI susceptibility. Addressing the hypothesis that the FMR1 gene 
      polymorphisms [CGG repeats, rs25731(T > A) and rs4949(A > G)] might increase 
      their individual and combined impact in disease predisposition, we tested the 
      genetic variants in 200 south Indian DNA samples consists of 100 patients and 100 
      healthy volunteers. We used gene scan method to score the CGG repeat length, and 
      ARMS and RFLP methods to genotype the SNPs. Only 0.5% of each Gray zone and PM 
      alleles were found among patient group, however, no disease association was 
      noticed with repeat length. The rs25731 showed protection [OR:0.32; (0.13-0.76), 
      p = 0.006] and rs4949 reported a 2.5-fold risk towards the disease predisposition 
      [OR:2.46; (1.06-5.74), p = 0.031] but, both found insignificant after Bonferroni 
      correction was done under different Genetic Models. Novel classification of 
      genotype combinations, 'Normal&Variant Homozygote' [OR:2.89,(1.12-7.9), p < 0.05] 
      and 'Allele2-T-G' haplotype block (6%vs.1%, p = 0.08) were noticed to be at 
      marginal risk for POI. We demonstrated a susceptible role of the combined effect 
      of variant allele-G and Allele-2 (repeat allele outside the normal range) for 
      FXPOI. To support our findings of its first kind, further studies with large 
      samples are warranted in understanding the role of FMR1 genetic variants in FXPOI 
      etio-pathophysiology, the outcome might help in providing better reproductive 
      treatment options for females, who are at risk for FXPOI.

      Analyses in Fragile X Patients with Neurobehavioral Assessments.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci10100694 [doi]
LID - 694
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by silencing of the FMR1 gene, which encodes a 
      protein with a critical role in synaptic plasticity. The molecular abnormality 
      underlying FMR1 silencing, CGG repeat expansion, is well characterized; however, 
      delineation of the pathway from DNA to RNA to protein using biosamples from well 
      characterized patients with FXS is limited. Since FXS is a common and 
      prototypical genetic disorder associated with intellectual disability (ID) and 
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a comprehensive assessment of the FMR1 
      DNA-RNA-protein pathway and its correlations with the neurobehavioral phenotype 
      is a priority. We applied nine sensitive and quantitative assays evaluating FMR1 
      DNA, RNA, and FMRP parameters to a reference set of cell lines representing the 
      range of FMR1 expansions. We then used the most informative of these assays on 
      blood and buccal specimens from cohorts of patients with different FMR1 
      expansions, with emphasis on those with FXS (N = 42 total, N = 31 with FMRP 
      measurements). The group with FMRP data was also evaluated comprehensively in 
      terms of its neurobehavioral profile, which allowed molecular-neurobehavioral 
      correlations. FMR1 CGG repeat expansions, methylation levels, and FMRP levels, in 
      both cell lines and blood samples, were consistent with findings of previous FMR1 
      genomic and protein studies. They also demonstrated a high level of agreement 
      between blood and buccal specimens. These assays further corroborated previous 
      reports of the relatively high prevalence of methylation mosaicism (slightly over 
      50% of the samples). Molecular-neurobehavioral correlations confirmed the inverse 
      relationship between overall severity of the FXS phenotype and decrease in FMRP 
      levels (N = 26 males, mean 4.2 +/- 3.3 pg FMRP/ng genomic DNA). Other intriguing 
      findings included a significant relationship between the diagnosis of FXS with 
      ASD and two-fold lower levels of FMRP (mean 2.8 +/- 1.3 pg FMRP/ng genomic DNA, p = 
      0.04), in particular observed in younger age- and IQ-adjusted males (mean age 6.9 
      +/- 0.9 years with mean 3.2 +/- 1.2 pg FMRP/ng genomic DNA, 57% with severe ASD), 
      compared to FXS without ASD. Those with severe ID had even lower FMRP levels 
      independent of ASD status in the male-only subset. The results underscore the 
      link between FMR1 expansion, gene methylation, and FMRP deficit. The association 
      between FMRP deficiency and overall severity of the neurobehavioral phenotype 
      invites follow up studies in larger patient cohorts. They would be valuable to 
      confirm and potentially extend our initial findings of the relationship between 
      ASD and other neurobehavioral features and the magnitude of FMRP deficit. 
      Molecular profiling of individuals with FXS may have important implications in 
      research and clinical practice.

AB  - The expansion of trinucleotide CGG repeats in the promoter of fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) gene is associated with fragile X and fragile X associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndromes. While the expansion of CGG repeats has been associated 
      with such neuro/psychiatric diseases, the contraction of CGG repeats has been 
      recently suggested as an indication of ovarian dysfunction. This study aimed to 
      evaluate a possible association of the short CGG repeats with poor ovarian 
      responders (POR) and to test for a possible correlation between the CGG size and 
      different known markers of the ovarian reserve, namely FSH, AMH, and the number 
      of retrieved oocytes from Jordanian females. We found a significant difference 
      between the CGG median allele size between the cases and the controls 
      (p < 0.001), where poor ovarian responders had shorter CGG repeats compared to 
      the healthy controls. Also, females with alleles <26 had twice the odds to be 
      presented in the POR compared to the controls. However, we did not find a 
      significant correlation between CGG sizes and the markers of ovarian reserve. We 
      conclude that although low CGG repeats appear to be linked to POR, the clinical 
      utility of FMR1 for predicting ovarian response needs further investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that there is an association between FMR1 
      CGG repeats and ovarian dysfunction. The aim of this study is to assess the 
      association between the number of CGG repeats in FMR1 in Chinese patients with 
      premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). 
      METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, case-control study, which enrolled 124 
      patients with POI, 57 patients with DOR and 111 normal menopausal controls. The 
      demographic details along with other clinical data were recorded. The FMR1 CGG 
      repeats were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and microfluidic capillary 
      electrophoresis. RESULTS: We could detect two premutation carriers in the POI 
      group (1.6%) and one in the control group (0.9%). No premutation carriers were 
      identified in the DOR group. The frequency of FMR1 premutations was not different 
      between POI or DOR and controls. The most common CGG repeat was 29 and 30, and 
      the repeat length for allele 2 had a secondary peak around 36-39 repeats. The CGG 
      repeats were divided into groups of five consecutive values, and the distribution 
      of allele 1 in the POI group was different from that in the control group 
      (P < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were found for allele 1 
      between DOR group vs. controls, and for allele 2 between three groups (P > 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that the frequency of FMR1 premutations is 
      relatively low (1.6%) in Chinese women with POI. The distribution of allele 1 CGG 
      repeat in patients with POI showed difference from that in healthy women.

PG  - 527-531

AB  - Aims: Fragile-X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual 
      disability; it is caused by an abnormal CGG-repeat expansion at the FMR1 gene. 
      However, a few cases of girls with mutations in the FMR1 gene have been reported 
      in the literature. In this study, we describe the clinical and genetic assessment 
      of a family who exhibits the unusual coexistence of FXS, an 8p23.1 deletion, and 
      balanced translocation t(7;10)(p10;q24) in multiple members, including a 
      symptomatic girl with FXS. Materials and Methods: All of the family members 
      underwent comprehensive clinical and neurological examinations. All members of 
      the family were also molecularly diagnosed using a combination of 
      fluorescent-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Triplet Repeat Primed-PCR, capillary 
      electrophoresis, and karyotyping. Results: We identified a male proband and a 
      female patient that presented with the craniofacial characteristics of FXS, 
      neuropsychomotor developmental delay, speech delay, intellectual deficit, and a 
      positive molecular diagnosis of FXS. Interestingly, the female patient presented 
      with a severe phenotype also associated with the presence of 8p23.1 deletion, 
      while the proband patient presented a balanced translocation t(7;10)(p10;q24). 
      Moreover, we detected multiple carriers of the FXS premutation in the family. 
      Conclusions: To our knowledge, we describe for the first time the simultaneous 
      occurrence of FXS and an 8p23.1 deletion and their possible synergistic effects 
      on the phenotype of a female patient. Moreover, we describe the coexistence of 
      FXS, an 8p23.1 deletion, and a balanced translocation t(7;10)(p10;q24) in the 
      same family.

AB  - The Fragile-X related disorders (FXDs) are Repeat Expansion Diseases (REDs) that 
      result from expansion of a CGG-repeat tract located at the 5' end of the FMR1 
      gene. While expansion affects transmission risk and can also affect disease risk 
      and severity, the underlying molecular mechanism responsible is unknown. Despite 
      the fact that expanded alleles can be seen both in humans and mouse models in 
      vivo, existing patient-derived cells do not show significant repeat expansions 
      even after extended periods in culture. In order to develop a good tissue culture 
      model for studying expansions we tested whether mouse embryonic stem cells 
      (mESCs) carrying an expanded CGG repeat tract in the endogenous Fmr1 gene are 
      permissive for expansion. We show here that these mESCs have a very high 
      frequency of expansion that allows changes in the repeat number to be seen within 
      a matter of days. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of these cells suggests that this may 
      be due in part to the fact that non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), which is able 
      to protect against expansions in some cell types, is not effective in mESCs. 
      CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing also shows that these expansions are MSH2-dependent, 
      consistent with those seen in vivo. While comparable human Genome Wide 
      Association (GWA) studies are not available for the FXDs, such studies have 
      implicated MSH2 in expansion in other REDs. The shared unusual requirement for 
      MSH2 for this type of microsatellite instability suggests that this new 
      cell-based system is relevant for understanding the mechanism responsible for 
      this peculiar type of mutation in humans. The high frequency of expansions and 
      the ease of gene editing these cells should expedite the identification of 
      factors that affect expansion risk. Additionally, we found that, as with cells 
      from human premutation (PM) carriers, these cell lines have elevated 
      mitochondrial copy numbers and Fmr1 hyperexpression, that we show here is 
      O(2)-sensitive. Thus, this new stem cell model should facilitate studies of both 
      repeat expansion and the consequences of expansion during early embryonic 
      development.

AB  - The major and most well-studied genetic cause of Fragile-X syndrome (FXS) is 
      expansion of a CGG repeat in the 5'-UTR of the FMR1 gene. Routine testing for 
      this expansion is performed globally. Overall, there is a paucity of intragenic 
      variants explaining FXS, a fact which is being addressed by a more systematic 
      application of whole exome (WES) and whole genome (WGS) sequencing, even in the 
      diagnostic setting. Here we report two families comprising probands with a 
      clinical suspicion of FXS and no CGG repeat expansions. Using WES/WGS we 
      identified deleterious variants within the coding region of FMR1 in both 
      families. In a family from Finland we identified a complex indel 
      c.1021-1028delinsTATTGG in exon 11 of FMR1 which gives rise to a frameshift and a 
      premature termination codon (PTC), p.Asn341Tyrfs*7. Follow-up mRNA and protein 
      studies on a cell line from the proband revealed that although the mRNA levels of 
      FMR1 were not altered, Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 Protein (FMRP) was 
      undetectable. Additionally, we identified a variant, c.881-1G > T, affecting the 
      canonical acceptor splice site of exon 10 of FMR1 in an Australian family. Our 
      findings reinforce the importance of intragenic FMR1 variant testing, 
      particularly in cases with clinical features of FXS and no CGG repeat expansions 
      identified.

AB  - Expansion of a CGG-repeat tract in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene 
      causes the fragile X-related disorders (FXDs; aka the FMR1 disorders). The 
      expansion mechanism is likely shared by the 35+ other diseases resulting from 
      expansion of a disease-specific microsatellite, but many steps in this process 
      are unknown. We have shown previously that expansion is dependent upon functional 
      mismatch repair proteins, including an absolute requirement for MutLgamma, one of the 
      three MutL heterodimeric complexes found in mammalian cells. We demonstrate here 
      that both MutLalpha and MutLbeta, the two other MutL complexes present in mammalian 
      cells, are also required for most, if not all, expansions in a mouse embryonic 
      stem cell model of the FXDs. A role for MutLalpha and MutLbeta is consistent with human 
      GWA studies implicating these complexes as modifiers of expansion risk in other 
      Repeat Expansion Diseases. The requirement for all three complexes suggests a 
      novel model in which these complexes co-operate to generate expansions. It also 
      suggests that the PMS1 subunit of MutLbeta may be a reasonable therapeutic target in 
      those diseases in which somatic expansion is an important disease modifier.

AB  - The FMR1 gene on the X chromosome has varying numbers of CGG repeats. The modal 
      number is 30, and expansion to >200 results in fragile X syndrome, but the copy 
      number extends down to 6. Past research suggests that individuals whose CGGs are 
      in the "low zone" (LZ; defined here as </= 25 CGGs) may be more 
      environmentally-reactive than those with normal range repeats (26-40 CGGs)-a gene 
      x environment interaction. Using a population-based DNA biobank, in our primary 
      analysis we compared 96 mothers with LZ CGG repeats on both alleles to 280 
      mothers who had CGG repeats in the normal range. Secondarily, we conducted 
      parallel analyses on fathers. We investigated how parents in these two CGG repeat 
      categories differentially responded to stress, defined as parenting a child with 
      disabilities. Significant gene x environment interactions indicated that LZ 
      mothers who had children with disabilities had greater limitations (in executive 
      functioning, depression, anxiety, daily health symptoms, and balance) than LZ 
      mothers whose children did not have disabilities. In contrast, mothers with 
      normal-range CGG repeats did not differ based on stress exposure. For fathers, a 
      similar pattern was evident for one phenotype only (hand tremors). Although on 
      average LZ CGGs are not associated with compromised functioning, the average 
      masks differential response to the environment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a monogenic disorder and a common cause 
      of intellectual disability (ID). Up to now, very few pathological variants other 
      than the typical CGG-repeat expansion have been reported in the FMR1 gene. 
      METHODS: A panel of 56 intellectual disability (ID) genes including the FMR1 gene 
      was sequenced in a cohort of 300 patients with unexplained ID. To determine the 
      effect of a new FMR1 variant, total RNA from peripheral blood cells was reverse 
      transcribed, amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. RESULTS: We 
      report a novel G to A point variant (c.801G > A) located at the last nucleotide 
      of exon 8 in the FMR1 gene in one patient with ID. Direct sequencing of the 
      RT-PCR products revealed that the transcript from the allele with G to A variant 
      skips exon 8 entirely, resulting in a joining of exons 7 and 9. Skipping of exon 
      8 may result in an abnormal FMR1 protein (FMRP), which removes the highly 
      conserved region that encoding the KH1 domain of FMRP. CONCLUSIONS: This report 
      describes for the first time that a synonymous variant in the FMR1 gene is 
      associated with an error in mRNA processing, leading preferentially to the 
      production of an aberrant transcript without exon 8. This splice variant was 
      associated with an unspecific clinical presentation, suggesting the need for more 
      detailed investigation of silent variants in ID patients with a large spectrum of 
      phenotypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of 
      intellectual disability caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated 
      region of the FMR1 gene. When the number of repeats exceeds 200, the gene becomes 
      hypermethylated and is transcriptionally silenced, resulting in FXS. Other 
      allelic forms of the gene that are studied because of their instability or 
      phenotypic consequence include intermediate alleles (45-54 CGG repeats) and 
      premutation alleles (55-200 repeats). Normal alleles are classified as having <45 
      CGG repeats. Population screening studies have been conducted among American and 
      Australian populations; however, large population-based studies have not been 
      completed in China. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this work we present FXS screening 
      results from 10,145 women of childbearing age from China. We first created and 
      tested a standard panel that was comprised of normal, intermediate, premutation, 
      and full mutation samples, and we performed the screening after confirming the 
      consistency of genotyping results among laboratories. CONCLUSION: Based on our 
      findings, we have determined the intermediate and premutation carrier prevalence 
      of 1/130 and 1/634, respectively, among Chinese women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a 
      neurodegenerative disorder characterized by intention tremor, cerebellar ataxia, 
      and executive dysfunction in carriers of a CGG repeat expansion premutation 
      (55-200 repeats) in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Given reports 
      of poor insight in FXTAS, we postulated that patients with FXTAS would be less 
      likely to exhibit placebo response. OBJECTIVE: To analyze placebo response from 
      the first randomized controlled trial in FXTAS that evaluated cognitive and motor 
      outcomes after 1 year of treatment with memantine. METHODS: Data from the placebo 
      arm of the first randomized controlled trial in FXTAS were analyzed. There were 2 
      coprimary outcomes. Based on studies in Parkinson's disease, placebo responders 
      were defined as individuals with an improvement of at least 50% in the coprimary 
      outcomes. Improvements of 20% and 30% served as secondary cutoff values based on 
      the suggested magnitude of placebo response in other movement disorders. RESULTS: 
      A total of 36 participants in the placebo group completed baseline and follow-up 
      evaluations. The average age was 66 +/- 7 years, and 60% were men. Average CGG 
      repeat size was 86 +/- 18. A total of 19 participants had stage 3 disease. Only 1 
      patient showed 50% improvement in both coprimary outcomes. At 30% and 20% 
      improvement, there were 2 and 3 patients showing placebo response in the 
      coprimary outcomes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with FXTAS exhibited low 
      rates of placebo response in a randomized controlled trial. Further studies on 
      the relationship between baseline insight and placebo responsivity are applicable 
      to FXTAS and other disorders exhibiting cognitive impairment.

AB  - The CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene expand in patients with fragile X syndrome, 
      fragile X-associated tremour/ataxia syndrome and fragile X-associated primary 
      ovarian failure. In this study, the CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene were studied in 
      449 males and 207 females using traditional polymerase chain reaction and triplet 
      repeat primed PCR methods, also 18 CVS samples (six males and 12 females) were 
      tested for prenatal diagnosis. Further, methylation sensitive multiplexed 
      ligation dependent probe amplification was performed on some samples to confirm 
      the results. Regarding the male patients, 1.1% and 9.7% had premutation (PM) and 
      full mutation (FM) alleles, respectively. Also three (0.66%) male patients were 
      mosaic for PM and FM alleles. Among females, 1.9% were GZ carriers and 5.8% were 
      PM carriers. Prenatal diagnosis resulted in detection of two PM and one FM males 
      as well as one FM carrier female. Our results were in concordance with the 
      previously published results.

TI  - A native function for RAN translation and CGG repeats in regulating fragile X 
      protein synthesis.
PG  - 386-397
LID - 10.1038/s41593-020-0590-1 [doi]
AB  - Repeat-associated non-AUG-initiated translation of expanded CGG repeats (CGG RAN) 
      from the FMR1 5'-leader produces toxic proteins that contribute to 
      neurodegeneration in fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. Here we 
      describe how unexpanded CGG repeats and their translation play conserved roles in 
      regulating fragile X protein (FMRP) synthesis. In neurons, CGG RAN acts as an 
      inhibitory upstream open reading frame to suppress basal FMRP production. 
      Activation of mGluR5 receptors enhances FMRP synthesis. This enhancement requires 
      both the CGG repeat and CGG RAN initiation sites. Using non-cleaving antisense 
      oligonucleotides (ASOs), we selectively blocked CGG RAN. This ASO blockade 
      enhanced endogenous FMRP expression in human neurons. In human and rodent 
      neurons, CGG RAN-blocking ASOs suppressed repeat toxicity and prolonged survival. 
      These findings delineate a native function for CGG repeats and RAN translation in 
      regulating basal and activity-dependent FMRP synthesis, and they demonstrate the 
      therapeutic potential of modulating CGG RAN translation in fragile X-associated 
      disorders.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a heritable mental retardation disease caused by 
      unstable trinucleotide repeat sequences in FMR1. FXS is characterized by delayed 
      development, hyperactivity, and autism behavior. Zebrafish is an excellent model 
      to study FXS and the underlying function of fmr1. However, at present, fmr1 
      function is mainly studied via morpholinos or generated mutants using targeting 
      induced local lesions in genomes. However, both of these methods generate 
      off-target effects, making them suboptimal techniques for studying FXS. In this 
      study, CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to generate two zebrafish fmr1 mutant 
      lines. High-throughput behavior analysis, qRT-PCR, and alcian blue staining 
      experiments were employed to investigate fmr1 function. The fmr1 mutant line 
      showed abnormal behavior, learning memory defects, and impaired craniofacial 
      cartilage development. These features are similar to the human FXS phenotype, 
      indicating that the fmr1 mutant generated in this study can be used as a new 
      model for studying the molecular pathology of FXS. It also provides a suitable 
      model for high-throughput screening of small molecule drugs for FXS therapeutics.

TI  - Cascade Testing for Fragile X Syndrome in a Rural Setting in Cameroon 
      (Sub-Saharan Africa).

AB  - Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), an X-linked dominant monogenic condition, is the main 
      genetic cause of intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). 
      FXS is associated with an expansion of CGG repeat sequence in the Fragile X 
      Mental Retardation gene 1 (FMR1) on chromosome X. Following a neuropediatric 
      assessment of two male siblings who presented with signs of FXS that was 
      confirmed with molecular testing, we provided cascade counselling and testing to 
      the extended family. A total of 46 individuals were tested for FXS; among them, 
      58.70% (n = 27) were females. The mean age was 9.4 (+/-5) years for children and 
      45.9 (+/-15.9) years for adults. Pedigree analysis suggested that the founder of 
      these families was likely a normal transmitting male. Four out of 19 males with 
      clinical ID were confirmed to have a full mutation for FXS, while 14/27 females 
      had a pathologic CGG expansion (>56 CGG repeats) on one of their X chromosomes. 
      Two women with premature menopause were confirmed of being carriers of 
      premutation (91 and 101 CGG repeats). We also identified maternal alleles (91 and 
      126 CGG repeats) which expanded to a full mutation in their offspring (>200 CGG 
      repeats). This study is a rare report on FXS from Africa and illustrates the case 
      scenario of implementing genetic medicine for a neurogenetic condition in a rural 
      setting.

TI  - Urine microRNA Pro fi ling Displays miR-125a Dysregulation in Children with Fragile 
      X Syndrome.

LID - 289
AB  - A triplet repeat expansion leading to transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene 
      results in fragile X syndrome (FXS), which is a common cause of inherited 
      intellectual disability and autism. Phenotypic variation requires personalized 
      treatment approaches and hampers clinical trials in FXS. We searched for microRNA 
      (miRNA) biomarkers for FXS using deep sequencing of urine and identi fi ed 28 
      differentially regulated miRNAs when 219 reliably identi fi ed miRNAs were compared 
      in dizygotic twin boys who shared the same environment, but one had an FXS full 
      mutation, and the other carried a premutation allele. The largest increase was 
      found in miR-125a in the FXS sample, and the miR-125a levels were increased in 
      two independent sets of urine samples from a total of 19 FXS children. Urine 
      miR-125a levels appeared to increase with age in control subjects, but varied 
      widely in FXS subjects. Should the results be generalized, it could suggest that 
      two FXS subgroups existed. Predicted gene targets of the differentially regulated 
      miRNAs are involved in molecular pathways that regulate developmental processes, 
      homeostasis, and neuronal function. Regulation of miR-125a has been associated 
      with type I metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling (mGluR), which has been 
      explored as a treatment target for FXS, reinforcing the possibility that urine 
      miR-125a may provide a novel biomarker for FXS.

TI  - Repeat expansion and methylation-sensitive triplet-primed polymerase chain 
      reaction for fragile X mental retardation 1 gene screening in institutionalised 
      intellectually disabled individuals.
PG  - 143-148
LID - 10.11622/smedj.2020009 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most prevalent X-linked 
      intellectual disability (ID) and a leading genetic cause of autism, characterised 
      by cognitive and behavioural impairments. The hyperexpansion of a CGG repeat in 
      the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene leads to abnormal 
      hypermethylation, resulting in the lack or absence of its protein. Tools for 
      establishing the diagnosis of FXS have been extensively developed, including 
      assays based on triplet-primed polymerase chain reaction (TP-PCR) for detection 
      and quantification of the CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion, as well as 
      determination of the methylation status of the alleles. This study aimed to 
      utilise a simple, quick and affordable method for high sensitivity and 
      specificity screening and diagnosis of FXS in institutionalised individuals with 
      ID. METHODS: A total of 109 institutionalised individuals at the Center for 
      Social Rehabilitation of Intellectual Disability Kartini, Temanggung, Central 
      Java, Indonesia, were screened in a three-step process using FastFrax 
      Identification, Sizing and Methylation Status Kits. RESULTS: Two samples that 
      were classified as indeterminate with respect to the 41-repeat control at the 
      identification step were subsequently determined to be non-expanded by both 
      sizing and methylation status analyses. Two samples classified as expanded at the 
      identification step were determined to carry full mutation expansions > 200 
      repeats that were fully methylated using sizing and methylation status analyses, 
      respectively, yielding a disease prevalence of 1.83%. CONCLUSION: Repeat 
      expansion and methylation-specific TP-PCR is practical, effective and inexpensive 
      for the diagnosis of FXS, especially in high-risk populations of individuals with 
      ID of undetermined aetiology.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome, the leading heritable form of intellectual disability, is 
      caused by hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of large (CGG) repeat 
      expansions (> 200 repeats) in the 5' untranslated region of the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. As a consequence of FMR1 gene silencing, there is 
      little or no production of FMR1 protein (FMRP), an important element in normal 
      synaptic function. Although the absence of FMRP has long been known to be 
      responsible for the cognitive impairment in fragile X syndrome, the relationship 
      between FMRP level and cognitive ability (IQ) is only imprecisely understood. To 
      address this issue, a high-throughput, fluorescence resonance energy transfer 
      (FRET) assay has been used to quantify FMRP levels in dermal fibroblasts, and the 
      relationship between FMRP and IQ measures was assessed by statistical analysis in 
      a cohort of 184 individuals with CGG-repeat lengths spanning normal (< 45 CGGs) 
      to full mutation (> 200 CGGs) repeat ranges in fibroblasts. The principal 
      findings of the current study are twofold: i) For those with normal CGG repeats, 
      IQ is no longer sensitive to further increases in FMRP above an FMRP threshold of 
      ~70% of the mean FMRP level; below this threshold, IQ decreases steeply with 
      further decreases in FMRP; and ii) For the current cohort, a mean IQ of 85 (lower 
      bound for the normal IQ range) is attained for FMRP levels that are only ~35% of 
      the mean FMRP level among normal CGG-repeat controls. The current results should 
      help guide expectations for efforts to induce FMR1 gene activity and for the 
      levels of cognitive function expected for a given range of FMRP levels.

AB  - Individuals who carry a premutation (PM) allele on the FMR1 gene may experience 
      executive limitations associated with their genetic status, including inhibition 
      deficits. However, poor understanding of individualized risk factors has limited 
      clinical management of this group, particularly in mothers who carry the PM 
      allele who have children with fragile X syndrome (FXS). The present study 
      examined CGG repeat length and age as factors that may account for variable 
      expressivity of inhibition deficits. Participants were 134 carriers of the PM 
      allele who were mothers of children with FXS. Inhibition skills were measured 
      using both self-report and direct behavioral assessments. Increased vulnerability 
      for inhibition deficits was observed at mid-range CGG lengths of approximately 
      80-100 repeats, with some evidence of a second zone of vulnerability occurring at 
      approximately 130-140 CGG repeats. Risk associated with the genotype also became 
      more pronounced with older age. This study identifies personalized risk factors 
      that may be used to tailor the clinical management of executive deficits in 
      carriers of the PM allele. Inhibition deficits may contribute to poor outcomes in 
      carriers of the PM allele and their families, particularly in midlife and early 
      old age, and clinical monitoring may be warranted.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common genetic form of intellectual 
      disability caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the 5'-UTR of the Fragile X mental 
      retardation gene FMR1, triggering epigenetic silencing and the subsequent absence 
      of the protein, FMRP. Reactivation of FMR1 represents an attractive therapeutic 
      strategy targeting the genetic root cause of FXS. However, largely missing in the 
      FXS field is an understanding of how much FMR1 reactivation is required to rescue 
      FMRP-dependent mutant phenotypes. Here, we utilize FXS patient-derived excitatory 
      neurons to model FXS in vitro and confirm that the absence of FMRP leads to 
      neuronal hyperactivity. We further determined the levels of FMRP and the 
      percentage of FMRP-positive cells necessary to correct this phenotype utilizing a 
      mixed and mosaic neuronal culture system and a combination of CRISPR, antisense 
      and expression technologies to titrate FMRP in FXS and WT neurons. Our data 
      demonstrate that restoration of greater than 5% of overall FMRP expression levels 
      or greater than 20% FMRP-expressing neurons in a mosaic pattern is sufficient to 
      normalize a FMRP-dependent, hyperactive phenotype in FXS iPSC-derived neurons.

AB  - Newborn screening is designed for presymptomatic identification of serious 
      conditions with effective early interventions. Clinical laboratories must perform 
      prospective pilot studies to ensure that the analytical performance and workflow 
      for a given screening test are appropriate. We assessed the potential to screen 
      newborns for fragile X syndrome, a monogenic neurodevelopmental disorder, by 
      establishing a customized, high-throughput PCR and analysis software system 
      designed to detect fragile X mental retardation 1 gene repeat expansions from 
      dried blood spots (DBSs). Assay precision, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity 
      were characterized across the categorical range of repeat expansions. The assay 
      consistently resolved genotypes within three CGG repeats of reference values up 
      to at least 137 repeats and within six repeats for larger expansions up to 200 
      repeats. Accuracy testing results were concordant with reference results. Full 
      and premutation alleles were detected from subnanogram DNA inputs eluted from 
      DBSs and from mixtures with down to 1% relative abundance of the respective 
      expansion. Analysis of 963 deidentified newborn DBS samples identified 957 normal 
      and 6 premutation specimens, consistent with previously published prevalence 
      estimates. These studies demonstrate that the assay system can support 
      high-throughput newborn screening programs.

TI  - Methylated premutation of the FMR1 gene in three sisters: correlating CGG 
      expansion and epigenetic inactivation.
PG  - 567-575
LID - 10.1038/s41431-019-0554-7 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a very frequent cause of inherited intellectual 
      disability (ID) and autism. Most FXS patients have an expansion over 200 repeats 
      of (CGG)(n) sequence ("full mutation" (FM)) located in the 5'UTR of the FMR1 
      gene, resulting in local DNA methylation (methylated "full mutation" (MFM)) and 
      epigenetic silencing. The absence of the FMRP protein is responsible for the 
      clinical phenotype of FXS. FM arises from a smaller maternal allele with 56-200 
      CGG repeats ("premutation" (PM)) during maternal meiosis. Carriers of PM alleles, 
      which are typically unmethylated, can manifest other clinical features (primary 
      ovarian insufficiency (POI) or FXS-associated tremor-ataxia syndrome (FXTAS)), 
      known as fragile X-related disorders. In FXS families, rare males who have 
      inherited an unmethylated "full mutation" (UFM) have been described. These 
      individuals produce enough FMRP to allow normal intellectual functioning. Here we 
      report the rare case of three sisters with a completely methylated PM of around 
      140 CGGs and detail their neuropsychological function. X inactivation analysis 
      confirmed that the three sisters have a random inactivation of the X chromosome, 
      suggesting that the PM allele is always methylated also when residing on the 
      active X. We propose that in exceptional cases, just as the FM may be 
      unmethylated, also a PM allele may be fully methylated. To our knowledge, females 
      with a methylated PM allele and a mild impairment have reported only once. The 
      study of these atypical individuals demonstrates that the size of the CGG 
      expansion is not as tightly coupled to methylation as previously thought.

AB  - Ventricular enlargement (VE) is commonly observed in aging and fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late-onset neurodegenerative 
      disorder. VE may generate a mechanical force causing structural deformation. In 
      this longitudinal study, we examined the relationships between VE and structural 
      changes in the corpus callosum (CC) and putamen. MRI scans (2-7/person over 
      0.2-7.5 years) were acquired from 22 healthy controls, 26 unaffected premutation 
      carriers (PFX-), and 39 carriers affected with FXTAS (PFX+). Compared with 
      controls, PFX- demonstrated enlarged fourth ventricles, whereas PFX+ displayed 
      enlargement in both third and fourth ventricles, CC thinning, putamen 
      atrophy/deformation (thinning and increased distance), and accelerated expansions 
      in lateral ventricles. Common for all groups, baseline VE predicted accelerated 
      CC thinning and putamen atrophy/deformation and conversely, baseline CC and 
      putamen atrophy/deformation and enlarged third and fourth ventricles predicted 
      accelerated lateral ventricular expansion. The results suggest a progressive VE 
      within the 4 ventricles as FXTAS develops and a deleterious cycle between VE and 
      brain deformation that may commonly occur during aging and FXTAS progression but 
      become accelerated in FXTAS.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a rare disorder associated 
      to the presence of the fragile X premutation, a 55-200 CGG repeat expansion in 
      the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene. Two main neurological phenotypes have been described 
      in carriers of the CGG premutation: (1) neurodevelopmental disorders 
      characterized by anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), social 
      deficits, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD); and (2) after 50 years old, the 
      FXTAS phenotype. This neurodegenerative disorder is characterized by ataxia and a 
      form of parkinsonism. The molecular pathology of this disorder is characterized 
      by the presence of elevated levels of Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) mRNA, 
      presence of a repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translated peptide, and FMR1 
      mRNA-containing nuclear inclusions. Whereas in the past FXTAS was mainly 
      considered as a late-onset disorder, some phenotypes of patients and altered 
      learning and memory behavior of a mouse model of FXTAS suggested that this 
      disorder involves neurodevelopment. To better understand the physiopathological 
      role of the increased levels of Fmr1 mRNA during neuronal differentiation, we 
      used a small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach to reduce the abundance of this 
      mRNA in cultured cortical neurons from the FXTAS mouse model. Morphological 
      alterations of neurons were rescued by this approach. This cellular phenotype is 
      associated to differentially expressed proteins that we identified by mass 
      spectrometry analysis. Interestingly, phenotype rescue is also associated to the 
      rescue of the abundance of 29 proteins that are involved in various pathways, 
      which represent putative targets for early therapeutic approaches.

AB  - CGG repeat expansions in FMR1 cause the neurodegenerative disorder Fragile 
      X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS). Ubiquitinated neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusions (NIIs) are the neuropathological hallmark of FXTAS. Both sense strand 
      derived CGG repeats and antisense strand derived CCG repeats support non-AUG 
      initiated (RAN) translation of homopolymeric proteins in potentially 6 different 
      reading frames. However, the relative abundance of these proteins in FXTAS brains 
      and their co-localization with each other and NIIs is lacking. Here we describe 
      rater-blinded assessment of immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining 
      with newly generated antibodies to different CGG RAN translation products in 
      FXTAS and control brains as well as co-staining with ubiquitin, p62/SQSTM1, and 
      ubiquilin 2. We find that both FMRpolyG and a second CGG repeat derived RAN 
      translation product, FMRpolyA, accumulate in aggregates in FXTAS brains. FMRpolyG 
      is a near-obligate component of both ubiquitin-positive and p62-positive NIIs in 
      FXTAS, with occurrence of aggregates in 20% of all hippocampal neurons and > 90% 
      of all inclusions. A subset of these inclusions also stain positive for the 
      ALS/FTD associated protein ubiquilin 2. Ubiquitinated inclusions and FMRpolyG+ 
      aggregates are rarer in cortex and cerebellum. Intriguingly, FMRpolyG staining is 
      also visible in control neuronal nuclei. In contrast to FMRpolyG, staining for 
      FMRpolyA and CCG antisense derived RAN translation products were less abundant 
      and less frequent components of ubiquitinated inclusions. In conclusion, RAN 
      translated FMRpolyG is a common component of ubiquitin and p62 positive 
      inclusions in FXTAS patient brains.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with premutation alleles of the FMR1 gene are at risk of 
      developing fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a 
      neurodegenerative condition affecting sensorimotor function. Information on 
      quantitative symptom traits associated with aging in premutation carriers is 
      needed to clarify neurodegenerative processes contributing to FXTAS. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: 26 FMR1 premutation carriers ages 44-77 years and 31 age-matched 
      healthy controls completed rapid (2 s) and sustained (8 s) visually guided 
      precision gripping tasks. Individuals pressed at multiple force levels to 
      determine the impact of increasing the difficulty of sensorimotor actions on 
      precision behavior. During initial pressing, reaction time, the rate at which 
      individuals increased their force, the duration of pressing, and force accuracy 
      were measured. During sustained gripping, the complexity of the force time 
      series, force variability, and mean force were examined. During relaxation, the 
      rate at which individuals decreased their force was measured. We also examined 
      the relationships between visuomotor behavior and cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) 
      repeat length and clinically rated FXTAS symptoms. RESULTS: Relative to controls, 
      premutation carriers showed reduced rates of initial force generation during 
      rapid motor actions and longer durations of their initial pressing with their 
      dominant hand. During sustained force, premutation carriers demonstrated reduced 
      force complexity, though this effect was specific to younger premutation carries 
      during dominant hand pressing and was more severe for younger relative to older 
      premutation carriers at low and medium force levels. Increased reaction time and 
      lower sustained force complexity each were associated with greater CGG repeat 
      length for premutation carriers. Increased reaction time and increased sustained 
      force variability were associated with more severe clinically rated FXTAS 
      symptoms. CONCLUSION: Overall our findings suggest multiple sensorimotor 
      processes are disrupted in aging premutation carriers, including initial force 
      control guided by feedforward mechanisms and sustained sensorimotor behaviors 
      guided by sensory feedback control processes. Results indicating that 
      sensorimotor issues in aging premutation carriers relate to both greater CGG 
      repeat length and clinically rated FXTAS symptoms suggest that quantitative tests 
      of precision sensorimotor ability may serve as key targets for monitoring FXTAS 
      risk and progression.

AB  - Expansions of simple trinucleotide repeats, such as (CGG)(n), (CAG)(n) or 
      (GAA)(n), are responsible for more than 40 hereditary disorders in humans 
      including fragile X syndrome, Huntington's disease, myotonic dystrophy, and 
      Friedreich's ataxia. While the mechanisms of repeat expansions were intensively 
      studied for over two decades, the final picture has yet to emerge. It was 
      important, therefore, to develop a mammalian experimental system for studying 
      repeat instability, which would recapitulate repeat instability observed in human 
      pedigrees. Here, we describe a genetically tractable experimental system to study 
      the instability of (CGG)(n) repeats in cultured mammalian cells (Kononenko et 
      al., Nat Struct Mol Biol 25:669-676, 2018). It is based on a selectable cassette 
      carrying the HyTK gene under the control of the FMR1 promoter with carrier-size 
      (CGG)(n) repeats in its 5' UTR, which was integrated into the unique RL5 site in 
      murine erythroid leukemia cells. Expansions of these repeats and/or 
      repeat-induced mutagenesis shut down the reporter, which results in the 
      accumulation of ganciclovir-resistance cells. This system is useful for 
      understanding the genetic controls of repeat instability in mammalian cells. In 
      the long run, it can be adjusted to screen for drugs that either alleviate repeat 
      expansions or reactivate the FMR1 promoter.

TI  - A Robust Polymerase Chain Reaction-based Assay for Quantifying 
      Cytosine-guanine-guanine Trinucleotide Repeats in Fragile X Mental Retardation-1 
      Gene.
LID - 10.3791/59963 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and associated disorders are caused by expansion of the 
      cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) trinucleotide repeat in the 5' untranslated region 
      (UTR) of the Fragile X mental retardation-1 (FMR1) gene promoter. Conventionally, 
      capillary electrophoresis fragment analysis on a genetic analyzer is used for the 
      sizing of the CGG repeats of FMR1, but additional Southern blot analysis is 
      required for exact measurement when the repeat number is higher than 200. Here, 
      we present an accurate and robust polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method 
      for quantification of the CGG repeats of FMR1. The first step of this test is PCR 
      amplification of the repeat sequences in the 5'UTR of the FMR1 promoter using a 
      Fragile X PCR kit, followed by purification of the PCR products and fragment 
      sizing on a microfluidic capillary electrophoresis instrument, and subsequent 
      interpretation of the number of CGG repeats by referencing standards with known 
      repeats using the analysis software. This PCR-based assay is reproducible and 
      capable of identifying the full range of CGG repeats of FMR1 promoters, including 
      those with a repeat number of more than 200 (classified as full mutation), 55 to 
      200 (premutation), 46 to 54 (intermediate), and 10 to 45 (normal). It is a 
      cost-effective method that facilitates classification of the FXS and Fragile 
      X-associated disorders with robustness and rapid reporting time.

AB  - We examined the benefit of emotional support on daily health in premutation 
      carrier mothers of adolescents and adults with fragile X syndrome (n = 114), and 
      whether this benefit was moderated by the mother's genetic status (FMR1 CGG 
      repeat length). In an 8-day daily diary, maternal daily health was assessed 
      subjectively through self-reported number of physical health symptoms and 
      physiologically via cortisol awakening response. Multilevel lagged-day models 
      indicated that premutation carrier mothers with midrange CGG repeats derived less 
      health benefit from a day with high positive emotional support than those with 
      lower or higher numbers of repeats within the premutation range. The data support 
      the influence of both genetic and environmental influences on the health of this 
      population.

      Syndrome.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative 
      disorder associated with a premutation repeat expansion (55-200 CGG repeats) in 
      the 5' noncoding region of the FMR1 gene. Solitary intranuclear inclusions within 
      FXTAS neurons and astrocytes constitute a hallmark of the disorder, yet our 
      understanding of how and why these bodies form is limited. Here, we have 
      discovered that FXTAS inclusions emit a distinct autofluorescence spectrum, which 
      forms the basis of a novel, unbiased method for isolating FXTAS inclusions by 
      preparative fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Using a combination of 
      autofluorescence-based FACS and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry 
      (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomics, we have identified more than two hundred proteins 
      that are enriched within the inclusions relative to FXTAS whole nuclei. Whereas 
      no single protein species dominates inclusion composition, highly enriched levels 
      of conjugated small ubiquitin-related modifier 2 (SUMO 2) protein and 
      p62/sequestosome-1 (p62/SQSTM1) protein were found within the inclusions. Many 
      additional proteins involved with RNA binding, protein turnover, and DNA damage 
      repair were enriched within inclusions relative to total nuclear protein. The 
      current analysis has also allowed the first direct detection, through peptide 
      sequencing, of endogenous FMRpolyG peptide, the product of repeat-associated 
      non-ATG (RAN) translation of the FMR1 mRNA. However, this peptide was found only 
      at extremely low levels and not within whole FXTAS nuclear preparations, raising 
      the question whether endogenous RAN products exist at quantities sufficient to 
      contribute to FXTAS pathogenesis. The abundance of the inclusion-associated 
      ubiquitin- and SUMO-based modifiers supports a model for inclusion formation as 
      the result of increased protein loads and elevated oxidative stress leading to 
      maladaptive autophagy. These results highlight the need to further investigate 
      FXTAS pathogenesis in the context of endogenous systems.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked dominant disorder and the most common cause of 
      inherited mental retardation. It is caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion in 
      the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) at the Xq27.3. The expansion 
      blocks expression of the gene product, Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein 
      (FMRP). The syndrome includes mild to moderate mental retardation and behavioral 
      manifestations such as tactile defensiveness, gaze avoidance, repetitive motor 
      mannerisms, perseverative (repetitive) speech, hyperarousal and it frequently 
      includes seizures. This behavioral phenotype overlaps significantly with autism 
      spectrum disorder. The knockout mice lack normal Fmr1 protein and show 
      macro-orchidism, learning deficits, and hyperactivity. Consequently, this 
      knockout mouse may serve as a valuable tool in the elucidation of the 
      physiological role of FMR1 and the mechanisms involved in macroorchidism, 
      abnormal behavior, abnormalities comparable to those of human fragile X patients. 
      In this study we evaluated the effects of taurine on the testicular physiology to 
      better understand the cellular mechanisms underlying macro-orchidism. We found 
      that there was a significant decrease in the number of Leydig cells in the testis 
      of fragile X mouse. Furthermore, the expression of somatostatin was drastically 
      decreased and differential expression pattern of CDK5 in fragile X mouse testis. 
      In the control testis, CDK is expressed in primary and secondary spermatids 
      whereas in the Fmr1 ko mice CDK 5 is expressed mainly in spermatogonia. Taurine 
      supplementation led to an increase in CDK5 expression in both controls and Ko 
      mice. CDKs (Cyclin-dependent kinases) are a group of serine/threonine protein 
      kinases activated by binding to a regulatory subunit cyclin. Over 20 functionally 
      diverse proteins involved in cytoskeleton dynamics, cell adhesion, transport, and 
      membrane trafficking act as CDK5 substrates elucidating the molecular mechanisms 
      of CDK5 function. CDK5 phosphorylates a diverse list of substrates, implicating 
      it in the regulation of a range of cellular processes. CDK5 is expressed in 
      Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, spermatogonia and peritubular cells indicating a 
      role in spermatogenesis. In this study we examined the expression levels of CDK5 
      and how it is affected by taurine supplementation in the testes and found that 
      taurine plays an important role in testicular physiology and corrected some of 
      the pathophysiology observed in the fragile x mouse testis.

TI  - Association between the FMR1 CGG repeat lengths and the severity of idiopathic 
      primary ovarian insufficiency: a meta analysis.
PG  - 3116-3122
LID - 10.1080/21691401.2019.1645153 [doi]
AB  - Aim: Reports on the association of the CGG repeat length in the FMR1 gene with 
      the severity of idiopathic POI are inconclusive. Therefore, a meta analysis was 
      performed to investigate the relationship between the expansion of repeat CGG and 
      idiopathic POI risk. Methods: Up to January 2019, 18 case-control or cohort 
      studies involving 3394 idiopathic POI patients and 8461 controls were included 
      for meta analysis. Results: Thirteen studies, including 2047 cases and 6912 
      controls, met our criteria for the assessment of the premutation and intermediate 
      repeat length in patients with overt POI. Compared with controls, FMR1 gene 
      premutation is significantly associated with overt POI (OR = 8.13; 95% CI: 
      4.35-15.19; p < .00001), whereas there was no significant correlation between 
      intermediate repeat length and overt POI (OR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.62-1.18; p = .34). 
      Seven studies, representing 1347 patients and 1948 controls, were eligible for 
      evaluation of the premutation and intermediate repeat length in occult POI. The 
      association between premutation and occult POI was significant (p < .00001), with 
      a pooled fixed effects OR of 11.32 (4.45-28.80), and no significant correlation 
      of intermediate size to occult POI was found in the case-control comparison (OR = 
      1.00; 95% CI: 0.68-1.47; p = .98). Conclusion: There is a close association 
      between premutation of the FMR1 gene and increased susceptibility to idiopathic 
      POI of each stage and no correlation between intermediate repeat length of the 
      FMR1 gene and the severity of idiopathic POI.

AB  - A CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of FMR1 causes the 
      neurodegenerative disorder Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). 
      This repeat supports a non-canonical mode of protein synthesis known as 
      repeat-associated, non-AUG (RAN) translation. The mechanism underlying RAN 
      translation at CGG repeats remains unclear. To identify modifiers of RAN 
      translation and potential therapeutic targets, we performed a candidate-based 
      screen of eukaryotic initiation factors and RNA helicases in cell-based assays 
      and a Drosophila melanogaster model of FXTAS. We identified multiple modifiers of 
      toxicity and RAN translation from an expanded CGG repeat in the context of the 
      FMR1 5'UTR. These include the DEAD-box RNA helicase belle/DDX3X, the helicase 
      accessory factors EIF4B/4H, and the start codon selectivity factors EIF1 and 
      EIF5. Disrupting belle/DDX3X selectively inhibited FMR1 RAN translation in 
      Drosophila in vivo and cultured human cells, and mitigated repeat-induced 
      toxicity in Drosophila and primary rodent neurons. These findings implicate RNA 
      secondary structure and start codon fidelity as critical elements mediating FMR1 
      RAN translation and identify potential targets for treating repeat-associated 
      neurodegeneration.

AB  - The gut microbiota is important for maintaining homeostasis of the host. Gut 
      microbes represent the initial site for toxicant processing following dietary 
      exposures to environmental contaminants. The diet is the primary route of 
      exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which are absorbed via the gut, and 
      subsequently interfere with neurodevelopment and behavior. Developmental 
      exposures to PCBs have been linked to increased risk of neurodevelopmental 
      disorders (NDD), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which are also 
      associated with a high prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) distress and 
      intestinal dysbiosis. We hypothesized that developmental PCB exposure impacts 
      colonization of the gut microbiota, resulting in GI pathophysiology, in a 
      genetically susceptible host. Mouse dams expressing two heritable human mutations 
      (double mutants [DM]) that result in abnormal Ca(2+) dynamics and produce 
      behavioral deficits (gain of function mutation in the ryanodine receptor 1 
      [T4826I-RYR1] and a human CGG repeat expansion [170-200 CGG repeats] in the 
      fragile X mental retardation gene 1 [FMR1 premutation]). DM and congenic wild 
      type (WT) controls were exposed to PCBs (0-6...mg/kg/d) in the diet starting 2 
      weeks before gestation and continuing through postnatal day 21 (P21). Intestinal 
      physiology (Ussing chambers), inflammation (qPCR) and gut microbiome (16S 
      sequencing) studies were performed in offspring mice (P28-P30). Developmental 
      exposure to PCBs in the maternal diet caused significant mucosal barrier defects 
      in ileum and colon (increased secretory state and tight junction permeability) of 
      juvenile DM mice. Furthermore, PCB exposure increased the intestinal inflammatory 
      profile (Il6, Il1beta, and Il22), and resulted in dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, 
      including altered beta-diversity, in juvenile DM mice developmentally exposed to 
      1...mg/kg/d PCBs when compared to WT controls. Collectively, these findings 
      demonstrate a novel interaction between PCB exposure and the gut microbiota in a 
      genetically susceptible host that provide novel insight into environmental risk 
      factors for neurodevelopmental disorders.

      neuroimaging findings between neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) and 
      fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome caused by noncoding CGG repeat expansions in 
      FMR1, we directly searched for repeat expansion mutations and identified 
      noncoding CGG repeat expansions in NBPF19 (NOTCH2NLC) as the causative mutations 
      for NIID. Further prompted by the similarities in the clinical and neuroimaging 
      findings with NIID, we identified similar noncoding CGG repeat expansions in two 
      other diseases: oculopharyngeal myopathy with leukoencephalopathy and 
      oculopharyngodistal myopathy, in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 and LRP12, respectively. 
      These findings expand our knowledge of the clinical spectra of diseases caused by 
      expansions of the same repeat motif, and further highlight how directly searching 
      for expanded repeats can help identify mutations underlying diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) is a 
      neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by tremor, ataxic gait, and 
      balance issues resulting from a premutation of the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 
      (FMR1) gene. No biomarkers have yet been identified to allow early diagnosis of 
      FXTAS, however, recent studies have reported subtle issues in the stability of 
      younger premutation carriers, before disease onset. This study investigates the 
      efficacy of multiscale entropy analysis (MSE) in detecting early changes in the 
      motor system of premutation carriers without FXTAS. METHODS: Sway complexity of 
      12 female Premutation carriers and 15 healthy Controls were measured under four 
      conditions: eyes open, closed, and two dual-task conditions. A Sustained 
      Attention Response Task (SART) and a working memory based N-Back task were 
      employed to increase cognitive load while standing on the forceplate. A 
      Complexity Index (Ci) was calculated for anterior-posterior (AP) and mediolateral 
      (ML) sway. Independent t-tests were used to assess between-group differences and 
      Oneway repeated measures ANOVA were used to assess within group differences with 
      Bonferroni corrections to adjust for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Group 
      performances were comparable with eyes open and closed conditions. The Carrier 
      group's Ci was consistent across tasks and conditions while the Control group's 
      AP Ci increased significantly during the cognitive dual-task (p = 0.001). There 
      was also a strong correlation between CGG repeat length and complexity for the 
      Carrier group (p = 0.004). SIGNIFICANCE: Increased sway complexity is believed to 
      stem from reallocation of attention to facilitate the increased cognitive demands 
      of dual-tasks. Carriers' complexity did not change during dual-tasks, possibly 
      indicating capacity interference and inefficient division of attention. Lower 
      sway complexity in carriers suggests diminished adaptive capacity under stress as 
      well as degradation of motor functioning. Therefore, sway complexity may be a 
      useful tool in identifying early functional decline in FMR1 premutation carriers 
      as well as monitoring progression towards disease onset.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome is a late-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder that affects about 40% of carriers of CGG-repeat 
      expansions in the premutation range within the fragile X gene (FMR1). Main 
      clinical features include intention tremor, cerebellar ataxia, and parkinsonism. 
      Recently, great emphasis on the deposition of soluble aggregates produced by a 
      RAN translation process, as main pathogenic mechanism, has been given. These 
      aggregates contain a small protein with a polyglycine stretch on the 
      aminoterminal end named FMRpolyG and, so far, have been isolated and 
      characterized in drosophila and mouse models, in post mortem brain of fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome patients, in fibroblasts of fragile primary 
      ovarian insufficiency patients, but never in fibroblasts from a fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia living patients. In adult carriers the syndrome is 
      frequently misdiagnosed due to the lack of specific markers. METHODS: We 
      standardized immunocytochemistry, immunoprecipitation and western blot procedures 
      to study and biochemically characterize the FMRpolyG protein in fibroblasts from 
      human skin biopsy. RESULTS: We demonstrate for the first time, in fibroblasts 
      from a patient affected by Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, the 
      presence ex vivo of inclusions consisting of FMRpolyG- Hsp70 soluble aggregates. 
      CONCLUSION: These observations can pave the way to develop a cellular model for 
      studying ex vivo and in vitro the mechanisms involved in the production of 
      FMRpolyG aggregates, their toxicity, and the role of the FMRpolyG-Hsp70 
      interaction in the pathogenesis of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome.

      tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). The transcripts of these expanded repeats 
      r(CGG)(exp) either form RNA foci or undergo the repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) 
      translation that produces toxic homopolymeric proteins in neuronal cells. The 
      discovery of small molecule modulators that possess a strong binding affinity and 
      high selectivity to these toxic expanded repeats RNA could be a promising 
      therapeutic approach to cure the expanded repeat-associated neurological 
      diseases. Therefore, here we sought to test the therapeutic potential of a 
      natural alkaloid, piperine, by assessing its ability to bind and neutralize the 
      toxicity of r(CGG)(exp) RNA motif. To accomplish this first, we have determined 
      the affinity of piperine to r(CGG)(exp) RNA using fluorescence-based binding 
      assay and isothermal titration calorimetry assay. These assays showed that 
      piperine forms a thermodynamically favorable interaction with r(CGG)(exp) RNA 
      with high selectivity to the G-rich RNA motif. Interaction of piperine with 
      r(CGG)(exp) motif was further validated using several biophysical techniques such 
      as CD, CD melting, NMR spectroscopy, and gel retardation assay. Moreover, 
      piperine was also found to be effective for improving the r(CGG)(exp) associated 
      splicing defects and RAN translation in a FXTAS cell model system. Our results 
      effectively provided the evidence that piperine strongly interacts with 
      r(CGG)(exp) RNA and could be used as a suitable candidate for therapeutic 
      development against FXTAS.

LID - 10.1080/14737159.2019.1622416 [doi]
AB  - Background: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of inherited 
      intellectual disability (ID), is caused by a CGG repeat expansion (full mutation 
      (FM), >200 CGG) at the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Early 
      identification of FXS has prognostic significance for affected individuals due to 
      early initiation of interventions. Genetic counseling and family screening can 
      aid parents and at-risk asymptomatic carriers (premutation (PM), 55-200 CGG) in 
      taking proper reproductive decisions. Methodology: The present study utilizes 
      Triplet Primed-Polymerase Chain Reaction (TP-PCR) methodology for detecting the 
      repeat expansion at FMR1 gene in 233 Indian intellectual disability/developmental 
      delay (ID/DD) patients. Results: We have identified 18/233 (7.7%) FXS positive 
      cases. Early diagnosis was made in 66.7% cases (<10 years). Extended family 
      screening in 14 affected individuals identified 9 additional FM cases (7 males 
      and 2 females) and 23 carrier PM females, which otherwise could have been missed. 
      Four prenatal diagnoses were also performed, leading to the identification of 1 
      PM and 1 FM carrier fetus. Conclusion: A high frequency (7.7%) of FXS among 
      Indian ID/DD subjects obtained in this study depicted the need for more 
      professional recommendations concerning prompt referral for genetic testing, and 
      increased exposure to information about FXS to pediatricians.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of CGG repeat expansion mutation in FMR1 gene varies 
      among different populations. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of 
      this mutation in women of reproductive age from northern China. METHODS: A total 
      of 11,891 pre-conceptional or pregnant women, including 5037 pregnant women and 
      7357 women with the history of spontaneous abortion or induced abortion due to 
      delayed growth of the embryos, were recruited. The number of CGG repeats in FMR1 
      was measured by the TRP-PCR method. We also offered genetic counseling and 
      prenatal diagnosis to the women carrying pre-mutation or full mutation alleles. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of pre-mutation in reproductive women in northern China 
      was 1/410, higher than that in southern China and Korea but lower than that in 
      western countries. We also found that the prevalence of pre-mutation was 
      relatively high (1/320) in women with abortion history. CONCLUSION: Screening for 
      CGG repeat expansion mutation in FMR1 should be recommended to the women with the 
      history of spontaneous abortion or induced abortion due to delayed growth of the 
      embryos.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Premature ovarian insufficiency is a lack of ovarian functions in 
      patients younger than 40 years old. Genetic causes leading to accelerated 
      follicle depletion may result in premature ovarian insufficiency. We aimed to 
      determine genetic etiology of nonsyndromic premature ovarian insufficiency cases 
      from Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 86 nonsyndromic premature ovarian 
      insufficiency cases and 26 matched control female participants. Participants have 
      been investigated in cytogenetic analysis followed by FMR1 repeat size expansions 
      and search of variants for nine premature ovarian insufficiency-associated genes. 
      RESULTS: Four cases had a structural cytogenetic abnormality. Two cases revealed 
      with premutation size FMR1 triplet repeat expansion. Four cases carried variants 
      in which two were very rare in FSHR and PDPK1, and three were novel in NR5A1, 
      PDPK1, and POF1B genes. Six novel variants have been identified in NOBOX, NR5A1, 
      POF1B, and PDPK1 in control population assigned to be benign alterations. 
      CONCLUSION: Mosaicism of sex chromosomes was responsible in 4.6% and FMR1 
      premutation in 2.4% of premature ovarian insufficiency cases, while the 
      association of premature ovarian insufficiency-related genes was found very 
      subtle. Novel variants in NR5A1, PDPK1, and POF1B may necessitate further 
      evaluation for their association with premature ovarian insufficiency via 
      functional studies.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CGG-repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene on the 
      X-chromosome. Both elevated levels of the expanded FMR1 mRNA and aberrant 
      expression of a polyglycine protein (FMRpolyG) from the CGG-repeat region are 
      hypothesized to trigger the pathogenesis of FXTAS. While increased expression of 
      FMRpolyG leads to higher toxicity in FXTAS models, the pathogenic effect of this 
      protein has only been studied in the presence of CGG-containing mRNA. Here we 
      present a model that allows measurement of the effect of FMRpolyG-expression 
      without co-expression of the corresponding CGG mRNA hairpin. This allows direct 
      comparison of the effect of the FMRpolyG protein per se, vs. that of the FMRpolyG 
      protein together with the CGG mRNA hairpin. Our results show that expression of 
      the FMRpolyG, in the absence of any CGG mRNA, is sufficient to cause reduced cell 
      viability, lamin ring disruption and aggregate formation. Furthermore, we found 
      FMRpolyG to be a long-lived protein degraded primarily by the 
      ubiquitin-proteasome-system. Together, our data indicate that accumulation of 
      FMRpolyG protein per se may play a major role in the development of FXTAS.

AB  - The vast majority of fragile X affected patients do not transcribe FMR1 due to a 
      CGG repeat expansion in the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. When the 
      CGGs considerably expand, it elicits abnormal DNA methylation and histone 
      modifications, which are responsible for FMR1 transcriptional silencing. In this 
      chapter, we describe in detail two commonly used protocols for monitoring the 
      epigenetic state of the FMR1 gene that bypass the difficulty in directly 
      analyzing the CGGs. One protocol is for accurately measuring DNA methylation 
      levels and the other is for profiling histone modifications.

LID - 10.1007/978-1-4939-9213-3_14 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) CGG repeat expansions cause fragile X 
      syndrome-the leading monogenic form of intellectual disability-and increase the 
      risk for fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome and fragile X-associated 
      primary ovarian insufficiency. Southern blot (SB) analysis is the current gold 
      standard test for FMR1 molecular diagnosis. Several polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR)-based methods are now available for sizing FMR1 CGG repeat expansions. 
      These methods offer higher diagnostic sensitivity and specificity compared to SB 
      analysis, significantly reduce the turnaround time and increase throughput. In 
      this chapter, we describe a triplet-repeat primed PCR protocol that employs 
      capillary electrophoresis to resolve the derived amplicon products, enabling 
      precise determination of the FMR1 genotypes in both males and females and 
      characterization of the CGG repeat structure.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused primarily by a CGG repeat expansion in the 
      FMR1 gene that triggers its transcriptional silencing. In order to investigate 
      the regulatory layers involved in FMR1 inactivation, we tested a collection of 
      chromatin modulators for the ability to reactivate the FMR1 locus. Although 
      inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) induced the highest levels of FMR1 
      expression, a combination of a DNMT inhibitor and another compound potentiated 
      the effect of reactivating treatment. To better assess the rescue effect 
      following direct demethylation, we characterized the long-term and genome-wide 
      effects of FMR1 reactivation and established an in vivo system to analyze 
      FMR1-reactivating therapies. Systemic treatment with a DNMT inhibitor in mice 
      carrying FXS induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived transplants robustly 
      induced FMR1 expression in the affected tissue, which was maintained for a 
      prolonged period of time. Finally, we show a proof of principle for 
      FMR1-reactivating therapy in the context of the CNS.

TI  - Repeat Instability in the Fragile X-Related Disorders: Lessons from a Mouse 
      Model.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci9030052 [doi]
LID - 52
AB  - The fragile X-related disorders (FXDs) are a group of clinical conditions that 
      result primarily from an unusual mutation, the expansion of a CGG-repeat tract in 
      exon 1 of the FMR1 gene. Mouse models are proving useful for understanding many 
      aspects of disease pathology in these disorders. There is also reason to think 
      that such models may be useful for understanding the molecular basis of the 
      unusual mutation responsible for these disorders. This review will discuss what 
      has been learnt to date about mechanisms of repeat instability from a knock-in 
      FXD mouse model and what the implications of these findings may be for humans 
      carrying expansion-prone FMR1 alleles.

TI  - Astroglial-targeted expression of the fragile X CGG repeat premutation in mice 
      yields RAN translation, motor deficits and possible evidence for cell-to-cell 
      propagation of FXTAS pathology.

AB  - The fragile X premutation is a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion between 55 and 
      200 repeats in the 5'-untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 
      (FMR1) gene. Human carriers of the premutation allele are at risk of developing 
      the late-onset neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome (FXTAS). Characteristic neuropathology associated with FXTAS includes 
      intranuclear inclusions in neurons and astroglia. Previous studies recapitulated 
      these histopathological features in neurons in a knock-in mouse model, but 
      without significant astroglial pathology. To determine the role of astroglia in 
      FXTAS, we generated a transgenic mouse line (Gfa2-CGG99-eGFP) that selectively 
      expresses a 99-CGG repeat expansion linked to an enhanced green fluorescent 
      protein (eGFP) reporter in astroglia throughout the brain, including cerebellar 
      Bergmann glia. Behaviorally these mice displayed impaired motor performance on 
      the ladder-rung test, but paradoxically better performance on the rotarod. 
      Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that CGG99-eGFP co-localized with GFAP and 
      S-100ss, but not with NeuN, Iba1, or MBP, indicating that CGG99-eGFP expression is 
      specific to astroglia. Ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions were found in 
      eGFP-expressing glia throughout the brain. In addition, intracytoplasmic 
      ubiquitin-positive inclusions were found outside the nucleus in distal astrocyte 
      processes. Intriguingly, intranuclear inclusions, in the absence of eGFP mRNA and 
      eGFP fluorescence, were present in neurons of the hypothalamus and neocortex. 
      Furthermore, intranuclear inclusions in both neurons and astrocytes displayed 
      immunofluorescent labeling for the polyglycine peptide FMRpolyG, implicating 
      FMRpolyG in the pathology found in Gfa2-CGG99 mice. Considered together, these 
      results show that Gfa2-CGG99 expression in mice is sufficient to induce key 
      features of FXTAS pathology, including formation of intranuclear inclusions, 
      translation of FMRpolyG, and deficits in motor function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with premutation alleles of the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are at risk of developing fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) during aging. Characterization of motor issues 
      associated with aging in FMR1 premutation carriers is needed to determine 
      neurodegenerative processes and establish new biobehavioral indicators to help 
      identify individuals at greatest risk of developing FXTAS. METHODS: We examined 
      postural stability in 18 premutation carriers ages 46-77 years and 14 age-matched 
      healthy controls. Participants completed a test of static stance and two tests of 
      dynamic postural sway on a force platform to quantify postural variability and 
      complexity. CGG repeat length was measured for each premutation carrier, and MRI 
      and neurological evaluations were conducted to identify carriers who currently 
      met criteria for FXTAS. Of the 18 premutation carriers, seven met criteria for 
      definite/probable FXTAS (FXTAS+), seven showed no MRI or neurological signs of 
      FXTAS (FXTAS-), and four were inconclusive due to insufficient data. RESULTS: 
      Compared to controls, premutation carriers showed increased center of pressure 
      (COP) variability in the mediolateral (COP(ML)) direction during static stance 
      and reduced COP variability in the anterior-posterior (COP(AP)) direction during 
      dynamic AP sway. They also showed reductions in COP(ML) complexity during each 
      postural condition. FXTAS+ individuals showed reduced COP(AP) variability 
      compared to FXTAS- carriers and healthy controls during dynamic AP sway. Across 
      all carriers, increased sway variability during static stance and decreased sway 
      variability in target directions during dynamic sways were associated with 
      greater CGG repeat length and more severe neurologically rated posture and gait 
      abnormalities. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that aging FMR1 premutation 
      carriers show static and dynamic postural control deficits relative to healthy 
      controls implicating degenerative processes of spinocerebellar and 
      cerebellar-brainstem circuits that may be independent of or precede the onset of 
      FXTAS. Our finding that FXTAS+ and FXTAS- premutation carriers differed on their 
      level of intentional AP sway suggests that neural mechanisms of dynamic postural 
      control may be differentially impacted in patients with FXTAS, and its 
      measurement may be useful for rapidly and precisely identifying disease presence 
      and onset.

      Israeli FMR1 Premutation Carriers.

AB  - Introduction: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common form of X-linked intellectual 
      and developmental disability with a prevalence of 1/4000-5000 in males and 
      1/6000-8000 in females. Most cases of the syndrome result from expansion of a 
      premutation (55-200 CGGs) to a full mutation (>200 CGGs) repeat located in the 5' 
      untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene. The risk for 
      full mutation expansions increases dramatically with increasing numbers of CGG 
      repeats. Recent studies, however, revealed AGG interruptions within the repeat 
      area function as a "protective factor" decreasing the risk of intergenerational 
      expansion. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted to validate the 
      relevance of AGG analysis for the ethnically diverse Israeli population. To 
      increase the accuracy of our results, we combined results from Israel with those 
      from the New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental 
      Disabilities (IBR). To the best of our knowledge this is the largest cohort of 
      different ethnicities to examine risks of unstable transmissions and full 
      mutation expansions among FMR1 premutation carriers. Results: The combined data 
      included 1471 transmissions of maternal premutation alleles: 369 (25.1%) stable 
      and 1,102 (74.9%) unstable transmissions. Full mutation expansions were 
      identified in 20.6% (303/1471) of transmissions. A total of 97.4% (388/397) of 
      transmissions from alleles with no AGGs were unstable, 79.6% (513/644) in alleles 
      with 1 AGG and 46.7% (201/430) in alleles with 2 or more AGGs. The same trend was 
      seen with full mutation expansions where 40% (159/397) of alleles with no AGGs 
      expanded to a full mutation, 20.2% (130/644) for alleles with 1 AGG and only 3.2% 
      (14/430) in alleles with 2 AGGs or more. None of the alleles with 3 or more AGGs 
      expanded to full mutations. Conclusion: We recommend that risk estimates for FMR1 
      premutation carriers be based on AGG interruptions as well as repeat size in 
      Israel and worldwide.

AB  - Expansion of a CGG-repeat tract in the 5' UTR of FMR1 is responsible for the 
      Fragile X-related disorders (FXDs), FXTAS, FXPOI and FXS. Previous work in a 
      mouse model of these disorders has implicated proteins in the base excision and 
      the mismatch repair (MMR) pathways in the expansion mechanism. However, the 
      precise role of these factors in this process is not well understood. The 
      essential role of MutLgamma, a complex that plays a minor role in MMR but that is 
      essential for resolving Holliday junctions during meiosis, raises the possibility 
      that expansions proceed via a Holliday junction-like intermediate that is 
      processed to generate a double-strand break (DSB). We show here in an FXD mouse 
      model that LIG4, a ligase essential for non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), a form 
      of DSB repair (DSBR), protects against expansions. However, a mutation in MRE11, 
      a nuclease that is important for several other DSBR pathways including homologous 
      recombination (HR), has no effect on the extent of expansion. Our results suggest 
      that the expansion pathway competes with NHEJ for the processing of a DSB 
      intermediate. Thus, expansion likely proceeds via an NHEJ-independent DSBR 
      pathway that may also be HR-independent.

AB  - Low FMR1 variants (CGGn<26) have been associated with premature ovarian aging, 
      female infertility and poor IVF treatment success. Until now, there is little 
      published information concerning possible molecular mechanisms for this effect. 
      We wished to examine whether relative expression of RNA and the FMR1 gene's 
      fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) RNA isoforms differ in women with 
      various FMR1 sub-genotypes (normal, low CGGn<26 and/or high CGGn>/=34). This 
      prospective cohort study was conducted between 2014 and 2017 in a clinical 
      research unit of the Center for Human Reproduction in New York City. The study 
      involved a total of 98 study subjects, including 18 young oocyte donors and 80 
      older infertility patients undergoing routine in vitro fertilization (IVF) 
      cycles. The main outcome measure was RNA expression in human luteinized granulosa 
      cells of 5 groups of FMRP isoforms. The relative expression of FMR1 RNA in human 
      luteinized granulosa cells was measured by real-time PCR and a possible 
      association with CGGn was explored. All 5 groups of FMRP RNA isoforms examined 
      were found to be differentially expressed in human luteinized granulosa cells. 
      The relative expression of four FMR1 RNA isoforms showed significant differences 
      among 6 FMR1 sub-genotypes. Women with at least one low allele expressed 
      significantly lower levels of all 5 sets of FRMP isoforms in comparison to the 
      non-low group. While it would be of interest to see whether FMRP is also 
      decreased in the low-group we recognize that in recent years it has been 
      increasingly documented that information flow of genetics may be regulated by 
      non-coding RNA, that is, without translation to a protein product. We, thus, 
      conclude that various CGG expansions of FMR1 allele may lead to changes of RNA 
      levels and ratios of distinct FMRP RNA isoforms, which could regulate the 
      translation and/or cellular localization of FMRP, affect the expression of 
      steroidogenic enzymes and hormonal receptors, or act in some other epigenetic 
      process and therefore result in the ovarian dysfunction in infertility.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The etiology of more than half of all patients with X-linked 
      intellectual disability remains elusive, despite array-based comparative genomic 
      hybridization, whole exome or genome sequencing. Since short read massive 
      parallel sequencing approaches do not allow the detection of larger tandem repeat 
      expansions, we hypothesized that such expansions could be a hidden cause of 
      X-linked intellectual disability. METHODS: We selectively captured over 1800 
      tandem repeats on the X chromosome and characterized them by long read single 
      molecule sequencing in 3 families with idiopathic X-linked intellectual 
      disability. RESULTS: In male DNA samples, full tandem repeat length sequences 
      were obtained for 88-93% of the targets and up to 99.6% of the repeats with a 
      moderate guanine-cytosine content. Read length and analysis pipeline allow to 
      detect cases of > 900 bp tandem repeat expansion. In one family, one repeat 
      expansion co-occurs with down-regulation of the neighboring MIR222 gene. This 
      gene has previously been implicated in intellectual disability and is apparently 
      linked to FMR1 and NEFH overexpression associated with neurological disorders. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the power of single molecule sequencing to 
      measure tandem repeat lengths and detect expansions, and suggests that tandem 
      repeat mutations may be a hidden cause of X-linked intellectual disability.

AB  - Recent evidence indicates that specific RNAs promote the formation of 
      ribonucleoprotein condensates by acting as scaffolds for RNA-binding proteins 
      (RBPs). We systematically investigated RNA-RBP interaction networks to understand 
      ribonucleoprotein assembly. We found that highly contacted RNAs are structured, 
      have long UTRs, and contain nucleotide repeat expansions. Among the RNAs with 
      such properties, we identified the FMR1 3' UTR that harbors CGG expansions 
      implicated in fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). We studied 
      FMR1 binding partners in silico and in vitro and prioritized the splicing 
      regulator TRA2A for further characterization. In a FXTAS cellular model, we 
      validated the TRA2A-FMR1 interaction and investigated implications of its 
      sequestration at both transcriptomic and post-transcriptomic levels. We found 
      that TRA2A co-aggregates with FMR1 in a FXTAS mouse model and in post-mortem 
      human samples. Our integrative study identifies key components of 
      ribonucleoprotein aggregates, providing links to neurodegenerative disease and 
      allowing the discovery of therapeutic targets.

AB  - Background: FMR1 CGG trinucleotide repeat hyper-expansions are observed in 99% of 
      individuals with fragile X mental retardation syndrome (FXS). We evaluated the 
      reliability of a rapid single-step gender-neutral molecular screen for FXS when 
      performed on DNA isolated from dried blood spots. Methods: DNA was extracted from 
      dried blood spots of 151 individuals with intellectual disability or autism 
      spectrum disorder, whose FMR1 repeat genotypes are known. Dried blood spots were 
      blinded prior to DNA extraction and analysis by triplet primed PCR (TP-PCR) and 
      melt curve analysis (MCA). All expansion-positive and representative 
      expansion-negative samples were also genotyped by fluorescent TP-PCR and 
      capillary electrophoresis (CE) to confirm repeat expansion status. Results: Three 
      males and 12 females were classified as expanded by TP-PCR MCA, and were 
      subsequently sized by fluorescent TP-PCR CE. Two males and four females carried 
      premutations, while one male and eight females carried full mutations. All 19 
      non-expanded samples that were sized were confirmed as carrying only normal 
      alleles. Replicate analysis of representative expansion-positive samples yielded 
      reproducible melt peak profiles. TP-PCR MCA classifications were completely 
      concordant with FMR1 CGG repeat genotypes. Conclusion: TP-PCR MCA of dried blood 
      spot DNA accurately and reliably identifies presence/absence of FMR1 CGG repeat 
      expansions in both genders simultaneously. This strategy may be suitable for 
      rapid high-throughput first-tier screening for fragile X syndrome.

TI  - Folate deficiency drives mitotic missegregation of the human FRAXA locus.
PG  - 13003-13008
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1808377115 [doi]
AB  - The instability of chromosome fragile sites is implicated as a causative factor 
      in several human diseases, including cancer [for common fragile sites (CFSs)] and 
      neurological disorders [for rare fragile sites (RFSs)]. Previous studies have 
      indicated that problems arising during DNA replication are the underlying source 
      of this instability. Although the role of replication stress in promoting 
      instability at CFSs is well documented, much less is known about how the 
      fragility of RFSs arises. Many RFSs, as exemplified by expansion of a CGG 
      trinucleotide repeat sequence in the fragile X syndrome-associated FRAXA locus, 
      exhibit fragility in response to folate deficiency or other forms of "folate 
      stress." We hypothesized that such folate stress, through disturbing the 
      replication program within the pathologically expanded repeats within FRAXA, 
      would lead to mitotic abnormalities that exacerbate locus instability. Here, we 
      show that folate stress leads to a dramatic increase in missegregation of FRAXA 
      coupled with the formation of single-stranded DNA bridges in anaphase and 
      micronuclei that contain the FRAXA locus. Moreover, chromosome X aneuploidy is 
      seen when these cells are exposed to folate deficiency for an extended period. We 
      propose that problematic FRAXA replication during interphase leads to a failure 
      to disjoin the sister chromatids during anaphase. This generates further 
      instability not only at FRAXA itself but also of chromosome X. These data have 
      wider implications for the effects of folate deficiency on chromosome instability 
      in human cells.

AB  - Pathological mutations involving noncoding microsatellite repeats are typically 
      located near promoters in CpG islands and are coupled with extensive repeat 
      instability when sufficiently long. What causes these regions to be prone to 
      repeat instability is not fully understood. There is a general consensus that 
      instability results from the induction of unusual structures in the DNA by the 
      repeats as a consequence of mispairing between complementary strands. In 
      addition, there is some evidence that repeat instability is mediated by RNA 
      transcription through the formation of three-stranded nucleic structures composed 
      of persistent DNA:RNA hybrids, concomitant with single-strand DNA displacements 
      (R-loops). Using human embryonic stem cells with wild-type and repeat expanded 
      alleles in the FMR1 (CGGs) and C9orf72 (GGGGCCs) genes, we show that these loci 
      constitute preferential sites (hotspots) for DNA unpairing. When R-loops are 
      formed, DNA unpairing is more extensive, and is coupled with the interruptions of 
      double-strand structures by the nontranscribing (G-rich) DNA strand. These 
      interruptions are likely to reflect unusual structures in the DNA that drive 
      repeat instability when the G-rich repeats considerably expand. Further, we 
      demonstrate that when the CGGs in FMR1 are hyper-methylated and transcriptionally 
      inactive, local DNA unpairing is abolished. Our study thus takes one more step 
      toward the identification of dynamic, unconventional DNA structures across the 
      G-rich repeats at FMR1 and C9orf72 disease-associated loci.

PG  - 412-422

AB  - Although temperament has been studied for decades as a predictor of 
      psychopathology in the general population, examining temperament in neurogenetic 
      groups has unique potential to inform the genetic and biological factors that may 
      confer risk for psychopathology in later development. The present study examined 
      early temperament in two heritable neurogenetic conditions associated with 
      atypical CGG repeat expansions on the FMR1 gene: the FMR1 premutation (FXpm; 
      55-200 repeats) and fragile X syndrome (FXS; > 200 repeats). We focus 
      specifically on the FXpm, as the condition is highly prevalent (1:209-291 female 
      individuals, 1:430-855 male individuals) and has been preliminarily associated 
      with increased risk for pediatric psychopathology, including attention problems, 
      autism, and anxiety. In contrast, FXS is a low-incidence disorder (1:7,143 males, 
      1:11,111 females) often associated with intellectual disability and severe 
      co-occurring psychosocial conditions, particularly in male individuals. Given 
      information on infant clinical phenotypes in the FXpm and FXS is sparse, we aimed 
      to characterize parent-reported infant temperament in infants with the FXpm 
      (n = 22) relative to FXS (n = 24) and controls (n = 24) assessed on 1 to 3 
      occasions each. Temperament in infants with the FXpm largely fell between TD and 
      FXS groups, with trends toward suppressed negative affect in younger 
      participants, similar to lower negative affect previously reported in FXS. The 
      FXS group consistently demonstrated lower negative affect and surgency than TD 
      controls. These data suggest that FMR1 gene mutations are associated with 
      atypical temperament that emerges as early as infancy, particularly among infants 
      with FXS, warranting further study of whether temperament may index emergent 
      clinical risks in these populations.

AB  - The Fragile X-related disorders (FXDs) are Repeat Expansion Diseases resulting 
      from an expansion of a CGG-repeat tract at the 5' end of the FMR1 gene. The 
      mechanism responsible for this unusual mutation is not fully understood. We have 
      previously shown that mismatch repair (MMR) complexes, MSH2/MSH3 (MutSbeta) and 
      MSH2/MSH6 (MutSalpha), together with Polbeta, a DNA polymerase important for base 
      excision repair (BER), are important for expansions in a mouse model of these 
      disorders. Here we show that MLH1/MLH3 (MutLgamma), a protein complex that can act 
      downstream of MutSbeta in MMR, is also required for all germ line and somatic 
      expansions. However, exonuclease I (EXO1), which acts downstream of MutL proteins 
      in MMR, is not required. In fact, a null mutation in Exo1 results in more 
      extensive germ line and somatic expansions than is seen in Exo1+/+ animals. 
      Furthermore, mice homozygous for a point mutation (D173A) in Exo1 that eliminates 
      its nuclease activity but retains its native conformation, shows a level of 
      expansion that is intermediate between Exo1+/+ and Exo1-/- animals. Thus, our 
      data suggests that expansion of the FX repeat in this mouse model occurs via a 
      MutLgamma-dependent, EXO1-independent pathway, with EXO1 protecting against expansion 
      both in a nuclease-dependent and a nuclease-independent manner. Our data thus 
      have implications for the expansion mechanism and add to our understanding of the 
      genetic factors that may be modifiers of expansion risk in humans.

TI  - Genetic mutations in Ca(2+) signaling alter dendrite morphology and social 
      approach in juvenile mice.
PG  - e12526
LID - 10.1111/gbb.12526 [doi]
AB  - Dendritic morphology is a critical determinant of neuronal connectivity, and 
      calcium signaling plays a predominant role in shaping dendrites. Altered 
      dendritic morphology and genetic mutations in calcium signaling are both 
      associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). In this study we tested the 
      hypothesis that dendritic arborization and NDD-relevant behavioral phenotypes are 
      altered by human mutations that modulate calcium-dependent signaling pathways 
      implicated in NDDs. The dendritic morphology of pyramidal neurons in CA1 
      hippocampus and somatosensory cortex was quantified in Golgi-stained brain 
      sections from juvenile mice of both sexes expressing either a human 
      gain-of-function mutation in ryanodine receptor 1 (T4826I-RYR1), a human CGG 
      repeat expansion (170-200 CGG repeats) in the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 
      (FMR1 premutation), both mutations (double mutation; DM), or wildtype mice. In 
      hippocampal neurons, increased dendritic arborization was observed in male 
      T4826I-RYR1 and, to a lesser extent, male FMR1 premutation neurons. Dendritic 
      morphology of cortical neurons was altered in both sexes of FMR1 premutation and 
      DM animals with the most pronounced differences seen in DM females. Genotype also 
      impaired behavior, as assessed using the three-chambered social approach test. 
      The most striking lack of sociability was observed in DM male and female mice. In 
      conclusion, mutations that alter the fidelity of calcium signaling enhance 
      dendritic arborization in a brain region- and sex-specific manner and impair 
      social behavior in juvenile mice. The phenotypic outcomes of these mutations 
      likely provide a susceptible biological substrate for additional environmental 
      stressors that converge on calcium signaling to determine individual NDD risk.

      maternal well-being.

AB  - The present study investigated the effects of children without disabilities on 
      maternal physical and mental health in families with adolescents or adults with 
      fragile X syndrome. Mothers with the FMR1 premutation (N = 87) reported on 
      behavior problems and functional limitations of their adolescent or adult child 
      with fragile X syndrome and their own physical and mental health. Mothers also 
      provided a blood sample to determine FMR1 CGG repeat length. The proportion of 
      unaffected children in the family significantly buffered the effect of both child 
      behavior problems and functional limitations on maternal self-rated health, such 
      that having a higher proportion of unaffected children in the family had a 
      protective effect on maternal health when the target child had more severe 
      behavior problems and functional limitations. There was a similar buffering 
      process for maternal depressive symptoms but at a trend level. Additionally, 
      maternal CGG repeat length had a significant curvilinear association with 
      self-rated health, indicating that mothers with midrange repeat lengths reported 
      the poorest health, whereas mothers with lower and higher repeat lengths in the 
      premutation range reported better health. The data suggest that unaffected 
      children in the family may be an important resource for premutation carrier 
      mothers. Findings are consistent with previous research indicating that mothers 
      with varying levels of genetic liability have variable risk for health problems.

TI  - Curvilinear Association Between Language Disfluency and FMR1 CGG Repeat Size 
      Across the Normal, Intermediate, and Premutation Range.

AB  - Historically, investigations of FMR1 have focused almost exclusively on the 
      clinical effects of CGG expansion within the categories of the premutation 
      (55-200 CGG repeats) and fragile X syndrome (>200 CGG repeats). However, emerging 
      evidence suggests that CGG-dependent phenotypes may occur across allele sizes 
      traditionally considered within the "normal" range. This study adopted an 
      individual-differences approach to determine the association between language 
      production ability and CGG repeat length across the full range of normal, 
      intermediate, and premutation alleles. Participants included 61 adult women with 
      CGG repeats within the premutation (n = 37), intermediate (i.e., 41-54 repeats; n 
      = 2), or normal (i.e., 6-40 repeats; n = 22) ranges. All participants were the 
      biological mothers of a child with a developmental disorder, to control for the 
      potential effects of parenting stress. Language samples were collected and the 
      frequency of language disfluencies (i.e., interruptions in the flow of speech) 
      served as an index of language production skills. Verbal inhibition skills, 
      measured with the Hayling Sentence Completion Test, were also measured and 
      examined as a correlate of language disfluency, consistent with theoretical work 
      linking language disfluency with inhibitory deficits (i.e., the Inhibition 
      Deficit Hypothesis). Blood samples were collected to determine FMR1 CGG repeat 
      size. A general linear model tested CGG repeat size of the larger allele 
      (allele-2) as the primary predictor of language disfluency, covarying for 
      education level, IQ, age, and CGG repeats on the other allele. A robust 
      curvilinear association between CGG length and language disfluency was detected, 
      where low-normal ( approximately  <25 repeats) and mid-premutation alleles ( approximately 90-110 repeats) 
      were linked with higher rates of disfluency. Disfluency was not associated with 
      inhibition deficits, which challenges prior theoretical work and suggests that a 
      primary language deficit could account for elevated language disfluency in 
      FMR1-associated conditions. Findings suggest CGG-dependent variation in language 
      production ability, which was evident across individuals with and without CGG 
      expansions on FMR1.

AB  - More than 25 inherited human disorders are caused by the unstable expansion of 
      repetitive DNA sequences termed short tandem repeats (STRs). A fundamental 
      unresolved question is why some STRs are susceptible to pathologic expansion, 
      whereas thousands of repeat tracts across the human genome are relatively stable. 
      Here, we discover that nearly all disease-associated STRs (daSTRs) are located at 
      boundaries demarcating 3D chromatin domains. We identify a subset of boundaries 
      with markedly higher CpG island density compared to the rest of the genome. 
      daSTRs specifically localize to ultra-high-density CpG island boundaries, 
      suggesting they might be hotspots for epigenetic misregulation or topological 
      disruption linked to STR expansion. Fragile X syndrome patients exhibit severe 
      boundary disruption in a manner that correlates with local loss of CTCF occupancy 
      and the degree of FMR1 silencing. Our data uncover higher-order chromatin 
      architecture as a new dimension in understanding repeat expansion disorders.

TI  - High expression of miR-510 was associated with CGG expansion located at upstream 
      of FMR1 into full mutation.
PG  - 1916-1923
LID - 10.1002/jcb.27505 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to play an important role in the regulation of 
      gene expression in eukaryotic organisms at the posttranscriptional level. More 
      than half of miRNA genes have been recognized to be located in different fragile 
      sites. Among them, miR-510 was located on chromosome X in the 27.3Xq region, 
      flanking to a fragile X site. The CGG expansion and its methylation at the 
      promoter of FMR1 located in this fragile site were associated with clinical 
      symptoms of fragile X syndrome (FXS). The aim of the current study was to 
      investigate whether the miR-510 expression was correlated with the CGG expansion 
      of FMR1 in female carriers of full mutation. For this purpose, mesenchymal stem 
      cells were isolated from peripheral blood of FMR1 full mutation female carriers. 
      After differentiation of these cells into neuronal cells, the expression of 
      miR-510 was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, the 
      target genes of miR-510 in the nervous system were also predicted by in silico 
      method. The obtained results indicated that the CGG expansion of FMR1 was 
      associated with the enhanced expression of miR-510. Furthermore, the 
      bioinformatics analysis suggested that VHL and PPP2R5E genes could be considered 
      as the most important target genes of miR-510 in the nervous system. This study 
      showed that miR-510 and its target genes, specifically VHL and PPP2R5E, may 
      represent the new targets for future therapy options of FXS.

AB  - Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual 
      disability and autism. It results from expansion of a CGG nucleotide repeat in 
      the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of FMR1. Large expansions elicit repeat and 
      promoter hyper-methylation, heterochromatin formation, FMR1 transcriptional 
      silencing and loss of the Fragile X protein, FMRP. Efforts aimed at correcting 
      the sequelae resultant from FMRP loss have thus far proven insufficient, perhaps 
      because of FMRP's pleiotropic functions. As the repeats do not disrupt the FMRP 
      coding sequence, reactivation of endogenous FMR1 gene expression could correct 
      the proximal event in FXS pathogenesis. Here we utilize the Clustered Regularly 
      Interspaced Palindromic Repeats/deficient CRISPR associated protein 9 
      (CRISPR/dCas9) system to selectively re-activate transcription from the silenced 
      FMR1 locus. Fusion of the transcriptional activator VP192 to dCas9 robustly 
      enhances FMR1 transcription and increases FMRP levels when targeted directly to 
      the CGG repeat in human cells. Using a previously uncharacterized FXS human 
      embryonic stem cell (hESC) line which acquires transcriptional silencing with 
      serial passaging, we achieved locus-specific transcriptional re-activation of 
      FMR1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression despite promoter and repeat methylation. 
      However, these changes at the transcript level were not coupled with a 
      significant elevation in FMRP protein expression in FXS cells. These studies 
      demonstrate that directing a transcriptional activator to CGG repeats is 
      sufficient to selectively reactivate FMR1 mRNA expression in Fragile X patient 
      stem cells.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by the maternal expansion of an unstable 
      CGG-repeat tract located in the first exon of the FMR1 gene. Further changes in 
      repeat number occur during embryogenesis resulting in individuals sometimes being 
      highly mosaic. Here we show in a mouse model that, in males, expansions are 
      already present in primary spermatocytes with no additional expansions occurring 
      in later stages of gametogenesis. We also show that, in females, expansion occurs 
      in the post-natal oocyte. Additional expansions and a high frequency of large 
      contractions are seen in two-cell stage embryos. Expansion in oocytes, which are 
      non-dividing, would be consistent with a mechanism involving aberrant DNA repair 
      or recombination rather than a problem with chromosomal replication. Given the 
      difficulty of replicating large CGG-repeat tracts, we speculate that very large 
      expanded alleles may be prone to contract in the mitotically proliferating 
      spermatagonial stem cells in men. However, expanded alleles may not be under such 
      pressure in the non-dividing oocyte. The high degree of both expansions and 
      contractions seen in early embryos may contribute to the high frequency of 
      somatic mosaicism that is observed in humans. Our data thus suggest an 
      explanation for the fact that FXS is exclusively maternally transmitted and lend 
      support to models for repeat expansion that are based on problems arising during 
      DNA repair.

AB  - Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a reproductive disease which affects 1 in 100 
      under 40...years women. FMR1 premutation carriers of CGG repeats are supposed to be 
      at increased risk for POF. We have examined the 5'UTR region of the gene to find 
      any association between the repeat size and the disease etiology in Iranian 
      population. 30 women with early idiopathic POF and 30 fertile control women were 
      selected. We used triplet repeat primed PCR (TP PCR) assay and gene-specific 
      primers to amplify the CpG Island of FMR1 gene promoter region. The amplification 
      results were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis and Gene Marker software. 
      Among 30 patients, two had intermediate repeat size, one had premutation and the 
      rest had CGG repeat of the normal range. Two of controls had intermediate repeats 
      and none had a premutation. Two groups had significant differences in the repeat 
      number average (p...=...0.007) and in the average length of the smallest allele 
      (p...<...0.001), but had no promising difference in average length of the longest 
      allele (p...=...0.453). Although the two groups showed a significant difference in 
      the length of alleles, their length was within normal range. Perhaps the 
      polymorphism, in connection with the genome's entire network, has been involved 
      in the development of the disease, or there has been a fundamentally different 
      mechanism for the disease in Iranian population. A larger number of Iranian POF 
      patients should be investigated for any probable relationship between the CGG 
      triplet repeat length and the etiology of the disease.

AB  - The Fragile X-related disorders (FXDs) are members of a large group of human 
      neurological or neurodevelopmental conditions known as the Repeat Expansion 
      Diseases. The mutation responsible for all of these diseases is an expansion in 
      the size of a disease-specific tandem repeat tract. However, the underlying cause 
      of this unusual mutation is unknown. Genome-wide association studies have 
      identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vicinity of the FAN1 
      (MIM* 613534) gene that are associated with variations in the age at onset of a 
      number of Repeat Expansion Diseases. FAN1 is a nuclease that has both 5'-3' 
      exonuclease and 5' flap endonuclease activities. Here we show in a model for the 
      FXDs that Fan1(-/-) mice have expansions that, in some tissues including brain, 
      are 2-3 times as extensive as they are in Fan1(+/+) mice. However, no effect of 
      the loss of FAN1 was apparent for germ line expansions. Thus, FAN1 plays an 
      important role in protecting against somatic expansions but is either not 
      involved in protecting against intergenerational repeat expansions or is 
      redundant with other related enzymes. However, since loss of FAN1 results in 
      increased expansions in brain and other somatic tissue, FAN1 polymorphisms may be 
      important disease modifiers in those Repeat Expansion Diseases in which somatic 
      expansion contributes to age at onset or disease severity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile-X-Mental-Retardation-1- (FMR1)-gene is supposed to be a key 
      gene for ovarian reserve and folliculogenesis. It contains in its 5'-UTR a 
      triplet-base-repeat (CGG), that varies between 26 and 34 in general population. 
      CGG-repeat-lengths with 55-200 repeats (pre-mutation = PM) show instable heredity 
      with a tendency to increase and are associated with 
      premature-ovarian-insufficiency or failure (POI/POF) in about 20%. 
      FMR1-mRNA-expression in leucocytes and granulosa cells (GCs) increases with 
      CGG-repeat-length in PM-carriers, but variable FMR1-expression profiles were also 
      described in women with POI without PM-FMR1 repeat-length. Additionally, 
      associations between low numbers of retrieved oocytes and elevated 
      FMR1-expression levels have been shown in GCs of females with mid-range 
      PM-CGG-repeats without POI. Effects of FMR1-repeat-lengths-deviations (n < 26 or 
      n > 34) below the PM range (n < 55) on ovarian reserve and response to ovarian 
      stimulation remain controversial. METHODS: We enrolled 229 women undergoing 
      controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF/ICSI-treatment and devided them in 
      three ovarian-response-subgroups: Poor responder (POR) after Bologna Criteria, 
      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO) after Rotterdam Criteria, or normal responder 
      (NOR, control group). Subjects were subdivided into six genotypes according to 
      their be-allelic CGG-repeat length. FMR1-CGG-repeat-length was determined using 
      ALF-express-DNA-sequencer or ABI 3100/3130 x 1-sequencer. mRNA was extracted from 
      GCs after follicular aspiration and quantitative FMR1-expression was determined 
      using specific TaqMan-Assay and applying the DeltaDeltaCT method. Kruskall-Wallis-Test or 
      ANOVA were used for simple comparison between ovarian reserve (NOR, POR or PCO) 
      and CGG-subgroups or cohort demographic data. All statistical analysis were 
      performed with SPSS and statistical significance was set at p </= 0.05. RESULTS: A 
      statistically significant increase in FMR1-mRNA-expression-levels was detected in 
      GCs of PORs with heterozygous normal/low-CGG-repeat-length compared with other 
      genotypes (p = 0.044). CONCLUSION: Female ovarian response may be negatively 
      affected by low CGG-alleles during stimulation. In addition, due to a 
      low-allele-effect, folliculogenesis may be impaired already prior to stimulation 
      leading to diminished ovarian reserve and poor ovarian response. A better 
      understanding of FMR1 expression-regulation in GCs may help to elucidate 
      pathomechanisms of folliculogenesis disorders and to develop risk-adjusted 
      treatments for IVF/ICSI-therapy. Herewith FMR1-genotyping potentially provides a 
      better estimatation of treatment outcome and allows the optimal adaptation of 
      stimulation protocols in future.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by expanded CGG (CGG(exp)) trinucleotides in 
      the 5'UTR of the FMR1 gene encoding fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). 
      The patients, with the number of the repeats ranging from 55 to 200, show 
      specific manifestation of clinical symptoms that include intention tremor, gait 
      ataxia, cognitive deficits, and brain atrophy. Accumulation of toxic polyglycine 
      (FMRpolyG), a by-product of the CGG(exp) repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) 
      translation, is considered to be one of the main factors triggering 
      neurodegenerative processes in FXTAS patients. Nevertheless, the nature of the 
      FMRpolyG-induced cell damage, especially in the context of its soluble and 
      inclusion-associated forms, is still elusive. Targeting either biosynthesis, 
      cellular stability or aggregation capacity of toxic FMRpolyG could be considered 
      as a potential therapeutic strategy for FXTAS. Therefore, we tested a variety of 
      quantitative methods based on forced expression of genetic constructs carrying 
      CGG(exp) repeats in the context of the FMR1 5'UTR fused to GFP, mCherry or 
      Firefly luciferase gene in or out of frame to the polyglycine encoding sequence. 
      We show that FMRpolyG translation either from native or an AUG-induced start 
      codon as well as the translation yield of the FMRP open reading frame equivalent 
      located downstream of the CGG(exp) element can be effectively estimated using 
      fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry or luciferase assay. We also 
      quantitatively estimated soluble fraction and insoluble form of FMRpolyG 
      aggregated in foci using an electrophoretic separation of cell lysates and 
      fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Importantly, we show that dependent on a 
      fusion tag, FMRpolyG has a different potential for aggregate formation. Our 
      established protocols enable sensitive tracking of FMRP and FMRpolyG quantitative 
      and qualitative changes after treatment with potential therapeutic agents for 
      FXTAS. Furthermore, they can be modified for application to other RAN 
      translation- and aggregation-related diseases.

TI  - Prenatal Diagnosis of Fragile X Syndrome in a Twin Pregnancy Complicated by a 
      Complete Retraction.
LID - 10.3390/genes9060287 [doi]
LID - 287
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is usually associated with a CGG repeat expansion >200 
      repeats within the FMR1 gene, known as a full mutation (FM). FM alleles produce 
      abnormal methylation of the FMR1 promoter with reduction or silencing of FMR1 
      gene expression. Furthermore, premutation (PM: 55(-)199 CGGs) and full mutation 
      alleles usually expand in size when maternally transmitted to progeny. This study 
      describes a PM allele carried by the mother decreasing to a normal sized allele 
      in a male from a dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twin pregnancy, with the female 
      twin inheriting FM (200(-)790 CGGs), PM (130 CGGs) and normal-sized (39 CGGs) 
      alleles. Further evidence of instability of the maternal PM allele was shown by a 
      male proband (older brother) mosaic for PM (CGG 78 and 150 CGGs) and FM (200(-)813 
      CGGs), and a high level of FMR1 promoter methylation, between 50 and 70%, in 
      multiple tissues. The fully-retracted, normal-sized allele was identified by PCR 
      CGG sizing in the male twin, with no evidence of a FM allele identified using 
      Southern blot analysis in multiple tissues collected postnatally and prenatally. 
      Consistent with this, prenatal PCR sizing (35 CGGs) showed inconsistent 
      inheritance of the maternal normal allele (30 CGGs), with single-nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP) linkage analysis confirming that the abnormal FMR1 chromosome 
      had been inherited from the mother's PM chromosome. Importantly, the male twin 
      showed no significant hypermethylation of the FMR1 promoter in all pre and 
      postnatal tissues tested, as well as normal levels of FMR1 mRNA in blood. In 
      summary, this report demonstrates the first postnatal follow up of a prenatal 
      case in which FMR1 mRNA levels were approaching normal, with normal levels of 
      FMR1 promoter methylation and normal CGG size in multiple pre and postnatally 
      collected tissues.

      Single-Molecule Sequencing: A 1 Year Clinical Experience.

AB  - The fragile X syndrome arises from the FMR1 CGG expansion of a premutation 
      (55-200 repeats) to a full mutation allele (>200 repeats) and is the most 
      frequent cause of inherited X-linked intellectual disability. The risk for a 
      premutation to expand to a full mutation allele depends on the repeat length and 
      AGG triplets interrupting this repeat. In genetic counseling it is important to 
      have information on both these parameters to provide an accurate risk estimate to 
      women carrying a premutation allele and weighing up having children. For example, 
      in case of a small risk a woman might opt for a natural pregnancy followed up by 
      prenatal diagnosis while she might choose for preimplantation genetic diagnosis 
      (PGD) if the risk is high. Unfortunately, the detection of AGG interruptions was 
      previously hampered by technical difficulties complicating their use in 
      diagnostics. Therefore we recently developed, validated and implemented a new 
      methodology which uses long-read single-molecule sequencing to identify AGG 
      interruptions in females with a FMR1 premutation. Here we report on the assets of 
      AGG interruption detection by sequencing and the impact of implementing the assay 
      on genetic counseling.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual 
      disability and the leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder. It has 
      previously been demonstrated that prenatal genetic diagnosis is efficient for the 
      diagnosis of FXS. The present study investigated the diagnostic effects of nested 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) and 
      expanded CGG repeats. It was demonstrated that the nested PCR assay rapidly 
      measured the multi-copies of the FMR1 gene in individual samples. The nested PCR 
      assay detected normal CGG repeat lengths and expanded CGG repeat lengths with a 
      low occurrence of false positives. In addition, the nested PCR assay resulted in 
      increased sensitivity and specificity for patients with FXS. Furthermore, the 
      nested PCR assay identified the mutation and generated conclusive cases for FXS, 
      indicating that this assay is beneficial for the diagnosis of FXS patients. In 
      conclusion, these outcomes indicate that nested PCR assay is a reliable and 
      easier method for diagnosis of FXS, which may be used for the diagnosis of FXS 
      patients.

TI  - BC RNA Mislocalization in the Fragile X Premutation.
LID - 10.1523/ENEURO.0091-18.2018 [doi]
LID - ENEURO.0091-18.2018
AB  - Fragile X premutation disorder is caused by CGG triplet repeat expansions in the 
      5' untranslated region of FMR1 mRNA. The question of how expanded CGG repeats 
      cause disease is a subject of continuing debate. Our work indicates that 
      CGG-repeat structures compete with regulatory BC1 RNA for access to RNA transport 
      factor hnRNP A2. As a result, BC1 RNA is mislocalized in vivo, as its 
      synapto-dendritic presence is severely diminished in brains of CGG-repeat 
      knock-in animals (a premutation mouse model). Lack of BC1 RNA is known to cause 
      seizure activity and cognitive dysfunction. Our working hypothesis thus predicted 
      that absence, or significantly reduced presence, of BC1 RNA in synapto-dendritic 
      domains of premutation animal neurons would engender cognate phenotypic 
      alterations. Testing this prediction, we established epileptogenic susceptibility 
      and cognitive impairments as major phenotypic abnormalities of CGG premutation 
      mice. In CA3 hippocampal neurons of such animals, synaptic release of glutamate 
      elicits neuronal hyperexcitability in the form of group I metabotropic glutamate 
      receptor-dependent prolonged epileptiform discharges. CGG-repeat knock-in animals 
      are susceptible to sound-induced seizures and are cognitively impaired as 
      revealed in the Attentional Set Shift Task. These phenotypic disturbances occur 
      in young-adult premutation animals, indicating that a neurodevelopmental deficit 
      is an early-initial manifestation of the disorder. The data are consistent with 
      the notion that RNA mislocalization can contribute to pathogenesis.

      at the Fragile X Mental Retardation Gene.

AB  - The fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by a CGG repeat expansion at the fragile X 
      mental retardation (FMR1) gene. FMR1 alleles with more than 200 CGG repeats bear 
      chromosomal fragility when cells experience folate deficiency. CGG repeats were 
      reported to be able to form secondary structures, such as hairpins, in vitro. 
      When such secondary structures are formed, repeats can lead to replication fork 
      stalling even in the absence of any additional perturbation. Indeed, it was 
      recently shown that the replication forks stall at the endogenous FMR1 locus in 
      unaffected and FXS cells, suggesting the formation of secondary repeat structures 
      at the FMR1 gene in vivo. If not dealt with properly replication fork stalling 
      can lead to polymerase slippage and repeat expansion as well as fragile site 
      expression. Despite the presence of repeat structures at the FMR1 locus, 
      chromosomal fragility is only expressed under replicative stress suggesting the 
      existence of potential molecular mechanisms that help the replication fork 
      progress through these repeat regions. DNA helicases are known to aid replication 
      forks progress through repetitive DNA sequences. Yet, the identity of the DNA 
      helicase(s) responsible for unwinding the CGG repeats at FMR1 locus is not known. 
      We found that the human DNA helicase B (HDHB) may provide an answer for this 
      question. We used chromatin-immunoprecipitation assay to study the FMR1 region 
      and common fragile sites (CFS), and asked whether HDHB localizes at replication 
      forks stalled at repetitive regions even in unperturbed cells. HDHB was strongly 
      enriched in S-phase at the repetitive DNA at CFS and FMR1 gene but not in the 
      flanking regions. Taken together, these results suggest that HDHB functions in 
      preventing or repairing stalled replication forks that arise in repeat-rich 
      regions even in unperturbed cells. Furthermore, we discuss the importance and 
      potential role of HDHB and other helicases in the resolution of secondary CGG 
      repeat structures.

TI  - Haplotype Analysis of DXS548 and FRAXAC1 Microsatellite Loci in Iranian Patients 
      with Fragile X Syndrome.
PG  - 36-46
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of inherited mental 
      retardation caused by expansion of a (CGG) repeat region up to 1000 repeat in 5' 
      region of the FMR1 gene located in FRAXA locus Xq27.3. To better understand the 
      mechanism involved in expansion of CGG region, the molecular characteristic of 
      the flanking microsatellite markers in the region must be clarify in different 
      populations. We aimed to examine the potential association between specific 
      haplotype and the expanded AC-repeat region in cases and controls chromosomes. 
      MATERIALS & METHODS: Forty unrelated FXS males and 62 unrelated normal males 
      originating from various regions of Iran were haplotyped by analyzing two 
      CA-repeat markers, FRAXAC1 and DXS548. RESULTS: Significant linkage 
      disequilibrium was obtained between DXS548 and FRAXAC1 specific marker alleles 
      and CGG repeat expansion among 40 fragile X cases compared to 62 normal controls. 
      The frequencies of DXS548 and FRAXAC1 longer alleles in patients were 
      significantly higher than that in control group. Two FRAXAC1 long alleles were 
      only observed in cases, possibly due to concatenated mutations. The increase of 
      heterozygosities in fragile X cases (DXS548 78.6%, FRAXAC1 64.6%) in comparison 
      to the controls (DXS548 63.0%, FRAXAC1 47.0%) showed a multimodal distribution of 
      fragile X associated alleles. CONCLUSION: Haplotype analyses with DXS548 and 
      FRAXAC1 markers represented that haplotype distribution in the normal controls 
      and FXS patients were significantly different, representing a weak founder 
      effect.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual 
      disability, is also highly associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It is 
      caused by expansion of a CGG repeat sequence on the X chromosome resulting in 
      silencing of the FMR1 gene. This is modeled in the mouse by deletion of Fmr1 
      (Fmr1 KO). Fmr1 KO mice recapitulate many of the behavioral features of the 
      disorder including seizure susceptibility, hyperactivity, impaired social 
      behavior, sleep problems, and learning and memory deficits. The mammalian target 
      of rapamycin pathway (mTORC1) is upregulated in Fmr1 KO mice and is thought to be 
      important for the pathogenesis of this disorder. We treated Fmr1 KO mice 
      chronically with an mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin, to determine if rapamycin 
      treatment could reverse behavioral phenotypes. We performed open field, zero 
      maze, social behavior, sleep, passive avoidance, and audiogenic seizure testing. 
      We found that pS6 was upregulated in Fmr1 KO mice and normalized by rapamycin 
      treatment, but, except for an anxiogenic effect, it did not reverse any of the 
      behavioral phenotypes examined. In fact, rapamycin treatment had an adverse 
      effect on sleep and social behavior in both control and Fmr1 KO mice. These 
      results suggest that targeting the mTOR pathway in FXS is not a good treatment 
      strategy and that other pathways should be considered.

      SCA patients negative for the most common SCA subtypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) subtypes are often caused by expansions 
      in non-coding regions of genes like SCA8, SCA10, SCA12 and SCA36. Other ataxias 
      are known to be associated with repeat expansions such as fragile X-associated 
      tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) or expansions in the C9orf72 gene. When no 
      mutation has been identified in the aforementioned genes next-generation 
      sequencing (NGS)-based diagnostics may also be applied. In order to define an 
      optimal diagnostic strategy, more information about the frequency and phenotypic 
      characteristics of rare repeat expansion disorders associated with ataxia should 
      be at hand. METHODS: We analyzed a consecutive cohort of 440 German unrelated 
      patients with symptoms of cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria and other unspecific 
      symptoms who were referred to our center for SCA diagnostics. They showed alleles 
      in the normal range for the most common SCA subtypes SCA1-3, SCA6, SCA7 and 
      SCA17. These patients were screened for expansions causing SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA36 and FXTAS as well as for the pathogenic hexanucleotide repeat in the 
      C9orf72 gene. RESULTS: Expanded repeats for SCA10, SCA12 or SCA36 were not 
      identified in the analyzed patients. Five patients showed expanded SCA8 CTA/CTG 
      alleles with 92-129 repeats. One 51-year-old male with unclear dementia symptoms 
      was diagnosed with a large GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72. The analysis of 
      the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) revealed one patient with a 
      premutation (>50 CGG repeats) and seven patients with alleles in the grey zone 
      (41 to 54 CGG repeats). CONCLUSIONS: Altogether five patients showed 92 or more 
      SCA8 CTA/CTG combined repeats. Our results support the assumption that smaller 
      FMR1 gene expansions could be associated with the risk of developing neurological 
      signs. The results do not support genetic testing for C9orf72 expansion in ataxia 
      patients.

      Findings of Hacettepe Fragile X Registry.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine frequency of fragile X associated premature ovarian 
      insufficiency (FXPOI) among Turkish premutation carriers. STUDY DESIGN: FMR1 
      premutation is the single most common genetic cause of POI (FXPOI). Fragile X 
      Registry at Hacettepe University has been reviewed for the frequency of FXPOI 
      among female premutation carriers. Since 1991 when FMR1 testing was available, 
      760 individuals from 243 families have been registered. Actual data on menstrual 
      status of female premutation carriers were gathered and analysed. RESULTS: Among 
      314 premutation-bearing females in the cohort, 268 could be reached for an update 
      of their menstrual history; 107 adults were 40 or younger and 156 were older than 
      40 years of age, whereas the remaining 5 patients were prepubertal. Among 263 
      postpubertal females with premutations, 90 women stopped menstruating before or 
      at 40 years of age (premature ovarian failure - POF), constituting 34.2% of our 
      cohort. Additionally, one carrier of a gray zone allele experienced FXPOI. 
      History of twinning was present once in 18 women (5.7%) and twice in two women 
      (0.6%), one of the latter interestingly bearing a full-mutation. CONCLUSIONS: 
      FXPOI rates in the present cohort are higher than those reported in other 
      populations. Higher FXPOI rates in Turkish premutation carriers might be a 
      reflection of younger mean menopause age and higher POI rates in otherwise 
      healthy Turkish women. Since POI is much more frequent among premutation carriers 
      than in general population, testing for CGG repeat expansions in FMR1 should be 
      included in the work-up.

TI  - CGG repeat length and AGG interruptions as indicators of fragile X-associated 
      diminished ovarian reserve.
PG  - 957-964
LID - 10.1038/gim.2017.220 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Fragile X premutation (PM) carriers may experience difficulties 
      conceiving a child probably due to fragile X-associated diminished ovarian 
      reserve (FXDOR). We investigated which subgroups of carriers with a PM are at 
      higher risk of FXDOR, and whether the number of AGG interruptions within the 
      repeat sequence further ameliorates the risk. METHODS: We compared markers of 
      ovarian reserve, including anti-Mullerian hormone, antral follicle count, and 
      number of oocytes retrieved between different subgroups of patients with a PM. 
      RESULTS: We found that carriers with midrange repeats size (70-90 CGG) 
      demonstrate significantly lower ovarian reserve. Additionally, the number of AGG 
      interruptions directly correlated with parameters of ovarian reserve. Patients 
      with longer uninterrupted CGG repeats post-AGG interruptions had the lowest 
      ovarian reserve. CONCLUSION: This study connects AGG interruptions and certain 
      CGG repeat length to reduced ovarian reserve in carriers with a PM. A possible 
      explanation for our findings is the proposed gonadotoxicity of the FMR1 
      transcripts. Reduction of AGG interruptions could increase the likelihood that 
      secondary RNA structures in the FMR1 messenger RNA are formed, which could cause 
      cell dysfunction within the ovaries. These findings may provide women with 
      guidance regarding their fertility potential and accordingly assist with their 
      family planning.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability 
      in humans. It is a result of CGG repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region 
      (5' UTR) of the FMR1 gene. This gene encodes the FMRP protein that is involved in 
      neuronal development. Repeat expansion leads to heterochromatinization of the 
      promoter, gene silencing, and the subsequent absence of FMRP. To date, there is 
      no specific therapy for the syndrome. All treatments in clinic practice provide 
      symptomatic therapy. The development of drug therapy for Fragile X syndrome 
      treatment is connected with the search for inhibitors of enzymes that are 
      responsible for heterochromatinization. Here, we report a weak transcriptional 
      activity of the FMR1 gene and the absence of FMRP protein after Fragile X 
      syndrome cell lines treatment with two FDA approved inhibitors of histone 
      deacetylases, romidepsin and vorinostat. We demonstrate that romidepsin, an 
      inhibitor of class I histone deacetylases, does not activate FMR1 expression in 
      patient cell cultures, whereas vorinostat, an inhibitor of classes I and II 
      histone deacetylases, activates a low level of FMR1 expression in some patient 
      cell lines.

PG  - 91-100
LID - 10.1007/s40291-017-0305-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome is caused by CGG repeat expansion mutation in the 
      FMR1 gene. Normal alleles have 5-44 CGG repeats with AGG interruptions. The 
      expanded gray zone (GZ) (45-54 repeats) and premutation (PM) (55-200 repeats) 
      alleles are often uninterrupted and are unstably inherited in subsequent 
      generations. The prevalence of PM and GZ carriers is high in the female 
      population, at 1/66 and 1/113, respectively, and PM is associated with fertility 
      problems in 20% of cases. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to molecularly 
      characterize CGG repeats and AGG interruption sequences in the FMR1 gene in women 
      of reproductive age and in women with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted molecular analysis of the FMR1 gene from 300 
      women of reproductive age and 140 women with POI using triplet primed-polymerase 
      chain reaction. This enabled us to identify carriers and to document CGG repeat 
      size and the AGG interruption pattern. RESULTS: In women of reproductive age, 
      1.7% were GZ carriers and 0.3% were PM carriers; in women with POI, 3.6% were GZ 
      carriers and 2.14% were PM carriers. The frequency of GZ and PM carriers did not 
      significantly differ between the cohorts (Fisher's exact test: p < 2.23 for GZ 
      vs. control and p < 0.101 for PM vs. control). Carriers received genetic 
      counselling; family screening identified an additional seven carriers. 
      CONCLUSION: We documented preliminary data on the prevalence of GZ and PM 
      carriers among the studied cohorts. The identification of PM carriers among women 
      with POI serves a dual purpose of recognizing a cause for ovarian dysfunction and 
      enabling genetic counselling, which will help carriers when making reproductive 
      decisions.

TI  - Reduction in the number of CGG repeats on the FMR1 gene in carriers of genetic 
      disorders versus noncarriers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: CGG repeat expansion on the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene 
      is used to diagnose fragile X syndrome. Previous studies have discussed the 
      correlation between the number of CGG repeats and its associated phenotypic 
      components. The objective of this study is to determine whether the number of CGG 
      repeats differ between carriers of genetic disorders versus noncarriers. METHODS: 
      We performed a retrospective chart review of 2867 patients who received genetic 
      screening at our fertility clinic between June 2013 and July 2015. The number of 
      CGG repeats on allele 1 and allele 2 on the FMR1 gene was collected and it was 
      specified whether the patient was a carrier or a noncarrier of a specific 
      mutation. Patients with CGG repeats greater than or equal to 45 were excluded 
      from the study. RESULTS: Carriers (n=759) had a reduced number of repeats 
      compared to noncarriers (n=2024) on allele 1 (p=.03), allele 2 (p=.02) and the 
      average of both alleles (p=.01). Additionally, the number of CGG repeats from the 
      ten most carried diseases from the cohort were used and tested individually for 
      clinical significance against the number of repeats in the noncarriers. A 
      reduction in repeats was shown in several mutations and a few were outliers. 
      CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that there is a significant reduction in the 
      number of CGG repeats in carriers of genetic mutations. A larger scale study of 
      disease carrying patients would be beneficial.

TI  - The effects of optimism, religion, and hope on mood and anxiety disorders in 
      women with the FMR1 premutation.
PG  - 916-927

AB  - BACKGROUND: The FMR1 premutation, caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      on the FMR1 gene, has been identified as a genetic risk factor for mood and 
      anxiety disorders. Building on recent studies identifying increased risk for mood 
      and affective disorders in this population, we examined effects of potential 
      protective factors (optimism, religion, hope) on depression and anxiety diagnoses 
      in a prospective, longitudinal cohort. METHODS: Eighty-three women with the FMR1 
      premutation participated in the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR 
      Disorders at two-time points, 3 years apart. Participants also completed measures 
      of optimism, religion, personal faith, hope, and child and family 
      characteristics. We used logistic regression to examine correlates of major 
      depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders at the initial assessment, as 
      well as predictors of the diagnostic course over time. RESULTS: Lower optimism 
      and higher religious participation relevant to fragile X syndrome at the initial 
      assessment were associated with a lifetime history of MDD. Lower optimism also 
      predicted the occurrence and reoccurrence of an anxiety disorder 3 years later. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In women with the FMR1 premutation, elevated optimism may reduce the 
      occurrence or severity of MDD and anxiety disorders. These findings underscore 
      the importance of supporting mental health across the FMR1 spectrum of 
      involvement.

TI  - Fragile X Mental Retardation-1 Knockout Zebrafish Shows Precocious Development in 
      Social Behavior.
PG  - 438-443
LID - 10.1089/zeb.2017.1446 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a generally hereditary form of human mental 
      retardation that is caused by triplet repeat expansion (CGG) mutation in fragile 
      X mental retardation 1 (fmr1) gene promoter and that results in the absence of 
      the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression. The common symptoms 
      of FXS patients include learning disabilities, anxiety, autistic behaviors, as 
      well as other behavioral abnormalities. Our previous results demonstrated the 
      behavioral abnormalities in fmr1 knockout (KO) zebrafish such as fear memory 
      impairment and autism-like behavior. Here, we studied the functional role of fmr1 
      gene on the development of social behavior by behavioral experiments, including 
      shoaling behavior, shoaling preference, light/dark test, and novel tank task. Our 
      results demonstrated that precocious development of shoaling behavior is found in 
      fmr1 KO zebrafish without affecting the shoaling preference on conspecific 
      zebrafish. The shoaling behavior appeared after 14 days postfertilization (dpf), 
      and the level of shoaling elevated in fmr1 KO zebrafish. Furthermore, the fmr1 KO 
      zebrafish at 28 dpf expressed higher anxiety level in novel tank task. These 
      results suggest that the change of shoaling behavior in fmr1 KO zebrafish may 
      result from hyperactivity and an increase of anxiety.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual 
      disability (ID) and autism. In most of cases, the molecular basis of this 
      syndrome is a CGG repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 
      gene. It is inherited as an X linked dominant trait, with a reduced penetrance 
      (80% for males and 30% for females). Full mutation (FM) expansion from premutated 
      alleles (PM) is only acquired via maternal meiosis, while paternal transmission 
      always remains in the PM range. We present a 16-year-old girl with a mild fragile 
      X syndrome phenotype. FMR1 gene study showed that the patient inherited a mosaic 
      premutation-full mutation with an unmethylated uninterrupted allele (175, >200 
      CGG) from her father. The father showed an 88 CGG uninterrupted unmethylated 
      allele in blood and sperm cells. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a 
      FMR1 mosaic premutation-full mutation allele inherited from a PM father. In our 
      opinion, the most likely explanation could be a postzygotic somatic expansion. We 
      can conclude that in rare cases of a child with a full mutation whose mother does 
      not carry a premutation, the possibility of paternal transmission should be 
      considered.

TI  - Distribution of FMR1 and FMR2 Repeats in Argentinean Patients with Primary 
      Ovarian Insufficiency.
LID - 10.3390/genes8080194 [doi]
LID - 194
AB  - The premutation state of FMR1 (Fragile X Mental Retardation 1) has been 
      associated with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), and is the most common known 
      genetic cause for 46,XX patients. Nevertheless, very few studies have analyzed 
      its frequency in Latin American populations. Additionally, a relationship between 
      alleles carrying a cryptic microdeletion in the 5'UTR of FMR2 and the onset of 
      POI has only been studied in one population. Our aim was to analyze the incidence 
      of FMR1 premutations and putative microdeletions in exon 1 of FMR2 in a cohort of 
      Argentinean women with POI. We studied 133 patients and 84 controls. Fluorescent 
      PCR was performed, and the FMR2 exon 1 was further sequenced in samples 
      presenting less than 11 repeats. We found the frequency of FMR1 premutations to 
      be 6.7% and 2.9% for familial and sporadic patients, respectively. Among 
      controls, 1/84 women presented a premutation. In addition, although we did not 
      find microdeletions in FMR2, we observed a change (T >C) adjacent to the repeats 
      in two sisters with POI. Given the repetitive nature of the sequence involved, we 
      could not ascertain whether this represents a single nucleotide polymorphism 
      (SNP) or a deletion. Therefore, a relationship between FMR2 and POI could not be 
      established for our population.

TI  - Prevalence of Fragile X Syndrome among children receiving special education and 
      carrier states in first degree relatives.
PG  - 92-96
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetically determined developmental 
      disorder. Underlying genotype is cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeat expansions 
      with over 200 repeats in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Children 
      with FXS are most accessible in special education institutions in Sri Lanka, with 
      a total of approximately 6000 registered attendees. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the 
      current study was to estimate the prevalence of FXS among special school 
      attendees and to screen first degree relatives of affected children. METHODS: A 
      nationally representative sample of 850 children (5-18 years) was selected using 
      multi-level stratified sampling. Screening was performed by 3' direct triplet 
      primed PCR, followed by melting curve analysis. Expanded repeat status of the 
      screened positives were confirmed using capillary electrophoresis, methylation 
      specific PCR and Southern hybridization. Screening of available first degree 
      relatives (n=12) were carried out using the same method of screening and 
      diagnosis. RESULTS: Eleven had FXS. Prevalence of FXS was 1.3% (95% CI 0.9-1.6). 
      Among the 11 with FXS 9 had more than 350 CGG repeats, while the rest had around 
      300. Twelve first degree relatives consisting of nine mothers, two female 
      siblings and a male sibling were tested. All mothers and female siblings had 
      either full mutation or premutation while the male sibling had CGG repeats in the 
      normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Among the special school attendees, prevalence of FXS 
      was 1.3% which has a high risk for autism and attention deficit hyperactivity 
      disorder.

TI  - Metformin ameliorates core deficits in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 674-677
LID - 10.1038/nm.4335 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum 
      disorders (ASD). Trinucleotide repeat expansions in FMR1 abolish FMRP expression, 
      leading to hyperactivation of ERK and mTOR signaling upstream of mRNA 
      translation. Here we show that metformin, the most widely used drug for type 2 
      diabetes, rescues core phenotypes in Fmr1(-/y) mice and selectively normalizes 
      ERK signaling, eIF4E phosphorylation and the expression of MMP-9. Thus, metformin 
      is a potential FXS therapeutic.

TI  - Association of skewed X-chromosome inactivation with FMR1 CGG repeat length and 
      anti-Mullerian hormone levels: a cohort study.
PG  - 34

LID - 34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Premutation range CGGn repeats of the FMR1 gene denote risk toward 
      primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), also called premature ovarian failure (POF). 
      This prospective cohort study was undertaken to determine if X-chromosome 
      inactivation skew (sXCI) is associated with variations in FMR1 CGG repeat length 
      and, if so, is also associated with age adjusted antimullerian hormone (AMH) 
      levels as an indicator of functional ovarian reserve (FOR). METHODS: DNA samples 
      of 58 women were analyzed for methylation status and confirmation of CGG(n) 
      repeat length. Based on previously described FMR1 genotypes, there were 18 women 
      with norm FMR1 (both alleles in range of CGG (n=26-34)), and 40 women who had at 
      least one allele at CGG(n<26) or CGG(>34 () not-norm FMR1). As part of a routine 
      evaluation of ovarian reserve, patients at our fertility center have their serum 
      AMH assessed at first visit. Regression models were used to test the association 
      of ovarian reserve, as indicated by serum AMH, with sXCI. RESULTS: sXCI was 
      significantly lower among infertility patients with norm FMR1 (6.5 +/- 11.1, median 
      and IQR) compared to those with not-norm FMR1 (12.0 +/- 14.6, P = 0.005), though 
      among young oocyte donors the opposite effect was observed. Women age >30 to 
      38 years old demonstrated greater ovarian reserve in the presence of lower sXCI 
      as evidenced by significantly higher AMH levels (GLM sXCI_10%, f = 11.27; 
      P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Together these findings suggest that FMR1 CGG repeat 
      length may have a role in determining X-chromosome inactivation which could 
      represent a possible mechanism for previously observed association of low age 
      adjusted ovarian reserve with FMR1 variations in repeat length. Further, larger, 
      investigations will be required to test this hypothesis.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder typically affecting male premutation carriers with 
      55-200 CGG trinucleotide repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene after age 50. The aim 
      of this study was to examine whether cerebellar and brainstem changes emerge 
      during development or aging in late life. We retrospectively analyzed magnetic 
      resonance imaging scans from 322 males (age 8-81 years). Volume changes in the 
      cerebellum and brainstem were contrasted with those in the ventricles and whole 
      brain. Compared to the controls, premutation carriers without FXTAS showed 
      significantly accelerated volume decrease in the cerebellum and whole brain, 
      flatter inverted U-shaped trajectory of the brainstem, and larger ventricles. 
      Compared to both older controls and premutation carriers without FXTAS, carriers 
      with FXTAS exhibited significant volume decrease in the cerebellum and whole 
      brain and accelerated volume decrease in the brainstem. We therefore conclude 
      that cerebellar and brainstem volumes were likely affected during both 
      development and progression of neurodegeneration in premutation carriers, 
      suggesting that interventions may need to start early in adulthood to be most 
      effective.

TI  - Selective rescue of heightened anxiety but not gait ataxia in a premutation 90CGG 
      mouse model of Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome.

AB  - A CGG-repeat expansion in the premutation range in the Fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 gene (FMR1) has been identified as the genetic cause of Fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late-onset neurodegenerative 
      disorder that manifests with action tremor, gait ataxia and cognitive 
      impairments. In this study, we used a bigenic mouse model, in which expression of 
      a 90CGG premutation tract is activated in neural cells upon doxycycline 
      administration-P90CGG mouse model. We, here, demonstrate the behavioural 
      manifestation of clinically relevant features of FXTAS patients and premutation 
      carrier individuals in this inducible mouse model. P90CGG mice display heightened 
      anxiety, deficits in motor coordination and impaired gait and represent the first 
      FXTAS model that exhibits an ataxia phenotype as observed in patients. The 
      behavioural phenotype is accompanied by the formation of 
      ubiquitin/FMRpolyglycine-positive intranuclear inclusions, as another hallmark of 
      FXTAS, in the cerebellum, hippocampus and amygdala. Strikingly, upon cessation of 
      transgene induction the anxiety phenotype of mice recovers along with a reduction 
      of intranuclear inclusions in dentate gyrus and amygdala. In contrast, motor 
      function deteriorates further and no reduction in intranuclear inclusions can be 
      observed in the cerebellum. Our data thus demonstrate that expression of a 90CGG 
      premutation expansion outside of the FMR1 context is sufficient to evoke an 
      FXTAS-like behavioural phenotype. Brain region-specific neuropathology and 
      (partial) behavioural reversibility make the inducible P90CGG a valuable mouse 
      model for testing pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic intervention methods.

      the FastFraXTM FMR1 Sizing kit, as a test in quantifying the number of CGG 
      repeats in the FMR1 gene. Based on testing with well characterized DNA samples 
      from Coriell, the kit yielded size results within 3 repeats of those obtained by 
      common consensus (n = 14), with the exception of one allele. Furthermore, based 
      on data obtained using all Coriell samples with or without common consensus (n = 
      29), the Sizing kit was 97.5% in agreement with existing approaches. 
      Additionally, the kit generated consistent size information in repeatability and 
      reproducibility studies (CV 0.39% to 3.42%). Clinical performance was established 
      with 198 archived clinical samples, yielding results of 100% sensitivity (95% CI, 
      91.03% to 100%) and 100% specificity (95% CI, 97.64% to 100%) in categorizing 
      patient samples into the respective normal, intermediate, premutation and full 
      mutation genotypes.

TI  - Iron accumulation and dysregulation in the putamen in fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome.
PG  - 585-591
LID - 10.1002/mds.26902 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome is an adult-onset 
      disorder associated with premutation alleles of the FMR1 gene. This disorder is 
      characterized by progressive action tremor, gait ataxia, and cognitive decline. 
      Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome pathology includes dystrophic white 
      matter and intranuclear inclusions in neurons and astrocytes. We previously 
      demonstrated that the transport of iron into the brain is altered in fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome; therefore, we also expect an alteration of 
      iron metabolism in brain areas related to motor control. Iron is essential for 
      cell metabolism, but uncomplexed iron leads to oxidative stress and contributes 
      to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated a potential 
      iron modification in the putamen - a structure that participates in motor 
      learning and performance - in fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. 
      METHODS: We used samples of putamen obtained from 9 fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome and 9 control cases to study iron localization using 
      Perl's method, and iron-binding proteins using immunostaining. RESULTS: We found 
      increased iron deposition in neuronal and glial cells in the putamen in fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. We also found a generalized decrease in the 
      amount of the iron-binding proteins transferrin and ceruloplasmin, and decreased 
      number of neurons and glial cells that contained ceruloplasmin. However, we found 
      increased levels of iron, transferrin, and ceruloplasmin in microglial cells, 
      indicating an attempt by the immune system to remove the excess iron. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Overall, found a deficit in proteins that eliminate extra iron from 
      the cells with a concomitant increase in the deposit of cellular iron in the 
      putamen in Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. (c) 2017 International

AB  - Molecular genetic testing for fragile X (FX) is complicated due to the large 
      variation in the size of CGG expansion. The aim of this study was to apply this 
      new technique using AmplideX FMR1 PCR assay, which is considered a better 
      diagnostic tool for detecting expanded alleles in Indian population. The primary 
      objective was to identify the carrier status of females and to correlate the 
      instability of premutation alleles in females with the repeat sizes. 24 children 
      with FX based on rapid PCR and 29 female relatives of these patients were 
      included. Out of the 29 females screened, those whose child (or children) was 
      affected by FX, were all premutation carriers confirming their role in 
      transmission. The smallest PM allele that expanded into FM in the next generation 
      was 78 repeats and the smallest PM allele detected was 63 repeats, and when 
      transmitted from mother to offspring remained in the premutation range. In 4 
      families, the repeat size of the allele reduced from PM to normal repeat numbers 
      in their daughters and in 1 case to borderline PM range. Thus, apart from the 
      reduced turnaround time, this PCR based assay offers advantage by its sensitivity 
      to detect CGG repeats in the intermediate region and lower range of premutation 
      alleles. It also provides added information of AGG interruptions, which may have 
      an impact on the counseling of women with intermediate and PM alleles.

LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2016.204 [doi]
AB  - Fragile-X syndrome (FXS) is a frequent genetic form of intellectual disability 
      (ID). The main recurrent mutagenic mechanism causing FXS is the expansion of a 
      CGG repeat sequence in the 5'-UTR of the FMR1 gene, therefore, routinely tested 
      in ID patients. We report here three FMR1 intragenic pathogenic variants not 
      affecting this sequence, identified using high-throughput sequencing (HTS): a 
      previously reported hemizygous deletion encompassing the last exon of FMR1, too 
      small to be detected by array-CGH and inducing decreased expression of a 
      truncated form of FMRP protein, in three brothers with ID (family 1) and two 
      splice variants in boys with sporadic ID: a de novo variant c.990+1G>A (family 2) 
      and a maternally inherited c.420-8A>G variant (family 3). After clinical 
      reevaluation, the five patients presented features consistent with FXS (mean 
      Hagerman's scores=15). We conducted a systematic review of all rare 
      non-synonymous variants previously reported in FMR1 in ID patients and showed 
      that six of them are convincing pathogenic variants. This study suggests that 
      intragenic FMR1 variants, although much less frequent than CGG expansions, are a 
      significant mutational mechanism leading to FXS and demonstrates the interest of 
      HTS approaches to detect them in ID patients with a negative standard work-up.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from a repeat expansion mutation near the FMR1 
      gene promoter and is the most common form of heritable intellectual disability 
      and autism. Full mutations larger than 200 CGG repeats trigger FMR1 
      heterochromatinization and loss of gene expression, which is primarily 
      responsible for the pathological features of FXS . In contrast, smaller 
      pre-mutations of 55-200 CGG are associated with FMR1 overexpression and Fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late-onset neurodegenerative 
      condition. While the role of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in FMR1 gene silencing has 
      been studied extensively, the role of 5-hydroxymethylation (5hmC), a newly 
      discovered epigenetic mark produced through active DNA demethylation, has not 
      been previously investigated in FXS neurons. Here, we used two complementary 
      epigenetic assays, 5hmC sensitive restriction digest and ten-eleven 
      translocation-assisted bisulfite pyrosequencing, to quantify FMR1 5mC and 5hmC 
      levels. We observed increased levels of 5hmC at the FMR1 promoter in FXS patient 
      brains with full-mutations relative to pre-mutation carriers and unaffected 
      controls. In addition, we found that 5hmC enrichment at the FMR1 locus in FXS 
      cells is specific to neurons by utilizing a nuclei sorting technique to separate 
      neuronal and glial DNA fractions from post-mortem brain tissues. This FMR1 5hmC 
      enrichment was not present in cellular models of FXS including fibroblasts, 
      lymphocytes and reprogrammed neurons, indicating they do not fully recapitulate 
      this epigenetic feature of disease. Future studies could investigate the 
      potential to leverage this epigenetic pathway to restore FMR1 expression and 
      discern whether levels of 5hmC correlate with phenotypic severity.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a limited expansion of CGG repeats in the 5' UTR of FMR1. Two 
      mechanisms are proposed to cause FXTAS: RNA gain-of-function, where CGG RNA 
      sequesters specific proteins, and translation of CGG repeats into a 
      polyglycine-containing protein, FMRpolyG. Here we developed transgenic mice 
      expressing CGG repeat RNA with or without FMRpolyG. Expression of FMRpolyG is 
      pathogenic, while the sole expression of CGG RNA is not. FMRpolyG interacts with 
      the nuclear lamina protein LAP2beta and disorganizes the nuclear lamina architecture 
      in neurons differentiated from FXTAS iPS cells. Finally, expression of LAP2beta 
      rescues neuronal death induced by FMRpolyG. Overall, these results suggest that 
      translation of expanded CGG repeats into FMRpolyG alters nuclear lamina 
      architecture and drives pathogenesis in FXTAS.

AB  - CGG repeats in the 5'UTR of Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) RNA mediate RNA 
      localization and translation in granules. Large expansions of CGG repeats (> 200 
      repeats) in FMR1, referred to as full mutations, are associated with fragile X 
      syndrome (FXS). Smaller expansions (55-200 repeats), referred to as premutations, 
      are associated with fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and fragile X 
      premature ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). TMPyP4 is a porphyrin ring compound that 
      destabilizes CGG repeat RNA secondary structure. Here we show that exogenous CGG 
      repeat RNA by itself, lacking the FMRP ORF, microinjected into hippocampal 
      neurons is localized in RNA granules and inhibits translation of ARC RNA, which 
      is localized in the same granules. TMPyP4 rescues translation of ARC RNA in 
      granules. We also show that in human premutation fibroblasts with endogenous CGG 
      repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene, translation of ARC RNA is inhibited and 
      calcium homeostasis is disrupted and both phenotypes are rescued by TMPyP4. 
      Inhibition of granule translation by expanded CGG repeats and rescue of granule 
      translation by TMPy4, represent potential pathogenic mechanism and therapeutic 
      strategy, respectively, for FXTAS and FXPOI.

TI  - Detecting AGG Interruptions in Male and Female FMR1 Premutation Carriers by 
      Single-Molecule Sequencing.
PG  - 324-331

AB  - The FMR1 gene contains an unstable CGG repeat in its 5' untranslated region. 
      Premutation alleles range between 55 and 200 repeat units and confer a risk for 
      developing fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome or fragile X-associated 
      primary ovarian insufficiency. Furthermore, the premutation allele often expands 
      to a full mutation during female germline transmission giving rise to the fragile 
      X syndrome. The risk for a premutation to expand depends mainly on the number of 
      CGG units and the presence of AGG interruptions in the CGG repeat. Unfortunately, 
      the detection of AGG interruptions is hampered by technical difficulties. Here, 
      we demonstrate that single-molecule sequencing enables the determination of not 
      only the repeat size, but also the complete repeat sequence including AGG 
      interruptions in male and female alleles with repeats ranging from 45 to 100 CGG 
      units. We envision this method will facilitate research and diagnostic analysis 
      of the FMR1 repeat expansion.

AB  - With widespread adoption of fragile X carrier screening in pregnant women, the 
      number of expectant couples receiving news of an unanticipated Fragile X Mental 
      Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene expansion has increased. The most common abnormal 
      result from maternal FMR1 testing involves an intermediate allele, also known as 
      a gray zone result, which requires genetic counseling but poses minimal risk for 
      an adverse developmental outcome. By contrast, the finding of a maternal FMR1 
      premutation or full mutation during pregnancy has important implications for the 
      woman herself, her unborn child, and her extended family. These multiple levels 
      of impact, in addition to the complex inheritance pattern and variable 
      expressivity of fragile X-associated disorders, cause significant stress for 
      newly identified expectant couples and pose unique challenges for genetic 
      counselors in the prenatal setting. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Molecular screening of intellectually disabled patients and those with premature 
      ovarian failure for CGG repeat expansion at FMR1 locus: Implication of combined 
      triplet repeat primed polymerase chain reaction and methylation-specific 
      polymerase chain reaction analysis.
PG  - 1175-1179
LID - 10.4103/0028-3886.193786 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is also a leading cause of intellectual 
      disability along with Down's syndrome. It is caused by the expansion of CGG 
      triplet repeat at 5' untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 
      (FMR1) gene. Since the prevalence rate is quite high in the general population, 
      molecular diagnosis is important to establish the cause and the prenatal 
      diagnosis. At present, there are a number of methods available with their own 
      merits and demerits. AIM AND METHODS: Molecular screening of intellectually 
      disabled patients and those with premature ovarian failure with combined triplet 
      repeat primed polymerase chain reaction (TP-PCR) and methylation-specific 
      polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) for establishing the diagnosis of FXS. 
      RESULTS: The specificity of the method has been validated with archived 
      previously genotyped samples, facilitating the application of this method in the 
      screening procedure. The combined TP-PCR and MS-PCR approach identified six (10%) 
      of the intellectually disabled cases as full mutation positive, one (4%) of the 
      premature ovarian failure cases as premutation positive, and one (out of two) of 
      the prenatal samples as premutation positive. CONCLUSION: The present study 
      concludes that a combined usage of TP-PCR and MS-PCR will be a useful alternative 
      approach to diagnose patients suffering from fragile X syndrome.

TI  - CGG Repeat-Induced FMR1 Silencing Depends on the Expansion Size in Human iPSCs 
      and Neurons Carrying Unmethylated Full Mutations.

AB  - In fragile X syndrome (FXS), CGG repeat expansion greater than 200 triplets is 
      believed to trigger FMR1 gene silencing and disease etiology. However, FXS 
      siblings have been identified with more than 200 CGGs, termed unmethylated full 
      mutation (UFM) carriers, without gene silencing and disease symptoms. Here, we 
      show that hypomethylation of the FMR1 promoter is maintained in induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from two UFM individuals. However, a 
      subset of iPSC clones with large CGG expansions carries silenced FMR1. 
      Furthermore, we demonstrate de novo silencing upon expansion of the CGG repeat 
      size. FMR1 does not undergo silencing during neuronal differentiation of UFM 
      iPSCs, and expression of large unmethylated CGG repeats has phenotypic 
      consequences resulting in neurodegenerative features. Our data suggest that UFM 
      individuals do not lack the cell-intrinsic ability to silence FMR1 and that 
      inter-individual variability in the CGG repeat size required for silencing exists 
      in the FXS population.

TI  - Developmental profiles of infants with an FMR1 premutation.
PG  - 40
LID - 40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of FMR1 premutation carriers 
      is at an increased risk for cognitive, emotional, and medical conditions. 
      However, because the premutation is rarely diagnosed at birth, the early 
      developmental trajectories of children with a premutation are not known. METHODS: 
      This exploratory study examined the cognitive, communication, and 
      social-behavioral profiles of 26 infants with a premutation who were identified 
      through participation in a newborn screening for fragile X syndrome pilot study. 
      In this study, families whose newborn screened positive for an FMR1 premutation 
      were invited to participate in a longitudinal study of early development. 
      Twenty-six infants with the premutation and 21 matched, screen-negative 
      comparison babies were assessed using validated standardized measures at 6-month 
      intervals starting as young as 3 months of age. The babies were assessed up to 
      seven times over a 4-year period. RESULTS: The premutation group was not 
      statistically different from the comparison group on measures of cognitive 
      development, adaptive behavior, temperament, or overall communication. However, 
      the babies with the premutation had a significantly different developmental 
      trajectory on measures of nonverbal communication and hyperresponsivity to 
      sensory experiences. They also were significantly more hyporesponsive at all ages 
      than the comparison group. Cytosine-guanine-guanine repeat length was linearly 
      associated with overall cognitive development. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest 
      that infants with a premutation may present with subtle developmental differences 
      as young as 12 months of age that may be early markers of later anxiety, social 
      deficits, or other challenges thought to be experienced by a subset of carriers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study whether reported, but inconsistent, associations between the 
      FMR1 CGG repeat lengths in the intermediate, high normal, or low normal range 
      differentiate women diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) from 
      population controls and whether associations vary by race/ethnic group. DESIGN: 
      Case-control study. SETTING: Academic and private fertility clinics. PATIENT(S): 
      DOR cases (n = 129; 95 Whites, 22 Asian, 12 other) from five U.S. fertility 
      clinics were clinically diagnosed, with regular menses and no fragile X syndrome 
      family history. Normal fertility controls (n = 803; 386 Whites, 219 
      African-Americans, 102 Japanese, 96 Chinese) from the United States-based SWAN 
      Study had one or more menstrual period in the 3 months pre-enrollment, one or 
      more pregnancy, no history of infertility or hormone therapy, and menopause 
      >/=46 years. Previously, the SWAN Chinese and Japanese groups had similar FMR1 CGG 
      repeat lengths, thus they were combined. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE(S): FMR1 CGG repeat lengths. RESULT(S): Median CGG repeats were nearly 
      identical by case/control group. DOR cases had fewer CGG repeats in the shorter 
      FMR1 allele than controls among Whites, but this was not significant among 
      Asians. White cases had fewer CGG repeats in the shorter allele than Asian cases. 
      No significant differences were found in the high normal/intermediate range 
      between cases and controls or by race/ethnic group within cases in the longer 
      allele. CONCLUSION(S): This study refutes prior reports of an association between 
      DOR and high normal/intermediate repeats and confirms an association between DOR 
      and low normal repeats in Whites.

TI  - Contraction of fully expanded FMR1 alleles to the normal range: predisposing 
      haplotype or rare events?
PG  - 269-275
LID - 10.1038/jhg.2016.122 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of inherited intellectual 
      disability, is due to the expansion over 200 CGGs and methylation of this 
      polymorphic region, in the 5'-UTR (untranslated region) of FMR1 (Xq27.3). We have 
      identified four FXS mosaic males: M1-(CGG)(35)/(CGG)(>200); 
      M2-(CGG)(26)/(CGG)(>200); M3-(CGG)(39)/(CGG)(>200); and 
      M4-(CGG)(18)/(CGG)(125)/(CGG)(>200). After genotyping their respective mothers, 
      we suggested that normal alleles of these patients resulted from post-zygotic 
      contractions of full expansions. The detection of these four rare independent 
      cases led us to hypothesize the existence of a large-contraction predisposing 
      haplotype in our population. Next, we questioned whether other normal pure CGGs 
      would have arisen through similar contractions from fully expanded alleles. To 
      address these questions, we identified stable single-nucleotide polymorphism 
      (SNP) lineages and related short tandem repeat (STR) haplotypes 
      (DXS998-DXS548-FRAXAC1-FRAXAC2) of the four mosaics, 123 unrelated FXS patients 
      and 212 controls. An extended flanking haplotype (34-44-38-336) shared by mosaics 
      from lineage A suggested a risk lineage-specific haplotype more prone to large 
      contractions. Other normal pure FMR1 alleles from this SNP background also shared 
      phylogenetically close STR haplotypes, although a single (CGG)(exp)>(CGG)(24) 
      contraction or the loss of AGG interruptions may explain their origin. In both 
      scenarios, multistep FMR1 mutations involving the gain or loss of several CGGs 
      seem to underlie the evolution of the repeat.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that FMR1 expansions would result in global 
      gene dysregulation as early as the second trimester of human fetal development. 
      METHOD: Using cell-free fetal RNA obtained from amniotic fluid supernatant and 
      expression microarrays, we compared RNA levels in samples from fetuses with 
      premutation or full mutation allele expansions with control samples. RESULTS: We 
      found clear signals of differential gene expression relating to a variety of 
      cellular functions, including ubiquitination, mitochondrial function, and 
      neuronal/synaptic architecture. Additionally, among the genes showing 
      differential gene expression, we saw links to related diseases of intellectual 
      disability and motor function. Finally, within the unique molecular phenotypes 
      established for each mutation set, we saw clear signatures of mitochondrial 
      dysfunction and disrupted neurological function. Patterns of differential gene 
      expression were very different in male and female fetuses with premutation 
      alleles. CONCLUSION: These results support a model for which genetic 
      misregulation during fetal development may set the stage for late clinical 
      manifestations of FMR1-related disorders. (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common cause of intellectual disability that is 
      most often due to a CGG-repeat expansion mutation in the FMR1 gene that triggers 
      epigenetic gene silencing. Epigenetic modifying drugs can only transiently and 
      modestly induce FMR1 reactivation in the presence of the elongated CGG repeat. As 
      a proof-of-principle, we excised the expanded CGG-repeat in both somatic cell 
      hybrids containing the human fragile X chromosome and human FXS iPS cells using 
      the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. We observed transcriptional reactivation in 
      approximately 67% of the CRISPR cut hybrid colonies and in 20% of isolated human 
      FXS iPSC colonies. The reactivated cells produced FMRP and exhibited a decline in 
      DNA methylation at the FMR1 locus. These data demonstrate the excision of the 
      expanded CGG-repeat from the fragile X chromosome can result in FMR1 
      reactivation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation drives production of toxic 
      proteins from pathogenic repeat sequences in multiple untreatable 
      neurodegenerative disorders. Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) 
      is one such condition, resulting from a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 
      5' leader sequence of the FMR1 gene. RAN proteins from the CGG repeat accumulate 
      in ubiquitinated inclusions in FXTAS patient brains and elicit toxicity. In 
      addition to the CGG repeat, an antisense mRNA containing a CCG repeat is also 
      transcribed from the FMR1 locus. We evaluated whether this antisense CCG repeat 
      supports RAN translation and contributes to pathology in FXTAS patients. METHODS: 
      We generated a series of CCG RAN translation-specific reporters and utilized them 
      to measure RAN translation from CCG repeats in multiple reading frames in 
      transfected cells. We also developed antibodies against predicted CCG RAN 
      proteins and used immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence on FXTAS patient 
      tissues to measure their accumulation and distribution. RESULTS: RAN translation 
      from CCG repeats is supported in all 3 potential reading frames, generating 
      polyproline, polyarginine, and polyalanine proteins, respectively. Their 
      production occurs whether or not the natural AUG start upstream of the repeat in 
      the proline reading frame is present. All 3 frames show greater translation at 
      larger repeat sizes. Antibodies targeted to the antisense FMR polyproline and 
      polyalanine proteins selectively stain nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates in 
      FXTAS patients and colocalize with ubiquitinated neuronal inclusions. 
      INTERPRETATION: RAN translation from antisense CCG repeats generates novel 
      proteins that accumulate in ubiquitinated inclusions in FXTAS patients. Ann 
      Neurol 2016;80:871-881.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of inherited intellectual 
      disability. The most common etiology of the syndrome is expansion and methylation 
      of a CGG trinucleotide at chromosome region Xq27.3 involving FMR1 (fragile X 
      mental retardation 1 gene). This disorder is commonly underdiagnosed in children 
      and adolescents, given the high clinical variability. In Brazil, molecular 
      diagnosis of FXS by CE does not exist in the public health system. The current 
      standard for separation and identification of DNA fragment sizes is 50 cm CE, 
      which is uncommon in public genotyping laboratories. This study describes the 
      standardization of 36 cm CE for fragment analysis of samples from patients with 
      intellectual disability suggestive of FXS. Genomic dsDNA was isolated from 
      patients and amplified by PCR using the FMR1 AmplideX((R)) Kit. It was then 
      possible to detect changes in repeat length of FMR1, such as full mutation and 
      premutation. Thus, the proposed standardization proved to be effective for the 
      diagnosis of FXS, permitting suitable genetic counseling for families. Inclusion 
      of molecular testing such as this in the Brazilian public health service bridges 
      the gap between available technologies and effective diagnosis, universalizing 
      access to genetic testing in central Brazil.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common inherited form of intellectual disability 
      caused by the absence or reduction of the fragile X mental retardation protein 
      (FMRP) encoded by the FMR1 gene. In humans, one symptom of FXS is 
      hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli, including touch. We used a mouse model of 
      FXS (Fmr1 KO) to study sensory processing of tactile information conveyed via the 
      whisker system. In vivo electrophysiological recordings in somatosensory barrel 
      cortex showed layer-specific broadening of the receptive fields at the level of 
      layer 2/3 but not layer 4, in response to whisker stimulation. Furthermore, the 
      encoding of tactile stimuli at different frequencies was severely affected in 
      layer 2/3. The behavioral effect of this broadening of the receptive fields was 
      tested in the gap-crossing task, a whisker-dependent behavioral paradigm. In this 
      task the Fmr1 KO mice showed differences in the number of whisker contacts with 
      platforms, decrease in the whisker sampling duration and reduction in the whisker 
      touch-time while performing the task. We propose that the increased excitability 
      in the somatosensory barrel cortex upon whisker stimulation may contribute to 
      changes in the whisking strategy as well as to other observed behavioral 
      phenotypes related to tactile processing in Fmr1 KO mice.

TI  - CGG-repeat dynamics and FMR1 gene silencing in fragile X syndrome stem cells and 
      stem cell-derived neurons.
PG  - 42
LID - 42
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a common cause of intellectual disability 
      and autism, results from the expansion of a CGG-repeat tract in the 5' 
      untranslated region of the FMR1 gene to >200 repeats. Such expanded alleles, 
      known as full mutation (FM) alleles, are epigenetically silenced in 
      differentiated cells thus resulting in the loss of FMRP, a protein important for 
      learning and memory. The timing of repeat expansion and FMR1 gene silencing is 
      controversial. METHODS: We monitored the repeat size and methylation status of 
      FMR1 alleles with expanded CGG repeats in patient-derived induced pluripotent 
      stem cells (iPSCs) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that were grown for extended 
      period of time either as stem cells or differentiated into neurons. We used a PCR 
      assay optimized for the amplification of large CGG repeats for sizing, and a 
      quantitative methylation-specific PCR for the analysis of FMR1 promoter 
      methylation. The FMR1 mRNA levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR. FMRP levels were 
      determined by western blotting and immunofluorescence. Chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation was used to study the association of repressive histone marks 
      with the FMR1 gene in FXS ESCs. RESULTS: We show here that while FMR1 gene 
      silencing can be seen in FXS embryonic stem cells (ESCs), some silenced alleles 
      contract and when the repeat number drops below ~400, DNA methylation erodes, 
      even when the repeat number remains >200. The resultant active alleles do not 
      show the large step-wise expansions seen in stem cells from other repeat 
      expansion diseases. Furthermore, there may be selection against large active 
      alleles and these alleles do not expand further or become silenced on neuronal 
      differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypotheses that (i) large 
      expansions occur prezygotically or in the very early embryo, (ii) large 
      unmethylated alleles may be deleterious in stem cells, (iii) methylation can 
      occur on alleles with >400 repeats very early in embryogenesis, and (iv) 
      expansion and contraction may occur by different mechanisms. Our data also 
      suggest that the threshold for stable methylation of FM alleles may be higher 
      than previously thought. A higher threshold might explain why some carriers of FM 
      alleles escape methylation. It may also provide a simple explanation for why 
      silencing has not been observed in mouse models with >200 repeats.

TI  - Most Martin-Bell syndrome (FMR1-related disorder) Venezuelan patients did not 
      show CGG expansion but instead display genetic heterogeneity.
PG  - 235-241
LID - 10.1038/jhg.2016.114 [doi]
AB  - Martin-Bell syndrome is mainly caused by the expansion of CGG trinucleotide 
      repeats (>200 CGG) in the first exon of the FMR1 gene, leading to 
      hypermethylation of the promoter region and silencing of the FMR1 protein 
      expression. These changes are responsible for a phenotype with varying degrees of 
      mental retardation, a long face with large and protruding ears, macroorchidism 
      and autistic behavior. There may also be, however, patients who exhibit typical 
      features of the syndrome without any expansion in the FMR1 gene; thus, other 
      mechanisms affecting the expression of the FMR1 gene were assessed in 25 out of 
      29 ascertained patients with the typical phenotype without full mutation. 
      Promoter methylation status of FMR1, mutations in its sequence and copy number 
      variations (CNVs) in genes associated with intellectual disability were 
      investigated. In 25 independent male patients without expansion, the promoter 
      region was unmethylated; one patient with a full mutation showed methylation 
      mosaicism; and a female patient had 81.2% of CpG sites methylated and 18.8% 
      hemimethylated. One heterozygous duplication in exon 6 of the PDCD6 gene 
      (programmed cell death 6) and a heterozygous deletion in exon 5 of the CHL1 gene 
      (cell adhesion molecule L1), respectively, were found in two independent 
      patients.

TI  - Partially methylated alleles, microdeletion, and tissue mosaicism in a fragile X 
      male with tremor and ataxia at 30 years of age: A case report.
PG  - 3327-3332
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.37954 [doi]
AB  - CGG repeat expansion >200 within FMR1, termed full mutation (FM), has been 
      associated with promoter methylation, consequent silencing of gene expression and 
      fragile X syndrome (FXS)-a common cause of intellectual disability and co-morbid 
      autism. Unmethylated premutation (55-199 repeats) and FM alleles have been 
      associated with fragile X related tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a late onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder. Here we present a 33-year-old male with FXS, with 
      white matter changes and progressive deterioration in gait with cerebellar signs 
      consistent with probable FXTAS; there was no evidence of any other cerebellar 
      pathology. We show that he has tissue mosaicism in blood, saliva, and buccal 
      samples for the size and methylation of his expanded alleles and a de novo, 
      unmethylated microdeletion. This microdeletion involves a  approximately 80 bp sequence in the 
      FMR1 promoter as well as complete loss of the CGG repeat in a proportion of 
      cells. Despite FMR1 mRNA levels in blood within the normal range, the methylation 
      and CGG sizing results are consistent with the diagnosis of concurrent FXS and 
      probable FXTAS. The demonstrated presence of unmethylated FM alleles would 
      explain the manifestation of milder than expected cognitive and behavioral 
      impairments and early onset of cerebellar ataxia. Our case suggests that 
      individuals with FXS, who manifest symptoms of FXTAS, may benefit from more 
      detailed laboratory testing. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Male carriers of an expansion of CGG alleles (with 55-200 CGG repeats) in the 
      FMR1 gene are affected with Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). 
      On the other hand, individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) or Parkinsonism 
      spectrum disorders may have some clinical features that overlap with FXTAS. To 
      investigate the possible association between PD and FMR1 expanded alleles, we 
      screened a total of 154 male PD patients and 190 gender- and age-matched healthy 
      control subjects from Iran. Eleven intermediate allele carriers (7.14 %) were 
      detected among PD patients, compared with three carriers (1.57 %) among the 
      controls (P = 0.01). No pre-mutation carriers were identified. Our results 
      indicate that there is a potential association between FMR1 intermediate expanded 
      alleles and PD.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) belongs to the broad spectrum of genetic 
      disorders associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). ASD were reported 
      predominantly in congenital and early childhood forms of DM1. We describe 
      dizygotic twin boys with ASD who were referred for routine laboratory genetic 
      testing and in whom karyotyping, FMR1 gene testing, and single nucleotide 
      polymorphism array analysis yielded negative results. The father of the boys was 
      later diagnosed with suspected DM1, and testing revealed characteristic DMPK gene 
      expansions in his genome as well as in the genomes of both twins and their elder 
      brother, who also suffered from ASD. In accord with previous reports on childhood 
      forms of DM1, our patients showed prominent neuropsychiatric phenotypes 
      characterized especially by hypotonia, developmental and language delay, 
      emotional and affective lability, lowered adaptability, and social withdrawal. 
      The experience with this family and multiple literature reports of ASD in DM1 on 
      the one side but the lack of literature data on the frequency of DMPK gene 
      expansions in ASD patients on the other side prompted us to screen the DMPK gene 
      in a sample of 330 patients with ASD who were first seen by a geneticist before 
      they were 10 years of age, before the muscular weakness, which may signal DM1, 
      usually becomes obvious. The absence of any DMPK gene expansions in this cohort 
      indicates that targeted DMPK gene testing can be recommended only in ASD patients 
      with specific symptoms or family history suggestive of DM1.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS, OMIM #300624) is an X-linked condition 
      caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 5' UTR (untranslated region) of 
      the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. FXS testing is commonly performed 
      in expanded carrier screening and has been proposed for inclusion in newborn 
      screening. However, because pathogenic alleles are long and have low complexity 
      (>200 CGG repeats), FXS is currently tested by a single-plex 
      electrophoresis-resolved PCR assay rather than multiplexed approaches like 
      next-generation sequencing or mass spectrometry. In this work, we sought an 
      experimental design based on nonadaptive group testing that could accurately and 
      reliably identify the size of abnormally expanded FMR1 alleles of males and 
      females. METHODS: We developed a new group testing scheme named StairCase (SC) 
      that was designed to the constraints of the FXS testing problem, and compared its 
      performance to existing group testing schemes by simulation. We experimentally 
      evaluated SC's performance on 210 samples from the Coriell Institute 
      biorepositories using pooled PCR followed by capillary electrophoresis on 3 
      replicates of each of 3 pooling layouts differing by the mapping of samples to 
      pools. RESULTS: The SC pooled PCR approach demonstrated perfect classification of 
      samples by clinical category (normal, intermediate, premutation, or full 
      mutation) for 90 positives and 1800 negatives, with a batch of 210 samples 
      requiring only 21 assays. CONCLUSIONS: Group testing based on SC is an 
      implementable approach to trinucleotide repeat expansion disorder testing that 
      offers >/=10-fold reduction in assay costs over current single-plex methods.

TI  - A MutSbeta-Dependent Contribution of MutSalpha to Repeat Expansions in Fragile X 
      Premutation Mice?
PG  - e1006190

LID - e1006190
AB  - The fragile X-related disorders result from expansion of a CGG/CCG microsatellite 
      in the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene. We have previously demonstrated that the 
      MSH2/MSH3 complex, MutSbeta, that is important for mismatch repair, is essential for 
      almost all expansions in a mouse model of these disorders. Here we show that the 
      MSH2/MSH6 complex, MutSalpha also contributes to the production of both germ line and 
      somatic expansions as evidenced by the reduction in the number of expansions 
      observed in Msh6-/- mice. This effect is not mediated via an indirect effect of 
      the loss of MSH6 on the level of MSH3. However, since MutSbeta is required for 98% 
      of germ line expansions and almost all somatic ones, MutSalpha is apparently not able 
      to efficiently substitute for MutSbeta in the expansion process. Using purified 
      human proteins we demonstrate that MutSalpha, like MutSbeta, binds to substrates with 
      loop-outs of the repeats and increases the thermal stability of the structures 
      that they form. We also show that MutSalpha facilitates binding of MutSbeta to these 
      loop-outs. These data suggest possible models for the contribution of MutSalpha to 
      repeat expansion. In addition, we show that unlike MutSbeta, MutSalpha may also act to 
      protect against repeat contractions in the Fmr1 gene.

AB  - Population-based screening for CGG-repeat expansions in the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) gene that cause fragile X syndrome can now be performed more 
      cost-effectively and simply by combining direct triplet-primed PCR (dTP-PCR) with 
      melting curve analysis (MCA). We have now performed a detailed technical 
      validation to define the operational parameters for achieving robust and reliable 
      performance of the FMR1 dTP-PCR MCA assay. We compared the assay's performance on 
      2 real-time PCR platforms and determined its analytic sensitivity and 
      specificity. We also assessed the assay's performance on DNA isolated from 
      different sources, the effect of differences in CGG-repeat length and 
      AGG-interruption pattern on melt peak temperature (Tm), and the effect of common 
      substances found in DNA solutions on Tms. The assay performed well in 
      distinguishing normal from expansion-carrying samples. The assay had detection 
      sensitivity down to 1 ng and an analytical specificity beyond 150 ng. In addition 
      to peripheral blood DNA, analysis could also be performed on DNA from saliva, 
      buccal swabs, and dried blood spots. Salt increased Tms, glycogen contamination 
      had minimal effect, whereas AGG interruptions lowered Tms. The FMR1 dTP-PCR MCA 
      screening assay is highly sensitive and specific, performs well using DNA from 
      different sources, and is robust and reproducible when reagent concentrations are 
      maintained across all tested samples.

TI  - Clinical Phenotype of Adult Fragile X Gray Zone Allele Carriers: a Case Series.
PG  - 623-31
LID - 10.1007/s12311-016-0809-6 [doi]
AB  - Considerable research has focused on patients with trinucleotide (CGG) repeat 
      expansions in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene that fall within 
      either the full mutation (>200 repeats) or premutation range (55-200 repeats). 
      Recent interest in individuals with gray zone expansions (41-54 CGG repeats) has 
      grown due to reported phenotypes that are similar to those observed in 
      premutation carriers, including neurological, molecular, and cognitive signs. The 
      purpose of this manuscript is to describe a series of adults with FMR1 alleles in 
      the gray zone presenting with movement disorders or memory loss. Gray zone 
      carriers ascertained in large FMR1 screening studies were identified and their 
      clinical phenotypes studied. Thirty-one gray zone allele carriers were included, 
      with mean age of symptom onset of 53 years in patients with movement disorders 
      and 57 years in those with memory loss. Four patients were chosen for 
      illustrative case reports and had the following diagnoses: early-onset Parkinson 
      disease (PD), atypical parkinsonism, dementia, and atypical essential tremor. 
      Some gray zone carriers presenting with parkinsonism had typical features, 
      including bradykinesia, rigidity, and a positive response to dopaminergic 
      medication. These patients had a higher prevalence of peripheral neuropathy and 
      psychiatric complaints than would be expected. The patients seen in memory 
      clinics had standard presentations of cognitive impairment with no apparent 
      differences. Further studies are necessary to determine the associations between 
      FMR1 expansions in the gray zone and various phenotypes of neurological 
      dysfunction.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence and predictors of subjective memory 
      complaints among a cohort of male FMR1 premutation (PM) carriers with and without 
      fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). METHOD: Twenty-two PM males 
      (ages 26-80, 7 with FXTAS) and 24 matched controls with normal FMR1 alleles (ages 
      26-77) completed cross-sectional assessments of subjective memory complaints 
      (memory complaints questionnaire, MAC-Q), objective memory function (Logical 
      Memory subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scale, third edition), and psychiatric 
      symptoms (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales; the Structured Clinical 
      Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders). RESULTS: Although a greater proportion 
      of PM males (36%) endorsed subjective memory complaints compared to controls 
      (21%), formal statistical comparisons failed to reach significance. Multiple 
      linear regression analyses revealed that subjective memory complaints were not 
      associated with objective memory performance, but rather were predicted by 
      elevated psychiatric symptoms. The relationship between psychiatric symptoms and 
      subjective complaints found in the PM group was not statistically different to 
      that found in the control group. There were no significant relationships between 
      FMR1 molecular measures (CGG repeat length, FMR1 mRNA level) and measures of 
      subjective memory complaints, objective memory performance, or psychiatric 
      symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In keeping with findings from the general population, this 
      study suggests that subjective ratings of memory performance in PM males are 
      associated with underlying psychological factors rather than cross-sectional 
      objective memory function. However, future longitudinal studies are required to 
      determine whether subjective memory complaints may predict changes in objective 
      memory function over time.

TI  - Broad autism spectrum and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in adults with the 
      fragile X premutation.
PG  - 929-43
LID - 10.1080/13854046.2016.1189536 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinical observations and a limited number of research studies provide 
      evidence that the fragile X premutation may confer risk for autism, executive 
      dysfunction, and psychopathology. The link to autism spectrum symptoms and social 
      cognition deficits with the premutation remains uncertain, and thus was the focus 
      of the present investigation. METHOD: Our sample included 131 individuals, 42 
      men/22 women with the FMR1 premutation (mean age = 31.83 +/- 8.59 years) with a 
      normal neurological exam, and 48 men/19 women healthy age-matched controls (mean 
      age = 29.48 +/- 7.29 years). Individuals completed a comprehensive 
      neuropsychological battery with additional assessments for social cognition, 
      broad autism spectrum, and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms. RESULTS: 
      Premutation carriers self-reported higher rates of autism-related symptoms 
      (Autism Quotient; p = .001). Among males only, premutation carriers showed more 
      atypical social interaction (p < .001) and stereotyped behavior (p = .014) during 
      standardized clinical examination on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule 
      (ADOS) relative to controls. Female premutation carriers reported significantly 
      higher rates of OC symptoms compared to control females (p = .012). Molecular 
      measures defining the expanded premutation (FMR1 CGG repeat length and/or mRNA) 
      were significantly associated with a measure of theory of mind (Reading the Mind 
      in the Eyes Task). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate a higher rate 
      of broad autism spectrum symptoms in some males with the premutation and provide 
      evidence for an obsessive-compulsive subtype in female premutation carriers.

TI  - Warburg effect linked to cognitive-executive deficits in FMR1 premutation.
PG  - 3334-3351
AB  - A 55-200 CGG repeat expansion in the 5'-UTR of the fragile X mental retardation 1 
      (FMR1) gene is known as a premutation. Some carriers are affected by the 
      neurodegenerative disorder fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), 
      primary ovarian insufficiency, and neurobehavioral impairments. Based on the 
      mitochondrial dysfunction observed in fibroblasts and brain samples from 
      carriers, as well as in neurons and brains from a mouse model of the premutation, 
      we evaluated the presence of the Warburg effect in peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells (PBMCs) from 30 premutation carriers with either a rebalance of the 
      metabolism [increasing glycolysis while decreasing oxidative phosphorylation 
      (oxphos)] or a metabolic amplification (increasing glycolysis while 
      maintaining/increasing oxphos). Deficits in oxphos-more pronounced in 
      FXTAS-affected subjects-were accompanied by a shift toward glycolysis, suggesting 
      increased glycolysis despite aerobic conditions. Differential proteomics extended 
      these findings, unveiling a decreased antioxidant response, translation, and 
      disrupted extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton organization with activation of 
      prosenescence pathways. Lower bioenergetics segregated with increased incidence 
      of low executive function, tremors, below-average IQ, and FXTAS. The combination 
      of functional and proteomic data unveiled new mechanisms related to energy 
      production in the premutation, showing the potential of being applicable to other 
      psychiatric disorders to identify endophenotype-specific responses relevant to 
      neurobiology.-Napoli, E., Song, G., Schneider, A., Hagerman, R., Eldeeb, M. A. A.

TI  - Carriage of One or Two FMR1 Premutation Alleles Seems to Have No Effect on 
      Illness Severity in a FXTAS Female with an Autozygous FMR1 Premutation Allele.
PG  - 570-7
LID - 10.1007/s12311-016-0783-z [doi]
AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder that occurs in FMR1 premutation carriers. The 
      prevalence of FMR1 premutation carriers in the general population is relatively 
      high, and although rare, a premutation in both X chromosomes may occur in females 
      inheriting a premutation allele from each of both parent carriers. Here, we 
      report the first female with an autozygous (homozygous by descendent) FMR1 
      premutation allele, who fulfills neurological and radiological FXTAS 
      findings/criteria. Molecular characterization included CGG repeat length, AGG 
      interruption pattern, FMR1 messenger RNA (mRNA), fragile X mental retardation 
      protein (FMRP) level quantification, and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
      microarray. Neuroradiological assessment of 3-T magnetic resonance imaging and 
      neurological and cognitive/neuropsychological evaluations were performed. 
      Neurological and neuroradiological examination of the female with the same FMR1 
      allele in the premutation range (77 CGGs) demonstrated FXTAS features. Further 
      familial evaluation showed a similar neuropsychiatric profile, with impairments 
      in cognitive flexibility and visuospatial function, mainly. A unique family with 
      an autozygous FMR1 premutation female is presented. Neurological/cognitive and 
      neuroradiological examinations revealed FXTAS-specific findings in the female 
      with the autozygous FMR1 premutation allele. The consistent molecular and 
      cognitive/psychiatric phenotype in family members suggests that carrying one or 
      two FMR1 premutation alleles has no effect on illness severity.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most commonly inherited form of intellectual 
      disability and is a disorder that is also highly associated with autism. FXS 
      occurs as a result of an expanded CGG repeat sequence leading to transcriptional 
      silencing. In an animal model of FXS in which Fmr1 is knocked out (Fmr1 KO), many 
      physical, physiological, and behavioral characteristics of the human disease are 
      recapitulated. Prior characterization of the mouse model was conducted during the 
      day, the inactive phase of the circadian cycle. Circadian rhythms are an 
      important contributor to behavior and may play a role in the study of disease 
      phenotype. Moreover, changes in the parameters of circadian rhythm are known to 
      occur in FXS animal models. We conducted an investigation of key behavioral 
      phenotypes in Fmr1 KO mice during their active phase. We report that phase did 
      not alter the Fmr1 KO phenotype in open field activity, anxiety, and learning and 
      memory. There was a slight effect of phase on social behavior as measured by time 
      in chamber, but not by time spent sniffing. Our data strengthen the existing data 
      characterizing the phenotype of Fmr1 KO mice, indicating that it is independent 
      of circadian phase.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to describe a case series of 4 sisters 
      with discordant clinical phenotypes associated with fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) that may be explained by varying CGG repeat sizes 
      and activation ratios (ARs) (the ratio of cells carrying the normal fragile X 
      mental retardation 1 [FMR1] allele on the active X chromosome). METHODS: Four 
      sisters with premutation size FMR1 gene repeats underwent detailed clinical 
      characterization. CGG repeat length was determined by PCR, and AR was determined 
      using a newly developed commercial methylation PCR assay and was compared with 
      the results from Southern blot with densitometric image analysis. RESULTS: Sister 
      1 had the largest CGG expansion (82) and the lowest AR (12%), with the most 
      severe clinical presentation. Sister 2 had a lower CGG expansion (70) and an AR 
      of 10% but had a milder clinical presentation.Sister 3 had a similar CGG 
      expansion (79) but a slightly higher AR of 15% and less neurologic involvement. 
      Sister 4 had a similar CGG expansion size of 80 but had the largest AR (40%) and 
      was the only sister not to be affected by FXTAS or have any neurologic signs on 
      examination. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that premutation carrier women 
      who have higher ARs may be less likely to show manifestations of FXTAS. If larger 
      studies show similar patterns, AR data could potentially be beneficial to 
      supplement CGG repeat size when counseling premutation carrier women in the 
      clinic.

TI  - Unique AGG Interruption in the CGG Repeats of the FMR1 Gene Exclusively Found in 
      Asians Linked to a Specific SNP Haplotype.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited intellectual disability. It 
      is caused by the occurrence of more than 200 pure CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene. 
      Normal individuals have 6-54 CGG repeats with two or more stabilizing AGG 
      interruptions occurring once every 9- or 10-CGG-repeat blocks in various 
      populations. However, the unique (CGG)6AGG pattern, designated as 6A, has been 
      exclusively reported in Asians. To examine the genetic background of AGG 
      interruptions in the CGG repeats of the FMR1 gene, we studied 8 SNPs near the CGG 
      repeats in 176 unrelated Thai males with 19-56 CGG repeats. Of these 176 samples, 
      we identified AGG interruption patterns from 95 samples using direct DNA 
      sequencing. We found that the common CGG repeat groups (29, 30, and 36) were 
      associated with 3 common haplotypes, GCGGATAA (Hap A), TTCATCGC (Hap C), and 
      GCCGTTAA (Hap B), respectively. The configurations of 9A9A9, 10A9A9, and 9A9A6A9 
      were commonly found in chromosomes with 29, 30, and 36 CGG repeats, respectively. 
      Almost all chromosomes with Hap B (22/23) carried at least one 6A pattern, 
      suggesting that the 6A pattern is linked to Hap B and may have originally 
      occurred in the ancestors of Asian populations.

      Mechanism of Initiation to Produce Toxic Proteins.

AB  - Repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation produces toxic polypeptides from 
      nucleotide repeat expansions in the absence of an AUG start codon and contributes 
      to neurodegenerative disorders such as ALS and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome. How RAN translation occurs is unknown. Here we define the critical 
      sequence and initiation factors that mediate CGG repeat RAN translation in the 5' 
      leader of fragile X mRNA, FMR1. Our results reveal that CGG RAN translation is 
      30%-40% as efficient as AUG-initiated translation, is m(7)G cap and eIF4E 
      dependent, requires the eIF4A helicase, and is strongly influenced by repeat 
      length. However, it displays a dichotomous requirement for initiation site 
      selection between reading frames, with initiation in the +1 frame, but not the +2 
      frame, occurring at near-cognate start codons upstream of the repeat. These data 
      support a model in which RAN translation at CGG repeats uses cap-dependent 
      ribosomal scanning, yet bypasses normal requirements for start codon selection.

AB  - Triplet repeat expansions in the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene cause 
      either intellectual disability and autism, or adult-onset neurodegeneration, with 
      poorly understood variability in presentation. Previous studies have identified 
      several long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) at the FMR1 locus, including FMR4. 
      Similarly to FMR1, FMR4 is silenced by large-repeat expansions that result in 
      enrichment of DNA and histone methylation within the shared promoter and repeat 
      sequence, suggesting a possible role for this noncoding RNA in the 
      pathophysiology of Fragile X. We therefore assessed the functional role of FMR4 
      to gain further insight into the molecular processes in Fragile X-associated 
      disorders. Previous work showed that FMR4 does not exhibit cis-regulation of 
      FMR1. Here, we found that FMR4 is a chromatin-associated transcript and, using 
      genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, showed that FMR4 alters 
      the chromatin state and the expression of several hundred genes in trans. Among 
      the genes regulated by FMR4, we found enrichment for those involved in neural 
      development and cellular proliferation. S-phase marker assays further 
      demonstrated that FMR4 may promote cellular proliferation, rather than 
      differentiation, of human neural precursor cells (hNPCs). By establishing this 
      novel function for FMR4 in hNPCs, we lend support to existing evidence of the 
      epigenetic involvement of lncRNA in nervous system development, and increase our 
      understanding of the complex pathogenesis underlying neurological disorders 
      associated with FMR1 repeat expansions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study a broad range of FMR1 CGG repeat lengths and assisted 
      reproduction technology (ART) outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. 
      SETTING: Private ART practice. PATIENT(S): Fresh autologous ART stimulation 
      cycles. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Oocyte yield, live birth. 
      RESULT(S): We screened 14,088 fresh autologous ART cycles from 2012 to 2015, of 
      which 4,690 cycles in 3,290 patients met the inclusion criteria. The FMR1 repeat 
      length was statistically significantly but weakly associated with oocyte yield 
      and other markers of ovarian response. The receiver operating characteristic 
      curve analysis suggested extremely limited predictive ability. Moreover, the FMR1 
      repeat length was not statistically significantly associated with outcomes in 
      multivariable models, including other markers of ovarian reserve. The FMR1 repeat 
      length was not associated with embryo quality or live birth. Only patient age had 
      a strong ability to predict live birth. CONCLUSION(S): The FMR1 repeat length is 
      associated with ART response, but only weakly. It provides no incremental 
      predictive ability beyond the conventionally used predictors, including patient 
      age, antimullerian hormone concentration, antral follicle count, and 
      follicle-stimulating hormone level. These data suggest a possible role of the 
      FMR1 repeat length within the normal range in ovarian response but demonstrate no 
      clinically relevant indication for testing FMR1 as a predictor of ART outcomes.

TI  - Single-locus enrichment without amplification for sequencing and direct detection 
      of epigenetic modifications.
PG  - 1491-504
LID - 10.1007/s00438-016-1167-2 [doi]
AB  - A gene-level targeted enrichment method for direct detection of epigenetic 
      modifications is described. The approach is demonstrated on the CGG-repeat region 
      of the FMR1 gene, for which large repeat expansions, hitherto refractory to 
      sequencing, are known to cause fragile X syndrome. In addition to achieving a 
      single-locus enrichment of nearly 700,000-fold, the elimination of all 
      amplification steps removes PCR-induced bias in the repeat count and preserves 
      the native epigenetic modifications of the DNA. In conjunction with the 
      single-molecule real-time sequencing approach, this enrichment method enables 
      direct readout of the methylation status and the CGG repeat number of the FMR1 
      allele(s) for a clonally derived cell line. The current method avoids potential 
      biases introduced through chemical modification and/or amplification methods for 
      indirect detection of CpG methylation events.

TI  - Structural characterization of a dimer of RNA duplexes composed of 
      8-bromoguanosine modified CGG trinucleotide repeats: a novel architecture of RNA 
      quadruplexes.
PG  - 2409-16
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkv1534 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) are 
      neurodegenerative disorders caused by the pathogenic expansion of CGG triplet 
      repeats in the FMR1 gene. FXTAS is likely to be caused by a 'toxic' 
      gain-of-function of the FMR1 mRNA. We provide evidence for the existence of a 
      novel quadruplex architecture comprising CGG repeats. The 8-bromoguanosine 
      ((Br)G)-modified molecule GC(Br)GGCGGC forms a duplex in solution and 
      self-associates via the major groove to form a four-stranded, antiparallel 
      (GC(Br)GGCGGC)4 RNA quadruplex with (Br)G3:G6:(Br)G3:G6 tetrads sandwiched 
      between mixed G:C:G:C tetrads. Self-association of Watson-Crick duplexes to form 
      a four-stranded structure has previously been predicted; however, no experimental 
      evidence was provided. This novel four-stranded RNA structure was characterized 
      using a variety of experimental methods, such as native gel electrophoresis, NMR 
      spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering and electrospray ionization mass 
      spectrometry.

PG  - 501-7
LID - 10.1586/14737159.2016.1135739 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Almost all patients with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) exhibit a CGG repeat 
      expansion (full mutation) in the Fragile Mental Retardation 1 gene (FMR1). Here, 
      the authors report five unrelated males with FXS harboring a somatic full 
      mutation/deletion mosaicism. METHODS: Mutational profiles were only elucidated by 
      using a combination of molecular approaches (CGG-based PCR, Sanger sequencing, 
      MS-MLPA, Southern blot and mPCR). RESULTS: Four patients exhibited small 
      deletions encompassing the CGG repeats tract and flanking regions, whereas the 
      remaining had a larger deletion comprising at least exon 1 and part of intron 1 
      of FMR1 gene. The presence of a 2-3 base pairs microhomology in proximal and 
      distal non-recurrent breakpoints without scars supports the involvement of 
      microhomology mediated induced repair (MMBIR) mechanism in three small deletions. 
      CONCLUSION: The authors data highlights the importance of using different 
      research methods to elucidate atypical FXS mutational profiles, which are 
      clinically undistinguishable and may have been underestimated.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the commonest cause of inherited mental retardation 
      and clinically presents with learning, emotional and behaviour problems. FXS is 
      caused by expansion of cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeats present in the 5' 
      untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. The aim of this study was to screen 
      children attending special education institutions in Sri Lanka to estimate the 
      prevalence of CGG repeat expansions. The study population comprised a 
      representative national sample of 850 children (540 males, 310 females) with 5 to 
      18 years of age from moderate to severe mental retardation of wide ranging 
      aetiology. Screening for CGG repeat expansion was carried out on DNA extracted 
      from buccal cells using 3' direct triplet primed PCR followed by melting curve 
      analysis. To identify the expanded status of screened positive samples, capillary 
      electrophoresis, methylation specific PCR and Southern hybridization were carried 
      out using venous blood samples. Prevalence of CGG repeat expansions was 2.2%. 
      Further classification of the positive samples into FXS full mutation, 
      pre-mutation and grey zone gave prevalence of 1.3%, 0.8% and 0.1% respectively. 
      All positive cases were male. No females with FXS were detected in our study may 
      have been due to the small sample size.

TI  - A 3' untranslated region variant in FMR1 eliminates neuronal activity-dependent 
      translation of FMRP by disrupting binding of the RNA-binding protein HuR.
PG  - E6553-61

AB  - Fragile X syndrome is a common cause of intellectual disability and autism 
      spectrum disorder. The gene underlying the disorder, fragile X mental retardation 
      1 (FMR1), is silenced in most cases by a CGG-repeat expansion mutation in the 5' 
      untranslated region (UTR). Recently, we identified a variant located in the 3'UTR 
      of FMR1 enriched among developmentally delayed males with normal repeat lengths. 
      A patient-derived cell line revealed reduced levels of endogenous fragile X 
      mental retardation protein (FMRP), and a reporter containing a patient 3'UTR 
      caused a decrease in expression. A control reporter expressed in cultured mouse 
      cortical neurons showed an expected increase following synaptic stimulation that 
      was absent when expressing the patient reporter, suggesting an impaired response 
      to neuronal activity. Mobility-shift assays using a control RNA detected an 
      RNA-protein interaction that is lost with the patient RNA, and HuR was 
      subsequently identified as an associated protein. Cross-linking 
      immunoprecipitation experiments identified the locus as an in vivo target of HuR, 
      supporting our in vitro findings. These data suggest that the disrupted 
      interaction of HuR impairs activity-dependent translation of FMRP, which may 
      hinder synaptic plasticity in a clinically significant fashion.

TI  - Presence of inclusions positive for polyglycine containing protein, FMRpolyG, 
      indicates that repeat-associated non-AUG translation plays a role in fragile 
      X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency.
PG  - 158-68
LID - 10.1093/humrep/dev280 [doi]
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Does repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation play a role in 
      fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI), leading to the 
      presence of polyglycine containing protein (FMRpolyG)-positive inclusions in 
      ovarian tissue? SUMMARY ANSWER: Ovaries of a woman with FXPOI and of an Fmr1 
      premutation (PM) mouse model (exCGG-KI) contain intranuclear inclusions that 
      stain positive for both FMRpolyG and ubiquitin. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Women who 
      carry the FMR1 PM are at 20-fold increased risk to develop primary ovarian 
      insufficiency (FXPOI). A toxic RNA gain-of-function has been suggested as the 
      underlying mechanism since the PM results in increased levels of mRNA containing 
      an expanded repeat, but reduced protein levels of fragile X mental retardation 
      protein (FMRP). Recently, RAN translation has been shown to occur from FMR1 mRNA 
      that contains PM repeat expansions, leading to FMRpolyG inclusions in brain and 
      non-CNS tissues of fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) patients. 
      STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Ovaries of a woman with FXPOI and women without PM 
      (controls), and ovaries from wild-type and exCGG-KI mice were analyzed by 
      immunohistochemistry for the presence of inclusions that stained for ubiquitin 
      and FMRpolyG . The ovaries from wild-type and exCGG-KI mice were further 
      characterized for the number of follicles, Fmr1 mRNA levels and FMRP protein 
      expression. The presence of inclusions was also analyzed in pituitaries of a man 
      with FXTAS and the exCGG-KI mice. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Human 
      ovaries from a woman with FXPOI and two control subjects and pituitaries from a 
      man with FXTAS and a control subjects were fixed in 4% formalin. Ovaries and 
      pituitaries of wild-type and exCGG mice were fixed in Bouin's fluid or 4% 
      paraformaldehyde. Immunohistochemistry was performed on the human and mouse 
      samples using FMRpolyG, ubiquitin and Fmrp antibodies. Fmr1 mRNA and protein 
      expression were determined in mouse ovaries by quantitative RT-PCR and Western 
      blot analysis. Follicle numbers in mouse ovaries were determined in serial 
      sections by microscopy. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: FMRpolyG-positive 
      inclusions were present in ovarian stromal cells of a woman with FXPOI but not in 
      the ovaries of control subjects. The FMRpolyG-positive inclusions colocalized 
      with ubiquitin-positive inclusions. Similar inclusions were also observed in the 
      pituitary of a man with FXTAS but not in control subjects. Similarly, ovaries of 
      40-week-old exCGG-KI mice, but not wild-type mice, contained numerous inclusions 
      in the stromal cells that stained for both FMRpolyG- and ubiquitin, while the 
      ovaries of 20-week-old exCGG-KI contained fewer inclusions. At 40 weeks ovarian 
      Fmr1 mRNA expression was increased by 5-fold in exCGG-KI mice compared with 
      wild-type mice, while Fmrp expression was reduced by 2-fold. With respect to 
      ovarian function in exCGG-KI mice: (i) although the number of healthy growing 
      follicles did not differ between wild-type and exCGG-KI mice, the number of 
      atretic large antral follicles was increased by nearly 9-fold in 40-week old 
      exCGG-KI mice (P < 0.001); (ii) at 40 weeks of age only 50% of exCGG-KI mice had 
      recent ovulations compared with 89% in wild-type mice (P = 0.07) and (iii) those 
      exCGG-KI mice with recent ovulations tended to have a reduced number of fresh 
      corpora lutea (4.8 +/- 1.74 versus 8.50 +/- 0.98, exCGG-KI versus wild-type mice, 
      respectively, P = 0.07). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Although 
      FMRpolyG-positive inclusions were detected in ovaries of both a woman with FXPOI 
      and a mouse model of the FMR1 PM, we only analyzed one ovary from a FXPOI 
      subject. Caution is needed to extrapolate these results to all women with the 
      FMR1 PM. Furthermore, the functional consequence of FMRpolyG-positive inclusions 
      in the ovaries for reproduction remains to be determined. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF 
      THE FINDINGS: Our results suggest that a dysfunctional 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal-axis may contribute to FXPOI in FMR1 PM carriers.

TI  - In situ optical sequencing and structure analysis of a trinucleotide repeat 
      genome region by localization microscopy after specific COMBO-FISH nano-probing.

LID - 10.1039/c5nr04141d [doi]
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansions (like (CGG)n) of chromatin in the genome of cell 
      nuclei can cause neurological disorders such as for example the Fragile-X 
      syndrome. Until now the mechanisms are not clearly understood as to how these 
      expansions develop during cell proliferation. Therefore in situ investigations of 
      chromatin structures on the nanoscale are required to better understand 
      supra-molecular mechanisms on the single cell level. By super-resolution 
      localization microscopy (Spectral Position Determination Microscopy; SPDM) in 
      combination with nano-probing using COMBO-FISH (COMBinatorial Oligonucleotide 
      FISH), novel insights into the nano-architecture of the genome will become 
      possible. The native spatial structure of trinucleotide repeat expansion genome 
      regions was analysed and optical sequencing of repetitive units was performed 
      within 3D-conserved nuclei using SPDM after COMBO-FISH. We analysed a 
      (CGG)n-expansion region inside the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. The 
      number of CGG repeats for a full mutation causing the Fragile-X syndrome was 
      found and also verified by Southern blot. The FMR1 promotor region was similarly 
      condensed like a centromeric region whereas the arrangement of the probes 
      labelling the expansion region seemed to indicate a loop-like nano-structure. 
      These results for the first time demonstrate that in situ chromatin structure 
      measurements on the nanoscale are feasible. Due to further methodological 
      progress it will become possible to estimate the state of trinucleotide repeat 
      mutations in detail and to determine the associated chromatin strand structural 
      changes on the single cell level. In general, the application of the described 
      approach to any genome region will lead to new insights into genome 
      nano-architecture and open new avenues for understanding mechanisms and their 
      relevance in the development of heredity diseases.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual 
      disability, resulting from a CGG repeat expansion in the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Here, we report a strategy for CGG repeat correction 
      using CRISPR/Cas9 for targeted deletion in both embryonic stem cells and induced 
      pluripotent stem cells derived from FXS patients. Following gene correction in 
      FXS induced pluripotent stem cells, FMR1 expression was restored and sustained in 
      neural precursor cells and mature neurons. Strikingly, after removal of the CGG 
      repeats, the upstream CpG island of the FMR1 promoter showed extensive 
      demethylation, an open chromatin state, and transcription initiation. These 
      results suggest a silencing maintenance mechanism for the FMR1 promoter that is 
      dependent on the existence of the CGG repeat expansion. Our strategy for deletion 
      of trinucleotide repeats provides further insights into the molecular mechanisms 
      of FXS and future therapies of trinucleotide repeat disorders.

TI  - Mutsbeta generates both expansions and contractions in a mouse model of the Fragile 
      X-associated disorders.
PG  - 7087-96
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddv408 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X-associated disorders are Repeat Expansion Diseases that result from 
      expansion of a CGG/CCG-repeat in the FMR1 gene. Contractions of the repeat tract 
      also occur, albeit at lower frequency. However, these contractions can 
      potentially modulate disease symptoms or generate an allele with repeat numbers 
      in the normal range. Little is known about the expansion mechanism and even less 
      about contractions. We have previously demonstrated that the mismatch repair 
      (MMR) protein MSH2 is required for expansions in a mouse model of these 
      disorders. Here, we show that MSH3, the MSH2-binding partner in the MutSbeta 
      complex, is required for 98% of germ line expansions and all somatic expansions 
      in this model. In addition, we provide evidence for two different contraction 
      mechanisms that operate in the mouse model, a MutSbeta-independent one that 
      generates small contractions and a MutSbeta-dependent one that generates larger 
      ones. We also show that MutSbeta complexes formed with the repeats have altered 
      kinetics of ATP hydrolysis relative to complexes with bona fide MMR substrates 
      and that MutSbeta increases the stability of the CCG-hairpins at physiological 
      temperatures. These data may have important implications for our understanding of 
      the mechanism(s) of repeat instability and for the role of MMR proteins in this 
      process.

TI  - Diminished ovarian reserve is not observed in infertility patients with high 
      normal CGG repeats on the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene.
PG  - 2686-92
LID - 10.1093/humrep/dev220 [doi]
AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Does an association exist between high normal numbers of CGG 
      trinucleotide repeats on the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene and 
      diminished ovarian reserve (DOR)? SUMMARY ANSWER: This large data set 
      demonstrated that a high normal number of CGG repeats (35-54 repeats) on the FMR1 
      gene was not significantly correlated with DOR. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The FMR1 
      premutation (55-200 repeats) is a known cause of primary ovarian insufficiency. 
      However, the relationship between high normal CGG repeat numbers (35-54 repeats) 
      and ovarian reserve has yet to be conclusively demonstrated. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, 
      DURATION: This is a retrospective data analysis conducted between January 2012 
      and February 2014 that included 1287 women. Over 1140 women had complete data. 
      PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All women, excluding oocyte donors, who 
      presented to a large private practice specializing in reproductive endocrinology 
      and infertility for treatment and who underwent both fragile X and ovarian 
      reserve testing were included. All fragile X testing was performed using triplet 
      repeat PCR, with confirmation of positives by Southern blot. CGG repeat numbers 
      from both alleles were recorded, and the allele with the higher number of repeats 
      was used for statistical calculations. We did not differentiate between patients 
      with one or two high normal alleles. Women with >54 CGG repeats were excluded 
      from the analysis. For our analysis, we considered both a 'high normal' number of 
      CGG repeats (35-44) and an intermediate number of GCC repeats (45-54) as 'high 
      normal'. Ovarian reserve testing was carried out on Cycle Day 2 or 3 and included 
      measurements of FSH, anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and antral follicle count 
      (AFC). A generalized linear regression model assuming gamma distribution and log 
      link function that controlled for age was used to assess correlation between CGG 
      repeat number and FSH, AMH and AFC. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: As 
      expected, there was a significant correlation between increasing age and 
      increasing FSH and decreasing AFC and AMH for the patients in this study. For 
      every 1-year increase in age, FSH increased by a factor of 1.04, AFC decreased by 
      a factor of 0.93 and AMH decreased by a factor of 0.89. After controlling for 
      age, there was no significant correlation between FMR1 CGG trinucleotide repeat 
      number and FSH (P = 0.23), AFC (P = 0.14) or AMH (P = 0.53). Three subgroup 
      analyses were also performed. We found a significant relationship between 
      increasing CGG repeat number and decreasing AMH levels (P = 0.01) in women >44 
      years old. The second subgroup analysis included only Caucasian patients and 
      found no significant correlation between CGG repeat number and DOR. In a subgroup 
      analysis comparing women with at least one allele <26 repeats, at least one 
      allele >35 and women with both alleles between 29 and 32, there were no 
      significant associations regarding ovarian reserve in any of these groups. 
      LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: One limitation of this study is that it 
      involved a heterogeneous population of infertile women with mixed diagnoses. 
      Factors that could affect ovarian reserve, such as medical comorbidities, prior 
      surgeries, family history and endometriosis, were not accounted for. Finally, 
      there was a lack of racial diversity, with Caucasians representing 67.8% of the 
      total population. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The findings of this study 
      are generalizable to an infertility population and are in line with several 
      previously published studies. Women who are found to have high normal CGG repeat 
      numbers can be counseled that this is not causative for DOR. Further studies are 
      needed to investigate whether increasing CGG repeat numbers are associated with 
      ovarian responsiveness to gonadotrophin stimulation or IVF outcome.

AB  - CGG repeat expansions in the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are 
      responsible for a family of associated disorders characterized by either 
      intellectual disability and autism Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), or adult-onset 
      neurodegeneration Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome. However, the FMR1 
      locus is complex and encodes several long non-coding RNAs, whose expression is 
      altered by repeat expansion mutations. The role of these lncRNAs is thus far 
      unknown; therefore we investigated the functionality of FMR4, which we previously 
      identified. "Full"-length expansions of the FMR1 triplet repeat cause silencing 
      of both FMR1 and FMR4, thus we are interested in potential loss-of-function that 
      may add to phenotypic manifestation of FXS. Since the two transcripts do not 
      exhibit cis-regulation of one another, we examined the potential for FMR4 to 
      regulate target genes at distal genomic loci using gene expression microarrays. 
      We identified FMR4-responsive genes, including the methyl-CpG-binding domain 
      protein 4 (MBD4). Furthermore, we found that in differentiating human neural 
      precursor cells, FMR4 expression is developmentally regulated in opposition to 
      expression of both FMR1 (which is expected to share a bidirectional promoter with 
      FMR4) and MBD4. We therefore propose that FMR4's function is as a gene-regulatory 
      lncRNA and that this transcript may function in normal development. Closer 
      examination of FMR4 increases our understanding of the role of regulatory lncRNA 
      and the consequences of FMR1 repeat expansions.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) results from a "premutation" 
      (PM) size CGG repeat expansion in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. 
      Cerebellar gait ataxia is the primary feature in some FXTAS patients causing 
      progressive disability. However, no studies have quantitatively characterized 
      gait and mobility deficits in FXTAS. We performed quantitative gait and mobility 
      analysis in seven FMR1 PM carriers with FXTAS and ataxia, six PM carriers without 
      FXTAS, and 18 age-matched controls. We studied four independent gait domains, 
      trunk range of motion (ROM), and movement transitions using an instrumented Timed 
      Up and Go (i-TUG). We correlated these outcome measures with FMR1 molecular 
      variables and clinical severity scales. PM carriers with FXTAS were globally 
      impaired in every gait performance domain except trunk ROM compared to controls. 
      These included total i-TUG duration, stride velocity, gait cycle time, cadence, 
      double-limb support and swing phase times, turn duration, step time before turn, 
      and turn-to-sit duration, and increased gait variability on several measures. 
      Carriers without FXTAS did not differ from controls on any parameters, but 
      double-limb support time was close to significance. Balance and disability scales 
      correlated with multiple gait and movement transition parameters, while the FXTAS 
      Rating Scale did not. This is the first study to quantitatively examine gait and 
      movement transitions in FXTAS patients. Gait characteristics were consistent with 
      those from previous cohorts with cerebellar ataxia. Sensitive measures like the 
      i-TUG may help determine efficacy of interventions, characterize disease 
      progression, and provide early markers of disease in FXTAS.

TI  - A genetic study of the FMR1 gene in a Sardinian multiple sclerosis population.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex autoimmune disease originated from the 
      interplay between genetic and environmental factors. An overlap of clinical and 
      neuroradiological parameters has been described between MS and an adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder, the fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS). This syndrome is caused by a trinucleotide premutation expansion of a 
      CGG sequence in the 55-200 repeat range, which is located in the fragile-X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Female premutation carriers have an increased 
      propensity for immune-mediated disorders. Recently, a case of co-occurrence of MS 
      and FXTAS was reported. Assuming that the premutation expansion may play a role 
      in the MS susceptibility, we evaluated its frequency in a cohort of MS patients 
      from Sardinia, an island characterized by a very high frequency of MS. Nuclear 
      DNA was extracted by standard methods, purified with bisulfite treatment and then 
      amplified twice by PCR with specific primers. Microsatellite analysis was 
      performed and emizogotic subjects were sequenced. Clinical data of patients were 
      also collected. Only 1/755 MS patients exhibited the premutation expansion with a 
      heterozygosis pattern (30/58). No pathogenic repeat expansions (>200 repeats) 
      were found in the entire cohort. Repeats labeled as the gray zone (45-60 repeats) 
      were observed in 15/755 patients. No specific clinical features concerning 
      disease course, disease activity, and disability were reported for these 
      patients. Our results do not support a possible role for premutation or gray zone 
      alleles in MS Sardinian patients. Further studies are needed to better understand 
      the relationship between FXTAS and MS.

AB  - A hexanucleotide repeat expansion residing within the C9ORF72 gene represents the 
      most common known cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and places the 
      disease among a growing family of repeat expansion disorders. The presence of RNA 
      foci, repeat-associated translation products, and sequestration of RNA binding 
      proteins suggests that toxic RNA gain-of-function contributes to pathology while 
      C9ORF72 haploinsufficiency may be an additional pathological factor. One viable 
      therapeutic strategy for treating expansion diseases is the use of small molecule 
      inhibitors of epigenetic modifier proteins to reactivate expanded genetic loci. 
      Indeed, previous studies have established proof of this principle by increasing 
      the drug-induced expression of expanded (and abnormally heterochromatinized) 
      FMR1, FXN and C9ORF72 genes in respective patient cells. While epigenetic 
      modifier proteins are increasingly recognized as druggable targets, there have 
      been few screening strategies to address this avenue of drug discovery in the 
      context of expansion diseases. Here we utilize a semi-high-throughput gene 
      expression based screen to identify siRNAs and small molecule inhibitors of 
      epigenetic modifier proteins that regulate C9ORF72 RNA in patient fibroblasts, 
      lymphocytes and reprogrammed motor neurons. We found that several bromodomain 
      small molecule inhibitors increase the expression of C9ORF72 mRNA and pre-mRNA 
      without affecting repressive epigenetic signatures of expanded C9ORF72 alleles. 
      These data suggest that bromodomain inhibition increases the expression of 
      unexpanded C9ORF72 alleles and may therefore compensate for haploinsufficiency 
      without increasing the production of toxic RNA and protein products, thereby 
      conferring therapeutic value.

TI  - Distribution of fragile X mental retardation 1 CGG repeat and flanking haplotypes 
      in a large Chinese population.
PG  - 172-81
LID - 10.1002/mgg3.128 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is mainly caused by a CGG repeat expansion within the 5' UTR 
      of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Previous analyses of the FMR1 
      CGG repeat patterns and flanking haplotypes in Caucasians and African Americans 
      have identified several factors that may influence repeat instability. However, 
      the CGG repeat patterns and distribution for FRAXAC2 have not yet been 
      investigated in mainland Chinese. We surveyed the CGG repeat lengths in 1113 Han 
      Chinese (534 males and 579 females), and the CGG repeat patterns of 534 males 
      were determined by sequence analysis. We also explored the flanking haplotypes 
      (DXS548-FRAXAC1-FRAXAC2) in 566 unaffected and 28 unrelated fragile X Chinese 
      males. The most frequent alleles for DXS548 and FRAXAC1 were identical between 
      our Chinese population and other Asian populations. We identified several 
      low-abundance alleles for DXS548 and FRAXAC1 not found in previous studies in 
      mainland Chinese and Taiwanese cohorts. The most frequent allele was (CGG)29 
      followed by (CGG)30, and the most frequent patterns were 9 + 9 + 9, 10 + 9 + 9, 
      and 9 + 9 + 6 + 9, similar to those in Singaporeans. We identified only one 
      premutation female carrier with 89 CGG repeats in the 1113 Han Chinese. A few 
      associations between the CGG repeat patterns and flanking haplotypes were 
      determined in this study. In general, the Chinese population had a smaller number 
      of alleles and lower expected heterozygosity for all three STR markers and FRAXA 
      locus when compared with Caucasians and African Americans. We identified a novel 
      haplotype 7-3-5 + that is significantly associated with the full mutation.

TI  - RAN translation at CGG repeats induces ubiquitin proteasome system impairment in 
      models of fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome.
PG  - 4317-26
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddv165 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of the 
      Fragile X gene, FMR1. FXTAS is thought to arise primarily from an RNA 
      gain-of-function toxicity mechanism. However, recent studies demonstrate that the 
      repeat also elicits production of a toxic polyglycine protein, FMRpolyG, via 
      repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN)-initiated translation. Pathologically, FXTAS is 
      characterized by ubiquitin-positive intranuclear neuronal inclusions, raising the 
      possibility that failure of protein quality control pathways could contribute to 
      disease pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we used Drosophila- and cell-based 
      models of CGG-repeat-associated toxicity. In Drosophila, ubiquitin proteasome 
      system (UPS) impairment led to enhancement of CGG-repeat-induced degeneration, 
      whereas overexpression of the chaperone protein HSP70 suppressed this toxicity. 
      In transfected mammalian cells, CGG repeat expression triggered accumulation of a 
      UPS reporter in a length-dependent fashion. To delineate the contributions from 
      CGG repeats as RNA from RAN translation-associated toxicity, we enhanced or 
      impaired the production of FMRpolyG in these models. Driving expression of 
      FMRpolyG enhanced induction of UPS impairment in cell models, while prevention of 
      RAN translation attenuated UPS impairment in cells and suppressed the genetic 
      interaction with UPS manipulation in Drosophila. Taken together, these findings 
      suggest that CGG repeats induce UPS impairment at least in part through 
      activation of RAN translation.

TI  - Chromosome fragility at FRAXA in human cleavage stage embryos at risk for fragile 
      X syndrome.
PG  - 2306-13
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.37149 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited intellectual disability 
      syndrome, is caused by expansion and hypermethylation of the CGG repeat in the 5' 
      UTR of the FMR1 gene. This expanded repeat, also known as the rare fragile site 
      FRAXA, causes X chromosome fragility in cultured cells from patients but only 
      when induced by perturbing pyrimidine synthesis. We performed preimplantation 
      genetic diagnosis (PGD) on 595 blastomeres biopsied from 442 cleavage stage 
      embryos at risk for FXS using short tandem repeat (STR) markers. In six 
      blastomeres, from five embryos an incomplete haplotype was observed with loss of 
      all alleles telomeric to the CGG repeat. In all five embryos, the incomplete 
      haplotype corresponded to the haplotype carrying the CGG repeat expansion. 
      Subsequent analysis of additional blastomeres from three embryos by array 
      comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) confirmed the presence of a terminal 
      deletion with a breakpoint close to the CGG repeat in two blastomeres from one 
      embryo. A blastomere from another embryo showed the complementary duplication. We 
      conclude that a CGG repeat expansion at FRAXA causes X chromosome fragility in 
      early human IVF embryos at risk for FXS.

TI  - Heterozygosity for a hypomorphic Polbeta mutation reduces the expansion frequency in

AB  - The Fragile X-related disorders (FXDs) are members of the Repeat Expansion 
      Diseases, a group of human genetic conditions resulting from expansion of a 
      specific tandem repeat. The FXDs result from expansion of a CGG/CCG repeat tract 
      in the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene. While expansion in a FXD mouse model is known to 
      require some mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, our previous work and work in mouse 
      models of another Repeat Expansion Disease show that early events in the base 
      excision repair (BER) pathway play a role in the expansion process. One model for 
      repeat expansion proposes that a non-canonical MMR process makes use of the nicks 
      generated early in BER to load the MMR machinery that then generates expansions. 
      However, we show here that heterozygosity for a Y265C mutation in Polbeta, a key 
      polymerase in the BER pathway, is enough to significantly reduce both the number 
      of expansions seen in paternal gametes and the extent of somatic expansion in 
      some tissues of the FXD mouse. These data suggest that events in the BER pathway 
      downstream of the generation of nicks are also important for repeat expansion. 
      Somewhat surprisingly, while the number of expansions is smaller, the average 
      size of the residual expansions is larger than that seen in WT animals. This may 
      have interesting implications for the mechanism by which BER generates 
      expansions.

AB  - Fragile-X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual 
      disability (ID) and affects 0.7-3.0% of intellectually compromised population of 
      unknown etiology worldwide. It is mostly caused by repeat expansion mutations in 
      the FMR1 at chromosome Xq27.3. The present study aimed to develop molecular 
      diagnostic tools for a better detection of FXS, to assess implementation of 
      diagnostic protocols in a developing country and to estimate the prevalence of 
      FXS in a cohort of intellectually disabled subjects from Pakistan. From a large 
      pool of individuals with below normal IQ range, 395 subjects with intellectual 
      disability of unknown etiology belonging to different regions of the country were 
      recruited. Conventional-PCR, modified-PCR and Southern blot analysis methods were 
      employed for the detection of CGG repeat polymorphisms in the FMR1 gene. Initial 
      screening with conventional-PCR identified 13 suspected patients. Subsequent 
      investigations through modified PCR and Southern blot analyses confirmed the 
      presence of the FMR1 mutation, suggesting a prevalence of 3.5% and 2.8% (mean 
      3.3%) among the male and female ID patients, respectively. These diagnostic 
      methods were further customized with the in-house conditions to offer robust 
      screening of referral patients/families for diagnostics and genetic counseling. 
      Prescreening and early diagnosis are crucial for designing a prudent strategy for 
      the management of subjects with ID. Outcome of the study recommends health 
      practitioners for implementation of molecular based FXS diagnosis in routine 
      clinical practice to give a better care for patients similar to the ones included 
      in the study.

TI  - Nuclear accumulation of mRNAs underlies G4C2-repeat-induced translational 
      repression in a cellular model of C9orf72 ALS.
PG  - 1787-99
LID - 10.1242/jcs.165332 [doi]
AB  - A common feature of non-coding repeat expansion disorders is the accumulation of 
      RNA repeats as RNA foci in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm of affected cells. These 
      RNA foci can be toxic because they sequester RNA-binding proteins, thus affecting 
      various steps of post-transcriptional gene regulation. However, the precise step 
      that is affected by C9orf72 GGGGCC (G4C2) repeat expansion, the major genetic 
      cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is still poorly defined. In this 
      work, we set out to characterise these mechanisms by identifying proteins that 
      bind to C9orf72 RNA. Sequestration of some of these factors into RNA foci was 
      observed when a (G4C2)31 repeat was expressed in NSC34 and HeLa cells. Most 
      notably, (G4C2)31 repeats widely affected the distribution of Pur-alpha and its 
      binding partner fragile X mental retardation protein 1 (FMRP, also known as 
      FMR1), which accumulate in intra-cytosolic granules that are positive for stress 
      granules markers. Accordingly, translational repression is induced. 
      Interestingly, this effect is associated with a marked accumulation of poly(A) 
      mRNAs in cell nuclei. Thus, defective trafficking of mRNA, as a consequence of 
      impaired nuclear mRNA export, might affect translation efficiency and contribute 
      to the pathogenesis of C9orf72 ALS.

AB  - Recently developed PCR-based methods for fragile X syndrome testing are often 
      regarded as screening tools because of a reduced reliance on Southern blot 
      analysis. However, existing PCR methods rely essentially on capillary 
      electrophoresis for the analysis of amplicons. These methods not only require an 
      expensive capillary electrophoresis instrument but also involve post-PCR 
      processing steps. Here, we evaluated a commercially available PCR-based assay 
      that uses melt curve analysis as a screening tool for the rapid detection of CGG 
      repeat expansions in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. On the basis 
      of testing with well-characterized DNA samples, the assay gave a detection limit 
      of 10 ng per reaction and an analytic specificity beyond 150 ng per reaction. 
      Furthermore, the melt temperatures critical for result interpretation were found 
      to be closely linked to the CGG expansion lengths with great consistency (CV < 
      0.55%). The clinical performance of the assay was established with 528 blinded 
      and previously analyzed clinical samples, yielding results of 100% sensitivity 
      (95% CI, 91.0%-100%) and 99.6% specificity (95% CI, 98.5%-99.9%) in detecting 
      expansions >55 CGG repeats in FMR1. This new approach eliminates post-PCR 
      handling for all non-expanded samples, and exemplifies a truly efficient 
      screening procedure.

TI  - Characterization and Early Detection of Balance Deficits in Fragile X Premutation 
      Carriers With and Without Fragile X-Associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS).
PG  - 650-62
LID - 10.1007/s12311-015-0659-7 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) results from a "premutation" 
      size 55-200 CGG repeat expansion in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) 
      gene. Core motor features include cerebellar gait ataxia and kinetic tremor, 
      resulting in progressive mobility disability. There are no published studies 
      characterizing balance deficits in FMR1 premutation carriers with and without 
      FXTAS using a battery of quantitative measures to test the sensory integration 
      underlying postural control, automatic postural reflexes, and dynamic postural 
      stability limits. Computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) and two 
      performance-based balance measures were administered in 44 premutation carriers, 
      21 with FXTAS and 23 without FXTAS, and 42 healthy controls to compare balance 
      and functional mobility between these groups. Relationships between FMR1 
      molecular variables, age, and sex and CDP scores were explored. FXTAS subjects 
      demonstrated significantly lower scores on the sensory organization test (with 
      greatest reductions in the vestibular control of balance), longer response 
      latencies to balance perturbations, and reduced stability limits compared to 
      controls. Premutation carriers without FXTAS also demonstrated significantly 
      delayed response latencies and disrupted sensory weighting for balance control. 
      Advancing age, male sex, increased CGG repeat size, and reduced X activation of 
      the normal allele in premutation carrier women predicted balance dysfunction. 
      These postural control deficits in carriers with and without FXTAS implicate 
      dysfunctional cerebellar neural networks and may provide valuable outcome markers 
      for tailored rehabilitative interventions. Our findings suggest that CDP may 
      provide sensitive measures for early detection of postural control impairments in 
      at-risk carriers and better characterize balance dysfunction and progression in 
      FXTAS.

TI  - The transcription-coupled repair protein ERCC6/CSB also protects against repeat 
      expansion in a mouse model of the fragile X premutation.
PG  - 482-7
LID - 10.1002/humu.22777 [doi]
AB  - The fragile X-related disorders (FXDs) are members of the group of diseases known 
      as the repeat expansion diseases. The FXDs result from expansion of an unstable 
      CGG/CCG repeat tract in the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene. Contractions are also seen, 
      albeit at lower frequency. We have previously shown that ERCC6/CSB plays an 
      auxiliary role in promoting germ line and somatic expansions in a mouse model of 
      the FXDs. However, work in model systems of other repeat expansion diseases has 
      suggested that CSB may protect against expansions by promoting contractions. 
      Since FXD mice normally have such a high expansion frequency, it is possible that 
      such a protective effect would have been masked. We thus examined the effect of 
      the loss of CSB in an Msh2(+/-) background where the germ line expansion 
      frequency is reduced and in an Msh2(-/-) background where expansions do not 
      occur, but contractions do. Our data show that in addition to promoting repeat 
      expansion, CSB does in fact protect the genome from germ line expansions in the 
      FXD mouse model. However, it likely does so not by promoting contractions but by 
      promoting an error-free process that preserves the parental allele.

TI  - A novel fragile X syndrome mutation reveals a conserved role for the 
      carboxy-terminus in FMRP localization and function.
PG  - 423-37
LID - 10.15252/emmm.201404576 [doi]
AB  - Loss of function of the FMR1 gene leads to fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most 
      common form of intellectual disability. The loss of FMR1 function is usually 
      caused by epigenetic silencing of the FMR1 promoter leading to expansion and 
      subsequent methylation of a CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region. Very few 
      coding sequence variations have been experimentally characterized and shown to be 
      causal to the disease. Here, we describe a novel FMR1 mutation and reveal an 
      unexpected nuclear export function for the C-terminus of FMRP. We screened a 
      cohort of patients with typical FXS symptoms who tested negative for CGG repeat 
      expansion in the FMR1 locus. In one patient, we identified a guanine insertion in 
      FMR1 exon 15. This mutation alters the open reading frame creating a short novel 
      C-terminal sequence, followed by a stop codon. We find that this novel peptide 
      encodes a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) targeting the patient FMRP 
      to the nucleolus in human cells. We also reveal an evolutionarily conserved 
      nuclear export function associated with the endogenous C-terminus of FMRP. In 
      vivo analyses in Drosophila demonstrate that a patient-mimetic mutation alters 
      the localization and function of Dfmrp in neurons, leading to neomorphic neuronal 
      phenotypes.

TI  - Preliminary evidence of an effect of cerebellar volume on postural sway in FMR1 
      premutation males.

LID - 10.1111/gbb.12204 [doi]
AB  - Recent evidence suggests that early changes in postural control may be 
      discernible among females with premutation expansions (55-200 CGG repeats) of the 
      fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene at risk of developing fragile 
      X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Cerebellar dysfunction is well 
      described in males and females with FXTAS, yet the interrelationships between 
      cerebellar volume, CGG repeat length, FMR1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels and 
      changes in postural control remain unknown. This study examined postural sway 
      during standing in a cohort of 22 males with the FMR1 premutation (ages 26-80) 
      and 24 matched controls (ages 26-77). The influence of cerebellar volume, CGG 
      repeat length and FMR1 mRNA levels on postural sway was explored using multiple 
      linear regression. The results provide preliminary evidence that increasing CGG 
      repeat length and decreasing cerebellar volume were associated with greater 
      postural sway among premutation males. The relationship between CGG repeat length 
      and postural sway was mediated by a negative association between CGG repeat size 
      and cerebellar volume. While FMR1 mRNA levels were significantly elevated in the 
      premutation group and correlated with CGG repeat length, FMR1 mRNA levels were 
      not significantly associated with postural sway scores. These findings show for 
      the first time that greater postural sway among males with the FMR1 premutation 
      may reflect CGG repeat-mediated disruption in vulnerable cerebellar circuits 
      implicated in postural control. However, longitudinal studies in larger samples 
      are required to confirm whether the relationships between cerebellar volume, CGG 
      repeat length and postural sway indicate greater risk for neurological decline.

TI  - Distribution of AGG interruption patterns within nine world populations.
PG  - 153-61
LID - 10.5582/irdr.2014.01028 [doi]
AB  - The CGG trinucleotide repeat within the FMR1 gene is associated with multiple 
      clinical disorders, including fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, 
      fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency, and fragile X syndrome. 
      Differences in the distribution and prevalence of CGG repeat length and of AGG 
      interruption patterns have been reported among different populations and 
      ethnicities. In this study we characterized the AGG interruption patterns within 
      3,065 normal CGG repeat alleles from nine world populations including Australia, 
      Chile, United Arab Emirates, Guatemala, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, Spain, and 
      United States. Additionally, we compared these populations with those previously 
      reported, and summarized the similarities and differences. We observed 
      significant differences in AGG interruption patterns. Frequencies of longer 
      alleles, longer uninterrupted CGG repeat segments and alleles with greater than 2 
      AGG interruptions varied between cohorts. The prevalence of fragile X syndrome 
      and FMR1 associated disorders in various populations is thought to be affected by 
      the total length of the CGG repeat and may also be influenced by the AGG 
      distribution pattern. Thus, the results of this study may be important in 
      considering the risk of fragile X-related conditions in various populations.

TI  - Molecular Advances Leading to Treatment Implications for Fragile X Premutation 
      Carriers.
LID - 1000119 [pii]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common single gene cause of intellectual 
      disability and it is characterized by a CGG expansion of more than 200 repeats in 
      the FMR1 gene, leading to methylation of the promoter and gene silencing. The 
      fragile X premutation, characterized by a 55 to 200 CGG repeat expansion, causes 
      health problems and developmental difficulties in some, but not all, carriers. 
      The premutation causes primary ovarian insufficiency in approximately 20% of 
      females, psychiatric problems (including depression and/or anxiety) in 
      approximately 50% of carriers and a neurodegenerative disorder, the fragile 
      X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), in approximately 40% of males and 
      16% of females later in life. Recent clinical studies in premutation carriers 
      have expanded the health problems that may be seen. Advances in the molecular 
      pathogenesis of the premutation have shown significant mitochondrial dysfunction 
      and oxidative stress in neurons which may be amenable to treatment. Here we 
      review the clinical problems of carriers and treatment recommendations.

PG  - 190-7
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.36748 [doi]
AB  - Premutation alleles in fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) can cause the 
      late-onset neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor ataxia 
      syndrome (FXTAS) and/or the fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency in 
      approximately 20% of heterozygotes. Heterozygotes of the FMR1 premutation have a 
      higher incidence of immune mediated disorders such as autoimmune thyroid 
      disorder, especially when accompanied by FXTAS motor signs. We describe the time 
      course of symptoms of immune mediated disorders and the subsequent development of 
      FXTAS in four women with an FMR1 CGG expansion, including three with the 
      premutation and one with a gray zone expansion. These patients developed an 
      immune mediated disorder followed by neurological symptoms that become consistent 
      with FXTAS. In all patients we observed a pattern involving an initial appearance 
      of disease symptoms-often after a period of heightened stress (depression, 
      anxiety, divorce, general surgery) followed by the onset of tremor and/or ataxia. 
      Immune mediated diseases are associated with the manifestations of FXTAS 
      temporally, although further studies are needed to clarify this association. If a 
      cause and effect relationship can be established, treatment of pre-existing 
      immune mediated disorders may benefit patients with pathogenic FMR1 mutations.

TI  - FMR1 gene mutation screening by TP-PCR in patients with premature ovarian failure

PG  - 191-5
LID - 10.3109/09513590.2014.975685 [doi]
AB  - CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene is associated with fragile X syndrome, 
      fragile X-associated tremor/ ataxia syndrome and fragile X-associated primary 
      ovarian insufficiency. In this study, FMR1 gene mutation screening was carried 
      out in 50 patients. Among them, 12 (%24) were POF and 19 (%38) were Fragile-X. We 
      also examined the parents of the Fragile-X patients. DNA was extracted from blood 
      with kit procedure. To examine expansion of the fragile-X CGG repeat, TP-PCR 
      assay was performed and all amplicons were evaluated on an ABI3130XL Genetic 
      Analyzer System by Fragman analysis. The data were analyzed by Gene Mapper 
      Program. As a result of this study, the patients were identified with the 
      fragile-X whose FMR1 gene CGG alleles have been observed in normal range. 
      However, in patients who were referred with premature ovarian failure, 
      pre-mutation frequency was observed as 6.6%. Only limited study in Turkish 
      population reported frequency of pre-mutation carrier in POF and Fragile-X. 
      Detection of pre-mutation carrier is important for next generation to have 
      healthy siblings. We emphasize that TP-PCR technique is clear, reliable, 
      sensitive, easy and fast method to detect pre-mutation. However, full mutations 
      have to be examined by the technique of Southern blot in the diagnosis of 
      fragile-X.

AB  - In a sample of post-menopausal premutation carrier mothers of children with the 
      full mutation of fragile X syndrome (n = 88), this study examined the 
      co-occurrence of the reproductive and psychiatric phenotypes associated with FMR1 
      premutations. Mean age at menopause was 43.1 years, and 35.2% of premutation 
      carriers reported cessation of menses prior to age 40 (premature ovarian 
      failure), but only 18% of carriers had been medically diagnosed by a physician as 
      having Fragile X-associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency. There was a 
      significant curvilinear association between CGG repeat length and age at 
      menopause, with women who had mid-range repeats having the earliest menopause, 
      similar to the pattern that has been found for the psychiatric phenotype of the 
      FMR1 premutation.

AB  - The (CGG)n-repeat in the 5'-untranslated region of the fragile X mental 
      retardation gene (FMR1) gene is polymorphic and may become unstable on 
      transmission to the next generation. In fragile X syndrome, CGG repeat lengths 
      exceed 200, resulting in silencing of FMR1 and absence of its protein product, 
      fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). CGG repeat lengths between 55 and 
      200 occur in fragile X premutation (FXPM) carriers and have a high risk of 
      expansion to a full mutation on maternal transmission. FXPM carriers have an 
      increased risk for developing progressive neurodegenerative syndromes and 
      neuropsychological symptoms. FMR1 mRNA levels are elevated in FXPM, and it is 
      thought that clinical symptoms might be caused by a toxic gain of function due to 
      elevated FMR1 mRNA. Paradoxically, FMRP levels decrease moderately with 
      increasing CGG repeat length in FXPM. Lowered FMRP levels may also contribute to 
      the appearance of clinical problems. We previously reported increases in regional 
      rates of cerebral protein synthesis (rCPS) in the absence of FMRP in an Fmr1 
      knockout mouse model and in a FXPM knockin (KI) mouse model with 120 to 140 CGG 
      repeats in which FMRP levels are profoundly reduced (80%-90%). To explore whether 
      the concentration of FMRP contributes to the rCPS changes, we measured rCPS in 
      another FXPM KI model with a similar CGG repeat length and a 50% reduction in 
      FMRP. In all 24 brain regions examined, rCPS were unaffected. These results 
      suggest that even with 50% reductions in FMRP, normal protein synthesis rates are 
      maintained.

LID - 318
AB  - Expansions of more than 200 CGG repeats (full mutation) in the FMR1 gene give 
      rise to fragile X syndrome (FXS) through a process that generally involves 
      hypermethylation of the FMR1 promoter region and gene silencing, resulting in 
      absence of expression of the encoded protein, FMRP. However, mosaicism with 
      alleles differing in size and extent of methylation often exist within or between 
      tissues of individuals with FXS. In the current work, CGG-repeat lengths and 
      methylation status were assessed for eighteen individuals with FXS, including 13 
      mosaics, for which peripheral blood cells (PBMCs) and primary fibroblast cells 
      were available. Our results show that for both PBMCs and fibroblasts, FMR1 mRNA 
      and FMRP expression are directly correlated with the percent of methylation of 
      the FMR1 allele. In addition, Full Scale IQ scores were inversely correlated with 
      the percent methylation and positively correlated with higher FMRP expression. 
      These latter results point toward a positive impact on cognition for full 
      mutation mosaics with lower methylation compared to individuals with fully 
      methylated, full mutation alleles. However, we did not observe a significant 
      reduction in the number of seizures, nor in the severity of hyperactivity or 
      autism spectrum disorder, among individuals with mosaic genotypes in the 
      presentation of FXS. These observations suggest that low, but non-zero expression 
      of FMRP may be sufficient to positively impact cognitive function in individuals 
      with FXS, with methylation mosaicism (lowered methylation fraction) contributing 
      to a more positive clinical outcome.

LID - 309
AB  - This population-based study investigates genotype-phenotype correlations of "low- 
      normal" CGG repeats in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. FMR1 plays 
      an important role in brain development and function, and encodes FMRP (fragile X 
      mental retardation protein), an RNA-binding protein that regulates protein 
      synthesis impacting activity-dependent synaptic development and plasticity. Most 
      past research has focused on CGG premutation expansions (41-200 CGG repeats) and 
      on fragile X syndrome (200+ CGG repeats), with considerably less attention on the 
      other end of the spectrum of CGG repeats. Using existing data, older adults with 
      23 or fewer CGG repeats (2 SDs below the mean) were compared with age-peers who 
      have normal numbers of CGGs (24-40) with respect to cognition, mental health, 
      cancer, and having children with disabilities. Men (n = 341 with an allele in the 
      low-normal range) and women (n = 46 with two low-normal alleles) had 
      significantly more difficulty with their memory and ability to solve day to day 
      problems. Women with both FMR1 alleles in the low-normal category had 
      significantly elevated odds of feeling that they need to drink more to get the 
      same effect as in the past. These women also had two and one-half times the odds 
      of having had breast cancer and four times the odds of uterine cancer. Men and 
      women with low-normal CGGs had higher odds of having a child with a disability, 
      either a developmental disability or a mental health condition. These findings 
      are in line with the hypothesis that there is a need for tight neuronal 
      homeostatic control mechanisms for optimal cognitive and behavioral functioning, 
      and more generally that low numbers as well as high numbers of CGG repeats may be 
      problematic for health.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by CGG repeat expansion that leads to FMR1 
      silencing. Women with a premutation allele are at risk of having a full mutation 
      child with FXS. To investigate the mechanism of repeat expansion, we examined the 
      relationship between a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant that is 
      linked to repeat expansion in haplogroup D and a replication origin located  approximately 53 
      kb upstream of the repeats. This origin is absent in FXS human embryonic stem 
      cells (hESCs), which have the SNP variant C, but present in the nonaffected 
      hESCs, which have a T variant. The SNP maps directly within the replication 
      origin. Interestingly, premutation hESCs have a replication origin and the T 
      variant similar to nonaffected hESCs. These results suggest that a T/C SNP 
      located at a replication origin could contribute to the inactivation of this 
      replication origin in FXS hESCs, leading to altered replication fork progression 
      through the repeats, which could result in repeat expansion to the FXS full 
      mutation.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common cause of intellectual disability, 
      developmental delay and autism spectrum disorders. This syndrome is due to a 
      functional loss of the FMR1 gene product FMRP, and, in most cases, it is caused 
      by CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 promoter. Yet, also other FMR1 mutations may 
      cause a FXS-like phenotype. Since standard molecular testing does not include the 
      analysis of the FMR1 coding region, the prevalence of point mutations causing FXS 
      is not well known. Here, high resolution melting (HRM) was used to screen for 
      FMR1 gene mutations in 508 males with clinical signs of mental retardation and 
      developmental delay, but without CGG and GCC repeat expansions in the FMR1 gene 
      and AFF2 genes, respectively. Sequence variations were identified by HRM analysis 
      and verified by direct DNA sequencing. Two novel missense mutations (p.Gly482Ser 
      in one patient and p.Arg534His in two unrelated patients), one intronic and two 
      3'-untranslated region (UTR) variations were identified in the FMR1 gene. 
      Missense mutations in the FMR1 gene might account for a considerable proportion 
      of cases in male patients with FXS-related symptoms, such as those linked to 
      mental retardation and developmental delay.

AB  - Whereas full mutation CGG-repeat expansions (>200 repeats) of the fragile X gene 
      (FMR1) give rise to the neurodevelopmental disorder, fragile X syndrome (FXS); 
      smaller, 'premutation' expansions (55 to 200 repeats) are now gaining increasing 
      recognition as the basis for a spectrum of clinical involvement, from 
      neurodevelopmental problems; to mid-adult disorders, such as primary ovarian 
      insufficiency and mood and psychiatric disorders; to the late-adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). 
      The premutation disorders are thought to arise through a molecular mechanism 
      involving toxicity of the elevated levels of expanded CGG-repeat mRNA ('RNA 
      toxicity'), a process that is entirely distinct from the FMR1 protein-deficiency 
      that gives rise to FXS. However, despite the importance of the spectrum of 
      clinical disorders associated with the premutation, and a high prevalence rate (1 
      in 130 to 250 females and 1 in 250 to 810 males), relatively little attention has 
      been paid to these disorders and there is a general lack of awareness among 
      clinicians as to the distinction between the premutation disorders and FXS. To 
      address this lack of awareness, an international conference on the premutation 
      was held in Perugia, Italy, in June 2013. The conference covered the expanding 
      range of clinical involvement, refinements of the assessments and tools for 
      characterizing such involvement, and the rapidly expanding understanding of the 
      pathogenic molecular and cellular mechanisms that give rise to the spectrum of 
      involvement among premutation carriers. All of these advances support ongoing 
      efforts to develop new targeted treatments for the premutation disorders. As an 
      outgrowth of the meeting, papers were solicited from the conference attendees 
      such that groups of scientists and clinicians would develop works that broadly 
      covered the topics of the meeting. The following papers represent that effort.

TI  - Approaches to identify genetic variants that influence the risk for onset of 
      fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI): a preliminary study.
PG  - 260

LID - 260
AB  - Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) is due to an X-linked 
      mutation that results from the expansion of a CGG repeat sequence located in the 
      5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene (premutation, PM). About 20% of women who 
      carry the PM have cessation of menses before age 40, a clinical condition known 
      as premature ovarian failure (POF). This leads to a 20-fold increased risk over 
      women in the general population. Thus, this single gene mutation has a major 
      effect on reducing a woman's reproductive life span. Based on survival analysis 
      of about 1300 women, we showed that the mean age at menopause among PM carriers 
      is reduced compared with noncarriers, even after removing women who reported POF. 
      This suggests that the majority of women with the PM, not just a subset, 
      experience ovarian insufficiency earlier than noncarriers. To better understand 
      the underlying mechanism of the PM and to identify genes that modify the variable 
      expressivity of FXPOI, we conducted two pilot studies. The first focused on five 
      common variants known to reduce age at menopause. We genotyped these SNPs in 72 
      women with a PM who experienced menopause and found a significant association 
      with the total SNP risk burden and age at menopause. This suggests that these 
      SNPs influence onset of FXPOI, after adjusting for the effect of the PM allele. 
      In the second approach, we conducted whole genome sequencing on 10 PM carriers, 
      five with onset of FXPOI prior to age 30 and five who experienced menopause after 
      age 47 years. Although only a pilot study, we describe our preliminary approach 
      to identify potential variants that may play a role in modifying onset of FXPOI 
      and potentially play a role in idiopathic primary ovarian insufficiency. The 
      overarching goal of both approaches is to identify predictor variants that may 
      identify women predisposed to early onset FXPOI and to further identify genes 
      involved in defining a woman's reproductive life span.

TI  - AGG interruptions and maternal age affect FMR1 CGG repeat allele stability during 
      transmission.
PG  - 24
LID - 10.1186/1866-1955-6-24 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of AGG interruptions in the CGG repeat locus of the 
      fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene decreases the instability of the 
      allele during transmission from parent to child, and decreases the risk of 
      expansion of a premutation allele to a full mutation allele (the predominant 
      cause of fragile X syndrome) during maternal transmission. METHODS: To strengthen 
      recent findings on the utility of AGG interruptions in predicting instability or 
      expansion to a full mutation of FMR1 CGG repeat alleles, we assessed the outcomes 
      of 108 intermediate (also named gray zone) and 710 premutation alleles that were 
      transmitted from parent to child, and collected from four international clinical 
      sites. We have used the results to revise our initial model that predicted the 
      risk of a maternal premutation allele expanding to a full mutation during 
      transmission and to test the effect of AGG interruptions on the magnitude of 
      expanded allele instability of intermediate or premutation alleles that did not 
      expand to a full mutation. RESULTS: Consistent with previous studies, the number 
      of AGG triplets that interrupts the CGG repeat locus was found to influence the 
      risk of allele instability, including expansion to a full mutation. The total 
      length of the CGG repeat allele remains the best predictor of instability or 
      expansion to a full mutation, but the number of AGG interruptions and, to a much 
      lesser degree, maternal age are also factors when considering the risk of 
      transmission of the premutation allele to a full mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings demonstrate that a model with total CGG length, number of AGG 
      interruptions, and maternal age is recommended for calculating the risk of 
      expansion to a full mutation during maternal transmission. Taken together, the 
      results of this study provide relevant information for the genetic counseling of 
      female premutation carriers, and improve the current predictive models which 
      calculate risk of expansion to a full mutation using only total CGG repeat 
      length.

TI  - Visual motion processing deficits in infants with the fragile X premutation.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1186/1866-1955-6-29 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from a trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion (full mutation >200 cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) repeats) in the FMR1 
      gene, leading to a reduction or absence of the gene's protein product, fragile X 
      mental retardation protein (FMRP), ultimately causing cognitive and behavioral 
      impairments that are characteristic of the syndrome. In our previous work with 
      infants and toddlers with FXS, we have been able to describe much about their 
      cognitive and visual processing abilities. In light of recent work on the mild 
      cognitive deficits and functional and structural brain differences that are 
      present in adults with the fragile X (FX) premutation, in the present study we 
      examined whether some of the low-level visual processing deficits we have 
      observed in infants with FXS would also be present in infants with the FX 
      premutation (55-200 CGG repeats). METHODS: We chose a contrast detection task 
      using second-order motion stimuli on which infants with FXS previously showed 
      significantly increased detection thresholds (Vision Res 48:1471-1478, 2008). 
      Critically, we also included a developmental delay comparison group of infants 
      with Down syndrome (DS), who were matched to infants with FXS on both 
      chronological and mental age, to speak to the question of whether this 
      second-order motion processing deficit is a FX-specific phenomenon. RESULTS: As 
      reported previously, infants with the FX full mutation showed motion contrast 
      detection threshold levels that were significantly higher than age-matched 
      typically developing control infants. Strikingly, the motion detection contrast 
      levels of FX premutation infants were also significantly higher than typically 
      developing (TD) infants and not significantly different from the group of infants 
      with FXS or with DS. CONCLUSIONS: These results, which are in keeping with a 
      growing body of evidence on the mild cognitive and perceptual processing deficits 
      and functional and structural brain differences that are present in adults and 
      older children with the FX premutation, underscore the pressing need to study and 
      describe the processing capabilities of infants and toddlers with the FX 
      premutation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a clinically 
      heterogeneous disorder characterized predominantly by tremor, followed by late 
      onset gait ataxia, autonomic dysfunction and/or cognitive impairment. We aimed to 
      screen FMR1-CGG repeats in our cohort of progressive late-onset cerebellar 
      ataxia/tremor cohort to characterize the occurrence of FXTAS in India. METHODS: 
      We have screened FMR1-CGG repeats in 109 patients and 173 healthy control 
      subjects. Our cohort comprised: a)group of patients with predominant cerebellar 
      ataxia and/or tremor. b.)suspected cases of MSA and c.)patients who presented 
      SCA12-like neurological manifestations (late onset predominant tremor and/or 
      ataxia). All the cases were ruled out for known triplet-repeat-expansion (TRE) 
      SCA mutations. RESULTS: We have found three FMR1-premutation carriers among the 
      cases. Two of them (with CGG-96 and CGG-102) were under evaluation for their 
      SCA12-like manifestations and another (CGG-78) had progressive gait ataxia. 
      Overall the frequency of FXTAS in our cohort was found to be 3.3% among cases of 
      late onset cerebellar-ataxia/tremor; however, incidences were higher among cases 
      with SCA12-like syndrome (9%, 2/23). CONCLUSION: Finding FXTAS in patients with 
      SCA12-like manifestation suggests that TRE in the 5'UTR of the gene is the common 
      cue connecting two disorders with common phenotype of tremor/ataxia. This 
      knowledge might shed light upon their sharing of molecular neuropathology.

AB  - Fragile X-associated disorders (FXD) are a group of disorders caused by expansion 
      of non-coding CGG repeat elements in the fragile X (FMR1) gene. One of these 
      disorders, fragile X syndrome (FXS), is the most common heritable cause of 
      intellectual disability, and is caused by large CGG repeat expansions (>200) 
      resulting in silencing of the FMR1 gene. An increasingly recognized number of 
      neuropsychiatric FXD have recently been identified that are caused by 
      'premutation' range expansions (55-200). These disorders are characterized by a 
      spectrum of neuropsychiatric manifestations ranging from an increased risk of 
      neurodevelopmental, mood and anxiety disorders to neurodegenerative phenotypes 
      such as the fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Here, we review 
      advances in the clinical understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders in 
      premutation carriers across the lifespan and offer guidance for the detection of 
      such disorders by practicing psychiatrists and neurologists.

LID - 10.1038/npp.2014.167 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene that codes for fragile X mental 
      retardation protein (FMRP). To determine if FMRP expression in the central 
      nervous system could reverse phenotypic deficits in the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse 
      model of FXS, we used a single-stranded adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector with 
      viral capsids from serotype 9 that contained a major isoform of FMRP. FMRP 
      transgene expression was driven by the neuron-selective synapsin-1 promoter. The 
      vector was delivered to the brain via a single bilateral intracerebroventricular 
      injection into neonatal Fmr1 KO mice and transgene expression and behavioral 
      assessments were conducted 22-26 or 50-56 days post injection. Western blotting 
      and immunocytochemical analyses of AAV-FMRP-injected mice revealed FMRP 
      expression in the striatum, hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, and cingulate 
      cortex. Cellular expression was selective for neurons and reached  approximately  50% of 
      wild-type levels in the hippocampus and cortex at 56 days post injection. The 
      pathologically elevated repetitive behavior and the deficit in social dominance 
      behavior seen in phosphate-buffered saline-injected Fmr1 KO mice were reversed in 
      AAV-FMRP-injected mice. These results provide the first proof of principle that 
      gene therapy can correct specific behavioral abnormalities in the mouse model of 
      FXS.

AB  - CGG repeat expansion is the most common cause of fragile X syndrome. Numerous 
      efforts have been made to identify novel mutations in patients with intellectual 
      disability, developmental delay, and/or autism. To evaluate the mutational 
      spectrum in the at-risk Chinese population, 60 pediatric patients presenting 
      fragile X traits but normal-sized CGG repeats were sequenced for all 17 exons and 
      regulatory regions in FMR1. A c.879A>C mutation, reported to alter a neighboring 
      splicing, was detected in a severely retarded male and his normal mother. 
      However, the exon junction appears unaffected. A 237-kb deletion covering the 
      entire FMR1 was identified to cause moderate intellectual disability and marked 
      hyperactivity in an 8-year-old boy. The 5' and 3' breakpoints were buried in the 
      surrounding long interspersed and short interspersed elements, respectively. In 
      general, missense mutations do not commonly cause fragile X syndrome, whereas 
      deletions should be considered with caution in patient referrals presenting with 
      developmental delay and/or ordinary retardation.

TI  - AMH in women with diminished ovarian reserve: potential differences by FMR1 CGG 
      repeat level.
PG  - 1295-301
LID - 10.1007/s10815-014-0276-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We explored whether AMH, as a surrogate for oocyte supply, varies by 
      FMR1 genotype in women diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), a subset 
      of the Primary Ovarian Insufficiency phenotype. Research is inconsistent on the 
      relationship between AMH and FMR1 repeat length, controlling for age. METHOD: 
      Seventy-nine cycling women diagnosed with DOR, and without a family history of 
      fragile X syndrome, provided blood for FMR1 and AMH testing. DOR was defined as 
      elevated FSH and/or low AMH and/or low antral follicle count, with regular 
      menses. FMR1 CGG repeats were stratified by the larger allele <35 repeats 
      (n = 70) v. >/=35 repeats (n = 9). Quadratic and linear models were fit to predict 
      log (AMH) controlling for age. The AMH sample used as the outcome variable was 
      drawn at a later date than the diagnostic AMH. RESULTS: Serum AMH concentration 
      median was 0.30 ng/mL; Ages ranged from 26-43 years. A quadratic model (including 
      age(2)) did not show a relationship with FMR1 CGG level (p-value = 0.25). A 
      linear model of log (AMH), corresponding to an exponential decline of AMH with 
      increasing age, was significantly different, and had a steeper slope, for women 
      with >/= 35 CGG repeats than women with < 35 repeats (p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: 
      Findings suggest a greater rate of follicular loss that starts at later ages in 
      women with DOR and >/= 35 CGG repeats.

TI  - TDP-43 suppresses CGG repeat-induced neurotoxicity through interactions with 
      HnRNP A2/B1.
PG  - 5036-51
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddu216 [doi]
AB  - Nucleotide repeat expansions can elicit neurodegeneration as RNA by sequestering 
      specific RNA-binding proteins, preventing them from performing their normal 
      functions. Conversely, mutations in RNA-binding proteins can trigger 
      neurodegeneration at least partly by altering RNA metabolism. In Fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), a CGG repeat expansion in the 5'UTR 
      of the fragile X gene (FMR1) leads to progressive neurodegeneration in patients 
      and CGG repeats in isolation elicit toxicity in Drosophila and other animal 
      models. Here, we identify the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated 
      RNA-binding protein TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) as a suppressor of CGG 
      repeat-induced toxicity in a Drosophila model of FXTAS. The rescue appears 
      specific to TDP-43, as co-expression of another ALS-associated RNA-binding 
      protein, FUS, exacerbates the toxic effects of CGG repeats. Suppression of CGG 
      RNA toxicity was abrogated by disease-associated mutations in TDP-43. TDP-43 does 
      not co-localize with CGG RNA foci and its ability to bind RNA is not required for 
      rescue. TDP-43-dependent rescue does, however, require fly hnRNP A2/B1 homologues 
      Hrb87F and Hrb98DE. Deletions in the C-terminal domain of TDP-43 that preclude 
      interactions with hnRNP A2/B1 abolish TDP-43-dependent rescue of CGG repeat 
      toxicity. In contrast, suppression of CGG repeat toxicity by hnRNP A2/B1 is not 
      affected by RNAi-mediated knockdown of the fly TDP-43 orthologue, TBPH. Lastly, 
      TDP-43 suppresses CGG repeat-triggered mis-splicing of an hnRNP A2/B1-targeted 
      transcript. These data support a model in which TDP-43 suppresses CGG-mediated 
      toxicity through interactions with hnRNP A2/B1 and suggest a convergence of 
      pathogenic cascades between repeat expansion disorders and RNA-binding proteins 
      implicated in neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Excessive triple CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene have been widely associated with 
      premature ovarian failure. The number of AGG interruptions and length of 
      uninterrupted CGG repeats have been correlated with repeat instability on 
      transmission. In this study, FMR1 CGG repeats and AGG interruption status were 
      determined by triplet-primed PCR in 117 premature ovarian failure patients and 82 
      matched controls. A possible relationship between CGG repeats or AGG interruption 
      and serum FSH concentrations in patients and controls was evaluated. One patient 
      had a premutation allele (73 repeats) (1/117), while no such mutations were 
      observed in controls (0/82). Other patients and all controls had CGG repeats in 
      the normal range. There was no significant difference in the incidence of 
      intermediate mutations of CGG repeats between patients and controls and no 
      relationship between CGG repeats with serum FSH concentrations. Interestingly, 
      more individuals with premature ovarian failure carried no AGG interruptions than 
      the controls (4.27% versus 1.83%) but statistical significance was not reached. 
      This small case-control study failed to find associations between CGG repeat 
      sizes or AGG interruptions in FMR1 and premature ovarian failure in Chinese 
      women. Further study with large sample size is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common monogenic form of 
      intellectual disability and one of the few known monogenic causes of autism. It 
      is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 ('Fragile X Mental 
      Retardation 1') gene, which prevents expression of the 'Fragile X Mental 
      Retardation Protein' (FMRP). In FXS, the absence of FMRP leads to altered 
      structural and functional development of the synapse, while preventing 
      activity-based synapse maturation and synaptic pruning, which are essential for 
      normal brain development and cognitive development. Possible impairments in 
      information processing can be non-invasively investigated using 
      electrophysiology. METHODS: We compared auditory (AEP) and visual (VEP) evoked 
      potentials in twelve adolescents and young adults (10-22 years) affected by FXS 
      to healthy controls matched by chronological age (N=12) and developmental age of 
      cognitive functioning (N=9; 5-7 years), using analysis of variance. RESULTS: In 
      the visual modality, the N70 and N2 amplitude have been found increased in FXS in 
      comparison to the chronological, but not the developmental control group at 
      occipital sites, whereas in the auditory modality N1, P2 and N2 amplitude as well 
      as N2 latency have been found increased in FXS, relative to both chronological 
      and developmental control groups at mid-central sites. CONCLUSIONS: The AEP/VEP 
      profile suggests disruptions in sensory processing specific to FXS that exceed 
      immaturity of physiological activity. In addition, the auditory modality seems to 
      be more affected than the visual modality. Results are discussed in light of 
      possible underlying neuronal mechanisms, including deficits in synaptic pruning 
      and neuronal inhibition that might account for a hyperreactive nervous system in 
      FXS.

TI  - X inactivation plays a major role in the gender bias in somatic expansion in a 
      mouse model of the fragile X-related disorders: implications for the mechanism of 
      repeat expansion.
PG  - 4985-94

AB  - The Fragile X-related disorders are X-linked disorders resulting from the 
      inheritance of FMR1 alleles with >54 CGG/CCG repeats in their 5' UTR. The repeats 
      expand both somatically and on intergenerational transmission and increased 
      repeat numbers are associated with increased risk of disease and increased risk 
      of further expansion. The mechanism responsible for expansion is unknown. Here, 
      we show in a knockin mouse model of these disorders that somatic expansion is 
      much less common in females than in males. We show that this is due in large part 
      to the fact that expansions occur only when the repeat is on the active X 
      chromosome. However, even when this is taken into account, expansions in females 
      are still less common than expected. This additional gender effect is not due to 
      a protective effect of estrogen, a deleterious effect of testosterone or to 
      differences in the expression of the Fmr1 gene or a variety of X-linked and 
      autosomal DNA repair genes. However, our data do suggest that a higher level of 
      expression of genes that protect against oxidative damage in females may 
      contribute to their lower levels of expansion. Whatever the basis, our data 
      suggest that the risk for somatic expansion may be lower in women than it is in 
      men. This could help explain the reduced penetrance of some aspects of disease 
      pathology in women. The fact that expansion only occurs when the Fmr1 allele is 
      on the active X chromosome has important implications for the mechanism of repeat 
      expansion.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a severe neurodegenerative 
      disorder that affects carriers of premutation CGG-repeat expansion alleles of the 
      fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene; current evidence supports a causal 
      role of the expanded CGG repeat within the FMR1 mRNA in the pathogenesis of 
      FXTAS. Though the mRNA has been observed to induce cellular toxicity in FXTAS, 
      the mechanisms are unclear. One common neurophysiological characteristic of FXTAS 
      patients is their inability to properly attenuate their response to an auditory 
      stimulus upon receipt of a small pre-stimulus. Therefore, to gain genetic and 
      cell biological insight into FXTAS, we examined the effect of expanded CGG 
      repeats on the plasticity of the olfactory response of the genetically tractable 
      nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). While C. elegans is innately 
      attracted to odors, this response can be downregulated if the odor is paired with 
      starvation. We found that expressing expanded CGG repeats in olfactory neurons 
      interfered with this plasticity without affecting either the innate odor-seeking 
      response or the olfactory neuronal morphology. Interrogation of three RNA 
      regulatory pathways indicated that the expanded CGG repeats act via the C. 
      elegans microRNA (miRNA)-specific Argonaute ALG-2 to diminish olfactory 
      plasticity. This observation suggests that the miRNA-Argonaute pathway may play a 
      pathogenic role in subverting neuronal function in FXTAS.

AB  - The human genome segment upstream of the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) 
      gene (Xq27.3) contains several genetic signals, among them is a DNA methylation 
      boundary that is located 65-70 CpGs upstream of the CGG repeat. In fragile X 
      syndrome (FXS), the boundary is lost, and the promoter is inactivated by 
      methylation spreading. Here we document boundary stability in spite of critical 
      expansions of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in male or female premutation carriers 
      and in high functioning males (HFMs). HFMs carry a full CGG repeat expansion but 
      exhibit an unmethylated promoter and lack the FXS phenotype. The boundary is also 
      stable in Turner (45, X) females. A CTCF-binding site is located slightly 
      upstream of the methylation boundary and carries a unique G-to-A polymorphism 
      (single nucleotide polymorphism), which occurs 3.6 times more frequently in 
      genomes with CGG expansions. The increased frequency of this single nucleotide 
      polymorphism might have functional significance. In CGG expansions, the CTCF 
      region does not harbor additional mutations. In FXS individuals and often in 
      cells transgenomic for EBV (Epstein Barr Virus) DNA or for the telomerase gene, 
      the large number of normally methylated CpGs in the far-upstream region of the 
      boundary is decreased about 4-fold. A methylation boundary is also present in the 
      human genome segment upstream of the HTT (huntingtin) promoter (4p16.3) and is 
      stable both in normal and Huntington disease chromosomes. Hence, the vicinity of 
      an expanded repeat does not per se compromise methylation boundaries. Methylation 
      boundaries exert an important function as promoter safeguards.

AB  - Recent studies report a higher risk of dementia and motor symptoms in females 
      with the fragile X mental retardation 1 premutation (PM-carriers) than has 
      hitherto been appreciated. Here, we use dual-task gait paradigms to identify 
      potential markers of cognitive and motor decline in female PM-carriers. 
      Spatiotemporal gait characteristics and variability of gait were assessed during 
      single- and dual-task conditions in 28 female PM-carriers (mean age 41.32 +/- 8.03 
      years) and 31 female controls with normal fragile X mental retardation 1 alleles 
      (mean age 41.61 +/- 8.30 years). Despite comparable gait characteristics at 
      baseline, gait performance was significantly poorer for PM-carriers when 
      performing concurrent working memory tasks (counting backwards by 3's or 7's) 
      when compared with controls. Correlational analyses showed that low working 
      memory capacity was significantly associated with dual-task interference for the 
      gait domains of pace (speed, step length) and variability (step time, swing time) 
      in PM-carriers. Multiple regression analyses further showed that the interaction 
      between age and CGG repeat length was strongly predictive of gait variability 
      during dual-task performance. These findings indicate for the first time that 
      vulnerability in specific domains of gait control may act as sensitive surrogate 
      markers of future decline in female PM-carriers.

AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) and Fragile X syndrome (FXS) are among 40 diseases 
      associated with expansion of repeated sequences (TREDs). Although their molecular 
      pathology is not well understood, formation of repressive chromatin and unusual 
      DNA structures over repeat regions were proposed to play a role. Our study now 
      shows that RNA/DNA hybrids (R-loops) form in patient cells on expanded repeats of 
      endogenous FXN and FMR1 genes, associated with FRDA and FXS. These 
      transcription-dependent R-loops are stable, co-localise with repressive H3K9me2 
      chromatin mark and impede RNA Polymerase II transcription in patient cells. We 
      investigated the interplay between repressive chromatin marks and R-loops on the 
      FXN gene. We show that decrease in repressive H3K9me2 chromatin mark has no 
      effect on R-loop levels. Importantly, increasing R-loop levels by treatment with 
      DNA topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin leads to up-regulation of repressive 
      chromatin marks, resulting in FXN transcriptional silencing. This provides a 
      direct molecular link between R-loops and the pathology of TREDs, suggesting that 
      R-loops act as an initial trigger to promote FXN and FMR1 silencing. Thus R-loops 
      represent a common feature of nucleotide expansion disorders and provide a new 
      target for therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Folate-sensitive fragile sites (FSFS) are a rare cytogenetically visible subset 
      of dynamic mutations. Of the eight molecularly characterized FSFS, four are 
      associated with intellectual disability (ID). Cytogenetic expression results from 
      CGG tri-nucleotide-repeat expansion mutation associated with local CpG 
      hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing. The best studied is the FRAXA 
      site in the FMR1 gene, where large expansions cause fragile X syndrome, the most 
      common inherited ID syndrome. Here we studied three families with FRA2A 
      expression at 2q11 associated with a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental 
      phenotypes. We identified a polymorphic CGG repeat in a conserved, brain-active 
      alternative promoter of the AFF3 gene, an autosomal homolog of the X-linked 
      AFF2/FMR2 gene: Expansion of the AFF2 CGG repeat causes FRAXE ID. We found that 
      FRA2A-expressing individuals have mosaic expansions of the AFF3 CGG repeat in the 
      range of several hundred repeat units. Moreover, bisulfite sequencing and 
      pyrosequencing both suggest AFF3 promoter hypermethylation. cSNP-analysis 
      demonstrates monoallelic expression of the AFF3 gene in FRA2A carriers thus 
      predicting that FRA2A expression results in functional haploinsufficiency for 
      AFF3 at least in a subset of tissues. By whole-mount in situ hybridization the 
      mouse AFF3 ortholog shows strong regional expression in the developing brain, 
      somites and limb buds in 9.5-12.5dpc mouse embryos. Our data suggest that there 
      may be an association between FRA2A and a delay in the acquisition of motor and 
      language skills in the families studied here. However, additional cases are 
      required to firmly establish a causal relationship.

AB  - Expansion of a trinucleotide (CGG) repeat element within the 5' untranslated 
      region (5'UTR) of the human FMR1 gene is responsible for a number of heritable 
      disorders operating through distinct pathogenic mechanisms: gene silencing for 
      fragile X syndrome (>200 CGG) and RNA toxic gain-of-function for FXTAS ( approximately  55-200 
      CGG). Existing models have focused almost exclusively on post-transcriptional 
      mechanisms, but co-transcriptional processes could also contribute to the 
      molecular dysfunction of FMR1. We have observed that transcription through the 
      GC-rich FMR1 5'UTR region favors R-loop formation, with the nascent (G-rich) RNA 
      forming a stable RNA:DNA hybrid with the template DNA strand, thereby displacing 
      the non-template DNA strand. Using DNA:RNA (hybrid) immunoprecipitation (DRIP) of 
      genomic DNA from cultured human dermal fibroblasts with both normal ( approximately  30 CGG 
      repeats) and premutation (55<CGG<200 repeats) alleles, we provide evidence for 
      FMR1 R-loop formation in human genomic DNA. Using a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible 
      episomal system in which both the CGG-repeat and transcription frequency can be 
      varied, we further show that R-loop formation increases with higher expression 
      levels. Finally, non-denaturing bisulfite mapping of the displaced 
      single-stranded DNA confirmed R-loop formation at the endogenous FMR1 locus and 
      further indicated that R-loops formed over CGG repeats may be prone to structural 
      complexities, including hairpin formation, not commonly associated with other 
      R-loops. These observations introduce a new molecular feature of the FMR1 gene 
      that is directly affected by CGG-repeat expansion and is likely to be involved in 
      the associated cellular dysfunction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased rates of autoinflammatory and autoimmune disorders have 
      been observed in female premutation carriers of CGG repeat expansion alleles of 
      between 55-200 repeats in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. To 
      determine whether an abnormal immune profile was present at a cellular level that 
      may predispose female carriers to autoinflammatory conditions, we investigated 
      dynamic cytokine production following stimulation of blood cells. In addition, 
      splenocyte responses were examined in an FMR1 CGG knock-in mouse model of the 
      fragile X premutation. METHODS: Human monocyte and peripheral blood leukocytes 
      (PBLs) were isolated from the blood of 36 female FMR1 premutation carriers and 15 
      age-matched controls. Cells were cultured with media alone, LPS or PHA. In the 
      animal model, splenocytes were isolated from 32 CGG knock-in mice and 32 wild 
      type littermates. Splenocytes were cultured with media alone or LPS or 
      PMA/Ionomycin. Concentrations of cytokines (GM-CSF, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, 
      IL-17, IFNgamma, TNFalpha, and MCP-1) were determined from the supernatants of cellular 
      cultures via Luminex multiplex assay. Additionally, phenotypic cellular markers 
      were assessed on cells isolated from human subjects via flow cytometry. RESULTS: 
      We found decreases in cytokine production in human premutation carriers as well 
      as in the FMR1 knock-in mice when compared with controls. Levels of cytokines 
      were found to be associated with CGG repeat length in both human and mouse. 
      Furthermore, T cells from human premutation carriers showed decreases in cell 
      surface markers of activation when compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      study, FMR1 CGG repeat expansions are associated with decreased immune responses 
      and immune dysregulation in both humans and mice. Deficits in immune responses in 
      female premutation carriers may lead to increased susceptibility to autoimmunity 
      and further research is warranted to determine the link between FMR1 CGG repeat 
      lengths and onset of autoinflammatory conditions.

      disability/developmental delay (ID/DD), especially in males. It is caused most 
      often by CGG trinucleotide repeat expansions, and less frequently by point 
      mutations and partial or full deletions of the FMR1 gene. The wide clinical 
      spectrum of affected females partly depends on their X-inactivation status. Only 
      few female ID/DD patients with microdeletions including FMR1 have been reported. 
      We describe 3 female patients with 3.5-, 4.2- and 9.2-Mb de novo microdeletions 
      in Xq27.3-q28 containing FMR1. X-inactivation was random in all patients, yet 
      they presented with ID/DD as well as speech delay, macrocephaly and other 
      features attributable to FXS. No signs of autism were present. Here, we further 
      delineate the clinical spectrum of female patients with microdeletions. FMR1 
      expression studies gave no evidence for an absolute threshold below which signs 
      of FXS present. Since FMR1 expression is known to be highly variable between 
      unrelated females, and since FMR1 mRNA levels have been suggested to be more 
      similar among family members, we further explored the possibility of an 
      intrafamilial effect. Interestingly, FMR1 mRNA levels in all 3 patients were 
      significantly lower than in their respective mothers, which was shown to be 
      specific for patients with microdeletions containing FMR1.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common inherited cause of intellectual disability 
      that results from a CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene. Large repeat 
      expansions trigger both transcriptional and translational suppression of Fragile 
      X protein (FMRP) production. Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) 
      is an allelic neurodegenerative disease caused by smaller "pre-mutation" CGG 
      repeat expansions that enhance FMR1 transcription but lead to translational 
      inefficiency and reduced FMRP expression in animal models. Sensorimotor gating as 
      measured by pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) is altered in both FXS patients and Fmr1 
      knock out (KO) mice. Similarly, FXTAS patients have demonstrated PPI deficits. 
      Recent work suggests there may be overlapping synaptic defects between Fmr1 KO 
      and CGG knock-in premutation mouse models (CGG KI). We therefore sought to 
      interrogate PPI in CGG KI mice. Using a quiet PPI protocol more akin to human 
      testing conditions, we find that Fmr1 KO animals have significantly impaired PPI. 
      Using this same protocol, we find CGG KI mice demonstrate an age-dependent 
      impairment in PPI compared to wild type (WT) controls. This study describes a 
      novel phenotype in CGG KI mice that can be used in future therapeutic development 
      targeting premutation associated symptoms.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual 
      disability and is closely linked with autism. The genetic basis of FXS is an 
      expansion of CGG repeats in the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene on the X 
      chromosome leading to the loss of expression of the fragile X mental retardation 
      protein (FMRP). The cause of FXS has been known for over 20 years, yet the full 
      molecular and cellular consequences of this mutation remain unclear. Although 
      mouse and fly models have provided significant understanding of this disorder and 
      its effects on the central nervous system, insight from human studies is limited. 
      We have created human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from fibroblasts 
      obtained from individuals with FXS to enable in vitro modeling of the human 
      disease. Three young boys with FXS who came from a well-characterized cohort 
      representative of the range of affectedness typical for the syndrome were 
      recruited to aid in linking cellular and behavioral phenotypes. The FMR1 mutation 
      is preserved during the reprogramming of patient fibroblasts to iPSCs. Mosaicism 
      of the CGG repeat length in one of the patient's fibroblasts allowed for the 
      generation of isogenic lines with differing CGG repeat lengths from the same 
      patient. FXS forebrain neurons were differentiated from these iPSCs and display 
      defective neurite initiation and extension. These cells provide a 
      well-characterized resource to examine potential neuronal deficits caused by FXS 
      as well as the function of FMRP in human neurons.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited intellectual 
      disability, is caused by expansion of CGG trinucleotide repeat at the 5' 
      untranslated region of the FMR1 gene at Xq27. In affected individuals, the CGG 
      repeat expansion leads to hypermethylation and the gene is transcriptionally 
      inactive. Our aim was to identify fragile X syndrome among children with 
      intellectual disability in Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 
      63 patients (53 males, 10 females) presented with intellectual disability, 29 
      normal subjects, and 23 other family members. DNA samples from six patients 
      previously diagnosed with fragile X syndrome by Southern blot technique were used 
      as positive controls. The method was based on bisulfite treatment of DNA followed 
      by two different techniques. The first technique applied polymerase chain 
      reaction amplification using one set of primers specific for amplifying 
      methylated CpG dinucleotide region; another set designed to amplify the 
      unmethylated CGG repeats. The second technique used the methylation-specific 
      melting curve analysis for detection of methylation status of the FMR1 promoter 
      region. RESULTS: Molecular testing using methylation sensitive polymerase chain 
      reaction had shown amplified products in all normal subjects using unmethylated 
      but not methylated primers indicating normal alleles, whereas amplified products 
      were obtained using methylated polymerase chain reaction primers in fragile X 
      syndrome-positive samples and in 9 of 53 males, indicating affected individuals. 
      Molecular testing using melting curve analysis has shown a single low melting 
      peak in all normal males and in (44/53) patients indicating unmethylated FMR1 
      gene, whereas high melting peak indicating methylated gene was observed in the 
      fragile X syndrome-positive samples and in 9 of 53 patients. We found 100% 
      concordance between results of both techniques and the results of Southern blot 
      analysis. Three samples have shown both methylated and unmethylated alleles, 
      indicating possible mosaicism. No female patients or carriers could be detected 
      by both techniques. CONCLUSION: The technique can be applied for the rapid 
      screening for fragile X syndrome among patients with intellectual disability. The 
      impact of mosaicism on clinical severity needs further investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Greater than 200 CGG repeats in the 5'UTR of the FMR1 gene lead to 
      epigenetic silencing and lack of the FMR1 protein, causing fragile X Syndrome. 
      Individual carriers of a premutation (PM) allele with 55-200 CGG repeats are 
      typically unmethylated and can present with clinical features defined as 
      FMR1-associated conditions. METHODS: Blood samples from 17 male PM carriers were 
      assessed clinically and molecularly by Southern blot, western blot, PCR and 
      QRT-PCR. Blood and brain tissue from an additional 18 PM males were also 
      similarly examined. Continuous outcomes were modelled using linear regression and 
      binary outcomes were modelled using logistic regression. RESULTS: Methylated 
      alleles were detected in different fractions of blood cells in all PM cases 
      (n=17). CGG repeat numbers correlated with percent of methylation and mRNA levels 
      and, especially in the upper PM range, with greater number of clinical 
      involvements. Inter-tissue/intra-tissue somatic instability and differences in 
      percent methylation were observed between blood and fibroblasts (n=4) and also 
      observed between blood and different brain regions in three of the 18 PM cases 
      examined. CGG repeat lengths in lymphocytes remained unchanged over a period of 
      time ranging from 2 to 6 years, three cases for whom multiple samples were 
      available. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to CGG size instability, individuals with a 
      PM expanded allele can exhibit methylation and display more clinical features 
      likely due to RNA toxicity and/or FMR1 silencing. The observed association 
      between CGG repeat length and percent of methylation with the severity of the 
      clinical phenotypes underscores the potential value of methylation in affected PM 
      to further understand penetrance, inform diagnosis and expand treatment options.

PG  - 1002-5
LID - 10.1126/science.1245831 [doi]
AB  - Epigenetic gene silencing is seen in several repeat-expansion diseases. In 
      fragile X syndrome, the most common genetic form of mental retardation, a CGG 
      trinucleotide-repeat expansion adjacent to the fragile X mental retardation 1 
      (FMR1) gene promoter results in its epigenetic silencing. Here, we show that FMR1 
      silencing is mediated by the FMR1 mRNA. The FMR1 mRNA contains the transcribed 
      CGG-repeat tract as part of the 5' untranslated region, which hybridizes to the 
      complementary CGG-repeat portion of the FMR1 gene to form an RNA.DNA duplex. 
      Disrupting the interaction of the mRNA with the CGG-repeat portion of the FMR1 
      gene prevents promoter silencing. Thus, our data link trinucleotide-repeat 
      expansion to a form of RNA-directed gene silencing mediated by direct 
      interactions of the trinucleotide-repeat RNA and DNA.

TI  - CNS expression of murine fragile X protein (FMRP) as a function of CGG-repeat 
      size.
PG  - 3228-38
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddu032 [doi]
AB  - Large expansions of a CGG-repeat element (>200 repeats; full mutation) in the 
      fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene cause fragile X syndrome (FXS), the 
      leading single-gene form of intellectual disability and of autism spectrum 
      disorder. Smaller expansions (55-200 CGG repeats; premutation) result in the 
      neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). 
      Whereas FXS is caused by gene silencing and insufficient FMR1 protein (FMRP), 
      FXTAS is thought to be caused by 'toxicity' of expanded-CGG-repeat mRNA. However, 
      as FMRP expression levels decrease with increasing CGG-repeat length, lowered 
      protein may contribute to premutation-associated clinical involvement. To address 
      this issue, we measured brain Fmr1 mRNA and FMRP levels as a function of 
      CGG-repeat length in a congenic (CGG-repeat knock-in) mouse model using 57 
      wild-type and 97 expanded-CGG-repeat mice carrying up to ~250 CGG repeats. While 
      Fmr1 message levels increased with repeat length, FMRP levels trended downward 
      over the same range, subject to significant inter-subject variation. Human 
      comparisons of protein levels in the frontal cortex of 7 normal and 17 FXTAS 
      individuals revealed that the mild FMRP decrease in mice mirrored the more 
      limited data for FMRP expression in the human samples. In addition, FMRP 
      expression levels varied in a subset of mice across the cerebellum, frontal 
      cortex, and hippocampus, as well as at different ages. These results provide a 
      foundation for understanding both the CGG-repeat-dependence of FMRP expression 
      and for interpreting clinical phenotypes in premutation carriers in terms of the 
      balance between elevated mRNA and lowered FMRP expression levels.

AB  - Previous studies have examined DNA methylation in different trinucleotide repeat 
      diseases. We have combined this data and used a pattern searching algorithm to 
      identify motifs in the DNA surrounding aberrantly methylated CpGs found in the 
      DNA of patients with one of the three trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansion 
      diseases: fragile X syndrome (FRAXA), myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1), or 
      Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). We examined sequences surrounding both the variably 
      methylated (VM) CpGs, which are hypermethylated in patients compared with 
      unaffected controls, and the nonvariably methylated CpGs which remain either 
      always methylated (AM) or never methylated (NM) in both patients and controls. 
      Using the J48 algorithm of WEKA analysis, we identified that two patterns are all 
      that is necessary to classify our three regions CCGG * which is found in VM and 
      not in AM regions and AATT * which distinguished between NM and VM + AM using 
      proportional frequency. Furthermore, comparing our software with MEME software, 
      we have demonstrated that our software identifies more patterns than MEME in 
      these short DNA sequences. Thus, we present evidence that the DNA sequence 
      surrounding CpG can influence its susceptibility to be de novo methylated in a 
      disease state associated with a trinucleotide repeat.

TI  - Association between fragile X premutation and premature ovarian failure: a 
      case-control study and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1255-62
LID - 10.1007/s00404-014-3145-4 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between FMR1 
      premutation and premature ovarian failure (POF) patients in Indian population, 
      and a meta-analysis of published results was undertaken to clarify whether FMR1 
      premutation consistently contributed to the susceptibility. METHODS: A total of 
      289 POF samples and 360 control samples were included in the study. Repeat 
      variation was checked using GeneScan technique. Results were analyzed with 
      GeneMapper software. Meta-analysis was performed using the Open Meta-Analyst and 
      STATA 12.0 software. The crude odds ratio with 95 % confidence interval (CI) was 
      computed to assess the strength of the associations. RESULTS: The assayed case 
      and control population showed 29 different CGG repeat sizes (alleles), ranging 
      from 7 to 40. Within this population, we found that the CGG repeat length 
      polymorphisms were within the normal range of 6-55 in both patients as well as 
      control samples. Eleven case-control studies were included in the meta-analysis 
      with a total of 1,313 POF cases and 3,132 control subjects. Our meta-analysis 
      revealed that there was a significant difference in the incidence of FMR1 
      premutation between POF cases and control subjects with p value <0.001 (OR 5.41; 
      95 % CI 2.53, 11.61). CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant association between 
      FMR1 CGG repeat premutation and POF in Indian population. However, the 
      meta-analysis showed an increased risk of POF associated with a premutation, 
      especially among populations from European descent. Further functional research 
      should be performed to explain the inconsistent results in different ethnicities 
      and POF susceptibility.

TI  - Fragile X syndrome due to a missense mutation.
PG  - 1185-9
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2013.311 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is a common inherited form of intellectual disability and 
      autism spectrum disorder. Most patients exhibit a massive CGG-repeat expansion 
      mutation in the FMR1 gene that silences the locus. In over two decades since the 
      discovery of FMR1, only a single missense mutation (p.(Ile304Asn)) has been 
      reported as causing fragile X syndrome. Here we describe a 16-year-old male 
      presenting with fragile X syndrome but without the repeat expansion mutation. 
      Rather, we find a missense mutation, c.797G>A, that replaces glycine 266 with 
      glutamic acid (p.(Gly266Glu)). The Gly266Glu FMR protein abolished many 
      functional properties of the protein. This patient highlights the diagnostic 
      utility of FMR1 sequencing.

AB  - We utilized a sample of 299 adult females aged between 19 and 86 years, carrying 
      fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) alleles with small CCG expansions ranging 
      from 50 to 141 repeats to analyse the relationships between psychological 
      symptoms as assessed by the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) and the size 
      of the CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene. There were highly significant (negative) 
      correlations between the size of the CGG repeat and a great majority of SCL-90-R 
      subscale scores and all the global indices, suggesting that carriers of 
      premutations in the mid-size CGG repeat range may be at greatest risk for the 
      development of psychiatric disorder.

AB  - There is evidence which demonstrates that a subset of males with a premutation 
      CGG repeat expansion (between 55 and 200 repeats) of the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 gene exhibit subtle deficits of executive function that 
      progressively deteriorate with increasing age and CGG repeat length. However, it 
      remains unclear whether similar deficits, which may indicate the onset of more 
      severe degeneration, are evident in female PM-carriers. In the present study we 
      explore whether female PM-carriers exhibit deficits of executive function which 
      parallel those of male PM-carriers. Fourteen female fragile X premutation 
      carriers without fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome and fourteen age, 
      sex, and IQ matched controls underwent ocular motor and neuropsychological tests 
      of select executive processes, specifically of response inhibition and working 
      memory. Group comparisons revealed poorer inhibitory control for female 
      premutation carriers on ocular motor tasks, in addition to demonstrating some 
      difficulties in behaviour self-regulation, when compared to controls. A negative 
      correlation between CGG repeat length and antisaccade error rates for premutation 
      carriers was also found. Our preliminary findings indicate that impaired 
      inhibitory control may represent a phenotype characteristic which may be a 
      sensitive risk biomarker within this female fragile X premutation population.

      expansion FMR1 alleles: a pilot study.
PG  - 67-76
LID - 10.1159/000356190 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Alleles of the FMR1 gene containing small expansions of the 
      CGG-trinucleotide repeat comprise premutation and grey-zone alleles. Premutation 
      alleles may cause late-onset Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      attributed to the neurotoxic effect of elevated FMR1 transcripts. Our earlier 
      data suggested that both grey-zone and low-end premutation alleles might also 
      play a significant role in the acquisition of the parkinsonian phenotype due to 
      mitochondrial dysfunction caused by elevated FMR1 mRNA toxicity. These data were 
      obtained through clinical and molecular comparisons between carriers of 
      grey-zone/low-end premutation alleles and group-matched non-carrier controls from 
      patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD). We aimed to explore the 
      relationship between grey-zone alleles, parkinsonism and white matter changes. 
      METHODS: This study compared the extent and severity of white matter 
      hyperintensity (WMH) on magnetic resonance imaging, using a semi-quantitative 
      method, between 11 grey-zone/low-end premutation carriers and 20 non-carrier 
      controls with iPD from our earlier study. Relationships between WMH scores, and 
      cognitive and motor test scores were assessed for carriers and non-carriers. 
      RESULTS: Supratentorial WMH scores, and tremor and ataxia motor scores were 
      significantly higher in carriers compared with disease controls. Moreover, some 
      associations between cognitive decline and WMH scores were specific for each 
      respective carrier status category. CONCLUSIONS: The results support our earlier 
      claim that grey-zone alleles contribute to the severity of parkinsonism and white 
      matter changes.

TI  - Gender and cell-type-specific effects of the transcription-coupled repair 
      protein, ERCC6/CSB, on repeat expansion in a mouse model of the fragile X-related 
      disorders.
PG  - 341-9
AB  - The repeat expansion diseases are human genetic disorders that arise from the 
      expansion of a tandem-repeat tract. The Fragile X-related disorders are members 
      of this disease group in which the repeat unit is CGG/CCG and is located in the 
      5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. Affected individuals often show 
      mosaicism with respect to repeat number resulting from both expansion and 
      contraction of the repeat tract; however, the mechanism responsible for these 
      changes in repeat number is unknown. The work from a variety of model systems 
      suggests that transcription-coupled repair (TCR) may contribute to repeat 
      instability in diseases resulting from CAG/CTG-repeat expansion. To test whether 
      TCR could contribute to repeat instability in the Fragile X-related disorders, we 
      tested the effect of mutations in Csb (Cockayne syndrome group B), a gene 
      essential for TCR, in a knock-in mouse model of these disorders. We found that 
      the loss of CSB affects expansions in a gender and cell-type-specific manner. Our 
      data also show an unanticipated gender difference in instability even in Csb+/+ 
      animals that may have implications for our understanding of the mechanism of 
      repeat expansion in the FX mouse model and perhaps for humans as well.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene 
      that appears to occur during oogenesis and during early embryogenesis. One model 
      proposes that repeat instability depends on the replication fork direction 
      through the repeats such that (CNG)n hairpin-like structures form, causing DNA 
      polymerase to stall and slip. Examining DNA replication fork progression on 
      single DNA molecules at the endogenous FMR1 locus revealed that replication forks 
      stall at CGG repeats in human cells. Furthermore, replication profiles of FXS 
      human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) compared to nonaffected hESCs showed that fork 
      direction through the repeats is altered at the FMR1 locus in FXS hESCs, such 
      that predominantly the CCG strand serves as the lagging-strand template. This is 
      due to the absence of replication initiation that would typically occur upstream 
      of FMR1, suggesting that altered replication origin usage combined with fork 
      stalling promotes repeat instability during early embryonic development.

TI  - AGG/CCT interruptions affect nucleosome formation and positioning of 
      healthy-length CGG/CCG triplet repeats.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited form of mental 
      retardation, is caused by expansion of a CGG/CCG repeat tract in the 
      5'-untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene, which 
      changes the functional organization of the gene from euchromatin to 
      heterochromatin. Interestingly, healthy-length repeat tracts possess AGG/CCT 
      interruptions every 9-10 repeats, and clinical data shows that loss of these 
      interruptions is linked to expansion of the repeat tract to disease-length. Thus, 
      it is important to understand how these interruptions alter the behavior of the 
      repeat tract in the packaged gene. RESULTS: To investigate how uninterrupted and 
      interrupted CGG/CCG repeat tracts interact with the histone core, we designed 
      experiments using the nucleosome core particle, the most basic unit of chromatin 
      packaging. Using DNA containing 19 CGG/CCG repeats, flanked by either a 
      nucleosome positioning sequence or the FMR1 gene sequence, we determined that the 
      addition of a single AGG/CCT interruption modulates both the ability of the 
      CGG/CCG repeat DNA to incorporate into a nucleosome and the rotational and 
      translational position of the repeat DNA around the histone core when flanked by 
      the nucleosome positioning sequence. The presence of these interruptions also 
      alters the periodicity of the DNA in the nucleosome; interrupted repeat tracts 
      have a greater periodicity than uninterrupted repeats. CONCLUSIONS: This work 
      defines the ability of AGG/CCT interruptions to modulate the behavior of the 
      repeat tract in the packaged gene and contributes to our understanding of the 
      role that AGG/CCT interruptions play in suppressing expansion and maintaining the 
      correct functional organization of the FMR1 gene, highlighting a protective role 
      played by the interruptions in genomic packaging.

LID - 10.1261/rna.041442.113 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental impairment in 
      humans, is caused by the absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein 
      (FMRP) due to a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5'-untranslated region 
      (UTR) and subsequent translational silencing of the fragile x mental 
      retardation-1 (FMR1) gene. FMRP, which is proposed to be involved in the 
      translational regulation of specific neuronal messenger RNA (mRNA) targets, 
      contains an arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) box RNA binding domain that has been 
      shown to bind with high affinity to G-quadruplex forming mRNA structures. FMRP 
      undergoes alternative splicing, and the binding of FMRP to a proposed 
      G-quadruplex structure in the coding region of its mRNA (named FBS) has been 
      proposed to affect the mRNA splicing events at exon 15. In this study, we used 
      biophysical methods to directly demonstrate the folding of FMR1 FBS into a 
      secondary structure that contains two specific G-quadruplexes and analyze its 
      interactions with several FMRP isoforms. Our results show that minor splice 
      isoforms, ISO2 and ISO3, created by the usage of the second and third acceptor 
      sites at exon 15, bind with higher affinity to FBS than FMRP ISO1, which is 
      created by the usage of the first acceptor site. FMRP ISO2 and ISO3 cannot 
      undergo phosphorylation, an FMRP post-translational modification shown to 
      modulate the protein translation regulation. Thus, their expression has to be 
      tightly regulated, and this might be accomplished by a feedback mechanism 
      involving the FMRP interactions with the G-quadruplex structures formed within 
      FMR1 mRNA.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome and associated disorders are characterized by the number of 
      CGG repeats and methylation status of the FMR1 gene for which Southern blot (SB) 
      historically has been required for analysis. This study describes a simple 
      PCR-only workflow (mPCR) to replace SB analysis, that incorporates novel 
      procedural controls, treatment of the DNA in separate control and 
      methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease reactions, amplification with 
      labeled primers, and two-color amplicon sizing by capillary electrophoresis. mPCR 
      was evaluated in two independent laboratories with 76 residual clinical samples 
      that represented typical and challenging fragile X alleles in both males and 
      females. mPCR enabled superior size resolution and analytical sensitivity for 
      size and methylation mosaicism compared to SB. Full mutation mosaicism was 
      detected down to 1% in a background of 99% normal allele with 50- to 100-fold 
      less DNA than required for SB. A low level of full mutation mosaicism in one 
      sample was detected using mPCR but not observed using SB. Overall, the 
      sensitivity for detection of full mutation alleles was 100% (95% CI: 89%-100%) 
      with an accuracy of 99% (95% CI: 93%-100%). mPCR analysis of DNA from individuals 
      with Klinefelter and Turner syndromes, and DNA from sperm and blood, were 
      consistent with SB. As such, mPCR enables accurate, sensitive, and standardized 
      methods of FMR1 analysis that can harmonize results across different 
      laboratories.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor and ataxia syndrome, Fragile X-associated primary 
      ovarian insufficiency, and Fragile X syndrome are Repeat Expansion Diseases 
      caused by expansion of a CGG*CCG-repeat microsatellite in the 5 UTR of the FMR1 
      gene. To help understand the expansion mechanism responsible for these disorders, 
      we have crossed mice containing approximately 147 CGG*CCG repeats in the endogenous murine Fmr1 
      gene with mice containing a null mutation in the gene encoding the mismatch 
      repair protein MSH2. MSH2 mutations are associated with elevated levels of 
      generalized microsatellite instability. However, we show here for the first time 
      that in the FX mouse model, all maternally and paternally transmitted expansions 
      require Msh2. Even the loss of one Msh2 allele reduced the intergenerational 
      expansion frequency significantly. Msh2 is also required for all somatic 
      expansions and loss of even one functional Msh2 allele reduced the extent of 
      somatic expansion in some organs. Tissues with lower levels of MSH2 were more 
      sensitive to the loss of a single Msh2 allele. This suggests that MSH2 is rate 
      limiting for expansion in this mouse model and that MSH2 levels may be a key 
      factor that accounts for tissue-specific differences in expansion risk.

TI  - Maternal FMR1 premutation allele expansion and contraction in fraternal twins.
PG  - 2620-5
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.36123 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome results from an expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in 
      the 5' untranslated region of the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. 
      Expansion of a maternal premutation allele is the mechanism by which a full 
      mutation allele arises; contraction of a maternal premutation allele is rare. 
      Here we report on both an expansion and contraction of a maternal FMR1 
      premutation allele in fraternal twins. The propositus was the product of a 
      29-week gestation twin pregnancy and was referred for FMR1 testing due to 
      developmental delay. A FMR1 full mutation with complete methylation was observed 
      on Southern blot analysis. Evaluation of the maternal FMR1 gene by PCR revealed a 
      normal and premutation allele with CGG repeat numbers of 30 and 93, respectively. 
      Subsequent FMR1 testing on the twin sister of the propositus detected CGG repeat 
      numbers of 30 and 54. The FMR1 CGG repeat number of the reproductive partner was 
      30. The FMR1 CGG repeat 30 allele in the twin sister was determined to be of 
      paternal origin and the FMR1 allele with a CGG repeat number of 54 was of 
      maternal origin. This observation is particularly interesting not only because of 
      the concomitant donation of a FMR1 expanded and contracted premutation allele in 
      a twin pregnancy but also because of the significant degree of contraction (39

AB  - Recent investigations report a higher risk of motor symptoms in females with the 
      FMR1 premutation (PM-carriers) than has hitherto been appreciated. Here we 
      examined basic sensorimotor and postural control under different sensory and 
      attentional dual-task demands. Physiological performance and postural sway 
      measures from the Physiological Profile Assessment (Lord et al., 2003 [39]) were 
      conducted in 28 female PM-carriers (mean age: 41.32+/-8.03) and 31 female controls 
      with normal FMR1 alleles (mean age: 41.61+/-8.3). Multiple regression analyses were 
      conducted to examine the moderating role of CGG-repeat length on the relation 
      between age and postural sway under dual-task interference. In female 
      PM-carriers, our results showed significantly poorer proprioceptive awareness, 
      slower reaction time, and greater postural displacement when performing a 
      concurrent verbal fluency task. Significantly, these findings showed age- and 
      genetically-modulated changes in dual-task postural displacement in the 
      medio-lateral direction in female PM-carriers. These findings highlight the 
      sensitivity of postural control paradigms in identifying early cerebellar 
      postural changes that may act as surrogate markers of future decline in female 
      PM-carriers.

TI  - Mosaicism for FMR1 gene full mutation and intermediate allele in a female foetus: 
      a postzygotic retraction event.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome is caused by the expansion of an unstable CGG repeat in the 
      5'UTR of FMR1 gene. The occurrence of mosaicism is not uncommon, especially in 
      male patients, whereas in females it is not so often reported. Here we report a 
      female foetus that was subject to prenatal diagnosis, because of her mother being 
      a premutation carrier. The foetus was identified as being a mosaic for an 
      intermediate allele and a full mutation of FMR1 gene, in the presence of a normal 
      allele. The mosaic status was confirmed in three different tissues of the 
      foetus--amniotic fluid, skin biopsy and blood--the last two obtained after 
      pregnancy termination. Karyotype analysis and X-chromosome STR markers analysis 
      do not support the mosaicism as inheritance of both maternal alleles. 
      Oligonucleotide array-CGH excluded an imbalance that could contain the primer 
      binding site with a different repeat size. The obtained results give compelling 
      evidence for a postzygotic expansion mechanism where the foetus mosaic pattern 
      originated from expansion of the mother's premutation into a full mutation and 
      consequent regression to an intermediate allele in a proportion of cells. These 
      events occurred in early embryogenesis before the commitment of cells into the 
      different tissues, as the three tested tissues of the foetus have the same mosaic 
      pattern. The couple has a son with Fragile X mental retardation syndrome and 
      choose to terminate this pregnancy after genetic counselling.

TI  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome: influence of the FMR1 gene on motor 
      fiber tracts in males with normal and premutation alleles.
PG  - 1022-9
LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2013.2934 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Individuals with the fragile X premutation express expanded CGG 
      repeats (repeats 55-200) in the FMR1 gene and elevated FMR1 messenger RNA (mRNA) 
      levels, both of which may underlie the occurrence of the late-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). 
      Because the core feature of FXTAS is motor impairment, determining the influence 
      of FMR1 mRNA levels on structural connectivity of motor fiber tracts is critical 
      for a better understanding of the pathologic features of FXTAS. OBJECTIVE: To 
      examine the associations of CGG repeat and FMR1 mRNA with motor-related fiber 
      tracts in males with premutation alleles. DESIGN AND SETTING: A case-control 
      study conducted at the University of California, Davis, from April 1, 2008, 
      through August 31, 2009. All data were collected masked to the carrier status of 
      the FMR1 gene. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six male premutation carriers with FXTAS and 
      26 male premutation carriers without FXTAS were recruited through their family 
      relationships with children affected by fragile X syndrome. The controls were 34 
      unaffected family members and healthy volunteers from the local community. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The CGG repeat lengths and FMR1 mRNA expression levels in 
      peripheral blood lymphocytes, motor functioning, and white matter structural 
      integrity that were estimated using diffusion tensor imaging. After data 
      collection, we selected 4 motor tracts to reconstruct using diffusion tensor 
      tractography, namely, the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, descending 
      motor tracts (containing the corticospinal, corticobulbar, and corticopontine 
      tracts), and the anterior body of the corpus callosum. RESULTS: All fiber tracts 
      exhibited weaker structural connectivity in the FXTAS group (decreased 5%-53% 
      from controls, P </= .02). Genetic imaging correlation analysis revealed negative 
      associations of CGG repeat length and FMR1 mRNA with connectivity strength of the 
      superior cerebellar peduncles in both premutation groups (partial r(2) = 0.23-0.33, 
      P </= .004). In addition, the measurements from the corpus callosum and superior 
      cerebellar peduncles revealed a high correlation with motor functioning in all 3 
      groups (r between partial least square predicted and actual test scores = 
      0.41-0.56, P </= .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Distinct pathophysiologic 
      processes may underlie the structural impairment of the motor tracts in FXTAS. 
      Although both the corpus callosum and superior cerebellar peduncles were of great 
      importance to motor functioning, only the superior cerebellar peduncles exhibited 
      an association with the elevated RNA levels in the blood of fragile X premutation 
      carriers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the number of CGG repeats in 
      the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene and serum levels of anti-Mullerian 
      hormone (AMH) in Korean infertility patients without premutation. STUDY DESIGN: A 
      retrospective study of 228 infertile women who received fertility treatment in a 
      single private in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinic from May 2010 to August 2012 
      was performed. Serum FSH and AMH were measured on menstrual day 3 and the number 
      of CGG repeats was evaluated. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 
      33.3+/-3.8 years. No significant correlation was observed between CGG repeat count 
      in both alleles and the serum FSH, AMH or multiples of median (MoM) of AMH in 
      whole study subjects. In women with age >/=35 years, however, there was an 
      increasing tendency in the MoM of AMH with increasing number of CGG repeats in 
      allele 2 (R(2)=0.075, p=0.008). This correlation was not observed in patients 
      aged less than 35 years. CONCLUSION: We observed a positive correlation between 
      MoM of AMH and number of CGG repeats in allele 2 in women aged over 35 years. Our 
      findings are discordant with other reports, and therefore further studies are 
      needed to determine whether this discrepancy is due to ethnic differences.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome, the leading inherited cause of mental retardation and autism 
      spectrum disorders worldwide, is caused by a tandem repeat expansion in the FMR1 
      (fragile X mental retardation 1) gene. It presents with a distinct behavioral 
      phenotype which overlaps significantly with that of autism. Emerging evidence 
      suggests that tandem repeat polymorphisms (TRPs) might also play a key role in 
      modulating disease susceptibility for a range of common polygenic disorders, 
      including the broader autism spectrum of disorders (ASD) and other forms of 
      psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder [1]. 
      In order to understand how TRPs and associated gene mutations mediate 
      pathogenesis, various mouse models have been generated. A crucial step in such 
      functional genomics is high-quality behavioral and cognitive phenotyping. This 
      chapter presents a basic behavioral battery for standardized tests for assaying 
      social phenotypes in mouse models of brain disorders, with a focus on aggression.

AB  - Detection of female premutation (PM) carriers of fragile X syndrome may be 
      important in that a PM allele from the mother can expand to a full mutation (FM) 
      when transmitted to the fetus. Although the PM carrier frequency might be 
      different in varying populations, there is a little data on the Korean 
      population. Furthermore, the risks of expansion to FM have not been studied in 
      Korean PM carriers. In this retrospective study, we estimated the female PM 
      carrier frequency and the risks of expansion to FM in Korean diagnostic samples 
      collected for FMR1 gene testing. Of 10,241 pre-conceptional or pregnant women, 13 
      PM [1 in 788; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1/1,250-1/455] and 75 intermediate 
      allele carriers (1 in 137; 95% CI, 1/172-1/110) were identified. In 26 prenatal 
      diagnoses cases, the PM allele was transmitted to the fetus in 13 pregnancies 
      (50%), and five of these expanded to FM. All of the maternal alleles exceeding 70 
      repeats expanded to FM. In conclusion, the PM frequency in Korean diagnostic 
      samples was lower than that reported in Western populations, while the risk for 
      FM expansion in alleles exceeding 70 repeats might be higher than expected based 
      upon previous reports.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) results from a CGG repeat 
      expansion in the 5' UTR of FMR1. This repeat is thought to elicit toxicity as 
      RNA, yet disease brains contain ubiquitin-positive neuronal inclusions, a 
      pathologic hallmark of protein-mediated neurodegeneration. We explain this 
      paradox by demonstrating that CGG repeats trigger repeat-associated 
      non-AUG-initiated (RAN) translation of a cryptic polyglycine-containing protein, 
      FMRpolyG. FMRpolyG accumulates in ubiquitin-positive inclusions in Drosophila, 
      cell culture, mouse disease models, and FXTAS patient brains. CGG RAN translation 
      occurs in at least two of three possible reading frames at repeat sizes ranging 
      from normal (25) to pathogenic (90), but inclusion formation only occurs with 
      expanded repeats. In Drosophila, CGG repeat toxicity is suppressed by eliminating 
      RAN translation and enhanced by increased polyglycine protein production. These 
      studies expand the growing list of nucleotide repeat disorders in which RAN 
      translation occurs and provide evidence that RAN translation contributes to 
      neurodegeneration.

AB  - The human X chromosome carries regions prone to genomic instability: deletions in 
      the Xp22.31 region, involving the steroid sulfatase gene (STS) cause X-linked 
      ichthyosis; rearrangements in the Xp21.2 region are associated with Duchenne or 
      Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD or BMD); and the Xq27.3 unstable region, 
      containing the (CGG)n repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene is associated with 
      fragile X syndrome. We report on a family with two affected boys, the elder 
      diagnosed with fragile X syndrome, the younger with DMD, and both suffering from 
      severe ichthyosis. The family was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction, 
      multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and haplotype analysis. The 
      mother proved to be an asymptomatic carrier of all three non-contiguous mutation 
      events, involving the STS gene, the DMD gene and a FMR1 expansion. To the best of 
      our knowledge, this is the first description of an asymptomatic carrier of three 
      different X-linked disorders, involving severe genetic rearrangements on both 
      long and short arms of the X chromosomes. The boy with fragile X syndrome has 
      inherited a triple recombinant maternal X chromosome, this way inheriting the 
      FMR1 expansion and ichthyosis, originating most probably from different maternal 
      Xes and excluding the DMD gene deletion. The transmission of these extremely 
      defective maternal chromosomes to the next generation involved several 
      recombinations.

      transport in cortical astrocytes expressing Fmr1 gene premutation expansion.
PG  - 13831-41
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M112.441055 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: FMR1 CGG expansion repeats in the premutation range have not been 
      linked to astrocyte pathophysiology. RESULTS: Premutation cortical astrocytes 
      display decreased Glu transporter expression/activity and enhanced asynchronous 
      Ca(2+) oscillations. CONCLUSION: Glu transport and Ca(2+) signaling defects in 
      premutation astrocytes could contribute to FXTAS neuropathology. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Premutation astrocytes may have an etiological role in FXTAS neuropathology. 
      Premutation CGG repeat expansions (55-200 CGG repeats; preCGG) within the fragile 
      X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene can cause fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome. Defects in early neuronal migration and morphology, 
      electrophysiological activity, and mitochondria trafficking have been described 
      in a premutation mouse model, but whether preCGG mutations also affect astrocyte 
      function remains unknown. PreCGG cortical astrocytes ( approximately 170 CGG repeats) displayed 
      3-fold higher Fmr1 mRNA and 30% lower FMR1 protein (FMRP) when compared with WT. 
      PreCGG astrocytes showed modest reductions in expression of glutamate (Glu) 
      transporters GLT-1 and GLAST and attenuated Glu uptake (p < 0.01). Consistent 
      with astrocyte cultures in vitro, aged preCGG mice cerebral cortex also displayed 
      reduced GLAST and GLT-1 expression. Approximately 65% of the WT and preCGG 
      cortical astrocytes displayed spontaneous asynchronous Ca(2+) oscillations. 
      PreCGG astrocytes exhibited nearly 50% higher frequency of asynchronous Ca(2+) 
      oscillations (p < 0.01) than WT, a difference mimicked by chronic exposure of WT 
      astrocytes to l-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (l-trans-PDC) or by 
      partial suppression of GLAST using siRNA interference. Acute challenge with Glu 
      augmented the frequency of Ca(2+) oscillations in both genotypes. Additionally, 
      10 mum Glu elicited a sustained intracellular Ca(2+) rise in a higher portion of 
      preCGG astrocytes when compared with WT. Pharmacological studies showed that 
      mGluR5, but not NMDA receptor, contributed to Glu hypersensitivity in preCGG 
      astrocytes. These functional defects in preCGG astrocytes, especially in Glu 
      signaling, may contribute to fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      neuropathology.

      Syndrome.
PG  - 90
LID - 10.1186/1756-0500-6-90 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and its associated disorders are caused by 
      the expansion of the CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the fragile X 
      mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, with disease classification based on the number 
      of CGG repeats. The mechanisms of repeat expansion are dependent on the presence 
      of cis elements and the absence of trans factors both of which are not mutually 
      exclusive and contribute to repeat instability. Expansions associated with trans 
      factors are due to the haploinsuffient or reduced expression of several DNA 
      repair/metabolizing proteins. The reduction of expression in trans factors has 
      been primarily conducted in animal models without substantial examination of many 
      of these expansion mechanisms and trans factors in humans. RESULTS: To understand 
      the trans factors and pathways associated with trinucleotide repeat expansion we 
      have analyzed two microarray datasets which characterized the transcript 
      expression in patients with FXS and in controls. CONCLUSION: We observed 
      significant down regulation of DNA damage/repair pathway transcripts. This 
      observation was consistent in both datasets, which used different populations. 
      Within these datasets, several transcripts overlapped in the direction of 
      association and fold change. Further characterization of these genes will be 
      critical to understand their role in trinucleotide repeat instability in FXS.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is an inherited 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of 55-200 CGG repeats in the 
      5' UTR of FMR1. These expanded CGG repeats are transcribed and accumulate in 
      nuclear RNA aggregates that sequester one or more RNA-binding proteins, thus 
      impairing their functions. Here, we have identified that the double-stranded 
      RNA-binding protein DGCR8 binds to expanded CGG repeats, resulting in the partial 
      sequestration of DGCR8 and its partner, DROSHA, within CGG RNA aggregates. 
      Consequently, the processing of microRNAs (miRNAs) is reduced, resulting in 
      decreased levels of mature miRNAs in neuronal cells expressing expanded CGG 
      repeats and in brain tissue from patients with FXTAS. Finally, overexpression of 
      DGCR8 rescues the neuronal cell death induced by expression of expanded CGG 
      repeats. These results support a model in which a human neurodegenerative disease 
      originates from the alteration, in trans, of the miRNA-processing machinery.

AB  - Whereas pragmatic language difficulties are characteristic of both autism and 
      Fragile X syndrome, it is unclear whether such deficits are qualitatively similar 
      or whether certain skills are differentially affected. This study compared 
      narrative competence in boys with autism, Fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome, and 
      typical development. Results revealed that an interaction between diagnosis and 
      nonverbal mental age predicted narrative microstructure (e.g., complex syntax) 
      but not macrostructure (e.g., thematic maintenance). Correlations with 
      FMR1-related variation were investigated in children with Fragile X syndrome. 
      While CGG repeat length was associated with many language characteristics, 
      nonverbal IQ appeared to mediate these relationships. These findings are an 
      important step toward understanding narrative abilities in boys with and without 
      the FMR1 mutation.

LID - tre-02-63-375-2 [pii]

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative 
      disorder with defining clinical features that include kinetic tremor, gait 
      ataxia, and parkinsonism, with associated features spanning medical, cognitive, 
      and psychiatric clinical domains. The emerging model for the pathogenesis of 
      FXTAS is that of RNA toxicity as a consequence of the sequestration of RNA 
      binding proteins by the expanded CGG-repeat element within the FMR1 message, thus 
      compromising the normal functions of those proteins. A principal challenge at 
      this point is to determine precisely which proteins are involved in FXTAS 
      pathogenesis and how to prevent or reverse this process. A second challenge is to 
      determine why there is incomplete penetrance of FXTAS among premutation carriers 
      with identical CGG-repeat lengths, and what the protective factors are in some 
      carriers. Finally, the discovery in premutation mice of early neurodevelopmental 
      abnormalities, some occurring even during late embryogenesis, raises the question 
      of whether FXTAS is the end-stage of a life-long process of neuronal 
      dysregulation. If an extended pre-clinical phase precedes the development of 
      FXTAS, there is great potential for therapeutic intervention, years or even 
      decades before its clinical features are manifest.

      Fragile X premutation mice.
PG  - 1180-92
LID - 10.1093/hmg/dds525 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X premutation-associated disorders, including Fragile X-associated Tremor 
      Ataxia Syndrome, result from unmethylated CGG repeat expansions in the 5' 
      untranslated region (UTR) of the FMR1 gene. Premutation-sized repeats increase 
      FMR1 transcription but impair rapid translation of the Fragile X mental 
      retardation protein (FMRP), which is absent in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). 
      Normally, FMRP binds to RNA and regulates metabotropic glutamate receptor 
      (mGluR)-mediated synaptic translation, allowing for dendritic synthesis of 
      several proteins. FMRP itself is also synthesized at synapses in response to 
      mGluR activation. However, the role of activity-dependent translation of FMRP in 
      synaptic plasticity and Fragile X-premutation-associated disorders is unknown. To 
      investigate this question, we utilized a CGG knock-in mouse model of the Fragile 
      X premutation with 120-150 CGG repeats in the mouse Fmr1 5' UTR. These mice 
      exhibit increased Fmr1 mRNA production but impaired FMRP translational 
      efficiency, leading to a modest reduction in basal FMRP expression. Cultured 
      hippocampal neurons and synaptoneurosomes derived from CGG KI mice demonstrate 
      impaired FMRP translation in response to the group I mGluR agonist 
      3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine. Electrophysiological analysis reveals enhanced 
      mGluR-mediated long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) at CA3-CA1 synapses in acute 
      hippocampal slices prepared from CGG KI mice relative to wild-type littermates, 
      similar to Fmr1 knockout mice. However, unlike mGluR-LTD in mice completely 
      lacking FMRP, mGluR-LTD in CGG knock-in mice remains dependent on new protein 
      synthesis. These studies demonstrate partially overlapping synaptic plasticity 
      phenotypes in mouse models of FXS and Fragile X premutation disorders and support 
      a role for activity-dependent synthesis of FMRP in enduring forms of synaptic 
      plasticity.

AB  - We recently reported a significant increase in the frequency of carriers of grey 
      zone (GZ) alleles of FMR1 gene in Australian males with Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      from Victoria and Tasmania. Here, we report data comparing an independent sample 
      of 817 PD patients from Queensland to 1078 consecutive Australian male newborns 
      from Victoria. We confirmed the earlier finding by observing a significant excess 
      of GZ alleles in PD (4.8%) compared to controls (1.5%). Although both studies 
      provided evidence in support of an association between GZ-carrier status and 
      increased risk for parkinsonism, the existing evidence in the literature from 
      screening studies remains equivocal and we discuss the need for alternative 
      approaches to resolve the issue.

TI  - Young adult male carriers of the fragile X premutation exhibit genetically 
      modulated impairments in visuospatial tasks controlled for psychomotor speed.
PG  - 26
LID - 10.1186/1866-1955-4-26 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous study reported enhanced psychomotor speed, and subtle but 
      significant cognitive impairments, modulated by age and by mutations in the 
      fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene in adult female fragile X premutation 
      carriers (fXPCs). Because male carriers, unlike females, do not have a second, 
      unaffected FMR1 allele, male fXPCs should exhibit similar, if not worse, 
      impairments. Understanding male fXPCs is of particular significance because of 
      their increased risk of developing fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS). METHODS: Male fXPCs (n = 18) and healthy control (HC) adults (n = 26) 
      aged less than 45 years performed two psychomotor speed tasks (manual and oral) 
      and two visuospatial tasks (magnitude comparison and enumeration). In the 
      magnitude comparison task, participants were asked to compare and judge which of 
      two bars was larger. In the enumeration task, participants were shown between one 
      and eight green bars in the center of the screen, and asked to state the total 
      number displayed. Enumeration typically proceeds in one of two modes: subitizing, 
      a fast and accurate process that works only with a small set of items, and 
      counting, which requires accurate serial-object detection and individuation 
      during visual search. We examined the associations between the performance on all 
      tasks and the age, full-scale intelligent quotient, and CGG repeat length of 
      participants. RESULTS: We found that in the magnitude comparison and enumeration 
      tasks, male fXPCs exhibited slower reaction times relative to HCs, even after 
      controlling for simple reaction time. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that male 
      fXPCs as a group show impairments (slower reaction times) in numerical 
      visuospatial tasks, which are consistent with previous findings. This adds to a 
      growing body of literature characterizing the phenotype in fXPCs who are 
      asymptomatic for FXTAS. Future longitudinal studies are needed to determine how 
      these impairments relate to risk of developing FXTAS.

TI  - Fear-specific amygdala function in children and adolescents on the fragile x 
      spectrum: a dosage response of the FMR1 gene.
PG  - 600-13
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhs341 [doi]
AB  - Mutations of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are the genetic cause 
      of fragile X syndrome (FXS). The presence of significant socioemotional problems 
      has been well documented in FXS although the brain basis of those deficits 
      remains unspecified. Here, we investigated amygdala dysfunction and its relation 
      to socioemotional deficits and FMR1 gene expression in children and adolescents 
      on the FX spectrum (i.e., individuals whose trinucleotide CGG repeat expansion 
      from 55 to over 200 places them somewhere within the fragile X diagnostic range 
      from premutation to full mutation). Participants performed an fMRI task in which 
      they viewed fearful, happy, and scrambled faces. Neuroimaging results 
      demonstrated that FX participants revealed significantly attenuated amygdala 
      activation in Fearful > Scrambled and Fearful > Happy contrasts compared with 
      their neurotypical counterparts, while showing no differences in amygdala volume. 
      Furthermore, we found significant relationships between FMR1 gene expression, 
      anxiety/social dysfunction scores, and reduced amygdala activation in the FX 
      group. In conclusion, we report novel evidence regarding a dosage response of the 
      FMR1 gene on fear-specific functions of the amygdala, which is associated with 
      socioemotional deficits in FXS.

PG  - 264
LID - 264
AB  - Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of X-linked intellectual 
      disability (ID), associated with a wide range of cognitive and behavioral 
      impairments. FXS is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene 
      located on the X-chromosome. FMR1 is expected to prevent the expression of the 
      "fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)", which results in altered 
      structural and functional development of the synapse, including a loss of 
      synaptic plasticity. This review aims to unveil the contribution of 
      electrophysiological signal studies for the understanding of the information 
      processing impairments in FXS patients. We discuss relevant event-related 
      potential (ERP) studies conducted with full mutation FXS patients and clinical 
      populations sharing symptoms with FXS in a developmental perspective. Specific 
      deviances found in FXS ERP profiles are described. Alterations are reported in 
      N1, P2, Mismatch Negativity (MMN), N2, and P3 components in FXS compared to 
      healthy controls. Particularly, deviances in N1 and P2 amplitude seem to be 
      specific to FXS. The presented results suggest a cascade of impaired information 
      processes that are in line with symptoms and anatomical findings in FXS.

AB  - Pre-mutation CGG repeat expansions (55-200 CGG repeats; pre-CGG) within the 
      fragile-X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene cause fragile-X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome in humans. Defects in neuronal morphology, early 
      migration, and electrophysiological activity have been described despite 
      appreciable expression of fragile-X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in a 
      pre-CGG knock-in (KI) mouse model. The triggers that initiate and promote pre-CGG 
      neuronal dysfunction are not understood. The absence of FMRP in a Drosophila 
      model of fragile-X syndrome was shown to increase axonal transport of 
      mitochondria. In this study, we show that dissociated hippocampal neuronal 
      culture from pre-CGG KI mice (average 170 CGG repeats) express 42.6% of the FMRP 
      levels and 3.8-fold higher Fmr1 mRNA than that measured in wild-type neurons at 4 
      days in vitro. Pre-CGG hippocampal neurons show abnormalities in the number, 
      mobility, and metabolic function of mitochondria at this early stage of 
      differentiation. Pre-CGG hippocampal neurites contained significantly fewer 
      mitochondria and greatly reduced mitochondria mobility. In addition, pre-CGG 
      neurons had higher rates of basal oxygen consumption and proton leak. We conclude 
      that deficits in mitochondrial trafficking and metabolic function occur despite 
      the presence of appreciable FMRP expression and may contribute to the early 
      pathophysiology in pre-CGG carriers and to the risk of developing clinical 
      fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome.

TI  - Neural substrates of executive dysfunction in fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome (FXTAS): a brain potential study.
PG  - 2657-66
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhs251 [doi]
AB  - Executive dysfunction in fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) has 
      been suggested to mediate other cognitive impairments. In the present study, 
      event-related potentials and neuropsychological testing were combined to 
      investigate the brain mechanisms underlying the executive dysfunction in FXTAS. 
      Thirty-two-channel electroencephalography was recorded during an auditory 
      "oddball" task requiring dual responses. FXTAS patients (N= 41, mean age= 62) 
      displayed prolonged latencies of N1 and P3 and reduced amplitudes of P2 and P3, 
      whereas their N2 measures remained within the normal range, indicating relatively 
      preserved early-stage auditory attention but markedly impaired late-stage 
      attention and working memory updating processes (as indexed by P3). Topographical 
      mapping revealed a typical parietal P3 peak preceded by a prominent 
      fronto-central P3 in normal control subjects (N= 32), whereas FXTAS patients had 
      decreased parietal P3 amplitude and diminished fronto-central positivities with a 
      delayed onset ( approximately 50 ms later than controls, P < 0.002). The P3 abnormalities were 
      associated with lower executive function test (e.g., BDS-2) scores. Smaller P3 
      amplitudes also correlated with increased CGG repeat length of fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) gene and higher FMR1 mRNA levels. These results indicate 
      that abnormal fronto-parietal attentional network dynamics underlie executive 
      dysfunction, the cardinal feature of cognitive impairment in FXTAS.

TI  - Somatic expansion in mouse and human carriers of fragile X premutation alleles.
PG  - 157-66

AB  - Repeat expansion diseases result from expansion of a specific tandem repeat. The 
      three fragile X-related disorders (FXDs) arise from germline expansions of a 
      CGG*CCG repeat tract in the 5' UTR (untranslated region) of the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. We show here that in addition to germline expansion, 
      expansion also occurs in the somatic cells of both mice and humans carriers of 
      premutation alleles. Expansion in mice primarily affects brain, testis, and liver 
      with very little expansion in heart or blood. Our data would be consistent with a 
      simple two-factor model for the organ specificity. Somatic expansion in humans 
      may contribute to the mosaicism often seen in individuals with one of the FXDs. 
      Because expansion risk and disease severity are related to repeat number, somatic 
      expansion may exacerbate disease severity and contribute to the age-related 
      increased risk of expansion seen on paternal transmission in humans. As little 
      somatic expansion occurs in murine lymphocytes, our data also raise the 
      possibility that there may be discordance in humans between repeat numbers 
      measured in blood and that present in brain. This could explain, at least in 
      part, the variable penetrance seen in some of these disorders.

AB  - The fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is an adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by CGG trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 
      fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. The neuropathological hallmark of 
      FXTAS is the presence of ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions in neurons 
      and in astroglia. Intranuclear inclusions have also been reported in the neurons 
      of male CGG KI mice carrying an expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat and used to 
      model FXTAS, but no study has been carried out quantifying inclusions in female 
      CGG KI mice heterozygous for the fragile X premutation. We used histologic and 
      immunocytochemical methods to determine the pathological features of intranuclear 
      inclusions in astroglia and neurons. In female CGG KI mice, ubiquitin-positive 
      intranuclear inclusions were found in neurons and astroglia throughout the brain 
      in cortical and subcortical regions. These inclusions increased in number and 
      became larger with advanced age and increasing CGG repeat length, supporting 
      hypotheses that these pathologic features are progressive across the lifespan. 
      The number of inclusions in neurons was reduced by  approximately 25% in female CGG KI mice 
      compared to male CGG KI mice, but not so low as the 50% predicted. These data 
      emphasize the need to evaluate the neurocognitive and pathological features in 
      female carriers of the fragile X premutation with and without FXTAS 
      symptomatology is warranted, as this population shows similar neuropathological 
      features present in male FXTAS patients.

AB  - The fragile X premutation is a CGG repeat expansion on the FMR1 gene between 55 
      and 200 repeats in length. It has been proposed that impaired spatiotemporal 
      function underlies cognitive deficits in genetic disorders, including the fragile 
      X premutation. This study characterized the role of the premutation for cognitive 
      function by demonstrating CGG KI mice with 70-198 CGG repeats show deficits 
      across tasks requiring spatial and temporal pattern separation. To elucidate 
      mechanisms whereby CGG repeats affect spatiotemporal processing, hippocampal 
      slices were evaluated for LTP, LTD, and mGluR1/5 LTD. Increasing CGG repeat 
      length modulated the induction of LTP, LTD, and mGluR1/5 LTD, as well as 
      behavioral tasks emphasizing spatiotemporal processing. Despite the deficits in 
      the induction of all forms of plasticity, there were no differences in expression 
      of plasticity once evoked. These data provide evidence for a neurocognitive 
      endophenotype in the CGG KI mouse model of the premutation in which CGG repeat 
      length negatively modulates plasticity and spatiotemporal attention.

AB  - The fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (Fmr1) is polymorphic for CGG 
      trinucleotide repeat number in the 5'-untranslated region, with repeat lengths 
      <45 associated with typical development and repeat lengths >200 resulting in 
      hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of the gene and mental retardation 
      in the fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Individuals with CGG repeat expansions between 
      55 and 200 are carriers of the fragile X premutation (PM). PM carriers show a 
      phenotype that can include anxiety, depression, social phobia, and memory 
      deficits. They are also at risk for developing fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome (FXTAS), a late onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
      tremor, ataxia, cognitive impairment, and neuropathologic features including 
      intranuclear inclusions in neurons and astrocytes, loss of Purkinje cells, and 
      white matter disease. However, very little is known about dendritic morphology in 
      PM or in FXTAS. Therefore, we carried out a Golgi study of dendritic complexity 
      and dendritic spine morphology in layer II/III pyramidal neurons in primary 
      visual cortex in a knock-in (KI) mouse model of the PM. These CGG KI mice carry 
      an expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat on Fmr1, and model many features of the PM 
      and FXTAS. Compared to wild-type (WT) mice, CGG KI mice showed fewer dendritic 
      branches proximal to the soma, reduced total dendritic length, and a higher 
      frequency of longer dendritic spines. The distribution of morphologic spine types 
      (e.g., stubby, mushroom, filopodial) did not differ between WT and KI mice. These 
      findings demonstrate that synaptic circuitry is abnormal in visual cortex of mice 
      used to model the PM, and suggest that such changes may underlie neurologic 
      features found in individuals carrying the PM as well as in individuals with 
      FXTAS.

AB  - The primary goal of this study was to calculate the prevalence of the premutation 
      of the FMR1 gene and of the "gray zone" using a population-based sample of older 
      adults in Wisconsin (n = 6,747 samples screened). Compared with past research, 
      prevalence was relatively high (1 in 151 females and 1 in 468 males for the 
      premutation and 1 in 35 females and 1 in 42 males for the gray zone as defined by 
      45-54 CGG repeats). A secondary study goal was to describe characteristics of 
      individuals found to have the premutation (n = 30, 7 males and 23 females). We 
      found that premutation carriers had a significantly higher rate of divorce than 
      controls, as well as higher rates of symptoms that might be indicative of fragile 
      X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS; numbness, dizziness/faintness) and 
      fragile X primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI; age at last menstrual period). 
      Although not statistically significant, premutation carriers were twice as likely 
      to have a child with disability.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fragile X premutations are associated with primary ovarian 
      insufficiency when the patient presents with amenorrhea, but the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) CGG repeat count among cycling women with low ovarian 
      reserve (diminished ovarian reserve [DOR]) is not yet established. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: Sixty-two infertile DOR patients were recruited from 4 US private and 
      academic fertility centers. RESULTS: The prevalence of 35-44 FMR1 CGG repeats was 
      14.5%. Compared with the general female population estimate from the literature, 
      infertile women with DOR were more likely to have 35-44 FMR1 CGG repeats (14.5% 
      and 3.9%, respectively, P = .0003). Similar findings were noted by 5-repeat 
      bandwidth: 35-39 CGG repeats (9.7% DOR vs 3.2% comparison, P = .012) or 40-44 CGG 
      repeats (4.8% DOR vs 0.7% comparison, P = .024). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest 
      that CGG repeats of 35-44 may be markedly overrepresented in women with DOR, 
      whereas the current FMR1 reference range indicates that there is no clinical 
      phenotype with <45 CGG repeats.

AB  - Recently, repeat expansions in several genes have been shown to cause or be 
      associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It has been demonstrated 
      that an intronic hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is a major cause of 
      both familial (approximately 40%) and sporadic (approximately 5%) ALS, as well as 
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In addition, a CAG-repeat expansion in exon 1 of 
      ATXN2, otherwise known to cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, has been 
      identified as a major risk factor for sporadic ALS. Intermediate repeat 
      expansions in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene (55-200 repeats) are 
      known to cause fragile X-associated premature ovarian insufficiency [(FX)POI; 
      female carriers] or fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS; male 
      carriers) by CGG-mediated RNA toxicity. The present investigation involves 
      screening FMR1 repeat length in 742 sporadic ALS patients and 792 matched 
      controls. Our conclusion is that FMR1 repeat expansions are not associated with 
      ALS.

TI  - AGG interruptions within the maternal FMR1 gene reduce the risk of offspring with 
      fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 729-36
LID - 10.1038/gim.2012.34 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The ability to accurately predict the likelihood of expansion of the CGG 
      repeats in the FMR1 gene to a full mutation is of critical importance for genetic 
      counseling of women who are carriers of premutation alleles (55-200 CGG repeats) 
      and who are weighing the risk of having a child with fragile X syndrome. The 
      presence of AGG interruptions within the CGG repeat tract is thought to decrease 
      the likelihood of expansion to a full mutation during transmission, thereby 
      reducing risk, although their contribution has not been quantified. METHODS: We 
      retrospectively analyzed 267 premutation alleles for number and position of AGG 
      interruptions, length of pure CGG repeats, and CGG repeat lengths present in the 
      offspring of the maternal transmissions. In addition, we determined the 
      haplotypes of four markers flanking the 5'-UTR locus in the premutation mothers. 
      RESULTS: We found that the presence of AGG interruptions significantly increased 
      genetic stability, whereas specific haplotypes had a marginal association with 
      transmission instability. CONCLUSION: The presence of AGG interruptions reduced 
      the risk of transmission of a full mutation for all maternal (premutation) repeat 
      lengths below ~100 CGG repeats, with a differential risk (0 vs. 2 AGG) exceeding 
      60% for alleles in the 70- to 80-CGG repeat range.

PG  - 1060-5
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.35275 [doi]
AB  - We reported previously that 10 older men (66.4 +/- 4.6 years) with premutation 
      alleles (55-200 CGG repeats) of the FMR1 gene, with or without FXTAS, had 
      decreased telomere length when compared to sex- and age-matched controls. 
      Extending our use of light intensity measurements from a telomere probe 
      hybridized to interphase preparations, we have now found shortened telomeres in 9 
      younger male premutation carriers (31.7 +/- 17.6 years). We have also shown 
      decreased telomere length in T lymphocytes from 6 male individuals (12.0 +/- 1.8 
      years) with full mutation FMR1 alleles (>200 CGG repeats). These findings support 
      our hypothesis that reduced telomere length is a component of the sub-cellular 
      pathology of FMR1-associated disorders. The experimental approach involved 
      pair-wise comparisons of light intensity values of 20 cells from an individual 
      with either premutation or full mutation CGG-repeat expansions relative to an 
      equivalent number of cells from a sex- and age-matched control. In addition, we 
      demonstrated reduced telomere size in T-lymphocyte cultures from eight 
      individuals with the FMR1 premutation using six different measures. Four relied 
      on detection of light intensity differences, and two involved measuring the whole 
      chromosome, including the telomere, in microns. This new approach confirmed our 
      findings with light intensity measurements and demonstrated the feasibility of 
      direct linear measurements for detecting reductions in telomere size. We have 
      thus confirmed our hypothesis that reduced telomere length is associated with 
      both premutation and full mutation-FMR1 alleles and have demonstrated that direct 
      measurements of telomere length can reliably detect such reductions.

PG  - 2923-35
LID - 10.1093/hmg/dds118 [doi]
AB  - Premutation CGG repeat expansions (55-200 CGG repeats; preCGG) within the fragile 
      X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene cause fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome (FXTAS). Defects in neuronal morphology and migration have been 
      described in a preCGG mouse model. Mouse preCGG hippocampal neurons (170 CGG 
      repeats) grown in vitro develop abnormal networks of clustered burst (CB) firing, 
      as assessed by multielectrode array recordings and clustered patterns of 
      spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations, neither typical of wild-type (WT) neurons. 
      PreCGG neurons have reduced expression of vesicular GABA and glutamate (Glu) 
      transporters (VGAT and VGLUT1, respectively), and preCGG hippocampal astrocytes 
      display a rightward shift on Glu uptake kinetics, compared with WT. These 
      alterations in preCGG astrocytes and neurons are associated with 4- to 8-fold 
      elevated Fmr1 mRNA and occur despite consistent expression of fragile X mental 
      retardation protein levels at  approximately 50% of WT levels. Abnormal patterns of activity 
      observed in preCGG neurons are pharmacologically mimicked in WT neurons by 
      addition of Glu or the mGluR1/5 agonist, dihydroxyphenylglycine, to the medium, 
      or by inhibition of astrocytic Glu uptake with dl-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartic acid, 
      but not by the ionotropic Glu receptor agonists, 
      alpha-2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2-oxazol-4-yl) propanoic acid or 
      N-methyl-d-aspartic acid. The mGluR1 (7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa 
      [b]chromen-1a-carboxylate ethyl ester) or mGluR5 
      (2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride) antagonists reversed CB 
      firing. Importantly, the acute addition of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone 
      mitigated functional impairments observed in preCGG neurons in a reversible 
      manner. These results demonstrate abnormal mGluR1/5 signaling in preCGG neurons, 
      which is ameliorated by mGluR1/5 antagonists or augmentation of GABA(A) receptor 
      signaling, and identify allopregnanolone as a candidate therapeutic lead.

TI  - Gene expression profiles in the cerebellum of transgenic mice over expressing the

AB  - Modifications in the GABA pathway are considered to be responsible for motor 
      alterations in animal models for fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome. We 
      analyzed the expression profile in the cerebellum in a transgenic mouse model 
      that over expresses the human FMR1 gene with CGG repeats in the normal range. We 
      used the "GeneChip Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array" from Affymetrix analyzing 28,853 
      well-described and -characterized genes. Based on data from the comparative 
      analysis of the expression profile, we detected a significant gradient with a P 
      value <0.1 and changes in expression equal to or greater than 1.5 times compared 
      to the control mouse genes. There were significant changes in the expression of 
      104 genes, among which 72% had decreased and 28% had increased expression. With 
      the exception of GabarapL2, no changes in expression of genes from the GABA 
      pathway were observed, which may explain the absence of an altered motor 
      phenotype in these mice. These results further support the view that toxic 
      effects in fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome are due to expansion of 
      CGG repeats rather than increased mRNA levels, since in the transgenic mice the 
      FMR1 mRNA levels were increased 20-100 times compared with those of control 
      littermates.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a developmental disorder caused by the loss of 
      Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) gene function because of a CGG repeat 
      expansion (> 200 repeats) in the gene. The molecular mechanism(s) linking loss of 
      FMR1 function to the molecular pathology and cognitive/behavioral disability 
      remain unclear. Given the critical role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 
      (ERK) in synaptic plasticity and neurodevelopment, a number of recent studies 
      have investigated ERK phosphorylation under basal conditions or upon 
      mGluR-induction using neuronal and peripheral tissues from Fmr1 knockout mice and 
      peripheral tissues from FXS patients. However, these reports have presented 
      conflicting results. The current study is the first to focus on the levels of ERK 
      phosphorylation in brain tissue from human FXS patients. In both human brain 
      tissue and brain tissue from Fmr1 knockout mice there was significantly increased 
      phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK. Indeed, treating Fmr1 knockout mice with the 
      MEK1/2 inhibitor SL327 abrogated audiogenic seizure activity, a feature of the 
      Fmr1 knockout mice that replicates the symptom in patients with FXS. These 
      findings suggest that activation of the ERK pathway results in some cardinal 
      cognitive and clinical features in FXS patients and likely have profound 
      translational implications.

TI  - Screening for FMR1 expanded alleles in patients with parkinsonism in mainland 
      China.
PG  - 16-21
LID - 10.1016/j.neulet.2012.02.036 [doi]
AB  - Expanded alleles of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are generally 
      divided into four classes based on the abundance of unstable CGG repeat 
      expansions (CGGs) in its 5'-untranslated region. It has recently been reported 
      that two of the four classes, premutation (55-200 CGGs) and gray zone (GZ, 40-54 
      CGGs) alleles, was potentially associated with parkinsonism. To investigate this 
      association in patients in mainland China, a total of 360 Chinese patients with 
      parkinsonism and 295 gender and age matched controls were recruited in this 
      study. Indeed, no premutation or full mutation alleles (>200 CGGs) was detected 
      among all the subjects. A total of 11 patients with parkinsonism were identified 
      to have GZ alleles compared with only 1 carrier among the controls (P<0.05). 
      Notably, 10 of the 11 GZ alleles carriers with parkinsonism were female, which 
      was 6.8% of all 147 female patients compared with none in the control females 
      (P<0.05). No significant difference was detected between the male groups of 
      patients and controls. Therefore, our results indicate that FMR1 GZ allele is 
      potentially associated with parkinsonism in mainland China, and the association 
      is only present in the female patients, but not in the male.

PG  - 19-28
LID - 10.1007/s12033-012-9505-z [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the leading cause of inherited mental impairment and is 
      associated with expansions of CGG repeats within the FMR1 gene. To detect 
      expanded CGG repeats, we developed a dual-mode single-molecule fluorescence assay 
      that allows acquisition of two parallel, independent measures of repeat number 
      based on (1) the number of Cy3-labeled probes bound to the repeat region and (2) 
      the physical length of the electric field-linearized repeat region, obtained from 
      the relative position of a single Cy5 dye near the end of the repeat region. 
      Using target strands derived from cell-line DNA with defined numbers of CGG 
      repeats, we show that this assay can rapidly and simultaneously measure the 
      repeats of a collection of individual sample strands within a single field of 
      view. With a low occurrence of false positives, the assay differentiated normal 
      CGG repeat lengths (CGG( N ), N = 23) and expanded CGG repeat lengths (CGG( N ), 
      N = 118), representing a premutation disease state. Further, mixtures of these 
      DNAs gave results that correlated with their relative populations. This strategy 
      may be useful for identifying heterozygosity or for screening collections of 
      individuals, and it is readily adaptable for screening other repeat disorders.

TI  - Capturing the fragile X premutation phenotypes: a collaborative effort across 
      multiple cohorts.
PG  - 156-64
LID - 10.1037/a0026799 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To capture the neuropsychological profile among male carriers of the 
      FMR1 premutation allele (55-200 CGG repeats) who do not meet diagnostic criteria 
      for the late-onset fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, FXTAS. METHOD: We 
      have initiated a multicenter collaboration that includes 3 independent cohorts, 
      totaling 100 carriers of the premutation and 216 noncarriers. The initial focus 
      of this collaboration has been on executive function. Four executive function 
      scores are shared among the 3 cohorts (Controlled Oral Word Association Test, 
      Stroop Color-Word Test, and Wechsler backward digit span and letter-number 
      sequencing) whereas additional executive function scores are available for 
      specific cohorts (Behavior Dyscontrol Scale, Hayling Sentence Completion Test 
      Part B, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test). Raw scores were analyzed by using 
      statistical models that adjust for cohort-specific effects as well as age and 
      education. RESULTS: Carriers scored significantly lower compared to noncarriers 
      on the Stroop Color-Word Test (p = .01), Hayling Sentence Completion Test Part B 
      (p < .01), and Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale (p = .03), with the Hayling displaying 
      a significant age-related decline (p = .01), as assessed by an age and repeat 
      length-group interaction. Follow-up analysis of the collective data did not 
      identify any specific age groups or repeat length ranges (i.e., low premutation = 
      55-70 repeats, midpremutation = 71-100 repeats, high premutation = 101-199 
      repeats) that were associated with an increased risk of executive function 
      deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary analyses do not indicate global executive 
      function impairment among male carriers without FXTAS compared to noncarriers. 
      However, impairment in inhibitory capacity may be present among a subset of 
      carriers, though the risk factors for this group do not appear to be related to 
      age or repeat length.

AB  - PURPOSE: The College of American Pathologists offers biannual proficiency testing 
      for molecular analysis of fragile X syndrome. The purpose of this study was to 
      analyze laboratory performance on the fragile X proficiency surveys from 2001 to 
      2009. METHODS: Individual laboratory responses were analyzed for accuracy of 
      genotype determination (normal, gray zone, premutation, or full mutation) and 
      size analysis of the FMR1 trinucleotide repeat region. The analytical sensitivity 
      and specificity of testing for fragile X were calculated, and laboratory 
      performance for trinucleotide repeat sizing was evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, 
      laboratories demonstrated analytical sensitivity of 99% and 96% for detection of 
      full mutations associated with fragile X syndrome in males and females, 
      respectively; analytical sensitivity of 98% for detection of premutations; and 
      analytical specificity of 99.9%. Size measurements of the CGG repeat region were 
      acceptable from most laboratories, with an increase in the range of reported 
      sizes observed for larger repeat expansions. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular genetic 
      testing for fragile X syndrome demonstrated excellent sensitivity and specificity 
      by laboratories participating in the College of American Pathologists (CAP) 
      surveys. Allele sizing demonstrated good performance overall with improved 
      accuracy over the study period. Participation in proficiency testing can aid 
      laboratories in assessing individual performance and need for calibration of 
      assays.

AB  - AIMS: Most individuals with intellectual disability and/or autism are tested for 
      Fragile X syndrome at some point in their lifetime. Greater than 99% of 
      individuals with Fragile X have an expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat motif in the 
      promoter region of the FMR1 gene, and diagnostic testing involves determining the 
      size of the CGG repeat as well as methylation status when an expansion is 
      present. RESULTS: Using a previously described triplet repeat-primed polymerase 
      chain reaction, we have performed additional validation studies using two cohorts 
      with previous diagnostic testing results available for comparison purposes. The 
      first cohort (n=88) consisted of both males and females and had a high percentage 
      of abnormal samples, while the second cohort (n=624) consisted of only females 
      and was not enriched for expansion mutations. Data from each cohort were 
      completely concordant with the results previously obtained during the course of 
      diagnostic testing. CONCLUSIONS: This study further demonstrates the utility of 
      using laboratory-developed triplet repeat-primed FMR1 testing in a clinical 
      setting.

TI  - Screening for CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene by melting curve analysis of 
      combined 5' and 3' direct triplet-primed PCRs.
PG  - 568-79
LID - 10.1373/clinchem.2011.174615 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: CGG repeat expansions in the FMR1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) 
      gene are associated with fragile X syndrome, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome, and fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency. We evaluated 
      the use of melting curve analysis (MCA) of triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) assays as 
      a rapid screening tool for the positive identification of expanded FMR1 alleles 
      in men and women. METHODS: Both 5'- and 3'-weighted direct TP-PCRs (dTP-PCRs) 
      were evaluated on 29 cell line-derived DNA samples and 44 blinded clinical 
      samples. The presence of expansions was identified by the melting curve profiles 
      generated automatically through MCA on the LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System. 
      All samples were also analyzed by capillary electrophoresis to confirm the 
      identities of the PCR fragments that gave rise to the observed melt peak 
      profiles. RESULTS: The presence of expanded alleles in samples from both males 
      and females produced melt peak profiles that were distinct from those of 
      individuals with the normal allelic form. In the blinded test, positive and 
      negative calls for the presence of an expanded allele corroborated with 
      previously determined genotype classifications for all samples. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      approach of dTP-PCR plus MCA offers a single-step strategy with high diagnostic 
      sensitivity and specificity for rapid screening detection of FMR1 CGG repeat 
      expansions, regardless of sex. The combined use of 5'- and 3'-weighted dTP-PCR 
      assays minimizes the incidence of false-negative results arising from 
      repeat-flanking deletions.

TI  - Single nucleotide polymorphism and FMR1 CGG repeat instability in two Basque 
      valleys.
PG  - 110-20
LID - 10.1111/j.1469-1809.2011.00696.x [doi]
AB  - Fragile X Syndrome (FXS, MIM 309550) is mainly due to the expansion of a CGG 
      trinucleotide repeat sequence, found in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 
      gene. Some studies suggest that stable markers, such as single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) and the study of populations with genetic identity, could 
      provide a distinct advance to investigate the origin of CGG repeat instability. 
      In this study, seven SNPs (WEX28 rs17312728:G>T, WEX70 rs45631657:C>T, WEX1 
      rs10521868:A>C, ATL1 rs4949:A>G, FMRb rs25707:A>G, WEX17 rs12010481:C>T and WEX10 
      ss71651741:C>T) have been analyzed in two Basque valleys (Markina and Arratia). 
      We examined the association between these SNPs and the CGG repeat size, the AGG 
      interruption pattern and two microsatellite markers (FRAXAC1 and DXS548). The 
      results suggest that in both valleys WEX28-T, WEX70-C, WEX1-C, ATL1-G, and 
      WEX10-C are preferably associated with cis-acting sequences directly influencing 
      instability. But comparison of the two valleys reveals also important differences 
      with respect to: (1) frequency and structure of "susceptible" alleles and (2) 
      association between "susceptible" alleles and STR and SNP haplotypes. These 
      results may indicate that, in Arratia, SNP status does not identify a pool of 
      susceptible alleles, as it does in Markina. In Arratia valley, the SNP haplotype 
      association reveals also a potential new "protective" factor.

TI  - FOXE1 polyalanine tract length screening by MLPA in idiopathic premature ovarian 
      failure.
PG  - 158
LID - 10.1186/1477-7827-9-158 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: FOXE1 is one of the candidate genes for genetic predisposition to 
      premature ovarian failure (POF) and it contains an alanine tract. Our purpose is 
      to assess the influence of length of the alanine tract of FOXE1 on genetic 
      susceptibility to POF. METHODS: The group studied consisted of 110 Chinese 
      patients with idiopathic POF and 110 women from normal controls. The polyalanine 
      tract and flanking sequence of FOXE1 was screened using the Multiple 
      Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) technique and directly sequenced. 
      RESULTS: Three variants of FOXE1-polyalanine length, containing 12, 14, or 16 
      alanine residues, and 5 different genotypes were identified. There were 
      significantly lower frequencies of the 14/14 genotypes in cases with POF (X2 = 
      119.73, P = 0.001), as compared with the controls. The incidence of 16/16 
      genotypes of FOXE1-polyalanine was significantly higher in patients with POF (X2 
      = 3.403, P = 0.001) in comparison to the controls. The FOXE1 14 alanine allele 
      was significantly less common in the POF patient group (186/220) than the 
      controls (216/220) (X2 = 25.923, P = 0.0001). The FOXE1 16 alanine allele was 
      significantly more common in the POF patient group (28/220) than the controls 
      (4/220) (X2 = 19.412, P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: This finding provides evidence 
      that polyalanine repeat expansions in FOXE1 may be responsible for the genetic 
      aetiology of POF in Chinese women.

TI  - Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome in FMR1 gray zone allele carriers.
PG  - 296-300
LID - 10.1002/mds.24021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carriers of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) repeat expansions 
      in the premutation range (55-200 CGG repeats) often develop a syndrome of kinetic 
      tremor, cerebellar ataxia, and parkinsonism; designated the fragile X-associated 
      tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Neurological signs have not been reported in 
      carriers of gray zone (45-54 CGG repeats) expansions. METHODS/RESULTS: We 
      describe 3 patients with FMR1 gray zone alleles who meet diagnostic criteria for 
      FXTAS. CONCLUSIONS: Our cases suggest that the definition of the FXTAS may need 
      to be broadened to include individuals with FMR1 repeat expansions in the gray 
      zone. These neurological signs may be due to elevated levels of expanded CGG 
      repeat FMR1 mRNA in the gray zone carriers, similar to the changes seen in 
      premutation carriers with FXTAS.

TI  - Differential sensitivity to life stress in FMR1 premutation carrier mothers of 
      children with fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 612-22
LID - 10.1037/a0026528 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The premutation of the FMR1 gene (defined as between 55 and 200 CGG 
      repeats) is estimated to affect 1 in 149 females and 1 in 643 males, and some 
      people who carry the FMR1 premutation display signs of impairment. METHOD: This 
      study focuses on 82 premutation carrier mothers (M age = 51.4 years; SD = 7.7) of 
      adolescent and adult children with fragile X syndrome (FXS). A Gene x Environment 
      interaction approach examined the ways in which the experience of negative life 
      events interacts with genetic vulnerability to predict depressive symptoms, 
      anxiety, and daily cortisol levels. RESULTS: The associations of life events with 
      all 3 dependent measures were associated with CGG repeat length but in a 
      curvilinear manner. Mothers with midsize CGG repeats who experienced 
      above-average numbers of negative life events in the previous year had more 
      depressive symptoms and anxiety and had a blunted cortisol awakening response, as 
      compared with those with higher or lower repeat lengths. However, mothers with 
      midsize CGG repeats who experienced below-average numbers of negative life events 
      in the previous year had the lowest levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety, 
      and they exhibited the typical cortisol response to awakening, meeting the 
      criteria for differential susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: This research extends our 
      understanding of the phenotypic effects of the expansion of the FMR1 gene, and it 
      adds to the growing literature on the curvilinear relationship between CGG repeat 
      length and mental and physical health.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual 
      disability. In addition to cognitive deficits, FXS patients exhibit 
      hyperactivity, attention deficits, social difficulties, anxiety, and other 
      autistic-like behaviors. FXS is caused by an expanded CGG trinucleotide repeat in 
      the 5' untranslated region of the Fragile X Mental Retardation (FMR1) gene 
      leading to epigenetic silencing and loss of expression of the Fragile X Mental 
      Retardation protein (FMRP). Despite the known relationship between FMR1 CGG 
      repeat expansion and FMR1 silencing, the epigenetic modifications observed at the 
      FMR1 locus, and the consequences of the loss of FMRP on human neurodevelopment 
      and neuronal function remain poorly understood. To address these limitations, we 
      report on the generation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from 
      multiple patients with FXS and the characterization of their differentiation into 
      post-mitotic neurons and glia. We show that clones from reprogrammed FXS patient 
      fibroblast lines exhibit variation with respect to the predominant CGG-repeat 
      length in the FMR1 gene. In two cases, iPSC clones contained predominant 
      CGG-repeat lengths shorter than measured in corresponding input population of 
      fibroblasts. In another instance, reprogramming a mosaic patient having both 
      normal and pre-mutation length CGG repeats resulted in genetically matched iPSC 
      clonal lines differing in FMR1 promoter CpG methylation and FMRP expression. 
      Using this panel of patient-specific, FXS iPSC models, we demonstrate aberrant 
      neuronal differentiation from FXS iPSCs that is directly correlated with 
      epigenetic modification of the FMR1 gene and a loss of FMRP expression. Overall, 
      these findings provide evidence for a key role for FMRP early in human 
      neurodevelopment prior to synaptogenesis and have implications for modeling of 
      FXS using iPSC technology. By revealing disease-associated cellular phenotypes in 
      human neurons, these iPSC models will aid in the discovery of novel therapeutics 
      for FXS and other autism-spectrum disorders sharing common pathophysiology.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS; MIM #300624), a well-recognized form of inherited human 
      mental retardation is caused, in most cases, by a CGG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in the 5'-untranslated region of FMR1, resulting in reduced expression 
      of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Clinical features include 
      macroorchidism, anxiety, mental retardation, motor coordination, and speech 
      articulation deficits. The Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1-KO) mouse, a mouse model for FXS, 
      has been shown to replicate the macroorchidism, cognitive deficits, and 
      neuroanatomical abnormalities found in human FXS. Here we asked whether Fmr1-KO 
      mice also display appendicular and oromotor deficits comparable to the ataxia and 
      dysarthric speech seen in FXS patients. We employed standard motor tests for 
      balance and appendicular motor coordination, and used a novel long-term 
      fluid-licking assay to investigate oromotor function in Fmr1-KO mice and their 
      wild-type (WT) littermates. Fmr1-KO mice performed equally well as their WT 
      littermates on standard motor tests, with the exception of a raised-beam task. 
      However, Fmr1-KO mice had a significantly slower licking rhythm than their WT 
      littermates. Deficits in rhythmic fluid-licking in Fmr1-KO mice have been linked 
      to cerebellar pathologies. It is believed that balance and motor coordination 
      deficits in FXS patients are caused by cerebellar neurophathologies. The neuronal 
      bases of speech articulation deficits in FXS patients are currently unknown. It 
      is yet to be established whether similar neuronal circuits control rhythmic 
      fluid-licking pattern in mice and speech articulation movement in humans.

TI  - Number of CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene of Japanese patients with primary ovarian 
      insufficiency.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the number of CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene of Japanese 
      patients with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and normal controls. DESIGN: 
      Retrospective, controlled cohort study. SETTING: Outpatient department of an 
      academic tertiary center. PATIENT(S): One hundred twenty-eight consecutive 
      Japanese patients with sporadic, nonsyndromic POI and 98 controls with normal 
      menstruation. INTERVENTION(S): Deoxyribonucleic acid was obtained from the plasma 
      of each subject. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Differences in the distribution of CGG 
      repeat numbers between patients with POI and controls. RESULT(S): Six alleles in 
      the intermediate range and two in the premutation range were found in five and 
      two patients with POI, respectively, but none were identified in normal controls. 
      The prevalence of FMR1 premutation among Japanese POI patients was 1.56% (2 of 
      128). The prevalence of having >36 CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene was significantly 
      higher in patients with POI than in controls, and age at the onset of amenorrhea 
      was significantly lower in patients with >38 repeats. CONCLUSION(S): More than 36 
      CGG repeats in the FMR1 might intensify the etiology of POI, at least up to the 
      premutation range.

AB  - The high frequency of the fragile X premutation in the general population and its 
      emerging neurocognitive implications highlight the need to investigate the 
      effects of the premutation on lifespan cognitive development. Until recently, 
      cognitive function in fragile X premutation carriers (fXPCs) was presumed to be 
      unaffected by the mutation. Although as a group fXPCs did not differ from healthy 
      controls (HCs), we show that young adult female fXPCs show subtle age- and 
      significant fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene mutation-modulated 
      cognitive function as tested by a basic numerical enumeration task. These results 
      indicate that older women with the premutation and fXPCs with greater CGG repeat 
      lengths were at higher risk for difficulties in the deployment of volitional 
      attention required to count 5-8 items, but spared performance when spatial shifts 
      of attention were minimized to subitize a few (1-3). Results from the current 
      study add to a growing body of evidence that suggests the premutation allele is 
      associated with a subtle phenotype and implies that the cognitive demands 
      necessary for counting are less effectively deployed in female fXPCs compared to 
      HCs.

TI  - Spatial code recognition in neuronal RNA targeting: role of RNA-hnRNP A2 
      interactions.
PG  - 441-57
LID - 10.1083/jcb.201010027 [doi]
AB  - In neurons, regulation of gene expression occurs in part through translational 
      control at the synapse. A fundamental requirement for such local control is the 
      targeted delivery of select neuronal mRNAs and regulatory RNAs to distal 
      dendritic sites. The nature of spatial RNA destination codes, and the mechanism 
      by which they are interpreted for dendritic delivery, remain poorly understood. 
      We find here that in a key dendritic RNA transport pathway (exemplified by BC1 
      RNA, a dendritic regulatory RNA, and protein kinase M zeta [PKMzeta] mRNA, a dendritic 
      mRNA), noncanonical purine*purine nucleotide interactions are functional 
      determinants of RNA targeting motifs. These motifs are specifically recognized by 
      heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 (hnRNP A2), a trans-acting factor 
      required for dendritic delivery. Binding to hnRNP A2 and ensuing dendritic 
      delivery are effectively competed by RNAs with CGG triplet repeat expansions. CGG 
      repeats, when expanded in the 5' untranslated region of fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) mRNA, cause fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. The 
      data suggest that cellular dysregulation observed in the presence of CGG repeat 
      RNA may result from molecular competition in neuronal RNA transport pathways.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study determined whether CGG repeat length moderates the 
      relationship between age and performance on selective measures of executive 
      function in premutation carriers (PM) who are asymptomatic for a recently 
      described late-onset neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). METHODS: Forty PM men aged 18-69 years with a 
      family history of fragile X syndrome underwent neuropsychological tests of 
      inhibition and working memory. We examined only men who are asymptomatic for 
      FXTAS. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the moderating role 
      of CGG repeat length on the relation between age and performance on inhibition 
      and working memory tasks. RESULTS: With increasing age and only in men with an 
      FMR1 expansion in the upper premutation range (>100 CGG repeats) was there an 
      association between age and poorer task performance on selective executive 
      function measures involving inhibition (p < 0.05) and executive working memory (p 
      < 0.01). Men in the lower premutation range (<100 CGG repeats) were relatively 
      risk-free from any cognitive aging effects associated with CGG repeat expansions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that neural networks in the prefrontal cortex may be 
      highly susceptible to age-related neurotoxic effects in the upper size range of 
      the FMR1 premutation. Future longitudinal studies will be needed to determine 
      whether specific executive markers may serve to distinguish those at greatest 
      risk for severe cognitive decline or dementia associated with FXTAS.

TI  - FMR1 CGG repeat lengths mediate different regulation of reporter gene expression 
      in comparative transient and locus specific integration assays.

AB  - The Fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene contains a polymorphic CGG 
      trinucleotide repeat in the 5'-untranslated region. The repeat length in the 
      normal population is between 5 and 54 repeats. A repeat length between 55 and 200 
      is defined as the pre-mutation repeat size. Elderly carriers of the pre-mutation 
      can develop the progressive neurodegenerative disease Fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). In FXTAS the FMR1 mRNA levels are increased and 
      it is hypothesized that FXTAS is caused by a RNA gain of function mechanism. 
      Repeat lengths beyond 200 CGGs are defined as the full-mutation and causes 
      Fragile X-syndrome which is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. 
      The full-mutation results in the absence of the FMR1 mRNA and protein, FMRP, 
      through abnormal CpG methylation and FMR1 gene silencing. In this report we have 
      used the Flp-In T-REx system to generate locus directed stable cell lines 
      harboring the FMR1 5'-UTR with varying CGG repeat lengths in front of a reporter 
      gene. By this system the influence of various CGG repeat lengths for reporter 
      gene expression can be comparatively examined in cell lines where the only 
      genetic difference is CGG repeat lengths. In such cell lines we find that a 
      full-mutation CGG repeat confers inhibition of reporter gene expression, whereas 
      a pre-mutation CGG repeat did not increase reporter gene expression. In transient 
      transfection assays using the same expression vectors the pre-mutation and 
      full-mutation CGG repeats increased reporter gene expression. This study shows 
      that locus directed integration of model FMR1 CGG transgenes could be a new basic 
      tool to further elucidating the basic molecular mechanisms behind transcriptional 
      deregulation of the FMR1 gene in fragile X-syndrome and FXTAS.

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects males who are carriers of a 
      premutation of a CGG expansion in the FMR1 gene. In Asian populations, FXTAS has 
      rarely been reported. Here, we report the case of a Japanese FXTAS patient who 
      showed predominant executive cognitive deficits as the main feature of his 
      disease. In contrast, the patient exhibited only very mild symptoms of intention 
      tremor and ataxia, which did not interfere with daily activities. A gene analysis 
      revealed that the patient carried a premutation of a CGG expansion (111 CGG 
      repeats) in the FMR1 gene. The mRNA expression level of FMR1 in the patient was 
      1.5-fold higher than in controls. On brain MRI scans, fluid-attenuated inversion 
      recovery images showed high-intensity lesions in the middle cerebellar peduncles 
      and the cerebral white matter, with a frontal predominance. The present case 
      extends previous notions regarding the cognitive impairment in FXTAS patients. 
      Recognizing FXTAS patients with predominant cognitive impairment from various 
      ethnic backgrounds would contribute to our understanding of the phenotypic 
      variation of this disease.

TI  - Treatment effects of stimulant medication in young boys with fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 175-84
LID - 10.1007/s11689-011-9085-4 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual 
      disability and is caused by a CGG repeat expansion at Xq27.3 on the FMR1 gene. 
      The majority of young boys with FXS display poor attention and hyperactivity that 
      is disproportionate to their cognitive disability, and approximately 70% meet 
      diagnostic criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. 
      Psychopharmacology is employed with 82% of young males 5-17 years of age, with 
      stimulant medication as the most common medication prescribed. This study 
      evaluated the effects of stimulant medication on the academic performance, 
      attention, motor activity, and psychophysiological arousal of boys with FXS, as 
      well as the concordance of effects within individuals. Participants in this study 
      included 12 boys with FXS who were treated with stimulants. Participants 
      completed videotaped academic testing on two consecutive days and were randomly 
      assigned to be off stimulants for 1 day and on stimulants the other day. On each 
      day, multiple measures including academic performance, behavior regulation, and 
      psychophysiological arousal were collected. Approximately 75% of participants 
      performed better on attention and academic measures, and 70% showed improved 
      physiological regulation while on stimulant medication. A high degree of 
      concordance among measures was found. Lower intelligence quotient (IQ), but not 
      age, correlated with greater improvements in in-seat behavior. IQ and age did not 
      relate to on-task behaviors. The frequency and magnitude of response to stimulant 
      medication in boys with FXS is higher than those reported for most children with 
      non-specific intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder.

TI  - Increased frequency of occult fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency 
      in infertile women with evidence of impaired ovarian function.
PG  - 2077-83
LID - 10.1093/humrep/der168 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The FMR1 premutation is associated with overt primary ovarian 
      insufficiency (POI). However, its prevalence in women with occult POI (i.e. 
      menstrual cycles, but impaired ovarian response) has not been examined. We 
      hypothesized that both the FMR1 premutation and intermediate allele is more 
      frequent in infertile women with occult POI than in controls, and that a repeat 
      length cutoff might predict occult POI. METHODS: All subjects were menstruating 
      women <42 years old and with no family history of unexplained mental retardation, 
      autism or fragile X syndrome. Cases had occult POI defined by elevated FSH or 
      poor response to gonadotrophin therapy (n = 535). Control subjects (n = 521) had 
      infertility from other causes or were oocyte donors. Prevalence of the FMR1 
      premutation and intermediate alleles was examined and allele length was compared 
      between controls and women with occult POI. RESULTS: The frequency of the 
      premutation (7/535 versus 1/521; P< 0.05) and intermediate alleles (17/535 versus 
      7/521; P< 0.05) was higher in women with occult POI than in controls. The allele 
      with the greatest number of CGG repeats was longer in women with occult POI 
      compared with controls (32.7 +/- 7.1 versus 31.6 +/- 4.3; P < 0.01). A receiver 
      operating characteristic curve examining repeat length as a test for occult POI 
      had an area of 0.56 +/- 0.02 (P < 0.01). A repeat cutoff of 45 had a specificity of 
      98%, but a sensitivity of only 5% to identify occult POI. The positive predictive 
      value was only 21% for a fertility population that has  approximately  22% of its patients with 
      occult POI. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that FMR1 premutations and intermediate 
      alleles are increased in women with occult POI. Thus, FMR1 testing should be 
      performed in these women as some will have fragileX-associated POI. Although the 
      FMR1 repeat lengths were longer in women with occult POI, the data do not support 
      the use of a repeat length cutoff to predict occult POI.

TI  - Subchronic administration and combination metabotropic glutamate and GABAB 
      receptor drug therapy in fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 897-905
LID - 10.1124/jpet.111.183327 [doi]
AB  - The most common cause of inherited mental retardation, fragile X syndrome, 
      results from a triplet repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene and loss of the mRNA 
      binding protein, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). In the absence of 
      FMRP, signaling through group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) is 
      enhanced. We previously proposed a mechanism whereby the audiogenic seizures 
      exhibited by FMR1 null mice result from an imbalance in excitatory mGluR and 
      inhibitory GABA(B) receptor (GABA(B)R) signaling (Mol Pharmacol 76:18-24, 2009). 
      Here, we tested the mGluR5-positive allosteric modulator 
      3-cyano-N-(1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)benzamide (CDPPB), the mGluR5 inverse 
      agonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP), and GABA(B) receptor agonists, 
      alone and in combination on receptor protein expression and audiogenic seizures 
      in FMR1 mice. Single doses of MPEP (30 mg/kg), the GABA(B)R orthosteric agonist 
      R-baclofen (1 mg/kg), or the GABA(B)R-positive allosteric modulator 
      N,N'-dicyclopentyl-2-(methylthio)-5-nitro-4,6-pyrimidine diamine (GS-39783) (30 
      mg/kg), reduced the incidence of seizures. However, when administered 
      subchronically (daily injections for 6 days), MPEP retained its anticonvulsant 
      activity, whereas R-baclofen and GS-39783 did not. When administered at lower 
      doses that had no effect when given alone, a single injection of MPEP plus 
      R-baclofen also reduced seizures, but the effect was lost after subchronic 
      administration. We were surprised to find that subchronic treatment with 
      R-baclofen also induced tolerance to a single high dose of MPEP. These data 
      demonstrate that tolerance develops rapidly to the antiseizure properties of 
      R-baclofen alone and R-baclofen coadministered with MPEP, but not with MPEP 
      alone. Our findings suggest that cross-talk between the G-protein signaling

PG  - 211-24
LID - 10.1007/s11689-011-9084-5 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by an expanded CGG repeat (>200 repeats) in 
      the 5' un-translated portion of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) 
      leading to a deficiency or absence of the FMR1 protein (FMRP). FMRP is an 
      RNA-binding protein that regulates the translation of a number of other genes 
      that are important for synaptic development and plasticity. Furthermore, many of 
      these genes, when mutated, have been linked to autism in the general population, 
      which may explain the high comorbidity that exists between FXS and autism 
      spectrum disorders (ASD). Additionally, premutation repeat expansions (55 to 200 
      CGG repeats) may also give rise to ASD through a different molecular mechanism 
      that involves a direct toxic effect of FMR1 mRNA. It is believed that RNA 
      toxicity underlies much of the premutation-related involvement, including 
      developmental concerns like autism, as well as neurodegenerative issues with 
      aging such as the fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). RNA 
      toxicity can also lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is common in older 
      premutation carriers both with and without FXTAS. Many of the problems with 
      cellular dysregulation in both premutation and full mutation neurons also 
      parallel the cellular abnormalities that have been documented in idiopathic 
      autism. Research regarding dysregulation of neurotransmitter systems caused by 
      the lack of FMRP in FXS, including metabotropic glutamate receptor 1/5 (mGluR1/5) 
      pathway and GABA pathways, has led to new targeted treatments for FXS. 
      Preliminary evidence suggests that these new targeted treatments will also be 
      beneficial in non-fragile X forms of autism.

TI  - Crystal structures of CGG RNA repeats with implications for fragile X-associated 
      tremor ataxia syndrome.
PG  - 7308-15
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkr368 [doi]
AB  - The CGG repeats are present in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the fragile 
      X mental retardation gene FMR1 and are associated with two diseases: fragile 
      X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and fragile X syndrome (FXS). FXTAS 
      occurs when the number of repeats is 55-200 and FXS develops when the number 
      exceeds 200. FXTAS is an RNA-mediated disease in which the expanded CGG tracts 
      form stable structures and sequester important RNA binding proteins. We obtained 
      and analysed three crystal structures of double-helical CGG repeats involving 
      unmodified and 8-Br modified guanosine residues. Despite the presence of the 
      non-canonical base pairs, the helices retain an A-form. In the G-G pairs one 
      guanosine is always in the syn conformation, the other is anti. There are two 
      hydrogen bonds between the Watson-Crick edge of G(anti) and the Hoogsteen edge of 
      G(syn): O6.N1H and N7.N2H. The G(syn)-G(anti) pair shows affinity for binding 
      ions in the major groove. G(syn) causes local unwinding of the helix, compensated 
      elsewhere along the duplex. CGG helical structures appear relatively stable 
      compared with CAG and CUG tracts. This could be an important factor in the RNA's 
      ligand binding affinity and specificity.

TI  - Rare intranuclear inclusions in the brains of 3 older adult males with fragile x 
      syndrome: implications for the spectrum of fragile x-associated disorders.
PG  - 462-9
LID - 10.1097/NEN.0b013e31821d3194 [doi]
AB  - The FMR1 gene is polymorphic for the length of CGG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions in the 5' untranslated region. Premutation (55-200 CGG repeats) and 
      full-mutation (>200 CGG repeats) alleles give rise to their respective disorders 
      by different pathogenic mechanisms: RNA gain-of-function toxicity leads to 
      fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome in the premutation range, and 
      transcriptional silencing and absence of fragile X mental retardation protein 
      (FMRP) lead to fragile X syndrome in the full-mutation range. However, for the 
      latter, incomplete silencing and/or size-mosaicism might result in some 
      contribution to the disease process from residual messenger RNA production. To 
      address this possibility, we examined the brains of 3 cases of fragile X syndrome 
      for the presence of intranuclear inclusions in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. We 
      identified low levels (0.1%-1.3%) of intranuclear inclusions in all 3 cases. 
      Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for FMR1 messenger 
      RNA and immunofluorescence for FMRP revealed low but detectable levels of both 
      RNA and protein in the 3 cases, consistent with the presence of small numbers of 
      inclusions. The intranuclear inclusions were only present in FMRP-immunoreactive 
      cells. The small numbers of inclusions and very low levels of both FMR1 RNA and 
      protein suggest that the clinical course in these 3 subjects would not have been 
      influenced by contributions from RNA toxicity.

PG  - 1900-6

AB  - Carriers of fragile X mental retardation 1 repeat expansions in the premutation 
      range (55-200 CGG repeats), especially males, often develop tremor, ataxia, and 
      parkinsonism. These neurological signs are believed to be a result of elevated 
      levels of expanded CGG-repeat fragile X mental retardation 1 mRNA. The purpose of 
      this study was to determine the prevalence of fragile X mental retardation 1 
      repeat expansions in a movement disorder population comprising subjects with all 
      types of tremor, ataxia, and parkinsonism. We screened 335 consecutive patients 
      with tremor, ataxia, or parkinsonism and 273 controls confirmed to have no 
      movement disorders. There was no difference in fragile X mental retardation 1 
      premutation size expansions in the cases compared with controls. Eleven percent 
      of the women with Parkinson's disease had fragile X mental retardation 1 
      gray-zone expansions compared with 4.4% of female controls (odds ratio of 3.2; 
      95% confidence interval, 1.2-8.7). Gray-zone expansions in patients with other 
      phenotypes were not overrepresented in comparison with controls. Fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 premutation range expansions are not more common in a mixed 
      movement disorder population compared with controls. Our results, however, 
      suggest that fragile X mental retardation 1 gray-zone alleles may be associated 
      with Parkinson's disease in women.

AB  - The expansion of CGG repeats in the 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR) of FMR1 gene 
      is the molecular basis of fragile X syndrome in most of the patients. The nature 
      of the flanking sequences in addition to the length and interruption pattern of 
      repeats is predicted to influence CGG repeat instability in the FMR1 gene. We 
      investigated nucleosome occupancy as a contributor to CGG repeat instability in a 
      transgenic mouse model containing unstable (CGG)(26,) from human FMR1 cloned 
      downstream of nucleosome-excluding sequence. We observe that the transgene has an 
      open chromatin structure compared to the stable endogenous mouse Fmr1 within the 
      same nucleus. CGG repeats in mouse Fmr1 are flanked by nucleosomes unlike the 
      repeats in the transgene in all the tissues examined. Further in vitro chromatin 
      reconstitution experiments show that DNA fragment without the SV40ori/EPR 
      (nucleosome-excluding sequence) forms more stable chromatin than the one 
      containing it, despite having the same number of CGG repeats. The correlation 
      between nucleosomal organisation of the FMR1 gene and CGG repeat instability was 
      supported by significantly lower frequency of repeat expansion in mice containing 
      an identical transgene without the SV40ori/EPR. Our studies demonstrate that 
      flanking DNA sequences can influence repeat instability through modulation of 
      nucleosome occupancy in the region.

AB  - The Fragile X syndrome is caused by a CGG repeat expansion >200 in the promoter 
      of the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene termed full mutation (FM). 
      These alleles are silenced through methylation of the FMR1 promoter, leading to 
      deficit of the FMR1 protein (FMRP), and neurodevelopmental changes. However, 
      occasional FM individuals have a complete lack of methylation, and those 
      typically have only minor deficit of FMRP levels compared with normal controls 
      and their intelligence may be in the normal range. FM alleles are generated 
      through expansion of the CGG repeat from the premutation (PM) range of 55-200 
      repeats, linked to the late onset Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS). This disorder has been attributed to a 'toxicity' of the FMR1 mRNA, 
      which is significantly elevated in male carriers of PM alleles and of 
      unmethylated FM alleles. This is the first report of a 65-year-old male with an 
      unmethylated FM allele and history of alcohol abuse, who developed symptoms of 
      FXTAS. We postulate that, although the elevation of FMR1 transcripts associated 
      with unmethylated FM alleles have a potential to cause FXTAS, in some cases this 
      disorder may occur through an additional effect of exposure to neurotoxicants 
      including alcohol.

AB  - Examples of white matter hyperintensities (wmh) on magnetic resonance images in a 
      basis pontis are presented in two male carriers, each of whom carry a small CGG 
      expansion fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) allele. One carried a premutation 
      (PM) allele of 85 CGG repeats and the other, a gray zone (GZ) allele of 47 
      repeats. Both were originally diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease 
      (iPD). Similar changes are also shown in one PM carrier of 99 repeats affected 
      with mild tremor and imbalance, who was ascertained through a fragile X syndrome 
      family. These examples draw attention to the occurrence of wmh in a basis pontis 
      in the carriers of small CGG expansions presenting with tremor and ataxia. 
      Moreover, the presence of this change in GZ, as well as PM, allele carriers 
      originally diagnosed with iPD supports our earlier suggestion that both these 
      alleles may contribute to the neurodegenerative changes in this disorder which, 
      in the examples presented, have been reflected by wmh, most prominent in the 
      cerebellar peduncles and/or pontine area.

TI  - High-resolution methylation polymerase chain reaction for fragile X analysis: 
      evidence for novel FMR1 methylation patterns undetected in Southern blot 
      analyses.
PG  - 528-538
LID - 10.1097/GIM.0b013e31820a780f [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Fragile X syndrome is associated with the expansion of CGG trinucleotide 
      repeats and subsequent methylation of the FMR1 gene. Molecular diagnosis of 
      fragile X currently requires Southern blot analysis to assess methylation. This 
      study describes the evaluation of a polymerase chain reaction-only workflow for 
      the determination of methylation status across a broad range of FMR1 genotypes in 
      male and female specimens. METHODS: We evaluated a novel method that combines 
      allele-specific methylation polymerase chain reaction and capillary 
      electrophoresis with eight cell line and 80 clinical samples, including 39 full 
      mutations. Methylation status was determined using a three-step workflow: (1) 
      differential treatment of genomic DNA using a methylation-sensitive restriction 
      enzyme; (2) polymerase chain reaction with two sets of dye-tagged primers; and 
      (3) amplicon sizing by capillary electrophoresis. All samples were analyzed by 
      both methylation polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis. RESULTS: 
      FMR1 methylation status and CGG repeat sizing were accurately and reproducibly 
      determined in a set of methylation controls and genomic DNA samples representing 
      a spectrum of CGG repeat lengths and methylation states. Moreover, methylation 
      polymerase chain reaction revealed allele-specific methylation patterns in 
      premutation alleles that were unobtainable using Southern blot analysis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Methylation polymerase chain reaction enabled high throughput, high 
      resolution, and semiquantitative methylation assessments of FMR1 alleles, as well 
      as determinations of CGG repeat length. Results for all samples were concordant 
      with corresponding Southern blot analyses. As a result, this study presents a 
      polymerase chain reaction-based method for comprehensive FMR1 analysis. In 
      addition, the identification of novel methylation mosaic patterns revealed after 
      polymerase chain reaction and capillary electrophoresis may be relevant to 
      several FMR1 disorders.

PG  - 2161-70
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddr101 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative 
      disorder that affects carriers of premutation alleles (55-200 CGG repeats) of the 
      fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. The presence of elevated levels of 
      expanded mRNA found in premutation carriers is believed to be the basis for the 
      pathogenesis in FXTAS, but the exact mechanisms by which the mRNA causes toxicity 
      are not known. In particular, it is not clear whether there is a threshold for a 
      CGG-repeat number below which no cellular dysregulation occurs, or whether 
      toxicity depends on mRNA concentration. We have developed a doxycycline-inducible 
      episomal system that allows us to study separately the effects of CGG-repeat 
      number and mRNA concentration (at fixed CGG-repeat length) in 
      neuroblastoma-derived SK cells. Our findings show that there is a CGG-repeat size 
      threshold for toxicity that lies between 62 and 95 CGG repeats. Interestingly, 
      for repeat sizes of 95 CGG and above, there is a clear negative correlation 
      between mRNA concentration and cell viability. Taken together, our results 
      provide evidence for an RNA-toxicity model with primary dependence on CGG-repeat 
      size and secondary dependence on mRNA concentration, thus formally ruling out any 
      simple titration model that operates in the absence of either protein-binding 
      cooperativity or some form of length-dependent RNA structural transition.

      CGG repeat expansion and the hypermethylation status of its promoter. Methylated 
      alleles lead to transcriptional inhibition and consequent loss of Fragile X 
      Mental Retardation Protein. Chemical modification of cytosine to uracil by 
      bisulfite treatment has proved to be an attractive method for DNA methylation 
      studies that precludes labor-intensive Southern blot analysis, which is the gold 
      standard test for FXS. In this report, bisulfite-treated DNA samples were 
      amplified using real-time multiplex methylation-specific polymerase chain 
      reaction followed by melting curve analysis. Our results show that all control 
      samples with known CGG repeat numbers and methylation statuses were correctly 
      diagnosed. The samples from 43 male patients were also successfully diagnosed, 
      which were in complete agreement with the results of Southern blotting. By such 
      means, 39 patients were found to have an unmethylated allele; 3, a fully mutated 
      allele; and 1, both methylated and unmethylated alleles, thus implying a 
      diagnosis of mosaicism. In conclusion, we find our method to be convenient for 
      screening a large number of male patients with FXS, because it is rapid and easy 
      to perform, especially when there is a low quantity of DNA that must be 
      sensitively and accurately assayed.

TI  - Evidence for the toxicity of bidirectional transcripts and mitochondrial 
      dysfunction in blood associated with small CGG expansions in the FMR1 gene in 
      patients with parkinsonism.
PG  - 392-9
LID - 10.1097/GIM.0b013e3182064362 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Our previous results showed that both gray zone and lower end 
      premutation range (40-85 repeats) fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) alleles 
      were more common among males with parkinsonism than in the general population. 
      This study aimed to determine whether these alleles have a significant role in 
      the manifestations and pathogenesis of parkinsonian disorders. METHODS: Detailed 
      clinical assessment and genetic testing were performed in 14 male carriers of 
      premutation and gray zone FMR1 alleles and in 24 noncarriers identified in a 
      sample of males with parkinsonism. RESULTS: The premutation + gray zone carriers 
      presented with more severe symptoms than disease controls matched for age, 
      diagnosis, disease duration, and treatment. The Parkinson disease (Unified 
      Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) motor score and the measures of cognitive 
      decline (Mini-Mental State Examination and/or Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination 
      Final Revised Version A scores) were significantly correlated with the size of 
      the CGG repeat and the (elevated) levels of antisense FMR1 and Cytochrome C1 
      mRNAs in blood leukocytes. In addition, the carriers showed a significant 
      depletion of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced dehydrogenase subunit 
      1 mitochondrial gene in whole blood. CONCLUSION: Small CGG expansion FMR1 alleles 
      (gray zone and lower end premutation) play a significant role in the development 
      of the parkinsonian phenotype, possibly through the cytotoxic effect of elevated 
      sense and/or antisense FMR1 transcripts involving mitochondrial dysfunction and 
      leading to progressive neurodegeneration.

TI  - A nonsense mutation in FMR1 causing fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 489-91
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2010.223 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is a common cause of inherited intellectual disability. It is 
      caused by lack of the FMR1 gene product FMRP. The most frequent cause is the 
      expansion of a CGG repeat located in the 5'UTR of FMR1. Alleles with 200 or more 
      repeats become hypermethylated and transcriptionally silent. Only few patients 
      with intragenic point mutations in FMR1 have been reported and, currently, 
      routine analysis of patients referred for fragile X syndrome includes solely 
      analysis for repeat expansion and methylation status. We identified a 
      substitution in exon 2 of FMR1, c.80C>A, causing a nonsense mutation p.Ser27X, in 
      a patient with classical clinical symptoms of fragile X syndrome. The mother who 
      carried the mutation in heterozygous form presented with mild intellectual 
      impairment. We conclude that further studies including western blot and DNA 
      sequence analysis of the FMR1 gene should be performed in patients with typical 
      symptoms of fragile X syndrome in whom no CGG repeat expansion is detected.

TI  - Distribution of CGG/GCC repeats at the FMR1 and FMR2 genes in an Indian 
      population with mental retardation of unknown etiology.
PG  - 281-4
LID - 10.1089/gtmb.2010.0167 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Fragile X syndrome is one of the X-linked disorders associated with 
      moderate to severe mental retardation. Fragile X A syndrome (FRAXA) and fragile X 
      E syndrome (FRAXE) are caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion of CGG and GCC 
      repeats at the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 and FMR2 genes, respectively. 
      The present study was undertaken to identify the repeat polymorphism and to 
      estimate the risk of transmission in Andhra Pradesh and surrounding states of 
      South India. RESULTS: The FRAXA and FRAXE allelic polymorphisms were studied by 
      radioactive polymerase chain reaction that revealed 25 FRAXA among 344 
      X-chromosomes and 20 FRAXE allelic variants among 212 X-chromosomes in our 
      population. The most frequent FRAXA allele size was of 29 CGG repeats (27.5%) 
      followed by allele sizes of 28 (20.8%) and 31 (7.2%), and that of FRAXE was 15 
      GCC repeats (24.0%) followed by allele containing 18 repeats (18.4%) and 16 
      repeats (11.3%). CONCLUSIONS: CGG/GCC repeat polymorphism at the FMR1 and FMR2 
      loci observed in this study demonstrated a racial and ethnic variation among the 
      populations.

LID - e1001240
AB  - Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) is a common inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat in the 5'UTR of the 
      fragile X syndrome (FXS) gene, FMR1. The expanded CGG repeat is thought to induce 
      toxicity as RNA, and in FXTAS patients mRNA levels for FMR1 are markedly 
      increased. Despite the critical role of FMR1 mRNA in disease pathogenesis, the 
      basis for the increase in FMR1 mRNA expression is unknown. Here we show that 
      overexpressing any of three histone deacetylases (HDACs 3, 6, or 11) suppresses 
      CGG repeat-induced neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of FXTAS. This 
      suppression results from selective transcriptional repression of the CGG 
      repeat-containing transgene. These findings led us to evaluate the acetylation 
      state of histones at the human FMR1 locus. In patient-derived lymphoblasts and 
      fibroblasts, we determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation that there is 
      increased acetylation of histones at the FMR1 locus in pre-mutation carriers 
      compared to control or FXS derived cell lines. These epigenetic changes correlate 
      with elevated FMR1 mRNA expression in pre-mutation cell lines. Consistent with 
      this finding, histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors repress FMR1 mRNA 
      expression to control levels in pre-mutation carrier cell lines and extend 
      lifespan in CGG repeat-expressing Drosophila. These findings support a disease 
      model whereby the CGG repeat expansion in FXTAS promotes chromatin remodeling in 
      cis, which in turn increases expression of the toxic FMR1 mRNA. Moreover, these 
      results provide proof of principle that HAT inhibitors or HDAC activators might 
      be used to selectively repress transcription at the FMR1 locus.

TI  - Determinants of R-loop formation at convergent bidirectionally transcribed 
      trinucleotide repeats.
PG  - 1749-62
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkq935 [doi]
AB  - R-loops have been described at immunoglobulin class switch sequences, prokaryotic 
      and mitochondrial replication origins, and disease-associated (CAG)n and (GAA)n 
      trinucleotide repeats. The determinants of trinucleotide R-loop formation are 
      unclear. Trinucleotide repeat expansions cause diseases including DM1 (CTG)n, 
      SCA1 (CAG)n, FRAXA (CGG)n, FRAXE (CCG)n and FRDA (GAA)n. Bidirectional convergent 
      transcription across these disease repeats can occur. We find R-loops formed when 
      CTG or CGG and their complementary strands CAG or CCG were transcribed; GAA 
      transcription, but not TTC, yielded R-loops. R-loop formation was sensitive to 
      DNA supercoiling, repeat length, insensitive to repeat interruptions, and formed 
      by extension of RNA:DNA hybrids in the RNA polymerase. R-loops arose by 
      transcription in one direction followed by transcription in the opposite 
      direction, and during simultaneous convergent bidirectional transcription of the 
      same repeat forming double R-loop structures. Since each transcribed disease 
      repeat formed R-loops suggests they may have biological functions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset 
      neuropsychiatric degenerative disorder that occurs predominantly in male FMR1 
      premutation carriers. Recently, a broader FXTAS spectrum that, besides the core 
      features of tremor and gait ataxia, also includes neuropsychiatric symptoms and 
      neuropathy as further clinically relevant symptoms has been described among 
      females. Herein 2 fragile X syndrome families with a mother-daughter FXTAS 
      transmission are described in detail in order to shed more light on the female 
      FXTAS phenotype. METHODS: Molecular characterization included CGG repeat length, 
      X-chromosome inactivation pattern determination, as well as FMR1 mRNA and FMRP 
      levels quantification. Neuroradiologic examination was performed by 3-T MRI. 
      Neuropsychological assessment included global cognitive, attention, and executive 
      prefrontal functions, verbal fluencies, verbal memory, and visuospatial 
      perception. RESULTS: Molecular, neurologic, neuropsychiatric, psychological, 
      cognitive, and neuroradiologic features description of 2 fragile X syndrome 
      families with a mother-daughter FXTAS transmission in which dementia is present 
      in both mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is not yet clear to what extent FXTAS 
      shortens lifespan, our findings show that FXTAS progresses from mild tremor 
      and/or ataxia to disabling motor and cognitive impairment, compromising the 
      patients' quality of life. Furthermore, our results show that FXTAS in women can 
      also develop as a multisystem neurodegenerative disorder with central and 
      peripheral nervous system involvement, and both motor and mental disturbances.

TI  - Premutation CGG-repeat expansion of the Fmr1 gene impairs mouse neocortical 
      development.
PG  - 64-79
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddq432 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a premutation CGG-trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion (55-200 CGG repeats) within the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 
      gene. Although FXTAS generally affects premutation carriers over 50 years of age, 
      cognitive and psychological symptoms can appear in carriers during childhood, 
      suggesting that the FMR1 premutation affects brain function early in life. Recent 
      work with cultured hippocampal neurons from a premutation (Fmr1 CGG knock-in) 
      mouse model revealed impaired development of early postnatal neurons, consistent 
      with the developmental clinical involvement of premutation carriers. In the 
      current work, we show that the presence of premutation CGG-repeat expansions in 
      the mouse Fmr1 gene alters embryonic neocortical development. Specifically, 
      embryonic premutation mice display migration defects in the neocortex and altered 
      expression of neuronal lineage markers. The current data demonstrate that 
      premutation alleles of the Fmr1 gene are associated with defects in developmental 
      programs operating during prenatal stages of brain formation and provide further 
      evidence that the FMR1 premutation has a neurodevelopmental component.

      treatments.
PG  - 12
LID - 10.1186/2040-2392-1-12 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by an expanded CGG repeat (> 200 repeats) in 
      the 5' untranslated portion of the fragile mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1), 
      leading to deficiency or absence of the FMR1 protein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA 
      carrier protein that controls the translation of several other genes that 
      regulate synaptic development and plasticity. Autism occurs in approximately 30% 
      of FXS cases, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified 
      (PDD-NOS) occurs in an additional 30% of cases. Premutation repeat expansions (55 
      to 200 CGG repeats) may also give rise to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), 
      including both autism and PDD-NOS, through a different molecular mechanism that 
      involves a direct toxic effect of the expanded CGG repeat FMR1 mRNA. RNA toxicity 
      can also lead to aging effects including tremor, ataxia and cognitive decline, 
      termed fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), in premutation 
      carriers in late life. In studies of mice bearing premutation expansions, there 
      is evidence of early postnatal neuronal cell toxicity, presenting as reduced cell 
      longevity, decreased dendritic arborization and altered synaptic morphology. 
      There is also evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in premutation carriers. Many 
      of the problems with cellular dysregulation in both premutation and full mutation 
      neurons also parallel the cellular abnormalities that have been documented in 
      autism without fragile X mutations. Research regarding dysregulation of 
      neurotransmitter systems in FXS, including the metabotropic glutamate receptor 
      (mGluR)1/5 pathway and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)A pathways, have led to new 
      targeted treatments for FXS. Preliminary evidence suggests that these new 
      targeted treatments will also be beneficial in non-fragile X forms of autism.

      responses.
PG  - 560-5
LID - 10.1016/j.rbmo.2010.05.015 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. 
      It is caused by a CGG repeat expansion, which results in hypermethylation and 
      silencing of the FMR1 gene. The results from 213 FXS prenatal diagnoses performed 
      in the study centre were reviewed. Family history of FXS or undiagnosed mental 
      retardation (MR) were the reasons for referral and 64% of mothers were not aware 
      of their status so prenatal and mother tests were performed at the same time. 
      Among those women referred for family history of unknown MR, 17.6% were found to 
      be FXS carriers. The attitudes and perceptions of the syndrome of 52 FXS carriers 
      were also evaluated. Most of them had been diagnosed as carriers when the child 
      was already born and the most common feeling was sadness, followed by impotence 
      and guilt. The majority of them had received genetic counselling and they 
      considered it useful. Regarding reproductive options, prenatal diagnosis was 
      chosen by 40.5% of women. Prenatal diagnosis for FXS is a good reproductive 
      option and it should be carried out whenever family history of MR is present. A 
      high percentage of FXS carriers are detected following this approach.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited form of developmental delay, 
      is typically caused by CGG-repeat expansion in FMR1. However, little attention 
      has been paid to sequence variants in FMR1. Through the use of pooled-template 
      massively parallel sequencing, we identified 130 novel FMR1 sequence variants in 
      a population of 963 developmentally delayed males without CGG-repeat expansion 
      mutations. Among these, we identified a novel missense change, p.R138Q, which 
      alters a conserved residue in the nuclear localization signal of FMRP. We have 
      also identified three promoter mutations in this population, all of which 
      significantly reduce in vitro levels of FMR1 transcription. Additionally, we 
      identified 10 noncoding variants of possible functional significance in the 
      introns and 3'-untranslated region of FMR1, including two predicted splice site 
      mutations. These findings greatly expand the catalog of known FMR1 sequence 
      variants and suggest that FMR1 sequence variants may represent an important cause 
      of developmental delay.

LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2010.135 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. It is 
      caused by expansion of a trinucleotide (CGG)n repeat sequence in the 5' 
      untranslated region of the FMR1 gene, resulting in promoter hypermethylation and 
      suppression of FMR1 transcription. Additionally, pre-mutation alleles in carrier 
      males and females may result in Fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome and primary 
      ovarian insufficiency, respectively. Fragile X is one of the most commonly 
      requested molecular genetic tests worldwide. Quality assessment schemes have 
      identified a wide disparity in allele sizing between laboratories. It is 
      therefore important that clinical laboratories have access to characterized 
      reference materials (RMs) to aid accurate allele sizing and diagnosis. With this 
      in mind, a panel of genotyping RMs for Fragile X syndrome has been developed, 
      which should be stable over many years and available to all diagnostic 
      laboratories. Immortalized cell lines were produced by Epstein-Barr virus 
      transformation of lymphocytes from consenting patients. Genomic DNA was extracted 
      in bulk and RM aliquots were freeze-dried in glass ampoules. Twenty-one 
      laboratories from seventeen countries participated in a collaborative study to 
      assess their suitability. Participants evaluated the samples (blinded, in 
      triplicate) in their routine methods alongside in-house and commercial controls. 
      The panel of five genomic DNA samples was endorsed by the European Society of 
      Human Genetics and approved as an International Standard by the Expert Committee 
      on Biological Standardization at the World Health Organization.

TI  - FMR1 gene expansion and scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficits in 
      parkinsonism patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine if patients with parkinsonism and fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) gene expansions have a striatal dopamine deficit similar to 
      Parkinson disease (PD) patients. SCOPE: The authors studied three patients with 
      parkinsonism carrying small expansions in the FMR1 gene (41-60 CGG) with 
      [(123)I]beta-CIT SPECT imaging. The patients responded to dopaminergic medications, 
      but had preserved dopamine transporter density. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      suggest that parkinsonism associated with smaller FMR1 expansions may be related 
      to mechanisms other than pre-synaptic dopaminergic changes and may represent a 
      potential explanation for at least some parkinsonian cases with scans without 
      evidence of dopaminergic deficits (SWEDD).

TI  - An information-rich CGG repeat primed PCR that detects the full range of fragile 
      X expanded alleles and minimizes the need for southern blot analysis.
PG  - 589-600
LID - 10.2353/jmoldx.2010.090227 [doi]
AB  - (CGG)(n) repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene is associated with fragile X syndrome 
      and other disorders. Current methods for FMR1 molecular testing rely on Southern 
      blot analysis to detect expanded alleles too large to be PCR-amplified and to 
      identify female homozygous alleles that often confound interpretations of PCR 
      data. A novel, single-tube CGG repeat primed FMR1 PCR technology was designed 
      with two gene-specific primers that flank the triplet repeat region, as well as a 
      third primer that is complementary to the (CGG)(n) repeat. This PCR was evaluated 
      with 171 unique DNA samples, including a blinded set of 146 clinical specimens. 
      The method detected all alleles reported by Southern blot analysis, including 
      full mutations in 66 clinical samples and comprised up to 1300 CGG. Furthermore, 
      a blinded cohort of 42 female homozygous and heterozygous specimens, including 21 
      with full mutation alleles, was resolved with 100% accuracy. Last, AGG 
      interrupter sequences, which may influence the risk of (CGG)(n) expansion in the 
      children of some carriers, were each correctly identified in 14 male and female 
      clinical samples as referenced to DNA sequencing. As a result, this PCR provides 
      robust detection of expanded alleles and resolves allele zygosity, thus 
      minimizing the number of samples that require Southern blot analysis and 
      producing more comprehensive FMR1 genotyping data than other methods.

AB  - Population screening has been proposed for Fragile X syndrome to identify 
      premutation carrier females and affected newborns. We developed a PCR-based assay 
      capable of quickly detecting the presence or absence of an expanded FMR1 allele 
      with high sensitivity and specificity. This assay combines a triplet repeat 
      primed PCR with high-throughput automated capillary electrophoresis. We evaluated 
      assay performance using archived samples sent for Fragile X diagnostic testing 
      representing a range of Fragile X CGG-repeat expansions. Two hundred five 
      previously genotyped samples were tested with the new assay. Data were analyzed 
      for the presence of a trinucleotide "ladder" extending beyond 55 repeats, which 
      was set as a cut-off to identify expanded FMR1 alleles. We identified expanded 
      FMR1 alleles in 132 samples (59 premutation, 71 full mutation, 2 mosaics) and 
      normal FMR1 alleles in 73 samples. We found 100% concordance with previous 
      results from PCR and Southern blot analyses. In addition, we show feasibility of 
      using this assay with DNA extracted from dried-blood spots. Using a single PCR 
      combined with high-throughput fragment analysis on the automated capillary 
      electrophoresis instrument, we developed a rapid and reproducible PCR-based 
      laboratory assay that meets many of the requirements for a first-tier test for 
      population screening.

TI  - FMR1 gene expansion, large deletion of Xp, and skewed X-inactivation in a girl 
      with mental retardation and autism.
PG  - 1273-7
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.33352 [doi]
AB  - We describe a girl with mild facial anomalies, mild mental retardation, and 
      atypical autism with a remarkable behavioral phenotype of persistent anger, 
      aggression, and dysphoria. The occurrence of late-onset tremor and premature 
      ovarian failure in the maternal branch of the family pointed to a possible defect 
      in the FMR1 gene. Indeed, the patient carried a full FMR1 mutation. Unexpectedly, 
      both alleles of the gene were almost completely methylated. Cytogenetic 
      examination of the patient revealed in addition a large de novo deletion in band 
      Xp22 on one of her X chromosomes. The deletion was fine mapped using 
      oligonucleotide array CGH, and its breakpoints were localized using sequencing. 
      The size of the deletion was about 17.4 Mb, and it contained more than 90 
      protein-coding genes. Microsatellite analysis indicated paternal origin of the 
      aberrant chromosome. The large rearrangement was the most probable cause of the 
      X-inactivation skewing, thus explaining the methylation of not only the expanded 
      (maternal) but also the normal (paternal) FMR1 alleles. This pattern of skewed 
      X-inactivation was confirmed using the analysis of methylation at the AR locus. 
      The relatively mild phenotype of the patient resulted most likely from unmasking 
      of the FMR1 defect. Although the deleted region contained many important genes, 
      the phenotypic contribution of the rearranged X chromosome was probably limited 
      by its almost complete inactivation. However, reduced dose of several genes 
      escaping X-inactivation might also play a role in the phenotype of the patient.

TI  - Abnormal N400 word repetition effects in fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome.
PG  - 1438-50
LID - 10.1093/brain/awq077 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, a neurodegenerative disorder 
      associated with premutation alleles (55-200 CGG repeats) of the FMR1 gene, 
      affects many carriers in late-life. Patients with fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome typically have cerebellar ataxia, intranuclear inclusions 
      in neurons and astrocytes, as well as cognitive impairment. Dementia can also be 
      present with cognitive deficits that are as severe as in Alzheimer's disease, 
      however frontosubcortical type impairment is more pronounced in fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. We sought to characterize the P600 and N400 
      word repetition effects in patients with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome, using an event-related potential word repetition paradigm with 
      demonstrated sensitivity to very early Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized that 
      the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome-affected participants with poor 
      declarative verbal memory would have pronounced abnormalities in the P600 
      repetition effect. In the event-related potential experiment, subjects performed 
      a category decision task whilst an electroencephalogram was recorded. Auditory 
      category statements were each followed by an associated visual target word (50% 
      'congruous' category exemplars, 50% 'incongruous' nouns). Two-thirds of the 
      stimuli (category statement-target word pairs) were repeated, either at short-lag 
      (approximately 10-40 s) or long-lag (approximately 100-140 s). The N400 and P600 
      amplitude data were submitted to split-plot analyses of variance. These analyses 
      of variance showed a highly significant reduction of the N400 repetition effect 
      (F = 22.5, P < 0.001), but not of the P600 repetition effect, in mild fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (n = 32, mean age = 68.7, mean Mini-Mental 
      State Examination score = 26.8). Patients with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome had significantly smaller late positive amplitude (550-800 ms 
      post-stimulus onset) to congruous words (P = 0.04 for group effect). Reduced P600 
      repetition effect amplitude was associated with poorer recall within fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome patients (r = 0.66) and across all subjects 
      (r = 0.52). Larger P600 amplitude to new congruous words also correlated 
      significantly with higher free recall scores (r = 0.37, P < 0.01) across all 
      subjects. We found a correlation between the amplitude of late positivity and CGG 
      repeat length in those with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (r = 
      0.47, P = 0.006). Higher levels of FMR1 mRNA were associated with smaller N400s 
      to incongruous words and larger positive amplitudes (between 300 and 500 ms) to 
      congruous words. In conclusion, event-related potential word repetition effects 
      appear sensitive to the cognitive dysfunction present in patients with mild 
      fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. Their more severe reduction in N400 
      repetition effect, than P600, is in contrast to the reverse pattern reported in 
      amnestic mild cognitive impairment and incipient Alzheimer's disease (Olichney et 
      al., 2008).

AB  - Methylation of CpG sequences in and around CGG triplet repeats in FMR1 gene has 
      strong correlation with manifestation of the fragile X syndrome in human 
      patients. In contrast, we have observed a lack of correlation between repeat 
      instability and DNA methylation in three different transgenic mouse models 
      harboring unstable CGG repeats. Further we have demonstrated that the endogenous 
      copy of mouse Fmr1 gene remains unmethylated both in males and females. These 
      results imply that methylation and repeat instability are independent events and 
      raise the possibility that methylation could also result in repression of FMR1 
      transcription in the absence of repeat expansion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by loss of function mutations in 
      the FMR1 gene. Trinucleotide CGG-repeat expansions, resulting in FMR1 gene 
      silencing, are the most common mutations observed at this locus. Even though the 
      repeat expansion mutation is a functional null mutation, few conventional 
      mutations have been identified at this locus, largely due to the clinical 
      laboratory focus on the repeat tract. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To more 
      thoroughly evaluate the frequency of conventional mutations in FXS-like patients, 
      we used an array-based method to sequence FMR1 in 51 unrelated males exhibiting 
      several features characteristic of FXS but with normal CGG-repeat tracts of FMR1. 
      One patient was identified with a deletion in FMR1, but none of the patients were 
      found to have other conventional mutations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data 
      suggest that missense mutations in FMR1 are not a common cause of the FXS 
      phenotype in patients who have normal-length CGG-repeat tracts. However, 
      screening for small deletions of FMR1 may be of clinically utility.

AB  - Tandem repeat expansion is responsible for the Repeat Expansion Diseases, a group 
      of human genetic disorders that includes Fragile X syndrome (FXS). FXS results 
      from expansion of a premutation (PM) allele having 55-200 CGG.CCG-repeats in the 
      5' UTR of the FMR1 gene. The mechanism of expansion is unknown. We have treated 
      FX PM mice with potassium bromate (KBrO(3)), a potent DNA oxidizing agent. We 
      then monitored the germline and somatic expansion frequency in the progeny of 
      these animals. We show here that KBrO(3) increased both the level of 8-oxoG in 
      the oocytes of treated animals and the germline expansion frequency. Our data 
      thus suggest that oxidative damage may be a factor that could affect expansion 
      risk in humans.

TI  - Qualitative assessment of FMR1 (CGG)n triplet repeat status in normal, 
      intermediate, premutation, full mutation, and mosaic carriers in both sexes: 
      implications for fragile X syndrome carrier and newborn screening.
PG  - 162-73
LID - 10.1097/GIM.0b013e3181d0d40e [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Fragile X syndrome is caused by expansion and subsequent methylation of 
      a CGG trinucleotide repeat in the FMR1 5'-untranslated region. Southern blot 
      analysis is typically required to determine expansion size for triplet repeat 
      lengths >200. We describe a triplet-primed polymerase chain reaction-based method 
      using automated capillary electrophoresis detection for qualitative assessment of 
      expanded CGG repeats. METHODS: The assay uses triplet-primed polymerase chain 
      reaction in combination with GC-melting reagents and substitution of 
      7-deaza-2-deoxyGTP for dGTP. Amplicons are resolved by capillary electrophoresis. 
      RESULTS: A distinctive pattern of tapering or "stutter" polymerase chain reaction 
      amplification was evident on capillary electrophoresis in male and female 
      patients harboring all expanded allele lengths examined (up to 2000 CGG repeats) 
      and could be used to differentiate normal, intermediate, premutation, and full 
      mutation alleles. Full mutation alleles exhibited an additional late-migrating 
      amplicon on capillary electrophoresis. Mixing experiments demonstrated 
      sensitivity as low as 1% for detection of the full mutation allele. In a 
      1275-sample concordance study against our existing polymerase chain reaction 
      platform (with Southern blot analysis for repeat lengths >/=55), the triplet-primed 
      polymerase chain reaction method exhibited 100% concordance for normal, 
      intermediate, expanded, and full mutation alleles. This method also detected the 
      full mutation alleles in DNA isolated from blood spots. CONCLUSION: This assay 
      provides an accurate assessment of FMR1 repeat status and holds promise for use 
      in carrier and newborn screening. The method distinguishes normal homozygous 
      females from full mutation carrying females. Although the method is not useful 
      for accurate sizing, it supplements the classic polymerase chain reaction method 
      and results in significant reduction in the number of Southern blot analyses 
      required to be performed in the laboratory to accurately assess the FMR1 genotype 
      in all individuals.

PG  - 1618-32

AB  - The fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by silencing of the fragile X mental 
      retardation gene (FMR1) and the absence of its product, fragile X mental 
      retardation protein (FMRP), resulting from CpG island methylation associated with 
      large CGG repeat expansions (more than 200) termed full mutation (FM). We have 
      identified a number of novel epigenetic markers for FXS using matrix-assisted 
      laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), 
      naming the most informative fragile X-related epigenetic element 1 (FREE1) and 2 
      (FREE2). Methylation of both regions was correlated with that of the FMR1 CpG 
      island detected using Southern blot (FREE1 R = 0.97; P < 0.00001, n = 23 and 
      FREE2 R = 0.93; P < 0.00001, n = 23) and negatively correlated with lymphocyte 
      expression of FMRP (FREE1 R = -0.62; P = 0.01, n = 15 and FREE2 R = -0.55; P = 
      0.03, n = 15) in blood of partially methylated 'high functioning' FM males. In 
      blood of FM carrier females, methylation of both markers was inversely correlated 
      with the FMR1 activation ratio (FREE1 R = -0.93; P < 0.0001, n = 12 and FREE2 R = 
      -0.95; P < 0.0001, n = 9). In a sample set of 49 controls, 18 grey zone (GZ 40-54 
      repeats), 22 premutation (PM 55-170 repeats) and 22 (affected) FXS subjects, the 
      FREE1 methylation pattern was consistent between blood and chorionic villi as a 
      marker of methylated FM alleles and could be used to differentiate FXS males and 
      females from controls, as well as from carriers of GZ/PM alleles, but not between 
      GZ and PM alleles and controls. Considering its high-throughput and specificity 
      for pathogenic FM alleles, low cost and minimal DNA requirements, FREE MALDI-TOF 
      MS offers a unique tool in FXS diagnostics and newborn population screening.

      disease is the presence of ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions in neurons 
      and in astrocytes. Ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions have also been 
      found in the neurons of transgenic mice model carrying an expanded CGG((98)) 
      trinucleotide repeat of human origin but have not previously been described in 
      glial cells. Therefore, we used immunocytochemical methods to determine the 
      pathological features of nuclear and/or cytoplasmic inclusions in astrocytes, 
      Bergmann glia, and neurons, as well as relationships between inclusion patterns, 
      age, and repeat length in CGG knock-in (KI) mice in comparison with wild-type 
      mice. In CGG KI mice, ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions were found in 
      neurons (e.g., pyramidal cells, GABAergic neurons) throughout the brain in 
      cortical and subcortical brain regions; these inclusions increased in number and 
      size with advanced age. Ubiquitin-positive intranuclear inclusions were also 
      present in protoplasmic astrocytes, including Bergmann glia in the cerebellum. 
      The morphology of intranuclear inclusions in CGG KI mice was compared to that of 
      typical inclusions in human neurons and astrocytes in postmortem FXTAS brain 
      tissue. This new finding of previously unreported pathology in astrocytes of CGG 
      KI mice now provides an important mouse model to study astrocyte pathology in 
      human FXTAS.

AB  - The mental retardation, autistic features, and behavioral abnormalities 
      characteristic of the Fragile X mental retardation syndrome result from the loss 
      of function of the RNA-binding protein FMRP. The disease is usually caused by a 
      triplet repeat expansion in the 5'UTR of the FMR1 gene. This leads to loss of 
      function through transcriptional gene silencing, pointing to a key function for 
      FMRP, but precluding genetic identification of critical activities within the 
      protein. Moreover, antisense transcripts (FMR4, ASFMR1) in the same locus have 
      been reported to be silenced by the repeat expansion. Missense mutations offer 
      one means of confirming a central role for FMRP in the disease, but to date, only 
      a single such patient has been described. This patient harbors an isoleucine to 
      asparagine mutation (I304N) in the second FMRP KH-type RNA-binding domain, 
      however, this single case report was complicated because the patient harbored a 
      superimposed familial liver disease. To address these issues, we have generated a 
      new Fragile X Syndrome mouse model in which the endogenous Fmr1 gene harbors the 
      I304N mutation. These mice phenocopy the symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome in the 
      existing Fmr1-null mouse, as assessed by testicular size, behavioral phenotyping, 
      and electrophysiological assays of synaptic plasticity. I304N FMRP retains some 
      functions, but has specifically lost RNA binding and polyribosome association; 
      moreover, levels of the mutant protein are markedly reduced in the brain 
      specifically at a time when synapses are forming postnatally. These data suggest 
      that loss of FMRP function, particularly in KH2-mediated RNA binding and in 
      synaptic plasticity, play critical roles in pathogenesis of the Fragile X 
      Syndrome and establish a new model for studying the disorder.

AB  - Fragile X associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative 
      disorder that is the result of a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the range 
      of 55-200 in the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene. To better understand the progression of 
      this disorder, a knock-in (CGG KI) mouse was developed by substituting the mouse 
      CGG8 trinucleotide repeat with an expanded CGG98 repeat from human origin. It has 
      been shown that this mouse shows deficits on the water maze at 52 weeks of age. 
      In the present study, this CGG KI mouse model of FXTAS was tested on behavioral 
      tasks that emphasize spatial information processing. The results demonstrate that 
      at 12 and 24 weeks of age, CGG KI mice were unable to detect a change in the 
      distance between two objects (metric task), but showed intact detection of a 
      transposition of the objects (topological task). At 48 weeks of age, CGG KI mice 
      were unable to detect either change in object location. These data indicate that 
      hippocampal-dependent impairments in spatial processing may occur prior to 
      parietal cortex-dependent impairments in FXTAS.

PG  - 66-8
LID - 10.1038/jhg.2009.121 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X-associated disorders are caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      in the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. Expansion of the CGG 
      trinucleotide repeats to >200 copies (that is, a full mutation) induces 
      methylation of the FMR1 gene, with transcriptional silencing being the eventual 
      outcome. Previous data have shown that FMR1 premutation carriers (individuals 
      with 55-199 repeats) have increased FMR1 mRNA levels with decreased protein 
      (fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)) levels. However, the point at which 
      this translational inefficiency occurs, given the increased transcription 
      mechanism, has not yet been explored and remains to be elucidated. We examined 
      the repeat length group, FMR1 transcript and FMRP levels in 74 males with a wide 
      range of repeat lengths using analysis of covariance to better characterize this 
      association. Results showed that the mean FMRP level among carriers with 80-89 
      repeats was significantly higher than the mean levels among lower (54-79) and 
      higher (90-120) premutation carriers, in spite of the increasing transcript level 
      with repeat length. Taken together, these results suggest that the 80-89-repeat 
      group may lead to different properties that increase the efficiency of 
      translation compared with other premutation repeat size groups.

AB  - Premutation CGG repeat expansions (55-200 CGG repeats; preCGG) within the fragile 
      X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene give rise to the neurodegenerative disorder, 
      fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), primary ovarian 
      insufficiency and neurodevelopmental problems. Morphometric analysis of Map2B 
      immunofluorescence reveals that neurons cultured from heterozygous female mice 
      with preCGG repeats in defined medium display shorter dendritic lengths and fewer 
      branches between 7 and 21 days in vitro compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. 
      Although the numbers of synapsin and phalloidin puncta do not differ from WT, 
      preCGG neurons possess larger puncta. PreCGG neurons display lower viability, and 
      express elevated stress protein as they mature. PreCGG neurons have inherently 
      different patterns of growth, dendritic complexity and synaptic architecture 
      discernable early in the neuronal trajectory to maturation, and may reflect a 
      cellular basis for the developmental component of the spectrum of clinical 
      involvement in carriers of premutation alleles. The reduced viability of preCGG 
      neurons is consistent with the mRNA toxicity and neurodegeneration associated 
      with FXTAS.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from a CGG-repeat expansion that triggers 
      hypermethylation and silencing of the FMR1 gene. FXS is referred to as the most 
      common form of inherited intellectual disability, yet its true incidence has 
      never been measured directly by large population screening. Here, we developed an 
      inexpensive and high-throughput assay to quantitatively assess FMR1 methylation 
      in DNA isolated from the dried blood spots of 36,124 deidentified newborn males. 
      This assay displays 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity for detecting FMR1 
      methylation, successfully distinguishing normal males from males with 
      full-mutation FXS. Furthermore, the assay can detect excess FMR1 methylation in 
      82% of females with full mutations, although the methylation did not correlate 
      with intellectual disability. With amelogenin PCR used for detecting the presence 
      of a Y chromosome, this assay can also detect males with Klinefelter syndrome 
      (KS) (47, XXY). We identified 64 males with FMR1 methylation and, after 
      confirmatory testing, found seven to have full-mutation FXS and 57 to have KS. 
      Because the precise incidence of KS is known, we used our observed KS incidence 
      as a sentinel to assess ascertainment quality and showed that our KS incidence of 
      1 in 633 newborn males was not significantly different from the literature 
      incidence of 1 in 576 (p = 0.79). The seven FXS males revealed an FXS incidence 
      in males of 1 in 5161 (95% confidence interval of 1 in 10,653-1 in 2500), 
      consistent with some earlier indirect estimates. Given the trials now underway 
      for possible FXS treatments, this method could be used in newborn or infant 
      screening as a way of ensuring early interventions for FXS.

TI  - Small CGG repeat expansion alleles of FMR1 gene are associated with parkinsonism.
PG  - 471-6

AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) affects older males carrying 
      premutation, that is, expansions of the CGG repeat (in the 55-200 range), in the 
      FMR1 gene. The neurological changes are linked to the excessive FMR1 messenger 
      RNA (mRNA), becoming toxic through a 'gain-of-function'. Because elevated levels 
      of this mRNA are also found in carriers of the smaller expansion (grey zone) 
      alleles, ranging from 40 to 54 CGGs, we tested for a possible role of these 
      alleles in the origin of movement disorders associated with tremor. We screened 
      228 Australian males affected with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and other 
      causes of parkinsonism recruited from Victoria and Tasmania for premutation and 
      grey zone alleles. The frequencies of either of these alleles were compared with 
      the frequencies in a population-based sample of 578 Guthrie spots from 
      consecutive Tasmanian male newborns (controls). There was a significant excess of 
      premutation carriers (Fisher's exact test p = 0.006). There was also a more than 
      twofold increase in grey zone carriers in the combined sample of the Victorian 
      and Tasmanian cases, with odds ratio (OR ) = 2.36, and 95% confidence intervals 
      (CI): 1.20-4.63, as well as in Tasmanian cases only (OR = 2.33, 95% CI: 
      1.06-5.13), compared with controls. The results suggest that the FMR1 grey zone 
      alleles, as well as premutation alleles, might contribute to the aetiology of 
      disorders associated with parkinsonism.

TI  - Relevance of triple CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene to ovarian reserve.
PG  - 385-90
AB  - Most individuals demonstrate 29-30 CGG triple repeats on the FMR1 gene. This may 
      functionally represent a normal range in regard to ovarian reserve. Higher counts 
      reflect risk towards premature ovarian senescence, but lower counts have not been 
      investigated before and, therefore, were the principal subject of this 
      investigation. Amongst 316 consecutive infertility patients, 94 demonstrated <28 
      repeats (group A), 163 28-33 repeats (group B, considered normal repeat numbers) 
      and 59 > or =34 repeats (group C). The three groups did not differ in age, FSH or 
      anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) concentrations. Neither FSH nor AMH correlated in 
      linear regression with <28 CGG repeats. In logistic regression, AMH of < or =0.8 
      ng/ml (indicative of diminished ovarian reserve at all ages) was, however, 
      significantly associated with number of repeats (P < 0.001). Every decrease by 
      five CGG repeats in group A increased the likelihood of diminished ovarian 
      reserve by 40%, while every increase by five CGG repeats in group C increased 
      risk by 50% (both P < 0.002). AMH of < or =0.8 ng/ml statistically correlated 
      overall with decreasing triple CGG repeats throughout all ranges (P < 0.001). 
      Approximately 29-30 CGG repeats appear reflective of normal ovarian reserve, with 
      higher and lower counts denoting similar risks towards premature ovarian 
      senescence.

TI  - ATM and ATR protect the genome against two different types of tandem repeat 
      instability in Fragile X premutation mice.
PG  - 6371-7
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkp666 [doi]
AB  - Expansion of a tandem repeat tract is responsible for the Repeat Expansion 
      diseases, a group of more than 20 human genetic disorders that includes those 
      like Fragile X (FX) syndrome that result from repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene. 
      We have previously shown that the ATM and Rad3-related (ATR) checkpoint kinase 
      protects the genome against one type of repeat expansion in a FX premutation 
      mouse model. By crossing the FX premutation mice to Ataxia Telangiectasia-Mutated 
      (Atm) mutant mice, we show here that ATM also prevents repeat expansion. However, 
      our data suggest that the ATM-sensitive mechanism is different from the 
      ATR-sensitive one. Specifically, the effect of the ATM deficiency is more marked 
      when the premutation allele is paternally transmitted and expansions occur more 
      frequently in male offspring regardless of the Atm genotype of the offspring. The 
      gender effect is most consistent with a repair event occurring in the early 
      embryo that is more efficient in females, perhaps as a result of the action of an 
      X-linked DNA repair gene. Our data thus support the hypothesis that two different 
      mechanisms of FX repeat expansion exist, an ATR-sensitive mechanism seen on 
      maternal transmission and an ATM-sensitive mechanism that shows a male expansion 
      bias.

TI  - Longer CAG repeat length in the androgen receptor gene is associated with 
      premature ovarian failure.
PG  - 3230-5
LID - 10.1093/humrep/dep296 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a disorder characterized by lack 
      of ovulation and elevated serum gonadotrophin levels before the age of 40 years. 
      The cause of POF in most cases is unknown. As mice lacking the Androgen receptor 
      (Ar) gene reportedly have a POF-like phenotype, we hypothesize that, variations 
      in the AR gene maybe one of the causative factors for POF in humans. Thus the 
      objective of the study is to evaluate the number of CAG repeats in exon 1 of the 
      AR gene in non-familial, non-syndromic cases of POF. METHODS: A clinic-based 
      case-control study. Seventy-eight patients with non-familial, non-syndromic POF, 
      and 90 controls were recruited to investigate the CAG repeat numbers in exon 1 of 
      the AR gene by PCR and Gene Scan analysis. RESULTS: The mean CAG repeat length in 
      exon 1 of the AR gene of women with POF was 23.6 +/- 3.8, which was significantly 
      higher than controls (20.08 +/- 3.45) (P < 0.001). The biallelic mean CAG repeat 
      ranged from 11 to 32 in the control women, compared to 16 to 30 in the POF 
      patients. The 22 CAG repeat allele followed by the 24 CAG repeat allele was found 
      to be at highest frequency (15.38 and 12.8%) in POF cases, although the 19 CAG 
      repeat allele was observed at highest frequency (12.2%) in controls. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The observation suggests that the CAG repeat length is increased in women with 
      POF as compared with controls, and may be pathogenic for POF, at least in a 
      subset of Indian women.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome and other trinucleotide diseases are characterized by an 
      elongation of a repeating DNA triplet. The ensemble-averaged lambda exonuclease 
      digestion rate of different substrates, including one with an elongated FMR1 gene 
      containing 120 CGG repeats, was measured using absorption and fluorescence 
      spectroscopy. By use of magnetic tweezers sequence-dependent digestion rates and 
      pausing was measured for individual lambda exonucleases. Within the triplet 
      repeats a lower average and narrower distribution of rates and a higher frequency 
      of pausing was observed.

TI  - Expansion of an FMR1 grey-zone allele to a full mutation in two generations.
PG  - 306-10
LID - 10.2353/jmoldx.2009.080174 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X Syndrome is caused by the expansion of an unstable CGG-repeat tract in 
      the 5'-UTR of the FMR1 gene, which generally results in transcriptional silencing 
      and consequent absence of the FMR1 protein. To date, the smallest premutation 
      allele reported to expand to a full mutation allele in a single generation is 59 
      CGG repeats. Here, we report a single-generation expansion to a full mutation 
      allele (male with approximately 538 CCG repeats) from a mother who is a carrier 
      of a premutation allele of 56 CGG repeats. Furthermore, the maternal grandfather 
      was a carrier of a gray (or intermediate)-zone allele (45 to 54 repeats) of 52 
      CGG repeats. Thus, in this family, a gray-zone allele expanded to the full 
      mutation range in two generations. Interestingly, the two AGG interruptions 
      present in the grandfather's allele were absent in the mother's premutation 
      allele. These observations underscore the need to consider carriers of alleles of 
      greater than 55 CGG repeats as being at risk for transmission of a full mutation 
      allele in a single generation, and those with even smaller alleles in the gray 
      zone as being at risk of having grandchildren with full mutation alleles.

PG  - 5533-40
LID - 10.1021/ac9008918 [doi]
AB  - CGG repeat expansions in the 5' noncoding region of the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 gene (FMR1) give rise to both neurodevelopmental and 
      neurodegenerative human diseases depending on the length of the expansion. 
      Expansions beyond 200 repeats (full mutation) generally result in gene silencing 
      and fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading heritable form of cognitive impairment 
      and autism. Smaller expansions (55-200 CGG repeats; "premutation") give rise to 
      the neurodegenerative disorder fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS) through an entirely distinct, toxic mRNA gain-of-function mechanism. A 
      rapid means for both high-risk and newborn screening for allele size would 
      provide a greater opportunity for early intervention and family counseling as 
      well as furnish critical data on repeat size distribution and expanded allele 
      frequencies. In the current work, we propose a novel mass spectrometry (MS) based 
      method for the rapid identification of expanded CGG repeats to complement a 
      recently described polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for large population 
      screening. In this combined approach, the optimized PCR method is used to amplify 
      the relevant region of FMR1, followed by extensive nonspecific nuclease 
      digestion. The resulting oligonucleotides are analyzed by MS in a manner that 
      provides the relative proportion of triplet repeat oligonucleotides in seconds 
      per sample. This assay enables swift and reproducible detection of expanded CGG 
      alleles using a single blood spot and in principle is suitable for large scale 
      studies and newborn screening. Moreover, this analytical scheme establishes a 
      unique new intersection of MS with molecular biology, with potential for 
      significant interdisciplinary impact.

AB  - Non-coding (CGG-repeat) expansions in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) 
      gene result in a spectrum of disorders involving altered neurodevelopment 
      (fragile X syndrome), neurodegeneration (late-onset fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome), or primary ovarian insufficiency. While reliable and 
      quantitative assays for the number of CGG repeats and FMR1 mRNA levels are now 
      available, there has been no scalable, quantitative assay for the FMR1 protein 
      (FMRP) in non-transformed cells. Using a combination of avian and murine 
      antibodies to FMRP, we developed a sensitive and highly specific sandwich 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for FMRP in peripheral blood 
      lymphocytes. This ELISA method is capable of quantifying FMRP levels throughout 
      the biologically relevant range of protein concentrations and is specific for the 
      intact FMRP protein. Moreover, the ELISA is well-suited for replicate protein 
      determinations across serial dilutions in non-transformed cells and is readily 
      scalable for large sample numbers. The FMRP ELISA is potentially a powerful tool 
      in expanding our understanding of the relationship between FMRP levels and the 
      various FMR1-associated clinical phenotypes.

TI  - Analysis of the Fragile X Trinucleotide Repeat in Basques: Association of 
      Premutation and Intermediate Sizes, Anchoring AGGs and Linked Microsatellites 
      with Unstable Alleles.
PG  - 191-9
LID - 10.2174/138920208784340722 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is associated with an unstable CGG repeat sequence in 
      the 5' untranslated region in the first exon of the FMR1 gene which resides at 
      chromosome position Xq27.3 and is coincident with the fragile site FRAXA. The CGG 
      sequence is polymorphic with respect to size and purity of the repeat. 
      Interpopulation variation in the polymorphism of the FMR1 gene and consequently, 
      in the predisposition to FXS due to the prevalence of certain unstable alleles 
      has been observed. Spanish Basque population is distributed among narrow valleys 
      in northeastern Spain with little migration between them until recently. This 
      characteristic may have had an effect on allelic frequency distributions. We had 
      previously reported preliminary data on the existence of FMR1 allele differences 
      between two Basque valleys (Markina and Arratia). In the present work we extended 
      the study to Uribe, Gernika, Durango, Goierri and Larraun, another five isolated 
      valleys enclosing the whole area within the Spanish Basque region. We analyzed 
      the prevalence of FMR1 premutated and intermediate/grey zone alleles. With the 
      aim to complete the previous investigation about the stability of the Fragile X 
      CGG repeat in Basque valleys, we also analyzed the existence of potentially 
      unstable alleles, not only in relation with size and purity of CGG repeat but 
      also in relation with DXS548 and FRAXAC1 haplotypes implicated in repeat 
      instability. The data show that differences in allele frequencies as well as in 
      the distribution of the mutational pathways previously identified are present 
      among Basques. The data also suggest that compared with the analyzed Basque 
      valleys, Gernika had increased frequency of susceptibility to instability 
      alleles, although the prevalence of premutation and intermediate/grey zone 
      alleles in all the analyzed valleys was lower than that reported in Caucasian 
      populations.

TI  - Functional status of men with the fragile X premutation, with and without the 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).
PG  - 1101-9

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), which occurs in 
      some premutation carriers of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene, is a 
      neurodegenerative disorder characterized by action tremor, gait ataxia, and 
      impaired executive cognitive functioning. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the nature and 
      severity of functional limitations among male carriers of the fragile X 
      premutation, both with and without FXTAS. METHODS: Forty-two subjects with FXTAS 
      and 24 asymptomatic premutation carriers were compared to 32 control subjects on 
      measures of physical functioning, activities of daily living (ADLs; e.g. eating, 
      bathing), and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs; e.g. shopping, 
      managing medications). Ordinary least squares regression, controlling for age, 
      education, medical comorbidity, and pain, was used to examine group differences 
      in physical and functional performance. RESULTS: Men with FXTAS performed 
      significantly worse than control subjects on all dependent measures, showing 
      greater limitations in physical functioning, as well as ADL and IADL performance 
      (p < 0.05). Subsequent analyses suggested that physical and functional 
      impairments among men with FXTAS result largely from deficits in motor and 
      executive functioning and that CGG repeat length is associated with functional 
      impairment. Asymptomatic carriers of the fragile X premutation performed 
      similarly to control subjects on all measures. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides 
      the first comprehensive evaluation of functional status among male premutation 
      carriers. Although carriers without FXTAS performed similarly to control 
      subjects, men with FXTAS showed evidence of significant physical and functional 
      impairment, which appears to result largely from motor and executive deficits 
      characteristic of the syndrome.

TI  - Screening for the presence of FMR1 premutation alleles in women with 
      parkinsonism.
PG  - 244-9
LID - 10.1001/archneurol.2008.548 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a progressive, 
      late-onset neurodegenerative disease that affects older carriers of premutation 
      (CGG) repeat expansions of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. 
      Clinical features include intention tremor, gait ataxia, memory loss, peripheral 
      neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, and parkinsonism. The presence of parkinsonism 
      in FXTAS raises the possibility that some individuals who have Parkinson disease 
      are actually carriers of a premutation FMR1 allele. OBJECTIVE: To screen DNA 
      samples from a large cohort of females with Parkinson disease for an excess of 
      expanded alleles of the FMR1 gene. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: We screened a cohort of 
      595 women with parkinsonism, the largest screening of a parkinsonism-associated 
      group to date, for the presence of an FMR1 premutation allele (55-200 CGG 
      repeats). The screening protocol uses an enhanced polymerase chain reaction 
      method capable of flagging any FMR1 expanded CGG repeat in women as well as in 
      men. SETTING: Diagnostic assessments were performed at an outpatient tertiary 
      clinic (Parkinson Institute, Milan). Genotyping was conducted at the University 
      of California, Davis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CGG repeat number and 
      clinical/neuroimaging assessments of patients with Parkinson disease were 
      conducted. Two premutation carriers were identified. RESULTS: Two individuals 
      possessed an FMR1 allele in the premutation range (CGG repeats: 30 and 75; 30 and 
      115). This carrier frequency (2 of 595 [0.34%]) is not significantly different 
      from estimates of the allele frequency among women in the general population 
      (0.4%-0.8%). Clinical and radiologic features of these 2 patients were similar to 
      those of the general Parkinson disease population; however, 1 patient (115 CGG 
      repeats) had a family history of 2 sons with the fragile X syndrome. CONCLUSION: 
      Screening of women within the parkinsonism clinical spectrum is unlikely to be 
      productive in the absence of additional medical or family history suggestive of 
      involvement of the FMR1 gene.

TI  - Preimplantation genetic diagnosis for fragile X syndrome: is there increased 
      transmission of abnormal FMR1 alleles among female heterozygotes?
PG  - 57-61
LID - 10.1002/pd.2179 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome is caused by a CGG triplet-repeat expansion 
      mutation in the FMR1 gene. Previous studies have shown increased transmission of 
      abnormal alleles in the 51-60 repeat range. This study was undertaken to evaluate 
      the performance of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for fragile X, and to 
      assess the transmission rate of the abnormal FMR1 alleles in this setting. 
      METHOD: The study included 18 fragile X carriers who applied for PGD. FMR1 CGG 
      repeats ranged from 70 to 300. PGD was performed using multiplex-nested PCR, with 
      simultaneous amplification of the CGG repeat region and several polymorphic 
      markers, and sex chromosome markers. RESULTS: Four patients had a poor ovarian 
      response, and could not undergo PGD. The remaining 14 patients underwent 47 PGD 
      cycles. A total of 565 oocytes were aspirated. Of the 386 embryos that were 
      successfully biopsied, 18 (6.4%) could not be analyzed due to amplification 
      failure, and 12 (4.3%) had sex chromosomal abnormalities. Of the remaining 250 
      embryos, the abnormal allele was transmitted to 124 embryos (49.6%) compared to 
      126 (50.4%) for the normal allele. This difference was not statistically 
      significant. Only embryos carrying the normal allele were transferred, resulting 
      in 7 clinical pregnancies (18% per embryo transfer). CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      demonstrate that PGD for fragile X is feasible, and that carriers transmit the 
      abnormal allele at the same frequency as the normal allele.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome is caused by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion of the FMR1 
      gene. Individuals with fragile X display several behavioral abnormalities 
      including hyperactivity, social anxiety, autistic-like features, impaired 
      cognitive processing, and impaired sensorimotor gating. The Fmr1KO mouse model of 
      fragile X exhibits several related behavioral phenotypes such as increased 
      activity and altered social interactions. Individuals with fragile X also have 
      impaired sensorimotor gating as measured using the prepulse inhibition of startle 
      response. The authors have recently shown that Fmr1KO mice with a yeast 
      artificial chromosome containing the human FMR1 gene have corrected or 
      overcorrected abnormal behaviors including hyperactivity and altered social 
      interactions. Here the authors present results from a study examining abnormal 
      sensorimotor gating in Fmr1KO mice. Consistent with previous findings, Fmr1KO 
      mice have increased prepulse inhibition. The KO mice with the yeast artificial 
      chromosome containing the human FMR1 gene had levels of prepulse inhibition 
      comparable to WT mice, indicating not only a correction of this phenotype, but 
      also clearly demonstrating that in mice levels of the fragile X mental 
      retardation protein regulate sensorimotor gating.

AB  - The 5' untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation gene, FMR1, 
      contains a polymorphic CGG repeat. Expansions of this repeat are associated with 
      a spectrum of disorders. Full mutation alleles, repeats >or= 200, are associated 
      with fragile X syndrome. Premutation alleles, repeats of approximately 55-199, 
      are associated with a tremor-ataxia syndrome most commonly in older males and 
      primary ovarian insufficiency in females. However, the neuropsychological impact 
      of carrying a premutation allele is presently unclear in younger adults. In this 
      study, we analyzed neuropsychological scores for 138 males and 506 females 
      ascertained from the general population and from families with a history of 
      fragile X syndrome. Subjects were age 18-50 years and had varying repeat lengths. 
      Neuropsychological scores were obtained from measures of general intelligence, 
      memory, and executive functioning, including attention. Principal component 
      analysis followed by varimax rotation was used to create independent factors for 
      analysis. These factors were modeled for males and females separately via a 
      general linear model that accounted for correlation among related subjects. All 
      models were adjusted for potential confounders, including age at testing, 
      ethnicity, and household income. Among males, no repeat length associations were 
      detected for any factor. Among females, only a significant association with 
      repeat length and self-report attention (p < 0.01) was detected, with premutation 
      carriers self-reporting significantly more attention-related problems compared to 
      noncarriers. No significant interactions between repeat length and age were 
      detected. Overall, these results indicate the lack of a global neuropsychological 
      impact of carrying a premutation allele among adults under the age of 50.

AB  - The 5'untranslated region (UTR) of the FMR1 gene contains a CGG-repeat, which may 
      become unstable upon transmission to the next generation. When repeat length 
      exceeds 200, the FMR1 gene generally undergoes methylation-mediated 
      transcriptional silencing. The subsequent absence of the gene product Fragile X 
      Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP)causes the mental retardation seen in fragile X 
      patients. A CGG-repeat length between 55 and 200 trinucleotides has been termed 
      the premutation (PM). Predominantly elderly male PM carriers are at risk of 
      developing a progressive neurodegenerative disorder: fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). All PM carriers have elevated FMR1 mRNA levels, 
      in spite of slightly decreased FMRP levels. The presence of intranuclear 
      ubiquitin-positive inclusions in many brain regions is a neuropathological 
      hallmark of FXTAS. Studies in humans attempting to correlate neuropathological 
      outcomes with molecular measures are difficult because of the limited 
      availability of tissue. Therefore, we have used the expanded CGG-repeat knock-in 
      mouse model of FXTAS to examine the relationship between the molecular and 
      neuropathological parameters in brain. We present Fmr1 mRNA and Fmrp levels and 
      the presence of intranuclear inclusions at different repeat lengths. Contrary to 
      existing hypotheses, our results suggest that inclusion formation may not depend 
      on the elevation per se of Fmr1 transcript levels in aged CGG mice.

AB  - Premutation carriers of repeat expansions in the fragile X mental retardation 
      (FMR1) gene develop kinetic tremor and ataxia or the 'fragile X associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome' (FXTAS). Affected FMR1 premutation carriers also have 
      parkinsonism, but have not been reported to meet criteria for Parkinson disease. 
      This case series illustrates that some patients who are FMR1 premutation carriers 
      may appear by history and examination to have idiopathic Parkinson disease. Based 
      on previous studies, it is likely that the genetic mutation and parkinsonism are 
      associated. Although screening all PD patients is likely to be low yield, genetic 
      testing of FMR1 in individuals with PD and a family history of fragile X 
      syndrome, autism or developmental delay, or other related FMR1 phenotypes is 
      warranted.

TI  - Risk of cognitive impairment in female premutation carriers of fragile X 
      premutation: analysis by means of robust segmented linear regression models.
PG  - 262-70
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.30803 [doi]
AB  - This report describes a study focused on the relationship between CGG repeat 
      length, FMRP, mRNA levels and cognitive functioning in premutation carriers (PM) 
      carriers of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). We studied 60 females-43 with PM and 17 
      with normal (N) alleles-from 25 FXS Spanish families. The Wechsler scales were 
      administered to all subjects and new blood samples and hair roots were taken to 
      study mRNA and FMRP levels. Using lowess curves together with segmented models we 
      showed that within the premutation range, IQ scores tend to decrease when the 
      number of CGG repeats increases and the FMRP values decrease. Furthermore, we 
      discovered cut-off points in the molecular variables that seem to change the 
      probability of having some cognitive impairment. Specifically, for those PM 
      females in the upper premutation range (CGG > or = 100) and with FMRP expression 
      < 60% in hair roots, a 10% decrement of FMRP expression represents a significant 
      decrease in IQ scores of about six points, which is more evident for Full-Scale 
      IQ (P-value = 0.035) and Performance IQ (P-value = 0.045) than for Verbal IQ 
      (P-value = 0.074). On the contrary, we did not find any significant correlation 
      between FMR1 mRNA levels and the IQ scores, probably due to the fact that mRNA 
      levels were measured in blood. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the PM 
      can have some effect on cognitive ability in female carriers, although these 
      effects may be subtle. In these cases, it would be advisable to carry out a hair 
      root analysis of FMRP.

TI  - Mood and anxiety disorders in females with the FMR1 premutation.
PG  - 130-9

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a model for studying the relative contributions of 
      genetic and environmental factors to psychiatric disorders in mothers of children 
      with disabilities. Here, we examine the frequency and predictors of mood and 
      anxiety disorders in mothers with the FMR1 premutation. Ninety-three females with 
      the FMR1 premutation were in the study and were compared to 2,159 women from the 
      National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) dataset. Mood and anxiety 
      disorders were assessed using the SCID-I. Our data reflect elevated lifetime 
      major depressive disorder (MDD), lifetime panic disorder without agoraphobia and 
      current agoraphobia without panic disorder in the FMR1 premutation sample. Also, 
      we found a low frequency of lifetime social phobia, specific phobia, and 
      post-traumatic stress disorders and current specific phobia in the FMR1 
      premutation sample. The profile of MDD in the FMR1 premutation sample was not 
      episodic or comorbid with an anxiety disorder, as in the NCS-R dataset. Never 
      having been married and smaller CGG repeat length were associated with increased 
      likelihood of MDD while increased children with FXS in the family and greater 
      child problem behaviors were associated with increased likelihood of an anxiety 
      disorder in the FMR 1 premutation group. Major depression in females with the 
      FMR1 premutation may not be characterized as an episodically chronic recurrent 
      disorder as it is in community samples and may have a genetic basis given the 
      relationship with CGG repeat length and lack of association with all child and 
      most demographic factors.

PG  - 493-502
LID - 10.1007/s10519-008-9214-3 [doi]
AB  - The fragile X disorder spectrum, due to a CGG expansion in FMR1, includes fragile 
      X syndrome (>200 repeats) and the premutation-associated disorders of ovarian 
      insufficiency and tremor/ataxia syndrome (approximately 55-199 repeats). Altered 
      neurobehavioral profiles including variation of phenotypes associated with mood 
      and anxiety may be expected among younger premutation carriers given this 
      spectrum of disorders. However, previous studies have produced conflicting 
      findings, providing the motivation to examine these phenotypes further. We 
      investigated measures of mood and anxiety in 119 males and 446 females age 18-50 
      ascertained from families with a history of fragile X syndrome and from the 
      general population. Scores were analyzed using a linear model with repeat length 
      as the main predictor, adjusting for potential confounders. Repeat length was not 
      associated with anxiety, but was marginally associated with depression and 
      negative affect in males and negative affect only in females. These results 
      suggest that premutation carriers may be at risk for emotional morbidity; 
      however, phenotypic differences were subtle and of small effect size.

TI  - Altered hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland axis regulation in the expanded 
      CGG-repeat mouse model for fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome.
PG  - 863-73
LID - 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2008.03.011 [doi]
AB  - The human FMR1 gene contains an unstable CGG-repeat in its 5' untranslated 
      region. The repeat length in the normal population is polymorphic (5-54 
      CGG-repeats). Individuals carrying lengths beyond 200 CGGs (i.e. the full 
      mutation) show hypermethylation and as a consequence gene silencing of the FMR1 
      gene. The absence of the gene product FMRP causes the fragile X syndrome, the 
      most common inherited form of mental retardation. Elderly carriers of the 
      premutation (PM), which is defined as a repeat length between 55 and 200 CGGs, 
      can develop a progressive neurodegenerative syndrome: fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). The high FMR1 mRNA levels observed in cells from 
      PM carriers have led to the hypothesis that FXTAS is caused by a pathogenic RNA 
      gain-of-function mechanism. Apart from tremor/ataxia, specific psychiatric 
      symptoms have been described in PM carriers with or without FXTAS. Since these 
      symptoms could arise from elevated stress hormone levels, we investigated 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation using a knock-in mouse model 
      with an expanded CGG-repeat in the PM range (>98 repeats) in the Fmr1 gene, which 
      shows repeat instability, and displays biochemical, phenotypic and 
      neuropathological characteristics of FXTAS. We show elevated levels of 
      corticosterone in serum and ubiquitin-positive inclusions in both the pituitary 
      and adrenal gland of 100-week-old animals. In addition, we demonstrate 
      ubiquitin-positive inclusions in the amygdala from aged expanded CGG-repeat mice. 
      We hypothesize that altered regulation of the HPA axis and the amygdala and 
      higher stress hormone levels in the mouse model for FXTAS may explain associated 
      psychological symptoms in humans.

AB  - The gene responsible for fragile X syndrome, fragile X mental retardation-1 
      (FMR1), contains an unstable repeat sequence of (CGG)(n). Additionally, an 
      upstream promoter region of the gene--a CpG island--is abnormally methylated in 
      most affected individuals. Amplification of CGG repeats and abnormal methylation 
      show a correlation with affected status. The first basic and alternate protocols 
      in this unit outline the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to rapidly 
      detect the size of the repeat amplification. The second basic protocol describes 
      the assessment of fragile X syndrome by direct Southern blot hybridization of 
      genomic DNA digested with a pair of restriction enzymes, one of which is 
      methylation-sensitive. Extent of amplification and level of methylation can be 
      simultaneously detected. A combination of the two techniques can be used to 
      characterize the genotypes of individual members in identified fragile X 
      families.

TI  - Abnormal nerve conduction features in fragile X premutation carriers.
PG  - 495-8
LID - 10.1001/archneur.65.4.495 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Distal neuropathy is part of the clinical phenotype in most males 
      with the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) caused by the 55 to 
      200 CGG repeat expansion. METHODS: We performed nerve conduction studies in 16 
      male carriers with FXTAS, 11 non-FXTAS carriers, and 11 control subjects and 
      assessed the outcomes with respect to the fragile X mental retardation 1 genotype 
      (FMR1) (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] 309550; NT011681) and 
      messenger RNA expression. RESULTS: Men with FXTAS had slower tibial nerve 
      conduction velocities and prolonged F-wave latencies compared with controls (z = 
      2.06, P = .04; and z = 2.73, P = .005) and unaffected premutation males (z = 
      1.98, P = .04; and z = 2.00, P = .04). Compound muscle action potential 
      amplitudes were smaller in the FXTAS group relative to controls. Sural nerve 
      action potential amplitudes were reduced in the FXTAS group compared with 
      controls. After controlling for age, there was a significant relationship between 
      the longer CGG repeat number and tibial nerve conduction velocity slowing (r = 
      -0.42, P = .04) and between elevated messenger RNA levels and reduction of the 
      tibial compound muscle action potential velocity (r = -0.52, P = .01) in the 
      permutation group. CONCLUSIONS: Male premutation carriers had significant 
      conduction abnormalities of motor and sensory nerves that correlated with 
      molecular measures, suggesting that the premutation FMR1 genotype is a causal 
      factor. There was also evidence of nerve conduction abnormalities in non-FXTAS 
      carriers compared with controls, which suggests that the neuropathy can occur 
      without the full clinical presentation of FXTAS.

TI  - A single nucleotide variant in the FMR1 CGG repeat results in a "Pseudodeletion" 
      and is not associated with the fragile X syndrome phenotype.
PG  - 272-5
LID - 10.2353/jmoldx.2008.070163 [doi]
AB  - The molecular diagnosis of fragile X syndrome relies on the detection of the 
      pathogenic CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene. Deletions and point mutations 
      have occasionally been reported. Rare polymorphisms might mimic a deletion by 
      Southern blot analysis, leading to false-positive results. We describe a novel 
      rare nucleotide substitution within the CGG repeat. The proband was a woman with 
      a positive family history of mental retardation. Southern blot analysis showed an 
      additional band consistent with a deletion in the region detected by the StB12.3 
      probe. Sequencing of this region revealed a G>C transversion that interrupts the 
      CGG repeat and introduces an EagI site. The same variant was observed in both the 
      healthy son and father of the proband, supporting the hypothesis that the 
      nucleotide substitution is a silent polymorphism, the frequency of which we 
      estimated to be less than 1% in the general population. These findings argue for 
      a pathogenic role of nucleotide variants within the CGG repeat and suggest 
      possible consequences of unexpected findings in the molecular diagnostics of 
      fragile X syndrome. Thus, although the sequence context of a single nucleotide 
      substitution may not predict possible effects on mRNA or protein function, a 
      specific change in the higher order structures of DNA or mRNA may be functionally 
      relevant in the pathological phenotype.

TI  - A pilot study of premature ovarian senescence: I. Correlation of triple CGG 
      repeats on the FMR1 gene to ovarian reserve parameters FSH and anti-Mullerian 
      hormone.
PG  - 1700-6
LID - 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.01.098 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the number of triple CGG expansion of the FMR1 
      (fragile X) gene, known to correlate at premutation (55-200 repeats) and full 
      mutation (>200 repeats) ranges with risk toward premature ovarian failure (POF), 
      also correlates with milder forms of premature ovarian senescence. DESIGN: 
      Retrospective, controlled cohort study. SETTING: Academically affiliated, private 
      fertility center. PATIENT(S): Forty consecutive, new infertility patients, of 
      which 11 presented with a primary diagnosis of repeated pregnancy loss 
      (controls), 23 with prematurely elevated, age-specific baseline follicle 
      stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (i.e., premature ovarian aging, POA) and 6 with 
      POF. INTERVENTION(S): Determination of number of triple CGG repeats on both 
      alleles of FMR1 gene and of FSH and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels as a 
      reflection of ovarian reserve. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Statistical correlation 
      of higher (allele-2) triple repeat counts with patients' clinical diagnoses and 
      with FSH and AMH levels. RESULT(S): Mean triple CGG counts increased in parallel 
      to increasing severity of premature ovarian senescence. Repeat expansion numbers 
      at all levels correlated statistically to FSH. An AMH level of <1.0 ng/mL 
      statistically correlated to >32 triple repeats. CONCLUSION(S): Over 30 triple CGG 
      repeats denote increased risk (and severity) toward premature ovarian senescence 
      in parallel to increasing expansions. Numbers, considered well within the normal 
      range, therefore already denote risk, suggesting that CGG repeats may represent a 
      new test to predict ovarian function and assess female infertility.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of hereditary mental retardation. The 
      molecular basis of this syndrome is mainly a CGG expansion in the 5' untranslated 
      region of the FMR1 gene. Expansions with more than 200 CGG repeats abolish gene 
      expression causing the classical fragile X phenotype. Premutation carriers 
      (55-200 CGG) have normal cognitive function with increased risk of developing 
      premature ovarian failure and fragile X-associated tremor-ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS). Some clinical features associated with FXTAS, such as tremor, gait 
      ataxia, cognitive decline, and generalized brain atrophy, are also seen in other 
      movement disorders. Ninety-five patients referred for HD, who tested negative for 
      the expansion in the IT15 gene, were screened for FMR1 CGG-repeat expansion. One 
      FMR1 premutation male carrier was detected, giving an FXTAS frequency of 1.6%. 
      Our results highlight that FXTAS is still not well diagnosed; therefore, we 
      recommend FMR1 premutation screenings in all patients with late-onset tremor, 
      ataxia, and cognitive dysfunction.

TI  - Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency: evidence for additional 
      genetic contributions to severity.
PG  - 553-9
LID - 10.1002/gepi.20329 [doi]
AB  - The fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR1) contains a CGG repeat sequence in 
      its 5' untranslated region that can become unstable and expand in length from 
      generation to generation. Alleles with expanded repeats in the range of 
      approximately 55-199, termed premutation alleles, are associated with an 
      increased risk for fragile-X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). 
      However, not all women who carry the premutation develop FXPOI. To determine if 
      additional genes could explain variability in onset and severity, we used a 
      random-effects Cox proportional hazards model to analyze age at menopause on 680 
      women from 225 families who have a history of fragile X syndrome and 321 women 
      from 219 families from the general population. We tested for the presence of a 
      residual additive genetic effect after adjustment for FMR1 repeat length, race, 
      smoking, body mass index, and method of ascertainment. Results showed significant 
      familial aggregation of age at menopause with an estimated additive genetic 
      variance of 0.55-0.96 depending on the parameterization of FMR1 repeat size and 
      definition of age at menopause (P-values ranging between 0.0002 and 0.0027). This 
      is the first study to analyze familial aggregation of FXPOI. This result is 
      important for proper counseling of women who carry FMR1 premutation alleles and 
      for guidance of future studies to identify additional genes that influence 
      ovarian insufficiency.

TI  - Prevalence and instability of fragile X alleles: implications for offering 
      fragile X prenatal diagnosis.
PG  - 596-601
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0b013e318163be0b [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To document fragile X allele frequencies in a national referral 
      population and evaluate CGG repeat expansion in mother-offspring transmissions. 
      METHODS: Fragile X DNA analysis by Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction 
      was completed for 14,675 women, aged 18 years or older, and 238 mother-offspring 
      pairs between January 1999 and June 2004. Carrier frequencies were compared 
      between groups referred for different clinical indications. Direct comparison of 
      the FMR1 gene CGG repeat size in mother-offspring pairs determined intermediate 
      and premutation allele stability. RESULTS: Intermediate fragile X alleles (45-54 
      CGG repeats) occurred in 257 (1 in 57). The combined total number of patients 
      with a premutation (55-200 CGG repeats) or full mutation (more than 200 CGG 
      repeats) numbered 208 (1 in 71). One in 3.5 women with a family history of 
      fragile X and 1 in 10 with premature ovarian failure had a FMR1 mutation. This 
      compared with 1 in 86 for those with a family history of mental retardation and 1 
      in 257 for women with no known risk factors for fragile X. Among 238 
      mother-offspring pairings, the smallest allele to expand to a full mutation in 
      one generation contained 60 CGG repeats. Although 6.6% (4 of 60) of intermediate 
      repeat alleles did expand, none jumped to a clinically significant full 
      mutation-sized allele. CONCLUSION: Based on these data and other published 
      literature, offering invasive prenatal diagnosis for fragile X syndrome is not 
      indicated for women with intermediate alleles. Invasive prenatal diagnosis is 
      warranted for those women with a fragile X allele containing 55 or more CGG 
      repeats.

TI  - Impact of the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene premutation on 
      neuropsychiatric functioning in adult males without fragile X-associated 
      Tremor/Ataxia syndrome: a controlled study.
PG  - 859-72
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.30685 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X Syndrome is the most common heritable form of mental retardation caused 
      by silencing of the FMR1 gene, which arises from intergenerational trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion leading to full mutation. An intermediary carrier condition, 
      known as the premutation, is characterized by expansion up to 200 repeats without 
      concomitant gene silencing. This prevalent allelic variant was initially thought 
      to be free of phenotypic effects. However, recent reports have identified a 
      degenerative disease, Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) in 
      older men as well as premature ovarian failure in women. Previously reports are 
      inconsistent regarding the neuropsychiatric phenotype associated with premutation 
      due to small sample sizes, ascertainment bias, lack of adequate control groups, 
      administration of measures with poor psychometric properties, and the confounding 
      effects of FXTAS. We addressed these problems by conducting a controlled study of 
      male carriers (n = 40) of the premutation without manifest symptoms of FXTAS, 
      comparing their responses on specific, reliable, and valid measures of 
      neuropsychiatric functioning to those of individuals with shared family 
      environment (n = 22) and non-carrier comparison males (n = 43). Multivariate 
      analyses revealed that the premutation confers significant risk for working 
      memory difficulties, an associated feature of Attention-Deficit Disorder. 
      Furthermore, both the family controls and men with premutation exhibited higher 
      rates of Alcohol Abuse as compared to non-carrier control men. These findings 
      highlight the importance of recognizing the distinct phenotypic outcomes that 
      characterize the Fragile X premutation and the subtle risk factors that can act 
      as precursors to more significant psychiatric impairment.

PG  - 2-12
LID - 10.2353/jmoldx.2008.070105 [doi]
AB  - Fragile X syndrome, which is caused by expansion of a (CGG)(n) repeat in the FMR1 
      gene, occurs in approximately 1:3500 males and causes mental 
      retardation/behavioral problems. Smaller (CGG)(n) repeat expansions in FMR1, 
      premutations, are associated with premature ovarian failure and fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome. An FMR1-sizing assay is technically 
      challenging because of high GC content of the (CGG)(n) repeat, the size 
      limitations of conventional PCR, and a lack of reference materials available for 
      test development/validation and routine quality control. The Centers for Disease 
      Control and Prevention and the Association for Molecular Pathology, together with 
      the genetic testing community, have addressed the need for characterized fragile 
      X mutation reference materials by developing characterized DNA samples from 16 
      cell lines with repeat lengths representing important phenotypic classes and 
      diagnostic cutoffs. The alleles in these materials were characterized by 
      consensus analysis in nine clinical laboratories. The information generated from 
      this study is available on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 
      Coriell Cell Repositories websites. DNA purified from these cell lines is 
      available to the genetics community through the Coriell Cell Repositories. The 
      public availability of these reference materials should help support accurate 
      clinical fragile X syndrome testing.

TI  - ATR protects the genome against CGG.CCG-repeat expansion in Fragile X premutation 
      mice.
PG  - 1050-6
AB  - Fragile X mental retardation syndrome is a repeat expansion disease caused by 
      expansion of a CGG.CCG-repeat tract in the 5' UTR of the FMR1 gene. In humans, 
      small expansions occur more frequently on paternal transmission while large 
      expansions are exclusively maternal in origin. It has been suggested that 
      expansion is the result of aberrant DNA replication, repair or recombination. To 
      distinguish amongst these possibilities we crossed mice containing 120 
      CGG.CCG-repeats in the 5' UTR of the mouse Fmr1 gene to mice with mutations in 
      ATR, a protein important in the cellular response to stalled replication forks 
      and bulky DNA lesions. We show here that ATR heterozygosity results in increased 
      expansion rates of maternally, but not paternally, transmitted alleles. In 
      addition, age-related somatic expansions occurred in mice of both genders that 
      were not seen in ATR wild-type animals. Some ATR-sensitive expansion occurs in 
      postmitotic cells including haploid gametes suggesting that aberrant DNA repair 
      is responsible. Our data suggest that two mechanisms of repeat expansion exist 
      that may explain the small and large expansions seen in humans. In addition, our 
      data provide an explanation for the maternal bias of large expansions in humans 
      and the lower incidence of these expansions in mice.

TI  - FMR1 CGG repeat length predicts motor dysfunction in premutation carriers.
PG  - 1397-402
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a recently 
      described, underrecognized neurodegenerative disorder of aging fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) premutation carriers, particularly men. Core motor features 
      are action tremor, gait ataxia, and parkinsonism. Carriers have expanded CGG 
      repeats (55 to 200); larger expansions cause fragile X syndrome, the most common 
      heritable cause of mental retardation and autism. This study determines whether 
      CGG repeat length correlates with severity and type of motor dysfunction in 
      premutation carriers. METHODS: Persons aged >or=50 years with a family history of 
      fragile X syndrome underwent structured videotaping. Movement disorder 
      neurologists, blinded to carrier status, scored the tapes using modified 
      standardized rating scales. CGG repeat length analyses for women incorporated the 
      activation ratio, which measures the percentage of normal active chromosome X 
      alleles. RESULTS: Male carriers (n = 54) had significantly worse total motor 
      scores, especially in tremor and ataxia, than age-matched male noncarriers (n = 
      51). There was a trend toward a difference between women carriers (n = 82) and 
      noncarriers (n = 39). In men, increasing CGG repeat correlated with greater 
      impairment in all motor signs. In women, when activation ratio was considered, 
      increasing CGG correlated with greater ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: CGG repeat size is 
      significantly associated with overall motor impairment in premutation carriers. 
      Whereas this association is most pronounced for men and covers overall motor 
      impairment-tremor, ataxia, and parkinsonism-the association exists for ataxia 
      among women carriers. This is the first report of a significant correlation 
      between the premutation status and a motor feature of fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome in women.

TI  - Volumetric brain changes in females with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome (FXTAS).
PG  - 851-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder occurring in male and rare female carriers of a 
      premutation expansion (55 to 200 CGG repeats) of the fragile X mental retardation 
      1 (FMR1) gene. METHODS: Volumetric MRI studies, clinical staging, cognitive 
      testing, and molecular analysis were conducted in 15 female premutation carriers 
      affected by FXTAS (age 59.5 +/- 10.3 years), 20 unaffected female carriers (43.3 
      +/- 11.2 years), 11 genetically normal female controls (51.0 +/- 10.3 years), 36 
      affected male carriers (65.0 +/- 5.6 years), 25 unaffected male carriers (53.5 
      +/- 12.5 years), and 39 male controls (58.0 +/- 15.0 years). Female and male 
      carriers with FXTAS were matched on duration of disease. RESULTS: We found less 
      pronounced reductions of cerebellar volume and a lower incidence of involvement 
      (symmetric high T2 signal) of the middle cerebellar peduncles (MCP sign) in 
      females affected by FXTAS (13%) compared with affected males (58%). We found 
      reduced brain volumes and increased white matter disease associated with the 
      presence of FXTAS in females compared with female controls. We also observed 
      significant associations between reduced cerebellar volume and both increased 
      severity of FXTAS symptoms and increased length of the CGG repeat expansion in 
      male premutation carriers, but not in females. CONCLUSIONS: Females affected by 
      fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) demonstrated milder brain 
      changes than affected males, although they showed a similar pattern of radiologic 
      findings consistent with brain atrophy and white matter disease. FXTAS should be 
      considered (by ordering fragile X DNA testing) in females who present with 
      late-onset ataxia, action tremor, or neuropathy, particularly in those with a 
      family history of mental retardation, autism, or premature ovarian failure.

TI  - Pur alpha binds to rCGG repeats and modulates repeat-mediated neurodegeneration 
      in a Drosophila model of fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome.
PG  - 556-64
AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a recently recognized 
      neurodegenerative disorder in fragile X premutation carriers with FMR1 alleles 
      containing 55-200 CGG repeats. Previously, we developed a Drosophila model of 
      FXTAS and demonstrated that transcribed premutation repeats alone are sufficient 
      to cause neurodegeneration, suggesting that rCGG-repeat-binding proteins (RBPs) 
      may be sequestered from their normal function by rCGG binding. Here, we identify 
      Pur alpha and hnRNP A2/B1 as RBPs. We show that Pur alpha and rCGG repeats 
      interact in a sequence-specific fashion that is conserved between mammals and 
      Drosophila. Overexpression of Pur alpha in Drosophila could suppress 
      rCGG-mediated neurodegeneration in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, Pur 
      alpha is also present in the inclusions of FXTAS patient brains. These findings 
      support the disease mechanism of FXTAS of rCGG repeat sequestration of specific 
      RBPs, leading to neuronal cell death, and implicate that Pur alpha plays an 
      important role in the pathogenesis of FXTAS.

TI  - Closely linked cis-acting modifier of expansion of the CGG repeat in high risk 
      FMR1 haplotypes.
PG  - 1216-24
AB  - In its expanded form, the fragile X triplet repeat at Xq27.3 gives rise to the 
      most common form of inherited mental retardation, fragile X syndrome. This high 
      population frequency persists despite strong selective pressure against 
      mutation-bearing chromosomes. Males carrying the full mutation rarely reproduce 
      and females heterozygous for the premutation allele are at risk of premature 
      ovarian failure. Our diagnostic facility and previous research have provided a 
      large databank of X chromosomes that have been tested for the FRAXA allele. Using 
      this resource, we have conducted a detailed genetic association study of the 
      FRAXA region to determine any cis-acting factors that predispose to expansion of 
      the CGG triplet repeat. We have genotyped SNP variants across a 650-kb tract 
      centered on FRAXA in a sample of 877 expanded and normal X chromosomes. These 
      chromosomes were selected to be representative of the haplotypic diversity 
      encountered in our population. We found expansion status to be strongly 
      associated with a approximately 50-kb region proximal to the fragile site. 
      Subsequent detailed analyses of this region revealed no specific genetic 
      determinants for the whole population. However, stratification of chromosomes by 
      risk subgroups enabled us to identify a common SNP variant which cosegregates 
      with the subset of D group haplotypes at highest risk of expansion 
      (chi(1)(2)=17.84, p=0.00002). We have verified that this SNP acts as a marker of 
      repeat expansion in three independent samples.

TI  - Argonaute-2-dependent rescue of a Drosophila model of FXTAS by FRAXE premutation 
      repeat.
PG  - 2326-32
AB  - Fragile X Syndrome is the most common form of hereditary mental retardation. It 
      is caused by a large expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat (>200 repeats) in 
      the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of the FMR1 gene that leads to silencing of its 
      transcript. Individuals with CGG repeat expansions approximately between 60 and 
      200 are referred to as premutation carriers. Fragile X-associated tremor and 
      ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), an RNA-mediated neurodegenerative disease has been 
      described in up to 50% of males carrying premutation alleles. FRAXE, the most 
      common form of non-syndromic X-linked mental retardation, is caused by expansion 
      of a CCG trinucleotide repeat (>200) in the 5'-UTR of the FMR2 gene. While the 
      FRAXE premutation length repeat is observed in the general population, there has 
      not yet been a report of a neurodegenerative phenotype associated with these 
      alleles. In this study, we show that the CCG premutation length repeat leads to 
      an RNA-mediated neurodegenerative phenotype in a Drosophila model. Furthermore, 
      we show that co-expression of both the CCG and CGG-containing RNAs suppresses 
      their independent toxicity and is dependent on the RNAi pathway. These data 
      support the concept that RNA toxicity is the mechanism of neuronal toxicity and 
      suggests potential reversal of RNA-mediated phenotypes with complementary RNA 
      molecules.

TI  - Cognitive, anxiety and mood disorders in the fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome.
PG  - 349-56
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated patients with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS), a neurodegenerative disorder associated with a CGG repeat expansion in 
      the premutation range in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. METHODS: 
      Neurological, psychiatric and neuropsychological evaluations were performed on 15 
      male patients with FXTAS. RESULTS: Seven cases were diagnosed with dementia, and 
      seven others were diagnosed with mood and/or anxiety disorders. Twelve subjects 
      demonstrated deficits on neuropsychological testing. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians 
      assessing dementia patients are urged to consider this newly described syndrome, 
      especially in patients with dementia associated with a movement disorder and in 
      those with a family history of mental retardation. If FXTAS is a possible 
      diagnosis, physicians may carry out FMR1 DNA testing; patients who test positive 
      on DNA testing should undergo magnetic resonance imaging, be referred to 
      neurology and receive genetic counseling.

TI  - Identification of the porcine homologous of human disease causing trinucleotide 
      repeat sequences.
PG  - 207-18
AB  - Expansion in the repeat number of intragenic trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) is 
      associated with a variety of inherited human neurodegenerative diseases. To study 
      the composition of TNRs in a mammalian species representing an evolutionary 
      intermediate between humans and rodents, we describe in this paper the 
      identification of porcine noncoding and polyglutamine-encoding TNR regions and 
      the comparison to the homologous TNRs from human, chimpanzee, dog, opossum, rat, 
      and mouse. Several of the porcine TNR regions are highly polymorphic both within 
      and between different breeds. The TNR regions are more conserved in terms of 
      repeat length between humans and pigs than between humans and rodents suggesting 
      that TNR lengths could be implicated in mammalian evolution. The TNRs in the 
      FMR2, SCA6, SCA12, and Huntingtin genes are comparable in length to alleles 
      naturally occurring in humans, and also in FMR1, a long uninterrupted CGG TNR was 
      identified. Most strikingly, we identified a Huntingtin allele with 21 
      uninterrupted CAG repeats encoding a stretch of 24 polyglutamines. Examination of 
      this particular Huntingtin TNR in 349 porcine offspring showed stable 
      transmission. The presence in the porcine genome of TNRs within genes that, in 
      humans, can undergo pathogenic expansions support the usage of the pig as an 
      alternative animal model for studies of TNR evolution, stability, and functional 
      properties.

TI  - Regional FMRP deficits and large repeat expansions into the full mutation range 
      in a new Fragile X premutation mouse model.
PG  - 125-34
AB  - Carriers of FMR1 alleles with 55-200 repeats in the 5' UTR are at risk for 
      Fragile X associated tremor and ataxia syndrome. The cause of the neuropathology 
      is unknown but is thought to be RNA-mediated. Maternally transmitted premutation 
      alleles are also at risk of expansion of the repeat tract into the "full 
      mutation" range (>200 repeats). The mechanism responsible for expansion is 
      unknown. Full mutation alleles produce reduced amounts of the FMR1 gene product, 
      FMRP, which leads to Fragile X mental retardation syndrome. We have developed a 
      murine model for Fragile X premutation carriers that recapitulates key features 
      seen in humans including a direct relationship between repeat number and Fmr1 
      mRNA levels, an inverse relationship with FMRP levels and Purkinje cell dropout 
      that have not been seen in a previously described knock-in mouse model. In 
      addition, these mice also show a differential deficit of FMRP in different parts 
      of the brain that might account for symptoms of the full mutation that are seen 
      in premutation carriers. As in humans, repeat instability is high with expansions 
      predominating and, for the first time in a mouse model, large expansions into the 
      full mutation range are seen that occur within a single generation. Thus, 
      contrary to what was previously thought, mice may be good models not only for the 
      symptoms seen in human carriers of FMR1 premutation alleles but also for 
      understanding the mechanism responsible for repeat expansion, a phenomenon that 
      is responsible for a number of neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders.

TI  - CGG repeat length correlates with age of onset of motor signs of the fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).
PG  - 566-9
AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a late-onset neurological 
      disorder among carriers of premutation CGG-repeat expansions within the FMR1 
      gene. Principal features of FXTAS include progressive action tremor and gait 
      ataxia, with associated features of parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy, 
      dysautonomia, and cognitive decline. Although both clinical and neuropathologic 
      features of FXTAS are known to be highly associated with CGG repeat length, the 
      relationship between repeat length and age-of-onset is not known. To address this 
      issue, the ages of onset of action tremor and gait ataxia were documented by 
      history for 93 male carriers. For this cohort, the mean ages of onset were 62.6 
      +/- 8.1 years (range, 39-78 years) for tremor, and 63.6 +/- 7.3 years (range, 
      47-78 years) for ataxia; the mean CGG repeat number was 88.5 +/- 14 (range, 
      60-133). Analysis of the relationship between clinical onset and molecular 
      measures revealed significant correlations between CGG repeat number and onset of 
      both tremor (P = 0.001) and ataxia (P = 0.002), as well as overall onset (P < 
      0.0001). Our findings indicate that the CGG repeat number is a potential 
      predictor of the age of onset of core motor features of FXTAS.

TI  - Cytogenetic diagnosis of fragile X syndrome: study of 305 suspected cases in 
      Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 214-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of inherited mental 
      retardation. Patients with fragile X syndrome show variable mental disability, 
      typical long and narrow facial appearance with large ears and prominent 
      fontanelle and frequent macro-orchidism. It is generally associated with a 
      fragile site at Xq 27.3, which can be observed in the metaphase chromosome 
      following selective culture conditions. At the molecular level, the fragile X 
      syndrome is associated with an amplification of CGG repeat sequence of the FMR1 
      gene. The prevalence estimates are reported as one per 1500 males and one per 
      2500 females. Estimated prevalence rates of fragile X syndrome in different 
      ethnic groups range from 0.4-0.8 per 1000 in males and 0.2-0.6 per 1000 in 
      females. In this study, we have determined the frequency of fragile X-positive 
      cases in 305 preselected patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and five 
      Saudi patients with mental retardation/developmental delay/clinical suspicion of 
      fragile X syndrome were screened for fragile X chromosome by cytogenetic methods. 
      The majority of patients (95.59%) screened were under the age of 20 years. 
      RESULTS: Two hundred and ninety-nine patients (98.03%) were in the category of 
      mild to moderate mental retardation. Twenty-four males (7.86%) and two females 
      (0.65%) were found to express fragile X site at q27.3. The frequency of fragile 
      X-positive cells in males ranged between 7% and 58% (mean 26+/-13.11), while in 
      the females it was between 14% and 21% (mean 12.5+/-35), respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: The frequency of fragile X positive cases found in this study is 
      similar to other reports of fragile X syndrome in preselected patients.

TI  - Attitudes toward fragile X mutation carrier testing from women identified in a 
      general population survey.
PG  - 97-104
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is primarily due to a CGG repeat expansion found in the FMR1 
      X-linked gene. In a previous study, we conducted focus groups with women to 
      assess their attitudes towards fragile X carrier screening. In this follow-up 
      study, we conducted in-depth interviews of general population reproductive-age 
      women who were identified as carriers. We explored their attitudes toward testing 
      for carrier status of the fragile X mutation. These women underwent screening 
      primarily to participate in a research project rather than in search of a 
      diagnosis for specific symptoms. As such, these women were wholly unprepared for 
      positive carrier results. Their responses about their results and carrier 
      screening, in many cases, were being worked out over the course of the interview 
      itself. The most salient finding of this work is the apparent lack of relevance 
      of carrier status to these women. Many expressed that although the information 
      could be relevant in the future, it is not relevant at this stage of their lives 
      in terms of family planning (either with respect to having unaffected offspring 
      or to premature ovarian failure) and personal relationships. Although issues of 
      abortion seemed prominent in the focus groups, we found that carrier status did 
      not have an apparent effect on women's attitudes about termination. We 
      hypothesize this may be related to the fact that women had not processed their 
      new carrier status and had not related it to previously-formed personal opinions. 
      The findings of this work have significant implications for genetic counseling 
      and population screening. Genetic counselors should be mindful that general 
      population women may not recognize the immediate importance of their carrier 
      status even when literature is provided and discussed prior to providing a 
      sample. As part of comprehensive genetic counseling, counselors should identify 
      the reproductive life stage of the woman receiving the new information and help 
      her identify when this information would be more meaningful in her life. 
      Counselors can assist in setting up a personalized road map with specific types 
      of services that will be more applicable to the woman as her carrier status 
      becomes more relevant.

TI  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome--an older face of the fragile X gene.
PG  - 107-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: A 76-year-old man presented with an 8-year history of balance 
      problems and a 2-year history of short-term memory loss. He had also been 
      experiencing long-term problems with impotence and episodes of urinary 
      incontinence, and had been managed for hypertension for 25 years. His medical 
      history was otherwise unremarkable. Three of his grandchildren had been diagnosed 
      with fragile X syndrome. INVESTIGATIONS: Neurological examination, cognitive and 
      neuropsychological testing, nerve conduction studies, MRI, and genetic testing. 
      DIAGNOSIS: Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) resulting from a 
      premutation (CGG repeat) expansion of the FMR1 gene. MANAGEMENT: Explanation of 
      the genetic ramifications of premutation carrier status for the FMR1 gene, and 
      symptomatic treatment for the clinical difficulties experienced by the patient.

TI  - Impairment of executive cognitive functioning in males with fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome.
PG  - 645-50
AB  - The fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a recently identified 
      phenotype associated with trinucleotide repeat expansions in the premutation 
      range of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. In addition to 
      progressive gait ataxia, action tremor, peripheral neuropathy, and parkinsonism, 
      FXTAS involves impaired cognition. Our preliminary research suggests that 
      executive cognitive functioning (ECF) is especially affected. In this study, a 
      brief neuropsychological exam was administered to 33 men with FXTAS and 27 
      healthy controls. Compared with controls, individuals with FXTAS showed 
      statistically significant impairments on measures from the Wechsler Adult 
      Intelligence Scale, third edition (WAIS-III; verbal IQ, performance [nonverbal] 
      IQ, verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, and processing speed). FXTAS 
      subjects scored significantly lower on three of four measures of ECF and on two 
      tests of information processing speed. The results provide evidence that FXTAS 
      involves impairment of general intellectual functioning, with marked impairment 
      of executive cognitive abilities. The pattern of cognitive performance is 
      somewhat similar to that observed in the frontal variant of frontotemporal 
      dementia and several of the spinocerebellar ataxias, but differs from the 
      deficits observed in dementia of the Alzheimer type.

TI  - Neuropathic features in fragile X premutation carriers.
PG  - 19-26
AB  - Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a progressive neurological 
      condition occurring in fragile X premutation carriers, predominantly males, and 
      resulting in CNS dysfunction including tremor, ataxia, Parkinsonism, and 
      cognitive decline. Neuropathic signs have also been described. The objective of 
      this study was to compare neuropathic signs in fragile X premutation carriers 
      versus controls and determine the relationship of these signs to CGG repeat 
      length and tremor/ataxia. A neuropathy scale was utilized to compare distal 
      tendon reflexes and vibration sense in subjects from a large cohort of carriers 
      and controls undergoing neurological exam and structured videotaping sessions for 
      movement disorder rating. The male carrier group displayed more impairment on 
      total neuropathy, vibration and reflex scores than the corresponding control 
      group, while female carriers were not significantly different from controls. In 
      males, after correction for age effects, there was a correlation between CGG 
      repeat length and both total neuropathy and reflex impairments. Age-adjusted 
      partial correlation analyses showed an association between neuropathy scores and 
      severity of ataxia but not tremor in carrier males and females. These data 
      suggest that neuropathic signs are associated with the fragile X premutation, 
      presumably occurring through the same mechanism proposed for CNS disease, namely, 
      toxicity from expanded-CGG-repeat FMR1 mRNA.

TI  - Elevated Fmr1 mRNA levels and reduced protein expression in a mouse model with an 
      unmethylated Fragile X full mutation.
PG  - 244-53
AB  - The human FMR1 gene contains a CGG repeat in its 5' untranslated region. The 
      repeat length in the normal population is polymorphic (5-55 CGG repeats). Lengths 
      beyond 200 CGGs (full mutation) result in the absence of the FMR1 gene product, 
      FMRP, through abnormal methylation and gene silencing. This causes Fragile X 
      syndrome, the most common inherited form of mental retardation. Elderly carriers 
      of the premutation, defined as a repeat length between 55 and 200 CGGs, can 
      develop a progressive neurodegenerative syndrome: Fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). In FXTAS, FMR1 mRNA levels are elevated and it 
      has been hypothesised that FXTAS is caused by a pathogenic RNA gain-of-function 
      mechanism. We have developed a knock in mouse model carrying an expanded CGG 
      repeat (98 repeats), which shows repeat instability and displays biochemical, 
      phenotypic and neuropathological characteristics of FXTAS. Here, we report 
      further repeat instability, up to 230 CGGs. An expansion bias was observed, with 
      the largest expansion being 43 CGG units and the largest contraction 80 CGG 
      repeats. In humans, this length would be considered a full mutation and would be 
      expected to result in gene silencing. Mice carrying long repeats ( approximately 
      230 CGGs) display elevated mRNA levels and decreased FMRP levels, but absence of 
      abnormal methylation, suggesting that modelling the Fragile X full mutation in 
      mice requires additional repeats or other genetic manipulation.

TI  - A novel polyalanine expansion in FOXL2: the first evidence for a recessive form 
      of the blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) associated with ovarian dysfunction.
PG  - 107-12
AB  - The blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES) is an autosomal dominant developmental 
      disorder in which craniofacial/eyelid malformations are associated (type I) or 
      not (type II) with premature ovarian failure (POF). Mutations in the FOXL2 gene, 
      encoding a forkhead transcription factor, are responsible for both types of BPES. 
      Heterozygous polyalanine expansions of +10 residues (FOXL2-Ala24) account for 30% 
      of FOXL2 mutations and are fully penetrant for the eyelid phenotype. Here we 
      describe the first homozygous FOXL2 mutation leading to a polyalanine expansion 
      of +5 residues (FOXL2-Ala19). This novel mutation segregates in an Indian family 
      where heterozygous mutation carriers are unaffected whereas homozygous 
      individuals have the typical BPES phenotype, with proven POF in one female. 
      Expression of the FOXL2-Ala19 protein in COS-7 cells revealed a significantly 
      higher cytoplasmic retention compared to the wild-type protein. This is the first 
      study providing genetic evidence for a recessive inheritance of BPES associated 
      with ovarian dysfunction.

TI  - FMR1 CGG repeat patterns and flanking haplotypes in three Asian populations and 
      their relationship with repeat instability.
PG  - 784-96
AB  - Hyper-expansion of a CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene 
      followed by methylation and silencing is the predominant cause of Fragile X 
      syndrome, the most common inherited mental retardation disorder. Most detailed 
      studies of the FMR1 gene have focused on Caucasian populations and patients. We 
      performed a detailed haplotype and linkage disequilibrium analysis of the FMR1 
      gene in a total of 454 unselected normal X chromosomes from three Asian 
      populations, Chinese, Malay and Indian. Compared to Caucasians and African 
      Americans, the diversity of normal FMR1 CGG repeat lengths, patterns and flanking 
      haplotypes were lower in Asians. Strong linkage disequilibrium was observed 
      between the CGG repeat and flanking FMR1 markers in all three Asian populations, 
      with strong association between specific CGG repeat alleles and flanking marker 
      alleles observed only in the Chinese and Malays. A test for randomness of 
      distribution between FRAXA CGG repeat patterns and flanking FMR1 marker 
      haplotypes also revealed a highly significant non-random distribution between CGG 
      repeat patterns and flanking haplotypes in all three ethnic groups (P < 0.001). 
      Extending previous findings in Caucasians and African Americans we present a 
      novel statistical approach, using data from unselected population samples alone, 
      to show an association between absence of at least one AGG interruption in any 
      position (5', 3', or middle) and increased CGG repeat instability.

TI  - Impairment in the cognitive functioning of men with fragile X-associated 
      tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).
PG  - 227-33
AB  - Disorders associated with fragile X syndrome involve a trinucleotide (CGG) repeat 
      expansion in the FMR1 gene. Recently, a progressive movement disorder (fragile 
      X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome [FXTAS]) has been identified in premutation 
      carriers, persons with 55 to 200 CGG repeats. In addition to ataxia, action 
      tremor, and Parkinsonism, early case reports suggested that FXTAS involves 
      impaired cognition, but the precise nature of the impairment has not been 
      elucidated. In this first, preliminary study of the subject, circumscribed 
      aspects of cognitive functioning were examined in 25 men with FXTAS. Subjects' 
      performance on the cognitive tests was compared with normative data. Scores on 
      two measures of executive cognitive functioning showed a high prevalence of 
      substantial impairment. Capacity for inhibition was severely affected in 
      one-quarter of this highly educated sample; information processing speed was 
      profoundly impaired in most subjects. Although mean verbal and performance IQ 
      scores were not significantly different from the general population, they were 
      quite low given the sample's educational level. Cognitive and functional 
      impairment was greater for men with more CGG repeats, although number of repeats 
      was not associated with age of onset of either tremor or ataxia. The results 
      provide evidence that FXTAS involves marked impairment of executive cognitive 
      abilities.

TI  - Mosaicism for a full mutation, premutation, and deletion of the CGG repeats 
      results in 22% FMRP and elevated FMR1 mRNA levels in a high-functioning fragile X 
      male.
PG  - 1463-71
AB  - The molecular basis in the majority of fragile X patients results from expansion 
      of the CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene causing its transcriptional silencing and 
      deficiency of its encoded protein FMRP. In this communication, we report on a 
      male patient who lacks the characteristic physical features of fragile X and 
      carries a fully methylated mutation, a premutation, a non-methylated full 
      mutation, and a microdeletion encompassing the entire CGG repeat region and 42 bp 
      of upstream flanking sequence. Southern blot analysis revealed that the 
      methylated full mutation accounted for only 10% of his genotype while the 
      premutation/non-methylated full mutation and the microdeletion constituted 37% 
      and 53%, respectively. Immunofluorescent staining of FMRP demonstrated the 
      presence of 22% FMRP in his peripheral blood leukocytes and quantitative RT-PCR 
      revealed a 3.6-fold elevation of FMR1 mRNA levels. Developmental assessments 
      indicated that while he has a learning disability, he does not have mental 
      retardation. Because previous reports had noted that 28% FMRP expression is 
      associated with a characteristic fragile X phenotype, we propose that in our 
      patient the association of 22% FMRP levels with normal physical features and a 
      high-functioning status may have resulted from increased FMRP stability by a 
      mechanism that takes into account the CGG microdeletion and elevated mRNA levels.

TI  - Influence of intermediate and uninterrupted FMR1 CGG expansions in premature 
      ovarian failure manifestation.
PG  - 952-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies attempting to precisely define the range of fragile mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) expansions and its inf luence in premature ovarian failure 
      (POF) manifestation are partially lacking. To this aim, we evaluated a large 
      cohort of POF patients for the size and, in selected cases, for the sequence of 
      the CGG expansion. Furthermore, the correlation between POF and X-inactivation 
      was investigated in FRAXA families. METHODS: By fluorescent PCR, 190 POF and 200 
      control women were sized for the CGG tract; some subjects were also characterized 
      by sequencing and for the FMR1 activation ratio. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We found 
      a significant association (19/190, 10%, P < 1 x 10(-6)) between POF and FMR1 
      premutation (range 63-163 repeats) and a significant enrichment (9/190, 4.7%, P = 
      0.021) of POF carriers of intermediate expansions (range 41-58 repeats). 
      Interestingly, intermediate alleles were entirely composed of CGG repeats. 
      Furthermore, the analysis of three pairs of siblings with similar FMR1 expansions 
      and discordant for the POF phenotype showed a direct correlation between the 
      expression of the intermediate/premutated allele and POF manifestation. The 
      results obtained strengthen the correlation between FMR1 expansion and POF and 
      suggest that the manifestation of the ovarian dysfunction could be influenced 
      both by the pattern of interruption of the CGG repeat and by X-inactivation.

TI  - AGG interspersion analysis of the FMR1 CGG repeats in mental retardation of 
      unspecific cause.
PG  - 244-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the AGG interspersion pattern in mentally retarded patients 
      of unspecified cause. METHODS: FMR1 CGG substructure in 104 normal and 232 
      mentally retarded (MR) males was determined by CGG repeat and AGG interspersion 
      analyses. Genomic DNA of the study subjects was obtained for PCR and Southern 
      hybridization analyses. RESULTS: All study subjects had less than 53 CGG repeats 
      and none had fragile X syndrome of mental retardation. There was a significant 
      difference (P < 0.006) in the AGG interspersion pattern. MR males had (1) more 
      variable internal substructures, (2) proportionally less 2 and 3 AGG but more 0 
      and 1 AGG, less (CGG)(9)AGG(CGG)(9)AGG(CGG)(9) but more (CGG)(9)AGG(CGG)(19) 
      alleles and (3) a longer pure 3' CGG repeat. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest 
      that the MR alleles have a lesser number of interspersed AGG and a longer pure 3' 
      CGG repeat than the normal population. They are thus more prone to instability 
      and expansion to long repeat lengths as in the fragile X syndrome of mental 
      retardation.

TI  - An enhanced polymerase chain reaction assay to detect pre- and full mutation 
      alleles of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene.
PG  - 605-12
AB  - Several diagnostic strategies have been applied to the detection of FMR1 gene 
      repeat expansions in fragile X syndrome. Here, we report a novel polymerase chain 
      reaction-based strategy using the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche 
      Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and the osmolyte betaine. Repeat expansions up to 
      approximately 330 CGGs in males and up to at least approximately 160 CGGs in 
      carrier women could be easily visualized on ethidium bromide agarose gels. We 
      also demonstrated that fluorescence analysis of polymerase chain reaction 
      products was a reliable tool to verify the presence of premutation and full 
      mutation alleles both in males and in females. This technique, primarily designed 
      to detect premutation alleles, can be used as a routine first screen for expanded 
      FMR1 alleles.

TI  - Unfolding of higher DNA structures formed by the d(CGG) triplet repeat by UP1 
      protein.
PG  - 953-62
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is caused by expansion of a d(CGG) triplet repeat in the 
      5'-untranslated region of the first exon of the FMR1 gene resulting in silencing 
      of the gene. The d(CGG) repeat has been reported to form hairpin and quadruplex 
      structures in vitro, and formation of these higher structures could be 
      responsible for its unstable expansion in the syndrome, although molecular 
      mechanisms underlying the repeat expansion still remain elusive. We have 
      previously proved that UP1, a proteolytic product of hnRNP A1, unfolds the 
      intramolecular quadruplex structures of d(GGCAG)5 and d(TTAGGG)4 and abrogates 
      the arrest of DNA synthesis at d(GGG)n sites. Here, we demonstrate that the 
      d(CGG) repeat forms a peculiar DNA structure, which deviates from the canonical 
      B-form structure. In addition, UP1 was demonstrated by CD spectrum analysis to 
      unfold this characteristic higher structure of the d(CGG) repeat and to abrogate 
      the arrest of DNA synthesis at the site. This ability of UP1 suggests that 
      unfolding of unusual DNA structures of a triplet repeat is required for DNA 
      synthesis processes.

TI  - Women's attitudes toward testing for fragile X carrier status: a qualitative 
      analysis.
PG  - 295-306
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is primarily due to a repeat expansion mutation found in 
      the FMR1 X-linked gene. We have conducted a qualitative analysis of responses 
      from women concerning their attitudes toward testing for carrier status of the 
      fragile X mutation among reproductive-age women. We obtained responses from focus 
      groups including women with and without FXS in their families. We found the 
      following themes: (1) mothers of children with FXS have difficulty formulating 
      their opinions on population screening because of their unique experiences 
      surrounding their own carrier diagnosis and their relationship with their 
      children with FXS, (2) the motivation for carrier testing and need for 
      information differ by family history of FXS and parental status, and (3) the 
      timing of carrier testing with respect to a woman's life stage dictates whether 
      carrier information will be viewed as beneficial or detrimental. There was 
      evidence that non-carrier women from the general population would be wholly 
      unprepared for positive carrier results. These findings have significant 
      implications for genetic counseling as well as for population screening.

TI  - Genetic counseling for fragile x syndrome: updated recommendations of the 
      national society of genetic counselors.
PG  - 249-70
AB  - These recommendations describe the minimum standard criteria for genetic 
      counseling and testing of individuals and families with fragile X syndrome, as 
      well as carriers and potential carriers of a fragile X mutation. The original 
      guidelines (published in 2000) have been revised, replacing a stratified pre- and 
      full mutation model of fragile X syndrome with one based on a continuum of gene 
      effects across the full spectrum of FMR1 CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion. This 
      document reviews the molecular genetics of fragile X syndrome, clinical phenotype 
      (including the spectrum of premature ovarian failure and fragile X-associated 
      tremor-ataxia syndrome), indications for genetic testing and interpretation of 
      results, risks of transmission, family planning options, psychosocial issues, and 
      references for professional and patient resources. These recommendations are the 
      opinions of a multicenter working group of genetic counselors with expertise in 
      fragile X syndrome genetic counseling, and they are based on clinical experience, 
      review of pertinent English language articles, and reports of expert committees. 
      These recommendations should not be construed as dictating an exclusive course of 
      management, nor does use of such recommendations guarantee a particular outcome. 
      The professional judgment of a health care provider, familiar with the facts and 
      circumstances of a specific case, will always supersede these recommendations.

TI  - Examination of the effect of the polymorphic CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene on 
      cognitive performance.
PG  - 435-45
AB  - A CGG repeat sequence located in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene is 
      polymorphic with respect to size and stability of the repeat during 
      parent-offspring transmission. When expanded to over 200 repeats, the gene is 
      hypermethylated and silenced, leading to fragile X syndrome (FXS). Recently, 
      alleles with large unmethylated repeat tracts (premutations) have been associated 
      with ovarian failure and a late-onset tremor/ataxia syndrome, symptoms unrelated 
      to FXS. To further investigate the phenotype consequence of high repeat alleles, 
      we have analyzed Wechsler adult intelligence scales-III (WAIS-III) measures on 66 
      males and 217 females with a wide range of repeat sizes. Among females only, we 
      found that FMR1 repeat size and transcript level significantly explained 
      approximately 4% of the variance in the Verbal IQ summary measure, suggesting 
      that this polymorphism is one of many factors that influence variation in 
      cognitive performance. Because of the well established association of increasing 
      repeat size with decreasing age at menopause, we also investigated the 
      reproductive stage and use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) as a covariate to 
      model verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ). We found that it explained an 
      additional 5% of the variance in VIQ, but did not interact with FMR1 repeat and 
      transcript level.

TI  - The fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome in the differential diagnosis of multiple 
      system atrophy: data from the EMSA Study Group.
PG  - 1855-60
AB  - The recent identification of fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) 
      associated with premutations in the FMR1 gene and the possibility of clinical 
      overlap with multiple system atrophy (MSA) has raised important questions, such 
      as whether genetic testing for FXTAS should be performed routinely in MSA and 
      whether positive cases might affect the specificity of current MSA diagnostic 
      criteria. We genotyped 507 patients with clinically diagnosed or pathologically 
      proven MSA for FMR1 repeat length. Among the 426 clinically diagnosed cases, we 
      identified four patients carrying FMR1 premutations (0.94%). Within the subgroup 
      of patients with probable MSA-C, three of 76 patients (3.95%) carried 
      premutations. We identified no premutation carriers among 81 patients with 
      pathologically proven MSA and only one carrier among 622 controls (0.16%). Our 
      results suggest that, with proper application of current diagnostic criteria, 
      FXTAS is very unlikely to be confused with MSA. However, slowly progressive 
      disease or predominant tremor are useful red flags and should prompt the 
      consideration of FXTAS. On the basis of our data, the EMSA Study Group does not 
      recommend routine FMR1 genotyping in typical MSA patients.

TI  - Cognitive decline, neuromotor and behavioural disturbances in a mouse model for 
      fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).
PG  - 233-9
AB  - Carriers of premutation alleles (55-200 CGG repeats) of the fragile X mental 
      retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are spared the major neurodevelopmental symptomatology 
      of fragile X syndrome patients carrying a full mutation (>200 repeats). In a 
      proportion of premutation carriers, the repeat expansion is associated with a 
      specific neurological profile involving intention tremor, ataxia, intellectual 
      decline compatible with dementia syndrome, Parkinsonism and autonomic dysfunction 
      at older age, commonly referred to as fragile-X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS). Typical CNS changes include hyperintense signals on T2 weighted magnetic 
      resonance images and the presence of ubiquitin-positive intranuclear neuronal 
      inclusions. A knock-in mouse model with a (CGG)98 repeat in the premutation range 
      has been generated and shown to exhibit elevated Fmr1 mRNA levels and 
      ubiquitin-positive intranuclear neuronal inclusions, suggesting it may be a valid 
      model for the human disease. Given the specific clinical profile of FXTAS 
      patients, the expanded CGG repeat model was assessed for cognitive, behavioural 
      and neuromotor performance at different ages (20, 52 and 72 weeks). The Morris 
      water maze task exposed age-dependent decline of visual-spatial memory. Open 
      field recordings revealed decreased exploration of the centre of the arena in the 
      oldest group of expanded CGG repeat mice, potentially reflecting increased 
      anxiety. Neuromotor tasks primarily showed decline of performance on the 
      accelerating rotarod with age in the premutation carriers but not in control 
      littermates. The age-dependent cognitive decline and neuromotor disturbances may 
      be related to the progressive cognitive and behavioural difficulties observed in 
      FXTAS patients.

TI  - Evidence for, and a spectrum of, neurological involvement in carriers of the 
      fragile X pre-mutation: FXTAS and beyond.
PG  - 412-7
AB  - A neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS), occurs in some older men carrying a small CGG repeat expansion 
      (pre-mutation) in the FMR1 gene. We surveyed a sample of older pre-mutation males 
      to estimate the prevalence and spectrum of neurological involvement. Twelve 
      pre-mutation males aged 50-82 years and 11 age-matched normal controls 
      ascertained in an unbiased manner were included in a neurological assessment that 
      also used standard scales for tremor (Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor), ataxia 
      (International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale, ICARS) and parkinsonian signs 
      (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale). Axial FLAIR images of the brain, and 
      neuropsychological and molecular tests were also conducted in pre-mutation 
      carriers. The neurological disorder meeting all the criteria for diagnosis of 
      'definite' to 'possible' FXTAS occurred in five of 12 pre-mutation carriers 
      (41.7%), and this prevalence was significantly higher compared with normal 
      controls (0%). The ataxia (ICARS) score and the sum of all three tremor/ataxia 
      scores were significantly higher in pre-mutation carriers than in controls, and 
      mRNA was elevated in all but one carrier, but did not correlate with the degree 
      of neurological involvement. In conclusion, the findings provide further evidence 
      that the pre-mutation allele of FMR1 is a significant cause of late-onset 
      neurodegeneration, presenting with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations.

TI  - Differential epigenetic modifications in the FMR1 gene of the fragile X syndrome 
      after reactivating pharmacological treatments.
PG  - 641-8
AB  - The fragile X syndrome is caused by a >200 CGG repeat expansion within the FMR1 
      gene promoter, with consequent DNA hypermethylation and inactivation of its 
      expression. To further clarify the mechanisms that suppress the activity of the 
      mutant gene and the conditions that may permit its reactivation, we investigated 
      the acetylation and methylation status of three different regions of the FMR1 
      gene (promoter, exon 1 and exon 16) of three fragile X cell lines, using a 
      chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay with antibodies against 
      acetylated-H3/H4 histones and against dimethylated lysine residues K4 and K9 of 
      histone H3 (H3-K4 and H3-K9). We then coupled the ChIP assay with real-time PCR, 
      obtaining absolute quantification of immunoprecipitated chromatin. Basal levels 
      of histone acetylation and H3-K4 methylation were much higher in 
      transcriptionally active wild-type controls than in inactive fragile X cell 
      lines. Treatment of fragile X cell lines with the DNA demethylating drug 
      5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-azadC), known to reactivate the FMR1 gene, induced a 
      decrease of H3-K9 methylation, an increase of H3 and H4 acetylation and an 
      increase of H3-K4 methylation. Treatment with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC), a 
      compound that reduces the in vitro expression of the FRAXA fragile site without 
      affecting DNA methylation, caused an increase of H3 and H4 acetylation. However, 
      H3-K4 methylation remained extremely low, in accordance with the observation that 
      ALC alone does not reactivate the FMR1 gene. Our experiments indicate that H3-K4 
      methylation and DNA demethylation are the main epigenetic switches activating the 
      expression of the FMR1 gene, with histone acetylation playing an ancillary role.

TI  - Facile FMR1 mRNA structure regulation by interruptions in CGG repeats.
PG  - 451-63
AB  - RNA metabolism is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of clinical disorders 
      associated with premutation size alleles of the fragile X mental retardation 
      (FMR1) gene. Herein, we determined the structural properties of numerous FMR1 
      transcripts harboring different numbers of both CGG repeats and AGG 
      interruptions. The stability of hairpins formed by uninterrupted 
      repeat-containing transcripts increased with the lengthening of the repeat tract. 
      Even a single AGG interruption in the repeated sequence dramatically changed the 
      folding of the 5'UTR fragments, typically resulting in branched hairpin 
      structures. Transcripts containing different lengths of CGG repeats, but sharing 
      a common AGG pattern, adopted similar types of secondary structures. We postulate 
      that interruption-dependent structure variants of the FMR1 mRNA contribute to the 
      phenotype diversity, observed in premutation carriers.

TI  - Neural progenitor cells from an adult patient with fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 2
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no adequate animal model to study the detailed 
      molecular biochemistry of fragile X syndrome, the leading heritable form of 
      mental impairment. In this study, we sought to establish the use of immature 
      neural cells derived from adult tissues as a novel model of fragile X syndrome 
      that could be used to more fully understand the pathology of this neurogenetic 
      disease. METHODS: By modifying published methods for the harvest of neural 
      progenitor cells from the post-mortem human brain, neural cells were successfully 
      harvested and grown from post-mortem brain tissue of a 25-year-old adult male 
      with fragile X syndrome, and from brain tissue of a patient with no neurological 
      disease. RESULTS: The cultured fragile X cells displayed many of the 
      characteristics of neural progenitor cells, including nestin and CD133 
      expression, as well as the biochemical hallmarks of fragile X syndrome, including 
      CGG repeat expansion and a lack of FMRP expression. CONCLUSION: The successful 
      production of neural cells from an individual with fragile X syndrome opens a new 
      avenue for the scientific study of the molecular basis of this disorder, as well 
      as an approach for studying the efficacy of new therapeutic agents.

TI  - The emerging fragile X premutation phenotype: evidence from the domain of social 
      cognition.
PG  - 53-60
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by large 
      methylated expansions of a CGG repeat (>200) region upstream of the FMR1 gene 
      that results in the lack of expression of the fragile X mental retardation 
      protein (FMRP). Affected individuals display a neurobehavioral phenotype that 
      includes a significant impairment in social cognition alongside deficits in 
      attentional control, inhibition and working memory. In contrast, relatively 
      little is known about the trajectory and specificity of any cognitive impairment 
      associated with the fragile X premutation ("carrier-status") (approximately 
      55-200 repeats). Here, we focus on one aspect of cognition that has been well 
      documented in the fragile X full mutation, namely social cognition. The results 
      suggest that premutation males display a pattern of deficit similar in profile, 
      albeit milder in presentation, to that of the full mutation. However, little 
      evidence emerged for a correlation between CGG repeat length and severity of 
      phenotypic outcomes. The findings are discussed in the context of functional 
      neuroimaging and brain-behaviour-molecular correlates. We speculate that the 
      deficiencies in social cognition are attributable to impairment of neural 
      pathways modulated by the cerebellum.

TI  - The effect of pre-mutation of X chromosome CGG trinucleotide repeats on brain 
      anatomy.
PG  - 2672-81
AB  - Expanded trinucleotide repeats are associated with several neuropsychiatric 
      disorders, including fragile X syndrome (FraX) which is the most common inherited 
      form of mental retardation. It is currently thought that FraX results from having 
      >200 CGG trinucleotide repeats, with consequent methylation of the fragile X 
      mental retardation gene (FMR1) and loss of FMR1 protein (FMRP). Pre-mutation 
      carriers of FraX (with 55-200 CGG trinucleotide repeats) were originally 
      considered unaffected, although recent studies challenge this view. However, 
      there are few studies on the effect of pre-mutation trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion on the male human brain using quantitative MRI. Also the results of 
      prior investigations may be confounded because people were selected on the basis 
      of clinical and neurological features, and not genetic phenotype. We compared the 
      brain anatomy of 20 adult male pre-mutation members of known FraX families with 
      20 healthy male controls. The two groups did not differ significantly in age, 
      intelligence quotient (IQ) or handedness. We also investigated whether any 
      observed effects were associated with: (i) ageing; (ii) expansion of pre-mutation 
      CGG trinucleotide repeats; (iii) reduction in the percentage of lymphocytes 
      staining with anti-FMRP antibodies [%FMRP(+) lymphocytes]; and (iv) elevation of 
      FMR1 mRNA levels. Male pre-mutation carriers of FraX, compared with matched 
      controls, had significantly less voxel density in several brain regions, 
      including the cerebellum, amygdalo-hippocampal complex and thalamus. Within 
      pre-mutation carriers of FraX, ageing, increases in the number of CGG 
      trinucleotide repeats and decreases in %FMRP(+) lymphocytes were associated with 
      decreasing voxel density of regions previously identified as decreased relative 
      to controls. Regional grey and white matter density is significantly affected in 
      male pre-mutation carriers of FraX recruited on the basis of genetic, not 
      clinical, phenotype. The association of voxel density reduction and ageing is 
      consistent with observations of a subgroup of older pre-mutation males who 
      present with cognitive decline. Moreover, our findings suggest, for the first 
      time, an association between voxel density reduction and genetic variation in 
      FraX.

TI  - Loss of FMR1 hypermethylation in somatic cell heterokaryons.
PG  - 1964-6
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is associated with a trinucleotide (CGG) repeat expansion in 
      the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene and hypermethylation of the FMR1 
      promoter. Rare cases of clinically normal males (HFM) have been identified with 
      an expanded CGG repeat; however, here, the FMR1 promoter is not methylated. Using 
      classical complementation (cell fusion) studies, we analyzed if possible 
      differences in the genetic background between HFM and cells from individuals with 
      fragile X syndrome (FX cells) could have an influence on the methylation status 
      of the FMR1 promoter. We observed that demethylation of the hypermethylated FMR1 
      promoter can occur when FX cells are complemented (by cell fusion) with cells 
      from HFM as well as with cells from control individuals. The observed 
      demethylation is specific and can happen without DNA replication. In contrast, 
      demethylation was not observed when cells from unrelated individuals with fragile

TI  - Destabilization of tetraplex structures of the fragile X repeat sequence (CGG)n 
      is mediated by homolog-conserved domains in three members of the hnRNP family.
PG  - 4145-54
AB  - Hairpin or tetrahelical structures formed by a d(CGG)n sequence in the FMR1 gene 
      are thought to promote expansion of the repeat tract. Subsequent to this 
      expansion FMR1 is silenced and fragile X syndrome ensues. The injurious effects 
      of d(CGG)n secondary structures may potentially be countered by agents that act 
      to decrease their stability. We showed previously that the hnRNP-related protein 
      CBF-A destabilized G'2 bimolecular tetraplex structures of d(CGG)n. Analysis of 
      mutant proteins revealed that the CBF-A-conserved domains RNP11 and ATP/GTP 
      binding box were sufficient and necessary for G'2 d(CGG)n disruption while the 
      RNP21 motif inhibited the destabilization activity. Here, we report that a 
      C-terminal fragment of CBF-A whose only remaining conserved domain was the 
      ATP/GTP binding motif, disrupted G'2 d(CGG)n more selectively than wild-type 
      CBF-A. Further, two additional members of the hnRNP family, hnRNP A2 and mutant 
      hnRNP A1 effectively destabilized G'2 d(CGG)n. Examination of mutant hnRNP A2 
      proteins revealed that, similar to CBF-A, their RNP11 element and ATP/GTP binding 
      motif mediated G'2 d(CGG)n disruption, while the RNP21 element blocked their 
      action. Similarly, the RNP11 and RNP21 domains of hnRNP A1 were, respectively, 
      positive and negative mediators of G'2 d(CGG)n destabilization. Last, employing 
      the same conserved motifs that mediated disruption of the DNA tetraplex G'2 
      d(CGG)n, hnRNP A2 destabilized r(CGG)n RNA tetraplex.

TI  - Epstein-Barr virus transformation of human lymphoblastoid cells from patients 
      with fragile X syndrome induces variable changes on CGG repeats size and promoter 
      methylation.
PG  - 163-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our understanding of fragile X syndrome can be improved by reversing 
      the expression of the silenced fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene in 
      immortalized cells from these patients. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has 
      been extensively used to transform B cells into a permanent lymphoblastoid cell 
      line. METHODS: We immortalized B lymphocytes from three different fragile X 
      patients and one normal male. We analyzed the CGG triplet repeats and methylation 
      status of the FMR1 and interferon (IFN)-gamma promoter. We also assayed FMR1 mRNA 
      levels by real-time PCR and FMR1 protein (FMRP) by Western blot. RESULTS: We 
      observed that EBV transformation may induce the instability of CGG repeats and 
      DNA demethylation that can lead to the modification of mRNA expression. 
      CONCLUSIONS: EBV transformation may induce variable changes in the genome that 
      can lead to the misinterpretations of experimental data obtained from these 
      cells. Thus, periodic testing of DNA from immortalized cells should be routinely 
      undertaken to detect undesired effects.

TI  - Association and transmission analysis of the FMR1 IVS10 + 14C-T variant in 
      autism.
PG  - 54-6
AB  - Evidence from the high male to female ratio of individuals with autism as well as 
      suggestive linkage data have implicated the possible involvement of X chromosomal 
      loci in the aetiology of autism. Studies of the FMR1 gene on Xq27 have shown that 
      occasionally individuals, and particularly females, with the [CGG] repeat 
      expansion and methylation mutation may present with autistic symptoms. However, 
      molecular studies suggest that such mutations are not a major cause of autism. 
      Previously, we have screened autism probands for mutations in regions of the FMR1 
      gene downstream of the [CGG] repeat and identified an intronic variant in the 
      FMR1 gene, IVS10 + 14C-T, which was present at a significantly higher frequency 
      in autistic individuals compared to controls individuals. We have now 
      investigated this variant in a further 136 autism families and 186 control 
      individuals. We have established that the variant is significantly more frequent 
      among East Asian individuals within our affected and control groups (P < 0.0001) 
      and although we observed a trend of higher transmission frequency of the rare 
      allele to affected individuals, there was no significant evidence in either 
      family-based or case/control association studies for this variant in autism (P > 
      0.05).

TI  - Expansion to full mutation of a FMR1 intermediate allele over two generations.
PG  - 333-6
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is due to an expanded CGG repeat in the 5' UTR of the FMR1 
      gene. According to repeat size, we distinguish four allele categories: normal 
      (<40 CGG), intermediate (46-60 CGG), premutated (55-200 CGG) and full mutated 
      (>200 CGG). However, the boundaries among these categories are unclear, making it 
      difficult to classify unstable alleles and to estimate the risk of expansion. We 
      report a family with a proband, carrying a methylated full mutation with an 
      amplification of 1.2 kb. PCR analysis demonstrated two alleles of 29 and 61 CGGs 
      in the mother. Sequencing of the 61 CGG allele showed no AGG interruptions. Both 
      mother's sisters had two alleles of 31 and 44 CGGs, and the daughter of one of 
      these had two alleles of 22 and 44 repeats, demonstrating stable transmission of 
      the 44 CGG allele. The maternal grandfather was deceased, but haplotype 
      reconstruction using markers DXS548 and FRAXAC1 demonstrated that he was carrier 
      of the premutated allele. Furthermore, molecular analysis confirmed the same 
      paternity with a probability of 99.79% for all the three sisters. According to 
      these findings, it is likely that the maternal grandfather carried the 44 CGG 
      allele, showing unstable transmission, given that it expanded first to 61 CGGs in 
      one daughter, and then to full mutation in her child. Although we cannot exclude 
      paternal mosaicism, it is likely that a rare event of progression from an 
      intermediate to a premutated and on to a full mutated allele occurred in this 
      family over two generations.

TI  - Redistribution of transcription start sites within the FMR1 promoter region with 
      expansion of the downstream CGG-repeat element.
PG  - 543-9
AB  - Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of mental impairment, is caused by 
      expansion of a (CGG)n trinucleotide repeat element located in the 5' untranslated 
      region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Repeat expansion is 
      known to influence both transcription and translation; however, the mechanisms by 
      which the CGG element exerts its effects are not known. In the current work, we 
      have utilized 5'-RLM-RACE to examine the influence of CGG repeat number on the 
      utilization of transcription start sites in normal (n<55) and premutation 
      (54<n<200) cell lines of both non-neural (lymphoblastoid) and neural (primary 
      astrocyte) origin. Our results demonstrate that, in both neural and non-neural 
      cells, transcription of the FMR1 gene is initiated from several transcription 
      start sites within a approximately 50 nt region that lies approximately 130 nt 
      upstream of the CGG repeat element. For normal alleles, most transcripts initiate 
      from the downstream-most start site, close to the single position identified 
      previously. Surprisingly, as the size of the CGG repeat expands into the 
      premutation range, initiation shifts to the upstream sites, suggesting that the 
      CGG element may act as a downstream enhancer/modulator of transcription. The 
      shift in start site selection for both neural and non-neural cells indicates that 
      the effect is general. Furthermore, the correspondence between start site 
      utilization and the degree of elevation of FMR1 mRNA suggests that a substantial 
      fraction of the increased message in the premutation range may derive from the 
      upstream start sites.

TI  - MECP2 analysis in mentally retarded patients: implications for routine DNA 
      diagnostics.
PG  - 24-8
AB  - Rett syndrome (RTT) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders in 
      females. The disease is caused by mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 
      gene (MECP2), and various mutations have been reported. The phenotypic spectrum 
      in both female and male patients is diverse, ranging from very mild to congenital 
      encephalopathy and prenatal lethality. In this study, the question was addressed 
      as to whether implementation of systematic screening of MECP2 in patients with an 
      unexplained mental retardation in DNA diagnostics would be reasonable, and the 
      spectrum of phenotypes resulting from mutations in this gene was further 
      explored. Mutational analysis of MECP2 was performed in mentally retarded female 
      patients who were negative for FMR1 CGG repeat expansion, in male and female 
      patients with clinical features suggestive of either Angelman or Prader-Willi 
      syndrome without methylation defects on chromosome 15q11-q13. In the cohort of 
      females negative for the molecular Fragile-X studies (N=92), one nonsense 
      mutation (p.Q406X) was found. In the cohort of Angelman-negative patients (N=63), 
      two missense mutations (p.R133C in a female patient and a mosaic p.T158M in a 
      male patient) were found, which have been reported many times in patients with 
      classical RTT syndrome. In the Prader-Willi-negative group (N=98), no pathogenic 
      mutations were found. The results support testing of patients with features 
      suggestive of Angelman syndrome, but without methylation defects on chromosome 
      15q11-q13 for mutations in MECP2. In the remaining patients with unexplained 
      mental retardation, additional clinical features should determine whether 
      analysis of MECP2 is indicated.

TI  - The (CGG)n repeat element within the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 message 
      provides both positive and negative cis effects on in vivo translation of a 
      downstream reporter.
PG  - 3067-74
AB  - The human fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene contains a polymorphic (CGG) 
      trinucleotide repeat element in its 5' untranslated region. Expansion of the 
      (CGG)n element beyond 200 repeats (full mutation range) generally leads to 
      transcriptional silencing; consequent loss of the FMR1 protein (FMRP) results in 
      fragile X syndrome, the most frequent form of inherited mental impairment. For 
      carriers of smaller expansions (55< or =n< or =200; premutation range), FMRP 
      levels are gradually reduced with increasing repeat number, despite elevated FMR1 
      mRNA levels, suggesting that translation is impeded within the premutation range. 
      To examine in more detail the influence of the CGG repeat on translation, CMV 
      immediate-early promoter constructs, containing the FMR1 5'-UTR with various 
      (CGG)n repeat lengths (0< or =n< or =99) and a downstream (luciferase) reporter, 
      were transfected into two human cell lines, a neural cell-derived line (SK) and a 
      fetal kidney cell-derived line (293). For both cell types, the CGG element exerts 
      distinct effects on reporter expression, depending on the length of the repeat. 
      For n> or =30, luciferase expression decreases with increasing repeat length, 
      consistent with earlier observations of decreased FMRP expression in peripheral 
      blood leucocytes over the same repeat range, despite a slight increase in mRNA 
      level for the larger repeats. Surprisingly, for smaller alleles (0< or =n< or 
      =30), reporter expression actually increases by nearly two-fold with increasing 
      repeat length in the absence of any change in mRNA level. These results suggest 
      that the CGG repeat element can exert both positive (n<30) and negative (n>30) 
      effects on translation. Interestingly, optimal translation appears to occur near 
      the modal repeat number within the general human population.

TI  - DNA deamination enables direct PCR amplification of the cystatin B (CSTB) 
      gene-associated dodecamer repeat expansion in myoclonus epilepsy type 
      Unverricht-Lundborg.
PG  - 404-8
AB  - The Unverricht-Lundborg type of progressive myoclonus epilepsy (EPM1) is an 
      autosomal recessive disorder that is caused by the dysfunction of the cystatin B 
      (CSTB) gene product. In the vast majority of affected cases, mRNA transcription 
      is impaired by a biallelic expansion of a dodecamer repeat within the 
      5'-untranslated region of the respective gene. Since this minisatellite contains 
      exclusively G and C nucleotides, direct PCR analysis of allele expansion is 
      extremely difficult and error prone. To circumvent these problems, we have 
      developed a PCR assay that is based on the deamination of the DNA prior to 
      amplification. We have developed a method based on PCR after DNA deamination of 
      the GC-rich repeat region, which improves the PCR condition to such an extent 
      that we were not only able to reliably amplify expanded alleles of affected 
      individuals (homozygotes and compound heterozygotes), but also the two alleles of 
      full mutation carriers, whose analysis is particularly difficult because of PCR 
      bias and heteroduplex formation between the two alleles. We used promoter- and 
      repeat-specific primer combinations to investigate whether dodecamer repeat 
      expansion concurs with de novo methylation of the CSTB gene promoter in a similar 
      fashion to other repeat expansion syndromes. We confirmed previous evidence 
      obtained by HpaII digestion and Southern blot analysis that both the promoter and 
      the repeat regions are unmethylated, in both healthy and affected individuals. 
      Thus, in contrast to certain trinucleotide repeat expansion-associated diseases, 
      such as fragile X syndrome (FRAXA) and myotonic dystrophy, methylation analyses 
      can not be utilized for indirect diagnostic testing.

TI  - RNA-mediated neurodegeneration caused by the fragile X premutation rCGG repeats 
      in Drosophila.
PG  - 739-47
AB  - Fragile X syndrome carriers have FMR1 alleles, called premutations, with an 
      intermediate number of 5' untranslated CGG repeats between patients (>200 
      repeats) and normal individuals (<60 repeats). A novel neurodegenerative disease 
      has recently been appreciated in some premutation carriers. As no 
      neurodegeneration is seen in fragile X patients, who do not express FMR1, we 
      hypothesize that lengthened rCGG repeats of the premutation transcript may lead 
      to neurodegeneration. Here, using Drosophila melanogaster, we show that 90 rCGG 
      repeats alone are sufficient to cause neurodegeneration. This phenotype is neuron 
      specific and rCGG repeat dosage sensitive. Although devoid of mutant protein, 
      this neurodegeneration exhibits neuronal inclusion bodies that are Hsp70 and 
      ubiquitin positive. Overexpression of Hsp70 could suppress the neurodegeneration. 
      These results demonstrate that neurodegenerative phenotype associated with 
      fragile X premutation is indeed caused by the lengthened rCGG repeats and provide 
      the first in vivo experimental demonstration of RNA-mediated neurodegeneration.

TI  - Distribution of CGG repeat sizes within the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) 
      homologue in a non-human primate population.
PG  - 371-6
AB  - Fragile X syndrome, the most common inherited form of mental retardation, arises 
      in individuals with more than 200 CGG repeats in the 5' untranslated region of 
      the fragile X mental retardation 1 ( FMR1) gene. Although CGG repeat numbers 
      comparable to those found in the normal human population are found in various 
      non-human primates, neither the within-species size variation nor the propensity 
      for expansion of the CGG repeat has been described for any non-human primate 
      species. The allele distribution has now been determined for FMR1 (homologue) CGG 
      repeats of 265 unrelated founder females of Macaca mulatta monkeys. Among 530 X 
      chromosomes, at least 26 distinct repeat lengths were identified, ranging from 16 
      to 54 CGG repeats. Of these alleles 79% have between 25 and 33 CGG repeats. 
      Detailed examination of the CGG region revealed a conserved G (CGG)(2 )G 
      interruption, although in no case was an AGG trinucleotide detected. Two animals 
      carried borderline premutation alleles with 54 CGG repeats, within the region of 
      marginal instability for humans. Thus, M. mulatta may be useful as an animal 
      model for the study of fragile X syndrome.

TI  - The cationic porphyrin TMPyP4 destabilizes the tetraplex form of the fragile X 
      syndrome expanded sequence d(CGG)n.
PG  - 3963-70
AB  - Fragile X syndrome, the most common cause of inherited mental retardation, is 
      instigated by dynamic expansion of a d(CGG) trinucleotide repeat in the 
      5'-untranslated region of the first exon of the FMR1 gene, resulting in its 
      silencing. The expanded d(CGG)(n) tract readily folds into hairpin and tetraplex 
      structures which may contribute to the blocking of FMR1 transcription. In this 
      work, we report that the cationic porphyrin 
      5,10,15,20-tetra(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphin (TMPyP4) effectively destabilizes in 
      vitro the G'2 bimolecular tetraplex structure of d(CGG)(n) while it stabilizes 
      the G'2 tetraplex form of the telomeric sequence d(TTAGGG)(2). Similarly to 
      TMPyP4, the hnRNP-related protein CBF-A also destabilizes G'2 tetrahelical 
      d(CGG)(n) while binding and stabilizing tetraplex telomeric DNA. We report that 
      relative to each agent individually, successive incubation of G'2 d(CGG)(n) with 
      TMPyP4 followed by exposure to CBF-A results in a nearly additive extent of 
      disruption of this tetraplex form of the repeat sequence. Our observations open 
      up the prospect of unfolding secondary structures of the expanded FMR1 d(CGG)(n) 
      tract of fragile X cells by their exposure to low molecular size drugs or to 
      proteins such as TMPyP4 or CBF-A.

AB  - Malignancies in patients with fragile X syndrome are rarely reported. A

      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Cytogenetic analysis showed a stemline 46, 
      XY,t(9;22)(q34;qll) and a sideline 46,XY, t(8;14)(q24;qll), t(9;22)(q34;qll). 
      Molecular analysis of the FMR1 gene showed a neoplastic leukemic clone possessing 
      a full expansion of the CGG repeat, with associated aberrant methylation of the 
      promoter CpG islands. However, analysis during morphologic remission showed that 
      the promoter CpG island was apparently unmethylated in the regenerating normal 
      hematopoietic cells. During subsequent relapses, the FMRI CGG repeat was 
      unstable, with the appearance of multiple leukemic subclones possessing different 
      repeat expansions. Our case suggested that deregulation of the FMR1 gene might 
      have contributed to leukemogenesis in our case.

TI  - Fragile X (CGG)n repeats induce a transcriptional repression in cis upon a linked 
      promoter: evidence for a chromatin mediated effect.
PG  - 3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expansion of an unstable (CGG)n repeat to over 200 triplets within 
      the promoter region of the human FMR1 gene leads to extensive local methylation 
      and transcription silencing, resulting in the loss of FMRP protein and the 
      development of the clinical features of fragile X syndrome. The causative link 
      between (CGG)n expansion, methylation and gene silencing is unknown, although 
      gene silencing is associated with extensive changes to local chromatin 
      architecture. RESULTS: In order to determine the direct effects of increased 
      repeat length on gene transcription in a chromatin context, we have examined the 
      influence of FMR1 (CGG)n repeats upon transcription from the HSV thymidine kinase 
      promoter in the Xenopus laevis oocyte. We observe a reduction in mRNA production 
      directly associated with increasing repeat length, with a 90% reduction in mRNA 
      production from arrays over 100 repeats in length. Using a kinetic approach, we 
      show that this transcriptional repression is concomitant with chromatin 
      maturation and, using in vitro transcription, we show that chromatin formation is 
      a fundamental part of the repressive pathway mediated by (CGG)n repeats. Using 
      Trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, we show reactivation of the 
      silenced promoter. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, isolated fragile X associated (CGG)n repeat 
      arrays can exert a modifying and transcriptionally repressive influence over 
      adjacent promoters and this repressive phenomenon is, in part, mediated by 
      histone deacetylation.

TI  - The FMR1 CGG repeat and linked microsatellite markers in two Basque valleys.
PG  - 206-11
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is associated with an unstable CGG repeat sequence in the 5' 
      untranslated region of the first exon of the FMR1 gene. The present study 
      involved the evaluation of factors implicated in CGG repeat stability in a normal 
      sample from two Basque valleys (Markina and Arratia), to discover whether the 
      Basque population shows allelic diversity and to identify factors involved, by 
      using the data in conjunction with previous findings. The study was based on a 
      sample of 204 and 58 X chromosomes from the Markina and Arratia valleys, 
      respectively. The CGG repeat, the AGG interspersion and two flanking 
      microsatellite markers, FRAXAC1 and DXS548, were examined. In the Markina valley, 
      gray zone alleles (> or =35 CGG repeats) were associated with anchoring AGGs, 
      with the longest 3' pure CGG repeats of the valley (=15), with the 5' instability 
      structure 9+n and with one principal fragile X FRAXAC1-DXS548 haplotype 42-50. In 
      the Arratia valley, gray zone alleles (> or =35 CGG repeats) showed the highest 
      frequency among the Basque samples analyzed, and were associated with anchoring 
      AGGs, with the longest 3' pure repeats (> or =20), with the 5' instability 
      structure 9+n and with one "normal" FRAXAC1-DXS548 haplotype 38-40 (these data 
      from Arratia suggest the existence of a "protective" haplotype). The results 
      showed, on the one hand, differences between Markina and Arratia in factors 
      implicated in CGG repeat instability and, on the other hand, a great similarity 
      between the general Basque sample from Biscay and the Markina valley.

TI  - Reduced FMR1 mRNA translation efficiency in fragile X patients with premutations.
PG  - 1482-8
AB  - The Fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR1) contains a polymorphic trinucleotide 
      CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the FMR1 messenger. We have 
      characterized three lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated male 
      carriers of a premutation that overexpress FMR1 mRNA and show reduced FMRP level 
      compared to normal cells. The analysis of polysomes/mRNPs distribution of mRNA in 
      the cell lines with a premutation shows that the polysomal association of FMR1 
      mRNA, which is high in normal cells, becomes progressively lower with increasing 
      CGG repeat expansion. In addition, we could detect a very low level of FMR1 mRNA 
      in a lymphoblastoid cell line from a patient with a full mutation. In this case, 
      FMR1 mRNA is not at all associated with polysomes, in agreement with the complete 
      absence of FMRP. The impairment of FMR1 mRNA translation in patients with the 
      Fragile X syndrome with FMR1 premutation is the cause of the lower FMRP levels 
      that leads to the clinical involvement.

TI  - Molecular understanding of aluminum-induced topological changes in (CCG)12 
      triplet repeats: relevance to neurological disorders.
PG  - 56-64
AB  - Recent studies have shown that gene mutations are involved in the pathology of 
      neurological disorders. CCG repeats cause genetic instability and are localized 
      at the 5' end of the non-coding regions of the FMR1 gene in fragile X syndrome. 
      Our studies for the first time showed that aluminum (Al) levels were elevated in 
      the serum samples of fragile X syndrome and also provide evidence for the 
      interaction of aluminum with (CCG)12-repeats. Circular dichroism spectroscopic 
      studies of (CCG)12 indicated B-DNA conformation and in the presence of Al (10(-5) 
      M) CCG repeats attained Z-DNA conformation. Further spectroscopic studies, which 
      included melting profiles, ethidium bromide binding patterns and interaction of 
      Z-DNA specific polyclonal antibodies confirmed the Z-conformation in 
      (CCG)12-repeats in the presence of Al (10(-5) M). It is interesting to mention 
      that Al-induced Z-conformation is stable even after the total removal of Al from 
      CCG by desferoximine, a chelating drug. This is the first report to proof the 
      role of Al in modulating the DNA (CCG repeats) topology and this information 
      provides a clue about the possible involvement of Al at a molecular level in 
      neurological/neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - Histone modifications depict an aberrantly heterochromatinized FMR1 gene in 
      fragile x syndrome.
PG  - 923-32
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is caused by an expansion of a polymorphic CGG triplet repeat 
      that results in silencing of FMR1 expression. This expansion triggers methylation 
      of FMR1's CpG island, hypoacetylation of associated histones, and chromatin 
      condensation, all characteristics of a transcriptionally inactive gene. Here, we 
      show that there is a graded spectrum of histone H4 acetylation that is 
      proportional to CGG repeat length and that correlates with responsiveness of the 
      gene to DNA demethylation but not with chromatin condensation. We also identify 
      alterations in patient cells of two recently identified histone H3 modifications: 
      methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 and methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9, 
      which are marks for euchromatin and heterochromatin, respectively. In fragile X 
      cells, there is a decrease in methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 with a large 
      increase in methylation at lysine 9, a change that is consistent with the model 
      of FMR1's switch from euchromatin to heterochromatin in the disease state. The 
      high level of histone H3 methylation at lysine 9 may account for the failure of 
      H3 to be acetylated after treatment of fragile X cells with inhibitors of histone 
      deacetylases, a treatment that fully restores acetylation to histone H4. Using 
      5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, we show that DNA methylation is tightly coupled to the 
      histone modifications associated with euchromatin but not to the heterochromatic 
      mark of methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9, consistent with recent findings 
      that this histone modification may direct DNA methylation. Despite the 
      drug-induced accumulation of mRNA in patient cells to 35% of the wild-type level, 
      FMR1 protein remained undetectable. The identification of intermediates in the 
      heterochromatinization of FMR1 has enabled us to begin to dissect the epigenetics 
      of silencing of a disease-related gene in its natural chromosomal context.

      transgenic mice. We generated transgenic lines that show a dramatic increase from 
      26 to >300 repeats in three generations. One of the salient features of our 
      transgene is the inclusion of the origin of replication of simian virus-40 
      (SV40), which is known to exclude nucleosomes. Three founder mice in FVB/NJ 
      background show expansion of CGG repeats present in the transgene, supporting a 
      postzygotic mechanism for CGG expansion that is independent of a genomic 
      imprinting effect. We discuss here the results of analyzing one of the lines 
      established.

TI  - Low frequency of MECP2 mutations in mentally retarded males.
PG  - 487-90
AB  - A high frequency of mutations in the methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene 
      has recently been reported in males with nonspecific X-linked mental retardation. 
      The results of this previous study suggested that the frequency of MECP2 
      mutations in the mentally retarded population was comparable to that of CGG 
      expansions in FMR1. In view of these data, we performed MECP2 mutation analysis 
      in a cohort of 475 mentally retarded males who were negative for FMR1 CGG repeat 
      expansion. Five novel changes, detected in seven patients, were predicted to 
      change the MECP2 coding sequence. Except for one, these changes were not found in 
      a control population. While this result appeared to suggest a high mutation rate, 
      this conclusion was not supported by segregation studies. Indeed, three of the 
      five changes could be traced in unaffected male family members. For another 
      change, segregation analysis in the family was not possible. Only one mutation, a 
      frameshift created by a deletion of two bases, was found to be de novo. This 
      study clearly shows the importance of segregation analysis for low frequency 
      mutations, in order to distinguish them from rare polymorphisms. The true 
      frequency of MECP2 mutations in the mentally retarded has probably been 
      overestimated. Based on our data, the frequency of MECP2 mutations in mentally 
      retarded males is 0.2% (1/475).

TI  - Cognitive and behavioral performance among FMR1 high-repeat allele carriers 
      surveyed from special education classes.
PG  - 458-65
AB  - The fragile X syndrome is caused by an unstable CGG repeat sequence in the 5' 
      untranslated region of the X-linked, FMR1 gene. When the number of repeats 
      exceeds 200, the region is hypermethylated and the gene is silenced. The lack of 
      the protein produced by the FMR1 gene, FMRP, causes the fragile X syndrome. 
      Recent evidence suggests that FMR1 alleles with unmethylated long repeat tracks 
      (40-200 repeats) may cause a specific somatic phenotype in women, premature 
      ovarian failure, and may cause variation in the levels of FMR1 mRNA and FMRP. 
      Because FMR1 is known to be involved in the regulation of subset of genes 
      expressed in the brain, we investigated the variation in cognitive and/or 
      behavioral performance among carriers of high repeat alleles. Specifically, we 
      administered cognitive, behavioral, and adaptive performance tests to children 
      identified with high repeat alleles who attended special education classes in 
      Atlanta, Georgia public schools and to those with < 40 repeats drawn from the 
      same population. Overall, we found no significant effect of repeat size and the 
      psychometric measures in our test battery after adjustment for multiple 
      comparisons. All scales were found to be within 1 SD standard deviation of the 
      mean. We did find an intriguing, albeit marginally statistically significant, 
      association in the cognitive profile among males and not females, consistent with 
      an X-linked effect. After adjusting for the overall cognitive abilities score, 
      Verbal Ability scores decreased and Nonverbal Reasoning scores increased with 
      repeat number to a greater extent in males than females. Spatial Ability scores 
      were not associated with repeat number.

TI  - DNA damage and repair in lymphoblastoid cell lines from normal donors and fragile 
      X syndrome patients.
PG  - 128-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because lymphocytes from fragile X patients have been reported as 
      hypersensitive to bleomycin-induced chromatid breaks and because the number of 
      trinucleotide repeats in families with fragile X syndrome has a propensity to 
      expand, we have investigated the possibility that fragile X cells may be 
      hypersensitive to DNA damage and have a lower capacity for DNA repair. METHODS: 
      Lymphocytes from normal and fragile X syndrome donors were immortalized by 
      Epstein-Barr virus transformation. Characteristics of fragile X syndrome 
      including the folate-sensitive fragile site on chromosome Xq27.3, length of CGG 
      repeat expansion, and FMRP expression in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed 
      lymphoblastoid cell lines were analyzed by standard cytogenetic methods, Southern 
      blot, and Western blot, respectively. Analysis of DNA damage and repair induced 
      by hydrogen peroxide, bleomycin, ethyl methanesulfonate, 
      4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide, etoposide, and mitomycin C was carried out by 
      single-cell gel electrophoresis assay (known as comet assay). RESULTS: 
      Lymphoblastoid cell lines from fragile X donors had a folate-sensitive fragile 
      site on chromosome Xq27.3, no or low FMRP expression, and expansion of the CGG 
      repeat. Results of comet assay showed that fragile X cells were not more 
      sensitive to mutagen-induced DNA strand breaks and did not have lower DNA repair 
      capacity in comparison with normal cells. Furthermore, one fragile X cell line 
      showed hyposensitivity to DNA strand breaks induced by hydrogen peroxide, 
      bleomycin, and ethyl methansulfonate. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study do 
      not support the notion that CGG trinucleotide expansion in fragile X syndrome is 
      caused by permanent deficiency in DNA repair.

TI  - Is the 31 CAG repeat allele of the spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) gene locus 
      non-specifically associated with trinucleotide expansion diseases?
PG  - 201-5
AB  - A number of human hereditary neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders are 
      caused by the expansion of trinucleotide repeats within certain genes. The 
      molecular mechanisms that underlie these expansions are not yet known. We have 
      analyzed six trinucleotide repeat-containing loci [spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, 
      SCA3, SCA8), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), Huntington chorea (HD) 
      and fragile X syndrome (FRAXA)] in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients (n = 
      52). As controls, we analyzed two groups of subjects: healthy control subjects (n 
      =133), and a group of patients with non-triplet neuromuscular diseases (n = 68) 
      caused by point mutations, deletions or duplications (spinal muscular atrophy, 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 1A, hereditary neuropathy with liability to 
      pressure palsies, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy). Allele frequency 
      distributions for all tested loci were similar in these three groups with the 
      exception of the SCA1 locus. In DM1 patients, the SCA1 allele with 31 CAG repeats 
      account for 40.4% of all chromosomes tested, which is significantly higher than 
      in two other groups (11.3% in healthy controls and 6.6% in the group of 
      non-triplet diseased patients; P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). This is 
      consistent with our previous findings in HD patients. The absence of this 
      association in non-triplet diseases as well as in healthy controls could indicate 
      a possible role of this SCA1 allele with 31 repeats in triplet diseases. Here we 
      discuss a possible role of the SCA1 region in pathological trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions.

TI  - Evaluation of the fragile X (FRAXA) syndrome with methylation-sensitive PCR.
PG  - 450-8
AB  - The fragile X (FRAXA) syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental 
      retardation in males. Its peculiar pattern of inheritance results from the parent 
      of origin-specific expansion of a CGG-repeat within the FMR1 gene on the X 
      chromosome. In patients, gene function is abolished by hypermethylation of the 
      promoter and the massively expanded repeat. We have developed a 
      methylation-sensitive polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR) strategy that combines 
      repeat-length and methylation analysis of the CGG-repeat and the promoters of the 
      FMR1 and XIST genes. The allelic methylation of the latter opposes that of the 
      FMR promoter and serves as an internal control and standard for semiquantitative 
      analyses. This system enables the delineation of 11 distinct patterns encountered 
      in nonaffected, carrier, and affected males and females. We have evaluated our 
      system on well-defined samples with different FMR1 mutations and have used it for 
      the diagnostic evaluation of 253 male and 80 female probands. In the male group, 
      we have identified five full mutations, and three gray-zone and premutation 
      alleles with 54, 55, and 62 repeats, respectively. The female group consists of 
      33 normal homozygote and 41 heterozygote individuals, two of whom harbor a 
      gray-zone allele with 47 repeats, none with a premutation, and six with a full 
      mutation. Our MS-PCR approach allows the currently most comprehensive diagnostic

TI  - Instability of a (CGG)98 repeat in the Fmr1 promoter.
PG  - 1693-9
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is one of 14 trinucleotide repeat diseases. It arises due to 
      expansion of a CGG repeat which is present in the 5'-untranslated region of the 
      FMR1 gene, disruption of which leads to mental retardation. The mechanisms 
      involved in trinucleotide repeat expansion are poorly understood and to date, 
      transgenic mouse models containing transgenic expanded CGG repeats have failed to 
      reproduce the instability seen in humans. As both cis-acting factors and the 
      genomic context of the CGG repeat are thought to play a role in expansion, we 
      have now generated a knock-in mouse Fmr1 gene in which the murine (CGG)8 repeat 
      has been exchanged with a human (CGG)98 repeat. Unlike other CGG transgenic 
      models, this model shows moderate CGG repeat instability upon both in maternal 
      and paternal transmission. This model will now enable us to study the timing and 
      the mechanism of repeat expansion in mice.

TI  - Molecular screening for fragile X syndrome in mentally handicapped children in 
      Korea.
PG  - 271-5
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is one of the most common forms of inherited mental 
      retardation and is caused by the expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeats in 
      the FMR-1 gene. This study was aimed to facilitate the molecular screening of 
      fragile X syndrome in Korean children with mental retardation of unknown 
      etiology. The subjects were tested by Expand Long Template PCR system in the 
      presence of 7-deaza-dGTP, and then by Southern blot analysis. The PCR method 
      provided rapid and reliable results for the identification of fragile X negative 
      and positive patients. One hundred one mentally retarded children (78 males and 
      23 females) were screened by PCR amplification, which detected only one abnormal 
      sample. The PCR-positive case was confirmed by the CGG repeat expansion on 
      Southern blot analysis with a positive cytogenetic result. In conclusion, Expand 
      Long Template PCR may be used as the first screening test for detecting the 
      fragile X syndrome.

TI  - Implications of the FMR1 gene in menopause: study of 147 Spanish women.
PG  - 106-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between the FMR1 premutation and 
      premature ovarian failure (POF) in the Spanish population and the possible 
      incorporation of this test in gynecological procedures for women with POF or 
      early menopause (EM). DESIGN: Clinical and molecular genetic study. Ninety-eight 
      premutated and six full-mutated carriers of fragile X syndrome and 43 women with 
      POF were studied by polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis for the 
      CGG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene. RESULTS: Among premutated carriers, 12.2% 
      (12 of 98) presented with POF, and 15.3% (15 of 98) presented with EM. Neither 
      POF nor EM was observed in any of the six full-mutated women. Two women of 43 
      from the POF population (4.65%) were carriers for the CGG premutation in the FMR1 
      gene. No correlation between CGG expansion size and age at menopause was found. A 
      biased paternal origin of the premutation and a high twinning incidence was found 
      in all premutated women, whether they had POF or not. CONCLUSIONS: Our data 
      support the hypothesis that the FMR1 gene is one of the genes associated with POF 
      and EM. Analysis of the CGG expansion in the FMR1 gene may be justified in women 
      with POF and EM until the real role of the FMR1 premutation is determined.

TI  - Novel polymorphism in the FMR1 gene resulting in a "pseudodeletion" of FMR1 in a 
      commonly used fragile X assay.
PG  - 128-31
AB  - The fragile X syndrome is the most commonly inherited cause of mental 
      retardation. Genetic diagnosis of this disease relies on the detection of triplet 
      repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. Although the majority of 
      disease in fragile X patients is due to mutations involving triplet repeat 
      expansion, deletion of various portions of FMR1 has also been described in 
      association with the fragile X syndrome. Here we describe a rare polymorphism in 
      the noncoding region of FMR1 that mimics detection of a deletion in a commonly 
      used assay for fragile X syndrome, which can result in misdiagnosis of the 
      disease.

TI  - The risk of fragile X premutation expansion is lower in carriers detected by 
      general prenatal screening than in carriers from known fragile X families.
PG  - 289-92
AB  - The Fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of inherited mental retardation. 
      For a female premutation carrier, the risk of having a child with a full mutation 
      is positively correlated with the size of the premutation. The current study was 
      performed to evaluate the risk of premutation expansion in the offspring of 
      average-risk carriers detected by general prenatal screening. Over a 4-year 
      period, 9,660 women underwent DNA screening for FMR1 mutation/premutation at the 
      Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. A premutation was defined as a CGG repeat 
      number >50 in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of exon 1 in the FMR1 gene. The 
      study included only individuals with no family history of X-linked mental 
      retardation or known FMR1 mutations. A premutation was found in 85 women (1 in 
      114), 68 of whom consented to have prenatal diagnoses in 74 pregnancies. The 
      abnormal allele was transmitted to the offspring in 44 pregnancies. Of these, no 
      change in allele size was noted in 35 pregnancies (79.6%), and expansion within 
      premutation range was evident in 4 pregnancies (9%). In 5 pregnancies (11.4%), 
      expansion to the full mutation was noted. This occurred only in carriers having 
      more than 90 repeats. We conclude that the likelihood of Fragile X premutation 
      expansion to full mutation is significantly lower in individuals ascertained by 
      general prenatal carrier testing than in those from known Fragile X families.

TI  - Apparently unstable normal FMR1 alleles in nine developmentally delayed patients: 
      implications for molecular diagnosis of the fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 235-9
AB  - The Fragile X syndrome is a common form of X-linked mental retardation, affecting 
      approximately 1 in 4,000 males. Since the discovery of the FMR1 gene responsible 
      for the syndrome, molecular, rather than cytogenetic, diagnosis of Fragile X 
      syndrome has become the gold standard. Numerous molecular diagnostic centers 
      worldwide use PCR and Southern blotting to characterize the size of the CGG 
      repeats within the gene, expansion of which has been shown to be associated with 
      the vast majority of cases of Fragile X syndrome. Instability of this repeat 
      through successive generations has been demonstrated in many patients and has 
      been associated with numerous factors, including repeat length and molecular 
      structure of the repeat. Nine males with normal-size alleles that exhibit repeat 
      length instability by the presence of a second normal length distinct band by 
      repeated PCR analysis from peripheral lymphocytes are reported. Many hypotheses 
      addressing the reason for this apparent instability were tested without 
      elucidating the underlying molecular causes, including cytogenetic analysis, 
      sequence analysis of the repeat locus, and analysis of flanking dinucleotide 
      repeat loci. All patients exhibited a normal complement of sex chromosomes by 
      cytogenetic and molecular analysis. These results from the widely used PCR 
      analysis illustrate an interesting molecular phenomenon and raise many questions 
      relating to the factors and mechanisms involved in trinucleotide instability as 
      well as having implications for the diagnostic testing of the Fragile X syndrome.

      mild/moderate mental retardation, with/without family history, and the fragile X 
      clinical phenotype. Screening by Southern hybridization revealed an overall 
      frequency of 0.077 of the syndrome in the sample population. The disorder was 
      observed with a high frequency (0.1) among males as compared to females (0.027). 
      No expansions of FMR2 allele were observed in the same study sample. CGG/GCC 
      allelic polymorphism of FMR1 and FMR2 were established from a total of 392 X 
      chromosomes, using the radioactive polymerase chain reaction-polyacrylamide gel 
      electrophoresis method. Distinct repeat sizes, repeat ranges, and repeat modes 
      characterised the FMR1 and FMR2 alleles. In the X chromosomes of both MR 
      individuals and unaffected controls, unimodal values of 29 and 15 repeats in FMR1 
      and FMR2 genes, respectively, were observed. Allele frequency distribution was 
      symmetrical at the FMR1 locus whereas a significant positive skew was observed 
      for the FMR2 alleles. The observed heterozygosity of the FMR1 gene was 0.772 
      compared to 0.839 of FMR2. Correlation of CGG/GCC repeats of FMR1 and FMR2 did 
      not show any association of repeat sizes at these two loci (correlation 
      coefficient, rho = 0.09). CGG/GCC repeat variation at FMR1 and FMR2 loci observed 
      in this study sample are different from that reported for the other Caucasian and 
      Asian populations.

AB  - The number of trinucleotide CGG repeats at the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 
      gene is associated with the fragile X syndrome of mental retardation. We screened 
      for the CGG repeat length in the FMR1 gene of the X-chromosomes from unrelated 
      normal Chinese subjects recruited in Hong Kong and Dalian, a southern and a 
      northern Chinese city respectively. These cities are about 3000 km apart and the 
      residents have few historical interactions. Genomic DNA was analysed by PCR and 
      detected by Southern hybridisation with a radiolabelled (CGG)5 probe for the CGG 
      repeat number. A different distribution pattern of CGG allele size from the 
      Caucasians is observed. It is a bimodal pattern with the most common CGG repeats 
      allele at 29 against 30 in the Caucasians. Among the Hong Kong subjects, five 
      alleles of more than 50 CGG repeats were detected, and four of those were in 
      heterozygous females. There was no difference in the repeat patterns in subjects 
      from the two cities, suggesting no genotypic variation in FMR1 between northern 
      and southern Chinese.

TI  - Increase of FMRP expression, raised levels of FMR1 mRNA, and clonal selection in 
      proliferating cells with unmethylated fragile X repeat expansions: a clue to the 
      sex bias in the transmission of full mutations?
PG  - 842-50
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is a triplet repeat disorder caused by expansions of a CGG 
      repeat in the fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR1) to more than 220 triplets 
      (full mutation) that usually coincide with hypermethylation and transcriptional 
      silencing. The disease phenotype results from deficiency or loss of FMR1 protein 
      (FMRP) and occurs in both sexes. The underlying full mutations arise exclusively 
      on transmission from a mother who carries a premutation allele (60-200 CGGs). 
      While the absolute requirement of female transmission could result from different 
      mechanisms, current evidence favours selection or contraction processes acting at 
      gametogenesis of pre- and full mutation males. To address these questions 
      experimentally, we used a model system of cultured fibroblasts from a male who 
      presented heterogeneous unmethylated expansions in the pre- and full mutation 
      size range. On continual cell proliferation to 30 doublings we re-examined the 
      behaviour of the expanded repeats on Southern blots and also determined the 
      expression of the FMR1 gene by FMRP immunocytochemistry, western analysis, and 
      RT-PCR. With increasing population doublings, expansion patterns changed and 
      showed accumulation of shorter alleles. The FMRP levels were below normal but 
      increased continuously while the cells that were immunoreactive for FMRP 
      accumulated. The level of FMR1 mRNA was raised with even higher levels of mRNA 
      measured at higher passages. Current results support the theory of a selection 
      advantage of FMRP positive over FMRP deficient cells. During extensive 
      proliferation of spermatogonia in fragile X males, this selection mechanism would 
      eventually replace all full mutations by shorter alleles allowing more efficient 
      FMRP translation. At the proliferation of oogonia of carrier females, the same 
      mechanism would, in theory, favour transmission of any expanded FMR1 allele on 
      inactive X chromosomes.

TI  - Identification of small FRAXA premutations.
PG  - 221-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of fragile X syndrome in mentally retarded individuals is 
      satisfactorily achieved using a Southern blot test that detects the typical 
      triplet repeat expansion (>200 repeats) within the FMR1 gene. All such 
      individuals inherit the mutation from a carrier, who usually shows a lower 
      triplet repeat number and may be asymptomatic. Having identified a fragile X 
      proband, it is necessary to identify related carriers of this familial X-linked 
      dominant mutation to provide family counseling and testing. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      For one family in which a fragile XA repeat expansion occurs, Southern blot 
      hybridization did not give accurate sizing data because of the very small 
      premutation associated with the unstable allele. PCR sizing methods and linkage 
      analysis were adapted to identify family members with the premutation. 
      CONCLUSION: Although most carriers can be detected using Southern blot and/or 
      direct PCR sizing tests, very small expansions (55-70 repeats) are difficult to 
      distinguish from larger, normal alleles. We have used linkage analysis in 
      combination with direct allele analysis to identify carriers of very small 
      expansions of a fragile X chromosome in a four-generation family.

TI  - Prenatal diagnosis of fragile X syndrome and the risk of expansion of a

PG  - 111-5
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate prospectively the dynamics of the 
      FMR1 gene. The risk of full mutation among pregnant women and the carriers, and 
      the risk of expansion of a premutation allele to a full mutation were estimated. 
      We identified 89 pregnant women with an expanded FMR1 gene seeking prenatal 
      diagnosis. Amniocentesis or chorion villus sampling (CVS) was offered and a DNA 
      test of the FMR1 gene was carried out in such pregnancies. The overall risk of 
      full mutation among women (N = 21) with a repeat size between 60 and 80 was 4.8% 
      (one fetus with mosaicism), and the risk of expansion of the premutation allele 
      to a full mutation was 14% in those offspring to whom the premutation allele was 
      transmitted. The risk of full mutation among the carriers (N = 13) with a repeat 
      size between 81 and 100 was 61.5% (8/13), and the risk of expansion of a 
      premutation allele to a full mutation was 89%. Only one case fell into the 
      category of 101-200 repeats, and expansion to a full mutation was recorded. 
      Fetuses of full mutation mothers inherited the larger allele in 64% (14/22) of 
      the cases. The range of 40-59 repeats was safe: there were no fetal full 
      mutations. The risk of full mutation was also low among the subjects with a 
      repeat size between 60 and 80, whereas the risk increased significantly after 80 
      repeats. Maternal premutation size was positively correlated with the risk of 
      having a full mutation offspring.

TI  - Fragile X males with unmethylated, full mutation trinucleotide repeat expansions 
      have elevated levels of FMR1 messenger RNA.
PG  - 232-6
AB  - Fragile X syndrome normally arises as a consequence of large expansions (n >200) 
      of a (CGG)(n) trinucleotide repeat in the promoter region of the FMR1 gene. The 
      clinical phenotype is thought to result from hypermethylation of the repeat and 
      adjacent upstream elements, with consequent down-regulation of transcription 
      (transcriptional silencing). However, the relationship between repeat expansion 
      and transcription has not been defined in the full mutation range. Using the 
      method of quantitative (fluorescence) reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 
      reaction, we demonstrated previously that FMR1 mRNA levels are substantially 
      elevated in premutation (55 </= n < 200) male carriers. In the current work, we 
      report that in fragile X males with unmethylated alleles in the full mutation 
      range (n > 200), FMR1 mRNA levels remain significantly elevated (mean 3.5-fold 
      elevation; P = 6.7 x 10(-3)) relative to normal controls, even for alleles 
      exceeding 300 repeats. This conclusion is independent of any assumption regarding 
      the transcriptional activity of methylated alleles. However, if it were assumed 
      that all methylated alleles were transcriptionally silent, the FMR1 mRNA levels 
      for cells with unmethylated alleles would be even higher (mean 4.5-fold 
      elevation; P = 2.1 x 10(-4)). These observations show that the full-mutation CGG 
      expansion per se is not a strong impediment to transcription and that the 
      apparent up-regulation of the FMR1 locus remains active in at least some cells 
      with full-mutation alleles.

TI  - Rapid FMR1-protein analysis of fetal blood: an enhancement of prenatal

PG  - 258-60
AB  - Fragile-X syndrome, a frequent cause of inherited mental retardation, is 
      characterised in almost all cases by a CGG-repeat expansion that is located 
      within the FMR-1 gene and that prevents the expression of fragile-X mental 
      retardation protein (FMRP). We describe a test that simultaneously allows the 
      rapid detection of FMRP in fetal lymphocytes and distinguishes these from fetal 
      erythrocytes. Routine molecular genetic methods fail in the rare cases where 
      protein expression is blocked, although there is no repeat expansion. 
      Furthermore, they are unsuitable in cases of advanced pregnancy. Our test proves 
      extremely valuable under both these circumstances.

TI  - A first molecular approach towards CGG repeat expansion in FMR1 gene in systemic 
      lupus erythematosus and in Sjogren's syndrome: a preliminary report.
PG  - 262-4
AB  - Co-occurrent autoimmune disease and fragile X syndrome has been reported in the 
      literature and we have therefore studied the expansion of 
      Cytosine-Guanine-Guanine (CGG) repeat in FMR1 gene in a series of females with 
      autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome, 
      with PCR and Southern blot methods. The average length of trinucleotide repeat 
      was not increased in these female patients as compared with controls. These 
      preliminary data on a short series of patients suggest a possible absence of 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion abnormality associated with autoimmune diseases 
      such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome.

TI  - Fragile X CGG repeat structures among African-Americans: identification of a 
      novel factor responsible for repeat instability.
PG  - 1759-69
AB  - The cryptic CGG repeat responsible for the fragile X syndrome, located in the 
      5'-UTR of FMR1, is unique compared with the many other triplet repeat-causing 
      diseases, making it ideal for identifying factors involved in repeat expansion 
      that may be common to other triplet repeat diseases. To date, a number of factors 
      have been identified which may influence repeat instability, including the number 
      and position of interspersed AGGs, length of the 3' pure CGG repeat and haplotype 
      background. However, nearly all such data were derived from studies of 
      Caucasians. Using a large African-American population, we present the only 
      comprehensive examination of factors associated with CGG repeat instability in a 
      non-Caucasian population. Among Caucasians, susceptible alleles were thought to 
      come from those in the intermediate repeat range (41-60 repeats); however, we 
      find that susceptible alleles may come from a larger repeat pool (35-60 repeats) 
      and are better defined by their pure CGG repeat and/or -presence of only one AGG 
      interruption. These results demonstrate the existence of different susceptible 
      alleles among world populations and may account for the similar prevalence of the 
      fragile X syndrome in African-Americans compared with Caucasians despite the 
      lower frequency of inter-mediate sized alleles in the African-American 
      population. Finally, we show that repeat structures among unaffected 
      African-Americans with the most frequent fragile X haplotype background are 
      either pure or contain a single distal interruption. We propose that the lack of 
      a proximal most interruption is a novel factor involved in CGG repeat 
      instability.

TI  - Molecular diagnosis of fragile X syndrome and distribution of CGG repeats in the 
      FMR-1 gene in Taiwanese.
PG  - 402-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fragile X syndrome, the most frequent form of inherited 
      mental retardation, is caused by abnormal expansion of the CGG trinucleotide 
      repeats in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR-1 gene. In this study, we 
      describe the prenatal diagnosis of fragile X syndrome and the distribution of CGG 
      repeat numbers in the FMR-1 gene, which has not been previously reported in 
      Taiwanese. METHODS: Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we determined the 
      range of the CGG repeats in the FMR-1 gene in 316 normal individuals (350 X 
      chromosomes) and 349 mentally retarded patients (429 X chromosomes). For prenatal 
      diagnosis of fragile X syndrome, DNA extracted from amniotic fluid cells was used 
      for PCR determination of CGG repeats. RESULTS: Because there were no significant 
      differences between the distribution of the (CGG)n alleles between the mentally 
      retarded and normal subjects, the data were pooled. Among the 779 X chromosomes 
      studied, 24 different alleles were identified with a low of 16 and a high of 45 
      CGG repeats. The 29 repeat allele was the most common, followed by the 30 and the 
      28 repeat alleles. We effectively amplified slightly expanded premutation alleles 
      of up to about 90 CGG repeats. In the prenatally diagnosed fetus, a normal 29 
      repeat allele was found. CONCLUSIONS: Determination of the distribution of the 
      CGG repeats in the FMR-1 gene in Taiwanese is useful in genetic counseling 
      regarding fragile X syndrome. Prenatal molecular diagnosis of the syndrome can be 
      successfully performed using amniotic fluid cells.

TI  - Characterization of trinucleotide- and tandem repeat-containing transcripts 
      obtained from human spinal cord cDNA library by high-density filter 
      hybridization.
PG  - 265-73
AB  - In order to identify trinucleotide- and tandem repeat-containing transcripts in 
      human spinal cord, hybridization of a high-density spinal cord cDNA library 
      filter was carried out using a radioactively labeled degenerate oligonucleotide 
      designed to detect different trinucleotide repeats including those known to occur 
      in disease-associated expansions, in a single step. The sequence analysis of the 
      trinucleotide repeat-containing transcripts (TNRTs) revealed 23 known mammalian 
      genes with trinucleotide repeat-containing regions (TNRs), some of which were not 
      previously reported to contain TNRs, and 18 cDNA clones with no or insignificant 
      sequence homology to known genes. Amongst the known genes detected was the 
      fragile X gene (FMR-1) containing (CGG)30. Other genes containing extended TNRs 
      of 9 to 21 repeats were calcium-dependent protease, ATBF1-A, ferritin H chain, 
      and the G protein Gsalpha2. Ten sequences containing perfect TNRs and two 
      sequences containing perfect tandem repeats (derived from 11 TNRTs) were further 
      analyzed for allelic variation using primers flanking the TNR, and five were 
      shown to exhibit two to five alleles per TNR. These transcripts were further 
      investigated for their chromosomal localization where unknown or only partially 
      characterized. The transcripts that were polymorphic in the TNR region were 
      ATBF1-A (a homeodomain protein), clone 390013 on chromosome Xp11, a member of the 
      family of the 14.3.3 protein kinase C regulators, a human translation initiation 
      factor (an isolog of the yeast Suilisol gene 1), and a novel sequence (TR21). 
      Only the first two transcripts showed the presence of rare expanded alleles. 
      Characterization of polymorphic TNRs in novel and even known genes expressed in 
      human spinal cord is likely to help in the identification of new candidates for 
      genes involved in neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - FRAXE mutation in a mentally retarded subject and in his phenotypically normal 
      twin brother.
PG  - 157-62
AB  - The FRAXE fragile site, 600 kb distal to the more common FRAXA, has been reported 
      to be expressed in subjects with mild non-syndromal mental retardation (MR). 
      Amplification of more than 200 GCC repeats, associated with methylation of the 
      adjacent CpG island at Xq28, leads to the expression of the fragile site. In 1996 
      a large gene, FMR2, transcribed distally from the CpG island and downregulated by 
      repeat expansion and methylation, was identified. Among 232 mentally retarded 
      patients, tested FRAXA negative, we identified an Italian family segregating a 
      hypermethylated expansion at the FRAXE locus in two dizygotic twin brothers, 
      their sister and their mother. The index case was referred at 23 years of age 
      with severe MR, epilepsy, a dysmorphic face with a high arched palate, marfanoid 
      habitus and hyperreflexia of the lower limbs. His brother was referred to as 
      normal and psychometric tests confirmed he is not mentally retarded. All members 
      of the family underwent FRAXE molecular analysis, after cytogenetic expression of 
      the fraX site and negative FRAXA test. Interestingly, an expansion and a 
      hypermethylation at the FRAXE locus were found in all of them. Fibroblasts from 
      the clinically normal brother were assayed for FMR2 expression and the 
      transcription of the gene was found to be silenced. The presence of a 
      phenotypically normal male with absent FMR2 expression in fibroblasts suggests 
      that the relationship between the FRAXE mutation, FMR2 expression and MR needs to 
      be further investigated.

TI  - Methylation mosaicism of 5'-(CGG)(n)-3' repeats in fragile X, premutation and 
      normal individuals.
PG  - 2141-52
AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FRAXA) is characterized at the molecular level by an 
      expansion of a naturally occurring 5'-(CGG)(n)-3' repeat in the promoter and 
      5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene 
      on human chromosome Xq27.3. When expanded, this region is usually 
      hypermethylated. Inactivation of the FMR1 promoter and absence of the FMR1 
      protein are the likely cause of the syndrome. By using the bisulfite protocol of 
      the genomic sequencing method, we have determined the methylation patterns in 
      this region on single chromosomes of healthy individuals and of selected 
      premutation carriers and FRAXA patients. In control experiments with unmethylated 
      or M- Sss I-premethylated DNAs, this protocol has been ascertained to reliably 
      detect all cytidines or 5-methylcytidines as unmethylated or methylated 
      nucleotides, respectively. Analyses of the DNA from FRAXA patients reveal 
      considerable variability in the lengths of the 5'-(CGG)(n)-3' repeats and in the 
      levels of methylation in the repeat and the 5'-UTR. In one patient (OEl) with 
      high repeat length hetero-geneity ( n = 15 to >200), shorter repeats (n = 20-80) 
      were methylated or unmethylated, longer repeats ( n = 100-150) were often 
      completely methylated, but one repeat with n = 160 proved to be completely 
      unmethylated. This type of methylation mosaicism was observed in several FRAXA 
      patients. In healthy females, methylated 5'-CG-3' sequences were found in some 
      repeats and 5'-UTRs, as expected for the sequences from one of the X chromosomes. 
      The natural FMR1 promoter is methylation sensitive, as demonstrated by the loss 
      of activity in transfection experiments using the unmethylated or M- Sss 
      I-premethylated FMR1 promoter fused to the luciferase gene as an activity 
      indicator.

TI  - Interruption of the fragile X syndrome expanded sequence d(CGG)(n) by 
      interspersed d(AGG) trinucleotides diminishes the formation and stability of 
      d(CGG)(n) tetrahelical structures.
PG  - 1535-41
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is caused by expansion of a d(CGG) trinucleotide repeat 
      sequence in the 5' untranslated region of the first exon of the FMR1 gene. Repeat 
      expansion is thought to be instigated by formation of d(CGG)(n)secondary 
      structures. Stable FMR1 d(CGG)(n)runs in normal individuals consist of 6-52 
      d(CGG) repeats that are interrupted every 9-11 triplets by a single d(AGG) 
      trinucleotide. By contrast, individuals having fragile X syndrome premutation or 
      full mutation present >54-200 or >200-2000 monotonous d(CGG) repeats, 
      respectively. Here we show that the presence of interspersed d(AGG) triplets 
      diminished in vitro formation of bimolecular tetrahelical structures of 
      d(CGG)(18)oligomers. Tetraplex structures formed by d(CGG)(n)oligomers containing 
      d(AGG) interspersions had lower thermal stability. In addition, tetraplex 
      structures of d(CGG)(18)oligomers interspersed by d(AGG) triplets were unwound by 
      human Werner syndrome DNA helicase at rates and to an extent that exceeded the 
      unwinding of tetraplex form consisting of monotonous d(CGG)(18). Diminished 
      formation and stability of tetraplex structures of d(AGG)-containing FMR1 
      d(CGG)(2-50)tracts might restrict their expansion in normal individuals.

TI  - A survey of fragile X syndrome in a sample from Spanish Basque country.
PG  - 197-201
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of mental retardation. The 
      syndrome is associated with a CGG repeat expansion in the 5'UTR of the first exon 
      of the FMR1 gene. This gene maps to Xq27.3 and coincides with the cytogenetic 
      fragile site (FRAXA). The present study deals with the prevalence of fragile X 
      syndrome among individuals with mental retardation of unknown cause from 
      institutions and special schools from the Spanish Basque Country. Results of 
      cytogenetic and molecular studies, performed in a group of 134 unrelated 
      individuals (92 males and 42 females) are presented. The cytogenetic marker at 
      Xq27.3 was identified in 12 patients. Other chromosomal abnormalities were found 
      in two cases that this and previous studies confirmed as Angelman and 
      Prader-Willi syndromes. Two males, in whom the cytogenetic marker was identified, 
      were found negative for FRAXA and FRAXE expansion at the molecular level. The 
      present study shows that the frequency of the FRAXA full mutation in individuals 
      of Spanish non-Basque origin is in the range of other Spanish populations. In the 
      sample of Spanish Basque origin we have not found cytogenetic FRAXA site 
      expression, and the CGG repeat size of FMR1 gene is in the normal range. The 
      significance of these results are discussed.

TI  - Elevated levels of FMR1 mRNA in carrier males: a new mechanism of involvement in 
      the fragile-X syndrome.
PG  - 6-15
AB  - Fragile-X syndrome is a trinucleotide-repeat-expansion disorder in which the 
      clinical phenotype is believed to result from transcriptional silencing of the 
      fragile-X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene as the number of CGG repeats exceeds 
      approximately 200. For premutation alleles ( approximately 55-200 repeats), no 
      abnormalities in FMR1-gene expression have been described, despite growing 
      evidence of clinical involvement in premutation carriers. To address this 
      (apparent) paradox, we have determined, for 16 carrier males (55-192 repeats), 
      the relative levels of leukocyte FMR1 mRNA, by use of automated 
      fluorescence-detection reverse transcriptase-PCR, and the percent of lymphocytes 
      that are immunoreactive for FMR1 protein (FMRP). For some alleles with>100 
      repeats, there was a reduction in the number of FMRP-positive cells. 
      Unexpectedly, FMR1 mRNA levels were elevated at least fivefold within this same 
      range. No significant increase in FMR1 mRNA stability was observed in a 
      lymphoblastoid cell line (160 repeats) derived from one of the carrier males, 
      suggesting that the increased message levels are due to an increased rate of 
      transcription. Current results support a mechanism of involvement in premutation 
      carriers, in which reduced translational efficiency is at least partially 
      compensated through increased transcriptional activity. Thus, diminished 
      translational efficiency may be important throughout much of the premutation 
      range, with a mechanistic switch occurring in the full-mutation range as the FMR1 
      gene is silenced.

TI  - CGG/CCG repeats exhibit orientation-dependent instability and 
      orientation-independent fragility in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 93-100
AB  - An expansion to >200 CGG/CCG repeats (hereafter called CGG) in the 5' region of 
      the FMR1 gene causes fragile X syndrome, and this locus becomes a 
      folate-sensitive fragile site. We used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system 
      to study the stability and fragility of CGG repeats. Tracts of (CGG)(81)and 
      (CGG)(160)were integrated onto a yeast chromosome in both orientations relative 
      to the nearest replication origin. Tracts of this length are pre-mutation alleles 
      in humans, with a high probability of expansion in future generations. The CGG 
      tracts in yeast colonies showed a length-dependent instability with longer tracts 
      being more prone to contraction than shorter tracts. In addition, there was an 
      orientation bias for tract stability with tracts having fewer contractions when 
      the CCG strand was the template for lagging strand synthesis. Expansions of the 
      CGG tracts also occurred in an orientation-dependent manner, although at a lower 
      frequency than contractions. To determine whether CGG tracts are fragile sites in 
      yeast, the CGG tracts were flanked by direct repeats, and the rate of 
      recombination between the repeats determined. Strains carrying the 
      (CGG)(160)tract in either orientation had a large increase in their rate of 
      recombination compared with a no-tract control strain. Because this increase was 
      dependent on genes involved in double-strand break repair, recombination was 
      likely to be initiated by CGG tract-induced breakage between the direct repeats. 
      The observation of orientation-dependent instability and orientation-independent 
      fragility suggests that at least some aspects of their underlying mechanisms are 
      different.

      the complex.
PG  - 7925-32
AB  - The loss of FMR1 expression due to trinucleotide repeat expansion leads to 
      fragile X syndrome, a cause of mental retardation. The encoded protein, FMRP, is 
      a member of a gene family that also contains the fragile X-related proteins, 
      FXR1P and FXR2P. FMRP has been shown to be a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein 
      that selectively binds a subset of mRNAs, forms messenger ribonucleoprotein 
      (mRNP) complexes, and associates with translating ribosomes. Here we describe a 
      cell culture system from which we can isolate epitope-tagged FMRP along with 
      mRNA, including its own message, and at least six other proteins. We identify two 
      of these proteins as FXR1P and FXR2P by using specific antisera and identify a 
      third protein as nucleolin by using mass spectrometry. The presence of nucleolin 
      is confirmed by both reactivity with a specific antiserum as well as reverse 
      coimmunoprecipitation where antinucleolin antiserum immunoprecipitates endogenous 
      FMRP from both cultured cells and mouse brain. The identification of nucleolin, a 
      known component of other mRNPs, adds a new dimension to the analysis of FMRP 
      function, and the approach described should also allow the identification of the 
      remaining unknown proteins of this FMRP-associated mRNP as well as the other 
      bound mRNAs.

TI  - Fully expanded FMR1 CGG repeats exhibit a length- and differentiation-dependent 
      instability in cell hybrids that is independent of DNA methylation.
PG  - 2293-302
AB  - The fragile X syndrome is characterized at the molecular level by expansion and 
      methylation of a CGG trinucleotide repeat located within the FMR1 locus. The 
      tissues of most full mutation carriers are mosaic for repeat size, but these 
      mutational patterns tend to be well conserved when comparing multiple tissues 
      within an individual. Moreover, full mutation alleles are stable in cultured 
      fibroblasts. These observations have been used to suggest that fragile X CGG 
      repeat instability normally is limited to a period during early embryogenesis. 
      DNA methylation of the repeat region is also believed to occur during early 
      development, and some experimental evidence indicates that this modification may 
      stabilize the repeats. To study the behavior of full mutation alleles in mitotic 
      cells, we generated human-mouse somatic cell hybrids that carry both methylated 
      and unmethylated full mutation FMR1 alleles. We observed considerable repeat 
      instability and analyzed repeat dynamics in the hybrids as a function of DNA 
      methylation, repeat length and cellular differentiation. Our results indicate 
      that although DNA methylation does correlate with stability in primary human 
      fibroblasts, it does not do so in the cell hybrids. Instead, repeat stability in 
      the hybrids is dependent on repeat length, except in an undifferentiated cellular 
      background where large alleles are maintained with a high degree of stability. 
      This stability is lost when the cells undergo differentiation. These results 
      indicate that the determinants of CGG repeat stability are more complex than 
      generally believed, and suggest an unexpected role for cellular differentiation 
      in this process.

TI  - Hypomethylation of an expanded FMR1 allele is not associated with a global DNA 
      methylation defect.
PG  - 1375-86
AB  - The vast majority of fragile-X full mutations are heavily methylated throughout 
      the expanded CGG repeat and the surrounding CpG island. Hypermethylation 
      initiates and/or stabilizes transcriptional inactivation of the FMR1 gene, which 
      causes the fragile X-syndrome phenotype characterized, primarily, by mental 
      retardation. The relation between repeat expansion and hypermethylation is not 
      well understood nor is it absolute, as demonstrated by the identification of 
      nonretarded males who carry hypomethylated full mutations. To better characterize 
      the methylation pattern in a patient who carries a hypomethylated full mutation 
      of approximately 60-700 repeats, we have evaluated methylation with the McrBC 
      endonuclease, which allows analysis of numerous sites in the FMR1 CpG island, 
      including those located within the CGG repeat. We report that the expanded-repeat 
      region is completely free of methylation in this full-mutation male. 
      Significantly, this lack of methylation appears to be specific to the expanded 
      FMR1 CGG-repeat region, because various linked and unlinked repetitive-element 
      loci are methylated normally. This finding demonstrates that the lack of 
      methylation in the expanded CGG-repeat region is not associated with a global 
      defect in methylation of highly repeated DNA sequences. We also report that de 
      novo methylation of the expanded CGG-repeat region does not occur when it is 
      moved via microcell-mediated chromosome transfer into a de novo 
      methylation-competent mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line.

TI  - Automated Detection of Trinucleotide Repeats in Fragile X Syndrome.
PG  - 259-269
AB  - Background: The conventional method for diagnosis of fragile X syndrome has been 
      amplification of the trinucleotide repeat region of the FMR-1 gene by polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot analysis to detect full expansion and 
      hypermethylation. "Stuttering" resulting from incomplete amplification is still 
      observed in the PCR products despite the use of reagents that reduce the 
      secondary structure of the GC-rich template. In addition, PCR products can be 
      detected by autoradiography only after 1 to 2 days of exposure. By combination of 
      a recently reported amplification protocol with fluorescence detection of PCR 
      products in an automated DNA sequencer, the PCR protocol for amplification of 
      trinucleotide repeats was simplified. This modified protocol is highly 
      reproducible, more accurate, and less costly than the conventional protocol 
      because of the elimination of radioisotopes from the PCR. Methods and Results: 
      PCRs were conducted with betaine and Pfu DNA polymerase. This improved PCR 
      protocol allowed immediate detection of PCR products in agarose gels containing 
      ethidium bromide. Stuttering was completely eliminated and fragments of up to 1kb 
      ( approximately 250 repeats) were visible in agarose gels. PCR products were 
      automatically detected by laser fluorescence in an automated DNA sequencer by 
      inclusion of a fluorescently-labeled primer in the PCR reaction. A short 
      electrophoresis run of 100 minutes in denaturing acrylamide gels was sufficient 
      to give high resolution of fragments with higher accuracy and sensitivity than 
      conventional detection by autoradiography. Conclusions: A simple, nonradioactive 
      protocol that is more rapid and less expensive than the conventional PCR protocol 
      for the detection of trinucleotide repeats has been developed. By use of this 
      detection protocol, fragment sizes containing up to 100 repeats could be 
      detected, alleles differing by one trinucleotide repeat were clearly resolved, 
      and heterogeneous repeat patterns such as those present in mosaics could be 
      discriminated. This protocol has been adapted to the amplification and detection 
      of at least two other classes of trinucleotide repeats [(CAG)(n) and (CTG)(n)], 
      suggesting that it may be a universal protocol for PCR amplification and 
      detection of trinucleotide repeats.

TI  - A methylation PCR approach for detection of fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 71-9
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is associated with the expansion of the number of CGG 
      trinucleotide tandem repeats at the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. The 
      number of CGG trinucleotide repeats in normal individuals ranges between 5 and 
      50, in asymptomatic carrier individuals it ranges between 50 and 200, and in 
      affected individuals it is more than 200 CGG repeats. In addition, in affected 
      individuals the cytosine residues in the CGG repeats and the adjacent CpG island 
      are methylated and the FMR1 gene is transcriptionally inactive. The most common 
      diagnostic method for the detection of the syndrome is Southern blot analysis. 
      Methods based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) could facilitate the rapid 
      screening of large numbers of individuals by accurately determining the number of 
      CGG repeats. Current PCR techniques for amplification of CGG repeats are, 
      however, inefficient and unreliable because of their 100% C+G composition. Thus, 
      most of the described PCR protocols require subsequent Southern blot analysis and 
      autoradiography. We present a novel PCR approach for the diagnosis of fragile X 
      syndrome based on the methylation-sensitive conversion of C residues to U by 
      bisulfite on single-strand DNA and subsequent amplification of the antisense 
      strand with specific primers. A PCR with primers for methylated C residues will 
      amplify the CpG dinucleotide region upstream to CGG repeats exclusively in 
      affected males. As a result of extensive mismatch between primers and 
      bisulfite-treated DNA, no PCR fragments will be obtained in normal and 
      transmitting males. Moreover, the bisulfite treatment dramatically reduces the 
      C+G component of the region; thus, the high Tm and the strong secondary 
      structures are no longer obstacles for PCR amplification. In normal and carrier 
      individuals, UUG repeats (previously 3'-CCG-5') in the antisense strand can 
      easily be amplified and visualized on a gel by ethidium bromide staining. We 
      applied our method on 25 males previously diagnosed by Southern blot analysis. 
      All the samples were easily and accurately diagnosed. The method has considerable 
      advantages compared with other diagnostic tests for fragile X syndrome.

TI  - Application of capillary nongel sieving electrophoresis for gene analysis.
PG  - 1822-8
AB  - Capillary electrophoresis (CE) has proved to be a strong tool for DNA analysis 
      and has found abundant applications in the fields of restriction fragment sizing, 
      mutation screening, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product characterizing and 
      forensic identifying. CE may be the main alternative to slab gel electrophoresis. 
      Capillary nongel electrophoresis is the most favorable mode when aiming for this 
      purpose because of its advantages of long lifetime, easy operation, good 
      reproducibility, and low expense. In this paper, a new kind of sieving matrix, 
      with mannitol as the additive for capillary electrophoresis, as well as related 
      methods and their application for gene analysis were reported. Nine DNA fragments 
      amplified by multiplex PCR from a normal dystrophin gene were well separated by 
      this system. Three different deletions were found in Duchenne muscular dystrophy 
      (DMD) patients. Three to four copies of the sex-determination region of the Y 
      chromosome (SRY) gene, as well as the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, could 
      be detected in mixed samples. The frequencies of short tandem repeats (STR) in 
      PAH genes was analyzed in 61 normal Chinese individuals and 6 phenylketonuria 
      families. One case of prenatal gene diagnosis was performed. By using this 
      matrix, CE coupled with reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), the analysis of the 
      alternative splicing expression pattern of the fragile X mental retardation 1 
      (FMR1) gene in adult lung tissue was achieved.

TI  - Fragile X syndrome with FMR1 and FMR2 deletion.
PG  - 565-6
AB  - We report a 13 year old boy with fragile X syndrome resulting from a de novo 
      deletion of the FMR1 and FMR2 genes extending from (and including) DXS7536 
      proximally to FMR2 distally. The patient has severe developmental delay, 
      epilepsy, and behavioural difficulties, including autistic features. He has 
      epicanthic folds, in addition to facial features typical of fragile X syndrome, 
      and marked joint hypermobility. We compare our patient to the three other cases 
      reported in which both FMR1 and FMR2 are deleted. This case has the smallest 
      deletion reported to date. All four patients have epilepsy and a more severe 
      degree of mental retardation than is usual in fragile X syndrome resulting from 
      FMR1 triplet repeat expansion. Three of the patients have joint laxity and two 
      have epicanthic folds. We suggest that these features, in particular severe 
      developmental delay and epilepsy, may form part of the characteristic phenotype 
      resulting from deletion of both FMR1 and FMR2 genes. The diagnosis in this case 
      was delayed because routine cytogenetics showed no abnormality and standard 
      molecular tests for FMR1 triplet repeat expansion (PCR and Southern blotting) 
      failed. Further DNA studies should be undertaken to investigate for a deletion 
      where clinical suspicion of fragile X syndrome is strong and routine laboratory 
      tests fail.

TI  - Stability of the human fragile X (CGG)(n) triplet repeat array in Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae deficient in aspects of DNA metabolism.
PG  - 5675-84
AB  - Expanded trinucleotide repeats underlie a growing number of human diseases. The 
      human FMR1 (CGG)(n) array can exhibit genetic instability characterized by 
      progressive expansion over several generations leading to gene silencing and the 
      development of the fragile X syndrome. While expansion is dependent upon the 
      length of uninterrupted (CGG)(n), instability occurs in a limited germ line and 
      early developmental window, suggesting that lineage-specific expression of other 
      factors determines the cellular environment permissive for expansion. To identify 
      these factors, we have established normal- and premutation-length human FMR1 
      (CGG)(n) arrays in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and assessed the frequency 
      of length changes greater than 5 triplets in cells deficient in various DNA 
      repair and replication functions. In contrast to previous studies with 
      Escherichia coli, we observed a low frequency of orientation-dependent large 
      expansions in arrays carrying long uninterrupted (CGG)(n) arrays in a wild-type 
      background. This frequency was unaffected by deletion of several DNA mismatch 
      repair genes or deletion of the EXO1 and DIN7 genes and was not enhanced through 
      meiosis in a wild-type background. Array contraction occurred in an 
      orientation-dependent manner in most mutant backgrounds, but loss of the Sgs1p 
      resulted in a generalized increase in array stability in both orientations. In 
      contrast, FMR1 arrays had a 10-fold-elevated frequency of expansion in a rad27 
      background, providing evidence for a role in lagging-strand Okazaki fragment 
      processing in (CGG)(n) triplet repeat expansion.

TI  - Improved fluorescent PCR-based assay for sizing CGG repeats at the FRAXA locus.
PG  - 397-402
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most frequent heritable genetic disease involving 
      mental retardation and is usually caused by an expanded CGG repeat in the first 
      exon of the FMR1 gene. Therefore, searching for CGG expansion at the FRAXA locus 
      among the mentally retarded has become a routine investigation in 
      neuro-paediatric practice. Consequently, we have developed a fluorescent 
      PCR-based assay for sizing repeats as an alternative to laborious and 
      time-consuming Southern blot. The procedure utilises a reverse fluorescent 
      labelled primer, and the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche) with addition of 
      dimethylsulfoxide and 7-deaza-dGTP It allows precise determination of the CGG 
      repeat number in males and females for alleles from normal to premutation size 
      range and detection of full mutations in males. We believe that this PCR 
      protocol, allowing a high sample throughput, is useful for first-line screening 
      among mentally retarded males, possibly complemented by Southern blot analysis to 
      assess the methylation status of large mutated alleles.

TI  - Postmortem examination of two fragile X brothers with an FMR1 full mutation.
PG  - 245-9
AB  - Large expansions of the CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene 
      are found in patients with the fragile X syndrome. Amplified CGG repeats in FMR1 
      are unstable and show intergenerational increase from mother to offspring. The 
      exact timing of repeat amplification, however, is unknown. We have compared the 
      extent of CGG expansion in various tissues of this deceased fragile X patient, 
      and found only limited variation in repeat expansion. The repeat was fully 
      methylated in all tissues examined. Therefore, no evidence for extensive mitotic 
      expansion of the CGG repeat during fetal or postnatal life of a fragile X patient 
      was found, in contrast to dynamic mutations caused by CAG/CTG repeat expansion. 
      Extensive pathological examination of this patient and his affected brother 
      revealed no evidence for specific abnormalities relevant to fragile X syndrome; 
      cerebellar hypoplasia, which has been reported in this disorder, was not evident 
      in either patient.

TI  - Strong similarities of the FMR1 mutation in multiple tissues: postmortem studies 
      of a male with a full mutation and a male carrier of a premutation.
PG  - 240-4
AB  - Studies of the FMR1 mutation in multiple tissues are important to further our 
      understanding of CGG repeat expansion in development and of the frequency and 
      possible clinical significance of inter-tissue heterogeneity in fragile X 
      syndrome. With some exceptions, most cases reported have shown strong similarity 
      of the mutation size and methylation status between tissues. However, there have 
      been only a few studies of multiple tissues including regions of the brain. We 
      report on two postmortem studies of multiple tissues, one of a male with a full 
      mutation (fully methylated) and one of a male carrier of a premutation. The male 
      with the full mutation (TH) had a typical presentation of fragile X syndrome, 
      including mild mental retardation. He had a methylated full mutation of two 
      predominant sizes in all 12 tissues analyzed, including three regions of the 
      brain. The male carrier of a premutation (GC) was clinically unaffected, and the 
      mutation was the same size in all 14 tissues examined including seven regions of 
      the brain. Therefore, both cases demonstrated lack of inter-tissue heterogeneity, 
      suggesting strong somatic stability after the period of expansion to the observed 
      mutation size(s). Also, both cases showed consistency between clinical phenotype 
      and mutation characteristics in the brain.

TI  - Monozygotic twin brothers with the fragile X syndrome: different CGG repeats and 
      different mental capacities.
PG  - 253-7
AB  - Little is known about the mechanism of CGG instability and the time frame of 
      instability early in embryonic development in the fragile X syndrome. Discordant 
      monozygotic twin brothers with the fragile X syndrome could give us insight into 
      the time frame of the instability. We describe monochorionic diamniotic twin 
      brothers with the fragile X syndrome who had different CGG repeats and different 
      mental capacities, whereas the normal mother had a premutation. The more retarded 
      brother had a full mutation in all his cells and no FMR-1 protein expression in 
      lymphocytes, whereas the less retarded brother had 50%/50% mosaicism for a 
      premutation and full mutation and FMR-1 protein expression in 26% of his 
      lymphocytes. The differences in repeat size could have arisen either before or 
      after the time of splitting. The time of splitting in this type of twin is around 
      day 6-7. Given the high percentage of mosaicism, we hypothesise that the 
      instability started before the time of splitting at day 6-7.

TI  - FMR1 gene expression in olfactory neuroblasts from two males with fragile X 
      syndrome.
PG  - 25-30
AB  - The fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) mutation is strongly correlated 
      with specific and marked neurobehavioral and neuroanatomical abnormalities. The 
      protein product, FMRP, is highly expressed in neurons of the normal mammalian 
      brain, and absent or in low levels in leukocytes from individuals with fragile X 
      (FraX)-associated mental impairment. Inferences which arise from these findings 
      are that FMRP has a critical role in the development and functioning of the 
      brain, and that leukocyte-derived molecular assessments provide a good indicator 
      of FMR1 expression in that organ. This latter conclusion appears true in most 
      cases even though the typical FMR1 mutation is an unstable triplet repeat 
      expansion which demonstrates somatic heterogeneity within and across tissues. 
      Blood to brain correspondence in FraX patients has only rarely been confirmed by 
      the direct study of human brain specimens and, to our knowledge, it has never 
      been studied in living individuals with the FMR1 mutation. In this report, we 
      describe the FMR1 patterns in olfactory neuroblasts (ON) from two living brothers 
      with expansion mutations in their leukocytes who are mentally retarded and 
      autistic. ON were chosen for study because they are accessible neurons closely 
      linked to the brain. In both subjects, the ON genotype was highly, but not 
      perfectly, consistent with that observed in leukocytes. Protein phenotypes across 
      tissues were completely consistent showing the absence of FMRP-immunoreactivity 
      (-ir). These results augment the limited amount of direct evidence which 
      indicates that FMR1 mutation patterns in leukocytes are a good, albeit 
      potentially fallible, reflection of such patterns in the brain. This report 
      further demonstrates the feasibility of using ON samples to evaluate the FMR1 
      mutation in humans in vivo.

TI  - Screening with the FMR1 protein test among mentally retarded males.
PG  - 520-2
AB  - The fragile X syndrome is characterized by X-linked mental retardation with 
      additional features such as a long face with large protruding ears, 
      macroorchidism, and eye-gaze avoidance. The disorder is caused by an abnormally 
      expanded CGG repeat within the first exon of the fragile X mental retardation 
      (FMR1) gene that is associated with shutdown of transcription and absence of the 
      fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Detection of patients and carriers 
      of the fragile X syndrome is done by DNA analysis of the CGG repeat, whereas the 
      FMRP antibody test allows rapid detection of male patients using bloodsmears. In 
      a screening program for the fragile X syndrome in the southwest of the 
      Netherlands, 412 males with mental retardation of unknown cause were subjected to 
      the protein test. The patients were scored for fragile X features and their DNA 
      tested for the FMR1 mutation, as reported previously. The FMRP test detected two 
      fragile X patients with a repeat expansion in FMR1, whereas normal protein 
      expression was observed in all the retarded male patients with a normal repeat. 
      The FMRP test was found to be suitable for screening among a large population of 
      retarded males. The results also suggest that mutations other than the CGG repeat 
      leading to absence of detectable FMRP are apparently rare among mentally retarded 
      males.

TI  - Re-examination of factors associated with expansion of CGG repeats using a single 
      nucleotide polymorphism in FMR1.
PG  - 1935-46
AB  - In at least 98% of fragile X syndrome cases, the disease results from expansion 
      of the CGG repeat in the 5' end of FMR1. The use of microsatellite markers in the 
      FMR1 region has revealed a disparity of risk between haplotypes for CGG repeat 
      expansion. Although instability appears to depend on both the haplotype and the 
      AGG interspersion pattern of the repeat, these factors alone do not completely 
      describe the molecular basis for the linkage disequilibrium between normal and 
      fragile X chromosomes, in part due to instability of the marker loci themselves. 
      In an effort to better understand the mechanism of dynamic mutagenesis, we have 
      searched for and discovered a single nucleotide polymorphism in intron 1 of FMR1 
      and characterized this marker, called ATL1, in 564 normal and 152 fragile X 
      chromosomes. The G allele of this marker is found in 40% of normal chromosomes, 
      in contrast to 83% of fragile X chromosomes. Not only is the G allele exclusively 
      linked to haplotypes over-represented in fragile X syndrome, but G allele 
      chromosomes also appear to transition to instability at a higher rate on 
      haplotypes negatively associated with risk of expansion. The two alleles of ATL1 
      also reveal a highly significant linkage disequilibrium between unstable 
      chromosomes and the 5' end of the CGG repeat itself, specifically the position of 
      the first AGG interruption. The data expand the number of haplotypes associated 
      with FMR1 and specifically allow discrimination, by ATL1 alleles, of single 
      haplotypes with differing predispositions to expansion. Such haplotypes should 
      prove useful in further defining the mechanism of dynamic mutagenesis.

TI  - CGG repeat interruptions in the FMR1 gene in patients with infantile autism.
PG  - 649-53
AB  - We determined the CGG repeat length and AGG interruptions in the FMR1 gene in 
      normal Chinese subjects and patients with infantile autism and mild mental 
      retardation. Genomic DNA was investigated by PCR and Southern hybridisation for 
      CGG repeat number and PCR with Mnl I restriction analysis for AGG interruption. 
      Both the normal subjects and the patients with autism have 53 CGG repeats in 
      FMR1, and the majority have two interspersed AGG. Our normal Chinese subjects 
      have a similar number of interspersed AGG as other populations. When compared 
      with the normal subjects, the autism patients have less AGG interruptions and a 
      different pattern of AGG distribution. There was a significant difference in the 
      CGG configurations between normal subjects and patients with autism. The latter 
      had less interspersed AGG, as in fragile X patients, but they did not have 
      fragile X. A study on mentally retarded patients with no infantile autism should 
      also be carried out to ascertain whether mental retardation alone may have 
      contributed to such AGG pattern.

TI  - Expanded (CAG)n, (CGG)n and (GAA)n trinucleotide repeat microsatellites, and 
      mutant purine synthesis and pigmentation genes cause schizophrenia and autism.
PG  - 223-33
AB  - Unstable (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat microsatellites are hypothesized to cause 
      schizophrenia. The (CAG)n microsatellite of dominant spinal cerebellar ataxia 
      type 1 (SCA1) is a candidate schizophrenia gene. Autism results from expansions 
      of (CGG)n and (GAA)n trinucleotide repeat stretches at fragile X syndrome 
      (FRAXA), and the recessive Friedreich's ataxia (FA). Dominant ataxia genes may 
      cause schizophrenia and recessive ataxia genes may cause autism. Syndromes with 
      autism show purine synthesis defects (PSDs) and/or pigmentation defects (PDs). 
      Autism is caused by very lengthy expansions of (CAG)n, (CGG)n and (GAA)n repeats, 
      while schizophrenia results from much smaller (CAG)n and (CGG)n repeat 
      expansions.

TI  - Fragile X DNA triplet repeats, (GCC)n, form hairpins with single hydrogen-bonded 
      cytosine.cytosine mispairs at the CpG sites: isotope-edited nuclear magnetic 
      resonance spectroscopy on (GCC)n with selective 15N4-labeled cytosine bases.
PG  - 111-20
AB  - Here, we provide a direct proof that the formation of hairpins by (GCC)n at the 
      5'-UTR of the FMR-1 gene offers a mechanism for CpG hypermethylation associated 
      with the fragile X syndrome. For this, we have performed hetero-nuclear (15N-1H) 
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy to probe the structure of the CpG sites in the 
      (GCC)n hairpins that are 15N-labeled at the amino (N4) groups of specific 
      cytosine bases. Analyses of chemical shift, pH-induced chemical exchange, and NOE 
      pattern of the (15N-labeled) amino protons of cytosine bases reveal that the 
      cytosine bases at the CpG sites are intrahelical and well-stacked with the 
      neighboring G.C base-pairs in the stem of these hairpins and probably form single 
      hydrogen-bonded C.C mispairs. Measurements of pH-dependent 1H line-width also 
      demonstrate that the C.C mispairs are more susceptible to open-closure than the 
      G.C base-pairs. Thus, the Cs at the CpG sites of the (GCC)n hairpin are "flipped 
      out" more easily to the activated state than those in the corresponding 
      Watson-Crick duplex, (GCC)n. (GGC)n and this makes the hairpin a better target 
      for methylation by the human methyltransferase, the enzyme that methylates the Cs 
      at the CpG sites.

TI  - Absence of the fragile X CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in girls diagnosed 
      with a pervasive developmental disorder.
PG  - 363-5
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of the fragile X (FRAX) 
      CGG trinucleotide expansion in a population of young girls (n = 45) diagnosed 
      with pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). Their mean age was 43.7 months 
      (range, 25 to 132 months). Diagnoses included autistic disorder (n = 20), PDD (n 
      = 23), and Asperger's syndrome (n = 2). Molecular FRAX testing was performed on 
      all patients by using the Southern gene blot technique. Genomic DNA was digested 
      with both EcoRI and EagI, fractionated on agarose gel, and blotted and probed 
      with the radiolabeled StB12.3 FMR-1 probe. None of the subjects were found to 
      have an expansion of CGG in either the 2.8 kb or 5.2 kb fragments. A 95% CI, for 
      the prevalence of the FRAX mutation in female subjects with PDD, has an upper 
      bound of 2.9%. We conclude that the prevalence of FRAX positivity in girls with 
      PDD is lower than previously reported. This raises the question of whether any 
      association between FRAX and PDD in female subjects is specific to PDD or is 
      related rather to the presence of mental retardation.

TI  - Long uninterrupted CGG repeats within the first exon of the human FMR1 gene are 
      not intrinsically unstable in transgenic mice.
PG  - 229-40
AB  - Despite the increasing number of disorders known to result from trinucleotide 
      repeat amplification, the molecular mechanism underlying these dynamic mutations 
      is still unknown. In an attempt to create a mouse model for the CGG repeat 
      instability seen in Fragile X syndrome, we constructed transgenes corresponding 
      to FMR1 premutation alleles. While in humans these alleles would expand to full 
      mutation with almost 100% certainty upon maternal transmission, they remain 
      stable in our transgenic mice. Therefore, the presence of a large number of 
      uninterrupted CGGs is not sufficient to cause instability in mice, even in the 
      context of flanking human FMR1 sequences.

TI  - Purified recombinant Fmrp exhibits selective RNA binding as an intrinsic property 
      of the fragile X mental retardation protein.
PG  - 15521-7
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is caused by the transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene 
      due to a trinucleotide repeat expansion. The encoded protein, Fmrp, has been 
      found to be a nucleocytoplasmic RNA-binding protein containing both KH domains 
      and RGG boxes that associates with polyribosomes as a ribonucleoprotein particle. 
      RNA binding has previously been demonstrated with in vitro-translated Fmrp; 
      however, it remained uncertain whether the selective RNA binding observed was an 
      intrinsic property of Fmrp or required an associated protein(s). Here, 
      baculovirus-expressed and affinity-purified FLAG-tagged murine Fmrp was shown to 
      bind directly to both ribonucleotide homopolymers and human brain mRNA. FLAG-Fmrp 
      exhibited selectivity for binding poly(G) > poly(U) >> poly(C) or poly(A). 
      Moreover, purified FLAG-Fmrp bound to only a subset of brain mRNA, including the 
      3' untranslated regions of myelin basic protein message and its own message. 
      Recombinant isoform 4, lacking the RGG boxes but maintaining both KH domains, was 
      also purified and was found to only weakly interact with RNA. FLAG-purified I304N 
      Fmrp, harboring the mutation of severe fragile X syndrome, demonstrated RNA 
      binding, in contrast to previous suggestions. These data demonstrate the 
      intrinsic property of Fmrp to selectively bind RNA and show FLAG-Fmrp as a 
      suitable reagent for structural characterization and identification of cognate 
      RNA ligands.

TI  - DNA diagnosis of FRAXA and FRAXE in Chinese children with neurodevelopmental 
      disorders and fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 179-83
AB  - Fragile X (FraX) syndrome is the most common cause of inherited mental 
      retardation. To see whether FRAXA or FRAXE can account for the etiology of some 
      unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders in children, we screened for 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in a consecutive cohort of 73 Chinese children and 
      their mothers seen in 1995 (group 1) referred for developmental assessment due to 
      developmental delay, language delay, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 
      autistic spectrum disorder, mental retardation and/or learning disability. We 
      also screened DNA samples of all five previously diagnosed 
      cytogenetically-positive FraX boys, their mothers and sisters (group 2). A 
      control group of unrelated teenagers and adults were recruited from the community 
      (group 3). In group 1, 3 families (2 mothers and a mother and her son) were found 
      to carry a small premutation allele at FRAXA (premutation frequency = 2%, 3/153 
      independent X chromosomes), but none had any expansion at FRAXE. In group 2, all 
      5 FraX boys had full mutation at FRAXA and normal repeat length at FRAXE. In 
      group 3, 1 male has a premutation allele out of 18 males and 59 females tested 
      (premutation frequency of control = 0.7%, 1 out of 136 X chromosomes). For FRAXE 
      screening in group 3, 2 females were carriers (1.5%, 2 out of 136 X chromosomes). 
      Thus, FRAXA and FRAXE cannot account for the etiology of neurodevelopmental 
      disorders in our cohort of Chinese children, and the prevalence of FRAXE mutation 
      in normal Chinese population appears to be higher than reported in the 
      Caucasians.

TI  - The construction of cDNA libraries from human single preimplantation embryos and 
      their use in the study of gene expression during development.
PG  - 344-8
AB  - PURPOSE: The construction and application of polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR)-based cDNA libraries from unfertilized human oocytes and single 
      preimplantation-stage embryos are described. The purpose of these studies is to 
      provide a readily available resource for the study of gene expression during 
      human preimplantation development. METHODS: Rapid, reproducible, and efficient 
      procedures for the construction of PCR-based cDNA libraries from fewer than 10 
      cells were first developed in small populations of fibroblast cells. We then 
      constructed cDNA libraries from eight unfertilized oocytes and single two-cell, 
      -4-cell, -7-cell, and blastocyst-stage embryos. Differential display PCR using 
      the libraries as template allows the analysis of stage-specific expression of 
      embryonic genes. Genomic libraries are also prepared from parental samples 
      (cumulus cells and sperm) corresponding to the individual embryo generating the 
      cDNA library. RESULTS: The complexities (between 10(5) and 10(6) clones) of the 
      human embryo libraries indicate that they may represent the entire active gene 
      population at these early stages of human development. Nucleotide sequence 
      analyses of random clones showed the presence of a variety of transcripts, such 
      as the human transposable element. LINE-1, Alu repeat sequences, housekeeping 
      genes, and tissue-specific genes, (e.g., alpha-globin, FMR-1, and 
      interleukin-10). Also present at the expected frequency are the ubiquitous 
      cytoskeletal elements, beta-actin, keratin-18, and alpha-tubulin. In addition to 
      cDNAs corresponding to known expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in the GenBank and 
      dbEST databases, a high proportion of novel sequences was also detected. Several 
      cDNAs were detected only at specific stages of preimplantation development by the 
      differential display analysis. CONCLUSIONS: PCR-based cDNA libraries from single 
      human preimplantation embryos provide a new and important resource for the 
      identification and study of novel genes or gene families. As such, they will 
      increase our basic understanding of the molecular control of human development. 
      In the clinical context, the libraries identify the time of onset of specific 
      genes, and hence the diseases resulting from mutation of these genes, and provide 
      information about new methods of preimplantation diagnosis. The molecular 
      analysis of early gene transcription in human embryogenesis may be expected to 
      lead to advances in contraception, assisted reproduction, and preimplantation 
      genetic diagnosis.

TI  - Clinical description of an adult male with psychosis who showed FMR1 gene 
      methylation mosaicism.
PG  - 222-4
AB  - Unstable trinucleotide repeat DNA contained in numerous genes has been proposed 
      as the underlying mechanism in the clinical phenomenon of genetic anticipation in 
      fragile X syndrome and other neurodegenerative diseases. No clear evidence has 
      been found for the role of these abnormal trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion-containing genes in schizophrenia or other psychiatric disorders. This 
      report describes an adult male with psychosis who was later found to have 
      methylation mosaicism of the FMR1 gene. We discuss history, examination, and 
      investigation which led to the diagnosis and treatment response of this patient.

TI  - Triplet repeat polymorphism & fragile X syndrome in the Indian context.
PG  - 29-36
AB  - Mental retardation due to fragile X syndrome is one of the genetic disorders 
      caused by triplet repeat expansion. CGG repeat involved in this disease is known 
      to exhibit polymorphism even among normal individuals. Here we describe the 
      development of suitable probes for detection of polymorphism in CGG repeat at 
      FMR1 locus as well as the diagnosis of fragile X syndrome. Using these methods 
      polymorphism at the FMR1 locus has been examined in 161 individuals. Ninety eight 
      patients with unclassified mental retardation were examined, of whom 7 were found 
      to have the expanded (CGG) allele at the FMR1 locus. The hybridization pattern 
      for two patients has been presented as representative data.

TI  - Interruptions in the triplet repeats of SCA1 and FRAXA reduce the propensity and 
      complexity of slipped strand DNA (S-DNA) formation.
PG  - 2701-8
AB  - Models for the disease-associated expansion of trinucleotide repeats involve the 
      participation of alternative DNA structures during replication, repair, or 
      recombination. CAT or AGG interruptions within the (CAG)n or (CGG)n repeats of 
      SCA1 or FRAXA, respectively, confer increased genetic stability to the repeats. 
      In this study, we report the formation of slipped strand structures (S-DNA) using 
      genomic sequences containing pure and interrupted SCA1 and FRAXA repeats having 
      lengths above and below the genetic stability thresholds. S-DNA forms within the 
      repeats during annealing of complementary strands containing equal lengths of 
      repeats. Increased lengths of pure repeats led to an increased propensity for 
      S-DNA formation. CAT or AGG interruptions have both quantitative and qualitative 
      effects upon S-DNA formation: they decrease the total amount of slipped 
      structures as well as limit the specific isomers formed. This demonstrates a 
      unifying inhibitory effect of interruptions in both (CAG)n and (CGG)n tracts. We 
      also present transmission stability data for SCA1 and FRAXA alleles spanning the 
      thresholds and compare these with the ability to form slipped structures. The 
      effect of both the length and purity of the repeat tract on the propensity of 
      slipped structure formation correlates with their effect on genetic instability 
      and disease, suggesting that S-DNA structures may be models for mutagenic 
      intermediates in instability.

TI  - Hairpin induced slippage and hyper-methylation of the fragile X DNA triplets.
PG  - 745-56
AB  - The fragile X triplet repeats, (GCC)n x (GGC)n are located at the 5' untranslated 
      region of the FMR-1 gene. Inordinate repeat expansion and hyper-methylation of 
      the CpG islands inside the repeat lead to the suppression of the FMR-1 gene and 
      the subsequent onset and progression of the disease. Previously, we have shown 
      that the (GCC)n strand of the fragile X repeat readily forms hairpin structures 
      under physiological conditions (Chen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 
      92:5199-5203, 1995: Mariappan et al., Nucl. Acid Res. 24:784-792, 1996). Here, we 
      show by an in vitro assay that formation of the (GCC)n hairpins leads to slippage 
      during replication. The slippage structure is a three-way junction with two 
      Watson-Crick, (GCC)n x (GGC)n, arms and a third (GCC)n hairpin arm. Formation of 
      such slippage structures during replication may explain the observed length 
      polymorphism of the fragile X repeat. We have also studied the substrate 
      efficiency of these three-way junctions toward the human methyltransferase. the 
      enzyme that methylates the CpG sites in DNA. These methylation studies show that 
      the slippage structures induced by the (GCC)n hairpins are 10-15 times more 
      efficient substrates than either the corresponding Watson-Crick duplexes or the 
      (GCC)n hairpins. We demonstrate by appropriate designs that the exceptional 
      substrate efficiency of the three-way junction slippage structures is due to two 
      factors: (i) the presence of the (GCC)n hairpin in which CpG sites are more 
      accessible for methylation than the CpG sites in the Watson-Crick duplex and (ii) 
      the ability of the (GCC)n hairpin in these three-way junctions to move along the 
      Watson-Crick arms that facilitates conversion of low-affinity Watson-Crick CpG 
      sites into high-affinity hairpin CpG sites. Therefore, we suggest that the 
      formation of the (GCC)n hairpins during replication can explain both length 
      polymorphism and hyper-methylation of the fragile X repeats.

TI  - Unusual mutations in high functioning fragile X males: apparent instability of 
      expanded unmethylated CGG repeats.
PG  - 103-11
AB  - We report on further cases of high functioning fragile X males showing decreased 
      expression of FMR1 protein, absence of detectable methylation at the EagI site in 
      the FMR1 gene promoter, and highly unusual patterns of fragile X mutations 
      defined as smear of expansions extending from premutation to full mutation range. 
      Very diffuse and therefore not easily detectable patterns of full mutations were 
      also observed on prenatal testing using DNA from chorionic villi sampled at a 
      time of development when full mutations were still unmethylated in this 
      particular tissue. In the search for possible determinants of such unusual 
      patterns, repeat expansions in the premutation and in the lower full mutation 
      range were identified on genomic PstI blots previously prepared for fragile X DNA 
      testing. Cases with 130 or more triplets, and a number of shorter repeats, were 
      reinvestigated on EcoRI plus EagI digests. Among the 119 expansions, there were 
      22 in our sample showing either blurred bands or smears on PstI blots. This 
      particular characteristic was strongly associated with the coincidence of a 
      repeat size of more than 130 triplets and absence of EagI site methylation. Our 
      data set also includes cases of mosaic patterns consisting of smears of 
      unmethylated expansions to more than 130 CGGs and of clear bands of methylated 
      expansions. We therefore suggest that in fragile X syndrome unusual smeared 
      patterns of mutations result from somatic instability of larger repeats under 
      circumstantial absence of repeat methylation.

TI  - Instability of the FMR2 trinucleotide repeat region associated with expanded FMR1 
      alleles.
PG  - 447-55
AB  - The fragile sites FRAXA and FRAXE, located approximately 600 kb apart on Xq27.3 
      and Xq28, respectively, are due to a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion. Although 
      the expansion mechanism for these and other trinucleotide repeat disorders 
      remains unknown, the similarities between the FRAXA and FRAXE regions suggest a 
      possible association between the 2 sites. DNA from 953 individuals was analyzed 
      to determine the distribution of FRAXE repeat sizes in this population and to 
      ascertain potential association between FRAXA and FRAXE repeat sizes. Thirty-four 
      FMR2 alleles ranging from 3-42 repeats were identified. No FRAXE expansions were 
      found in this population, supporting previous findings that FRAXE expansions are 
      rare. However, in the fragile X syndrome affected group, a FMR2 delection, 2 
      cases of FRAXE repeat instability and a FRAXE mosaic male were identified. Also, 
      a previously identified, rare FMR2 polymorphism was observed. Statistical 
      analysis showed no correlation between normal FRAXA and FRAXE repeat sizes 
      studied, although there was a significant size difference in larger FMR2 alleles 
      that segregated with expanded FMR1 alleles. These findings support the idea of an 
      association between repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene and instability or 
      deletions in the FMR2 gene.

TI  - The rat androgen-binding protein (ABP/SHBG) gene contains triplet repeats similar 
      to unstable triplets: evidence that the ABP/SHBG and the fragile X-related 2 
      genes overlap.
PG  - 2-4
AB  - The rat androgen-binding protein/sex hormone-binding globulin (ABP/SHBG) gene is 
      regulated by promoters P1 and PA. P1 regulates the mRNA encoding secreted 
      ABP/SHBG, whereas PA regulates an alternate mRNA which encodes a modified protein 
      that is targeted to the nucleus. Promoter PA is GC rich, consisting of 70-80% GC 
      residues. During routine BLAST sequence analysis it was discovered that this 
      GC-rich region is highly related to the human fragile X-related protein 2 (FXR-2) 
      5'-untranslated RNA sequence. Furthermore, the nucleotide coding sequence of the 
      initial 14 FXR-2 amino acid residues was identical in the ABP/SHBG gene. The 
      5'-untranslated FXR-2 sequence contains triplet (CGG) repeats, which are also 
      present in the rat ABP/SHBG gene. The meiotic instability of CGG repeats in the 
      human fragile X (FMR1) gene causes the fragile X mental retardation syndrome. The 
      data presented here suggest that the ABP/SHBG and FXR-2 genes overlap with each 
      gene transcribed in the opposite direction. In support of this structure, the 
      human ABP/SHBG and the FXR-2 genes map to the same site on chromosome 17. Thus, 
      the ABP/SHBG gene contains triplet repeats in the alternate promoter PA. It will 
      be of particular interest to determine if triplet instability affects ABP/SHBG 
      gene expression. A triplet instability in the X-linked androgen receptor gene 
      causes spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.

TI  - Fragile X premutations are not a major cause of early menopause.
PG  - 1362-9
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked mental retardation condition that usually is 
      due to a trinucleotide-repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene. Whereas full-mutation 
      alleles (> 230 repeats) lead to fragile X syndrome, premutation alleles 
      (approximately 60-200 repeats) are apparently non-penetrant. However, previous 
      studies have suggested that female premutation carriers may have an increased 
      incidence of premature menopause. To test this possible association, we screened 
      for premutation alleles among 216 women with early menopause (at age < 47 years), 
      33 of whom had premature menopause (at age < 40 years), as well as among 107 
      control women, all of whom were ascertained solely on the basis of age at 
      menopause. No full-mutation alleles were found; and only one premutation allele 
      was found, but, it was in a member of the control group. These results are 
      consistent with what would be expected on the basis of chance only. Our sample 
      size was sufficient to rule out a > or = 3-fold increased risk of early menopause 
      and a > or = 9-fold increased risk of premature menopause due to an FMR1 
      premutation, under a model considering the risk of both sporadic and familial 
      early menopause. Likewise, our results rule out a > or = 4-fold increased risk of 
      familial early menopause and a > or = 26-fold increased risk of familial 
      premature menopause, under a less probable model in which only familial early 
      menopause is considered. These results indicate that the fragile X premutation is 
      not a major risk factor for early menopause and suggest that the risk of 
      premature menopause to fragile X-premutation carriers may not be as great as that 
      reported elsewhere.

TI  - Molecular and cytogenetic investigations of the fragile X region including the 
      Frax A and Frax E CGG trinucleotide repeat sequences in families multiplex for 
      autism and related phenotypes.
PG  - 254-62
AB  - We undertook molecular and cytogenetic analyses in 25 families multiplex for 
      autism and related disorders. Three of the multiplex families exhibited fragile 
      X, and the affected offspring all exhibited CGG triplet repeat insertion 
      mutations in the FMR-1 gene. One of these families contained an affected pair of 
      monozygotic female twins. Both had similar-sized CGG triplet repeat expansions, 
      but different phenotypic manifestations. One suffered from autism and the other 
      from mild mental retardation and marked social anxiety. PCR and Southern 
      hybridization analysis of the CGG repeat sequences characterizing fragile X A 
      (Frax A) and E and the methylation status of FMR-1 showed no evidence of abnormal 
      CGG repeat expansion or FMR-1 hypermethylation in the remaining 22 multiplex 
      families. Moreover, there was no correlation between the Frax A or E (CGG)n 
      repeat length with affected status, nor any association with the low-level (< 3 
      %) expression of cytogenetic fragility at Xq27 previously reported in these 
      families. Our findings indicate that most instances of recurrence in families 
      multiplex for autism and related disorders are not accounted for by Frax A and E. 
      They also indicate that the phenotypic manifestations of Frax A may be influenced 
      by stochastic, environmental and other biological factors.

TI  - Screening for FMR1 and FMR2 mutations in 222 individuals from Spanish special 
      schools: identification of a case of FRAXE-associated mental retardation.
PG  - 503-7
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of familial mental 
      retardation. It results from a (CGG)n trinucleotide expansion in the FMR1 gene 
      leading to the typical Martin-Bell phenotype. Clinical features vary depending on 
      age and sex. Expansion of a (CCG)n repeat in the FMR2 gene corresponds to the 
      FRAXE fragile site which lies distal to FRAXA and is also associated with mental 
      retardation, but it is less frequent and lacks a consistent phenotype. Analysis 
      of repeat expansions in these two genes allows the molecular diagnosis of these 
      different entities. We report here the screening of the FRAXA and FRAXE mutations 
      in 222 unrelated mentally retarded individuals attending Spanish special schools. 
      PCR and/or Southern blotting methods were used. We detected full mutations in the 
      FMR1 gene in 11 boys (4.9%) and 1 boy (0.5%) with a CCG repeat expansion in the 
      FMR2 gene. The latter shows mild mental retardation with psychotic behaviour and 
      no remarkable physical traits. Molecular studies revealed a mosaicism for 
      methylation in the FMR2 gene. This case supports the observation that expansions 
      greater than 100 repeats can be partially methylated and cause the phenotype.

TI  - Deletion of all CGG repeats plus flanking sequences in FMR1 does not abolish gene 
      expression.
PG  - 961-7
AB  - The fragile X syndrome is due to the new class of dynamic mutations. It is 
      associated with an expansion of a trinucleotide repeat (CGG) in exon 1 of the 
      fragile X mental retardation gene 1 gene (FMR1). Here we present a fragile X 
      family with an unique female patient who was rendered hemizygous for the FRAXA 
      locus due to a large deletion of one X chromosome. In addition, the other X had a 
      microdeletion in FMR1. PCR and sequence analysis revealed that the microdeletion 
      included all CGG repeats plus 97 bp of flanking sequences, leaving transcription 
      start site and translation start site intact. Despite this total lack of CGG 
      repeats in the FMR1 gene, Western blot analysis showed expression of FMRP, and 
      the patient's phenotype was essentially normal. X-inactivation studies of the 
      androgen-receptor (AR) locus and haplotype determination of microsatellite 
      markers gave evidence that the deletion probably originated from regression of a 
      fully mutated FMR1 gene. Although the minimal number of CGG repeats hitherto 
      reported in FRAXA is six, and at least four other genes associated with CGG 
      repeats are known, suggesting an as yet unknown function of these repeats, our 
      study clearly demonstrates that the absence of CGG repeats does not abolish 
      expression of the FMR1 gene in lymphoblastoid cells.

TI  - Computer simulation of expansions of DNA triplet repeats in the fragile X 
      syndrome and Huntington's disease.
PG  - 53-67
AB  - The expansion of DNA triplet repeats has been shown to be responsible for about a 
      dozen hereditary diseases. In this paper we are concerned with a computer model 
      of such expansion, applied to the fragile X syndrome and Huntington's disease, 
      for which enough quantitative data have been collected. The nucleotide sequence 
      associated with the fragile X consists of CGG repeats and is located inside the 
      FMR1 gene. In normal individuals there is a variable number of triplet repeats 
      less than 60; in asymptomatic carriers the number of repeats is 60-200 
      (premutation). From the premutation range, the number of triplet repeats can 
      increase within one generation to more than 200 producing affected individuals. 
      In Huntington's disease the CAG repeats are located inside the HD gene. In normal 
      individuals the number of repeats varies from around 11, up to 34. In the 
      intermediate range (34-37 repeats), the mutability is increased, frequently 
      leading to alleles of more than 37 repeats, and the disease phenotype. The rapid 
      increase of the number of triplet repeats in affected individuals has been 
      proposed to be due to the formation of folded DNA structures (hairpins) and their 
      repair or misrepair. In order to determine if this proposed mechanism is adequate 
      to account for the rapid increase of repeats and the large number of repeats in 
      affected individuals we developed a mathematical model that includes the known 
      mechanisms of hairpin formation, and strand synthesis and repair. Simulations 
      based on the model using realistic probabilities of hairpin formation produced 
      results that corresponded with the observed range of repeats and transition 
      probabilities from normal to affected individuals. Similar modelling has been 
      published for the Huntington's disease data. However, in this paper we 
      demonstrate that a uniform approach works for fragile X and Huntington's disease, 
      although the detailed assumptions of the model have to be different. These 
      difference provide insight into the mechanisms of expansion in both cases. Among 
      these insights is that an apparent threshold in the number of repeats for rapid 
      expansion, and the preference for expansion over contraction, may be accounted 
      for by relative probabilities of hairpin formation, replication, slippage and 
      repair.

TI  - The effect of FMR1 CGG repeat interruptions on mutation frequency as measured by 
      sperm typing.
PG  - 627-31
AB  - Fragile X syndrome results from the unstable expansion of a CGG repeat within the 
      FMR1 gene. Three classes of FMR1 alleles have been identified, normal alleles 
      with 6-60 repeats, premutations with 60-200 repeats, and full mutations with > 
      230 repeats. Premutations are exquisitely unstable upon transmission. Normal 
      alleles, while generally stable upon transmission, are thought to have different 
      intrinsic mutation frequencies, such that some normal alleles may be predisposed 
      towards expansion while others may be more resistant to such change. One variable 
      that may account for this difference is the occurrence of one or more AGG 
      triplets punctuating the normal CGG repeat. The AGG interruptions lead to alleles 
      that have equivalent overall length but different lengths of perfect repeats. To 
      test the influence of the length of perfect repeats on stability, we examined the 
      CGG repeat of single sorted sperm from two males, each with 39 total repeats, but 
      distinct AGG interruption patterns. Sorted sperm of each donor showed -15% 
      variation in repeat length, consistent with previous studies of sorted sperm at 
      other triplet repeat loci. However, when discounting the majority variation of 
      +/-1 repeat, the male with 29 perfect repeats showed 3% expansion changes while 
      the donor with only 19 perfect repeats had none (< 0.9%). Moreover, > 90% of all 
      variant sperm, including all those observed with expansions, showed expansion or 
      contraction of the 3' end of the repeat array. These data are consistent with the 
      hypothesis that perfect repeat tracts influence the repeat stability and that 
      changes of the FMR1 repeat exhibit polarity.

TI  - Molecular genetic analysis of the FMR-1 gene in a large collection of autistic 
      patients.
PG  - 224-9
AB  - A genetic etiology in autism is now strongly supported by family and twin 
      studies. A 3:1 ratio of affected males to females suggests the involvement of at 
      least one X-linked locus in the disease. Several reports have indicated an 
      association of the fragile X chromosomal anomaly at Xq27.3 (FRAXA) with autism, 
      whereas others have not supported this finding. We have so far collected blood 
      from 105 simplex and 18 multiplex families and have assessed 141 patients by 
      using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), the Autism Diagnostic 
      Observation Scale, and psychometric tests. All four ADI-R algorithm criteria were 
      met by 131 patients (93%), whereas 10 patients (7%) showed a broader phenotype of 
      autism. Southern blot analysis was performed with three different enzymes, and 
      filters were hybridized to an FMR-1-specific probe to detect amplification of the 
      CCG repeat at FRAXA, to the complete FMR-1 cDNA probe, and to additional probes 
      from the neighborhood of the gene. No significant changes were found in 139 
      patients (99%) from 122 families, other than the normal variations in the 
      population. In the case of one multiplex family with three children showing no 
      dysmorphic features of the fragile X syndrome (one male meeting 3 out of 4 
      ADI-algorithm criteria, one normal male with slight learning disability but 
      negative ADI-R testing, and one fully autistic female), the FRAXA 
      full-mutation-specific CCG-repeat expansion in the genotype was not correlated 
      with the autism phenotype. Further analysis revealed a mosaic pattern of 
      methylation at the FMR-1 gene locus in the two sons of the family, indicating at 
      least a partly functional gene. Therefore, we conclude that the association of 
      autism with fragile X at Xq27.3 is non-existent and exclude this location as a 
      candidate gene region for autism.

TI  - Effect of in vitro promoter methylation and CGG repeat expansion on FMR-1 
      expression.
PG  - 2883-7
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is associated with a CGG repeat expansion in the 
      5'-untranslated region of the FMR-1 gene. Within the FMR-1 promoter a CpG island 
      is frequently methylated in fragile X patients. To identify the effect of 
      methylation on FMR-1 expression, we transfected methylated and unmethylated 
      constructs containing the FMR-1 promoter in front of the CAT gene (pFXCAT) into 
      COS-1 cells. No difference between methylated and unmethylated DNA was observed 
      initially, whereas reduced CAT mRNA levels were observed 48 h post-transfection 
      of the methylated construct and increased CAT activity from unmethylated DNA was 
      observed at 72 h. To determine the effect of a CGG repeat expansion on gene 
      expression, we inserted >200 CGG repeats between the SV40 promoter and the CAT 
      gene (pSV2CAT). A 3-fold reduction in CAT activity was observed 24-48 h 
      post-transfection. To study the correlation between CGG repeat expansion and 
      FMR-1 transcription, we inserted 200 CGG trinucleotide repeats into the pFXCAT 
      construct. Only a slight difference in mRNA levels was found between cells 
      transfected with pFX(CGG)200CAT or pFXCAT, but a complete lack of CAT activity 
      was observed with introduction of the repeat. We conclude that a moderate size 
      repeat markedly reduces translation. We propose that the presence of a repeat 
      expansion per se is the major factor influencing FMR-1 function in fragile X 
      syndrome.

TI  - Rapid protein sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry and cDNA cloning of 
      p20-CGGBP. A novel protein that binds to the unstable triplet repeat 
      5'-d(CGG)n-3' in the human FMR1 gene.
PG  - 16761-8
AB  - The autonomous expansion of the unstable 5'-d(CGG)n-3' repeat in the 
      5'-untranslated region of the human FMR1 gene leads to the fragile X syndrome, 
      one of the most frequent causes of mental retardation in human males. We have 
      recently described the isolation of a protein p20-CGGBP that binds 
      sequence-specifically to the double-stranded trinucleotide repeat 5'-d(CGG)-3' 
      (Deissler, H., Behn-Krappa, A., and Doerfler, W. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 
      4327-4334). We demonstrate now that the p20-CGGBP can also bind to an interrupted 
      repeat sequence. Peptide sequence tags of p20-CGGBP obtained by nanoelectrospray 
      mass spectrometry were screened against an expressed sequence tag data base, 
      retrieving a clone that contained the full-length coding sequence for p20-CGGBP. 
      A bacterially expressed fusion protein p20-CGGBP-6xHis exhibits a binding pattern 
      to the double-stranded 5'-d(CGG)n-3' repeat similar to that of the authentic 
      p20-CGGBP. This novel protein lacks any overall homology to other known proteins 
      but carries a putative nuclear localization signal. The p20-CGGBP gene is 
      conserved among mammals but shows no homology to non-vertebrate species. The gene 
      encoding the sequence for the new protein has been mapped to human chromosome 3.

TI  - The fragile X CGG repeat shows a marked level of instability in hereditary 
      non-polyposis colorectal cancer patients.
PG  - 89-93
AB  - The allelic variation of the FMR1 CGG repeat was investigated by small-pool PCR 
      in nonneoplastic peripheral blood leukocytes from HNPCC patients and matched 
      controls for similar CGG repeat lengths. The allelic variation for repeat lengths 
      appears to be roughly twice as frequent in HNPCC patients as in controls, 
      especially when patients are mutated in hMLH1. There are more expansions in HNPCC 
      patients (42%) than in controls (20%) but this difference is statistically 
      borderline. The mean length of expansions relative to the genuine size did not 
      differ in HNPCC patients or controls (respectively 17% and 20% of the 
      constitutional allelic length). The reported data suggest that instability within 
      nonneoplastic cells of a subset of HNPCC patients might be one mechanism for 
      transition from normal to the premutation range of the FMR1 CGG repeat.

TI  - The frequency of fragile X syndrome among selected patients at Songklanagarind 
      Hospital during 1991-1996, studied by cytogenetic and molecular methods.
PG  - 69-74
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of mental disability, 
      world-wide. Main clinical features are cognitive deficit, speech difficulties, 
      delayed development, autism, and particular physical characteristics. The 
      syndrome can be cytogenetically diagnosed by the expression of chromosome X 
      fragile site at band Xq27.3. At molecular level, the cause of the syndrome is 
      defined as an abnormal expansion of CGG trinucleotide repeats in the 5'UTR of the 
      FMR-1 gene as well as hypermethylation at the proximal CpG island. Study of 
      fragile X syndrome at Songklanagarind Hospital during May 1991-June 1996 was 
      herein reported. A total of 287 blood samples of 260 unrelated families were 
      cytogenetically examined by using lymphocyte culture method with 2-4 different 
      treatments. Frequency of positive fragile X cases was found to be 7 in 260 
      (2.7%). Among relatives of the positive ones, 13 individuals were also positive. 
      Other types of chromosome abnormalities were detected in 13 cases (5%). For 
      molecular study, DNA samples were obtained from 97 cases. Investigation of CGG 
      repeat expansion was performed by PCR method. Abnormal expansion was identified 
      as full mutation (> 200 repeats) and premutation (> 50-200 repeats). The 
      abnormalities were found in 14 individuals of 5 unrelated cases; 6 with full 
      mutation and 8 with premutation. No molecular study on the two cytogenetic 
      positive cases has been performed. In conclusion, a total of 50 individuals with 
      fragile X abnormality has been documented: 18 affected cases and 32 carriers. 
      Investigation of the remaining suspected members in positive families is in 
      progress. The information and experience will lead to prevention of this genetic 
      disease by prenatal diagnosis and elective abortion in Thailand.

TI  - Nuclease sensitivity of permeabilized cells confirms altered chromatin formation 
      at the fragile X locus.
PG  - 435-41
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is caused by the expansion and concomitant methylation of a 
      CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR1 gene which results in the 
      transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene, delayed replication of the FMR1 
      locus, and the formation of a folate sensitive fragile site (FRAXA) at Xq27.3. 
      The mechanism by which repeat expansion and methylation causes these changes is 
      unknown. An in vivo system in which cells were permeabilized with 
      lysophosphatidylcholine followed by digestion with MspI endonuclease was utilized 
      to assess the chromatin conformation at the fragile X locus. The FMR1 gene was 
      inaccessible to MspI digestion in fragile X patients, but not in normal or 
      carrier individuals, confirming that altered chromatin conformation results from 
      the repeat expansion and methylation seen in fragile X syndrome.

TI  - Nucleosome assembly on methylated CGG triplet repeats in the fragile X mental 
      retardation gene 1 promoter.
PG  - 24325-8
AB  - Expansion and methylation of CGG repeat sequences is associated with Fragile X 
      syndrome in humans. We have examined the consequences of CGG repeat expansion and 
      methylation for nucleosome assembly and positioning on the Fragile X Mental 
      Retardation gene 1 (FMR1) gene. Short unmethylated CGG repeats are not 
      particularly favored in terms of affinity for the histone octamer or for 
      positioning of the reconstituted nucleosome. However, upon methylation their 
      affinity for the histone octamer increases and a highly positioned nucleosome 
      assembles with the repeat sequences found adjacent to the nucleosomal dyad. 
      Expansion of these CGG repeats abolishes the preferential nucleosome assembly due 
      to methylation. Thus, the expansion and methylation of these triplet repeats can 
      alter the functional organization of chromatin, which may contribute to 
      alterations in the expression of the FMR1 gene and the disease phenotype.

TI  - Expansion and methylation status at FRAXE can be detected on EcoRI blots used for 
      FRAXA diagnosis: analysis of four FRAXE families with mild mental retardation in 
      males.
PG  - 847-54
AB  - The original test for the analysis of the CCG expansion at the FRAXE locus 
      involves Southern blot analysis of HindIII digests. We show that, by using a 
      different probe, the FRAXE mutation can be detected easily on the same EcoRI or 
      EagI+EcoRI blots as are used for detection of FRAXA. Unexpectedly, we found that 
      both the expansion and methylation status can be determined on a single EcoRI 
      digest, because of the presence of a methylation-sensitive EcoRI site very close 
      to the CCG repeat. We thus detected in a series of mentally retarded individuals 
      previously tested for FRAXA expansion a FRAXE proband who led to the 
      identification of a large sibship (7 of 10 children carrying a mutation). We also 
      show that two fragile X families without FRAXA mutation that previously have been 
      described by Oberle et al. have the FRAXE expansion. In another family also 
      ascertained initially by cytogenetic finding of a fragile X site, we performed 
      the combined cytogenetic and molecular prenatal diagnosis of a mutated male 
      fetus. All nine males (>3 years old) in whom we found a methylated mutation had 
      mild mental retardation. Our results suggest that the threshold of repeat length 
      for abnormal methylation and fragile-site expression may be smaller at FRAXE than 
      at FRAXA.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of inherited mental retardation. The 
      incidence has been estimated to be 1 in 1250 males and 1 in 2000 females. 
      Molecular studies have shown that 95% of fragile X syndrome cases are caused by 
      the expansion of a CGG triplet in the FMR1 gene with hypermethylation of the 
      adjacent CpG island. In spite of the high incidence of this syndrome, a female 
      with both FMR1 genes in the expanded form has never been reported. We presenting 
      mental retardation and attention problems. Molecular analysis has revealed that 
      both of her FMR1 genes have the CGG expansion, one with a premutation and the 
      other with a full mutation. We have studied the CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene in 64 
      members of her family and detected 33 normal individuals, 14 carriers with the 
      premutation (1 male and 13 females), and 18 individuals with full mutations (8 
      males and 10 females). The index case illustrates that the possibility of both 
      parents being carriers of the fragile X syndrome premutation should be considered 
      in consanguineous families or in small communities.

TI  - Mosaicism of a microdeletion of 486 bp involving the CGG repeat of the FMR1 gene 
      due to misalignment of GTT tandem repeats at chi-like elements flanking both 
      breakpoints and a full mutation.
PG  - 409-14
AB  - Although the majority of fragile-X patients demonstrate methylation and a 
      much-expanded CGG repeat region in the 5'-untranslated region of exon 1 of the 
      FMR1 gene, exceptional cases have been reported to be due to deletions. However, 
      fine mapping of the deletion breakpoints is still lacking and so far the 
      underlying mechanism is unknown. We identified a fragile-X patient mosaic for a 
      full mutation and a microdeletion. The microdeletion spans 486 bp, involving 168 
      bp upstream from the CGG repeat region, the entire CGG repeat region, exon 1, and 
      138 bp of the first intron of the FMR1 gene. In contrast to previous reports, the 
      5' breakpoint does not fall into the hotspot region. The proximal breakpoint, 
      5'-GTGGTT/T-3', and the distal breakpoint, 5'-GTTGTT/GG-3', can be characterized 
      as chi-like elements and are flanked by direct tandem repeats. Mosaicism of a 
      full mutation and the microdeletion in the DNA of the patient's leukocytes 
      indicates the mitotic origin of the microdeletion. Since the microdeletion allele 
      is unmethylated, it can be concluded that it is not derived from the methylated 
      full mutation but from an unmethylated premutational allele.

TI  - Lack of expansion of triplet repeats in the FMR1, FRAXE, and FRAXF loci in male 
      multiplex families with autism and pervasive developmental disorders.
PG  - 399-403
AB  - Sib, twin, and family studies have shown that a genetic cause exists in many 
      cases of autism, with a portion of cases associated with a fragile X chromosome. 
      Three folate-sensitive fragile sites in the Xq27-->Xq28 region have been cloned 
      and found to have polymorphic trinucleotide repeats at the respective sites; 
      these repeats are amplified and methylated in individuals who are positive for 
      the different fragile sites. We have tested affected boys and their mothers from 
      19 families with two autistic/PDD boys for amplification and/or instability of 
      the triplet repeats at these loci and concordance of inheritance of alleles by 
      affected brothers. In all cases, the triplet repeat numbers were within the 
      normal range, with no individuals having expanded or premutation-size alleles. 
      For each locus, there was no evidence for an increased frequency of concordance, 
      indicating that mutations within these genes are unlikely to be responsible for 
      the autistic/PDD phenotypes in the affected boys. Thus, we think it is important 
      to retest those autistic individuals who were cytogenetically positive for a 
      fragile X chromosome, particularly cases where there is no family history of the 
      fragile X syndrome, using the more accurate DNA-based testing procedures.

TI  - Molecular-clinical correlations in males with an expanded FMR1 mutation.
PG  - 388-94
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is caused by an expansion of a CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene. 
      The CGG repeat number of the FMR1 mutation and the percentage of cells with 
      methylation of the gene were studied in 218 male patients. Physical and cognitive 
      measurements were also performed. Patients were divided into three groups; those 
      with full mutation and complete methylation (n = 160), those with full mutation 
      and partial methylation (n = 12), and those with a mosaic pattern (n = 46). 
      Statistical comparisons were made between males with the fully methylated full 
      mutation and those with a mosaic pattern. Males having full mutation with 
      complete methylation had the lowest IQ scores and greatest physical involvement. 
      These significant differences were seen only in ages after puberty. CGG repeat 
      length did not correlate with IQ or the physical index score in any group. These 
      findings suggest that a partial production of FMR1 protein may predict milder 
      clinical involvement in some males with fragile X syndrome.

TI  - Molecular/clinical correlations in females with fragile X.
PG  - 340-5
AB  - Females who are affected by fragile X syndrome (FXS) can have significant 
      physical, neuropsychological and emotional involvement. This study was designed 
      to explore the relationships between these three domains and to learn how the 
      degree of involvement in each of these phenotypic areas relates to molecular 
      parameters including CGG repeat length and activation ratio (the proportion of 
      normal FMR1 alleles on the active X chromosome). Three groups of females were 
      studied: 35 women who grew up in a fragile X family but do not carry an FMR1 
      mutation, 92 women with a premutation, and 29 women with a full mutation. 
      Correlations between neurocognitive, physical and emotional traits were 
      calculated for each of the three groups. Within the full mutation group 
      significant correlations were seen between schizotypal traits and full scale IQ. 
      The Lie scale was significantly correlated with the physical findings index. The 
      activation ratio correlated significantly with the measure of executive function 
      (r = .50, P = .01). There was a trend toward correlations of activation ratio 
      with the physical index score, outer ear prominence and IQ. CGG repeat number 
      significantly correlated only with the physical index (r = .44, P = .01). Thus, 
      activation ratio may be the more pertinent molecular parameter in full mutation 
      women in determining the degree of cognitive and physical phenotypic involvement.

TI  - Deletion in the FMR1 gene in a fragile-X male.
PG  - 293-5
AB  - The pathogenesis of Fragile-X syndrome is a consequence of absence of the FMR1 
      gene product associated with expansion of the CGG repeat and abnormal methylation 
      of this and a CpG island 250 bp proximal to the CGG repeat located at exon 1 in 
      the FMR1 gene. While this is usually the case, some suspected Fragile-X syndrome 
      patients have been described with a mutation other than CGG expansion. We 
      describe here an affected Fragile-X male, who was found to be mosaic of a full 
      mutation of the CGG expansion and a deletion in the FMR1 gene. The patient's 
      phenotype is probably mainly due to the effect of the full mutation of the repeat 
      sequence. Thus, the influence of the deletion is difficult to evaluate.

AB  - Fragile X DNA studies were carried out on all obligate carriers of a large 
      fragile X family with 10 mentally retarded individuals. One 64-year-old carrier 
      man with an altered FMR-1 allele was not described as being mentally retarded or 
      as having any limitations in function. He was married, raised 8 children, and 
      worked as an auto mechanic. On examination, he had macrocephaly and mild 
      macroorchidism but few of the other typical physical findings of males with 
      fragile X syndrome. His Full Scale IQ is 73, and his Vineland Adaptive Behavior 
      Composite is 73. On the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised, he 
      achieved standard scores of 64 in Reading, 55 in Math, and 83 in Knowledge. His 
      DNA findings showed a broad smear on Southern blot analysis of 100-500 CGG 
      repeats and no methylation at the EagI site upstream of the FMR-1 protein coding 
      region. His FMR-1 protein production is 12% of normal. His daughters all have 
      large premutations, with somatic instability in the size of the CGG repeat 
      lengths. They all have evidence of academic underachievement and 2 have physical 
      characteristics frequently described in individuals with fragile X.

TI  - Molecular-intelligence correlations in young fragile X males with a mild CGG 
      repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene.
PG  - 274-7
AB  - Several mechanisms can explain the occurrence of full-mutation fragile X males 
      with an IQ level above -2 SD below mean, also called "high-functioning fragile X 
      males." Incomplete methylation of the CpG island at the 5' end of the FMR1 gene 
      is one of these mechanisms. The present study describes the physical and behavior 
      phenotypes in 7 fragile X boys with CGG repeat insertions in the FMR1 gene 
      between 600-2,400 base pairs. The degree of methylation at the FMR1-associated 
      CpG island ranges in peripheral blood lymphocytes from 0-95%. Subjects with a low 
      degree of methylation at this site have mild or absent physical characteristics 
      of the fragile X syndrome, while subjects with a high degree of methylation at 
      this site have more severe physical characteristics. In this range of CGG repeat 
      insertion (600-2,400 base pairs), the degree of methylation at the 
      FMR1-associated CpG island is a good predictor of intelligence, while CGG repeat 
      insertion length is not.

TI  - Large domains of apparent delayed replication timing associated with triplet 
      repeat expansion at FRAXA and FRAXE.
PG  - 407-16
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansions have been implicated in the causation of a number 
      of neurodegenerative disorders. In the case of fragile X syndrome, full expansion 
      of the FMR1 repeat element (CGG)n has also been correlated with replication 
      timing delay of the locus and proximal flanking sequences in male lymphoblasts. 
      To define more extensively this altered region of DNA replication, as well as to 
      extend these studies to female cells containing premutant and mutant alleles, 
      study of the replication timing properties of a >2-Mb zone in the FRAXA region 
      (Xq27.3-q28) was undertaken by using a FISH technique. In this assay, relative 
      times of replication of specific loci are inferred from the ratios of singlet and 
      doublet hybridization signals in interphase nuclei. In all individuals with a 
      full expansion of the trinucleotide repeat, a large (1-1.2-Mb) region of delayed 
      timing was observed; the apparent timing of the earlier-replicating allele in 
      female cells in this region was intermediate between normal and affected alleles 
      in males, which is in accordance with expectations of a mixed population of cells 
      resulting from random X inactivation. In addition, expansion of the nearby FRAXE 
      locus also was found to correlate with replication timing delay, although the 
      extent of the altered region was somewhat less. Trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      thus may be acting in the Xq27.3-q28 region to alter long-range chromatin 
      structure that could influence transcription of gene sequences within the 
      affected domain.

TI  - Stability of triplet repeats of myotonic dystrophy and fragile X loci in human 
      mutator mismatch repair cell lines.
PG  - 151-7
AB  - At least nine human genetic diseases, including myotonic dystrophy (DM) and 
      fragile X syndrome have been associated with the expansion of CTG or CGG 
      trinucleotide repeats within the disease loci. Little is known about the 
      molecular mechanisms or the genetic control of the expansion of triplet repeats. 
      Mutations in human mismatch repair genes are associated with the increased 
      polymorphism of many microsatellites, including dinucleotide repeats. The effect 
      of mutations in two mismatch repair genes on the size of trinucleotide repeats in 
      the DM and FRAXA loci has been analyzed. PCR and Southern analysis of the triplet 
      repeat regions of the DM and fragile X mental retardation (FRAXA) loci in cell 
      lines HTC116 and LoVo, which contain mutations in both alleles of the hMLH1 and 
      hMSH2 genes, respectively, indicated that the size of the endogenous (CTG)n and 
      (CGG)n tracts fall within the range observed in the normal population. This 
      suggests that mutations in hMLH1 or hMSH2 do not result in the instability of CTG 
      or CGG tracts to the levels observed in individuals with myotonic dystrophy or 
      fragile X syndrome.

TI  - Evidence for high-risk haplotypes and (CGG)n expansion in fragile X syndrome in 
      the Hellenic population of Greece and Cyprus.
PG  - 234-8
AB  - The expansion of the trinucleotide repeat (CGG)n in successive generations 
      through maternal meiosis is the cause of fragile X syndrome. Analysis of CA 
      repeat polymorphisms flanking the FMR-1 gene provides evidence of a limited 
      number of "founder" chromosomes and predisposing high-risk haplotypes related to 
      the mutation. To investigate the origin of mutations in the fragile X syndrome in 
      the Hellenic populations of Greece and Cyprus, we studied the alleles and 
      haplotypes at DXS548 and FRAXAC2 loci of 16 independent fragile X and 70 normal 
      control chromosomes. In addition, we studied 191 unrelated normal X chromosomes 
      for the distribution and frequencies of CGG alleles. At DXS548, 6 alleles were 
      found, 2 (194 and 196) of which were represented on fragile X chromosomes. At 
      FRAXAC2, 6 alleles were found, 4 of which were present on fragile X chromosomes. 
      Sixteen haplotypes were identified, but only 5 were present on fragile X 
      chromosomes. The highest number of CGG repeats (> or = 33) were associated with 
      haplotypes 194-147, 194-151, 194-153, and 204-155. The data provide evidence for 
      founder chromosomes and high-risk haplotypes in the Hellenic population.

TI  - Extended gene diversity at the FMR1 locus and neighbouring CA repeats in a 
      sub-Saharan population.
PG  - 216-9
AB  - We report on the allele distributions in a normal black African population at two 
      microsatellite loci neighbouring the FRAXA locus and at the CGG repeat in the 5' 
      end of the FMR-1 gene, which causes the fragile X syndrome. The CGG repeat 
      distribution was found to be similar to that of other ethnic groups, as well as 
      to that of other nonhuman primates, possibly predicting a comparable prevalence 
      of fragile X in Africa. Significant linkage disequilibrium has been observed 
      between fragile X mutations and alleles of the DXS548 and FRAXAC1 loci in 
      European and Asian populations, and some founder chromosomes may be extremely 
      old. Those associated with FRAXAC1-A and DXS548-2 alleles are not present in the 
      Asian fragile X samples. We searched for these alleles and their frequency in the 
      well defined Bamileke population of Cameroon. All previously described alleles 
      and some new ones were found in this sample, supporting the hypothesis of their 
      pre-existence and subsequent loss in Asian populations. Finally, the 
      heterozygosity of the Bamileke sample was significantly higher at both marker 
      loci and comparable to that of Europeans at the CGG repeat, confirming the notion 
      that genetic diversity is greater in Africans than in other groups and supporting 
      the view that evolution of modern man started in Africa.

TI  - Fragile X syndrome in two siblings with major congenital malformations.
PG  - 396-400
AB  - We report on 2 brothers with both fragile X and VACTERL-H syndrome. The first 
      sibling, age 5, had bilateral cleft lip and palate, ventricular septal defect, 
      and a hypoplastic thumb. The second sibling, age 2 1/2, had a trachesophageal 
      fistula, esophageal atresia, and vertebral abnormality. High-resolution 
      chromosome analysis showed a 46, XY chromosome constitution in both siblings. By 
      PCR and Southern blot analysis, the siblings were found to have large triplet 
      repeat expansions in the fragile X gene (FMR 1) and both had methylation 
      mosaicism. Enzyme kinetic studies of iduronate sulfatase demonstrated a two-fold 
      increase in activity in the first sib as compared to the second. Possible 
      mechanisms through which the fragile X mutation can cause down-regulation of 
      adjacent loci are discussed.

PG  - 614-26
AB  - The FMR-1 gene for the human fragile-chi syndrome, a mental retardation disease 
      inherited by non-Mendelian transmission, contains a genetically unstable CGG 
      region in the 5' non-translated region. The severity of the disease is correlated 
      with the length of the CGG tract. The cloning of 28 stable plasmids containing 
      (CGG)n inserts (where n = 6 to 240) with different extents and types of sequence 
      interruptions (polymorphisms), and in different orientations was accomplished by 
      three strategies in Escherichia coli. Some shorter tracts were prepared by the 
      direct cloning of synthetic oligonucleotides, and longer runs were clones of 
      multimers of (CGG)61, (CGG)11AGG(CGG)60CAG(CGG)8, from a cDNA from a fragile-chi 
      patient or from expansions or deletions of these sequences in E. coli. The 
      genetic stability of the inserts, especially for the longer tracts, was dependent 
      on the sequence length, the presence of polymorphisms, the host cell genotypes, 
      the orientation of the inserts in the vector and the position of cloning in a 
      vector. Two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis studies on fully methylated 
      and on non-methylated plasmids as well as chemical probe studies revealed the 
      absence of underwound structures or accessible base-pairs. These DNAs enable a 
      range of genetic and biochemical investigations into the molecular basis of the 
      fragile-chi syndrome.

PG  - 109-13
AB  - Five folate-sensitive fragile sites have been identified at the molecular level 
      to date. Each is characterized by an expanded and methylated trinucleotide repeat 
      CGG (CCG). Of the three X chromosome sites, FRAXA, FRAXE and FRAXF, the former 
      two are associated with mental retardation in their expanded forms. FRAXA 
      expansion results in fragile X syndrome due to down regulation of expression of 
      the FMR1 gene, which carries the hypermutable CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated 
      portion of its first exon. Mild mental retardation without consistent physical 
      findings has been found associated with expanded CCG repeats at FRAXE. We have 
      identified a large gene (FMR2) transcribed distally from the CpG island at FRAXE, 
      and down-regulated by repeat expansion and methylation. The gene is novel, 
      expressed in adult brain and placenta, and shows similarity with another human 
      protein, MLLT2, expressed from a gene at chromosome 4q21 involved in 
      translocations found in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells. Identification 
      of this gene will facilitate further studies to determine the role of its product 
      in FRAXE associated mental deficiency.

PG  - 5041-53
AB  - Most models proposed to explain the disease-associated expansion of (CTG)n.(CAG)n 
      and (CGG)n.(CCG)n trinucleotide repeats include the formation of slipped strand 
      DNA structures during replication; however, physical evidence for these 
      alternative DNA secondary structures has not been reported. Using cloned 
      fragments from the myotonic dystrophy (DM) and fragile X syndrome (FRAXA) loci 
      containing normal, premutation, and full mutation lengths of repeats, we report 
      the formation of novel alternative DNA secondary structures that map within the 
      repeat tracts during reannealing of complementary strands, containing equal 
      lengths of repeats, into linear duplex DNA molecules. Linear duplex DNA molecules 
      containing these alternative DNA secondary structures are characterized by 
      reduced electrophoretic mobilities in polyacrylamide gels. These alternative 
      secondary structures are stable at physiological ionic strengths and to 
      temperatures up to at least 55 degrees C. Following reduplexing, the CAG strand 
      of the (CTG)n.(CAG)n repeats is preferentially sensitive to mung bean nuclease, 
      suggesting the presence of single-stranded DNA in the alternative DNA structure. 
      For (CTG)17, which is a repeat length found in normal individuals, less than 3% 
      of the DNA molecules formed alternative DNA structures upon reduplexing. DNA 
      molecules containing (CTG)50 or (CTG)255, which represent premutation and full 
      mutation lengths of triplet repeats, respectively, formed a heterogeneous 
      population of alternative DNA structures in >50% of DNA molecules. The complexity 
      of the structures formed increased with the length of the triplet repeat. The 
      relationship between repeat length and the propensity of formation and complexity 
      of the novel structures correlates with the effect of repeat length on genetic 
      instability in human diseases. These are the first results consistent with the 
      existence of slipped strand DNA structures. The potential involvement of these 
      structures, which we term S-DNA, in the gentic instability of triplet repeats is 
      discussed.

TI  - FMR1 in global populations.
PG  - 513-22
AB  - Fragile X syndrome, a frequent form of inherited mental retardation, results from 
      the unstable expansion of a cryptic CGG repeat within the 5' UTR region of the 
      FMR1 gene. The CGG repeat is normally polymorphic in length, and the content is 
      frequently interrupted by AGG triplets. These interruptions are believed to 
      stabilize the repeat, and their absence, leading to long tracts of perfect CGG 
      repeats, may give rise to predisposed alleles. In order to examine the stability 
      of normal FMR1 alleles, the repeat length of 345 chromosomes from nine global 
      populations was examined with the content also determined from 114 chromosomes as 
      assessed by automated DNA sequencing. The FMR1 alleles, defined by the CGG 
      repeat, as well as by the haplotypes of nearby polymorphic loci, were very 
      heterogeneous, although the level of variation correlated with the age and/or 
      genetic history of a particular population. Native American alleles, interrupted 
      by three AGG repeats, exhibited marked stability over 7,000 years. However, in 
      older African populations, parsimony analysis predicts the occasional loss of an 
      AGG, leading to more perfect CGG repeats. These data therefore support the 
      suggestion that AGG interruptions enhance the stability of the FMR1 repeat and 
      indicate that the rare loss of these interruptions leads to alleles with longer 
      perfect CGG-repeat tracts.

AB  - Autonomous expansions of trinucleotide repeats with the general structure 
      5'-d(CNG)n-3' are associated with several human genetic diseases. We have 
      characterized nuclear proteins binding to the unstable 5'-d(CGG)n-3' repeat. Its 
      expansion in the human FMR1 gene leads to the fragile X syndrome, one of the most 
      frequent causes of mental retardation in human males. Electrophoretic mobility 
      shift assays using nuclear extracts from several human and other mammalian cell 
      lines and from primary human cells demonstrated specific binding to 
      double-stranded DNA fragments containing only a 5'-d(CGG)17-3' repeat or the 
      repeat and flanking genomic sequences of the human FMR1 gene. Protein binding was 
      inhibited by complete methylation of the trinucleotide repeat. The complex formed 
      with crude nuclear extract apparently did not contain the human transcription 
      factor Sp1 that binds to a characteristic GC-rich sequence. A 20-kDa protein 
      involved in specific binding to the double-stranded 5'-d(CGG)17-3' repeat was 
      purified from HeLa nuclear extracts by DNA affinity chromatography.

      sequence in the FMR-1 gene. Molecular techniques enable the detection of the

      a protocol of analysis that combines a method of non-radioactive PCR, Southern 
      blotting and cytogenetic testing. This protocol can be used for screening 
      programme of selected groups of mentally retarded individuals and for prevention 
      studies in families at risk.

      syndrome family.
PG  - 8-12
AB  - The fragile X syndrome is the most frequent cause of inherited mental 
      retardation. CGG repeat alleles are usually classified as normal, premutation, or 
      full mutation based on the length of this triplet in the 5' untranslated region 
      of the FMR1 gene. The pattern of inheritance follows a two-stage 
      intergenerational process in which the premutation evolves into the full 
      mutation. Some reverse mutations have been described, but they appear to be very 
      rare. We describe a family in which a mother of two affected males herself 
      carried a full mutation. Surprisingly, her clinically normal daughter, initially 
      considered to be a carrier by linkage analysis, carried a very short premutation. 
      Findings from our family study corroborate the hypothesis that the expansion 
      during female transmission could be a postzygotic event and raise the problem of 
      mosaicism.

      associated with human disease genes.
PG  - 16125-31
AB  - Eight human genetic diseases have been associated with the expansion of CTG or 
      CGG triplet repeats. The molecular etiology behind expansion is unknown but may 
      involve participation of an unusual DNA structure in replication, repair, or 
      recombination. We show that DNA fragments containing CTG triplet repeats derived 
      from the human myotonic dystrophy gene migrate up to 20% faster than expected in 
      nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, suggesting the presence of an unusual DNA 
      helix structure within the CTG triplet repeats. The anomalous migration is 
      dependent upon the number of triplet repeats, the length of the flanking DNA, and 
      the percentage and temperature of the polyacrylamide. The effect could be reduced 
      by the addition of actinomycin D. Applying a reptation model for electrophoresis, 
      the results are consistent with a 20% increase in persistence length of the DNA. 
      PCR products containing CTG or CGG repeats from the spinocerebellar ataxia type I 
      gene (SCA1) or the fragile X FMR1 gene, respectively, also showed higher 
      electrophoretic mobility. These are the first sequences of defined length for 
      which a dramatic increase in mobility can be attributed to sequence-dependent 
      structural elements in DNA.

TI  - Population survey of the human FMR1 CGG repeat substructure suggests biased 
      polarity for the loss of AGG interruptions.
PG  - 2199-208
AB  - Both sequence length and sequence content are important parameters in determining 
      stability of the fragile X syndrome CGG repeat. In order to estimate the 
      incidence of uninterrupted CGG repeats in the general population and to gain 
      insight into mechanisms responsible for the loss and acquisition of AGG 
      interruptions, 406 randomly selected FMR1 CGG repeat alleles from four broad 
      ethnic groups were assayed for AGG punctuation. Among the 79 different classes of 
      alleles detected, long uninterrupted tracts of pure repeats were rare in the 
      general population, with only 1/406 or 0.25% found at the instability threshold 
      (34-37 pure CGG repeats). There was no significant difference (P>0.05) in the 
      distribution of alleles with long (>20) pure repeat tracts among the different 
      ethnic groups, suggesting that different ethnic groups should be equally 
      susceptible to the development of the disease. Analysis of an additional 43 
      alleles with total repeat lengths between 35 and 50 repeats, revealed that highly 
      interrupted CGG repeats alleles (>2 AGG interruptions) occur preferentially at 
      modal repeat lengths in the population, providing confirmatory evidence that the 
      presence of AGG interruptions confers stability. A consideration of length 
      variation of the most 3' tract of pure repeats revealed a bimodal distribution 
      pattern with maxima at approximately 10 and 20 repeats. Only unimodal 
      distributions with maxima 9 or 10 were observed for the 5' tract and middle CGG 
      tract within the FMR1 CGG repeat substructure. These results suggest that the 
      loss of the most 3' AGG interruption or its conversion to CGG is a common event 
      in the human population, occurring by a mechanism which preserves overall repeat 
      length. This bias for loss of the distal-most AGG interruption likely plays an 
      important part in predisposing human alleles to the development of the X 
      syndrome.

TI  - The fragile X syndrome single strand d(CGG)n nucleotide repeats readily fold back 
      to form unimolecular hairpin structures.
PG  - 28970-7
AB  - Expansion of a d(CGG)n run within the 5'-untranslated region of the X-linked 
      human gene FMR1 blocks FMR1 transcription, delays its replication, and 
      precipitates the fragile X syndrome. We showed previously that d(CGG)n tracts 
      aggregate into interstrand tetrahelical complexes (Fry, M., and Loeb, L. A. 
      (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 4950-4954). Here we show that these 
      sequences also form under physiological conditions in in vitro unimolecular 
      hairpin structures. Folding is demonstrated by temperature-dependent mobility of 
      d(CGG)n oligomers in a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, by UV-hyperchromicity of 
      thermally denaturing oligomers, and by UV cross-linking of compact forms of 
      d(CGG)n runs interspersed by thymidine clusters. That the compact d(CGG)n 
      structures are unimolecular is suggested by their zero-order kinetics of 
      formation. Diethyl pyrocarbonate modification reveals a single, 4-5 residue-long 
      central or epicentral unpaired loop in folded d(CGG)n oligomers. The position of 
      this loop remains unchanged by insertion of thymidine clusters into 15- or 33-mer 
      d(CGG) tracts as indicated by KMnO4 probing of unpaired thymidines. The presence 
      of a single loop in folded d(CGG)n oligomers and the accessibility of every 
      guanine to dimethyl sulfate modification suggest that they are hairpin and not 
      tetraplex structures. Modeling indicates that different d(CGG)n hairpins are 
      stabilized by guanine-guanine Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds or by Hoogsteen and 
      Watson-Crick bonds. If formed in vivo, d(CGG)n hairpins could entail slippage and 
      trinucleotide expansion during replication and could obstruct FMR1 gene 
      transcription and replication.

TI  - Normal phenotype in two brothers with a full FMR1 mutation.
PG  - 2103-8
AB  - The fragile X syndrome is associated with an expanding CGG repeat in the 5' 
      untranslated region of the first exon of the FMR1 gene. Subsequent methylation of 
      the promoter region inhibits expression of the FMR1 gene. In two clinically 
      normal brothers large, expanded CGG repeats and cytogenetically visible fragile 
      sites were found. The FMR1 promoter was unmethylated and both RNA and protein 
      could be detected. This indicates that inactivation of the FMR1 gene and not 
      repeat expansion itself results in the fragile X phenotype. We conclude that 
      repeat expansion does not necessarily induce methylation and that methylation is 
      no absolute requirement for the induction of fragile sites.

TI  - Contribution of the FMR1 gene mutation to human intellectual dysfunction.
PG  - 331-4
AB  - The degree to which genetic factors influence human intelligence remains a matter 
      of some controversy. However, there is little doubt that single gene mutations 
      can significantly alter brain development and function. For example, mutations 
      affecting the FMR1 gene cause the fragile X syndrome, the most prevalent known 
      inherited cause of intellectual dysfunction. The most common mutation occurring 
      in the FMR1 locus involves expansion of a trinucleotide (CGG)n repeat sequence 
      within the promoter region of the gene. Between 6 and 54 repeats are typically 
      observed in individuals from the general population. When > or = 200 CGG repeats 
      are present, the expanded repeat sequence and an adjacent CpG island are usually 
      hypermethylated, Aa phenomenon associated with transcriptional silencing of the 
      gene and commonly referred to as the FMR1 full mutation. The intermediate range 
      of repeats (approximately 50 to 200 CGGs), referred to as the premutation, is 
      characterized by the absence of hypermethylation within the promoter region and 
      normal phenotype. Some individuals have a combination of methylated and 
      unmethylated alleles of differing size and are referred to as having mosaic 
      status. Most males with the FMR1 full mutation function in the mentally retarded 
      range of intelligence; in contrast, females with the FMR1 full mutation show a 
      broader range of intelligence, from mental retardation to normal IQ.(ABSTRACT

AB  - The fragile X(A) or FRAXA syndrome is the most common form of familial mental 
      retardation and is associated with a fragile site at Xq27.3. The gene responsible 
      for the FRAXA syndrome, the FMR1 gene, has been cloned. inactivation of the FMR1 
      gene is associated with amplification of a trinucle-otide CGG repeat sequence and 
      methylation of an adjacent CpG island. Previous estimates for the prevalence of 
      the FRAXA syndrome have been based on indirect methods of chromosome analysis in 
      institutions and community workshops for the mentally handicapped. We have 
      analyzed the frequency of premutations of the FMR1 gene in 3002 X chromosomes of 
      1000 male and 1000 female consecutive newborn nonautoclaved blood spots in an 
      anonymous, unlinked survey. The CGG repeat sizes were calculated by measuring the 
      length of products of the PCR reaction based on the molecular size of labeled 
      markers in a denaturing sequencing gel assay. For consistent PCR amplification a 
      DNA microextraction was necessary, including a phenol/chloroform series. In our 
      population, the CGG allele ranged from 9 to 106 repeats: 97% of alleles had fewer 
      than 40 repeats. The most frequent allele was a repeat of 28. Approximately 2.3% 
      of alleles had CGG repeats ranging from 4 to 49 and 0.37% of alleles had repeats 
      ranging from 50 to 59. The frequency of alleles > 60 repeats in the Manitoba male 
      population is approximately 0.13%. The use of nonautoclaved Guthrie blood spots 
      for population screening of FRAXA premutations is not recommended. The necessity 
      of a phenol/chloroform DNA microextraction is tedious and time consuming. The low 
      yield of DNA (250 ng) does not allow for reanalysis by Southern of apparently 
      homozygous females with potentially unstable CGG alleles in the 40-60 repeat 
      range and likely underestimates premutation carrier status.

TI  - Non-radioactive DNA diagnosis for the fragile X syndrome in mentally retarded 
      Japanese males.
PG  - 317-21; discussion 323-4
AB  - A rapid screening test was developed to detect CGG repeat expansion of the FMR-1 
      gene causing the fragile X syndrome by a non-radioisotope PCR technique. A 
      biotin-labeled primer was initially used and the biotin-labeled PCR product was 
      detected by means of chemiluminescence. The normal PCR product of around 300 bp 
      was not created in the abnormal FMR-1 gene sample with this method. Four positive 
      samples were found among those from 226 mentally retarded males, but the CGG 
      repeat expansion was shown on Southern blot analysis in only one sample. To 
      eliminate false-positive samples, a hybridization method involving a 
      biotin-labeled (CGG)s oligonucleotide was developed for the PCR product and the 
      CGG repeat expansion could be detected. Finally, 256 mentally retarded males in 
      Japan were examined and only 2 abnormal samples were detected. The prevalence of 
      this abnormality was less than 1%, which is relatively lower than those reported 
      previously.

TI  - Prenatal diagnosis of fragile X syndrome: (CGG)n expansion and methylation of 
      chorionic villus samples.
PG  - 801-7
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental retardation, due 
      to an expansion of the (CGG)n trinucleotide repeat in the FMR-1 gene and 
      hypermethylation of its 5' upstream CpG island. Two major problems remain to be 
      resolved for fragile X prenatal diagnosis: the abnormal methylation patterns of 
      chorionic villus samples (CVS) and the inability to predict the mental status of 
      females with the full mutation. We present here the results of ten prenatal 
      diagnoses of fragile X syndrome using Southern blotting and polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) amplification, and the analysis of 50 further CVS to test the 
      methylation status of the CpG island of the FMR-1 gene. In the ten 'at-risk' CVS, 
      eight normal (five males and three females) and two affected male fetuses were 
      detected. Absence of methylation in the CVS was observed in two cases, which was 
      not found upon subsequent examination of the newborn or of fetal tissues. In the 
      50 CVS not 'at risk' for fragile X syndrome, abnormal fragment patterns for probe 
      StB12.3 were detected in 32 per cent for female and 24 per cent for male fetuses. 
      This abnormal pattern could be due to absent or partial methylation of the CpG 
      island of the FMR-1 gene in chorionic villus tissues.

TI  - FRAXE expansion is not a common etiological factor among developmentally delayed 
      males.
PG  - 72-6
AB  - Expansion of a (CGG)n trinucleotide repeat unit at FRAXE, a newly defined fragile 
      site distal to FRAXA, at Xq28, is reported to be associated with mild mental 
      retardation. Three hundred developmentally delayed male patients referred for 
      fragile X testing but negative for the FMR-1 gene trinucleotide expansion were 
      screened for the FRAXE expansion. This group of patients had a wide range of 
      intellectual or behavioral problems and included 19 patients who had low-level 
      fragile site expression detected cytogenetically at Xq27-q28. None of the 
      patients tested positive for the FRAXE expansion. These results suggest that 
      FRAXE is not a common etiological factor among this group of patients. The data 
      support the hypothesis that FRAXE is either very rare or a benign fragile site 
      that is not associated with any clinical phenotype, similar to the FRAXF and 
      FRA16A sites.

TI  - Hairpins are formed by the single DNA strands of the fragile X triplet repeats: 
      structure and biological implications.
PG  - 5199-203
AB  - Inordinate expansion and hypermethylation of the fragile X DNA triplet repeat, 
      (GGC)n.(GCC)n, are correlated with the ability of the individual G- and C-rich 
      single strands to form hairpin structures. Two-dimensional NMR and gel 
      electrophoresis studies show that both the G- and C-rich single strands form 
      hairpins under physiological conditions. This propensity of hairpin formation is 
      more pronounced for the C-rich strand than for the G-rich strand. This 
      observation suggests that the C-rich strand is more likely to form hairpin or 
      "slippage" structure and show asymmetric strand expansion during replication. NMR 
      data also show that the hairpins formed by the C-rich strands fold in such a way 
      that the cytosine at the CpG step of the stem is C.C paired. The presence of a 
      C.C mismatch at the CpG site generates local flexibility, thereby providing 
      analogs of the transition to the methyltransferase. In other words, the hairpins 
      of the C-rich strand act as better substrates for the human methyltransferase 
      than the Watson-Crick duplex or the G-rich strand. Therefore, hairpin formation 
      could account for the specific methylation of the CpG island in the fragile X 
      repeat that occurs during inactivation of the FMR1 gene during the onset of the 
      disease.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeats that expand in human disease form hairpin structures in 
      vitro.
PG  - 533-40
AB  - We show that repeating units from all reported disease genes are capable of 
      forming hairpins of common structure and threshold stability. The threshold 
      stability is roughly -50 kcal per hairpin and is influenced by the flanking 
      sequence of the gene. Hairpin stability has two components, sequence and length; 
      only DNA of select sequences and the correct length can form hairpins of 
      threshold energy. There is a correlation among the ability to form hairpins of 
      threshold stability, the sequence selectivity of expansion, and the length 
      dependence of expansion. Additionally, hairpin formation provides a potential 
      structural basis for the constancy of the CCG region of the Huntington's disease 
      gene in individuals and explains the stabilizing effects of AGG interruptions in 
      FMR1 alleles.

TI  - Translational suppression by trinucleotide repeat expansion at FMR1.
PG  - 731-4
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the result of the unstable expansion of a trinucleotide 
      repeat in the 5'-untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. Fibroblast subclones from 
      a mildly affected patient, each containing stable FMR1 alleles with 57 to 285 CGG 
      repeats, were shown to exhibit normal steady-state levels of FMR1 messenger RNA. 
      However, FMR protein was markedly diminished from transcript with more than 200 
      repeats. Such transcripts were associated with stalled 40S ribosomal subunits. 
      These results suggest that a structural RNA transition beyond 200 repeats impedes 
      the linear 40S migration along the 5'-untranslated region. This results in 
      translational inhibition by trinucleotide repeat expansion.

TI  - A rapid, non-radioactive screening test for fragile X mutations at the FRAXA and

PG  - 170-3
AB  - Screening of referrals for the mutations associated with the fragile X syndrome 
      constitutes a significant workload in many genetics laboratories. Since the great 
      majority of these referrals will be negative, there is a need for a rapid and 
      inexpensive screening test. We have developed an assay which allows simultaneous 
      amplification of the triplet repeat sequences at the FRAXA and FRAXE loci by 
      polymerase chain reaction, and detection of the products on non-denaturing gels 
      stained with ethidium bromide. Alleles of normal size are detected, leaving a 
      small minority of samples to be tested by Southern blotting. A PCR based assay 
      for detection of methylation at the CpG island upstream of the FMR-1 gene has 
      also been devised.

PG  - 157-60
AB  - Patients diagnosed using DSM-III-R criteria as having schizophrenia and other 
      related disorders (n = 128) were assessed for CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR-1) gene. One subject, a woman with 
      schizophreniform disorder, was found to have a premutation of the gene. Her case 
      report is given. The present investigation supports the view that mutation or 
      premutation of the FMR-1 gene is not of importance for the aetiology of the vast 
      majority of schizophrenic patients.

TI  - Quantitative comparison of FMR1 gene expression in normal and premutation 
      alleles.
PG  - 106-13
AB  - We report studies on FMR1 gene expression in cells derived from male premutation 
      carriers. Transcription of FMR1 genes with CGG-repeat lengths within the 
      premutation range was demonstrated to be normal. Repeat lengths are faithfully 
      transcribed into FMR1 mRNAs, which have steady-state levels, as measured by RNase 
      protection, similar to those of normal cells. Premutation transcripts also are 
      shown to have normal turnover, with the FMR1 mRNA half-life estimated to be 12 h. 
      Measurement of FMR1 protein was also found to be in similar abundance in normal 
      and premutation cell lines. These data support the nonpenetrant status of 
      premutation carriers of fragile X syndrome and suggest that the occasional case 
      reports to the contrary may reflect either other causes, including low-level 
      mosaicism for larger, methylated FMR1 alleles, or simply coincidence.

TI  - DNA testing for fragile X syndrome in schools for learning difficulties.
PG  - 33-7
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation. 
      Early diagnosis is important not only for appropriate management of individuals 
      but also to identify carriers who are unaware of their high risk of having an 
      affected child. The disorder is associated with a cytogenetically visible fragile 
      site (FRAXA) at Xq27.3, caused by amplification of a (CGG)n repeat sequence 
      within the gene at this locus designated FMR1. Clinical and molecular studies 
      have been undertaken to screen for fragile X syndrome in 154 children with 
      moderate and severe learning difficulties of previously unknown origin. Southern 
      blot analysis of peripheral blood showed the characteristic abnormally large 
      (CGG)n repeat sequence associated with fragile X syndrome in four of the 154 
      children. The findings were confirmed by cytogenetic observation of the fragile 
      site and by further molecular studies. The families of the affected children were 
      offered genetic counselling and DNA tests to determine their carrier status. 
      These findings show that there are still unrecognised cases of fragile X 
      syndrome. Given the difficulty of making a clinical diagnosis and the 
      implications for families when the diagnosis is missed, screening in high risk 
      populations may be justified. The issues involved in screening all children in 
      special schools for fragile X syndrome are discussed.

TI  - The cloning of FRAXF: trinucleotide repeat expansion and methylation at a third 
      fragile site in distal Xqter.
PG  - 2115-21
AB  - Three fragile sites, FRAXA, FRAXE and FRAXF lie in the Xq27-28 region of the 
      human X chromosome. The expression of FRAXA is associated with the fragile X 
      syndrome, the most prevalent form of inherited mental retardation whilst the 
      expression of FRAXE is associated with a rarer and comparatively milder form of 
      mental handicap. Both the FRAXA and FRAXE sites have been cloned and the fragile 
      site expression found to be due to the expansion of analogous CGG/GCC 
      trinucleotide repeat arrays. We describe here the cloning of the third fragile 
      site, FRAXF, and demonstrate that it involves the expansion of a (GCCGTC)n(GCC)n 
      compound array. PCR analyses across the repeat of normal individuals show that 
      the number of triplets in the array ranges from 12-26 and the most common allele 
      consists of 14 triplet units. Sequencing analyses show that 95% of normal 
      individuals have three copies of the GCCGTC motif and in these individuals, the 
      size variation observed by PCR is due to copy number alterations in the GCC 
      array. In a cytogenetically positive male with developmental delay, the array is 
      expanded by > 900 triplets and the adjacent CpG-rich region is methylated. The 
      array is also expanded in cytogenetically positive carrier females from the 
      family originally used to define the FRAXF site. We conclude that the expanded 
      array corresponds to the FRAXF fragile site.

TI  - Molecular analysis of 53 fragile X families with the probe StB12.3.
PG  - 370-3
AB  - Fifty-three pedigrees with the fragile X syndrome have been studied for 
      amplification of the CGG repeat sequence adjacent to the CpG island in the FMR1 
      gene. Probe StB12.3 allowed direct detection of affected males, carrier females, 
      normal transmitting males, as well as prenatal diagnosis. Comparison of our 
      molecular data with our previous linkage data from 38 families indicates the 
      effectiveness of direct DNA analysis. A total of 325 individuals were studied and 
      no new mutation was found. All daughters of males with a premutation had a 
      premutation. When the mother had a full mutation no children had a premutation. 
      In premutated mothers, the size of the premutation seems to be a determining 
      factor for the transition to the full mutation. All affected males had a full 
      mutation or mosaicism and only 42% of the females with a full mutation were 
      mentally impaired. Analysis of large families over 3 generations illustrated 
      clearly the Sherman paradox. Furthermore, the analysis of these families is in 
      reasonable agreement with the multiallelic model of Morton and Macpherson [Proc 
      Natl Acad Sci USA 89:4215-4217, 1992]. Mosaic cases in the offspring of the 
      mothers with a full mutation suggest a maternal germinal mosaicism. Then an 
      abnormal methylation and a somatic heterogeneity established in very early steps 
      of embryogenesis could explain these cases.

TI  - Molecular analysis of the (CGG)n expansion in the FMR-1 gene in 59 Spanish 
      fragile X syndrome families.
PG  - 395-400
AB  - The fragile X mental retardation syndrome is caused by an expansion of a 
      trinucleotide repeat (CGG)n in the FMR-1 gene. Molecular genetic study of fragile 
      X provides accurate diagnosis and facilitates genetic counseling in families with 
      affected members. We present here the molecular study of 59 Spanish fragile X 
      syndrome families using probe StB 12.3 and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of 
      the (CGG)n repeat sequence of the FMR-1 gene. The results obtained have allowed 
      us to characterize 455 individuals, including eight prenatal diagnoses. The 
      clinical diagnosis of fragile X in 89 affected males was confirmed, 137 female 
      carriers were identified (48 of whom were mentally retarded), 176 individuals "at 
      risk" were found not to have the expansion, and 12 cases of normal transmitting 
      males (NTM) were detected. In the sample studied, no de novo mutations were 
      detected, nor any mutation different from that described for the (CGG)n 
      expansion. One nonmentally retarded male was detected as having an unmethylated 
      CpG island for the FMR-1 gene, but with more than 200 CGG repeats (high 
      functioning male). The analysis of the (CGG)n repeat in 208 normal chromosomes 
      gave an allele distribution similar to that in other Caucasoid population groups, 
      with alleles of 29 and 30 CGG repeats accounting for 46% of the chromosomes. The 
      combination of Southern analysis and PCR of the (CGG)n repeat is highly efficient 
      for diagnosis, compared with cytogenetic techniques, especially in the detection 
      of female carriers, NTMs, and prenatal diagnosis, enabling accurate genetic 
      counseling to be provided in all cases.

TI  - Loss of mutation at the FMR1 locus through multiple exchanges between maternal X 
      chromosomes.
PG  - 1823-7
AB  - The mutation observed in the fragile X syndrome, an X-linked inherited disorder 
      causing mental retardation, is almost exclusively an expanded CGG repeat in the 
      first exon of the FMR1 gene. Here we describe a daughter of a female carrier, who 
      inherited the fragile X premutation chromosome based on haplotype analysis using 
      flanking markers. However, the CGG repeat sequence and the intragenic polymorphic 
      marker FMRb showed the normal maternal alleles, while two other intragenic 
      markers, FMRa and FRAXAC2 and other, more distant markers, showed the risk 
      haplotype. Since FMRa and FRAXAC2 are located in between the markers CGG and 
      FMRb, this results in patches of normal and fragile X sequences in the FMR1 gene 
      of the daughter. This observation is very likely due to gene conversion. As this 
      daughter received a normal CGG repeat region, we expect that her risk to have 
      affected offspring is the same as the population risk. The observed phenomenon 
      would therefore represent a back mutation at the FMR1 locus.

TI  - Length of uninterrupted CGG repeats determines instability in the FMR1 gene.
PG  - 88-94
AB  - Analysis of 84 human X chromosomes for the presence of interrupting AGG 
      trinucleotides within the CGG repeat tract of the FMR1 gene revealed that most 
      alleles possess two interspersed AGGs and that the longest tract of uninterrupted 
      CGG repeats is usually found at the 3' end. Variation in the length of the repeat 
      appears polar. Alleles containing between 34 and 55 repeats, with documented 
      unstable transmissions, were shown to have lost one or both AGG interruptions. 
      These comparisons define an instability threshold of 34-38 uninterrupted CGG 
      repeats. Analysis of premutation alleles in Fragile X syndrome carriers reveals 
      that 70% of these alleles contain a single AGG interruption. These data suggest 
      that the loss of an AGG is an important mutational event in the generation of 
      unstable alleles predisposed to the Fragile X syndrome.

TI  - Triplet repeat expansion at the FRAXE locus and X-linked mild mental handicap.
PG  - 81-6
AB  - We have recently shown that the expression of the FRAXE fragile site in Xq28 is 
      associated with the expansion of a GCC trinucleotide repeat. In the families 
      studied, FRAXE expression is also associated with mild mental handicap. Here we 
      present data on families that previously had been diagnosed as having the fragile 
      X syndrome but that later were found to be negative for trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion at the FRAXA locus. In these families we demonstrate the presence of a 
      GCC trinucleotide repeat expansion at the FRAXE locus. Studies of the FRAXE locus 
      of normal individuals show that they have 6-25 copies of the repeat, whereas 
      affected individuals have > 200 copies. As in the fragile X syndrome, the 
      amplified CpG residues are methylated in affected males.

TI  - The fragile X syndrome d(CGG)n nucleotide repeats form a stable tetrahelical 
      structure.
PG  - 4950-4
AB  - The fragile X mental retardation syndrome is associated with the expansion of 
      trinucleotide 5'-d(CGG)-3' repeats within the FMR1 gene and with hypermethylation 
      of the cytosine residues of these repeats. The expansion and hypermethylation may 
      account for the suppression of the transcription of the FMR1 gene and for the 
      delay of its replication during the cell cycle. Here we show that d(CGG)n 
      oligomers can form a stable Hoogsteen-bonded structure that exhibits properties 
      consistent with those of tetraplex DNA. Oligomers, d(mCGG)n, (n = 4, 5, or 7), at 
      pH 8.0 and in the presence of an alkali metal ion form stable species exhibiting 
      a reduced electrophoretic mobility in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. These 
      species are denatured by heating at 90 degrees C for 10 min. With a short 
      d(mCGG)5 oligomer, the slowly migrating species is formed only when the cytosine 
      residue is 5-methylated, whereas with the longer d(CGG)7 it is generated whether 
      or not cytosine is 5-methylated. By contrast, complementary cytosine-rich 
      oligomers do not form analogous complexes. The second-order association kinetics 
      of the formation of the slowly migrating species of d(mCGG)5 suggests that it is 
      an interstrand complex. Formation of intermediate-size complexes between d(mCGG)5 
      and d(mCGG)7 indicates that the stoichiometry of the slowly migrating structures 
      is tetramolecular. Protection of the complex from methylation by dimethyl sulfate 
      indicates the involvement of the N-7 positions of the guanine residues in 
      Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, a characteristic of quadruplex structures. If formed 
      in vivo along the expanded and hypermethylated d(mCGG)n stretch, this tetraplex 
      structure could suppress transcription and replication of the FMR1 gene in the 
      fragile X syndrome cells.

AB  - The recent observation that the mutation underlying a number of genetic diseases 
      including fragile sites, FRAXA and FRAXE (associated with mental retardation), 
      myotonic dystrophy, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy's disease), 
      Huntington's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 are caused by the 
      expansion of a trinucleotide repeat sequence will lead to interest in the 
      identification of such sequences in regions related to other diseases. We report 
      here the identification of all ten classes of trinucleotide repeats within a 2 
      Mbp region of 4p16.3 containing the Huntington's disease (HD) gene. Fifty one 
      triplet repeats were identified and localised on a high resolution restriction 
      map of a cosmid contig covering this region. This included the triplet repeat 
      (CAG)n, which has subsequently been shown to be expanded in Huntington's disease 
      patients.

TI  - A complex mutable polymorphism located within the fragile X gene.
PG  - 248-53
AB  - While studying founder chromosomes in the fragile X syndrome, we have 
      unexpectedly found linkage equilibrium to FRAXAC2, an Alu-associated 
      microsatellite within the defective gene, FMR-1. DNA sequencing of 265 
      chromosomes revealed 39 alleles and a complex microsatellite of form 
      (GT)x-C-(TA)y-(T)z. A mutation rate of 3.3% was observed but only among fragile X 
      maternally derived meioses. Finding a second mutable locus within FMR-1 suggests 
      that the target for tandem repeat instability may not be confined to the (CGG)n 
      repeat alone and raises the possibility of an FMR-1 mutation mechanism involving 
      microsatellites.

TI  - Data on the CGG repeat at the fragile X site in the non-retarded Japanese 
      population and family suggest the presence of a subgroup of normal alleles 
      predisposing to mutate.
PG  - 431-6
AB  - The fragile X mutation is the result of amplification in the repeat number of 
      p(CGG)n in FMR-1; alleles with more than 52 repeats have been shown to be so 
      unstable as to mutate in the repeat number in almost every transmission. To 
      improve our understanding of mutations in normal alleles of FMR-1, the following 
      studies were carried out in the Japanese population: a study on length variation 
      in the repeat to determine the allele distribution of the repeat length in a 
      non-retarded population, family studies to observe new mutations in normal 
      allele, and haplotype analyses with microsatellite markers flanking the repeat to 
      confirm estimated mutation rates and founder chromosomes in the fragile X 
      syndrome. Analysis of the p(CGG)n in 370 unrelated males detected 24 distinct 
      alleles with repeats of 18-44. A comparison with previously reported data 
      suggests the presence of racial/ethnic differences in the allele distribution. No 
      premutation allele was found in 824 unrelated X chromosomes examined by the 
      polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis. Family studies detected one 
      new mutation in a total of 303 meioses. However, the mutation rate was not in 
      accordance with the expected or observed heterozygosities in the population or 
      with linkage disequilibrium observed between the repeat numbers and the 
      haplotypes of the markers flanking the CGG. The haplotype in the chromosome in 
      which the new mutation was found was the same as that frequently found in the 
      Japanese fragile X chromosomes, and the variance in the CGG repeat number was 
      wider in chromosomes with the haplotypes frequently found in the fragile X 
      chromosome than in those with the other haplotypes. These observations suggest 
      that a subgroup is present in normal alleles and that this subgroup is more 
      liable to mutate than others.

TI  - A study of the physical, behavioral, and medical phenotype, including 
      anthropometric measures, of females with fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 1236-41
AB  - The physical features of fragile X, including a long face, prominent ears, and 
      hyperextensible joints, are present in affected males and females. 
      Cytogenetically negative heterozygotes have been considered to be unaffected by 
      the fragile X mental retardation-1 (FMR-1) gene. This study investigated the 
      penetrance of the FMR-1 gene in cytogenetically negative but DNA-positive 
      heterozygotes with a premutation (cytosine guanine guanine [CGG] amplification in 
      the 50 to 200 repeat range), compared with carriers with a full mutation (> 200 
      CGG repeats) and control subjects. One hundred thirty-nine women with normal IQs 
      between the ages of 18 and 45 years were studied. All underwent cytogenetic and 
      DNA testing to determine their fragile X carrier status. A medical history-taking 
      and a physical examination, including selected anthropometric measurements, were 
      performed. Results indicate that the FMR-1 mutation mildly affects the physical 
      phenotype of individuals even in the premutation state, although less 
      dramatically than more affected heterozygotes. Carriers with a premutation 
      differed significantly from control subjects in overall physical index score and 
      in the anthropometric measure of ear prominence. These results suggest a 
      phenotypic impact of the FMR-1 mutation even at the 50 to 200 CGG repeat length.

PG  - 491-8
AB  - Molecular genetic analysis of the transmission of mutations in 73 families with 
      fragile X (one of the largest samples evaluated so far) has confirmed previous 
      hypotheses that the fragile X syndrome results from two consecutive mutational 
      steps, designated "premutation" and "full fragile X mutation". These mutations 
      give rise to expansions of restriction fragments, most probably by amplification 
      of the FMR-1 CGG repeat. Premutations are identified by small expansions that 
      apparently have no effect on either the clinical or the cellular phenotype. Full 
      mutations are reflected by large expansions and hypermethylation of the expanded 
      gene region. All males showing large expansions were affected. Individuals with 
      full mutations also expressed the fragile X, with only one exception. An affected 
      "mosaic" male, showing a predominance of premutated fragments in his leukocytes, 
      was shown to be fragile-X-negative on different occasions. About 50% of 
      heterozygotes with full mutations were reported by clinicians to be mentally 
      retarded. Conversion of the premutation to the full mutation may occur at 
      oogenesis, as previously suggested, or after formation of a zygote at an early 
      transitional stage in development when the CGG repeat behaves as a mitotically 
      unstable element on maternally derived/imprinted X chromosomes carrying a 
      premutation of sufficient repeat length.

PG  - 563-6
AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the result of transcriptional suppression of the gene FMR1 
      as a result of a trinucleotide repeat expansion mutation. The normal function of 
      the FMR1 protein (FMRP) and the mechanism by which its absence leads to mental 
      retardation are unknown. Ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) domains were identified 
      within FMRP, and RNA was shown to bind in stoichiometric ratios, which suggests 
      that there are two RNA binding sites per FMRP molecule. FMRP was able to bind to 
      its own message with high affinity (dissociation constant = 5.7 nM) and 
      interacted with approximately 4 percent of human fetal brain messages. The 
      absence of the normal interaction of FMRP with a subset of RNA molecules might 
      result in the pleiotropic phenotype associated with fragile X syndrome.

TI  - Fragile X syndrome unstable element, p(CCG)n, and other simple tandem repeat 
      sequences are binding sites for specific nuclear proteins.
PG  - 1429-35
AB  - The trinucleotide repeat sequences which become unstable in fragile X syndrome 
      and myotonic dystrophy are located in the untranslated regions of their 
      respective genes, FMR1 and DM1. This implies that a functional constraint other 
      than coding capacity maintains the presence of the repeats. In the case of 
      fragile X syndrome, sequences adjacent to the repeat are methylated in affected 
      individuals and the FMR1 gene is transcriptionally inactive. We demonstrate that 
      the fragile X p(CCG)n repeat itself is methylated in vivo and that methylation of 
      this repeat is able to inhibit in vitro binding of a novel, specific nuclear 
      p(CCG)n binding protein (CCG-BP1)--one of at least 10 distinct simple tandem 
      repeat sequence binding proteins (STR-BPs). We describe additional, apparently 
      distinct, binding activities both for the methylated form of the p(CCG)n repeat 
      and for each of the single strands of the repeat.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat amplification and hypermethylation of a CpG island in FRAXE 
      mental retardation.
PG  - 127-34
AB  - We have cloned the fragile site FRAXE and demonstrate that individuals with this 
      fragile site possess amplifications of a GCC repeat adjacent to a CpG island in 
      Xq28 of the human X chromosome. Normal individuals have 6-25 copies of the GCC 
      repeat, whereas mentally retarded, FRAXE-positive individuals have > 200 copies 
      and also have methylation at the CpG island. This situation is similar to that 
      seen at the FRAXA locus and is another example in which a trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion is associated with a human genetic disorder. In contrast with the 
      fragile X syndrome, the GCC repeat can expand or contract and is equally unstable 
      when passed through the male or female line. These results also have implications 
      for the understanding of chromosome fragility.

TI  - A microdeletion of less than 250 kb, including the proximal part of the FMR-I 
      gene and the fragile-X site, in a male with the clinical phenotype of fragile-X 
      syndrome.
PG  - 299-306
AB  - A gene designated "FMR-1" has been isolated at the fragile-X locus. One exon of 
      this gene is carried on a 5.1-kb EcoRI fragment that exhibits length variation in 
      fragile-X patients because of amplification of or insertion into a CGG-repeat 
      sequence. This repeat probably represents the fragile site. The EcoRI fragment 
      also includes an HTF island that is hypermethylated in fragile-X patients showing 
      absence of FMR-1 mRNA. In this paper, we present further evidence that the FMR-1 
      gene is involved in the clinical manifestation of the fragile-X syndrome and also 
      in the expression of the cellular phenotype. A deletion including the HTF island 
      and exons of the FMR-1 gene was detected in a fragile X-negative mentally 
      retarded male who presented the clinical phenotype of the fragile-X syndrome. The 
      deletion involves less than 250 kb of genomic DNA, including DXS548 and at least 
      five exons of the FMR-1 gene. These data support the hypothesis that loss of 
      function of the FMR-1 gene leads to the clinical phenotype of the fragile-X 
      syndrome. In the fragile-X syndrome, there are pathogenetic mechanisms other than 
      amplification of the CGG repeat that do have the same phenotypic consequences.

TI  - Parental origin of the fra(X) gene is a major determinant of the cytogenetic 
      expression and the CGG repeat length in female carriers.
PG  - 261-7
AB  - The fragile X [fra(X)] syndrome is the most frequent form of inherited mental 
      retardation, and co-segregates with a fragile site at Xq27.3 as well as with 
      insertion of a variable number of trinucleotide repeats in the 5'-end of the 
      FMR-1 gene. As the fra(X) gene is transmitted by females as well as males, we 
      have investigated whether the parental origin of the fra(X) gene has an effect 
      upon the cytogenetic expression and CGG repeat length. An increased fragment 
      length of 0.2-0.6 kb appeared to be associated with a very low expression or even 
      complete absence of the fragile site as well as with a normal phenotype, and was 
      seen mostly in cases of paternal inheritance. However, in most female carriers 
      with the maternally inherited fra(X) gene we found dispersed fragments ranging 
      from 1.4-6.5 kb or even complete absence of a hybridization signal. Within the 
      group of female carriers with the maternally inherited fra(X) gene we found a 
      statistically significant correlation between the level of the cytogenetic 
      expression and the PstI restriction fragment length encompassing the CGG repeat. 
      These data can be taken as indirect evidence that CGG repeat length and 
      cytogenetic expression are causally related.

TI  - Molecular studies of the fragile X syndrome.
PG  - 217-23
AB  - We have studied families segregating for the fragile X syndrome for the presence 
      of amplification of the CGG repeat sequence adjacent to the HpaII Tiny Fragment 
      (HTF) island in the FMR-1 gene. We demonstrate that 138/143 fragile X positive, 
      mentally retarded males show a characteristic smear of fragments corresponding to 
      somatic variation in the amplification of the CGG sequence. In 7/8 normal 
      transmitting males (NTM's), we show that there is a small amplification of 
      sequence but no evidence for somatic variation. Defined mutated fragments in the 
      size range found in NTM's are seen in daughters of NTM's. The daughters of these 
      female carriers show either a defined fragment in the NTM size range, a defined 
      larger fragment or a heterogeneous pattern of fragments. In the latter 2 cases 
      the clinical phenotype of the females cannot easily be predicted, presumably 
      because of variable X inactivation. In some families, the observed DNA genotype 
      does not correlate with the phenotype; in others we demonstrate the occurrence of 
      individuals with a mosaic DNA genotype. The implications of these data for 
      diagnosis of the disease are discussed.
