AB  - Expansions of amino acid repeats occur in >20 inherited human disorders, and many 
      occur in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of transcription factors (TFs). 
      Such diseases are associated with protein aggregation, but the contribution of 
      aggregates to pathology has been controversial. Here, we report that alanine 
      repeat expansions in the HOXD13 TF, which cause hereditary synpolydactyly in 
      humans, alter its phase separation capacity and its capacity to co-condense with 
      transcriptional co-activators. HOXD13 repeat expansions perturb the composition 
      of HOXD13-containing condensates in vitro and in vivo and alter the 
      transcriptional program in a cell-specific manner in a mouse model of 
      synpolydactyly. Disease-associated repeat expansions in other TFs (HOXA13, RUNX2, 
      and TBP) were similarly found to alter their phase separation. These results 
      suggest that unblending of transcriptional condensates may underlie human 
      pathologies. We present a molecular classification of TF IDRs, which provides a 
      framework to dissect TF function in diseases associated with transcriptional 
      dysregulation.

TI  - Analysis of de novo HOXA13 polyalanine expansions supports replication slippage 
      without repair in their generation.
PG  - 1019-27
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.35843 [doi]
AB  - Polyalanine repeat expansion diseases are hypothesized to result from unequal 
      chromosomal recombination, yet mechanistic studies are lacking. We identified two 
      de novo cases of hand-foot-genital syndrome (HFGS) associated with polyalanine 
      expansions in HOXA13 that afforded rare opportunities to investigate the 
      mechanism. The first patient with HFGS was heterozygous for a de novo nine codon 
      polyalanine expansion. Haplotype investigation showed that the expansion arose on 
      the maternally inherited chromosome but not through unequal crossing over between 
      homologs, leaving unequal sister chromatid exchange during mitosis or meiosis or 
      slipped mispairing as possible explanations. The asymptomatic father of the 
      second patient with HFGS was mosaic for a six codon polyalanine expansion. 
      Multiple tissue PCR and clonal analysis of paternal fibroblasts showed only 
      expansion/WT and WT/WT clones, and haplotype data showed that two unaffected 
      offspring inherited the same paternal allele without the expansion, supporting a 
      postzygotic origin. Absence of the contracted allele in the mosaic father does 
      not support sister chromatid exchange in the origin of the expansion. Mosaicism 
      for HOXA13 polyalanine expansions may be associated with a normal phenotype, 
      making examination of parental DNA essential in apparently de novo HFGS cases to 
      predict accurate recurrence risks. We could not find an example in the literature 
      where unequal sister chromatid exchange has been proven for any polyalanine 
      expansion, suggesting that the principal mechanism for polyalanine expansions 
      (and contractions) is slipped mispairing without repair or that the true 
      frequency of unequal sister chromatid exchange involving these repeats is low.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a novel mutation found in a family with hand-foot-genital 
      syndrome (HFGS). To characterize the genetic basis of true HFGS versus presence 
      of non-HFGS-related uterovaginal septa. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: 
      Academic medical center. PATIENT(S): The HFGS patients and family members; women 
      with uterine or uterovaginal septa without other sequelae of HFGS. 
      INTERVENTION(S): Sequence analysis of HOXA13 in members of a family with HFGS (3 
      affected, 1 unaffected); sequence analysis of HOXA13 in biopsy samples obtained 
      from 17 non-HFGS patients with idiopathic uterine or uterovaginal septa and in 11 
      normal controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Presence or absence of mutations of 
      HOXA13. RESULT(S): Affected members of a family with HFGS showed a novel 
      expansion of the third polyalanine tract of HOXA13, inserting 10 alanines 
      in-frame. None of the patients with idiopathic uterovaginal septa displayed 
      mutations of HOXA13. CONCLUSION(S): The cause of uterovaginal septa without hand 
      and foot symptoms differs from true HFGS. When patients present with septa, it is 
      not necessary to subject them to roentgenograms of the distal limbs or to 
      sequence analysis of HOXA13 unless they show clear signs of the other sequelae 
      characteristic of true HFGS.

TI  - Molecular characterization of HOXA13 polyalanine expansion proteins in 
      hand-foot-genital syndrome.
PG  - 3161-8
AB  - We report on a father and daughter with hand-foot-genital syndrome (HFGS) with 
      typical skeletal and genitourinary anomalies due to a 14-residue polyalanine 
      expansion in HOXA13. This is the largest (32 residues) polyalanine tract so far 
      described for any polyalanine mutant protein. Polyalanine expansion results in 
      protein misfolding, cytoplasmic aggregation and degradation; however, HOXA13 
      polyalanine expansions appear to act as loss of function mutations in contrast to 
      gain of function for HOXD13 polyalanine expansions. To address this paradox we 
      examined the cellular consequences of polyalanine expansions on HOXA13 protein 
      using COS cell transfection and immunocytochemistry. HOXA13 polyalanine expansion 
      proteins form cytoplasmic aggregates, and distribution between cytoplasmic 
      aggregates or the nucleus is polyalanine tract size-dependent. Geldanamycin, an 
      Hsp90 inhibitor, reduces the steady-state abundance of all polyalanine-expanded 
      proteins in transfected cells. We also found that wild-type HOXA13 or HOXD13 
      proteins are sequestered in HOXA13 polyalanine expansion cytoplasmic aggregates. 
      Thus, the difference between HOXA13 polyalanine expansion loss-of-function and 
      HOXD13 polyalanine expansion dominant-negative effect is not the ability to 
      aggregate wild-type group 13 paralogs but perhaps to variation in activities 
      associated with refolding, aggregation or degradation of the proteins.

TI  - Polyalanine expansion in HOXA13: three new affected families and the molecular 
      consequences in a mouse model.
PG  - 2841-51
AB  - Polyalanine expansions in two of three large imperfect trinucleotide repeats 
      encoded by the first exon of HOXA13 have been reported in hand-foot-genital 
      syndrome (HFGS). Here we report additional families with expansions in the third 
      repeat of 11 and 12 alanine residues, the latter being the largest expansion 
      reported. We also report a patient with a novel, de novo 8-alanine expansion in 
      the first large repeat. Thus, expansions in all three large HOXA13 polyalanine 
      repeats can cause HFGS. To determine the molecular basis for impaired HOXA13 
      function, we performed homologous recombination in ES cells in mice to expand the 
      size of the third largest polyalanine tract by 10 residues (HOXA13(ALA28)). 
      Mutant mice were indistinguishable from Hoxa13 null mice. Mutant limb buds had 
      normal steady-state Hoxa13 RNA expression, normal mRNA splicing and reduced 
      levels of steady-state protein. In vitro translation efficiency of the 
      HOXA13(ALA28) protein was normal. Thus, loss of function is secondary to a 
      reduction in the in vivo abundance of the expanded protein likely due to 
      degradation.

TI  - The mouse Hoxd13(spdh) mutation, a polyalanine expansion similar to human type II 
      synpolydactyly (SPD), disrupts the function but not the expression of other Hoxd 
      genes.
PG  - 345-53
AB  - Polyalanine expansion in the human HOXD13 gene induces synpolydactyly (SPD), an 
      inherited congenital limb malformation. A mouse model was isolated, which showed 
      a spontaneous alanine expansion due to a 21-bp duplication at the corresponding 
      place in the mouse gene. This mutation (synpolydactyly homolog, spdh), when 
      homozygous, causes malformations in mice similar to those seen in affected human 
      patients. We have studied the genetics of this condition, by using several 
      engineered Hoxd alleles, as well as by looking at the expression of Hox and other 
      marker genes. We show that the mutated SPDH protein induces a gain-of-function 
      phenotype, likely by behaving as a dominant negative over other Hox genes. The 
      mutation, however, seems to act independently from Hoxa13 and doesn't appear to 
      affect Hox gene expression, except for a slight reduction of the HOXD13 protein 
      itself. Developmental studies indicate that the morphological effect is mostly 
      due to a severe retardation in the growth and ossification of the bony elements, 
      in agreement with a general impairment in the function of posterior Hoxd genes.
