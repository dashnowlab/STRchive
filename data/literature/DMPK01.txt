AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat-induced epigenetic changes are observed in many repeat 
      expansion disorders (REDs). These changes result in transcriptional deficits 
      and/or silencing of the associated gene. MSH2, a mismatch repair protein that is 
      required for repeat expansion in the REDs, has been implicated in the maintenance 
      of DNA methylation seen in the region upstream of the expanded CTG repeats at the 
      DMPK locus in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Here, we investigated the role of 
      MSH2 in aberrant DNA methylation in two additional REDs, fragile X syndrome (FXS) 
      that is caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 
      the Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene, and Friedreich's ataxia 
      (FRDA) that is caused by a GAA repeat expansion in intron 1 of the frataxin (FXN) 
      gene. RESULTS: In contrast to what is seen at the DMPK locus in DM1, loss of MSH2 
      did not decrease DNA methylation at the FMR1 promoter in FXS embryonic stem cells 
      (ESCs) or increase FMR1 transcription. This difference was not due to the 
      differences in the CpG density of the two loci as a decrease in DNA methylation 
      was also not observed in a less CpG dense region upstream of the expanded GAA 
      repeats in the FXN gene in MSH2 null induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) 
      derived from FRDA patient fibroblasts. Surprisingly, given previous reports, we 
      found that FMR1 reactivation was associated with a high frequency of 
      MSH2-independent CGG-repeat contractions that resulted a permanent loss of DNA 
      methylation. MSH2-independent GAA-repeat contractions were also seen in FRDA 
      cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that there are mechanistic differences in 
      the way that DNA methylation is maintained in the region upstream of expanded 
      repeats among different REDs even though they share a similar mechanism of repeat 
      expansion. The high frequency of transcription-induced MSH2-dependent and 
      MSH2-independent contractions we have observed may contribute to the mosaicism 
      that is frequently seen in carriers of FMR1 alleles with expanded CGG-repeat 
      tracts. These contractions may reflect the underlying problems associated with 
      transcription through the repeat. Given the recent interest in the therapeutic 
      use of transcription-driven repeat contractions, our data may have interesting 
      mechanistic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications.

TI  - Autism-related traits in myotonic dystrophy type 1 model mice are due to MBNL 
      sequestration and RNA mis-splicing of autism-risk genes.

AB  - Genome-wide enrichment of gene-specific tandem repeat expansions has been linked 
      to autism spectrum disorder. One such mutation is the CTG tandem repeat expansion 
      in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene, which is known to cause myotonic 
      muscular dystrophy type 1. Although there is a clear clinical association between 
      autism and myotonic dystrophy, the molecular basis for this connection remains 
      unknown. Here, we report that sequestration of MBNL splicing factors by mutant 
      DMPK RNAs with expanded CUG repeats alters the RNA splicing patterns of 
      autism-risk genes during brain development, particularly a class of 
      autism-relevant microexons. We demonstrate that both DMPK-CTG expansion and Mbnl 
      null mouse models recapitulate autism-relevant mis-splicing profiles, along with 
      social behavioral deficits and altered responses to novelty. These findings 
      support our model that myotonic dystrophy-associated autism arises from 
      developmental mis-splicing of autism-risk genes.

AB  - Short tandem repeats (STRs) are common variations in human genomes that 
      frequently expand or contract, causing genetic disorders, mainly when expanded. 
      Traditional diagnostic methods for identifying these expansions, such as 
      repeat-primed PCR and Southern blotting, are often labor-intensive, 
      locus-specific, and are unable to precisely determine long repeat expansions. 
      Sequencing-based methods, although capable of genome-wide detection, are limited 
      by inaccuracy (short-read technologies) and high associated costs (long-read 
      technologies). This study evaluated optical genome mapping (OGM) as an efficient, 
      accurate approach for measuring STR lengths and assessing somatic stability in 85 
      samples with known pathogenic repeat expansions in DMPK, CNBP, and RFC1, causing 
      myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 and cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), respectively. Three workflows-manual de 
      novo assembly, local guided assembly (local-GA), and a molecule distance 
      script-were applied, of which the latter two were developed as part of this study 
      to assess the repeat sizes and somatic repeat stability. OGM successfully 
      identified 84/85 (98.8%) of the pathogenic expansions, distinguishing between 
      wild-type and expanded alleles or between two expanded alleles in recessive 
      cases, with greater accuracy than standard of care (SOC) for long repeats and no 
      apparent upper size limit. Notably, OGM detected somatic instability in a subset 
      of DMPK, CNBP, and RFC1 samples. These findings suggest OGM could advance 
      diagnostic accuracy for large repeat expansions, providing a more comprehensive 
      genome-wide assay for repeat expansion disorders by measuring exact repeat 
      lengths and somatic instability across multiple loci simultaneously.

PG  - 733-743
LID - 10.1016/j.csbj.2025.02.016 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3' 
      untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This expansion leads to the production of 
      toxic RNA transcripts, which accumulate in the nucleus and interfere with normal 
      RNA processing. DM1 affects a broad range of tissues and systems such as the 
      skeletal muscle, the central nervous system, cardiac, visual, reproductive, and 
      gastrointestinal (GI) system. GI dysfunction is a significant but poorly 
      understood aspect of DM1. Particularly, it is unknown if there are alterations in 
      the intestinal microbiome in DM1. Here, we used a transgenic humanized mouse 
      model (DMSXL) to explore how the gut microbiome may be linked to GI issues in 
      DM1. For this purpose, 68 stool samples from Homozygous, Heterozygous, and 
      Wild-Type (WT) mice were collected. These samples were sequenced by MiSeq and 
      analyzed with DADA2 to generate taxonomic profiles. Our analysis indicated that 
      the overexpression of CTG repeats significantly influences the bacterial 
      structure of the gut microbiome in Homozygous mice samples, especially in terms 
      of the relative abundance of the Patescibacteria and Defferibacterota Phyla. 
      These results provide valuable information about the gut microbiota structure 
      thus improving the understanding of the role of these changes in the 
      pathogenicity as well as GI problems of DM1 patients.

TI  - Analysis of Short Tandem Repeat Expansions in a Cohort of 12,496 Exomes from 
      Patients with Neurological Diseases Reveals Variable Genotyping Rate Dependent on 
      Exome Capture Kits.
LID - 10.3390/genes16020169 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Short tandem repeat expansions are the most common cause 
      of inherited neurological diseases. These disorders are clinically and 
      genetically heterogeneous, such as in myotonic dystrophy and spinocerebellar 
      ataxia, and they are caused by different repeat motifs in different genomic 
      locations. Major advances in bioinformatic tools used to detect repeat expansions 
      from short read sequencing data in the last few years have led to the 
      implementation of these workflows into next generation sequencing pipelines in 
      healthcare. Here, we aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of analysing repeat 
      expansions through exome sequencing in a large cohort of genetically undiagnosed 
      patients with neurological disorders. METHODS: We here analyse 27 disease-causing 
      DNA repeats found in the coding, intronic and untranslated regions in 12,496 
      exomes in patients with a range of neurogenetic conditions. RESULTS: We 
      identified-and validated by polymerase chain reaction-29 repeat expansions across 
      a range of loci, 48% (n = 14) of which were diagnostic. We then analysed the 
      genotyping performance across all repeat loci and found that, despite high 
      coverage in most repeats in coding regions, some loci had low genotyping rates, 
      such as those that cause spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (ATXN2, 0.1-8.4%) and 
      Huntington disease (HTT, 0.2-58.2%), depending on the capture kit. Conversely, 
      while most intronic repeats were not genotyped, we found a high genotyping rate 
      in the intronic locus that causes spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (NOP56, 30.1-98.3%) 
      and in the one that causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DMPK, myotonic dystrophy 
      type 1). CONCLUSIONS: We show that the key factors that influence the genotyping 
      rate of repeat expansion loci analysis are the sequencing read length and exome 
      capture kit. These results provide important information about the performance of 
      exome sequencing as a genetic test for repeat expansion disorders.

TI  - MBNL overexpression rescues cardiac phenotypes in a myotonic dystrophy type 1 
      heart mouse model.
LID - 10.1172/JCI186416 [doi]
LID - e186416
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a CTG 
      repeat expansion in the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene. The 
      expanded CUG repeat RNA (CUGexp RNA) transcribed from the mutant allele 
      sequesters the muscleblind-like (MBNL) family of RNA-binding proteins, causing 
      their loss of function and disrupting regulated pre-mRNA processing. We used a 
      DM1 heart mouse model that inducibly expresses CUGexp RNA to test the 
      contribution of MBNL loss to DM1 cardiac abnormalities and explored MBNL 
      restoration as a potential therapy. AAV9-mediated overexpression of MBNL1 and/or 
      MBNL2 significantly rescued DM1 cardiac phenotypes including conduction delays, 
      contractile dysfunction, hypertrophy, and misregulated alternative splicing and 
      gene expression. While robust, the rescue was partial compared with reduced 
      CUGexp RNA and plateaued with increased exogenous MBNL expression. These findings 
      demonstrate that MBNL loss is a major contributor to DM1 cardiac manifestations 
      and suggest that additional mechanisms play a role, highlighting the complex 
      nature of DM1 pathogenesis.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a serious multisystem disorder caused by GCA 
      repeat expansions in the DMPK gene. Early and accurate diagnosis, often requiring 
      reliable DNA-diagnostic techniques, is critical for preventing life-threatening 
      cardiac complications. Clinically, two main diagnostic challenges exist. Firstly, 
      because of overlapping symptomatology with other conditions, conventional 
      DNA-testing methods focusing on DM1 expansion detection ensure diagnostic results 
      only in a small subset of patients, and frequently, further DNA-testing in 
      remaining cases is necessary. Secondly, because of variable symptomatology and 
      age of onset, not all DM1 patients are referred for DM1 genetic testing, leading 
      to unrecognized but at-risk cases. When using conventional methods, the main 
      technical problems are expanded-allele sizing and sensitivity to the presence of 
      sequence interruptions. On a set of 50 individual genomes, including ten DM1 
      patients, we tested the performance of short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS), 
      one of the most up-to-date molecular testing methods. We identified all 
      expansion-range DM1 alleles and characterized sequence interruptions in seven 
      expansion-range/premutation-range alleles. Although neither the tested 
      conventional methods, nor WGS allowed expanded-allele sizing, conventional 
      methods provided higher sizing limits for normal-range alleles. Genotyping 
      concordance rate was found to be 95-99 %. WGS was found to be superior in 
      elucidating the sequence structure of the motifs, even if they fall outside the 
      sizing limit (from partial reads). In addition, WGS enables the identification of 
      genetic modifiers in other genes and the detection of alternative diagnoses in 
      DM1-negative patients by extension of the bioinformatic evaluation of the 
      generated data.

TI  - Identification of ZNF850 as a novel CTG repeat expansion-related gene in myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1 patient-derived iPSCs.
PG  - 327-337
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddae186 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a dominantly inherited multi-system disease 
      caused by expanded CTG repeats in the 3' untranslated region of the dystrophia 
      myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene. Similar to other repeat disorders, the 
      expanded trinucleotide repeat is unstable and demonstrates a tendency to increase 
      repeat size with age in affected tissues. DNA mismatch repair system is 
      implicated in somatic instability. It has been demonstrated that DM1 
      patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (DM1-iPSCs) show repeat 
      instability, in which involvement of mismatch repair proteins has been suggested. 
      Here we identified ZNF850 as a novel CTG repeat expansion-related molecule in 
      DM1-iPSCs. ZNF850 was downregulated in a DM1-iPSC clone whose CTG repeat is 
      exceptionally stable. We found that RNAi-mediated ZNF850 downregulation in 
      DM1-iPSCs significantly reduced the repeat expansion and resulting instability. 
      In adult skeletal muscle tissue of DM1 patients, ZNF850 expression levels were 
      positively correlated with the repeat size. Furthermore, we found that ZNF850 
      protein can bind to the expanded CTG repeat sequence, and is located in proximity 
      to MutSbeta components. These results suggest that ZNF850 might play a role in 
      repeat instability in DM1 by recruiting MutSbeta to the repeat sequence.

TI  - dmTGS: Precise Targeted Enrichment Long-Read Sequencing Panel for Tandem Repeat 
      Detection.
PG  - 319-331
LID - 10.1093/clinchem/hvae164 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tandem repeats (TRs) are abundant in the human genome and associated 
      with repeat expansion disorders. Our study aimed to develop a tandem repeat panel 
      utilizing targeted long-read sequencing to evaluate known TRs associated with 
      these disorders and assess its clinical utility. METHODS: We developed a targeted 
      long-read sequencing panel for 70 TR loci, termed dynamic mutation 
      third-generation sequencing (dmTGS), using the PacBio Sequel II platform. We 
      tested 108 samples with suspected repeat expansion disorders and compared the 
      results with conventional molecular methods. RESULTS: For 108 samples, dmTGS 
      achieved an average of 8000 high-fidelity reads per sample, with a mean read 
      length of 4.7 kb and read quality of 99.9%. dmTGS outperformed repeat-primed-PCR 
      and fluorescence amplicon length analysis-PCR in distinguishing expanded from 
      normal alleles and accurately quantifying repeat counts. The method demonstrated 
      high concordance with confirmatory methods (rlinear = 0.991, P < 0.01), and 
      detected mosaicism with sensitivities of 1% for FMR1 CGG premutation and 5% for 
      full mutations. dmTGS successfully identified interruptive motifs in genes that 
      conventional methods had missed. For variable number TRs in the PLIN4 gene, dmTGS 
      identified precise repeat counts and sequence motifs. Screening 57 patients with 
      suspected genetic muscular diseases, dmTGS confirmed repeat expansions in genes 
      such as GIPC1, NOTCH2NLC, NUTM2B-AS1/LOC642361, and DMPK. Additionally, dmTGS 
      detected CCG interruptions in CTG repeats in 8 myotonic dystrophy type 1 patients 
      with detailed characterization. CONCLUSIONS: dmTGS accurately detects repeat 
      sizes and interruption motifs associated with repeat expansion disorders and 
      demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional molecular methods.

AB  - Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1), a highly prevalent form of muscular dystrophy, 
      is caused by (CTG)(n) repeat expansion in the DMPK gene. Much of DM1 research has 
      focused on the effects within the muscle and neurological tissues; however, DM1 
      patients also suffer from various metabolic and liver dysfunctions such as 
      increased susceptibility to metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease 
      (MAFLD) and heightened sensitivity to certain drugs. Here, we generated a 
      liver-specific DM1 mouse model that reproduces molecular and pathological 
      features of the disease, including susceptibility to MAFLD and reduced capacity 
      to metabolize specific analgesics and muscle relaxants. Expression of 
      CUG-expanded (CUG)(exp) repeat RNA within hepatocytes sequestered 
      muscleblind-like proteins and triggered widespread gene expression and RNA 
      processing defects. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that increased expression and 
      alternative splicing of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 drives excessive lipid 
      accumulation in DM1 livers, which is exacerbated by high-fat, high-sugar diets. 
      Together, these findings reveal that (CUG)(exp) RNA toxicity disrupts normal 
      hepatic functions, predisposing DM1 livers to injury, MAFLD, and drug clearance 
      pathologies that may jeopardize the health of affected individuals and complicate 
      their treatment.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystemic disorder caused by a CTG 
      triplet repeat expansion within the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. 
      Expression of the expanded allele generates RNA containing long tracts of CUG 
      repeats (CUGexp RNA) that form hairpin structures and accumulate in nuclear RNA 
      foci; however, the factors that control DMPK expression and the formation of 
      CUGexp RNA foci remain largely unknown. We performed an unbiased small molecule 
      screen in an immortalized human DM1 skeletal muscle myoblast cell line and 
      identified HSP90 as a modifier of endogenous RNA foci. Small molecule inhibition 
      of HSP90 leads to enhancement of RNA foci and upregulation of DMPK mRNA levels. 
      Knockdown and overexpression of HSP90 in undifferentiated DM1 myoblasts validated 
      the impact of HSP90 with upregulation and downregulation of DMPK mRNA, 
      respectively. Furthermore, we identified p-STAT3 as a downstream mediator of 
      HSP90 impacting levels of DMPK mRNA and RNA foci. Interestingly, differentiated 
      cells exhibited an opposite effect of HSP90 inhibition displaying downregulation 
      of DMPK mRNA through a mechanism independent of p-STAT3 involvement. This study 
      has revealed a novel mediator for DMPK mRNA and foci regulation in DM1 cells with 
      the potential to identify targets for future therapeutic intervention.

AB  - AIMS: Myotonic dystrophy Type 1 (DM1) is caused by the expansion of CTG repeats 
      (CTGn) in the DM1 protein kinase (DMPK) gene, while it remains unclear whether 
      CTGn may be associated with the incidence of cardiac events or sudden death in 
      Japan as well as Europe. The aim of this study was to investigate the association 
      between CTGn and cardiac involvements. METHODS AND RESULTS: This cohort study 
      included patients with DM1 who were retrospectively recruited from nine Japanese 
      hospitals specializing in neuromuscular diseases. A total of 496 patients with 
      DM1 who underwent a genetic test in the DMPK gene were analysed. Patients with 
      congenital form or under 15 years old were excluded and patients were assigned 
      into the quartiles. When we compared the incidence of cardiac events including 
      advanced/complete atrioventricular block, pacemaker implantation, and ventricular 
      tachycardias or mortality among four groups, patients with 1300 or longer CTGn 
      experienced composite cardiac events [hazard ratio (HR): 3.19, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI): 1.02-9.99, P = 0.014] more frequently and had significantly higher 
      mortality rate (HR: 6.79, 95% CI: 2.05-22.49, P < 0.001) than those under 400 
      CTGn while the rate of sudden death was not significantly different. CONCLUSION: 
      Regarding the cardiac events and mortality in patients with DM1, patients with 
      1300 or longer CTGn are at especially high risk.

AB  - This study evaluated therapeutic antimiRs in primary myoblasts from patients with 
      myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). DM1 results from unstable CTG repeat expansions 
      in the DMPK gene, leading to variable clinical manifestations by depleting 
      muscleblind-like splicing regulator protein MBNL1. AntimiRs targeting natural 
      repressors miR-23b and miR-218 boost MBNL1 expression but must be optimized for a 
      better pharmacological profile in humans. In untreated cells, miR-23b and miR-218 
      were up-regulated, which correlated with CTG repeat size, supporting that active 
      MBNL1 protein repression synergizes with the sequestration by CUG expansions in 
      DMPK. AntimiR treatment improved RNA toxicity readouts and corrected regulated 
      exon inclusions and myoblast defects such as fusion index and myotube area across 
      CTG expansions. Unexpectedly, the treatment also reduced DMPK transcripts and 
      ribonuclear foci. A leading antimiR reversed 68% of dysregulated genes. This 
      study highlights the potential of antimiRs to treat various DM1 forms across a 
      range of repeat sizes and genetic backgrounds by mitigating MBNL1 sequestration 
      and enhancing protein synthesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cell-based strategies are being explored as a therapeutic option for 
      muscular dystrophies, using a variety of cell types from different origin and 
      with different characteristics. Primary pericytes are multifunctional cells found 
      in the capillary bed that exhibit stem cell-like and myogenic regenerative 
      properties. This unique combination allows them to be applied systemically, 
      presenting a promising opportunity for body-wide muscle regeneration. We 
      previously reported the successful isolation of ALP(+) pericytes from skeletal 
      muscle of patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). These pericytes 
      maintained normal growth parameters and myogenic characteristics in vitro despite 
      the presence of nuclear (CUG)(n) RNA foci, the cellular hallmark of DM1. Here, we 
      examined the behaviour of DM1 pericytes during myogenic differentiation. METHODS: 
      DMPK (CTG)(n) repeat lengths in patient pericytes were assessed using small pool 
      PCR, to be able to relate variation in myogenic properties and disease hallmarks 
      to repeat expansion. Pericytes from unaffected controls and DM1 patients were 
      cultured under differentiating conditions in vitro. In addition, the pericytes 
      were grown in co-cultures with myoblasts to examine their regenerative capacity 
      by forming hybrid myotubes. Finally, the effect of pericyte fusion on DM1 disease 
      hallmarks was investigated. RESULTS: Small pool PCR analysis revealed the 
      presence of somatic mosaicism in pericyte cell pools. Upon differentiation to 
      myotubes, DMPK expression was upregulated, leading to an increase in nuclear foci 
      sequestering MBNL1 protein. Remarkably, despite the manifestation of these 
      disease biomarkers, patient-derived pericytes demonstrated myogenic potential in 
      co-culture experiments comparable to unaffected pericytes and myoblasts. However, 
      only the unaffected pericytes improved the disease hallmarks in hybrid myotubes. 
      From 20% onwards, the fraction of unaffected nuclei in myotubes positively 
      correlated with a reduction of the number of RNA foci and an increase in the 
      amount of free MBNL1. CONCLUSIONS: Fusion of only a limited number of unaffected 
      myogenic precursors to DM1 myotubes already ameliorates cellular disease 
      hallmarks, offering promise for the development of cell transplantation 
      strategies to lower disease burden.

AB  - INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Hypogammaglobulinemia is a common yet under-recognized feature 
      of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). The aims of our study were to determine the 
      frequency of immunoglobulin G (IgG) deficiency in our cohort, to examine the 
      association between immunoglobulin levels and cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) 
      repeat length in the DMPK gene, and to assess whether IgG levels are associated 
      with an increased risk of infection in DM1 patients. METHODS: We conducted a 
      single-center, retrospective cross-sectional study of 65 adult patients with DM1 
      who presented to the Neuromuscular Clinic at Concord Repatriation General 
      Hospital, Sydney, Australia, between January 2002 and January 2022. We 
      systematically collected and analyzed clinical, laboratory, and genetic data for 
      all patients with available serum electrophoresis and/or IgG level results. 
      RESULTS: Forty-one percent of DM1 patients had IgG deficiency despite normal 
      lymphocyte counts, IgA, IgM, and albumin levels. There was an association between 
      CTG repeat expansion size and the degree of IgG deficiency (F = 6.3, p = .02). 
      There was no association between IgG deficiency and frequency of infection in 
      this group (p = .428). DISCUSSION: IgG deficiency is a frequent occurrence in DM1 
      patients and is associated with CTG repeat expansion size. Whether 
      hypogammaglobulinemia is associated with increased infection risk in DM1 is 
      unclear. A prospective multicenter cohort study is needed to evaluate this.

      Families from the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystem disorder with progressive 
      myopathy and myotonia. The clinical study was conducted in the Republic of North 
      Ossetia-Alania (RNOA), and in it 39 individuals from 17 unrelated families were 
      identified with DM1. Clinical presentations varied, including muscle weakness, 
      fatigue, intellectual disability, hypersomnia, ophthalmological abnormalities, 
      and alopecia. Using clinical and genotyping data, we confirmed the diagnosis and 
      enabled the study of CTG-repeat anticipation and DM1 prevalence in the Ossetian 
      and Ingush populations. CTG expansion correlated with age of onset, with clinical 
      severity, and with offspring showing more severe symptoms than parents. In many 
      families, the youngest child had a more severe DM1 phenotype than older siblings. 
      The prevalence was 14.17 per 100,000 in Ossetians and 18.74 per 100,000 in Ingush 
      people, aligning with global data. Segregation analysis showed a higher frequency 
      of maternal transmission. The study highlights the clinical and genetic 
      heterogeneity of DM1 and its dependence on repeat expansion and paternal and 
      maternal age.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of hereditary myopathy is often challenging owing to 
      overlapping clinical phenotypes and muscle histopathological findings. This 
      retrospective study aimed to identify the phenotypic and genotypic spectra of 
      hereditary myopathies at a tertiary hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: We 
      reviewed the medical records of patients with hereditary myopathy who were 
      evaluated between January 2018 and December 2022. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients 
      (78 families) were included, two-thirds were men with a mean age of 35 (SD 14.2) 
      years. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) was the most prevalent clinical 
      diagnosis (25 cases; 29%), of whom, a genetic diagnosis was achieved in 15 of 22 
      patients tested (68%). In genetically confirmed LGMD, the most prevalent 
      disorders were dysferlinopathy (27%) followed by fukutin-related protein (FKRP) - 
      related limb girdle muscular dystrophy (20%), sarcoglycanopathy (20%), lamin A/C 
      related myopathy (13%), and calpain-3 myopathy (13%). In 26 patients with 
      pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants, the genetic testing method was whole exome 
      sequencing (WES) (42%), Next generation sequencing (NGS) (31%), and targeted 
      single gene analysis (27%). The sensitivity of each genetic testing method was as 
      follows: 100% for targeted single-gene analysis, 100% for targeted analysis of 
      D4Z4 repeat array units, 88% for myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) repeat 
      expansion analysis, 42% for NGS-neuromuscular panel, and 46% for WES. CONCLUSION: 
      The prevalent types of hereditary myopathies were consistent with those reported 
      locally and internationally. This study highlights the diagnostic yield of 
      various molecular genetic tests for the diagnosis of hereditary myopathy in an 
      adult cohort and the need for improved access to advanced molecular testing in 
      cases suspected to have facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) or 
      mitochondrial myopathies.

TI  - Expression levels of core spliceosomal proteins modulate the MBNL-mediated 
      spliceopathy in DM1.
PG  - 1873-1886
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddae125 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a heterogeneous multisystemic disease caused 
      by a CTG repeat expansion in DMPK. Transcription of the expanded allele produces 
      toxic CUG repeat RNA that sequesters the MBNL family of alternative splicing (AS) 
      regulators into ribonuclear foci, leading to pathogenic mis-splicing. To identify 
      genetic modifiers of toxic CUG RNA levels and the spliceopathy, we performed a 
      genome-scale siRNA screen using an established HeLa DM1 repeat-selective 
      screening platform. We unexpectedly identified core spliceosomal proteins as a 
      new class of modifiers that rescue the spliceopathy in DM1. Modest knockdown of 
      one of our top hits, SNRPD2, in DM1 fibroblasts and myoblasts, significantly 
      reduces DMPK expression and partially rescues MBNL-regulated AS dysfunction. 
      While the focus on the DM1 spliceopathy has centered around the MBNL proteins, 
      our work reveals an unappreciated role for MBNL:spliceosomal protein 
      stoichiometry in modulating the spliceopathy, revealing new biological and 
      therapeutic avenues for DM1.

TI  - Rescue of Scn5a mis-splicing does not improve the structural and functional heart 
      defects of a DM1 heart mouse model.
PG  - 1789-1799
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddae117 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant multisystemic disorder 
      for which cardiac features, including conduction delays and arrhythmias, are the 
      second leading cause of disease mortality. DM1 is caused by expanded CTG repeats 
      in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. Transcription of the expanded 
      DMPK allele produces mRNAs containing long tracts of CUG repeats, which sequester 
      the Muscleblind-Like family of RNA binding proteins, leading to their 
      loss-of-function and the dysregulation of alternative splicing. A 
      well-characterized mis-regulated splicing event in the DM1 heart is the increased 
      inclusion of SCN5A exon 6A rather than the mutually exclusive exon 6B that 
      normally predominates in adult heart. As previous work showed that forced 
      inclusion of Scn5a exon 6A in mice recapitulates cardiac DM1 phenotypes, we 
      tested whether rescue of Scn5a mis-splicing would improve the cardiac phenotypes 
      in a DM1 heart mouse model. We generated mice lacking Scn5a exon 6A to force the 
      expression of the adult SCN5A isoform including exon 6B and crossed these mice to 
      our previously established CUG960 DM1 heart mouse model. We showed that 
      correction Scn5a mis-splicing does not improve the DM1 heart conduction delays 
      and structural changes induced by CUG repeat RNA expression. Interestingly, we 
      found that in addition to Scn5a mis-splicing, Scn5a expression is reduced in 
      heart tissues of CUG960 mice and DM1-affected individuals. These data indicate 
      that Scn5a mis-splicing is not the sole driver of DM1 heart deficits and suggest 
      a potential role for reduced Scn5a expression in DM1 cardiac disease.

PG  - e63650
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.63650 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is an autosomal dominant condition due to a CTG repeat 
      expansion in the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene. This multisystem 
      disorder affects multiple organ systems. Hypogonadism in males affected by 
      myotonic dystrophy is commonly reported; however, the effect on female 
      hypogonadism remains controversial. A 19-year-old female was referred to our 
      genetics clinic due to primary amenorrhea without any family history of similar 
      symptoms. Initial genetics evaluation identified a variant of uncertain 
      significance in IGSF10, c.2210T>C (p.Phe737Ser). Follow-up genetic evaluation via 
      whole genome sequencing identified at least 100 CTG repeats in the DMPK gene, 
      thus resulting in the diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy type 1. The patient remains 
      otherwise asymptomatic from myotonic dystrophy. This is the first report that 
      demonstrates primary amenorrhea as a possible presenting feature of myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1, thus providing evidence supporting female hypogonadism in 
      myotonic dystrophy type 1.

AB  - Congenital myotonic dystrophy (CDM) is a genetic disease caused by an abnormally 
      long CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene, which generally increases in size 
      following intergenerational transmission. CDM is the rarest and most severe form 
      of myotonic dystrophy type 1, yet an important number of patient-derived cells 
      are needed to study this heterogeneous disease. Therefore, we have reprogrammed 
      lymphoblastoid cells derived from a 3-year-old male with CDM into induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs; CBRCULi015-A) featuring 1800 CTG repeats and 
      characterized their pluripotent state. This cell line constitutes an important 
      resource to study CDM and potential treatments in vitro.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is the most prevalent adult-onset muscular 
      dystrophy affecting 1 in 8,000 individuals. It is characterized by multisystemic 
      symptoms, primarily myopathy. The root cause of DM1 is a heterozygous CTG triplet 
      expansion beyond the normal size threshold in the non-coding region of the DM1 
      protein kinase gene (DMPK). In our study, we generated and characterized three 
      distinct DM1 induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines with CTG repeat 
      expansions ranging from 900 to 2000 in the DMPK gene. These iPSC lines maintained 
      normal karyotypes, exhibited distinctive colony morphology, robustly expressed 
      pluripotency markers, differentiated into the three primary germ layers, and 
      lacked residual viral vectors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a devastating multisystemic 
      disorder caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene, which subsequently 
      triggers toxic RNA expression and dysregulated splicing. In a preclinical study, 
      we demonstrated that erythromycin reduces the toxicity of abnormal RNA and 
      ameliorates the aberrant splicing and motor phenotype in DM1 model mice. METHODS: 
      This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial was 
      conducted at three centres in Japan to translate preclinical findings into 
      practical applications in patients with DM1 by evaluating the safety and efficacy 
      of erythromycin. Between Nov 29, 2019, and Jan 20, 2022, a total of 30 adult 
      patients with DM1 were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:2:2 ratio to receive 
      either placebo or erythromycin at two daily doses (500 mg or 800 mg) for 24 
      weeks. The primary outcome included the safety and tolerability of erythromycin. 
      The secondary efficacy measures included splicing biomarkers, 6-min walk test 
      results, muscle strength, and serum creatinine kinase (CK) values. This trial is 
      registered with the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials, jRCT2051190069. FINDINGS: 
      Treatment-related gastrointestinal symptoms occurred more frequently in the 
      erythromycin group, but all adverse events were mild to moderate and resolved 
      spontaneously. No serious safety concerns were identified. The CK levels from 
      baseline to week 24 decreased in the overall erythromycin group compared with the 
      placebo group (mean change of -6.4 U/L [SD 149] vs +182.8 [SD 228]), although 
      this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.070). Statistically 
      significant improvements in the overall erythromycin treated groups compared to 
      placebo were seen for two of the eleven splicing biomarkers that were each 
      evaluated in half of the trial sample. These were MBNL1 (p = 0.048) and CACNA1S 
      (p = 0.042). INTERPRETATION: Erythromycin demonstrated favourable safety and 
      tolerability profiles in patients with DM1. A well-powered phase 3 trial is 
      needed to evaluate efficacy, building on the preliminary findings from this 
      study. FUNDING: Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development.

AB  - Introduction: Circulating fetal cells isolated from maternal blood can be used 
      for prenatal testing, representing a safe alternative to invasive testing. The 
      present study investigated the potential of cell-based noninvasive prenatal 
      testing (NIPT) for diagnosing monogenic disorders dependent on the mode of 
      inheritance. Methods: Maternal blood samples were collected from women opting for 
      prenatal diagnostics for specific monogenic disorders (N = 7). Fetal trophoblasts 
      were enriched and stained using magnetic activated cell sorting and isolated by 
      fluorescens activated single-cell sorting. Individual cells were subject to whole 
      genome amplification, and cells of fetal origin were identified by DNA-profiling 
      using short tandem repeat markers. The amplified fetal DNA was input for genetic 
      testing for autosomal dominant-, autosomal recessive-, X-linked and repeat 
      expansion disorders by direct variant analysis and haplotyping. The cell-based 
      NIPT results were compared with those of invasive testing. Results: In two cases 
      at risk of skeletal dysplasia, caused by variants in the FGFR3 gene (autosomal 
      dominant disorders), cell-based NIPT correctly stated an affected fetus, but 
      allelic dropout of the normal alleles were observed in both cases. Cell-based 
      NIPT gave an accurate result in two cases at risk of autosomal recessive 
      disorders, where the parents carried either different diastrophic dysplasia 
      causing variants in the SLC26A2 gene or the same cystic fibrosis disease-causing 
      variant in the CFTR gene. Cell-based NIPT accurately identified an affected male 
      fetus in a pregnancy at risk of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD gene, X-linked 
      recessive disorders). In two cases at risk of the myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DMPK 
      gene, repeat expansion disorder), cell-based NIPT correctly detected an affected 
      and an unaffected fetus, respectively. Discussion: Circulating fetal cells can be 
      used to detect both maternally- and paternally inherited monogenic disorders 
      irrespective of the type of variant, however, the risk of allelic dropout must be 
      considered. We conclude that the clinical interpretation of the cell-based NIPT 
      result thus varies depending on the disorders' mode of inheritance.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a rare neuromuscular disease caused by a CTG 
      repeat expansion in the DMPK gene that generates toxic RNA with a myriad of 
      downstream alterations in RNA metabolism. A key consequence is the sequestration 
      of alternative splicing regulatory proteins MBNL1/2 by expanded transcripts in 
      the affected tissues. MBNL1/2 depletion interferes with a developmental 
      alternative splicing switch that causes the expression of fetal isoforms in 
      adults. Boosting the endogenous expression of MBNL proteins by inhibiting the 
      natural translational repressors miR-23b and miR-218 has previously been shown to 
      be a promising therapeutic approach. We designed antimiRs against both miRNAs 
      with a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO) chemistry conjugated 
      to cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) to improve delivery to affected tissues. In 
      DM1 cells, CPP-PMOs significantly increased MBNL1 levels. In some candidates, 
      this was achieved using concentrations less than two orders of magnitude below 
      the median toxic concentration, with up to 5.38-fold better therapeutic window 
      than previous antagomiRs. In HSA(LR) mice, intravenous injections of CPP-PMOs 
      improve molecular, histopathological, and functional phenotypes, without signs of 
      toxicity. Our findings place CPP-PMOs as promising antimiR candidates to overcome 
      the treatment delivery challenge in DM1 therapy.

AB  - Tandem repeat expansions are enriched in autism spectrum disorder, including CTG 
      expansion in the DMPK gene that underlines myotonic muscular dystrophy type 1. 
      Although the clinical connection of autism to myotonic dystrophy is corroborated, 
      the molecular links remained unknown. Here, we show a mechanistic path of autism 
      via repeat expansion in myotonic dystrophy. We found that inhibition of 
      muscleblind-like (MBNL) splicing factors by expanded CUG RNAs alerts the splicing 
      of autism-risk genes during brain development especially a class of 
      autism-relevant microexons. To provide in vivo evidence that the CTG expansion 
      and MBNL inhibition axis leads to the presentation of autistic traits, we 
      demonstrate that CTG expansion and MBNL-null mouse models recapitulate 
      autism-relevant mis-splicing profiles and demonstrate social deficits. Our 
      findings indicate that DMPK CTG expansion-associated autism arises from 
      developmental mis-splicing. Understanding this pathomechanistic connection 
      provides an opportunity for greater in-depth investigations of mechanistic 
      threads in autism.

TI  - Resistance Exercise Training Rescues Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Skeletal Muscle 
      of Patients with Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1.
PG  - 1111-1126
LID - 10.3233/JND-230099 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a dominant autosomal neuromuscular 
      disorder caused by the inheritance of a CTG triplet repeat expansion in the 
      Dystrophia Myotonica Protein Kinase (DMPK) gene. At present, no cure currently 
      exists for DM1 disease. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the effects of 12-week 
      resistance exercise training on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in 
      skeletal muscle in a cohort of DM1 patients (n = 11, men) in comparison to 
      control muscle with normal oxidative phosphorylation. METHODS: Immunofluorescence 
      was used to assess protein levels of key respiratory chain subunits of complex I 
      (CI) and complex IV (CIV), and markers of mitochondrial mass and cell membrane in 
      individual myofibres sampled from muscle biopsies. Using control's skeletal 
      muscle fibers population, we classified each patient's fibers as having normal, 
      low or high levels of CI and CIV and compared the proportions of fibers before 
      and after exercise training. The significance of changes observed between pre- 
      and post-exercise within patients was estimated using a permutation test. 
      RESULTS: At baseline, DM1 patients present with significantly decreased 
      mitochondrial mass, and isolated or combined CI and CIV deficiency. After 
      resistance exercise training, in most patients a significant increase in 
      mitochondrial mass was observed, and all patients showed a significant increase 
      in CI and/or CIV protein levels. Moreover, improvements in mitochondrial mass 
      were correlated with the one-repetition maximum strength evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Remarkably, 12-week resistance exercise training is sufficient to partially 
      rescue mitochondrial dysfunction in DM1 patients, suggesting that the response to 
      exercise is in part be due to changes in mitochondria.

TI  - Transcriptome-Wide Studies of RNA-Targeted Small Molecules Provide a Simple and 
      Selective r(CUG)(exp) Degrader in Myotonic Dystrophy.
PG  - 1342-1353
LID - 10.1021/acscentsci.2c01223 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by a highly structured RNA repeat 
      expansion, r(CUG)(exp), harbored in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of 
      dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) mRNA and drives disease through a 
      gain-of-function mechanism. A panel of low-molecular-weight fragments capable of 
      reacting with RNA upon UV irradiation was studied for cross-linking to 
      r(CUG)(exp)in vitro, affording perimidin-2-amine diazirine (1) that bound to 
      r(CUG)(exp). The interactions between the small molecule and RNA were further 
      studied by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and molecular modeling. 
      Binding of 1 in DM1 myotubes was profiled transcriptome-wide, identifying 12 
      transcripts including DMPK that were bound by 1. Augmenting the functionality of 
      1 with cleaving capability created a chimeric degrader that specifically targets 
      r(CUG)(exp) for elimination. The degrader broadly improved DM1-associated defects 
      as assessed by RNA-seq, while having limited effects on healthy myotubes. This 
      study (i) provides a platform to investigate molecular recognition of ligands 
      directly in disease-affected cells; (ii) illustrates that RNA degraders can be 
      more specific than the binders from which they are derived; and (iii) suggests 
      that repeating transcripts can be selectively degraded due to the presence of 
      multiple ligand binding sites.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in 
      adults and affects mainly the skeletal muscle, heart, and brain. DM1 is caused by 
      a CTG repeat expansion in the 3'UTR region of the DMPK gene that sequesters 
      muscleblind-like proteins, blocking their splicing activity and forming nuclear 
      RNA foci. Consequently, many genes have their splicing reversed to a fetal 
      pattern. There is no treatment for DM1, but several approaches have been 
      explored, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) aiming to knock down DMPK 
      expression or bind to the CTGs expansion. ASOs were shown to reduce RNA foci and 
      restore the splicing pattern. However, ASOs have several limitations and although 
      being safe treated DM1 patients did not demonstrate improvement in a human 
      clinical trial. AAV-based gene therapies have the potential to overcome such 
      limitations, providing longer and more stable expression of antisense sequences. 
      In the present study, we designed different antisense sequences targeting exons 5 
      or 8 of DMPK and the CTG repeat tract aiming to knock down DMPK expression or 
      promote steric hindrance, respectively. The antisense sequences were inserted in 
      U7snRNAs, which were then vectorized in AAV8 particles. Patient-derived myoblasts 
      treated with AAV8. U7snRNAs showed a significant reduction in the number of RNA 
      foci and re-localization of muscle-blind protein. RNA-seq analysis revealed a 
      global splicing correction in different patient-cell lines, without alteration in 
      DMPK expression.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant multisystemic disease 
      caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of DMPK 
      gene. DM1 alleles containing non-CTG variant repeats (VRs) have been described, 
      with uncertain molecular and clinical consequences. The expanded trinucleotide 
      array is flanked by two CpG islands, and the presence of VRs could confer an 
      additional level of epigenetic variability. This study aims to investigate the 
      association between VR-containing DMPK alleles, parental inheritance and 
      methylation pattern of the DM1 locus. The DM1 mutation has been characterized in 
      20 patients using a combination of SR-PCR, TP-PCR, modified TP-PCR and LR-PCR. 
      Non-CTG motifs have been confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The methylation pattern 
      of the DM1 locus was determined by bisulfite pyrosequencing. We characterized 7 
      patients with VRs within the CTG tract at 5' end and 13 patients carrying non-CTG 
      sequences at 3' end of the DM1 expansion. DMPK alleles with VRs at 5' end or 3' 
      end were invariably unmethylated upstream of the CTG expansion. Interestingly, 
      DM1 patients with VRs at the 3' end showed higher methylation levels in the 
      downstream island of the CTG repeat tract, preferentially when the disease allele 
      was maternally inherited. Our results suggest a potential correlation between 
      VRs, parental origin of the mutation and methylation pattern of the DMPK expanded 
      alleles. A differential CpG methylation status could play a role in the 
      phenotypic variability of DM1 patients, representing a potentially useful 
      diagnostic tool.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a genetic neuromuscular disorder that affects 
      many organs, including the heart. DM1 is caused by a heterozygous CTG triplet 
      expansion exceeding the normal size threshold in the non-coding region of the DM1 
      protein kinase gene (DMPK). We generated and characterized a DM1 iPSC line 
      carrying a 700 CTG repeat expansion as well as a control iPSC line from a healthy 
      individual. The two iPSC lines expressed several pluripotency markers, had the 
      capacity to differentiate into the three primary germ layers, had no residual 
      viral vectors, had normal karyotypes, and had a typical colony morphology.

AB  - Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapies for myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) are 
      based on elimination of transcripts containing an expanded repeat or inhibition 
      of sequestration of RNA-binding proteins. This activity is achievable by both 
      degradation of expanded transcripts and steric hindrance, although it is unknown 
      which approach is superior. We compared blocking ASOs with RNase H-recruiting 
      gapmers of equivalent chemistries. Two DMPK target sequences were selected: the 
      triplet repeat and a unique sequence upstream thereof. We assessed ASO effects on 
      transcript levels, ribonucleoprotein foci and disease-associated missplicing, and 
      performed RNA sequencing to investigate on- and off-target effects. Both gapmers 
      and the repeat blocker led to significant DMPK knockdown and a reduction in 
      (CUG)(exp) foci. However, the repeat blocker was more effective in MBNL1 protein 
      displacement and had superior efficiency in splicing correction at the tested 
      dose of 100 nM. By comparison, on a transcriptome level, the blocking ASO had the 
      fewest off-target effects. In particular, the off-target profile of the repeat 
      gapmer asks for cautious consideration in further therapeutic development. 
      Altogether, our study demonstrates the importance of evaluating both on-target 
      and downstream effects of ASOs in a DM1 context, and provides guiding principles 
      for safe and effective targeting of toxic transcripts.

AB  - Pathogenic short tandem repeat (STR) expansions cause over 20 neurodegenerative 
      diseases. To determine the contribution of STRs in sporadic amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), we used ExpansionHunter, 
      REviewer, and polymerase chain reaction validation to assess 21 neurodegenerative 
      disease-associated STRs in whole-genome sequencing data from 608 patients with 
      sporadic ALS, 68 patients with sporadic FTD, and 4703 matched controls. We also 
      propose a data-derived outlier detection method for defining allele thresholds in 
      rare STRs. Excluding C9orf72 repeat expansions, 17.6% of clinically diagnosed ALS 
      and FTD cases had at least one expanded STR allele reported to be pathogenic or 
      intermediate for another neurodegenerative disease. We identified and validated 
      162 disease-relevant STR expansions in C9orf72 (ALS/FTD), ATXN1 [spinal 
      cerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1)], ATXN2 (SCA2), ATXN8 (SCA8), TBP (SCA17), HTT 
      (Huntington's disease), DMPK [myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)], CNBP (DM2), and 
      FMR1 (fragile-X disorders). Our findings suggest clinical and pathological 
      pleiotropy of neurodegenerative disease genes and highlight their importance in 
      ALS and FTD.

TI  - Choroid plexus mis-splicing and altered cerebrospinal fluid composition in 
      myotonic dystrophy type 1.
PG  - 4217-4232
LID - 10.1093/brain/awad148 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is a dominantly inherited multisystemic disease caused 
      by CTG tandem repeat expansions in the DMPK 3' untranslated region. These 
      expanded repeats are transcribed and produce toxic CUG RNAs that sequester and 
      inhibit activities of the MBNL family of developmental RNA processing factors. 
      Although myotonic dystrophy is classified as a muscular dystrophy, the brain is 
      also severely affected by an unusual cohort of symptoms, including hypersomnia, 
      executive dysfunction, as well as early onsets of tau/MAPT pathology and cerebral 
      atrophy. To address the molecular and cellular events that lead to these 
      pathological outcomes, we recently generated a mouse Dmpk CTG expansion knock-in 
      model and identified choroid plexus epithelial cells as particularly affected by 
      the expression of toxic CUG expansion RNAs. To determine if toxic CUG RNAs 
      perturb choroid plexus functions, alternative splicing analysis was performed on 
      lateral and hindbrain choroid plexi from Dmpk CTG knock-in mice. Choroid plexus 
      transcriptome-wide changes were evaluated in Mbnl2 knockout mice, a 
      developmental-onset model of myotonic dystrophy brain dysfunction. To determine 
      if transcriptome changes also occurred in the human disease, we obtained 
      post-mortem choroid plexus for RNA-seq from neurologically unaffected (two 
      females, three males; ages 50-70 years) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (one 
      female, three males; ages 50-70 years) donors. To test that choroid plexus 
      transcriptome alterations resulted in altered CSF composition, we obtained CSF 
      via lumbar puncture from patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (five females, 
      five males; ages 35-55 years) and non-myotonic dystrophy patients (three females, 
      four males; ages 26-51 years), and western blot and osmolarity analyses were used 
      to test CSF alterations predicted by choroid plexus transcriptome analysis. We 
      determined that CUG RNA induced toxicity was more robust in the lateral choroid 
      plexus of Dmpk CTG knock-in mice due to comparatively higher Dmpk and lower Mbnl 
      RNA levels. Impaired transitions to adult splicing patterns during choroid plexus 
      development were identified in Mbnl2 knockout mice, including mis-splicing 
      previously found in Dmpk CTG knock-in mice. Whole transcriptome analysis of 
      myotonic dystrophy type 1 choroid plexus revealed disease-associated RNA 
      expression and mis-splicing events. Based on these RNA changes, predicted 
      alterations in ion homeostasis, secretory output and CSF composition were 
      confirmed by analysis of myotonic dystrophy type 1 CSF. Our results implicate 
      choroid plexus spliceopathy and concomitant alterations in CSF homeostasis as an 
      unappreciated contributor to myotonic dystrophy type 1 CNS pathogenesis.

TI  - Periostin as a blood biomarker of muscle cell fibrosis, cardiomyopathy and 
      disease severity in myotonic dystrophy type 1.
PG  - 3138-3158
LID - 10.1007/s00415-023-11633-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is the most common form 
      of adult-onset muscular dystrophy and is caused by an repeat expansion 
      [r(CUG)(exp)] located in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. Symptoms 
      include skeletal and cardiac muscle dysfunction and fibrosis. In DM1, there is a 
      lack of established biomarkers in routine clinical practice. Thus, we aimed to 
      identify a blood biomarker with relevance for DM1-pathophysiology and clinical 
      presentation. METHODS: We collected fibroblasts from 11, skeletal muscles from 
      27, and blood samples from 158 DM1 patients. Moreover, serum, cardiac, and 
      skeletal muscle samples from DMSXL mice were included. We employed proteomics, 
      immunostaining, qPCR and ELISA. Periostin level were correlated with CMRI-data 
      available for some patients. RESULTS: Our studies identified Periostin, a 
      modulator of fibrosis, as a novel biomarker candidate for DM1: proteomic 
      profiling of human fibroblasts and murine skeletal muscles showed significant 
      dysregulation of Periostin. Immunostaining on skeletal and cardiac muscles from 
      DM1 patients and DMSXL mice showed an extracellular increase of Periostin, 
      indicating fibrosis. qPCR studies indicated increased POSTN expression in 
      fibroblasts and muscle. Quantification of Periostin in blood samples from DMSXL 
      mice and two large validation cohorts of DM1 patients showed decreased levels in 
      animals and diseased individuals correlating with repeat expansion and disease 
      severity and presence of cardiac symptoms identified by MRI. Analyses of 
      longitudinal blood samples revealed no correlation with disease progression. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Periostin might serve as a novel stratification biomarker for DM1 
      correlating with disease severity, presence of cardiac malfunction and fibrosis.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy is a multisystemic neuromuscular disease caused by either a 
      CTG repeat expansion in DMPK (DM1) or a CCTG repeat expansion in CNBP (DM2). 
      Transcription of the expanded alleles produces toxic gain-of-function RNA that 
      sequester the MBNL family of alternative splicing regulators into ribonuclear 
      foci, leading to pathogenic mis-splicing. There are currently no approved 
      treatments that target the root cause of disease which is the production of the 
      toxic expansion RNA molecules. In this study, using our previously established 
      HeLa DM1 repeat selective screening platform, we identified the natural product 
      quercetin as a selective modulator of toxic RNA levels. Quercetin treatment 
      selectively reduced toxic RNA levels and rescued MBNL dependent mis-splicing in 
      DM1 and DM2 patient derived cell lines and in the HSA(LR) transgenic DM1 mouse 
      model where rescue of myotonia was also observed. Based on our data and its 
      safety profile for use in humans, we have identified quercetin as a priority 
      disease-targeting therapeutic lead for clinical evaluation for the treatment of 
      DM1 and DM2.

AB  - Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) have been found to play a role in a myriad of complex 
      traits and genetic diseases. We examined the variability in the lengths of over 
      850,000 STR loci in 996 children with suspected genetic disorders and 1,178 
      parents across six separate ancestral groups: Africans, Europeans, East Asians, 
      Admixed Americans, Non-admixed Americans, and Pacific Islanders. For each STR 
      locus we compared allele length between and within each ancestry group. In 
      relation to Europeans, admixed Americans had the most similar STR lengths with 
      only 623 positions either significantly expanded or contracted, while the 
      divergence was highest in Africans, with 4,933 chromosomal positions contracted 
      or expanded. We also examined probands to identify STR expansions at known 
      pathogenic loci. The genes TCF4, AR, and DMPK showed significant expansions with 
      lengths 250% greater than their various average allele lengths in 49, 162, and 11 
      individuals respectively. All 49 individuals containing an expansion in TCF4 and 
      six individuals containing an expansion in DMPK presented with allele lengths 
      longer than the known pathogenic length for these genes. Next, we identified 
      individuals with significant expansions in highly conserved loci across all 
      ancestries. Eighty loci in conserved regions met criteria for divergence. Two of 
      these individuals were found to have exonic STR expansions: one in ZBTB4 and the 
      other in SLC9A7, which is associated with X-linked mental retardation. Finally, 
      we used parent-child trios to detect and analyze de novo mutations. In total, we 
      observed 3,219 de novo expansions, where proband allele lengths are greater than 
      twice the longest parental allele length. This work helps lay the foundation for 
      understanding STR lengths genome-wide across ancestries and may help identify new 
      disease genes and novel mechanisms of pathogenicity in known disease genes.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a severe autosomal dominant neuromuscular 
      disease in which the musculoskeletal system contributes substantially to overall 
      mortality and morbidity. DM1 stems from a noncoding CTG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in the DMPK gene. The human skeletal actin long repeat (HSA(LR)) mouse 
      model reproduces several aspects of the disease, but the muscle-wasting phenotype 
      of this model has never been characterized in vivo. Herein, we used quantitative 
      MRI to measure the fat and muscle volumes in the leg compartment (LC) of mice. 
      These acquired data were processed to extract relevant parameters such as fat 
      fraction and fat infiltration (fat LC/LC) in HSA(LR) and control (FBV) muscles. 
      These results showed increased fat volume (fat LC) and fat infiltration within 
      the muscle tissue of the leg compartment (muscle LC), in agreement with 
      necropsies, in which fatty clumps were observed, and consistent with previous 
      findings in DM1 patients. Model mice did not reproduce the characteristic 
      impaired fat fraction, widespread fat replacement through the muscles, or reduced 
      muscle volume reported in patients. Taken together, the observed abnormal 
      replacement of skeletal muscle by fat in the HSA(LR) mice indicates that these 
      mice partially reproduced the muscle phenotype observed in humans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an incurable multisystem disease 
      caused by a CTG-repeat expansion in the DM1 protein kinase (DMPK) gene. The 
      OPTIMISTIC clinical trial demonstrated positive and heterogenous effects of 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on the capacity for activity and social 
      participations in DM1 patients. Through a process of reverse engineering, this 
      study aims to identify druggable molecular biomarkers associated with the 
      clinical improvement in the OPTIMISTIC cohort. METHODS: Based on full blood 
      samples collected during OPTIMISTIC, we performed paired mRNA sequencing for 27 
      patients before and after the CBT intervention. Linear mixed effect models were 
      used to identify biomarkers associated with the disease-causing CTG expansion and 
      the mean clinical improvement across all clinical outcome measures. RESULTS: We 
      identified 608 genes for which their expression was significantly associated with 
      the CTG-repeat expansion, as well as 1176 genes significantly associated with the 
      average clinical response towards the intervention. Remarkably, all 97 genes 
      associated with both returned to more normal levels in patients who benefited the 
      most from CBT. This main finding has been replicated based on an external dataset 
      of mRNA data of DM1 patients and controls, singling these genes out as candidate 
      biomarkers for therapy response. Among these candidate genes were DNAJB12, HDAC5, 
      and TRIM8, each belonging to a protein family that is being studied in the 
      context of neurological disorders or muscular dystrophies. Across the different 
      gene sets, gene pathway enrichment analysis revealed disease-relevant impaired 
      signaling in, among others, insulin-, metabolism-, and immune-related pathways. 
      Furthermore, evidence for shared dysregulations with another neuromuscular 
      disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, was found, suggesting a partial overlap in 
      blood-based gene dysregulation. CONCLUSIONS: DM1-relevant disease signatures can 
      be identified on a molecular level in peripheral blood, opening new avenues for 
      drug discovery and therapy efficacy assessments.

TI  - Delay of EGF-Stimulated EGFR Degradation in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1).
LID - 10.3390/cells11193018 [doi]
LID - 3018
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a CTG 
      repeat expansion in the 3' untranslated region of the dystrophia myotonica 
      protein kinase gene. AKT dephosphorylation and autophagy are associated with DM1. 
      Autophagy has been widely studied in DM1, although the endocytic pathway has not. 
      AKT has a critical role in endocytosis, and its phosphorylation is mediated by 
      the activation of tyrosine kinase receptors, such as epidermal growth factor 
      receptor (EGFR). EGF-activated EGFR triggers the internalization and degradation 
      of ligand-receptor complexes that serve as a PI3K/AKT signaling platform. Here, 
      we used primary fibroblasts from healthy subjects and DM1 patients. DM1-derived 
      fibroblasts showed increased autophagy flux, with enlarged endosomes and 
      lysosomes. Thereafter, cells were stimulated with a high concentration of EGF to 
      promote EGFR internalization and degradation. Interestingly, EGF binding to EGFR 
      was reduced in DM1 cells and EGFR internalization was also slowed during the 
      early steps of endocytosis. However, EGF-activated EGFR enhanced AKT and ERK1/2 
      phosphorylation levels in the DM1-derived fibroblasts. Therefore, there was a 
      delay in EGF-stimulated EGFR endocytosis in DM1 cells; this alteration might be 
      due to the decrease in the binding of EGF to EGFR, and not to a decrease in AKT 
      phosphorylation.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multi-systemic disorder caused by expansion 
      of CTG microsatellite repeats within DMPK. The most severe form, congenital 
      myotonic dystrophy (CDM), has symptom onset at birth due to large 
      intergenerational repeat expansions. Despite a common mutation, CDM individuals 
      present with a distinct clinical phenotype and absence of common DM1 symptoms. 
      Given the clinical divergence, it is unknown if the hallmark of DM1 pathology, 
      dysregulation of alternative splicing (AS) due to sequestration of MBNL proteins 
      within toxic CUG repeat RNAs, contributes to disease throughout pediatric 
      development. To evaluate global transcriptomic dysregulation, RNA-seq was 
      performed on 36 CDM skeletal muscle biopsies ages 2 weeks to 16 years, including 
      two longitudinal samples. Fifty DM1 and adult/pediatric controls were also 
      sequenced as comparative groups. Despite a large CTG expansion and shared age of 
      onset, CDM individuals presented with a heterogenous, MBNL-dependent mis-splicing 
      signature. Estimation of intracellular MBNL concentrations from splicing 
      responses of select events correlated with total spliceopathy and revealed a 
      distinct, triphasic pattern of AS dysregulation across pediatric development. CDM 
      infants (< 2 years) possess severe mis-splicing that significantly improves in 
      early childhood (2-8 years) independent of sex or CTG repeat load. Adolescent 
      individuals (8-16 years) stratified into two populations with a full range of 
      global splicing dysregulation. DMPK expression changes correlated with 
      alterations in splicing severity during development. This study reveals the 
      complex dynamics of the CDM muscle transcriptome and provides insights into new 
      therapeutic strategies, timing of therapeutic intervention, and biomarker 
      development.

TI  - Individual-specific levels of CTG*CAG somatic instability are shared across 
      multiple tissues in myotonic dystrophy type 1.
PG  - 621-631
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddac231 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is a complex disease caused by a genetically unstable 
      CTG repeat expansion in the 3'-untranslated region of the DMPK gene. 
      Age-dependent, tissue-specific somatic instability has confounded 
      genotype-phenotype associations, but growing evidence suggests that it also 
      contributes directly toward disease progression. Using a well-characterized 
      clinical cohort of DM1 patients from Costa Rica, we quantified somatic 
      instability in blood, buccal cells, skin and skeletal muscle. Whilst skeletal 
      muscle showed the largest expansions, modal allele lengths in skin were also very 
      large and frequently exceeded 2000 CTG repeats. Similarly, the degree of somatic 
      expansion in blood, muscle and skin were associated with each other. Notably, we 
      found that the degree of somatic expansion in skin was highly predictive of that 
      in skeletal muscle. More importantly, we established that individuals whose 
      repeat expanded more rapidly than expected in one tissue (after correction for 
      progenitor allele length and age) also expanded more rapidly than expected in 
      other tissues. We also provide evidence suggesting that individuals in whom the 
      repeat expanded more rapidly than expected in skeletal muscle have an earlier age 
      at onset than expected (after correction for the progenitor allele length). 
      Pyrosequencing analyses of the genomic DNA flanking the CTG repeat revealed that 
      the degree of methylation in muscle was well predicted by the muscle modal allele 
      length and age, but that neither methylation of the flanking DNA nor levels of 
      DMPK sense and anti-sense transcripts could obviously explain individual- or 
      tissue-specific patterns of somatic instability.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) exhibits highly heterogeneous clinical 
      manifestations caused by an unstable CTG repeat expansion reaching up to 4000 
      CTG. The clinical variability depends on CTG repeat number, CNG repeat 
      interruptions, and somatic mosaicism. Currently, none of these factors are 
      simultaneously and accurately determined due to the limitations of gold standard 
      methods used in clinical and research laboratories. An amplicon method for 
      targeting the DMPK locus using single-molecule real-time sequencing was recently 
      developed to accurately analyze expanded alleles. However, amplicon-based 
      sequencing still depends on PCR, and the inherent bias toward preferential 
      amplification of smaller repeats can be problematic in DM1. Thus, an 
      amplification-free long-read sequencing method was developed by using CRISPR/Cas9 
      technology in DM1. This method was used to sequence the DMPK locus in patients 
      with CTG repeat expansion ranging from 130 to >1000 CTG. We showed that 
      elimination of PCR amplification improves the accuracy of measurement of 
      inherited repeat number and somatic repeat variations, two key factors in DM1 
      severity and age at onset. For the first time, an expansion composed of >85% CCG 
      repeats was identified by using this innovative method in a DM1 family with an 
      atypical clinical profile. No-amplification targeted sequencing represents a 
      promising method that can overcome research and diagnosis shortcomings, with 
      translational implications for clinical and genetic counseling in DM1.

TI  - Intergenerational Influence of Gender and the DM1 Phenotype of the Transmitting

LID - 10.3390/genes13081465 [doi]
LID - 1465
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is the most common autosomal-dominant disorder 
      caused by the CTG repeat expansion of the DMPK, and it has been categorized into 
      three phenotypes: mild, classic, and congenital DM1. Here, we reviewed the 
      intergenerational influence of gender and phenotype of the transmitting parent on 
      the occurrence of Korean DM1. A total of 44 parent-child pairs matched for the 
      gender of the transmitting parent and the affected child and 29 parent-child 
      pairs matched for the gender and DM1 phenotype of the transmitting parent were 
      reviewed. The CTG repeat size of the DMPK in the affected child was found to be 
      significantly greater when transmitted by a female parent to a female child 
      (DM1-FF) (median, 1309 repeats; range, 400-2083) than when transmitted by a male 
      parent to a male child (650; 160-1030; p = 0.038 and 0.048 using the Tukey HSD 
      and the Bonferroni test) or by a male parent to a female child (480; 94-1140; p = 
      0.003). The difference in the CTG repeat size of the DMPK between the 
      transmitting parent and the affected child was also lower when transmitted from a 
      male parent with classic DM1 (-235; -280 to 0) compared to when it was 
      transmitted from a female parent with mild DM1 (866; 612-905; p = 0.015 and 
      0.019) or from a female parent with classic DM1 (DM1-FC) (605; 10-1393; p = 
      0.005). This study highlights that gender and the DM1 phenotype of the 
      transmitting parent had an impact on the CTG repeat size of the DMPK in the 
      affected child, with greater increases being inherited from the DM1-FF or DM1-FC 
      situations in Korean DM1.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is a multisystem genetic disorder involving the muscle, 
      heart and CNS. It is caused by toxic RNA transcription from expanded CTG repeats 
      in the 3'-untranslated region of DMPK, leading to dysregulated splicing of 
      various genes and multisystemic symptoms. Although aberrant splicing of several 
      genes has been identified as the cause of some muscular symptoms, the 
      pathogenesis of CNS symptoms prevalent in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 
      remains unelucidated, possibly due to a limitation in studying a diverse mixture 
      of different cell types, including neuronal cells and glial cells. Previous 
      studies revealed neuronal loss in the cortex, myelin loss in the white matter and 
      the presence of axonal neuropathy in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1. To 
      elucidate the CNS pathogenesis, we investigated cell type-specific abnormalities 
      in cortical neurons, white matter glial cells and spinal motor neurons via 
      laser-capture microdissection. We observed that the CTG repeat instability and 
      cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) methylation status varied among the CNS cell 
      lineages; cortical neurons had more unstable and longer repeats with higher CpG 
      methylation than white matter glial cells, and spinal motor neurons had more 
      stable repeats with lower methylation status. We also identified splicing 
      abnormalities in each CNS cell lineage, such as DLGAP1 in white matter glial 
      cells and CAMKK2 in spinal motor neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 
      aberrant splicing of CAMKK2 is associated with abnormal neurite morphology in 
      myotonic dystrophy type 1 motor neurons. Our laser-capture microdissection-based 
      study revealed cell type-dependent genetic, epigenetic and splicing abnormalities 
      in myotonic dystrophy type 1 CNS, indicating the significant potential of cell 
      type-specific analysis in elucidating the CNS pathogenesis.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystem, autosomal-dominant inherited 
      disorder caused by CTG microsatellite repeat expansions (MREs) in the 3' 
      untranslated region of the dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase (DMPK) gene. 
      Despite its prominence as the most common adult-onset muscular dystrophy, 
      patients with congenital to juvenile-onset forms of DM1 can present with 
      debilitating neurocognitive symptoms along the autism spectrum, characteristic of 
      possible in utero cortical defects. However, the molecular mechanism by which CTG 
      MREs lead to these developmental central nervous system (CNS) manifestations is 
      unknown. Here, we showed that CUG foci found early in the maturation of 
      three-dimensional (3D) cortical organoids from DM1 patient-derived induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) cause hyperphosphorylation of CUGBP Elav-like 
      family member 2 (CELF2) protein. Integrative single-cell RNA sequencing and 
      enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) analysis revealed that 
      reduced CELF2 protein-RNA substrate interactions results in misregulation of 
      genes critical for excitatory synaptic signaling in glutamatergic neurons, 
      including key components of the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) pathway. 
      Comparisons to MECP2((y/-)) cortical organoids revealed convergent molecular and 
      cellular defects such as glutamate toxicity and neuronal loss. Our findings 
      provide evidence suggesting that early-onset DM1 might involve neurodevelopmental 
      disorder-associated pathways and identify N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) 
      antagonists as potential treatment avenues for neuronal defects in DM1.

TI  - High Resolution Analysis of DMPK Hypermethylation and Repeat Interruptions in 
      Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1.
LID - 10.3390/genes13060970 [doi]
LID - 970
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystemic neuromuscular disorder caused 
      by the expansion of a CTG repeat in the 3'-UTR of DMPK, which is transcribed to a 
      toxic gain-of-function RNA that affects splicing of a range of genes. The 
      expanded repeat is unstable in both germline and somatic cells. The variable age 
      at disease onset and severity of symptoms have been linked to the inherited CTG 
      repeat length, non-CTG interruptions, and methylation levels flanking the repeat. 
      In general, the genetic biomarkers are investigated separately with specific 
      methods, making it tedious to obtain an overall characterisation of the repeat 
      for a given individual. In the present study, we employed Oxford nanopore 
      sequencing in a pilot study to simultaneously determine the repeat lengths, 
      investigate the presence and nature of repeat interruptions, and quantify 
      methylation levels in the regions flanking the CTG-repeats in four patients with 
      DM1. We determined the repeat lengths, and in three patients, we observed 
      interruptions which were not detected using repeat-primed PCR. Interruptions may 
      thus be more common than previously anticipated and should be investigated in 
      larger cohorts. Allele-specific analyses enabled characterisation of aberrant 
      methylation levels specific to the expanded allele, which greatly increased the 
      sensitivity and resolved cases where the methylation levels were ambiguous.

TI  - Mice lacking MBNL1 and MBNL2 exhibit sudden cardiac death and molecular 
      signatures recapitulating myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 3144-3160
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddac108 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by expansions of C(C)TG repeats in the 
      non-coding regions of the DMPK and CNBP genes, and DM patients often suffer from 
      sudden cardiac death due to lethal conduction block or arrhythmia. Specific 
      molecular changes that underlie DM cardiac pathology have been linked to 
      repeat-associated depletion of Muscleblind-like (MBNL) 1 and 2 proteins and 
      upregulation of CUGBP, Elav-like family member 1 (CELF1). Hypothesis solely 
      targeting MBNL1 or CELF1 pathways that could address all the consequences of 
      repeat expansion in heart remained inconclusive, particularly when the direct 
      cause of mortality and results of transcriptome analyses remained undetermined in 
      Mbnl compound knockout (KO) mice with cardiac phenotypes. Here, we develop 
      Myh6-Cre double KO (DKO) (Mbnl1-/-; Mbnl2cond/cond; Myh6-Cre+/-) mice to 
      eliminate Mbnl1/2 in cardiomyocytes and observe spontaneous lethal cardiac events 
      under no anesthesia. RNA sequencing recapitulates DM heart spliceopathy and shows 
      gene expression changes that were previously undescribed in DM heart studies. 
      Notably, immunoblotting reveals a nearly 6-fold increase of Calsequestrin 1 and 
      50% reduction of epidermal growth factor proteins. Our findings demonstrate that 
      complete ablation of MBNL1/2 in cardiomyocytes is essential for generating sudden 
      death due to lethal cardiac rhythms and reveal potential mechanisms for DM heart 
      pathogenesis.

AB  - The blood transcriptome was examined in relation to disease severity in type I 
      myotonic dystrophy (DM1) patients who participated in the Observational Prolonged 
      Trial In DM1 to Improve QoL- Standards (OPTIMISTIC) study. This sought to (a) 
      ascertain if transcriptome changes were associated with increasing disease 
      severity, as measured by the muscle impairment rating scale (MIRS), and (b) 
      establish if these changes in mRNA expression and associated biological pathways 
      were also observed in the Dystrophia Myotonica Biomarker Discovery Initiative 
      (DMBDI) microarray dataset in blood (with equivalent MIRS/DMPK repeat length). 
      The changes in gene expression were compared using a number of complementary 
      pathways, gene ontology and upstream regulator analyses, which suggested that 
      symptom severity in DM1 was linked to transcriptomic alterations in innate and 
      adaptive immunity associated with muscle-wasting. Future studies should explore 
      the role of immunity in DM1 in more detail to assess its relevance to DM1.

LID - 10.1016/j.jdin.2021.09.008 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 are a group of complex genetic disorders 
      resulting from the expansion of (CTG)(n) nucleotide repeats in the DMPK gene. In 
      addition to the hallmark manifestations of myotonia and skeletal muscle atrophy, 
      myotonic dystrophy also affects a myriad of other organs including the heart, 
      lungs, as well as the skin. The most common cutaneous manifestations of myotonic 
      dystrophy are early male frontal alopecia and adult-onset pilomatricomas. 
      Myotonic dystrophy also increases the risk of developing malignant skin diseases 
      such as basal cell carcinoma and melanoma. To aid in the diagnosis and treatment 
      of myotonic dystrophy related skin conditions, it is important for the 
      dermatologist to become cognizant of the common and rare cutaneous manifestations 
      of this genetic disorder. We performed a PubMed search using the key terms 
      "myotonic dystrophy" AND "cutaneous" OR "skin" OR "dermatologic" AND 
      "manifestation" OR "finding." The resulting publications were manually reviewed 
      for additional relevant publications, and subsequent additional searches were 
      performed as needed, especially regarding the molecular mechanisms of 
      pathogenesis. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of myotonic dystrophy 
      types 1 and 2 and summarize their cutaneous manifestations as well as potential 
      mechanisms of pathogenesis.

TI  - Whole genome sequencing for the diagnosis of neurological repeat expansion 
      disorders in the UK: a retrospective diagnostic accuracy and prospective clinical 
      validation study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansion disorders affect about 1 in 3000 individuals and are 
      clinically heterogeneous diseases caused by expansions of short tandem DNA 
      repeats. Genetic testing is often locus-specific, resulting in underdiagnosis of 
      people who have atypical clinical presentations, especially in paediatric 
      patients without a previous positive family history. Whole genome sequencing is 
      increasingly used as a first-line test for other rare genetic disorders, and we 
      aimed to assess its performance in the diagnosis of patients with neurological 
      repeat expansion disorders. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic 
      accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect the most common repeat expansion 
      loci associated with neurological outcomes (AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, 
      C9orf72, CACNA1A, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, and TBP) using samples obtained within 
      the National Health Service in England from patients who were suspected of having 
      neurological disorders; previous PCR test results were used as the reference 
      standard. The clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat 
      expansions was prospectively examined in previously genetically tested and 
      undiagnosed patients recruited in 2013-17 to the 100 000 Genomes Project in the 
      UK, who were suspected of having a genetic neurological disorder (familial or 
      early-onset forms of ataxia, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, dementia, motor 
      neuron disease, parkinsonian movement disorders, intellectual disability, or 
      neuromuscular disorders). If a repeat expansion call was made using whole genome 
      sequencing, PCR was used to confirm the result. FINDINGS: The diagnostic accuracy 
      of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat expansions was evaluated against 793 
      PCR tests previously performed within the NHS from 404 patients. Whole genome 
      sequencing correctly classified 215 of 221 expanded alleles and 1316 of 1321 
      non-expanded alleles, showing 97.3% sensitivity (95% CI 94.2-99.0) and 99.6% 
      specificity (99.1-99.9) across the 13 disease-associated loci when compared with 
      PCR test results. In samples from 11 631 patients in the 100 000 Genomes Project, 
      whole genome sequencing identified 81 repeat expansions, which were also tested 
      by PCR: 68 were confirmed as repeat expansions in the full pathogenic range, 11 
      were non-pathogenic intermediate expansions or premutations, and two were 
      non-expanded repeats (16% false discovery rate). INTERPRETATION: In our study, 
      whole genome sequencing for the detection of repeat expansions showed high 
      sensitivity and specificity, and it led to identification of neurological repeat 
      expansion disorders in previously undiagnosed patients. These findings support 
      implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical laboratories for diagnosis 
      of patients who have a neurological presentation consistent with a repeat 
      expansion disorder. FUNDING: Medical Research Council, Department of Health and

AB  - CRISPR/Cas9-mediated therapeutic gene editing is a promising technology for 
      durable treatment of incurable monogenic diseases such as myotonic dystrophies. 
      Gene-editing approaches have been recently applied to in vitro and in vivo models 
      of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) to delete the pathogenic CTG-repeat expansion 
      located in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. In DM1-patient-derived 
      cells removal of the expanded repeats induced beneficial effects on major 
      hallmarks of the disease with reduction in DMPK transcript-containing ribonuclear 
      foci and reversal of aberrant splicing patterns. Here, we set out to excise the 
      triplet expansion in a time-restricted and cell-specific fashion to minimize the 
      potential occurrence of unintended events in off-target genomic loci and select 
      for the target cell type. To this aim, we employed either a ubiquitous 
      promoter-driven or a muscle-specific promoter-driven Cas9 nuclease and 
      tetracycline repressor-based guide RNAs. A dual-vector approach was used to 
      deliver the CRISPR/Cas9 components into DM1 patient-derived cells and in skeletal 
      muscle of a DM1 mouse model. In this way, we obtained efficient and inducible 
      gene editing both in proliferating cells and differentiated post-mitotic myocytes 
      in vitro as well as in skeletal muscle tissue in vivo.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is mainly caused by abnormal number of the CTG repeat 
      sequence of the DMPK gene. DM1 clinically manifests mainly as progressive 
      muscular atrophy and muscle weakness. Cataracts form in the eyes of some 
      patients. We successfully induced skin fibroblasts from a DM1 patient with 
      cataract and in turn induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using an unintegrated 
      reprogramming approach. This cell line will provide a reliable cell model for 
      further studies on the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets of DM1.

TI  - Preclinical characterization of antagomiR-218 as a potential treatment for 
      myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 174-191
LID - 10.1016/j.omtn.2021.07.017 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a rare neuromuscular disease caused by 
      expansion of unstable CTG repeats in a non-coding region of the DMPK gene. CUG 
      expansions in mutant DMPK transcripts sequester MBNL1 proteins in ribonuclear 
      foci. Depletion of this protein is a primary contributor to disease symptoms such 
      as muscle weakness and atrophy and myotonia, yet upregulation of endogenous MBNL1 
      levels may compensate for this sequestration. Having previously demonstrated that 
      antisense oligonucleotides against miR-218 boost MBNL1 expression and rescue 
      phenotypes in disease models, here we provide preclinical characterization of an 
      antagomiR-218 molecule using the HSA(LR) mouse model and patient-derived 
      myotubes. In HSA(LR), antagomiR-218 reached 40-60 pM 2 weeks after injection, 
      rescued molecular and functional phenotypes in a dose- and time-dependent manner, 
      and showed a good toxicity profile after a single subcutaneous administration. In 
      muscle tissue, antagomiR rescued the normal subcellular distribution of Mbnl1 and 
      did not alter the proportion of myonuclei containing CUG foci. In patient-derived 
      cells, antagomiR-218 improved defective fusion and differentiation and rescued up 
      to 34% of the gene expression alterations found in the transcriptome of patient 
      cells. Importantly, miR-218 was found to be upregulated in DM1 muscle biopsies, 
      pinpointing this microRNA (miRNA) as a relevant therapeutic target.

TI  - Mediastinal and pleural lipomatosis as a manifestation of myotonic dystrophy type 
      1.
PG  - 486-488
LID - 10.4103/lungindia.lungindia_25_21 [doi]
AB  - Mediastinal and pleural lipomatosis is a rare but usually benign and asymptomatic 
      disease. Mediastinal lipomatosis is associated with steroid use, obesity, 
      hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or Cushing syndrome. In some cases, it becomes 
      symptomatic manifesting with dyspnea, thoracic pain, coughing, dysphonia, 
      dysphagia, supraventricular tachycardia, or persistent pneumonia. Mediastinal 
      lipomatosis has not been reported in association with myotonic dystrophy type 1 
      (MD1). In a 65yo male with a long-term history of progressive muscle weakness, 
      hyper-creatine-kinase-emia, bilateral cataract, sleep apnea syndrome, 
      gynecomastia, hepatic steatosis, arterial hypertension, atrioventricular block 1, 
      QTc prolongation, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, and hepatopathy, MD1 was 
      diagnosed upon the clinical presentation and a heterozygous CTG repeat expansion 
      of 1200-1400 repeats in DMPK. Work-up for dyspnea and leg edema revealed heart 
      failure and mediastinal and pleural lipomatosis. Upon standard treatment, heart 
      failure resolved. In conclusion, mediastinal and pleural lipomatosis can be a 
      rare manifestation of MD1 and can manifest with heart failure. In patients with 
      mediastinal lipomatosis, MD1 should be excluded.

TI  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) clinical subtypes and CTCF site methylation 
      status flanking the CTG expansion are mutant allele length-dependent.
PG  - 262-274
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddab243 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a complex disease with a wide spectrum of 
      symptoms. The exact relationship between mutant CTG repeat expansion size and 
      clinical outcome remains unclear. DM1 congenital patients (CDM) inherit the 
      largest expanded alleles, which are associated with abnormal and increased DNA 
      methylation flanking the CTG repeat. However, DNA methylation at the DMPK locus 
      remains understudied. Its relationship to DM1 clinical subtypes, expansion size 
      and age-at-onset is not yet completely understood. Using pyrosequencing-based 
      methylation analysis on 225 blood DNA samples from Costa Rican DM1 patients, we 
      determined that the size of the estimated progenitor allele length (ePAL) is not 
      only a good discriminator between CDM and non-CDM cases (with an estimated 
      threshold at 653 CTG repeats), but also for all DM1 clinical subtypes. Secondly, 
      increased methylation at both CTCF sites upstream and downstream of the expansion 
      was almost exclusively present in CDM cases. Thirdly, levels of abnormal 
      methylation were associated with clinical subtype, age and ePAL, with strong 
      correlations between these variables. Fourthly, both ePAL and the 
      intergenerational expansion size were significantly associated with methylation 
      status. Finally, methylation status was associated with ePAL and maternal 
      inheritance, with almost exclusively maternal transmission of CDM. In conclusion, 
      increased DNA methylation at the CTCF sites flanking the DM1 expansion could be 
      linked to ePAL, and both increased methylation and the ePAL could be considered 
      biomarkers for the CDM phenotype.

TI  - Co-occurrence of DMPK expansion and CLCN1 mutation in a patient with myotonia.
PG  - 5365-5368
LID - 10.1007/s10072-021-05538-y [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Myotonic disorders are a group of diseases affecting the muscle, in 
      different ways. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is related to (CTG)n expansion in 
      the 3-untranslated region of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene 
      and is the most frequent and disabling form, causing muscular, visibility, 
      respiratory, and cardiac impairment. Non-dystrophic myotonias (NDMs) affect the 
      skeletal muscle alone. In particular, mutations in the chloride channel (CLCN1) 
      gene cause myotonia congenita (MC), which can have autosomal dominant or 
      recessive inheritance. CASE REPORT: We describe a patient with a family history 
      of asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic myotonia, who presented handgrip myotonia 
      which sharply reduced after mexiletine administration. Molecular analysis showed 
      both a paternally inherited DMPK expansion and a maternally inherited CLCN1 
      mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Only one other similar case was reported so far; however, 
      the segregation of the two mutations and the characteristics of the muscle were 
      not studied. Since our patient lacked the classical phenotypical and muscle 
      histopathological characteristics of DM1 and showed mild splicing alterations 
      despite a pathogenic DMPK expansion and the nuclear accumulation of toxic RNA, we 
      may speculate that the co-occurrence of a CLCN1 mutation could have attenuated 
      the severity of DM1 phenotype.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening for short tandem repeat (STR) expansions in next-generation 
      sequencing data can enable diagnosis, optimal clinical management/treatment, and 
      accurate genetic counseling of patients with repeat expansion disorders. We aimed 
      to develop an efficient computational workflow for reliable detection of STR 
      expansions in next-generation sequencing data and demonstrate its clinical 
      utility. METHODS: We characterized the performance of eight STR analysis methods 
      (lobSTR, HipSTR, RepeatSeq, ExpansionHunter, TREDPARSE, GangSTR, STRetch, and 
      exSTRa) on next-generation sequencing datasets of samples with known 
      disease-causing full-mutation STR expansions and genomes simulated to harbor 
      repeat expansions at selected loci and optimized their sensitivity. We then used 
      a machine learning decision tree classifier to identify an optimal combination of 
      methods for full-mutation detection. In Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)-aligned 
      genomes, the ensemble approach of using ExpansionHunter, STRetch, and exSTRa 
      performed the best (precision = 82%, recall = 100%, F1-score = 90%). We applied 
      this pipeline to screen 301 families of children with suspected genetic 
      disorders. RESULTS: We identified 10 individuals with full-mutations in the AR, 
      ATXN1, ATXN8, DMPK, FXN, or HTT disease STR locus in the analyzed families. 
      Additional candidates identified in our analysis include two probands with 
      borderline ATXN2 expansions between the established repeat size range for 
      reduced-penetrance and full-penetrance full-mutation and seven individuals with 
      FMR1 CGG repeats in the intermediate/premutation repeat size range. In 67 
      probands with a prior negative clinical PCR test for the FMR1, FXN, or DMPK 
      disease STR locus, or the spinocerebellar ataxia disease STR panel, our pipeline 
      did not falsely identify aberrant expansion. We performed clinical PCR tests on 
      seven (out of 10) full-mutation samples identified by our pipeline and confirmed 
      the expansion status in all, showing absolute concordance between our 
      bioinformatics and molecular findings. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully 
      demonstrated the application of a well-optimized bioinformatics pipeline that 
      promotes the utility of genome-wide sequencing as a first-tier screening test to 
      detect expansions of known disease STRs. Interrogating clinical next-generation 
      sequencing data for pathogenic STR expansions using our ensemble pipeline can 
      improve diagnostic yield and enhance clinical outcomes for patients with repeat 
      expansion disorders.

      Excision of this CTG(exp) repeat using CRISPR-Cas resulted in the disappearance 
      of punctate ribonuclear foci in cardiomyocyte-like cells derived from DM1-induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This was associated with correction of the 
      underlying spliceopathy as determined by RNA sequencing and alternate splicing 
      analysis. Certain genes were of particular interest due to their role in cardiac 
      development, maturation, and function (TPM4, CYP2J2, DMD, MBNL3, CACNA1H, ROCK2, 
      ACTB) or their association with splicing (SMN2, GCFC2, MBNL3). Moreover, while 
      comparing isogenic CRISPR-Cas9-corrected versus non-corrected DM1 cardiomyocytes, 
      a prominent difference in the splicing pattern for a number of candidate genes 
      was apparent pertaining to genes that are associated with cardiac function (TNNT, 
      TNNT2, TTN, TPM1, SYNE1, CACNA1A, MTMR1, NEBL, TPM1), cellular signaling (NCOR2, 
      CLIP1, LRRFIP2, CLASP1, CAMK2G), and other DM1-related genes (i.e., NUMA1, MBNL2, 
      LDB3) in addition to the disease-causing DMPK gene itself. Subsequent validation 
      using a selected gene subset, including MBNL1, MBNL2, INSR, ADD3, and CRTC2, 
      further confirmed correction of the spliceopathy following CTG(exp) repeat 
      excision. To our knowledge, the present study provides the first comprehensive 
      unbiased transcriptome-wide analysis of the differential splicing landscape in 
      DM1 patient-derived cardiac cells after excision of the CTG(exp) repeat using 
      CRISPR-Cas9, showing reversal of the abnormal cardiac spliceopathy in DM1.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant multisystemic disorder 
      caused by unstable CTG-repeat expansions in the DMPK gene. Tissue mosaicism has 
      been described for the length of these repeat expansions. The most obvious 
      affected tissue is skeletal muscle, making it the first target for therapy 
      development. To date there is no approved therapy despite some existing 
      approaches. Thus, there is the demand to further advance therapeutic 
      developments, which will in return require several well-characterized preclinical 
      tools and model systems. Here we describe a modified method to identify the 
      CTG-repeat length in primary human myoblasts isolated from DM1 patients that 
      requires less genomic DNA and avoids radioactive labeling. Using this method, we 
      show that primary human DM1 myoblast cultures represent a population of cells 
      with different CTG-repeat length. Comparing DNA from the identical muscle biopsy 
      specimen, the range of CTG-repeat length in the myoblast culture is within the 
      same range of the muscle biopsy specimen. In conclusion, primary human DM1 
      myoblast cultures are a well-suited model to investigate certain aspects of the 
      DM1 pathology. They are a useful platform to perform first-line investigations of 
      preclinical therapies.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystemic neuromuscular disorder that is 
      inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. DM1 originates in a (CTG...CAG) repeat 
      expansion in the 3'-UTR of the dystrophia myotonic protein kinase (DMPK) gene on 
      chromosome 19. One of the transcripts, r(CUG)(exp) , is toxic in various ways. 
      Herein we report a rationally designed small molecule with a thiazole 
      peptidomimetic unit that can serve as a minor groove binder for the nucleic acid 
      targets. This peptide unit linked to two triaminotriazine recognition units 
      selectively binds to d(CTG)(exp) to inhibit the transcription process, and also 
      targets r(CUG)(exp) selectively to improve representative DM1 pathological 
      molecular features, including foci formation and pre-mRNA splicing defects in DM1 
      model cells. As such, it represents a new structure type that might serve as a 
      lead compound for future structure-activity optimization.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by a 
      non-coding CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene. This mutation generates a toxic 
      CUG RNA that interferes with the RNA processing of target genes in multiple 
      tissues. Despite debilitating neurological impairment, the pathophysiological 
      cascade of molecular and cellular events in the central nervous system (CNS) has 
      been less extensively characterized than the molecular pathogenesis of 
      muscle/cardiac dysfunction. Particularly, the contribution of different cell 
      types to DM1 brain disease is not clearly understood. We first used 
      transcriptomics to compare the impact of expanded CUG RNA on the transcriptome of 
      primary neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes derived from DMSXL mice, a 
      transgenic model of DM1. RNA sequencing revealed more frequent expression and 
      splicing changes in glia than neuronal cells. In particular, primary DMSXL 
      oligodendrocytes showed the highest number of transcripts differentially 
      expressed, while DMSXL astrocytes displayed the most severe splicing 
      dysregulation. Interestingly, the expression and splicing defects of DMSXL glia 
      recreated molecular signatures suggestive of impaired cell differentiation: while 
      DMSXL oligodendrocytes failed to upregulate a subset of genes that are naturally 
      activated during the oligodendroglia differentiation, a significant proportion of 
      missplicing events in DMSXL oligodendrocytes and astrocytes increased the 
      expression of RNA isoforms typical of precursor cell stages. Together these data 
      suggest that expanded CUG RNA in glial cells affects preferentially 
      differentiation-regulated molecular events. This hypothesis was corroborated by 
      gene ontology (GO) analyses, which revealed an enrichment for biological 
      processes and cellular components with critical roles during cell 
      differentiation. Finally, we combined exon ontology with phosphoproteomics and 
      cell imaging to explore the functional impact of CUG-associated spliceopathy on 
      downstream protein metabolism. Changes in phosphorylation, protein isoform 
      expression and intracellular localization in DMSXL astrocytes demonstrate the 
      far-reaching impact of the DM1 repeat expansion on cell metabolism. Our 
      multi-omics approaches provide insight into the mechanisms of CUG RNA toxicity in 
      the CNS with cell type resolution, and support the priority for future research 
      on non-neuronal mechanisms and proteomic changes in DM1 brain disease.

LID - 10.3233/JND-200558 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is the most common monogenetic muscular disorder 
      of adulthood. This multisystemic disease is caused by CTG repeat expansion in the 
      3'-untranslated region of the DM1 protein kinase gene called DMPK. DMPK encodes a 
      myosin kinase expressed in skeletal muscle cells and other cellular populations 
      such as smooth muscle cells, neurons and fibroblasts. The resultant expanded 
      (CUG)n RNA transcripts sequester RNA binding factors leading to ubiquitous and 
      persistent splicing deregulation. The accumulation of mutant CUG repeats is 
      linked to increased activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta), a highly 
      conserved and ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase with functions in pathways 
      regulating inflammation, metabolism, oncogenesis, neurogenesis and myogenesis. As 
      GSK3beta-inhibition ameliorates defects in myogenesis, muscle strength and myotonia 
      in a DM1 mouse model, this kinase represents a key player of DM1 
      pathobiochemistry and constitutes a promising therapeutic target. To better 
      characterise DM1 patients, and monitor treatment responses, we aimed to define a 
      set of robust disease and severity markers linked to GSK3betaby unbiased proteomic 
      profiling utilizing fibroblasts derived from DM1 patients with low (80- 150) and 
      high (2600- 3600) CTG-repeats. Apart from GSK3beta increase, we identified 
      dysregulation of nine proteins (CAPN1, CTNNB1, CTPS1, DNMT1, HDAC2, HNRNPH3, 
      MAP2K2, NR3C1, VDAC2) modulated by GSK3beta. In silico-based expression studies 
      confirmed expression in neuronal and skeletal muscle cells and revealed a 
      relatively elevated abundance in fibroblasts. The potential impact of each marker 
      in the myopathology of DM1 is discussed based on respective function to inform 
      potential uses as severity markers or for monitoring GSK3beta inhibitor treatment 
      responses.

TI  - High throughput screening for expanded CTG repeats in myotonic dystrophy type 1 
      using melt curve analysis.
PG  - e1619

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by CTG repeat expansions in 
      the DMPK gene and is the most common form of muscular dystrophy. Patients can 
      have long delays from onset to diagnosis, since clinical signs and symptoms are 
      often nonspecific and overlapping with other disorders. Clinical genetic testing 
      by Southern blot or triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) is technically challenging and 
      cost prohibitive for population surveys. METHODS: Here, we present a high 
      throughput, low-cost screening tool for CTG repeat expansions using TP-PCR 
      followed by high resolution melt curve analysis with saturating concentrations of 
      SYBR GreenER dye. RESULTS: We determined that multimodal melt profiles from the 
      TP-PCR assay are a proxy for amplicon length stoichiometry. In a screen of 10,097 
      newborn blood spots, melt profile analysis accurately reflected the tri-modal 
      distribution of common alleles from 5 to 35 CTG repeats, and identified the 
      premutation and full expansion alleles. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that robust 
      detection of expanded CTG repeats in a single tube can be achieved from samples 
      derived from specimens with minimal template DNA such as dried blood spots (DBS). 
      This technique is readily adaptable to large-scale testing programs such as 
      population studies and newborn screening programs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Myotonic dystrophy is a multisystem disorder caused by a trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion on the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene. To 
      determine whether wildtype DMPK expression patterns vary as a function of age, we 
      analyzed DMPK expression in the brain from 99 donors ranging from 5 
      postconceptional weeks to 80 years old. METHODS: We used the BrainSpan messenger 
      RNA sequencing and the Yale Microarray data sets, which included brain tissue 
      samples from 42 and 57 donors, respectively. Collectively, donors ranged in age 
      from 5 postconceptional weeks to 80 years old. DMPK expression was normalized for 
      each donor across regions available in both data sets. Restricted cubic spline 
      linear regression models were used to analyze the effects of log-transformed age 
      and sex on normalized DMPK expression data. RESULTS: Age was a statistically 
      significant predictor of normalized DMPK expression pattern in the human brain in 
      the BrainSpan (p < 0.005) and Yale data sets (p < 0.005). Sex was not a 
      significant predictor. Across both data sets, normalized wildtype DMPK expression 
      steadily increases during fetal development, peaks around birth, and then 
      declines to reach a nadir around age 10. CONCLUSIONS: Peak expression of DMPK 
      coincides with a time of dynamic brain development. Abnormal brain DMPK 
      expression due to myotonic dystrophy may have implications for early brain 
      development.

AB  - The range of genetic variation with potential clinical implications in 
      schizophrenia, beyond rare copy number variants (CNVs), remains uncertain. We 
      therefore analyzed genome sequencing data for 259 unrelated adults with 
      schizophrenia from a well-characterized community-based cohort previously 
      examined with chromosomal microarray for CNVs (none with 22q11.2 deletions). We 
      analyzed these genomes for rare high-impact variants considered causal for 
      neurodevelopmental disorders, including single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 
      small insertions/deletions (indels), for potential clinical relevance based on 
      findings for neurodevelopmental disorders. Also, we investigated a novel variant 
      type, tandem repeat expansions (TREs), in 45 loci known to be associated with 
      monogenic neurological diseases. We found several of these variants in this 
      schizophrenia population suggesting that these variants have a wider clinical 
      spectrum than previously thought. In addition to known pathogenic CNVs, we 
      identified 11 (4.3%) individuals with clinically relevant SNVs/indels in genes 
      converging on schizophrenia-relevant pathways. Clinical yield was significantly 
      enriched in females and in those with broadly defined learning/intellectual 
      disabilities. Genome analyses also identified variants with potential clinical 
      implications, including TREs (one in DMPK; two in ATXN8OS) and ultra-rare 
      loss-of-function SNVs in ZMYM2 (a novel candidate gene for schizophrenia). Of the 
      233 individuals with no pathogenic CNVs, we identified rare high-impact variants 
      (i.e., clinically relevant or with potential clinical implications) for 14 
      individuals (6.0%); some had multiple rare high-impact variants. Mean 
      schizophrenia polygenic risk score was similar between individuals with and 
      without clinically relevant rare genetic variation; common variants were not 
      sufficient for clinical application. These findings broaden the individual and 
      global picture of clinically relevant genetic risk in schizophrenia, and suggest 
      the potential translational value of genome sequencing as a single genetic 
      technology for schizophrenia.

TI  - Reversible cardiac disease features in an inducible CUG repeat RNA-expressing 
      mouse model of myotonic dystrophy.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK 
      gene. Expression of pathogenic expanded CUG repeat (CUGexp) RNA causes 
      multisystemic disease by perturbing the functions of RNA-binding proteins, 
      resulting in expression of fetal protein isoforms in adult tissues. Cardiac 
      involvement affects 50% of individuals with DM1 and causes 25% of disease-related 
      deaths. We developed a transgenic mouse model for tetracycline-inducible and 
      heart-specific expression of human DMPK mRNA containing 960 CUG repeats. CUGexp 
      RNA is expressed in atria and ventricles and induced mice exhibit 
      electrophysiological and molecular features of DM1 disease, including cardiac 
      conduction delays, supraventricular arrhythmias, nuclear RNA foci with 
      Muscleblind protein colocalization, and alternative splicing defects. 
      Importantly, these phenotypes were rescued upon loss of CUGexp RNA expression. 
      Transcriptome analysis revealed gene expression and alternative splicing changes 
      in ion transport genes that are associated with inherited cardiac conduction 
      diseases, including a subset of genes involved in calcium handling. Consistent 
      with RNA-Seq results, calcium-handling defects were identified in atrial 
      cardiomyocytes isolated from mice expressing CUGexp RNA. These results identify 
      potential tissue-specific mechanisms contributing to cardiac pathogenesis in DM1 
      and demonstrate the utility of reversible phenotypes in our model to facilitate 
      development of targeted therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an incurable neuromuscular disorder caused by 
      toxic DMPK transcripts that carry CUG repeat expansions in the 3' untranslated 
      region (3'UTR). The intrinsic complexity and lack of crystallographic data makes 
      noncoding RNA regions challenging targets to study in the field of drug 
      discovery. In DM1, toxic transcripts tend to stall in the nuclei forming complex 
      inclusion bodies called foci and sequester many essential alternative splicing 
      factors such as Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1). Most DM1 phenotypic features stem 
      from the reduced availability of free MBNL1 and therefore many therapeutic 
      efforts are focused on recovering its normal activity. For that purpose, herein 
      we present pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-(8H)-ones, a privileged scaffold showing 
      remarkable biological activity against many targets involved in human disorders 
      including cancer and viral diseases. Their combination with a flexible linker 
      meets the requirements to stabilise DM1 toxic transcripts, and therefore, 
      enabling the release of MBNL1. Therefore, a set of novel 
      pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-(8H)-ones derivatives (1a-e) were obtained using click 
      chemistry. 1a exerted over 20% MBNL1 recovery on DM1 toxic RNA activity in 
      primary cell biology studies using patient-derived myoblasts. 1a promising anti 
      DM1 activity may lead to subsequent generations of ligands, highlighting a new 
      affordable treatment against DM1.

AB  - Cas13a, an effector of type VI CRISPR-Cas systems, is an RNA guided RNase with 
      multiplexing and therapeutic potential. This study employs the Leptotrichia 
      shahii (Lsh) Cas13a and a repeat-based CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to track and eliminate 
      toxic RNA aggregates in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) - a neuromuscular disease 
      caused by CTG expansion in the DMPK gene. We demonstrate that LshCas13a cleaves 
      CUG repeat RNA in biochemical assays and reduces toxic RNA load in 
      patient-derived myoblasts. As a result, LshCas13a reverses the characteristic 
      adult-to-embryonic missplicing events in several key genes that contribute to DM1 
      phenotype. The deactivated LshCas13a can further be repurposed to track RNA-rich 
      organelles within cells. Our data highlights the reprogrammability of LshCas13a 
      and the possible use of Cas13a to target expanded repeat sequences in 
      microsatellite expansion diseases.

      haplotyping: application in various diseases.
PG  - 463-470
LID - 10.1038/s41431-020-00759-9 [doi]
AB  - Direct haplotyping enables noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) without analyzing 
      proband, which is a promising strategy for pregnancies at risk of an inherited 
      single-gene disorder. Here, we aimed to expand the scope of single-gene disorders 
      that NIPT using linked-read direct haplotyping would be applicable to. Three 
      families at risk of myotonic dystrophy type 1, lipoid congenital adrenal 
      hyperplasia, and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy were recruited. All cases 
      exhibited distinct characteristics that are often encountered as hurdles (i.e., 
      repeat expansion, identical variants in both parents, and novel variants with 
      retrotransposon insertion) in the universal clinical application of NIPT. Direct 
      haplotyping of parental genomes was performed by linked-read sequencing, combined 
      with allele-specific PCR, if necessary. Target DMPK, STAR, and FKTN genes in the 
      maternal plasma DNA were sequenced. Posterior risk calculations and an 
      Anderson-Darling test were performed to deduce the maternal and paternal 
      inheritance, respectively. In all cases, we could predict the inheritance of 
      maternal mutant allele with > 99.9% confidence, while paternal mutant alleles 
      were not predicted to be inherited. Our study indicates that direct haplotyping 
      and posterior risk calculation can be applied with subtle modifications to NIPT 
      for the detection of an expanded range of diseases.

TI  - The sustained expression of Cas9 targeting toxic RNAs reverses disease phenotypes 
      in mouse models of myotonic dystrophy type 1.
PG  - 157-168
LID - 10.1038/s41551-020-00607-7 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) is a multisystemic autosomal-dominant inherited 
      human disorder that is caused by CTG microsatellite repeat expansions (MREs) in 
      the 3' untranslated region of DMPK. Toxic RNAs expressed from such repetitive 
      sequences can be eliminated using CRISPR-mediated RNA targeting, yet evidence of 
      its in vivo efficacy and durability is lacking. Here, using adult and neonatal 
      mouse models of DM1, we show that intramuscular or systemic injections of 
      adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors encoding nuclease-dead Cas9 and a 
      single-guide RNA targeting CUG repeats results in the expression of the 
      RNA-targeting Cas9 for up to three months, redistribution of the RNA-splicing 
      protein muscleblind-like splicing regulator 1, elimination of foci of toxic RNA, 
      reversal of splicing biomarkers and amelioration of myotonia. The sustained 
      reversal of DM1 phenotypes provides further support that RNA-targeting Cas9 is a 
      viable strategy for treating DM1 and other MRE-associated diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that variant repeat interruptions (RIs) 
      within the DMPK CTG repeat tract lead to milder symptoms compared with pure 
      repeats (PRs) in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). METHODS: We evaluated motor, 
      neurocognitive, and behavioral outcomes in a group of 6 participants with DM1 
      with RI compared with a case-matched sample of 12 participants with DM1 with PR 
      and a case-matched sample of 12 unaffected healthy comparison participants (UA). 
      RESULTS: In every measure, the RI participants were intermediate between UA and 
      PR participants. For muscle strength, the RI group was significantly less 
      impaired than the PR group. For measures of Full Scale IQ, depression, and 
      sleepiness, all 3 groups were significantly different from each other with UA > 
      RI > PR in order of impairment. The RI group was different from unaffected, but 
      not significantly different from PR (UA > RI = PR) in apathy and working memory. 
      Finally, in finger tapping and processing speed, RI did not differ from UA 
      comparisons, but PR had significantly lower scores than the UA comparisons (UA = 
      RI > PR). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the notion that patients affected by 
      DM1 with RI demonstrate a milder phenotype with the same pattern of deficits as 
      those with PR indicating a similar disease process.

TI  - Stable Longitudinal Methylation Levels at the CpG Sites Flanking the CTG Repeat 
      of DMPK in Patients with Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1.
LID - 10.3390/genes11080936 [doi]
LID - 936
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder 
      mainly characterized by gradual muscle loss, weakness, and delayed relaxation 
      after muscle contraction. It is caused by an expanded CTG repeat in the 3' UTR of 
      DMPK, which is transcribed into a toxic gain-of-function mRNA that affects the 
      splicing of a range of other genes. The repeat is unstable, with a bias towards 
      expansions both in somatic cells and in the germline, which results in a tendency 
      for earlier onset with each generation, as longer repeat lengths generally 
      correlate with earlier onset. Previous studies have found hypermethylation in the 
      regions flanking the repeat in congenital onset DM1 and in some patients with 
      non-congenital DM1. We used pyrosequencing to investigate blood methylation 
      levels in 68 patients with non-congenital DM1, compare the methylation levels 
      between the blood and muscle, and assess whether methylation levels change over 
      time in the blood. We found higher methylation levels in the blood of DM1 
      patients than in healthy controls and especially in the patients who had 
      inherited the disease allele maternally. The methylation levels remained 
      relatively stable over time and are a strong biomarker of the disease, as well as 
      of the maternal inheritance of the disease.

TI  - Genome-wide detection of tandem DNA repeats that are expanded in autism.
PG  - 80-86
LID - 10.1038/s41586-020-2579-z [doi]
AB  - Tandem DNA repeats vary in the size and sequence of each unit (motif). When 
      expanded, these tandem DNA repeats have been associated with more than 40 
      monogenic disorders(1). Their involvement in disorders with complex genetics is 
      largely unknown, as is the extent of their heterogeneity. Here we investigated 
      the genome-wide characteristics of tandem repeats that had motifs with a length 
      of 2-20 base pairs in 17,231 genomes of families containing individuals with 
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD)(2,3) and population control individuals(4). We 
      found extensive polymorphism in the size and sequence of motifs. Many of the 
      tandem repeat loci that we detected correlated with cytogenetic fragile sites. At 
      2,588 loci, gene-associated expansions of tandem repeats that were rare among 
      population control individuals were significantly more prevalent among 
      individuals with ASD than their siblings without ASD, particularly in exons and 
      near splice junctions, and in genes related to the development of the nervous 
      system and cardiovascular system or muscle. Rare tandem repeat expansions had a 
      prevalence of 23.3% in children with ASD compared with 20.7% in children without 
      ASD, which suggests that tandem repeat expansions make a collective contribution 
      to the risk of ASD of 2.6%. These rare tandem repeat expansions included 
      previously undescribed ASD-linked expansions in DMPK and FXN, which are 
      associated with neuromuscular conditions, and in previously unknown loci such as 
      FGF14 and CACNB1. Rare tandem repeat expansions were associated with lower IQ and 
      adaptive ability. Our results show that tandem DNA repeat expansions contribute 
      strongly to the genetic aetiology and phenotypic complexity of ASD.

TI  - Three-dimensional chromatin interactions remain stable upon CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansion.
PG  - eaaz4012

LID - eaaz4012
AB  - Expanded CAG/CTG repeats underlie 13 neurological disorders, including myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and Huntington's disease (HD). Upon expansion, disease 
      loci acquire heterochromatic characteristics, which may provoke changes to 
      chromatin conformation and thereby affect both gene expression and repeat 
      instability. Here, we tested this hypothesis by performing 4C sequencing at the 
      DMPK and HTT loci from DM1 and HD-derived cells. We find that allele sizes 
      ranging from 15 to 1700 repeats displayed similar chromatin interaction profiles. 
      This was true for both loci and for alleles with different DNA methylation levels 
      and CTCF binding. Moreover, the ectopic insertion of an expanded CAG repeat tract 
      did not change the conformation of the surrounding chromatin. We conclude that 
      CAG/CTG repeat expansions are not enough to alter chromatin conformation in cis. 
      Therefore, it is unlikely that changes in chromatin interactions drive repeat 
      instability or changes in gene expression in these disorders.

TI  - Identification, molecular characterization and segregation analysis of a variant 
      DMPK pre-mutation allele in a three-generation Italian family.
PG  - 13-18
LID - 10.36185/2532-1900-002 [doi]
AB  - DM1 is an autosomal dominant multisystemic disease caused by an unstable CTG 
      repeat expansion in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the DMPK gene. The 
      complex variant DMPK expanded the alleles containing CAG, CCG, CTC and/or GGC 
      interruptions repetition sequences have been reported in 3-8% of DM1 patients. To 
      date, very few information is available about the frequency and clinical 
      consequences of pre-mutated DMPK variant allele. In this study, we describe a 
      three-generation Italian family showing the segregation of an interrupted DMPK 
      allele within the premutation range. TP-PCR with primers complementary to CCG 
      repetitions and direct sequencing allow us to identify a hetero-triplet 
      (CTG)(6)(CCGCTG)(15)(CTG)(5) repeat structure. The haplotype analysis 
      demonstrated that this variant allele is associated with the European founder DM1 
      haplotype. The pyrosequencing analysis of the CpG islands contained in the 
      flanking regions of the CTG array, did not show the presence of a cis effect of 
      the CCG interruptions on the methylation profile of the DM1 locus. The analysis 
      of both meiotic transmissions, one maternal and one paternal, revealed the 
      intrafamilial stability of the DM1 premutation among relatives. Our findings 
      further support the hypothesis of a stabilizing effect of CCG interruptions on 
      the mutational dynamics of the DM1 locus, also in intermediate DMPK alleles.

TI  - CDK12 inhibition reduces abnormalities in cells from patients with myotonic 
      dystrophy and in a mouse model.
LID - eaaz2415 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.aaz2415 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an RNA-based disease with no current 
      treatment. It is caused by a transcribed CTG repeat expansion within the 3' 
      untranslated region of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene. 
      Mutant repeat expansion transcripts remain in the nuclei of patients' cells, 
      forming distinct microscopically detectable foci that contribute substantially to 
      the pathophysiology of the condition. Here, we report small-molecule inhibitors 
      that remove nuclear foci and have beneficial effects in the HSA(LR) mouse model, 
      reducing transgene expression, leading to improvements in myotonia, splicing, and 
      centralized nuclei. Using chemoproteomics in combination with cell-based assays, 
      we identify cyclin-dependent kinase 12 (CDK12) as a druggable target for this 
      condition. CDK12 is a protein elevated in DM1 cell lines and patient muscle 
      biopsies, and our results showed that its inhibition led to reduced expression of 
      repeat expansion RNA. Some of the inhibitors identified in this study are 
      currently the subject of clinical trials for other indications and provide 
      valuable starting points for a drug development program in DM1.

TI  - Parental repeat length instability in myotonic dystrophy type 1 pre- and 
      protomutations.
PG  - 956-962

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by a CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      on chromosome 19q13.3. While DM1 premutation (36-50 repeats) and protomutation 
      (51-80 repeats) allele carriers are mostly asymptomatic, offspring is at risk of 
      inheriting expanded, symptom-associated, (CTG)n repeats of n > 80. In this study 
      we aimed to evaluate the intergenerational instability of DM1 pre- and 
      protomutation alleles, focussing on the influence of parental gender. One hundred 
      and forty-six parent-child pairs (34 parental premutations, 112 protomutations) 
      were retrospectively selected from the DM1 patient cohort of the Maastricht 
      University Medical Center+. CTG repeat size of parents and children was 
      determined by (triplet-primed) PCR followed by fragment length analysis and 
      Southern blot analysis. Fifty-eight out of eighty-one (71.6%) paternal 
      transmissions led to a (CTG)n repeat of n > 80 in offspring, compared with 15 out 
      of 65 (23.1%) maternal transmissions (p < 0.001). Repeat length instability 
      occurred for paternal (CTG)n repeats of n >/= 45, while maternal instability did 
      not occur until (CTG)n repeats reached a length of n >/= 71. Transmission of 
      premutations caused (CTG)n repeats of n > 80 in offspring only when paternally 
      transmitted (two cases), while protomutations caused (CTG)n repeats of n > 80 in 
      offspring in 71 cases, of which 56 (78.9%) were paternally transmitted. In 
      conclusion, our data show that paternally transmitted pre- and protomutations 
      were more unstable than maternally transmitted pre- and protomutations. For 
      genetic counseling, this implies that males with a small DMPK mutation have a 
      higher risk of symptomatic offspring compared with females. Consequently, we 
      suggest addressing sex-dependent factors in genetic counseling of small-sized CTG 
      repeat carriers.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystemic genetic disorder caused by the 
      CTG repeat expansion in the 3'-untranslated region of DMPK gene. Heart 
      dysfunctions occur in  approximately 80% of DM1 patients and are the second leading cause of 
      DM1-related deaths. Herein, we report that upregulation of a non-muscle splice 
      isoform of RNA-binding protein RBFOX2 in DM1 heart tissue-due to altered splicing 
      factor and microRNA activities-induces cardiac conduction defects in DM1 
      individuals. Mice engineered to express the non-muscle RBFOX2(40) isoform in 
      heart via tetracycline-inducible transgenesis, or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome 
      editing, reproduced DM1-related cardiac conduction delay and spontaneous episodes 
      of arrhythmia. Further, by integrating RNA binding with cardiac transcriptome 
      datasets from DM1 patients and mice expressing the non-muscle RBFOX2 isoform, we 
      identified RBFOX2(40)-driven splicing defects in voltage-gated sodium and 
      potassium channels, which alter their electrophysiological properties. Thus, our 
      results uncover a trans-dominant role for an aberrantly expressed RBFOX2(40) 
      isoform in DM1 cardiac pathogenesis.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant inherited muscular 
      dystrophy caused by an expanded CTG repeat in the dystrophia myotonica protein 
      kinase (DMPK) gene. Cardiac involvements in DM1 are characterized by cardiac 
      conduction delays and atrial or ventricular tachycardia, which increase the risk 
      of sudden cardiac death when compared with general population. Only a few reports 
      have investigated the association between DM1 and inherited arrhythmias, 
      including Brugada syndrome and a splicing abnormality of the SCN5A gene, encodes 
      the alpha-subunit of cardiac voltage-gated Na+ channels. Here we report a 24-year-old 
      male patient with progressive grip myotonia and dysphagia, who was genetically 
      diagnosed with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) caused by a novel 
      V1764fsX1786 frameshift mutation in the SCN5A gene at the age of 18 years. Family 
      history was negative for arrhythmia, cardiac sudden death, and neuromuscular 
      disorders. Genetic analysis using the Southern blot technique revealed 350 CTG 
      repeats in the DMPK gene. This is the first case of DM1 with genetically 
      confirmed overlapping CTG repeat expansion and a V1764fsX1786 frameshift mutation 
      in the SCN5A gene. Our case suggests that a loss-of-function in the cardiac 
      sodium channel may contribute to the cardiac complications in DM1 patients.

TI  - CTG Expansion in the DMPK Gene: Semen Quality Assessment and Outcome of 
      Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis.
LID - dgaa041 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgaa041 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized 
      mainly by myotonia but also by primary hypogonadism. No study has reported on 
      fertility management of patients affected by DM type 1 (DM1). OBJECTIVE: This 
      study investigates the impact of CTG repeats in the DMPK gene on semen quality 
      and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) outcome. DESIGN: This is a 
      monocentric retrospective observational study conducted from January 2003 to 
      January 2019. SETTING: Antoine Beclere University Hospital, Clamart, France. 
      PATIENTS: Three groups were compared in this study: male DM1 patients (Group A, n 
      = 18), unaffected partners of DM1 female patients (Group B, n = 30), and proven 
      fertile men (Group C, n = 33). Reproductive outcomes after PGD were compared 
      between groups A and B. RESULTS: Sperm volume was reduced in group A (2.0 mL) 
      when compared with groups B (3.0 mL; P < 0.01) and C (3.5 mL; P < 0.01). 
      Progressive motility in raw sperm was also decreased in group A (30%) as compared 
      to group C (40%; P < 0.01). The median number of progressive spermatozoa 
      retrieved after sperm preparation was 2.7 million (M) in group A, which was 
      significantly less than those of groups B (10.0 M; P < 0.01) and C (62.2 M; P < 
      0.01). Sperm motility was inversely correlated to the number of CTG repeats 
      (Spearman r2 = 0.48, Pearson r2 = 0.35). Cumulative live birth rate per transfer 
      was similar between groups, with 32.2% in group A versus 26.8% in group B. 
      CONCLUSIONS: As a precautionary measure, we advise physicians to perform regular 
      monitoring of semen quality in affected males, which would allow sperm 
      cryopreservation should semen parameters fall. PGD allows good reproductive 
      outcomes without disease transmission.

TI  - Systemic Evaluation of Chimeric LNA/2'-O-Methyl Steric Blockers for Myotonic 
      Dystrophy Type 1 Therapy.
PG  - 80-93
LID - 10.1089/nat.2019.0811 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a dominantly inherited, multisystemic disorder 
      characterized clinically by delayed muscle relaxation and weakness. The disease 
      is caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of the 
      DMPK gene, which leads to the expression of a toxic gain-of-function mRNA. The 
      expanded CUG repeat mRNA sequesters the MBNL1 splicing regulator in 
      nuclear-retained foci structures, resulting in loss of protein function and 
      disruption of alternative splicing homeostasis. In this study, we used CAG repeat 
      antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), composed of locked nucleic acid (LNA)- and 
      2'-O-methyl (2'OMe)-modified bases in a chimeric design, to alleviate 
      CUG(expanded)-mediated toxicity. Chimeric 14-18mer LNA/2'OMe oligonucleotides, 
      exhibiting an LNA incorporation of  approximately 33%, significantly ameliorated the 
      misregulated alternative splicing of Mbnl1-dependent exons in primary DM1 mouse 
      myoblasts and tibialis anterior muscles of DM1 mice. Subcutaneous delivery of 
      14mer and 18mer LNA/2'OMe chimeras in DM1 mice resulted in high levels of 
      accumulation in all tested skeletal muscles, as well as in the diaphragm and 
      heart tissue. Despite the efficient delivery, chimeric LNA/2'OMe oligonucleotides 
      were not able, even at a high-dosage regimen (400 mg/kg/week), to correct the 
      misregulated splicing of Serca1 exon 22 in skeletal muscles. Nevertheless, 
      oligonucleotide doses were well-tolerated as determined by histological and 
      plasma biochemistry analyses. Our results provide proof of concept that 
      inhibition of MBNL1 sequestration by systemic delivery of a steric-blocking ASO 
      is extremely challenging, considering the large number of target sites that need 
      to be occupied per RNA molecule. Although not suitable for DM1 therapy, chimeric 
      LNA/2'OMe oligonucleotides could prove to be highly beneficial for other 
      diseases, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, that require inhibition of a 
      single target site per RNA molecule.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case with Myotonic dystrophy type I with successful 
      preimplantation genetic diagnosis-karyomapping. CASE REPORT: A 34-year-old female 
      carrier of myotonic dystrophy type I was treated at our clinic with a successful 
      pregnancy after preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders using 
      karyomapping of her blastocysts. CONCLUSION: Myotonic dystrophy type I is an 
      inherited autosomal dominant disease producing various neuromuscular 
      disturbances. Offspring of carriers have a 50% chance of carrying CTG repeat 
      sequences in the DMPK gene, and various time-consuming methodologies have been 
      developed for genetic diagnosis. With a novel, efficient, and precise method by 
      karyomapping using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays to diagnose single gene 
      disorders, one could terminate the transmission of single gene disorder. Herein, 
      we reported a 34-year-old female carrier of myotonic dystrophy type I achieve a 
      successful pregnancy after preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic 
      disorders using karyomapping method of her blastocysts.

      with Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1.
PG  - 120-132
LID - 10.1016/j.omtm.2019.09.002 [doi]
AB  - Pericytes are multipotent, vessel-associated progenitors that exhibit high 
      proliferative capacity, can cross the blood-muscle barrier, and have the ability 
      to home to muscle tissue and contribute to myogenesis. Consequently, 
      pericyte-based therapies hold great promise for muscular dystrophies. A complex 
      multi-system disorder exhibiting muscular dystrophy for which pericytes might be 
      a valuable cell source is myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). DM1 is caused by an 
      unstable (CTG)n repeat in the DMPK gene and characterized by skeletal muscle 
      weakness, muscle wasting, and myotonia. We have successfully isolated alkaline 
      phosphatase-positive pericytes from skeletal muscle of DM1 patients and a 
      transgenic mouse model. Intranuclear (CUG)n RNA foci, a pathogenic DM1 hallmark, 
      were identified in human and mouse pericytes. Notably, pericytes from DM1 
      patients maintained similar growth parameters and innate myogenic characteristics 
      in vitro compared to cells from unaffected controls. Our in vitro results thus 
      demonstrate the potential of pericytes to ameliorate muscle features in DM1 in a 
      therapeutic setting.

AB  - Short tandem repeats (STRs) are prone to expansion mutations that cause multiple 
      hereditary neurological and neuromuscular diseases. To study pathomechanisms 
      using mouse models that recapitulate the tissue specificity and developmental 
      timing of an STR expansion gene, we used rolling circle amplification and 
      CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to generate Dmpk CTG expansion (CTG(exp)) 
      knockin models of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). We demonstrate that skeletal 
      muscle myoblasts and brain choroid plexus epithelial cells are particularly 
      susceptible to Dmpk CTG(exp) mutations and RNA missplicing. Our results implicate 
      dysregulation of muscle regeneration and cerebrospinal fluid homeostasis as early 
      pathogenic events in DM1.

TI  - A CTG repeat-selective chemical screen identifies microtubule inhibitors as 
      selective modulators of toxic CUG RNA levels.

AB  - A CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene is the causative mutation of myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Transcription of the expanded CTG repeat produces toxic 
      gain-of-function CUG RNA, leading to disease symptoms. A screening platform that 
      targets production or stability of the toxic CUG RNA in a selective manner has 
      the potential to provide new biological and therapeutic insights. A DM1 HeLa cell 
      model was generated that stably expresses a toxic r(CUG)480 and an analogous 
      r(CUG)0 control from DMPK and was used to measure the ratio-metric level of 
      r(CUG)480 versus r(CUG)0. This DM1 HeLa model recapitulates pathogenic hallmarks 
      of DM1, including CUG ribonuclear foci and missplicing of pre-mRNA targets of the 
      muscleblind (MBNL) alternative splicing factors. Repeat-selective screening using 
      this cell line led to the unexpected identification of multiple microtubule 
      inhibitors as hits that selectively reduce r(CUG)480 levels and partially rescue 
      MBNL-dependent missplicing. These results were validated by using the Food and 
      Drug Administration-approved clinical microtubule inhibitor colchicine in DM1 
      mouse and primary patient cell models. The mechanism of action was found to 
      involve selective reduced transcription of the CTG expansion that we hypothesize 
      to involve the LINC (linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton) complex. The 
      unanticipated identification of microtubule inhibitors as selective modulators of 
      toxic CUG RNA opens research directions for this form of muscular dystrophy and 
      may shed light on the biology of CTG repeat expansion and inform therapeutic 
      avenues. This approach has the potential to identify modulators of expanded 
      repeat-containing gene expression for over 30 microsatellite expansion disorders.

TI  - Genetic determinants of disease severity in the myotonic dystrophy type 1

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of genetic variation at the DMPK locus on 
      symptomatic diversity in 250 adult, ambulant patients with myotonic dystrophy 
      type 1 (DM1) recruited to the Observational Prolonged Trial in Myotonic Dystrophy 
      Type 1 to Improve Quality of Life-Standards, a Target Identification 
      Collaboration (OPTIMISTIC) clinical trial. METHODS: We used small pool PCR to 
      correct age at sampling biases and estimate the progenitor allele CTG repeat 
      length and somatic mutational dynamics, and AciI digests and repeat primed PCR to 
      test for the presence of variant repeats. RESULTS: We confirmed disease severity 
      is driven by progenitor allele length, is further modified by age, and, in some 
      cases, sex, and that patients in whom the CTG repeat expands more rapidly in the 
      soma develop symptoms earlier than predicted. We revealed a key role for variant 
      repeats in reducing disease severity and quantified their role in delaying age at 
      onset by approximately 13.2 years (95% confidence interval 5.7-20.7, 2-tailed t 
      test t = -3.7, p = 0.0019). CONCLUSIONS: Careful characterization of the DMPK CTG 
      repeat to define progenitor allele length and presence of variant repeats has 
      increased utility in understanding clinical variability in a trial cohort and 
      provides a genetic route for defining disease-specific outcome measures, and the 
      basis of treatment response and stratification in DM1 trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) 
      DNA methylation (DNAme) epivariation on muscular and respiratory profiles in 
      patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). METHODS: Phenotypes were assessed 
      with standardized measures. Pyrosequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA was used to 
      quantify DNAme levels in blood from 90 patients with DM1 (adult form). Modal CTG 
      repeat length was assessed using small-pool PCR. The presence of Acil-sensitive 
      variant repeats was also tested. RESULTS: DNAme levels upstream of the CTG 
      expansion (exon and intron 11) were correlated with modal CTG repeat length (r(s) 
      = -0.224, p = 0.040; r(s) = -0.317, p = 0.003; and r(s) = -0.241, p = 0.027), 
      whereas correlations were observed with epivariations downstream of the CTG 
      repeats (r(s) = 0.227; p = 0.037). The presence of a variant repeat was 
      associated with higher DNAme levels at multiple CpG sites (up to 10% higher; p = 
      0.001). Stepwise multiple linear regression modeling showed that DNAme 
      contributed significantly and independently to explain phenotypic variability in 
      ankle dorsiflexor (3 CpGs: p = 0.001, 0.013, and 0.001), grip (p = 0.089), and 
      pinch (p = 0.028) strengths and in forced vital capacity (2 CpGs: p = 0.002 and 
      0.021) and maximal inspiratory pressure (p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to 
      the CTG repeat length, DMPK epivariations independently explain phenotypic 
      variability in DM1 and could thus improve prognostic accuracy for patients.

TI  - Robust Preimplantation Genetic Testing Strategy for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 by

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by expansion of the DMPK CTG 
      trinucleotide repeat. Disease transmission to offspring can be avoided through 
      prenatal diagnosis or preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders 
      (PGT-M). We describe a robust strategy for DM1 PGT-M that can be applied to 
      virtually any at-risk couple. This strategy utilizes whole-genome amplification, 
      followed by triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) detection of expanded DMPK alleles, in 
      parallel with single-tube haplotype analysis of 12 closely linked and highly 
      polymorphic microsatellite markers. Bidirectional TP-PCR and dodecaplex marker 
      PCR assays were optimized and validated on whole-genome amplified single 
      lymphoblasts isolated from DM1 reference cell lines, and tested on a simulated 
      PGT-M case comprising a parent-offspring trio and three simulated embryos. 
      Bidirectional DMPK TP-PCR reliably detects repeat expansions even in the presence 
      of non-CTG interruptions at either end of the expanded allele. Misdiagnoses, 
      diagnostic ambiguity, and couple-specific assay customization are further 
      minimized by the use of multi-marker haplotyping, preventing the loss of 
      potentially unaffected embryos for transfer.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by a CTG repeat expansion located in 
      the 3' UTR of the DMPK gene. Expanded DMPK transcripts aggregate into nuclear 
      foci and alter the function of RNA-binding proteins, leading to defects in the 
      alternative splicing of numerous pre-mRNAs. To date, there is no curative 
      treatment for DM1. Here we investigated a gene-editing strategy using the 
      CRISPR-Cas9 system from Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) to delete the CTG repeats in 
      the human DMPK locus. Co-expression of SaCas9 and selected pairs of single-guide 
      RNAs (sgRNAs) in cultured DM1 patient-derived muscle line cells carrying 2,600 
      CTG repeats resulted in targeted DNA deletion, ribonucleoprotein foci 
      disappearance, and correction of splicing abnormalities in various transcripts. 
      Furthermore, a single intramuscular injection of recombinant AAV vectors 
      expressing CRISPR-SaCas9 components in the tibialis anterior muscle of DMSXL 
      (myotonic dystrophy mouse line carrying the human DMPK gene with >1,000 CTG 
      repeats) mice decreased the number of pathological RNA foci in myonuclei. These 
      results establish the proof of concept that genome editing of a large 
      trinucleotide expansion is feasible in muscle and may represent a useful strategy 
      to be further developed for the treatment of myotonic dystrophy.

TI  - A Phenotypic Description of Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy using PhenoStacks.
PG  - 341-347
LID - 10.3233/JND-180345 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy (CDM1) is a rare neuromuscular 
      condition caused by a triplet repeat expansion in the DMPK gene. Despite there 
      being a well-recognized clinical syndrome, there has not been an effort to use a 
      standardized ontology system to describe the disease characteristics in existing 
      literature. Thus, comparing or contrasting different cohorts from the literature 
      can be challenging, and coding disease features for clinical research or for 
      registry data items is not uniform. PhenoStacks is a visualization analytics tool 
      which helps graphically illustrate phenotypes of patients with genetic disorders 
      using Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms and can sort phenotypes by different 
      disease characteristics. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the efficacy of PhenoStacks 
      and the HPO system as clinical research tools when describing CDM1 cohorts. 
      METHODS: Health Endpoints and Longitudinal progression in congenital myotonic 
      dystrophy (HELP-CDM) is an ongoing study which longitudinally follows patients 
      with CDM1. Items from the HELP-CDM data sheet were matched to corresponding HPO 
      terms and analyzed using PhenoStacks. RESULTS: In total 40 subjects' phenotypes 
      were visualized through PhenoStacks and 73 HPO terms were used for the analysis. 
      Frequent phenotypic features included "high narrow palate", "facial palsy", 
      "ptosis", "hyporeflexia", and "weak voice". Contractures were associated with 
      higher repeat sizes. Hypoplastic muscles and infantile axial hypotonia were more 
      frequently observed in infants. CONCLUSIONS: PhenoStacks is a valuable clinical 
      and scientific tool as it identifies variability within cohorts and highlights 
      significant phenotypic features.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder 
      caused by expansion of a germline and somatically unstable CTG repeat in the DMPK 
      gene. Previously, CTG repeat length at birth has been correlated to patient age 
      at symptom onset. Attempts to correlate CTG repeat length with progressive DM1 
      phenotypes, such as muscle power, have proven difficult. To better correlate 
      genotype with progressive phenotypes, we have measured CTG repeat tract length 
      and screened for interrupting variant repeats in 192 study participants from a 
      well-characterized Canadian cohort. We have assessed genotype-phenotype 
      correlations with nine progressive measures of skeletal muscle power and 
      respiratory function. We have built statistical models that include confounding 
      factors such as sex, age, height and weight to further explain variation in 
      muscle power. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between DM1 genotype and 
      respiratory function and skeletal muscle power, as part of a complex model that 
      includes additional modulators such as sex, age, height, weight and the presence 
      or absence of interrupting variant repeats. Distal skeletal muscle measurements, 
      such as hand pinch and grip strength, show the strongest correlation with disease 
      genotype. Detailed analysis of CTG repeat length, and incorporation of 
      confounding factors, greatly improves the predictive ability of these models. 
      They reveal a greater genetic influence on individual progressive phenotypes than 
      on age at symptom onset and for clinical trials will help optimize stratification 
      and explain patient variability. They will also help practitioners prioritize 
      assessment of the muscular power measurements that correlate best with disease 
      severity.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is a multisystem disorder caused by the expansion of a 
      trinucleotide repeat in the DMPK gene. In this study we evaluated the performance 
      of the FastDM1(TM) DMPK sizing kit in myotonic dystrophy type 1 testing. This 
      commercially available triplet repeat-primed PCR based kit was validated using 
      reference and clinical samples. Based on testing with 19 reference samples, the 
      assay yielded repeat sizes within three repeats from the consensus reference 
      length, demonstrating an accuracy of 100%. Additionally, the assay generated 
      consistent repeat size information with a concentration range of template-DNA, 
      and upon repetition and reproduction (CV 0.36% to 0.41%). Clinical performance 
      was established with 235 archived prenatal and postnatal clinical samples, 
      yielding results of 100% sensitivity (95% CI, 97.29% to 100%) and 100% 
      specificity (95% CI, 96.19% to 100%) in classifying the samples into the 
      respective genotype groups of 5-35 (normal), 36-50 (non-pathogenic 
      pre-expansion), 51-150 (unstable intermediate-sized pathogenic) or >150 (unstable 
      pathogenic) CTG repeats, respectively. Furthermore, the assay identified 
      interrupted repeat expansions in all samples known to have interruptions, and 
      also identified interruptions in a subset of the clinical samples.

AB  - RATIONALE: Myotonic dystrophy is a progressive multisystem genetic heterogeneous 
      disorder. General anesthesia with opioids increases the risk of prolonged 
      postanesthetic respiratory recovery in myotonic dystrophy patients. PATIENT 
      CONCERNS: A 20-year-old previously healthy woman was transferred to our emergency 
      department for further workup of respiratory failure, and massive ascites with 
      abscess caused by endometriosis. Hypercapnic respiratory failure persisted under 
      intensive care unit (ICU) management, but finally improved after cessation of 
      fentanyl as a sedative agent. DIAGNOSIS: Myotonic dystrophy type 1. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Massive ascites with abscess was accordingly managed by drainage, 
      antibiotics, and an antifungal agent. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 was confirmed 
      after molecular genetic testing revealed a cytosine-thymine-guanine repeat length 
      of 400 to 450 in the DMPK gene. OUTCOMES: The patient was discharged without 
      complications on hospital day 69. LESSONS: Myotonic dystrophy should be 
      considered when hypercapnic respiratory failure persists in sedated ICU patients. 
      Opioids should not be used for perioperative management of patients with myotonic 
      dystrophy.

LID - 10.1007/s10072-019-03783-w [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by CTG nucleotide repeat expansions in 
      the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase 
      (DMPK) gene. The expanded CTG repeats encode toxic CUG RNAs that cause disease, 
      largely through RNA gain-of-function. DM1 is a fatal disease characterized by 
      progressive muscle wasting, which has no cure. Regenerative medicine has emerged 
      as a promising therapeutic modality for DM1, especially with the advancement of 
      induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell technology and therapeutic genome editing. 
      However, there is an unmet need to identify in vitro outcome measures to 
      demonstrate the therapeutic effects prior to in vivo clinical trials. In this 
      study, we examined the muscle regeneration (myotube formation) in normal and DM1 
      myoblasts in vitro to establish outcome measures for therapeutic monitoring. We 
      found normal proliferation of DM1 myoblasts, but abnormal nuclear aggregation 
      during the early stage myotube formation, as well as myotube degeneration during 
      the late stage of myotube formation. We concluded that early abnormal nuclear 
      aggregation and late myotube degeneration offer easy and sensitive outcome 
      measures to monitor therapeutic effects in vitro.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a complex neuromuscular disorder caused by 
      expansion of a CTG repeat in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the DMPK gene. 
      Mutant DMPK transcripts form aberrant structures and anomalously associate with 
      RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). As a first step toward better understanding of the 
      involvement of abnormal DMPK mRNA folding in DM1 manifestation, we used SHAPE, 
      DMS, CMCT, and RNase T1 structure probing in vitro for modeling of the topology 
      of the DMPK 3'-UTR with normal and pathogenic repeat lengths of up to 197 CUG 
      triplets. The resulting structural information was validated by disruption of 
      base-pairing with LNA antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) and used for prediction 
      of therapeutic AON accessibility and verification of DMPK knockdown efficacy in 
      cells. Our model for DMPK RNA structure demonstrates that the hairpin formed by 
      the CUG repeat has length-dependent conformational plasticity, with a structure 
      that is guided by and embedded in an otherwise rigid architecture of flanking 
      regions in the DMPK 3'-UTR. Evidence is provided that long CUG repeats may form 
      not only single asymmetrical hairpins but also exist as branched structures. 
      These newly identified structures have implications for DM1 pathogenic 
      mechanisms, like sequestration of RBPs and repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) 
      translation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Transthyretin (TTR)-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is 
      an autosomal dominant neurological disease, caused most frequently by a Val30Met 
      (now classified as Val50Met) substitution in TTR. Age at onset (AO) ranges from 
      19 to 82 years, and variability exists mostly between generations. Unstable 
      oligonucleotide repeats in various genes are the mechanism behind several 
      neurological diseases, found also to act as modifiers for other disorders. Our 
      aim was to investigate whether large normal repeat alleles of 10 genes had a 
      possible modifier effect in AO in Portuguese TTR-FAP Val30Met families. METHODS: 
      We analyzed 329 Portuguese patients from 123 families. Repeat length (at ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, TBP, ATN1, HTT, JPH3, AR, and DMPK) was assessed by single 
      and multiplex polymerase chain reaction, using fluorescently labeled primers, 
      followed by capillary electrophoresis. We used a family-centered approach, and 
      generalized estimating equations were used to account for AO correlation between 
      family members. RESULTS: For ATXN2, the presence of at least 1 allele longer than 
      22 CAGs was significantly associated with an earlier onset in TTR-FAP Val30Met, 
      decreasing mean AO by 6 years (95% confidence interval = -8.81 to -2.19, p = 
      0.001). No association was found for the remaining repeat loci. INTERPRETATION: 
      Length of normal repeats at ATXN2 may modify AO in TTR-FAP Val30Met and may 
      function as a risk factor. This can be due to the role of ATXN2 in RNA metabolism 
      and as a modulator of various cellular processes, including mitochondrial stress. 
      This may have relevant implications for prognosis and the follow-up of 
      presymptomatic carriers. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:251-258.

AB  - CTG expansions in DMPK gene, causing myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), are 
      characterized by pronounced somatic instability. A large proportion of 
      variability of somatic instability is explained by expansion size and patient's 
      age at sampling, while individual-specific differences are attributed to 
      additional factors. The age at onset is extremely variable in DM1, and inversely 
      correlates with the expansion size and individual-specific differences in somatic 
      instability. Three to five percent of DM1 patients carry repeat interruptions and 
      some appear with later age at onset than expected for corresponding expansion 
      size. Herein, we characterized somatic instability of interrupted DMPK expansions 
      and the effect on age at onset in our previously described patients. 
      Repeat-primed PCR showed stable structures of different types and patterns of 
      repeat interruptions in blood cells over time and buccal cells. Single-molecule 
      small-pool PCR quantification of somatic instability and mathematical modeling 
      showed that interrupted expansions were characterized by lower level of somatic 
      instability accompanied by slower progression over time. Mathematical modeling 
      demonstrated that individual-specific differences in somatic instability had 
      greater influence on age at onset in patients with interrupted expansions. 
      Therefore, repeat interruptions have clinical importance for disease course in 
      DM1 patients due to stabilizing effect on DMPK expansions in somatic cells.

LID - 1532
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystemic disorder with predominant 
      myotonia and muscular dystrophy which is caused by CTG-repeat expansions in the 
      DMPK gene. These repeat expansions are transcribed and the resulting mRNA 
      accumulates RNA-binding proteins involved in splicing, resulting in a general 
      splicing defect. We observed nuclear envelope (NE) alterations in DM1 primary 
      myoblasts. These included invaginations of the NE as well as an altered 
      composition of the nuclear lamina. Specifically, we investigated NE transmembrane 
      proteins (NETs) in DM1 primary myoblasts, staining to determine if their 
      distribution was altered compared to controls and if this could contribute to 
      these structural defects. We also tested the expression of these NETs in muscle 
      and how localization changes in the DM1 primary myoblasts undergoing 
      differentiation in vitro to myotubes. We found no changes in the localization of 
      the tested NETs, but most tended to exhibit reduced expression with increasing 
      DMPK-repeat length. Nonetheless, the DM1 patient expression range was within the 
      expression range of the controls. Additionally, we found a down-regulation of the 
      possible nesprin 1 giant isoform in DM1 primary myoblasts which could contribute 
      to the increased NE invaginations. Thus, nesprin 1 may be an interesting target 
      for further investigation in DM1 disease pathology.

AB  - PURPOSE: Myotonic dystrophy, also known as dystrophia myotonica (DM), is an 
      autosomal dominant disorder with 2 genetically distinct forms. DM type 1 (DM1) is 
      the more common form and is caused by abnormal expansion of 
      cytosine/thymine/guanine (CTG) repeats in the DM protein kinase (DMPK ) gene. Our 
      study aimed to determine whether the age of onset is correlated with CTG repeat 
      length in a population of pediatric patients with DM1. METHODS: We 
      retrospectively identified 30 pediatric patients with DM1 that underwent DMPK 
      testing, of which the clinical data of 17 was sufficient. The cohort was divided 
      into 2 subgroups based on the clinical phenotype (congenital-onset vs. 
      late-onset) and number of CTG repeats (<1,000 vs. >/=1,000). RESULTS: We found no 
      significant difference between the age of onset and CTG repeat length in our 
      pediatric patient population. Based on clinical subgrouping, we found that the 
      congenital-onset subgroup was statistically different with respect to several 
      variables, including prematurity, rate of admission to neonatal intensive care 
      unit, need for respiratory support at birth, hypotonia, dysphagia, ventilator 
      dependence, and functional status on last visit, compared to the late-onset 
      subgroup. Based on genetic subgrouping, we found a single variable (poor feeding 
      in neonate) that was significantly different in the large CTG subgroup than that 
      in the small CTG subgroup. CONCLUSION: Clinical variables exhibiting 
      statistically significant differences between the subgroups should be focused on 
      prognosis and designing tailored management approaches for the patients; our 
      findings will contribute to achieve this important goal for treating patients 
      with DM1.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by a CTG repeat expansion close to the DMPK gene. The fibroblasts 
      from a patient with DM1 were successfully converted to induced pluripotent stem 
      cells (iPSCs), designated ZZUi006-A, by employing episomal plasmids expressing 
      OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, LIN28, L-MYC. The ZZUi006-A cell line may provide a robust

AB  - Myotonic dystrophies (DM) are slowly progressing multisystemic disorders caused 
      by repeat expansions in the DMPK or CNBP genes. The multisystemic involvement in 
      DM patients often reflects the appearance of accelerated aging. This is partly 
      due to visible features such as cataracts, muscle weakness, and frontal baldness, 
      but there are also less obvious features like cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes or 
      hypogammaglobulinemia. These aging features suggest the hypothesis that DM could 
      be a segmental progeroid disease. To identify the molecular cause of this 
      characteristic appearance of accelerated aging we compare clinical features of DM 
      to "typical" segmental progeroid disorders caused by mutations in DNA repair or 
      nuclear envelope proteins. Furthermore, we characterize if this premature aging 
      effect is also reflected on the cellular level in DM and investigate overlaps 
      with "classical" progeroid disorders. To investigate the molecular similarities 
      at the cellular level we use primary DM and control cell lines. This analysis 
      reveals many similarities to progeroid syndromes linked to the nuclear envelope. 
      Our comparison on both clinical and molecular levels argues for qualification of 
      DM as a segmental progeroid disorder.

TI  - De novo repeat interruptions are associated with reduced somatic instability and 
      mild or absent clinical features in myotonic dystrophy type 1.
PG  - 1635-1647
LID - 10.1038/s41431-018-0156-9 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystem disorder, caused by expansion of 
      a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3'-untranslated region of the DMPK gene. The 
      repeat expansion is somatically unstable and tends to increase in length with 
      time, contributing to disease progression. In some individuals, the repeat array 
      is interrupted by variant repeats such as CCG and CGG, stabilising the expansion 
      and often leading to milder symptoms. We have characterised three families, each 
      including one person with variant repeats that had arisen de novo on paternal 
      transmission of the repeat expansion. Two individuals were identified for 
      screening due to an unusual result in the laboratory diagnostic test, and the 
      third due to exceptionally mild symptoms. The presence of variant repeats in all 
      three expanded alleles was confirmed by restriction digestion of small pool PCR 
      products, and allele structures were determined by PacBio sequencing. Each was 
      different, but all contained CCG repeats close to the 3'-end of the repeat 
      expansion. All other family members had inherited pure CTG repeats. The variant 
      repeat-containing alleles were more stable in the blood than pure alleles of 
      similar length, which may in part account for the mild symptoms observed in all 
      three individuals. This emphasises the importance of somatic instability as a 
      disease mechanism in DM1. Further, since patients with variant repeats may have 
      unusually mild symptoms, identification of these individuals has important 
      implications for genetic counselling and for patient stratification in DM1 
      clinical trials.

TI  - Efficient CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of trinucleotide repeat expansion in 
      myotonic dystrophy patient-derived iPS and myogenic cells.
PG  - 8275-8298
LID - 10.1093/nar/gky548 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 is an attractive platform to potentially correct dominant genetic 
      diseases by gene editing with unprecedented precision. In the current 
      proof-of-principle study, we explored the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene-editing in 
      myotonic dystrophy type-1 (DM1), an autosomal-dominant muscle disorder, by 
      excising the CTG-repeat expansion in the 3'-untranslated-region (UTR) of the 
      human myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene in DM1 patient-specific 
      induced pluripotent stem cells (DM1-iPSC), DM1-iPSC-derived myogenic cells and 
      DM1 patient-specific myoblasts. To eliminate the pathogenic gain-of-function 
      mutant DMPK transcript, we designed a dual guide RNA based strategy that excises 
      the CTG-repeat expansion with high efficiency, as confirmed by Southern blot and 
      single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing. Correction efficiencies up to 90% 
      could be attained in DM1-iPSC as confirmed at the clonal level, following 
      ribonucleoprotein (RNP) transfection of CRISPR/Cas9 components without the need 
      for selective enrichment. Expanded CTG repeat excision resulted in the 
      disappearance of ribonuclear foci, a quintessential cellular phenotype of DM1, in 
      the corrected DM1-iPSC, DM1-iPSC-derived myogenic cells and DM1 myoblasts. 
      Consequently, the normal intracellular localization of the muscleblind-like 
      splicing regulator 1 (MBNL1) was restored, resulting in the normalization of 
      splicing pattern of SERCA1. This study validates the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene 
      editing of repeat expansions.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a dominantly inherited neuromuscular disorder caused 
      by expression of mutant myotonin-protein kinase (DMPK) transcripts containing 
      expanded CUG repeats. Pathogenic DMPK RNA sequesters the muscleblind-like (MBNL) 
      proteins, causing alterations in metabolism of various RNAs. Cardiac dysfunction 
      represents the second most common cause of death in DM type 1 (DM1) patients. 
      However, the contribution of MBNL sequestration in DM1 cardiac dysfunction is 
      unclear. We overexpressed Muscleblind (Mbl), the DrosophilaMBNL orthologue, in 
      cardiomyocytes of DM1 model flies and observed a rescue of heart dysfunctions, 
      which are characteristic of these model flies and resemble cardiac defects 
      observed in patients. We also identified a drug - daunorubicin hydrochloride - 
      that directly binds to CUG repeats and alleviates Mbl sequestration in Drosophila 
      DM1 cardiomyocytes, resulting in mis-splicing rescue and cardiac function 
      recovery. These results demonstrate the relevance of Mbl sequestration caused by 
      expanded-CUG-repeat RNA in cardiac dysfunctions in DM1, and highlight the 
      potential of strategies aimed at inhibiting this protein-RNA interaction to 
      recover normal cardiac function.

AB  - Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystemic disease, autosomal dominant, 
      caused by a CTG repeat expansion in DMPK gene. We assessed the appropriateness of 
      patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) as a 
      model to recapitulate some aspects of the pathogenetic mechanism involving 
      cardiac manifestations in DM1 patients. Once obtained in vitro, CMs have been 
      characterized for their morphology and their functionality. CMs DM1 show 
      intranuclear foci and transcript markers abnormally spliced respect to WT ones, 
      as well as several irregularities in nuclear morphology, probably caused by an 
      unbalanced lamin A/C ratio. Electrophysiological characterization evidences an 
      abnormal profile only in CMs DM1 such that the administration of antiarrythmic 
      drugs to these cells highlights even more the functional defect linked to the 
      disease. Finally, Atomic Force Measurements reveal differences in the 
      biomechanical behaviour of CMs DM1, in terms of frequencies and synchronicity of 
      the beats. Altogether the complex phenotype described in this work, strongly 
      reproduces some aspects of the human DM1 cardiac phenotype. Therefore, the 
      present study provides an in vitro model suggesting novel insights into the 
      mechanisms leading to the development of arrhythmogenesis and dilatative 
      cardiomyopathy to consider when approaching to DM1 patients, especially for the 
      risk assessment of sudden cardiac death (SCD). These data could be also useful in 
      identifying novel biomarkers effective in clinical settings and patient-tailored 
      therapies.

TI  - Macroscopic and microscopic diversity of missplicing in the central nervous 
      system of patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1.
PG  - 235-240
LID - 10.1097/WNR.0000000000000968 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) is a multiorgan disease caused by CTG-repeat 
      expansion in the DMPK gene. Sequestration of the splicing factor MBNL1 results in 
      aberrant splicing in many genes in DM1 skeletal muscle, whereas MBNL2 plays a 
      leading role in missplicing in the central nervous system (CNS) of patients with 
      DM1. Splicing misregulation of most MBNL2-regulated genes occurs in the temporal 
      cortex but not in the cerebellum of autopsied patients with DM1. To understand 
      the diversity at macroscopic and microscopic levels in CNS of patients with DM1. 
      Using autopsied brain tissues, we examined alternative splicing ratios of 
      MBNL2-regulated genes and expression levels of potential splicing factors. We 
      found differences in splicing abnormalities among tested regions of the CNS from 
      patients with DM1. In the frontal and temporal cortices and the hippocampus, many 
      genes were aberrantly spliced, but severity differed among the brain regions. By 
      contrast, there were no significant differences in the ratio of splicing variants 
      for most of the genes in the cerebellar cortex and spinal cord between DM1 and 
      control samples. We failed to find any change in the amount of potential factors 
      (MBNL and CUGBP proteins and DMPK mRNA) which explain the modest missplicing in 
      the cerebellum. LASER capture microdissection demonstrated splicing misregulation 
      in the molecular layer of the cerebellum but not in the granular layer. This is 
      the first study to reveal missplicing in a functional cell layer of DM1 and to 
      compare splicing misregulation in a wide region of the CNS using statistical 
      analysis.

TI  - Design of a "Mini" Nucleic Acid Probe for Cooperative Binding of an RNA-Repeated 
      Transcript Associated with Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1.

LID - 10.1021/acs.biochem.7b01239 [doi]
AB  - Toxic RNAs containing expanded trinucleotide repeats are the cause of many 
      neuromuscular disorders, one being myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). DM1 is 
      triggered by CTG-repeat expansion in the 3'-untranslated region of the DMPK gene, 
      resulting in a toxic gain of RNA function through sequestration of MBNL1 protein, 
      among others. Herein, we report the development of a relatively short miniPEG-gamma 
      peptide nucleic acid probe, two triplet repeats in length, containing terminal 
      pyrene moieties, that is capable of binding rCUG repeats in a sequence-specific 
      and selective manner. The newly designed probe can discriminate the pathogenic 
      rCUG(exp) from the wild-type transcript and disrupt the rCUG(exp)-MBNL1 complex. 
      The work provides a proof of concept for the development of relatively short 
      nucleic acid probes for targeting RNA-repeat expansions associated with DM1 and 
      other related neuromuscular disorders.

      generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using the Sendai virus expressing 
      KLF4, OCT4, SOX2 and C-MYC. The resulting iPSCs were EBV free, expressed the 
      pluripotency markers, could be differentiated into the three germ layers in 
      vitro, had a normal karyotype, and retained the genetic DM1 mutation. This iPSC 
      line could be useful for the investigation of DM1 mechanisms.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is the most common adult-onset muscular 
      dystrophy, characterized by progressive myopathy, myotonia, and multi-organ 
      involvement. This dystrophy is an inherited autosomal dominant disease caused by 
      a (CTG)n expansion within the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. Expression 
      of the mutated gene results in production of toxic transcripts that aggregate as 
      nuclear foci and sequester RNA-binding proteins, resulting in mis-splicing of 
      several transcripts, defective translation, and microRNA dysregulation. No 
      effective therapy is yet available for treatment of the disease. In this study, 
      myogenic cell models were generated from myotonic dystrophy patient-derived 
      fibroblasts. These cells exhibit typical disease-associated ribonuclear 
      aggregates, containing CUG repeats and muscleblind-like 1 protein, and 
      alternative splicing alterations. We exploited these cell models to develop new 
      gene therapy strategies aimed at eliminating the toxic mutant repeats. Using the 
      CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system, the repeat expansions were removed, therefore 
      preventing nuclear foci formation and splicing alterations. Compared with the 
      previously reported strategies of inhibition/degradation of CUG expanded 
      transcripts by various techniques, the advantage of this approach is that 
      affected cells can be permanently reverted to a normal phenotype.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an inherited multisystem neuromuscular 
      disorder caused by a CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the DMPK gene. Recent 
      evidence documents that DM1 patients have an increased risk of certain cancers, 
      but whether skin cancer risks are elevated is unclear. Using the U.K. Clinical 
      Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), we identified 1,061 DM1 patients and 15,119 
      DM1-free individuals matched on gender, birth year (+/-2 years), attending practice 
      and registration year (+/-1 year). We calculated the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
      confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of DM1 diagnosis with skin cancer 
      risk using Cox proportional hazards models, for all skin cancers combined and by 
      histological subtype. Follow-up started at the latest of the age at practice 
      registration, DM1 diagnosis/control selection or January 1st 1988, and ended at 
      the earliest of the age at first skin cancer diagnosis, death, transfer out of 
      the practice, last date of data collection or the end of the CPRD record (October 
      31, 2016). During a median follow-up of 3.6 years, 35 DM1 patients and 108 
      matched DM1-free individuals developed a skin cancer. DM1 patients had an 
      increased risk of skin cancer overall (HR = 5.44, 95% CI = 3.33-8.89, 
      p < 0.0001), and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) (HR = 5.78, 95% CI = 3.36-9.92, 
      p < 0.0001). Risks did not differ by gender, or age at DM1 diagnosis 
      (p-heterogeneity > 0.5). Our data confirm suggested associations between DM1 and 
      skin neoplasms with the highest risk seen for BCC. Patients are advised to 
      minimize ultraviolet light exposure and seek medical advice for suspicious 
      lesions.

      patients carrying variant repeats within DMPK expansions.
PG  - 207-218
LID - 10.1007/s10048-017-0523-7 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by a highly unstable expansion of CTG 
      repeats in the DMPK gene. Its huge phenotypic variability cannot be explained 
      solely by the repeat number. Recently, variant repeats within the DMPK expansions 
      have emerged as potential disease modifiers. The frequency of variant expanded 
      alleles was estimated in 242 DM1 patients from 174 Serbian families using 
      repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). The patterns of variant repeats were determined by 
      direct sequencing of RP-PCR or PCR products. PCR-based southern blot was 
      performed to get insight into the intergenerational mutational dynamics of 
      variant expanded alleles. All patients carrying variant repeats were clinically 
      re-examined. Variant repeats were observed in eight patients from five families 
      (2.9%). They were detected only at the 3' end of DMPK expansions. CCG variant 
      repeats were present in seven patients, either as a part of regular runs of 
      CCGCTG hexamer, individual repeats, or CCG blocks. Analyses of three 
      intergenerational transmissions revealed a considerable stability or likely a 
      contraction of variant expanded alleles. Intriguingly, a decrease in age at onset 
      accompanied these transmissions. Overall, patients were characterized by a milder 
      phenotype and/or some atypical symptoms that could be rather clinically 
      suggestive of myotonic dystrophy type 2. In addition, the first case of de novo 
      CTC variant repeat was observed. Variant repeats might explain a part of the 
      phenotypic variability in a small percent of DM1 patients and likely display a 
      stabilizing effect on the meiotic instability of DMPK expanded alleles.

TI  - Fuchs' Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy and RNA Foci in Patients With Myotonic 
      Dystrophy.
PG  - 4579-4585
LID - 10.1167/iovs.17-22350 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The most common cause of Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is 
      an intronic CTG repeat expansion in TCF4. Expanded CUG repeat RNA colocalize with 
      splicing factor, muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1), in nuclear foci in endothelium as a 
      molecular hallmark. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a neuromuscular disorder 
      caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of DMPK. In 
      this study, we examine for RNA-MBNL1 foci in endothelial cells of FECD subjects 
      with DM1, test the hypothesis that DM1 patients are at risk for FECD, and 
      determine prevalence of TCF4 and DMPK expansions in a FECD cohort. METHODS: Using 
      FISH, we examined for nuclear RNA-MBNL1 foci in endothelial cells from FECD 
      subjects with DM1. We examined 13 consecutive unrelated DM1 patients for FECD 
      using slit-lamp and specular microscopy. We genotyped TCF4 and DMPK repeat 
      polymorphisms in a FECD cohort of 317 probands using short-tandem repeat and 
      triplet repeat-primed PCR assays. RESULTS: We detected abundant nuclear RNA foci 
      colocalizing with MBNL1 in endothelial cells of FECD subjects with DM1. Six of 
      thirteen DM1 patients (46%) had slit-lamp and specular microscopic findings of 
      FECD, compared to 4% disease prevalence (P = 5.5 x 10-6). As expected, 222 out of 
      317 (70%) FECD probands harbored TCF4 expansion, while one subject harbored DMPK 
      expansion without prior diagnosis of DM1. CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that DM1 
      patients are at risk for FECD. DMPK mutations contribute to the genetic burden of 
      FECD but are uncommon. We establish a connection between two repeat expansion 
      disorders converging upon RNA-MBNL1 foci and FECD.

TI  - Dystrophia myotonica type 1 presenting with dysarthria: A case report and 
      literature review.
PG  - 1104-1108
LID - 10.3892/etm.2017.4579 [doi]
AB  - Dystrophia myotonica (DM) type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder, caused by a 
      trinucleotide CTG repeat expansion in the 3' untranslated region of the 
      dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene (chromosome 19q13.3). The 
      disorder affects different organ systems, including the skeletal muscles, ocular 
      lens, lungs, heart and gastrointestinal tract, as well as the endocrine and 
      central nervous systems. The skeletal muscles are most frequently involved, 
      whereby the disorder manifests as myotonia, muscle weakness and amyotrophy. 
      However, DM type 1 presenting with dysarthria is rare. The current study presents 
      a case of a 28-year-old male with DM type 1 presenting with dysarthria and 
      associated multifocal hyperintense lesions in the white matter. Although 
      electromyogram measurements identified myotonic discharges in all extremities, a 
      muscle biopsy failed to detect the characteristic pathological features of DM 
      type 1. A lack of a positive family history for DM type 1 also obscured 
      diagnosis. However, genetic analysis detected a single allele in the P12 segment 
      of the DMPK gene that included a CTG expansion of 13 repeats and a three-base 
      gradient fragment in the P134 segment that included a CTG expansion of >600 
      repeats. According to the characteristics of dysarthria, multifocal hyperintense 
      lesions in the white matter, electromyogram measurement results and genetic 
      testing results, a diagnosis of DM type 1 was confirmed.

TI  - Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 Clinical, Electrophysiological and Molecular 
      Characterization: Experience at Tertiary Care Centre.
PG  - 32-37
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is the most common myotonic disorder. 
      Molecular genetic testing of the Dystrophia Myotonica-Protein Kinase DMPK gene to 
      detect expansion of CTG repeats is confirmatory. TP-PCR (Triplet 
      Primed-Polymerase Chain Reaction) is rapid and effective screening for the CTG 
      repeat expansions in myotonic dystrophy. Indian data regarding clinical and 
      genetic evaluation of DM1 are sparse. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a 
      prospective observational study at a tertiary neurology centre. It included 
      subjects having clinical and electrophysiological evidence of myotonia with CTG 
      repeat expansion of DMPK gene demonstrated by TP-PCR. Diagnostic molecular 
      assessment was done by two-step procedure; conventional PCR and Fragment length 
      analysis followed by TP-PCR. RESULTS: Seventeen patients fulfilled the inclusion 
      criteria. There were fifteen males and two females, with age ranging from 19 to 
      53 years (mean age 33years). In the phenotype, large calves were seen in three 
      patients and ophthalmoparesis and scapular winging were seen in one patient each. 
      Screening of patients by PCR-Fragment analysis identified all 17 cases to be of 
      DM1. Further confirmatory test by TP-PCR also successfully identified the cases 
      to be of DM1. TP-PCR technique using forward combination primers was used 
      successfully in detecting expansion of CTG repeats in 13 cases whereas in 
      remaining 4 cases reverse primer combination was used successfully. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This series establishes that a combination of PCR- Fragment analysis and TP-PCR 
      is simple and cost effective in determining the diagnosis of Myotonic dystrophy 
      type 1. This study also documents a new clinical observation of calf hypertrophy 
      in genetically confirmed patients with DM1.

TI  - (CCUG)(n) RNA toxicity in a Drosophila model of myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) 
      activates apoptosis.
PG  - 993-1003
LID - 10.1242/dmm.026179 [doi]
AB  - The myotonic dystrophies are prototypic toxic RNA gain-of-function diseases. 
      Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2) are caused by different 
      unstable, noncoding microsatellite repeat expansions - (CTG)(DM1) in DMPK and 
      (CCTG)(DM2) in CNBP Although transcription of mutant repeats into (CUG)(DM1) or 
      (CCUG)(DM2) appears to be necessary and sufficient to cause disease, their 
      pathomechanisms remain incompletely understood. To study the mechanisms of 
      (CCUG)(DM2) toxicity and develop a convenient model for drug screening, we 
      generated a transgenic DM2 model in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster with 
      (CCUG)(n) repeats of variable length (n=16 and 106). Expression of noncoding 
      (CCUG)(106), but not (CCUG)(16), in muscle and retinal cells led to the formation 
      of ribonuclear foci and mis-splicing of genes implicated in DM pathology. 
      Mis-splicing could be rescued by co-expression of human MBNL1, but not by CUGBP1 
      (CELF1) complementation. Flies with (CCUG)(106) displayed strong disruption of 
      external eye morphology and of the underlying retina. Furthermore, expression of 
      (CCUG)(106) in developing retinae caused a strong apoptotic response. Inhibition 
      of apoptosis rescued the retinal disruption in (CCUG)(106) flies. Finally, we 
      tested two chemical compounds that have shown therapeutic potential in DM1 
      models. Whereas treatment of (CCUG)(106) flies with pentamidine had no effect, 
      treatment with a PKR inhibitor blocked both the formation of RNA foci and 
      apoptosis in retinae of (CCUG)(106) flies. Our data indicate that expression of 
      expanded (CCUG)(DM2) repeats is toxic, causing inappropriate cell death in 
      affected fly eyes. Our Drosophila DM2 model might provide a convenient tool for 
      in vivo drug screening.

AB  - In yeast and higher eukaryotes nuclear retention of transcripts may serve in 
      control over RNA decay, nucleocytoplasmic transport and premature cytoplasmic 
      appearance of mRNAs. Hyperadenylation of RNA is known to be associated with 
      nuclear retention, but the cause-consequence relationship between 
      hyperadenylation and regulation of RNA nuclear export is still unclear. We 
      compared polyadenylation status between normal and expanded DMPK transcripts in 
      muscle cells and tissues derived from unaffected individuals and patients with 
      myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by 
      (CTG)n repeat expansion in the DMPK gene. DM1 etiology is characterized by an 
      almost complete block of nuclear export of DMPK transcripts carrying a long 
      (CUG)n repeat, including aberrant sequestration of RNA-binding proteins. We show 
      here by use of cell fractionation, RNA size separation and analysis of poly(A) 
      tail length that a considerable fraction of transcripts from the normal DMPK 
      allele is also retained in the nucleus (~30%). They carry poly(A) tails with an 
      unusually broad length distribution, ranging between a few dozen to >500 
      adenosine residues. Remarkably, expanded DMPK (CUG)n transcripts from the mutant 
      allele, almost exclusively nuclear, carry equally long poly(A) tails. Our 
      findings thus suggest that nuclear retention may be a common feature of 
      regulation of DMPK RNA expression. The typical forced nuclear residence of 
      expanded DMPK transcripts affects this regulation in tissues of DM1 patients, but 
      not through hyperadenylation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The lack of epidemiological data and molecular diagnostic services in 
      Malaysia has hampered the setting-up of a comprehensive management plan for 
      patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), leading to delayed diagnosis, 
      treatment and support for patients and families. The aim of this study was to 
      estimate the prevalence of DM1 in the 3 major ethnic groups in Malaysia and 
      evaluate the feasibility of a single tube triplet-primed PCR (TP-PCR) method for 
      diagnosis of DM1 in Malaysia. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We used PCR to 
      determine the size of CTG repeats in 377 individuals not known to be affected by 
      DM and 11 DM1 suspected patients, recruited from a tertiary hospital in Kuala 
      Lumpur. TP-PCR was performed on selected samples, followed by Southern blot 
      hybridisation of PCR amplified fragments to confirm and estimate the size of CTG 
      expansion. OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of individuals not known to be affected 
      by DM with (CTG)(>18) was determined according to ethnic group and as a whole 
      population. The chi(2) test was performed to compare the distribution of (CTG)(>18) 
      with 12 other populations. Additionally, the accuracy of TP-PCR in detecting CTG 
      expansion in 11 patients with DM1 was determined by comparing the results with 
      that from Southern blot hybridisation. RESULTS: Of the 754 chromosomes studied, 
      (CTG)(>18) frequency of 3.60%, 1.57% and 4.00% in the Malay, Chinese and Indian 
      subpopulations, respectively, was detected, showing similarities to data from 
      Thai, Taiwanese and Kuwaiti populations. We also successfully detected CTG 
      expansions in 9 patients using the TP-PCR method followed by the estimation of 
      CTG expansion size via Southern blot hybridisation. CONCLUSIONS: The results show 
      a low DM1 prevalence in Malaysia with the possibility of underdiagnosis and 
      demonstrates the feasibility of using a clinical and TP-PCR-based approach for 
      rapid and cost-effective DM1 diagnosis in developing countries.

      repeat instability.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal-dominant multi-system disease 
      caused by expanded CTG repeats in dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK). The 
      expanded CTG repeats are unstable and can increase the length of the gene with 
      age, which worsens the symptoms. In order to establish a human stem cell system 
      suitable for the investigation of repeat instability, DM1 patient-derived iPSCs 
      were generated and differentiated into three cell types commonly affected in DM1, 
      namely cardiomyocytes, neurons and myocytes. Then we precisely analysed the CTG 
      repeat lengths in these cells. Our DM1-iPSCs showed a gradual lengthening of CTG 
      repeats with unchanged repeat distribution in all cell lines depending on the 
      passage numbers of undifferentiated cells. However, the average CTG repeat length 
      did not change significantly after differentiation into different somatic cell 
      types. We also evaluated the chromatin accessibility in DM1-iPSCs using ATAC-seq. 
      The chromatin status in DM1 cardiomyocytes was closed at the DMPK locus as well 
      as at SIX5 and its promoter region, whereas it was open in control, suggesting 
      that the epigenetic modifications may be related to the CTG repeat expansion in 
      DM1. These findings may help clarify the role of repeat instability in the CTG 
      repeat expansion in DM1.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by (CTG...CAG)(n)-repeat expansion within 
      the DMPK gene and thought to be mediated by a toxic RNA gain of function. Current 
      attempts to develop therapy for this disease mainly aim at destroying or blocking 
      abnormal properties of mutant DMPK (CUG)n RNA. Here, we explored a DNA-directed 
      strategy and demonstrate that single clustered regularly interspaced short 
      palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9-cleavage in either its 5' or 3' unique flank 
      promotes uncontrollable deletion of large segments from the expanded 
      trinucleotide repeat, rather than formation of short indels usually seen after 
      double-strand break repair. Complete and precise excision of the repeat tract 
      from normal and large expanded DMPK alleles in myoblasts from unaffected 
      individuals, DM1 patients, and a DM1 mouse model could be achieved at high 
      frequency by dual CRISPR/Cas9-cleavage at either side of the (CTG...CAG)n sequence. 
      Importantly, removal of the repeat appeared to have no detrimental effects on the 
      expression of genes in the DM1 locus. Moreover, myogenic capacity, 
      nucleocytoplasmic distribution, and abnormal RNP-binding behavior of transcripts 
      from the edited DMPK gene were normalized. Dual sgRNA-guided excision of the 
      (CTG...CAG)n tract by CRISPR/Cas9 technology is applicable for developing isogenic 
      cell lines for research and may provide new therapeutic opportunities for 
      patients with DM1.

AB  - The unstable (CTG.CAG)n trinucleotide repeat in the myotonic dystrophy type 1 
      (DM1) locus is bidirectionally transcribed from genes with terminal overlap. By 
      transcription in the sense direction, the DMPK gene produces various 
      alternatively spliced mRNAs with a (CUG)n repeat in their 3' UTR. Expression in 
      opposite orientation reportedly yields (CAG)n-repeat containing RNA, but both 
      structure and biologic significance of this antisense gene (DM1-AS) are largely 
      unknown. Via a combinatorial approach of computational and experimental analyses 
      of RNA from unaffected individuals and DM1 patients we discovered that DM1-AS 
      spans >6 kb, contains alternative transcription start sites and uses alternative 
      polyadenylation sites up- and downstream of the (CAG)n repeat. Moreover, its 
      primary transcripts undergo alternative splicing, whereby the (CAG)n segment is 
      removed as part of an intron. Thus, in patients a mixture of DM1-AS RNAs with and 
      without expanded (CAG)n repeat are produced. DM1-AS expression appears 
      upregulated in patients, but transcript abundance remains very low in all tissues 
      analyzed. Our data suggest that DM1-AS transcripts belong to the class of long 
      non-coding RNAs. These and other biologically relevant implications for how 
      (CAG)n-expanded transcripts may contribute to DM1 pathology can now be explored 
      experimentally.

TI  - Developmental Milestones and Quality of Life Assessment in a Congenital Myotonic 
      Dystrophy Cohort.
PG  - 405-412
AB  - BACKGROUND: Congenital myotonic dystrophy (CDM) is a neuromuscular disorder 
      caused by a CTG triplet repeat expansion in the DMPK gene. In addition to the 
      expected motor delay, affected children often have significant developmental 
      disability in language and cognitive realms, which ultimately impacts on quality 
      of life. OBJECTIVE: In a prospective cohort of children with CDM to 1) present 
      the profile of language and motor developmental milestones, and 2) describe their 
      early childhood health related quality of life (HRQOL). METHODS: A five year 
      cohort study of eligible incident cases of CDM was performed via the Canadian 
      Pediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP). Consenting subjects were then followed 
      from infancy in a prospective cohort study. Caregivers were contacted every 3 
      months for the first year of life, and then twice yearly in order to obtain data 
      concerning language skills, motor development and parent proxy HRQOL from the 
      PedsQL and Infant and Toddler Quality of life (ITQOL) questionnaires. RESULTS: 
      Milestones were achieved at later ages in patients when compared to healthy 
      children. Girls appeared to be more delayed than boys in both language and motor 
      skills. HRQOL scores remained stable in this cohort, for both the PedsQL and 
      ITQOL. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding developmental milestones and quality of life 
      are important parameters when judging a child's overall health. For CDM patients 
      delineating developmental milestones and QOL have important clinical care and 
      research implications.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy types 1 (DM1) and 2 (DM2) are autosomal dominant, 
      microsatellite repeat expansion disorders that affect muscle function. Myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1 is caused by CTG repeat expansion in the 3' UTR region of the 
      DMPK gene. Patients with DM2 have expansion of CCTG repeats in intron 1 of the 
      CNBP gene. In this unit, we review and discuss the clinical phenotypes, genetic 
      mutations causing the diseases, and the molecular diagnostic approaches and tools 
      that are used to determine repeat sizes in DM1/2. In summary, the goal of this 
      chapter is to provide the reader with a basic understanding of the clinical, 
      genetic and diagnostic aspects of these disorders. (c) 2016 by John Wiley & Sons,

TI  - Expanded DMPK repeats in dizygotic twins referred for diagnosis of autism versus 
      absence of expanded DMPK repeats at screening of 330 children with autism.
PG  - 2367-2372
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) belongs to the broad spectrum of genetic 
      disorders associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). ASD were reported 
      predominantly in congenital and early childhood forms of DM1. We describe 
      dizygotic twin boys with ASD who were referred for routine laboratory genetic 
      testing and in whom karyotyping, FMR1 gene testing, and single nucleotide 
      polymorphism array analysis yielded negative results. The father of the boys was 
      later diagnosed with suspected DM1, and testing revealed characteristic DMPK gene 
      expansions in his genome as well as in the genomes of both twins and their elder 
      brother, who also suffered from ASD. In accord with previous reports on childhood 
      forms of DM1, our patients showed prominent neuropsychiatric phenotypes 
      characterized especially by hypotonia, developmental and language delay, 
      emotional and affective lability, lowered adaptability, and social withdrawal. 
      The experience with this family and multiple literature reports of ASD in DM1 on 
      the one side but the lack of literature data on the frequency of DMPK gene 
      expansions in ASD patients on the other side prompted us to screen the DMPK gene 
      in a sample of 330 patients with ASD who were first seen by a geneticist before 
      they were 10 years of age, before the muscular weakness, which may signal DM1, 
      usually becomes obvious. The absence of any DMPK gene expansions in this cohort 
      indicates that targeted DMPK gene testing can be recommended only in ASD patients 
      with specific symptoms or family history suggestive of DM1.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK 
      gene in chromosome 19q13.3. External ophthalmoplegia is a rare manifestation in 
      DM1. We report a DM1 patient confirmed by the presence of 650 CTG triplet 
      expansions in the DMPK gene and had limitation of adduction gaze bilaterally. 
      Brain MRI showed bilateral medial rectus muscles atrophy. Our patient provides 
      additional evidence of ocular motor muscle involvement in DM1.

TI  - A Potent Inhibitor of Protein Sequestration by Expanded Triplet (CUG) Repeats 
      that Shows Phenotypic Improvements in a Drosophila Model of Myotonic Dystrophy.
PG  - 1428-35
LID - 10.1002/cmdc.201600081 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy is the most common form of adult-onset muscular dystrophy, 
      originating in a CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene. The expanded CUG 
      transcript sequesters MBNL1, a key regulator of alternative splicing, leading to 
      the misregulation of numerous pre-mRNAs. We report an RNA-targeted agent as a 
      possible lead compound for the treatment of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) that 
      reveals both the promise and challenges for this type of small-molecule approach. 
      The agent is a potent inhibitor of the MBNL1-rCUG complex with an inhibition 
      constant (Ki ) of 25+/-8 nm, and is also relatively nontoxic to HeLa cells, able to 
      dissolve nuclear foci, and correct the insulin receptor splicing defect in DM1 
      model cells. Moreover, treatment with this compound improves two separate disease 
      phenotypes in a Drosophila model of DM1: adult external eye degeneration and 
      larval crawling defect. However, the compound has a relatively low maximum 
      tolerated dose in mice, and its cell uptake may be limited, providing insight 
      into directions for future development.

TI  - Identification of variants in MBNL1 in patients with a myotonic dystrophy-like 
      phenotype.
PG  - 1467-72
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2016.41 [doi]
AB  - The myotonic dystrophies (DMs) are the most common inherited muscular disorders 
      in adults. In most of the cases, the disease is caused by (CTG)n/(CCTG)n repeat 
      expansions (EXPs) in non-coding regions of the genes DMPK (dystrophia 
      myotonica-protein kinase) and CNBP (CCHC-type zinc-finger nucleic acid-binding 
      protein). The EXP is transcribed into mutant RNAs, which provoke a common 
      pathomechanism that is characterized by misexpression and mis-splicing. In this 
      study, we screened 138 patients with typical clinical features of DM being 
      negative for EXP in the known genes. We sequenced DMPK and CNBP - associated with 
      DM, as well as CELF1 (CUGBP, Elav-like family member 1) and MBNL1 
      (muscleblind-like splicing regulator 1) - associated with the pathomechanism of 
      DM, for pathogenic variants, addressing the question whether defects in other 
      genes could cause a DM-like phenotype. We identified variants in three unrelated 
      patients in the MBNL1 gene, two of them were heterozygous missense mutations and 
      one an in-frame deletion of three amino acids. The variants were located in 
      different conserved regions of the protein. The missense mutations were 
      classified as potentially pathogenic by prediction tools. Analysis of MBNL1 
      splice target genes was carried out for one of the patients using RNA from 
      peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL). Analysis of six genes known to show 
      mis-splicing in the skeletal muscle gave no informative results on the effect of 
      this variant when tested in PBL. The association of these variants with the DM 
      phenotype therefore remains unconfirmed, but we hope that in view of the key role 
      of MBNL1 in DM pathogenesis our observations may foster further studies in this 
      direction.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by a CTG 
      repeat expansion in 3'UTR of DMPK gene. This mutation causes accumulation of 
      toxic RNA in nuclear foci leading to splicing misregulation of specific genes. In 
      view of future clinical trials with antisense oligonucleotides in DM1 patients, 
      it is important to set up sensitive and minimally-invasive tools to monitor the 
      efficacy of treatments on skeletal muscle. A tibialis anterior (TA) muscle sample 
      of about 60 mg was obtained from 5 DM1 patients and 5 healthy subjects through a 
      needle biopsy. A fragment of about 40 mg was used for histological examination 
      and a fragment of about 20 mg was used for biomolecular analysis. The TA 
      fragments obtained with the minimally-invasive needle biopsy technique is enough 
      to perform all the histopathological and biomolecular evaluations useful to 
      monitor a clinical trial on DM1 patients.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical, pathological and 
      molecular genetic characteristics of a pedigree with myotonic dystrophy type 1 
      (DM1). A series of clinical data from a pedigree with DM1 were collected. Muscle 
      biopsy revealed a typical nuclear ingression within numerous muscle fibers 
      following hematoxylin and eosin staining. Genomic DNA was extracted from the 
      venous blood of two patients and the triplet-primed polymerase chain reaction 
      method was performed to amplify the dystrophia myotonic protein kinase (DMPK) 
      gene. The amplified products were subjected to gene sequencing by capillary 
      fluorescence electrophoresis, and a pathogenic mutation in the DMPK gene 
      comprising >50 cytosine-thymine-guanine repeat sequences was found. DM1 includes 
      multi-system damage, as well as skeletal muscle involvement, and can affect the 
      central nervous system, endocrine glands, skin and heart. A skeletal muscle 
      biopsy and genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis and clarify the severity of 
      the disease. In addition, it is necessary to distinguish DM1 from DM2.

TI  - Optimization PCR for Detection CTG/CCTG-Repeat Expansions in the Diagnosis of 
      Myotonic Dystrophies.
PG  - 502-7
AB  - CONTEXT: Myotonic dystrophies (DMs) are a group of autosomal dominant 
      neuromuscular disorders which are caused by large CTG/CCTG-repeat expansions in 
      untranslated regions of DMPK/ZNF9 gene. The "phenotypic overlap" in DMs creates 
      complication in distinguishing patients with DM1 from patients with DM2 and 
      underscores the need for these patients to undergo genetic test; therefore, 
      detection and accurate sizing of the CTG/CCTG-repeat expansions are necessary. 
      Templates with long CTG/CCTG tandem repeats are difficult to amplify by 
      convention PCR. AIMS: The aim of our study was to develop an efficient, economic 
      amplification method which based on combination of primer design, modified 
      annealing, and extension conditions in PCR amplification. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: We 
      detected and analyzed the CTG-repeat expansions in patients having clinical, 
      electrophysiological, and muscle pathology features indicative of DMs by 
      optimization PCR. If no CTG-repeat expansions were detected, we subsequently 
      analyzed the CCTG-repeat expansions in the remaining patients. RESULTS: 42 
      participants included 25 DMs patients and 17 family members. 22 patients showed 
      CTG-repeat expansions, the CTG-repeat ranged from 53 to 683 and the average was 
      535; 3 patients showed CCTG-repeat expansions, the CCTG-repeat ranged from 400 to 
      450 and the average was 416. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular genetic tests are essential 
      for DMs diagnosis; Optimization PCR under the optimal conditions of primer 
      design, modified annealing, and extension conditions can be used for efficient 
      PCR in DMs diagnosis; Optimization PCR can greatly improve the positive detection 
      of DMs, provide an economic, accurate, and rapid method for routine diagnostic 
      use.

AB  - CTG repeat expansion in DMPK, the cause of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), 
      frequently results in hypermethylation and reduced SIX5 expression. The 
      contribution of hypermethylation to disease pathogenesis and the precise 
      mechanism by which SIX5 expression is reduced are unknown. Using 14 different 
      DM1-affected human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines, we characterized a 
      differentially methylated region (DMR) near the CTGs. This DMR undergoes 
      hypermethylation as a function of expansion size in a way that is specific to 
      undifferentiated cells and is associated with reduced SIX5 expression. Using 
      functional assays, we provide evidence for regulatory activity of the DMR, which 
      is lost by hypermethylation and may contribute to DM1 pathogenesis by causing 
      SIX5 haplo-insufficiency. This study highlights the power of hESCs in disease 
      modeling and describes a DMR that functions both as an exon coding sequence and 
      as a regulatory element whose activity is epigenetically hampered by a heritable 
      mutation.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Syncope and palpitations as the only initial manifestations of 
      myotonic dystrophy type 1 (MD1) due to a CTG expansion of 50-100 repeats have not 
      been reported. CASE REPORT: In a 55-year-old female with a family history of MD1 
      and a personal history of a single syncope, palpitations, and hyperCKemia, 70 CTG 
      repeats were detected in the DMPK gene. Her brother had presented atypical 
      clinical, electromyographic, and muscle biopsy features since the age of 35 but 
      had been diagnosed with MD1 after he later developed typical distal myotonia. He 
      died suddenly during an episode of syncope at the age of 53. A sister with 
      clinical myotonia died suddenly during sleep at the age of 45 and a second sister 
      with quadriparesis died from complications of intestinal rupture at age 52. A 
      third sister committed suicide at age 40 after developing recurrent syncopes, 
      while a fourth sister had hyperCKemia and foot-extensor weakness. The mother of 
      these five affected children died suddenly from myocardial rupture. CONCLUSIONS: 
      MD1 with <100 CTG repeats may exclusively manifest cardiologically. Family 
      screening for MD1 is important even in asymptomatic patients. MD1 may initially 
      manifest without typical features, while muscle biopsy may be misleading and 
      indicate glycogenosis. Close cardiac follow-up is important if MD1 manifests 
      cardiologically to prevent syncope or sudden cardiac death.

TI  - Anticipation in myotonic dystrophy type 1 parents with small CTG expansions.
PG  - 708-14
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.36950 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy and 
      has the world's highest prevalence in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region, due to a 
      founder effect. This autosomal dominant disorder results from an unstable CTG 
      repeat expansion in DMPK. This region of Canada has had a family screening and 
      predictive testing program for this disorder since 1988. Heterozygotes for small 
      expansions (50-100 CTG repeats) can be asymptomatic or minimally affected. The 
      aim of this study was to assess anticipation for these individuals. At the time 
      of this study, the molecular data of 40 individuals and their 76 affected 
      children were available. We compared 76 parent-child pairs. Most offspring 
      (92.1%) had a larger number of repeats than their parent and the median number of 
      repeats in the offspring was 325 (range, 57-2000). The number of CTG repeats was 
      significantly greater when the mutation was transmitted by a father (median, 425 
      repeats; range, 70-2000), than when it was transmitted by a mother (median, 200 
      repeats; range, 57-1400). The majority (65.8%) of children also had a more severe 
      phenotype than their parent but the sex of the parent had no significant 
      influence on the severity of the child's phenotype. No congenital phenotype was 
      observed. These results confirm that anticipation is present even when the parent 
      is heterozygous for a small CTG expansion. The parental sex has an impact on the 
      size of the repeat in the next generation, larger increases being transmitted by 
      males with a small expansion.

TI  - Primary cataract as a key to recognition of myotonic dystrophy type 1.

AB  - PURPOSE: Primary cataract is often the initial manifestation of the adult-onset 
      type of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), the most common muscular dystrophy in 
      adults. It is caused by a CTG repeat expansion within the DMPK gene, and 
      anticipation may cause earlier onset and more severe symptoms in subsequent 
      generations. METHODS: We report a family with hereditary cataract, which was 
      initially classified as primary hereditary cataract. After presentation of 2 
      children with motor development delay and behavioral changes, DM1 was diagnosed. 
      Subsequently, various DM1 features were recognized in older family members. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This report aims to increase awareness among ophthalmologists of the 
      high prevalence of DM1 among young primary cataract patients. Ophthalmologists 
      can play a significant role in early diagnosis, since cataract frequently is the 
      first occasion that patients seek medical attention. Early recognition is crucial 
      since it enables adequate cardiac follow-up and allows counseling of couples of 
      childbearing age.

AB  - DM1 is caused by CTG repeat expansion in the 3'-UTR of the DMPK gene. DM1 
      patients have expansions of greater than 50 repeats and up to many thousands. The 
      intention of the present study is the establishment of reliable and rapid 
      polymerase chain reaction methodology in early screening of DM1 patients and 
      their family members. PCR followed by TP-PCR was assessed for screening of 27 
      cases (from 26 families) and 75 family members and 300 control samples. All 
      patients had CTG repeat expansion while forty seven (63%) and twenty eight (37%), 
      out of seventy five family members were heterozygous and homozygous respectively. 
      Similarly, two hundred thirty (76.77%) and seventy (23.33%), out of three hundred 
      control subjects were heterozygous and homozygous respectively and the number of 
      repeats varied from 5 to 35. Thirteen complete family screenings were done. Thus, 
      TP-PCR is a reliable and rapid molecular technique for the detection of CTG 
      repeat expansion in DM1.

TI  - Altered nuclear structure in myotonic dystrophy type 1-derived fibroblasts.
PG  - 479-88
LID - 10.1007/s11033-014-3791-4 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystem genetic disorder caused by a 
      triplet nucleotide repeat expansion in the 3' untranslated region of the 
      Dystrophia Myotonica-Protein Kinase (DMPK) gene. DMPK gene transcripts containing 
      CUG expanded repeats accumulate in nuclear foci and ultimately cause altered 
      splicing/gene expression of numerous secondary genes. The study of primary cell 
      cultures derived from patients with DM1 has allowed the identification and 
      further characterization of molecular mechanisms underlying the pathology in the 
      natural context of the disease. In this study we show for the first time impaired 
      nuclear structure in fibroblasts of DM1 patients. DM1-derived fibroblasts 
      exhibited altered localization of the nuclear envelope (NE) proteins emerin and 
      lamins A/C and B1 with concomitant increased size and altered shape of nuclei. 
      Abnormal NE organization is more common in DM1 fibroblasts containing abundant 
      nuclear foci, implying expression of the expanded RNA as determinant of nuclear 
      defects. That transient expression of the DMPK 3' UTR containing 960 CTG but not 
      with the 3' UTR lacking CTG repeats is sufficient to generate NE disruption in 
      normal fibroblasts confirms the direct impact of mutant RNA on NE architecture. 
      We also evidence nucleoli distortion in DM1 fibroblasts by immunostaining of the 
      nucleolar protein fibrillarin, implying a broader effect of the mutant RNA on 
      nuclear structure. In summary, these findings reveal that NE disruption, a 
      hallmark of laminopathy disorders, is a novel characteristic of DM1.

AB  - CUG repeat expansions in the 3' UTR of dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) 
      cause myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). As RNA, these repeats elicit toxicity by 
      sequestering splicing proteins, such as MBNL1, into protein-RNA aggregates. 
      Structural studies demonstrate that CUG repeats can form A-form helices, 
      suggesting that repeat secondary structure could be important in pathogenicity. 
      To evaluate this hypothesis, we utilized structure-stabilizing RNA modifications 
      pseudouridine (Psi) and 2'-O-methylation to determine if stabilization of CUG 
      helical conformations affected toxicity. CUG repeats modified with Psi or 
      2'-O-methyl groups exhibited enhanced structural stability and reduced affinity 
      for MBNL1. Molecular dynamics and X-ray crystallography suggest a potential 
      water-bridging mechanism for Psi-mediated CUG repeat stabilization. Psi modification 
      of CUG repeats rescued mis-splicing in a DM1 cell model and prevented CUG repeat 
      toxicity in zebrafish embryos. This study indicates that the structure of toxic 
      RNAs has a significant role in controlling the onset of neuromuscular diseases.

AB  - RNA toxicity is implicated in a number of disorders; especially those associated 
      with expanded repeat sequences, such as myotonic dystrophy (DM1). Previously, we 
      have shown increased NKX2-5 expression in RNA toxicity associated with DM1. Here, 
      we investigate the relationship between NKX2-5 expression and muscle pathology 
      due to RNA toxicity. In skeletal muscle from mice with RNA toxicity and 
      individuals with DM1, expression of Nkx2-5 or NKX2-5 and its downstream targets 
      are significantly correlated with severity of histopathology. Using C2C12 
      myoblasts, we show that over-expression of NKX2-5 or mutant DMPK 3'UTR results in 
      myogenic differentiation defects, which can be rescued by knockdown of Nkx2-5, 
      despite continued toxic RNA expression. Furthermore, in a mouse model of NKX2-5 
      over-expression, we find defects in muscle regeneration after induced damage, 
      similar to those seen in mice with RNA toxicity. Using mouse models of Nkx2-5 
      over-expression and depletion, we find that NKX2-5 levels modify disease 
      phenotypes in mice with RNA toxicity.

AB  - Expandable (CTG)n repeats in the 3' UTR of the DMPK gene are a cause of myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1 (DM1), which leads to a toxic RNA gain-of-function disease. 
      Mutant RNAs with expanded CUG repeats are retained in the nucleus and aggregate 
      in discrete inclusions. These foci sequester splicing factors of the MBNL family 
      and trigger upregulation of the CUGBP family of proteins resulting in the 
      mis-splicing of their target transcripts. To date, many efforts to develop novel 
      therapeutic strategies have been focused on disrupting the toxic nuclear foci and 
      correcting aberrant alternative splicing via targeting mutant CUG repeats RNA; 
      however, no effective treatment for DM1 is currently available. Herein, we 
      present results of culturing of human DM1 myoblasts and fibroblasts with two 
      small-molecule ATP-binding site-specific kinase inhibitors, C16 and C51, which 
      resulted in the alleviation of the dominant-negative effects of CUG repeat 
      expansion. Reversal of the DM1 molecular phenotype includes a reduction of the 
      size and number of foci containing expanded CUG repeat transcripts, decreased 
      steady-state levels of CUGBP1 protein, and consequent improvement of the aberrant 
      alternative splicing of several pre-mRNAs misregulated in DM1.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disease 
      caused by expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the DMPK gene. Methodology 
      for genetic testing of DM1 is currently not optimal, in particular for the 
      early-onset patients in pediatric populations where large expanded (CTG)n alleles 
      are usually common. Individuals who are homozygous for a normal allele and 
      individuals who are heterozygous for one normal and one large expanded allele are 
      indistinguishable by conventional PCR, as both generate a single product of the 
      normal allele. Thus, reflex Southern blot has often been needed to distinguish 
      these cases. With the aim to decrease the need for reflex Southern blot tests, a 
      novel, single-tube CTG repeat primed PCR technology was designed to distinguish 
      the true homozygous patients from the individuals whose large alleles are missed 
      by conventional PCR. The method utilizes two gene-specific primers that flank the 
      triplet repeat region and a third primer set complementary to the repeated region 
      to detect the large alleles. Compared to traditional PCR, this novel 
      Triplet-repeat Primed PCR can detect the presence of large expanded alleles with 
      demonstrating a ladder pattern. Using this single-step protocol, 45 specimens 
      were tested. The alleles with sizes~i~85 repeats were determined by the gene 
      specific primers. 13 abnormal alleles, which were missed by conventional PCR, 
      were successfully detected by the Triplet-repeat Primed PCR. All the abnormal 
      alleles were confirmed and measured by Southern Blot analysis. In summary, 
      optimized Triplet-Primed PCR (TP-PCR) can accurately detect the presence of the 
      large expanded alleles. With the ability to distinguish the true homozygous 
      patients from the false negative homozygous individuals, the application of the 
      optimized TP-PCR can significantly reduce the need of Southern Blot tests.

AB  - Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) microscopy is a powerful tool used to 
      identify molecular interactions in live or fixed cells using a non-radiative 
      transfer of energy from a donor fluorophore in the excited state to an acceptor 
      fluorophore in close proximity. FRET can be a very sensitive tool to study 
      protein-protein and/or protein-nucleic acids interactions. RNA toxicity is 
      implicated in a number of disorders; especially those associated with expanded 
      repeat sequences, such as myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is caused 
      by a (CTG)n repeat expansion in the 3' UTR of the DMPK gene which results in 
      nuclear retention of mutant DMPK transcripts in RNA foci. This results in toxic 
      gain-of-function effects mediated through altered functions of RNA-binding 
      proteins (e.g. MBNL1, hnRNPH, CUGBP1). In this study we demonstrate the potential 
      of a new acceptor photobleaching assay to measure FRET (AP-FRET) between RNA and 
      protein. We chose to focus on the interaction between MBNL1 and mutant DMPK mRNA 
      in cells from DM1 patients due to the strong microscopic evidence of their 
      co-localization. Using this technique we have direct evidence of intracellular 
      interaction between MBNL1 and the DMPK RNA. Furthermore using the AP-FRET assay 
      and MBNL1 mutants, we show that all four zinc-finger motifs in MBNL1 are crucial 
      for MBNL1-RNA foci interactions. The data derived using this new assay provides 
      compelling evidence for the interaction between RNA binding proteins and RNA 
      foci, and mechanistic insights into MBNL1-RNA foci interaction demonstrating the 
      power of AP-FRET in examining RNA-Protein interactions in DM1.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by the expansion of an unstable CTG 
      repeat located in the 3'-UTR of (DMPK) the DM protein kinase gene. Patients with 
      DM1 have expansions of greater than 50 repeats and up to many thousands. In the 
      present study we aimed to evaluate the utility of TP-PCR in diagnostics as well 
      as the assessment of premutation carriers in proband families. Twenty-seven DM1 
      cases were enrolled (from twenty-six families) and the 13 families of these cases 
      came forward for family screening. The patient group constitute 22 males and 5 
      females and the average age of onset was 32.8 years (range 17 to 52). All 
      clinically diagnosed DM1 cases and their family members DNA samples were analyzed 
      by TP-PCR. All the cases were found to be positive for the CTG repeat expansion. 
      Among those five families, four had at least an asymptomatic carrier. In the 
      remaining one family other than the proband none was found to be neither affected 
      nor asymptomatic. We reconfirmed the utility of PCR based screening for DM1 as 
      being reliable and rapid molecular test and it should be used as an initial 
      screening test for all patients with DM and their family members for initial 
      screening purpose.

AB  - An expanded CTG-repeat in the 3' UTR of the DMPK gene is responsible for myotonic 
      dystrophy type I (DM1). Somatic and intergenerational instability cause the 
      disease to become more severe during life and in subsequent generations. Evidence 
      is accumulating that trinucleotide repeat instability and disease progression 
      involve aberrant chromatin dynamics. We explored the chromatin environment in 
      relation to expanded CTG-repeat tracts in hearts from transgenic mice carrying 
      the DM1 locus with different repeat lengths. Using bisulfite sequencing we 
      detected abundant CpG methylation in the regions flanking the expanded 
      CTG-repeat. CpG methylation was postulated to affect CTCF binding but we found 
      that CTCF binding is not affected by CTG-repeat length in our transgenic mice. We 
      detected significantly decreased DMPK sense and SIX5 transcript expression levels 
      in mice with expanded CTG-repeats. Expression of the DM1 antisense transcript was 
      barely affected by CTG-repeat expansion. In line with altered gene expression, 
      ChIP studies revealed a locally less active chromatin conformation around the 
      expanded CTG-repeat, namely, decreased enrichment of active histone mark 
      H3K9/14Ac and increased H3K9Me3 enrichment (repressive chromatin mark). We also 
      observed binding of PCNA around the repeats, a candidate that could launch 
      chromatin remodelling cascades at expanded repeats, ultimately affecting gene 
      transcription and repeat instability.

AB  - Intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions in ataxin 2 are a risk factor for 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The polyglutamine tract is encoded by a 
      trinucleotide repeat in a coding region of the ataxin 2 gene (ATXN2). Noncoding 
      nucleotide repeat expansions in several genes are also associated with 
      neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. For example, hexanucleotide repeat 
      expansions located in a noncoding region of C9ORF72 are the most common cause of 
      ALS. We sought to assess a potential larger role of noncoding nucleotide repeat 
      expansions in ALS. We analyzed the nucleotide repeat lengths of 6 genes (ATXN8, 
      ATXN10, PPP2R2B, NOP56, DMPK, and JPH3) that have previously been associated with 
      neurologic or neuromuscular disorders, in several hundred sporadic patients with 
      ALS and healthy control subjects. We report no association between ALS and repeat 
      length in any of these genes, suggesting that variation in the noncoding 
      repetitive regions in these genes does not contribute to ALS.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by the expansion of (CTG)n in the 3' 
      untranslated region of the dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase (DMPK) gene, which 
      is transcribed as (CUG)n repeats that accumulate in the nucleus. The RNA repeats 
      specifically sequester or change the expression levels of several RNA-binding 
      proteins, leading to aberrant splicing of many target genes. In this study, we 
      developed artificial site-specific RNA endonucleases (ASREs) that specifically 
      bind and cleave (CUG)n repeats RNA. We have generated one ASRE that can target 
      the expanded RNA repeats in DM1 patient cells and specifically degrade the 
      pathogenic DMPK messenger RNAs with minimal effect on wild-type alleles. Such 
      ASRE treatment significantly decreased the number of nuclear foci in DM1 patient 
      cells and can reverse the missplicing of many genes affected in DM1 patients. 
      Taken together, the application of ASRE provides a new route of gene therapy for 
      DM1 treatment.

LID - 10.1242/dmm.012427 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) is a multi-system, autosomal dominant disorder 
      caused by expansion of a CTG repeat sequence in the 3'UTR of the DMPK gene. The 
      size of the repeat sequence correlates with age at onset and disease severity, 
      with large repeats leading to congenital forms of DM1 associated with hypotonia 
      and intellectual disability. In models of adult DM1, expanded CUG repeats lead to 
      an RNA toxic gain of function, mediated at least in part by sequestering specific 
      RNA splicing proteins, most notably muscleblind-related (MBNL) proteins. However, 
      the impact of CUG RNA repeat expression on early developmental processes is not 
      well understood. To better understand early developmental processes in DM1, we 
      utilized the zebrafish, Danio rerio, as a model system. Direct injection of 
      (CUG)91 repeat-containing mRNA into single-cell embryos induces toxicity in the 
      nervous system and muscle during early development. These effects manifest as 
      abnormal morphology, behavioral abnormalities and broad transcriptional changes, 
      as shown by cDNA microarray analysis. Co-injection of zebrafish mbnl2 RNA 
      suppresses (CUG)91 RNA toxicity and reverses the associated behavioral and 
      transcriptional abnormalities. Taken together, these findings suggest that early 
      expression of exogenously transcribed CUG repeat RNA can disrupt normal muscle 
      and nervous system development and provides a new model for DM1 research that is 
      amenable to small-molecule therapeutic development.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is a multisystemic disease caused by an expansion of CTG 
      repeats in the region of DMPK, the gene encoding DM protein kinase. The severity 
      of muscle disability in DM1 correlates with the size of CTG expansion. As 
      respiratory failure is one of the main causes of death in DM1, we investigated 
      the correlation between respiratory impairment and size of the (CTG)n repeat in 
      DM1 animal models. Using pressure plethysmography the respiratory function was 
      assessed in control and transgenic mice carrying either 600 (DM600) or >1300 CTG 
      repeats (DMSXL). The statistical analysis of respiratory parameters revealed that 
      both DM1 transgenic mice sub-lines show respiratory impairment compared to 
      control mice. In addition, there is no significant difference in breathing 
      functions between the DM600 and DMSXL mice. In conclusion, these results indicate 
      that respiratory impairment is present in both transgenic mice sub-lines, but the 
      severity of respiratory failure is not related to the size of the (CTG)n 
      expansion.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy is a progressive multisystem genetic disorder affecting about 
      1 in 8000 people worldwide. The unstable repeat expansions of (CTG)n or (CCTG)n 
      in the DMPK and ZNF9 genes cause the two known subtypes of myotonic dystrophy: 
      (i) myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and (ii) myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) 
      respectively. There is currently no cure but supportive management helps equally 
      to reduce the morbidity and mortality and patients need close follow up to pay 
      attention to their clinical problems. This review will focus on the clinical 
      features, molecular view and genetics, diagnosis and management of DM1.

AB  - Expansions of CUG trinucleotide sequences in RNA transcripts provide the basis 
      for toxic RNA gain-of-function that leads to detrimental changes in RNA 
      metabolism. A CTG repeat element normally resides in the 3' untranslated region 
      of the dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase (DMPK) gene, but when expanded it is 
      the genetic lesion of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), a hereditary neuromuscular 
      disease. The pathogenic DMPK transcript containing the CUG expansion is retained 
      in ribonuclear foci as part of a complex with RNA-binding proteins such as 
      muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1), resulting in aberrant splicing of numerous RNA 
      transcripts and consequent physiological abnormalities including myotonia. 
      Herein, we demonstrate molecular and physiological amelioration of the toxic 
      effects of mutant RNA in the HSA(LR) mouse model of DM1 by systemic 
      administration of peptide-linked morpholino (PPMO) antisense oligonucleotides 
      bearing a CAG repeat sequence. Intravenous administration of PPMO conjugates to 
      HSA(LR) mice led to redistribution of Mbnl1 protein in myonuclei and corrections 
      in abnormal RNA splicing. Additionally, myotonia was completely eliminated in 
      PPMO-treated HSA(LR) mice. These studies provide proof of concept that 
      neutralization of RNA toxicity by systemic delivery of antisense oligonucleotides 
      that target the CUG repeat is an effective therapeutic approach for treating the 
      skeletal muscle aspects of DM1 pathology.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder that is 
      caused by the expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the DMPK gene. The 
      confirmation of a clinical diagnosis of DM-1 usually involves PCR amplification 
      of the CTG repeat-containing region and subsequent sizing of the amplification 
      products in order to deduce the number of CTG repeats. In the case of repeat 
      hyperexpansions, Southern blotting is also used; however, the latter has largely 
      been superseded by triplet repeat-primed PCR (TP-PCR), which does not yield a CTG 
      repeat number but nevertheless provides a means of stratifying patients regarding 
      their disease severity. We report here a combination of forward and reverse 
      TP-PCR primers that allows for the simple and effective scoring of both the size 
      of smaller alleles and the presence or absence of expanded repeat sequences. In 
      addition, the CTG repeat-containing TP-PCR forward primer can target both the 
      DM-1 and Huntington disease genes, thereby streamlining the work flow for 
      confirmation of clinical diagnoses in a diagnostic laboratory.

AB  - We assessed clinical, molecular and muscle histopathological features in five 
      unrelated Italian DM1 patients carrying novel variant pathological expansions 
      containing CCG interruptions within the 3'-end of the CTG array at the DMPK 
      locus, detected by bidirectional triplet primed PCR (TP-PCR) and sequencing. 
      Three patients had a negative DM1 testing by routine long-range PCR; the other 
      two patients were identified among 100 unrelated DM1 cases and re-evaluated to 
      estimate the prevalence of variant expansions. The overall prevalence was 4.8 % 
      in our study cohort. There were no major clinical differences between variant and 
      non-variant DM1 patients, except for cognitive involvement. Muscle RNA-FISH, 
      immunofluorescence for MBNL1 and RT-PCR analysis documented the presence of 
      ribonuclear inclusions, their co-localization with MBNL1, and an aberrant 
      splicing pattern involved in DM1 pathogenesis, without any obvious differences 
      between variant and non-variant DM1 patients. Therefore, this study shows that 
      the CCG interruptions at the 3'-end of expanded DMPK alleles do not produce 
      qualitative effects on the RNA-mediated toxic gain-of-function in DM1 muscle 
      tissues. Finally, our results support the conclusion that different patterns of 
      CCG interruptions within the CTG array could modulate the DM1 clinical phenotype, 
      variably affecting the mutational dynamics of the variant repeat.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by an unstable CTG repeat expansion in 
      the 3'UTR of the DM protein kinase (DMPK) gene. DMPK transcripts carrying CUG 
      expansions form nuclear foci and affect splicing regulation of various RNA 
      transcripts. Furthermore, bidirectional transcription over the DMPK gene and 
      non-conventional RNA translation of repeated transcripts have been described in 
      DM1. It is clear now that this disease may involve multiple pathogenic pathways 
      including changes in gene expression, RNA stability and splicing regulation, 
      protein translation, and micro-RNA metabolism. We previously generated transgenic 
      mice with 45-kb of the DM1 locus and >300 CTG repeats (DM300 mice). After 
      successive breeding and a high level of CTG repeat instability, we obtained 
      transgenic mice carrying >1,000 CTG (DMSXL mice). Here we described for the first 
      time the expression pattern of the DMPK sense transcripts in DMSXL and human 
      tissues. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that DMPK antisense transcripts are 
      expressed in various DMSXL and human tissues, and that both sense and antisense 
      transcripts accumulate in independent nuclear foci that do not co-localize 
      together. Molecular features of DM1-associated RNA toxicity in DMSXL mice (such 
      as foci accumulation and mild missplicing), were associated with high mortality, 
      growth retardation, and muscle defects (abnormal histopathology, reduced muscle 
      strength, and lower motor performances). We have found that lower levels of 
      IGFBP-3 may contribute to DMSXL growth retardation, while increased proteasome 
      activity may affect muscle function. These data demonstrate that the human DM1 
      locus carrying very large expansions induced a variety of molecular and 
      physiological defects in transgenic mice, reflecting DM1 to a certain extent. As 
      a result, DMSXL mice provide an animal tool to decipher various aspects of the 
      disease mechanisms. In addition, these mice can be used to test the preclinical 
      impact of systemic therapeutic strategies on molecular and physiological 
      phenotypes.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an RNA dominant disease caused by expression 
      of DM protein kinase (DMPK) transcripts that contain an expanded CUG repeat 
      (CUG(exp)). The toxic mRNA localizes to nuclear foci and sequesters proteins 
      involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, such as, muscleblind-like 1 
      (MBNL1). Here, we used synthetic short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to target CUG 
      repeats and test the concept that inhibiting the expression of CUG(exp) RNA can 
      mitigate features of DM1 in transgenic mice. Intramuscular injection and 
      electroporation of siRNA resulted in ~70-80% downregulation of CUG(exp) 
      transcripts. A limited survey of endogenous mouse transcripts that contain 
      nonexpanded CUG or CAG repeats showed that most were not affected, though Txlnb 
      containing (CUG)(9) was significantly reduced. By this strategy, the number and 
      intensity of CUG(exp) nuclear foci were reduced and splicing of MBNL1-dependent 
      exons was improved. These data suggest that the expanded CUG repeats are a 
      potential target for allele-selective RNA interference.

TI  - MBNL1 gene variants as modifiers of disease severity in myotonic dystrophy type 
      1.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystemic autosomal dominant disorder 
      characterized by a highly variable phenotype and caused by an unstable CTG repeat 
      expansion in the 3' untranslated region of the dystrophia myotonica protein 
      kinase (DMPK) gene. Longer CTG repeat expansions often correlate with an 
      anticipated age at onset and CTG repeat number may account for 45-60 % of the 
      variance in disease severity. In order to search for candidate genes that could 
      act as modifiers of disease severity, we studied the association between 
      Muscleblind-like protein-1 (MBNL1) gene polymorphisms and the DM1 phenotype. In a 
      group of 301 patients diagnosed with DM1 based on clinical symptoms, diagnosis 
      was confirmed by molecular analysis of the DMPK gene. Patients were divided into 
      four subtypes. The first subtype corresponded to asymptomatic patients or those 
      with a mild phenotype, the second included those with a classic phenotype, the 
      third concerned childhood onset, and the fourth corresponded to the congenital 
      form of DM1. Three SNPs located in the MBNL1 gene promoter, rs323622, rs17283597, 
      and rs17433672, were studied. Case-control analysis revealed that allele 
      frequencies for the latter two were significantly associated with DM1 (p = 0.037 
      and p = 0.020). Multivariate linear regression analysis using phenotype as the 
      dependent variable demonstrated that the TT genotype of the third SNP, rs323622, 
      was associated with a more severe phenotype (p = 0.0034) and accounted for 1.88 % 
      of the variance in disease severity. We report the association of several genetic 
      variants of the MBNL1 gene with DM1 or with the severity of the disease.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal-dominant disease caused by an 
      expansion of CTG repeats in the 3' untranslated region of the Dystrophia 
      Myotonica Protein Kinase (DMPK) gene. Detection and accurate sizing of the 
      CTG-repeat expansions is clinically important, because the number of CTG repeats 
      correlates with the disease severity. Because difficulties in PCR amplification 
      over large expansions, molecular diagnosis of DM1 is still primarily based on 
      Southern blotting, which is technically demanding and time consuming and requires 
      large amounts of genomic DNA samples. We have recently discovered that the use of 
      multiple heat pulses during Heat Pulse Extension PCR (HPE-PCR) enables efficient 
      amplification over repetitive and GC-rich sequences. Based on this principle, we 
      have developed an assay for efficient amplification of large CTG-repeat 
      expansions seen in DM1 patients. The HPE-PCR method was able to amplify different 
      DMPK1 repeat expansions of up to 1750 CTG repeats in 78 clinical samples with a 
      varying degree of tissue heterogeneity, even in the presence of the short 
      wild-type allele. The CTG-repeat lengths and fragmentation patterns obtained with 
      HPE-PCR were fully concordant with the original diagnostic Southern blotting 
      results. This novel technique provides a PCR-based platform for molecular 
      diagnosis of DM1, and it has been adopted for routine diagnostic use.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by the expansion of CTG repeats in the 
      3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. Several missplicing events and 
      transcriptional alterations have been described in DM1 patients. A large number 
      of these defects have been reproduced in animal models expressing CTG repeats 
      alone. Recent studies have also reported miRNA dysregulation in DM1 patients. In 
      this work, a Drosophila model was used to investigate miRNA transcriptome 
      alterations in the muscle, specifically triggered by CTG expansions. Twenty 
      miRNAs were differentially expressed in CTG-expressing flies. Of these, 19 were 
      down-regulated, whereas 1 was up-regulated. This trend was confirmed for those 
      miRNAs conserved between Drosophila and humans (miR-1, miR-7 and miR-10) in 
      muscle biopsies from DM1 patients. Consistently, at least seven target 
      transcripts of these miRNAs were up-regulated in DM1 skeletal muscles. The 
      mechanisms involved in dysregulation of miR-7 included a reduction of its primary 
      precursor both in CTG-expressing flies and in DM1 patients. Additionally, a 
      regulatory role for Muscleblind (Mbl) was also suggested for miR-1 and miR-7, as 
      these miRNAs were down-regulated in flies where Mbl had been silenced. Finally, 
      the physiological relevance of miRNA dysregulation was demonstrated for miR-10, 
      since over-expression of this miRNA in Drosophila extended the lifespan of 
      CTG-expressing flies. Taken together, our results contribute to our understanding 
      of the origin and the role of miRNA alterations in DM1.

LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2012.108 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder that is 
      characterized by myotonic myopathy. The symptoms and severity of myotonic 
      dystrophy type l (DM1) ranges from severe and congenital forms, which frequently 
      result in death because of respiratory deficiency, through to late-onset baldness 
      and cataract. In adult patients, cardiac conduction abnormalities may occur and 
      cause a shorter life span. In subsequent generations, the symptoms in DM1 may 
      present at an earlier age and have a more severe course (anticipation). In 
      myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), no anticipation is described, but cardiac 
      conduction abnormalities as in DM1 are observed and patients with DM2 
      additionally have muscle pain and stiffness. Both DM1 and DM2 are caused by 
      unstable DNA repeats in untranslated regions of different genes: A (CTG)n repeat 
      in the 3'-UTR of the DMPK gene and a (CCTG)n repeat in intron 1 of the CNBP 
      (formerly ZNF9) gene, respectively. The length of the (CTG)n repeat expansion in 
      DM1 correlates with disease severity and age of onset. Nevertheless, these repeat 
      sizes have limited predictive values on individual bases. Because of the disease 
      characteristics in DM1 and DM2, appropriate molecular testing and reporting is 
      very important for the optimal counseling in myotonic dystrophy. Here, we 
      describe best practice guidelines for clinical molecular genetic analysis and 
      reporting in DM1 and DM2, including presymptomatic and prenatal testing.

TI  - Somatic instability of the expanded CTG triplet repeat in myotonic dystrophy type 
      1 is a heritable quantitative trait and modifier of disease severity.
PG  - 3558-67
LID - 10.1093/hmg/dds185 [doi]
AB  - Deciphering the contribution of genetic instability in somatic cells is critical 
      to our understanding of many human disorders. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is 
      one such disorder that is caused by the expansion of a CTG repeat that shows 
      extremely high levels of somatic instability. This somatic instability has 
      compromised attempts to measure intergenerational repeat dynamics and infer 
      genotype-phenotype relationships. Using single-molecule PCR, we have 
      characterized more than 17 000 de novo somatic mutations from a large cohort of 
      DM1 patients. These data reveal that the estimated progenitor allele length is 
      the major modifier of age of onset. We find no evidence for a threshold above 
      which repeat length does not contribute toward age at onset, suggesting 
      pathogenesis is not constrained to a simple molecular switch such as nuclear 
      retention of the DMPK transcript or haploinsufficiency for DMPK and/or SIX5. 
      Importantly, we also show that age at onset is further modified by the level of 
      somatic instability; patients in whom the repeat expands more rapidly, develop 
      the symptoms earlier. These data establish a primary role for somatic instability 
      in DM1 severity, further highlighting it as a therapeutic target. In addition, we 
      show that the level of instability is highly heritable, implying a role for 
      individual-specific trans-acting genetic modifiers. Identifying these 
      trans-acting genetic modifiers will facilitate the formulation of novel therapies 
      that curtail the accumulation of somatic expansions and may provide clues to the 
      role these factors play in the development of cancer, aging and inherited disease 
      in the general population.

TI  - A role for PLCbeta1 in myotonic dystrophies type 1 and 2.
PG  - 3042-8
LID - 10.1096/fj.11-200337 [doi]
AB  - Phosphoinositide-phospholipase C beta1 (PLCbeta1) plays a crucial role in the 
      initiation of the genetic program responsible for muscle differentiation. We 
      previously demonstrated that nuclear PLCbeta1 activates the cyclin D3 promoter 
      during the differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes, indicating that PLCbeta1 is 
      essential for cyclin D3 promoter activation and gene transcription, through 
      c-jun/AP1. Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the most prevalent form of muscular 
      dystrophy in adults. DM type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2) are dominantly inherited 
      multisystem disorders. DM1 is triggered by the pathological expansion of a 
      (CTG)(n) triplet repeat in the gene coding for DMPK, the dystrophia 
      myotonica-protein kinase, whereas a (CCTG)(n) tetranucleotide repeat expansion in 
      the ZNF9 gene, encoding a CCHC-type zinc finger protein, causes DM2. We found 
      that, unlike in normal myotubes, the level of expression of PLCbeta1 in DM1 and DM2 
      cells was already elevated in proliferating cells. Treatment with insulin induced 
      a dramatic decrease in the amount of PLCbeta1. During differentiation, cyclin D3 and 
      myogenin were elevated in normal myotubes, whereas differentiating DM1 and DM2 
      cells did not increase these proteins. Forced expression of PLCbeta1 in DM1 and DM2 
      cells increased the expression of differentiation markers, myogenin and cyclin 
      D3, and enhanced fusion of DM myoblasts. These results highlight again that PLCbeta1 
      expression is a key player in myoblast differentiation, functioning as a positive 
      regulator in the correction of delayed differentiation of skeletal muscle in DM 
      human myoblasts.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multi-systemic disorder caused by a CTG 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion (CTG(exp)) in the DMPK gene. In skeletal muscle, 
      nuclear sequestration of the alternative splicing factor muscleblind-like 1 
      (MBNL1) explains the majority of the alternative splicing defects observed in the 
      HSA(LR) transgenic mouse model which expresses a pathogenic range CTG(exp). In 
      the present study, we addressed the possibility that MBNL1 sequestration by 
      CUG(exp) RNA also contributes to splicing defects in the mammalian brain. We 
      examined RNA from the brains of homozygous Mbnl1(DeltaE3/DeltaE3) knockout mice using 
      splicing-sensitive microarrays. We used RT-PCR to validate a subset of 
      alternative cassette exons identified by microarray analysis with brain tissues 
      from Mbnl1(DeltaE3/DeltaE3) knockout mice and post-mortem DM1 patients. Surprisingly, 
      splicing-sensitive microarray analysis of Mbnl1(DeltaE3/DeltaE3) brains yielded only 14 
      candidates for mis-spliced exons. While we confirmed that several of these 
      splicing events are perturbed in both Mbnl1 knockout and DM1 brains, the extent 
      of splicing mis-regulation in the mouse model was significantly less than 
      observed in DM1. Additionally, several alternative exons, including Grin1 exon 4, 
      App exon 7 and Mapt exons 3 and 9, which have previously been reported to be 
      aberrantly spliced in human DM1 brain, were spliced normally in the Mbnl1 
      knockout brain. The sequestration of MBNL1 by CUG(exp) RNA results in some of the 
      aberrant splicing events in the DM1 brain. However, we conclude that other 
      factors, possibly other MBNL proteins, likely contribute to splicing 
      mis-regulation in the DM1 brain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is the most common muscle dystrophy 
      in adults. The disease is caused by a triplet expansion in the 3'end of the 
      myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene. In order to develop a human cell 
      model for investigation of possible effects of antisense and RNAi effector 
      molecules we have used lentiviral mediated myoD-forced myogenesis of DM1 patient 
      fibroblasts. FINDINGS: Transduced fibroblasts show a multinuclear phenotype and 
      express the differentiation marker myogenin. Furthermore, fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed a statistical significant increase in the 
      amount of nuclear foci in DM1 patient fibroblasts after myogenesis. Finally, no 
      nuclear foci were found after treatment with oligonucleotides targeting the 
      repeat expansions. CONCLUSIONS: The abundance of nuclear foci in DM1 patient 
      fibroblasts increase following myogenesis, as visualized by FISH analysis. Foci 
      were eradicated after treatment with antisense oligonucleotides. Thus, we propose 
      that the current cell model is suitable for testing of novel treatment 
      modalities.

TI  - Activation of the innate immune response and interferon signalling in myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1 and type 2 cataracts.
PG  - 852-62
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddr515 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by a triplet repeat expansion in the non-coding 
      region of either the DMPK (DM1) or CNBP (DM2) gene. Transcription of the expanded 
      region causes accumulation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in DM cells. We sought 
      to determine how expression of triplet repeat RNA causes the varied phenotype 
      typical of DM. Global transcription was measured in DM and non-DM cataract 
      samples using Illumina Bead Arrays. DM samples were compared with non-DM samples 
      and lists of differentially expressed genes (P</= 0.05) were prepared. Gene set 
      enrichment analysis and the Interferome database were used to search for 
      significant patterns of gene expression in DM cells. Expression of individual 
      genes was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. DMPK 
      and CNBP expression was confirmed in native lens cells showing that a toxic RNA 
      gain of function mechanism could exist in lens. A high proportion, 83% in DM1 and 
      75% in DM2, of the significantly disregulated genes were shared by both forms of 
      the disease, suggesting a common mechanism. The upregulated genes in DM1 and DM2 
      were highly enriched in both interferon-regulated genes (IRGs) and genes 
      associated with the response to dsRNA and the innate immune response. The 
      characteristic fingerprint of IRGs and the signalling pathways identified in lens 
      cells support a role for dsRNA activation of the innate immune response in the 
      pathology of DM. This new evidence forms the basis for a novel hypothesis to 
      explain the complex mechanism of DM.

TI  - Stabilization of expanded (CTG)*(CAG) repeats by antisense oligonucleotides.
PG  - 2222-7
LID - 10.1038/mt.2011.191 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by expansion of a CTG repeat in the 
      gene DMPK. The expansion is highly unstable in somatic cells, a feature that may 
      contribute to disease progression. The RNA expressed from the mutant allele 
      exerts a toxic gain of function, due to the presence of an expanded CUG repeat 
      (CUG(exp)). This RNA dominant mechanism is amenable to therapeutic intervention 
      with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). For example, CAG-repeat ASOs that bind 
      CUG(exp) RNA are beneficial in DM1 models by altering the protein interactions or 
      metabolism of the toxic RNA. Because CUG(exp) RNA has been shown to aggravate 
      instability of expanded CTG repeats, we studied whether CAG-repeat ASOs may also 
      affect this aspect of DM1. In human cells the instability of (CTG)(800) was 
      suppressed by addition of CAG-repeat ASOs to the culture media. In mice that 
      carry a DMPK transgene the somatic instability of (CTG)(800) was suppressed by 
      direct injection of CAG-repeat ASOs into muscle tissue. These results raise the 
      possibility that early intervention with ASOs to reduce RNA or protein toxicity 
      may have the additional benefit of stabilizing CTG:CAG repeats at subpathogenic 
      lengths.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1) is a multisystemic disease caused by a triplet 
      nucleotide repeat expansion in the 3' untranslated region of the gene coding for 
      myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK). DMPK is a nuclear envelope (NE) protein 
      that promotes myogenic gene expression in skeletal myoblasts. Muscular dystrophy 
      research has revealed the NE to be a key determinant of nuclear structure, gene 
      regulation, and muscle function. To investigate the role of DMPK in NE stability, 
      we analyzed DMPK expression in epithelial and myoblast cells. We found that DMPK 
      localizes to the NE and coimmunoprecipitates with Lamin-A/C. Overexpression of 
      DMPK in HeLa cells or C2C12 myoblasts disrupts Lamin-A/C and Lamin-B1 
      localization and causes nuclear fragmentation. Depletion of DMPK also disrupts NE 
      lamina, showing that DMPK is required for NE stability. Our data demonstrate for 
      the first time that DMPK is a critical component of the NE. These novel findings 
      suggest that reduced DMPK may contribute to NE instability, a common mechanism of 
      skeletal muscle wasting in muscular dystrophies.

PG  - 1703-14
LID - 10.1242/jcs.073270 [doi]
AB  - Transcripts containing expanded CNG repeats, which are found in several 
      neuromuscular diseases, are not exported from the nucleus and aggregate as 
      ribonuclear inclusions by an unknown mechanism. Using the MS2-GFP system, which 
      tethers fluorescent proteins to a specific mRNA, we followed the dynamics of 
      single CUG-repeat transcripts and RNA aggregation in living cells. Single 
      transcripts with 145 CUG repeats from the dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase 
      (DMPK) gene had reduced diffusion kinetics compared with transcripts containing 
      only five CUG repeats. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) 
      experiments showed that CUG-repeat RNAs display a stochastic aggregation 
      behaviour, because individual RNA foci formed at different rates and displayed 
      different recoveries. Spontaneous clustering of CUG-repeat RNAs was also 
      observed, confirming the stochastic aggregation revealed by FRAP. The splicing 
      factor Mbnl1 colocalized with individual CUG-repeat transcripts and its 
      aggregation with RNA foci displayed the same stochastic behaviour as CUG-repeat 
      mRNAs. Moreover, depletion of Mbnl1 by RNAi resulted in decreased aggregation of 
      CUG-repeat transcripts after FRAP, supporting a direct role for Mbnl1 in CUG-rich 
      RNA foci formation. Our data reveal that nuclear CUG-repeat RNA aggregates are 
      labile, constantly forming and disaggregating structures, and that the Mbnl1 
      splicing factor is directly involved in the aggregation process.

TI  - Zebrafish deficient for Muscleblind-like 2 exhibit features of myotonic 
      dystrophy.
PG  - 381-92
LID - 10.1242/dmm.004150 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM; also known as dystrophia myotonica) is an autosomal 
      dominant disorder that affects the heart, eyes, brain and endocrine system, but 
      the predominant symptoms are neuromuscular, with progressive muscle weakness and 
      wasting. DM presents in two forms, DM1 and DM2, both of which are caused by 
      nucleotide repeat expansions: CTG in the DMPK gene for DM1 and CCTG in ZNF9 
      (CNBP) for DM2. Previous studies have shown that the mutant mRNAs containing the 
      transcribed CUG or CCUG repeats are retained within the nuclei of cells from 
      individuals with DM, where they bind and sequester the muscleblind-like proteins 
      MBNL1, MBNL2 and MBNL3. It has been proposed that the sequestration of these 
      proteins plays a key role in determining the classic features of DM. However, the 
      functions of each of the three MBNL genes are not completely understood. We have 
      generated a zebrafish knockdown model in which we demonstrate that a lack of 
      mbnl2 function causes morphological abnormalities at the eye, heart, brain and 
      muscle levels, supporting an essential role for mbnl2 during embryonic 
      development. Major features of DM are replicated in our model, including muscle 
      defects and splicing abnormalities. We found that the absence of mbnl2 causes 
      disruption to the organization of myofibrils in skeletal and heart muscle of 
      zebrafish embryos, and a reduction in the amount of both slow and fast muscle 
      fibres. Notably, our findings included altered splicing patterns of two 
      transcripts whose expression is also altered in DM patients: clcn1 and tnnt2. The 
      studies described herein provide broader insight into the functions of MBNL2. 
      They also lend support to the hypothesis that the sequestration of this protein 
      is an important determinant in DM pathophysiology, and imply a direct role of 
      MBNL2 in splicing regulation of specific transcripts, which, when altered, 
      contributes to the DM phenotype.

TI  - Neuropathology does not Correlate with Regional Differences in the Extent of 
      Expansion of CTG Repeats in the Brain with Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1.
PG  - 149-56
LID - 10.1267/ahc.10019 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is known to be an adult-onset muscular dystrophy caused 
      by the expansion of CTG repeats within the 3' untranslated region of the 
      dystrophin myotonin protein kinase (DMPK) gene. The clinical features of DM1 
      include CNS symptoms, such as cognitive impairment and personality changes, the 
      pathogenesis of which remains to be elucidated. We hypothesized that the 
      distribution of neuropathological changes might be correlated with the extent of 
      the length of the CTG repeats in the DMPK genes in DM1 patients. We studied the 
      neuropathological changes in the brains of subjects with DM1 and investigated the 
      extent of somatic instability in terms of CTG repeat expansion in the different 
      brain regions of the same individuals by Southern blot analysis. The 
      neuropathological changes included etat crible in the cerebral deep white matter 
      and neurofibrillary tangles immunoreactive for phosphorylated tau in the 
      hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, both of which were compatible with the 
      subcortical dementia in DM1 patients. However, the length of the CTG repeats did 
      not correlate with the regional differences in the extent of neuropathological 
      changes. Our data suggested that pathomechanisms of dementia in DM1 might be more 
      multifactorial rather than a toxic gain-of-function due to mutant RNA.

AB  - Myotonia is characterized by hyperexcitability of the muscle cell membrane. 
      Myotonic disorders are divided into two main categories: non-dystrophic and 
      dystrophic myotonias. The non-dystrophic myotonias involve solely the muscle 
      system, whereas the dystrophic myotonias are characterized by multisystem 
      involvement and additional muscle weakness. Each category is further subdivided 
      into different groups according to additional clinical features or/and underlying 
      genetic defects. However, the phenotypes and the pathological mechanisms of these 
      myotonic disorders are still not entirely understood. Currently, four genes are 
      identified to be involved in myotonia: the muscle voltage-gated sodium and 
      chloride channel genes SCN4A and CLCN1, the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase 
      (DMPK) gene, and the CCHC-type zinc finger, nucleic acid binding protein gene 
      CNBP. Additional gene(s) and/or modifying factor(s) remain to be identified. In 
      this study, we investigated a large Norwegian family with clinically different 
      presentations of myotonic disorders. Molecular analysis revealed CCTG repeat 
      expansions in the CNBP gene in all affected members, confirming that they have 
      myotonic dystrophy type 2. However, a CLCN1 mutation c.1238C>G, causing 
      p.Phe413Cys, was also identified in several affected family members. 
      Heterozygosity for p.Phe413Cys seems to exaggerate the severity of myotonia and 
      thereby, to some degree, contributing to the pronounced variability in the 
      myotonic phenotype in this family.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy is a multisystemic disorder characterized by repeat expansion 
      mutations of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene resulting in a 
      defective muscular insulin receptor and insulin resistance. We describe a patient

TI  - CTG repeat lengths of the DMPK gene in myotonic dystrophy patients compared to 
      healthy controls in Thailand.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is frequently associated with large expansions of the 
      cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) repeat in the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase 
      gene (DMPK). The frequency of distribution of the CTG repeat length in normal 
      alleles of several populations is well correlated with the prevalence of DM. 
      Therefore, we studied the CTG repeat length of the DMPK gene in DM patients and 
      controls in Thailand. Only seven typical patients with DM from six unrelated 
      families were identified, all with large pathological CTG repeat expansions (> 
      400 repeats) in the DMPK gene. Only 2.75% of controls had normal CTG repeat 
      alleles > 18 repeats. The frequency distribution of the CTG-repeat alleles in the 
      normal Thai population is similar to that of the Taiwanese population (chi(2) with 
      Yates correction = 1.393; p = 0.2379). These data suggest that the incidence of 
      DM might be rare in Thailand, where the risk of developing DM is possibly similar 
      to that in Taiwan.

TI  - Distribution of CTG repeats at the DMPK gene in myotonic dystrophy patients and 
      healthy individuals from the Mexican population.
PG  - 1341-6

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), the most common form of adult muscular 
      dystrophy, is caused by anormal expansion of CTG trinucleotide repeats located in 
      the 3'-untranslated region of the DMPK gene. The clinical features of DM1 are 
      multisystemic and highly variable, and the unstable nature of CTG expansion 
      causes wide genotypic and phenotypic presentations. In this study, we described 
      to our knowledge for the first time the molecular diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy 
      type 1 patients in the Mexican population, applying a fluorescent PCR method in 
      combination with capillary electrophoresis analysis of the amplified products. We 
      identified expanded alleles in 45 out of 50 patients (90%) with clinical features 
      of myotonic disease. Furthermore, genotyping of 400 healthy subjects revealed the 
      presence of 25 different alleles, ranging in size from 5 to 34 repeats. The most 
      frequent allele was 13 CTG repeats (38.87%) and the frequency for alleles over 18 
      CTG repeats was 6.7%. Molecular test is essential for DM1 diagnosis and 
      distribution of the CTG repeat alleles present in the Mexican population are 
      significantly different from those of other populations.

TI  - CUGBP1 overexpression in mouse skeletal muscle reproduces features of myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1.
PG  - 3614-22
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddq277 [doi]
AB  - The neuromuscular disease myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) affects multiple organ 
      systems with the major symptoms being severe muscle weakness, progressive muscle 
      wasting and myotonia. The causative mutation in DM1 is a CTG repeat expansion in 
      the 3'-untranslated region of the DM protein kinase (DMPK) gene. RNA transcribed 
      from the expanded allele contains the expanded CUG repeats and leads to the 
      nuclear depletion of Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) and to the increased steady-state 
      levels of CUG-binding protein 1 (CUGBP1). The pathogenic effects of MBNL1 
      depletion have previously been tested by the generation of MBNL1 knockout mice, 
      but the consequence of CUGBP1 overexpression in adult muscle is not known. In a 
      DM1 mouse model expressing RNA containing 960 CUG repeats in skeletal muscle, 
      CUGBP1 up-regulation is temporally correlated with severe muscle wasting. In this 
      study, we generated transgenic mice with doxycycline-inducible and skeletal 
      muscle-specific expression of CUGBP1. Adult mouse skeletal muscle overexpressing 
      CUGBP1 reproduces molecular and physiological defects of DM1 tissue. The results 
      from this study strongly suggest that CUGBP1 has a major role in DM1 skeletal 
      muscle pathogenesis.

TI  - Progressive skeletal muscle weakness in transgenic mice expressing CTG expansions 
      is associated with the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

LID - 10.1016/j.nmd.2010.03.006 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a neuromuscular disease caused by the 
      expansion of a CTG repeat in the DMPK gene and characterised by progressive 
      skeletal muscle weakness and wasting. To investigate the effects of the CTG 
      expansion on the physiological function of the skeletal muscles, we have used a 
      transgenic mouse model carrying the human DM1 region with 550 expanded CTG 
      repeats. Maximal force is reduced in the skeletal muscles of 10-month-old but not 
      in 3-month-old DM1 mice when compared to age-matched non-transgenic littermates. 
      The progressive weakness observed in the DM1 mice is directly related to the 
      reduced muscle mass and muscle fibre size. A significant increase in trypsin-like 
      proteasome activity and Fbxo32 expression is also measured in the DM1 muscles 
      indicating that an atrophic process mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway 
      may contribute to the progressive muscle wasting and weakness in the DM1 mice.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a multisystemic neuromuscular disorder caused by a 
      dynamic mutation of (CTG) trinucleotide repeats in the 3' untranslated region of 
      the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase gene (DMPK). The aim of the present study 
      was to establish the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based simple and 
      rapid method for initial sample screening. Only a minority of samples were tested 
      positive with the above method and need to be detected by tri primer (TP)-PCR and 
      Southern blotting which is more time consuming and involves use of radioactive 
      material. This study concerned 24 patients from nine families with a clinical 
      diagnosis of the DM1. DNA extracted from the blood was used for amplification of 
      the triplet repeat sequences at the DMPK loci. We obtained two bands for the 
      normal subjects and one band for patients corresponding to normal DMPK allele, 
      confirmed by the TP-PCR and the Southern blot. This rapid test for initial 
      screening of samples for the presence of DMPK mutations is economical and 
      reliable method. This method reduces the number of samples needing TP-PCR and 
      Southern blotting.

PG  - 481-6
LID - 10.1007/s00401-010-0660-7 [doi]
AB  - Congenital myotonic dystrophy (CDM) is associated with markedly expanded CTG 
      repeats in DMPK. The presence of numerous immature fibers with peripheral halo is 
      a characteristic feature of CDM muscles together with hypotrophy of type 1 
      fibers. Smaller type 1 fibers with no structural abnormality are a definitive 
      criterion of congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD). Nonetheless, we recently 
      came across a patient who was genetically confirmed as CDM, but had been earlier 
      diagnosed as CFTD when he was an infant. In this study, we performed clinical, 
      pathological, and genetic analyses in infantile patients pathologically diagnosed 
      as CFTD to evaluate CDM patients indistinguishable from CFTD. We examined CTG 
      repeat expansion in DMPK in 28 infantile patients pathologically diagnosed as 
      CFTD. Mutation screening of ACTA1 and TPM3 was performed, and we compared 
      clinical and pathological findings of 20 CDM patients with those of the other 
      cohorts. We identified four (14%) patients with CTG expansion in DMPK. ACTA1 
      mutation was identified in four (14%), and TPM3 mutation was found in two (7%) 
      patients. Fiber size disproportion was more prominent in patients with ACTA1 or 
      TPM3 mutations as compared to CFTD patients with CTG expansion. A further three 
      patients among 20 CDM patients showed pathological findings similar to CFTD. From 
      our results, CDM should be excluded in CFTD patients.

TI  - Modification of the triplet repeat primed polymerase chain reaction method for 
      detection of the CTG repeat expansion in myotonic dystrophy type 1: application 
      in preimplantation genetic diagnosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To overcome problems associated with the use of triplet repeat primed 
      polymerase chain reaction (TP-PCR) in preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of 
      myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). DESIGN: Clinical research study. SETTING: UCL 
      Centre for PGD and Centre for Reproductive and Genetic Health. PATIENT(S): Seven 
      couples undergoing PGD for DM1. INTERVENTION(S): A modified TP-PCR protocol 
      (mTP-PCR) for the reliable detection of both expanded and nonexpanded alleles in 
      DMPK was optimized using single lymphocytes. Four cycles of PGD were performed 
      with TP-PCR for diagnosis and a further 10 cycles with mTP-PCR. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE(S): Amplification efficiency, allele dropout, diagnosis rate, and 
      delivery rate. RESULT(S): Preliminary testing showed that the TP-PCR 
      amplification efficiency was higher using lymphocytes versus buccal cells. Single 
      lymphocytes gave very high amplification efficiencies for both protocols (99% to 
      100%). There were no false-positive or false-negative results for 148 single 
      lymphocytes tested with mTP-PCR compared with 9% (5 out of 54) false-positive 
      results with TP-PCR, indicating the improved accuracy of the modified protocol. 
      In embryos, the diagnosis rate was 95.6% with mTP-PCR and 75% with TP-PCR. 
      CONCLUSION(S): For PGD of DM1, mTP-PCR is recommended. It may also be applied as 
      a rapid screen for DMPK expansions in individuals with symptoms of DM1, relatives 
      of known mutation carriers, or in prenatal diagnosis.

TI  - A tail-anchored myotonic dystrophy protein kinase isoform induces perinuclear 
      clustering of mitochondria, autophagy, and apoptosis.
PG  - e8024

LID - e8024
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene and gene 
      products have thus far mainly concentrated on the fate of length mutation in the 
      (CTG)n repeat at the DNA level and consequences of repeat expansion at the RNA 
      level in DM1 patients and disease models. Surprisingly little is known about the 
      function of DMPK protein products. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We demonstrate 
      here that transient expression of one major protein product of the human gene, 
      the hDMPK A isoform with a long tail anchor, results in mitochondrial 
      fragmentation and clustering in the perinuclear region. Clustering occurred in a 
      variety of cell types and was enhanced by an intact tubulin cytoskeleton. In 
      addition to morphomechanical changes, hDMPK A expression induces physiological 
      changes like loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increased autophagy 
      activity, and leakage of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space 
      accompanied by apoptosis. Truncation analysis using YFP-hDMPK A fusion constructs 
      revealed that the protein's tail domain was necessary and sufficient to evoke 
      mitochondrial clustering behavior. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest that 
      the expression level of the DMPK A isoform needs to be tightly controlled in 
      cells where the hDMPK gene is expressed. We speculate that aberrant splice 
      isoform expression might be a codetermining factor in manifestation of specific 
      DM1 features in patients.

AB  - Molecular genetic testing of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is based on the 
      identification and determination of a cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) repeat 
      expansion in the DMPK gene. This is usually done by Southern blot analysis-a 
      time-consuming and very laborious technique requiring high molecular weight DNA. 
      The aim of our study was to develop a highly sensitive, rapid, and cost-effective 
      molecular analysis characterizing the CTG repeat region of the DMPK gene based on 
      a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol. (1) For the detection of 
      alleles of up to 100 repeats, a quantitative fluorescent (QF) amplification with 
      primers flanking the repeat region of the DM1 locus and two reference genes (PAX2 
      and DHCR7) for standardization was used. By this method it was possible to 
      identify both homozygous and heterozygous DM1 alleles. (2) Long PCR was only 
      performed if a single wild-type allele was detected that gave a QF-PCR signal of 
      only half intensity compared to a homozygous sample. The results obtained using 
      combined QF and Long PCR are highly accurate compared with Southern blot 
      analysis. We conclude that our new rapid analysis is reliable for genetic testing 
      of DM1 patients.

TI  - Absence of a differentiation defect in muscle satellite cells from DM2 patients.
PG  - 181-90
LID - 10.1016/j.nbd.2009.07.009 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and type II (DM2) are dominantly inherited 
      multisystemic disorders. DM1 is triggered by the pathological expansion of a 
      (CTG)(n) triplet repeat in the DMPK gene, whereas a (CCTG)(n) tetranucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the ZNF9 gene causes DM2. Both forms of the disease share 
      several features, even though the causative mutations and the loci involved 
      differ. Important distinctions exist, such as the lack of a congenital form of 
      DM2. The reason for these disparities is unknown. In this study, we characterized 
      skeletal muscle satellite cells from adult DM2 patients to provide an in vitro 
      model for the disease. We used muscle cells from DM1 biopsies as a comparison 
      tool. Our main finding is that DM2 satellite cells differentiate normally in 
      vitro. Myotube formation was similar to unaffected controls. In contrast, fetal 
      DM1 cells were deficient in that ability. Consistent with this observation, the 
      myogenic program in DM2 was intact but is compromised in fetal DM1 cells. 
      Although expression of the ZNF9 gene was enhanced in DM2 during differentiation, 
      the levels of the ZNF9 protein were substantially reduced. This suggests that the 
      presence of a large CCTG tract impairs the translation of the ZNF9 mRNA. 
      Additionally, DM2 muscle biopsies displayed the altered splicing of the insulin 
      receptor mRNA, correlating with insulin resistance in the patients. Finally, 
      CUGBP1 steady-state protein levels were unchanged in DM2 cultured muscle cells 
      and in DM2 muscle biopsies relative to controls, whereas they are increased in 
      DM1 muscle cells. Our findings suggest that the myogenic program throughout 
      muscle development and tissue regeneration is intact in DM2.

LID - 10.2174/138920208786847944 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multi-system disorder characterized by 
      muscle wasting, myotonia, cardiac conduction defects, cataracts, and 
      neuropsychological dysfunction. DM1 is caused by expansion of a CTG repeat in the 
      3 untranslated region (UTR) of the Dystrophia Myotonica Protein Kinase (DMPK) 
      gene. A body of work demonstrates that DMPK mRNAs containing abnormally expanded 
      CUG repeats are toxic to several cell types. A core mechanism underlying symptoms 
      of DM1 is that mutant DMPK RNA interferes with the developmentally regulated 
      alternative splicing of defined pre-mRNAs. Expanded CUG repeats fold into ds(CUG) 
      hairpins that sequester nuclear proteins including human Muscleblind-like (MBNL) 
      and hnRNP H alternative splicing factors. DM1 cells activate CELF family member 
      CUG-BP1 protein through hyperphosphorylation and stabilization in the cell 
      nucleus. CUG-BP1 and MBNL1 proteins act antagonistically in exon selection in 
      several pre-mRNA transcripts, thus MBNL1 sequestration and increase in nuclear 
      activity of CUG-BP1 both act synergistically to missplice defined transcripts. 
      Mutant DMPK-mediated effect on subcellular localization, and defective 
      phosphorylation of cytoplasmic CUG-BP1, have additionally been linked to 
      defective translation of p21 and MEF2A in DM1, possibly explaining delayed 
      differentiation of DM1 muscle cells. Mutant DMPK transcripts bind and sequester 
      transcription factors such as Specificity protein 1 leading to reduced 
      transcription of selected genes. Recently, transcripts containing long hairpin 
      structures of CUG repeats have been shown to be a Dicer ribonuclease target and 
      Dicer-induced downregulation of the mutant DMPK transcripts triggers silencing 
      effects on RNAs containing long complementary repeats. In summary, mutant DMPK 
      transcripts alter gene transcription, alternative splicing, and translation of 
      specific gene transcripts, and have the ability to trigger gene-specific 
      silencing effects in DM1 cells. Therapies aimed at reversing these gene 
      expression alterations should prove effective ways to treat DM1.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a genetic disorder linked to a (CTG)(n) repeat 
      expansion in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. Upon transcription in 
      the nucleus, the CUG repeats form a stable RNA stem-loop that sequesters the 
      RNA-binding protein MBNL1 from its normal function in the cell. MBNL1 regulates 
      the alternative splicing of many pre-mRNAs, and upon MBNL1's sequestration, the 
      alternative splicing of many genes is mis-regulated, leading to disease symptoms. 
      MBNL1 is known to bind directly to at least 3 of the pre-mRNAs that it regulates, 
      but how MBNL1 binding mechanistically regulates alternative splicing is unclear. 
      Here, we demonstrate that MBNL1 controls the splicing of exon 5 in the cardiac 
      troponin T (cTNT) pre-mRNA by competing directly with the essential splicing 
      factor U2AF65 for binding at the 3' end of intron 4. When U2AF65 is prevented 
      from binding to the pre-mRNA, the U2 snRNP can no longer be recruited and the 
      following exon is skipped. Furthermore, MBNL1 and U2AF65 appear to compete by 
      binding to mutually exclusive RNA structures. When bound by splicing factors, the 
      3' end of intron 4 can form either a stem-loop or a single-stranded structure. 
      MBNL1 binds a portion of the intron as a stem-loop, whereas U2AF65 binds the same 
      region in a single-strand structure. Mutations that strengthen the stem-loop 
      decrease U2AF65 binding affinity and also repress exon 5 inclusion, independently 
      of MBNL1. Thus, U2AF65 binding can be blocked either by MBNL1 binding or by the 
      stabilization of RNA secondary structure.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the variability at the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase 
      (DMPK) gene in a Chilean sample of healthy people. DM1 is an autosomal dominant 
      disorder caused by an expansion of a (CTG) repeat at the 3'-UTR of the gene DMPK. 
      Healthy individuals have alleles under 35 repeats and diseased individuals have 
      over 50. METHODS: Genotyping the number of (CTG) repeats at this gene in a sample 
      of healthy Chilean people. RESULTS: Allele frequencies were significantly 
      different from those of other populations. The most frequent allele was with five 
      repeats. The frequency of larger alleles (>18 CTG repeats) was 11%, close to the 
      European frequency (12%) and higher than the Japanese (8%) and Aboriginal 
      Pehuenche samples (8%). CONCLUSIONS: Allelic frequencies in the Chilean sample 
      studied were intermediate between those of the two ancestral populations 
      (European and Pehuenche).

PG  - 2353-66
LID - 10.1002/dvdy.21653 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is a multi-systemic disease caused by a triplet 
      nucleotide repeat expansion in the 3' untranslated region of the gene coding for 
      myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK). The primary pathophysiology of DM1 is 
      thought to result from RNA transport and processing defects. The function of DMPK 
      in development or any potential role in DM1 remains unknown. Here we report a 
      novel role for DMPK in myogenesis. We have discovered a specific expression 
      pattern of DMPK in mouse and chick embryonic development. DMPK is expressed in 
      postmitotic cardiac and skeletal myocytes and developmental signaling centers. 
      During cardiac myocyte maturation, DMPK migrates from perinuclear to cellular 
      membrane localization. Manipulating DMPK levels in cultured cardiac and skeletal 
      myocytes has revealed a key role for DMPK in myocyte differentiation. 
      Overexpression of DMPK induces cell rounding and apoptosis in myocytes. In 
      addition, DMPK is necessary for myogenin expression in differentiating C2C12 
      myoblasts.

TI  - The CTG repeat expansion size correlates with the splicing defects observed in 
      muscles from myotonic dystrophy type 1 patients.
PG  - 639-46
LID - 10.1136/jmg.2008.058909 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is caused by an unstable (CTG)n repetition 
      located in the 3'UTR of the DM protein kinase gene (DMPK). Untranslated expanded 
      DMPK transcripts are retained in ribonuclear foci which sequester CUG-binding 
      proteins essential for the maturation of pre-mRNAs. AIM: To investigate the 
      effects of CTG expansion length on three molecular parameters associated with the 
      DM1 muscle pathology: (1) the expression level of the DMPK gene; (2) the degree 
      of splicing misregulation; and (3) the number of ribonuclear foci. METHODS: 
      Splicing analysis of the IR, MBNL1, c-TNT and CLCN1 genes, RNA-FISH experiments 
      and determination of the DMPK expression on muscle samples from DM1 patients with 
      an expansion below 500 repetitions (n = 6), DM1 patients carrying a mutation 
      above 1000 CTGs (n = 6), and from controls (n = 6). RESULTS: The level of 
      aberrant splicing of the IR, MBNL1, c-TNT and CLCN1 genes is different between 
      the two groups of DM1 muscle samples and correlates with the CTG repeat length. 
      RNA-FISH analysis revealed that the number of ribonuclear foci in DM1 muscle 
      sections increases in patients with a higher (CTG)n number. No relationships were 
      found between the expression level of the DMPK gene transcript and average 
      expansion sizes. CONCLUSION: The CTG repeat length plays a key role in the extent 
      of splicing misregulation and foci formation, thus providing a useful link 
      between the genotype and the molecular cellular phenotype in DM1.

PG  - 916-20
LID - 10.1002/mus.21046 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal-dominant multisystemic disorder 
      that may rarely be associated with benign and malignant neoplasms. Cases of both 
      thymoma and myasthenia gravis in association with DM1 are extremely rare. A 
      literature review revealed only three prior reports. We present a 51-year-old man 
      with a family history of DM1 and fluctuating diplopia and ptosis, who was found 
      to have acetylcholine receptor-binding antibodies, thymoma, and a clinical 
      presentation compatible with ocular myasthenia gravis as well as positive genetic 
      testing for DM1. Needle electromyographic (EMG) study demonstrated diffuse runs 
      of myotonic discharges in multiple muscles, consistent with the diagnosis of DM1. 
      Single-fiber EMG showed both increased jitter and blocking. Due to somatic 
      instability, which has been shown previously in DM1, the myotonin protein kinase 
      (DMPK) gene appears to act as a tumor suppressor. Therefore, abnormal CTG repeat 
      expansions in the gene could lead to the development of thymoma and myasthenia 
      gravis.

AB  - We describe a rare case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a 14-year-old female 
      with congenital myotonic dystrophy manifested as mental retardation, extensive 
      contractures of multiple joints of the lower extremities, and severe scoliosis. 
      Because of the potential toxicity of chemotherapy and the patient's poor 
      performance status, a modified chemotherapy regimen was administered. Analysis of 
      the greatly expanded number of CTG repeats at the 3' untranslated region of DMPK 
      gene showed that the number of repeats was 233 greater in leukemic cells than in 
      normal lymphocytes; this elongation may have occurred during the cellular 
      proliferation of leukemic clones.

TI  - The RNA-binding protein CUGBP1 regulates stability of tumor necrosis factor mRNA 
      in muscle cells: implications for myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 22457-63
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M802803200 [doi]
AB  - Type I myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is caused by a triplet repeat expansion in the 
      3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the dystrophia myotonia protein kinase (DMPK) 
      gene. Pathogenesis is closely linked with production of a toxic RNA from the 
      mutant allele, which interferes with function of several RNA-binding proteins, 
      including CUGBP1. Here we show that expression of a mutant DMPK 3'-UTR containing 
      960 CUG repeats is sufficient to increase expression and stability of an mRNA 
      encoding the potent proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF). CUGBP1 
      specifically recognizes sequences within the TNF 3'-UTR that are dissimilar from 
      its canonical UG-rich binding site. Depletion of CUGBP1 from mouse myoblasts 
      results in increased abundance of TNF mRNA through stabilization of the 
      transcript. Moreover, activation of the protein kinase C pathway by treatment 
      with phorbol ester, which has been shown previously to result in CUGBP1 
      phosphorylation, also causes TNF mRNA stabilization. Our results suggest that the 
      elevated serum TNF seen in DM1 patients may be derived from muscle where it is 
      induced by expression of toxic DMPK RNA. Importantly, overexpression of this 
      potent cytokine could contribute to the muscle wasting and insulin resistance 
      that are characteristic of this debilitating disease.

TI  - Aberrantly spliced alpha-dystrobrevin alters alpha-syntrophin binding in myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1.
PG  - 677-85
LID - 10.1212/01.wnl.0000302174.08951.cf [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a multisystemic disorder caused by 
      a CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene. Aberrant messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing 
      of several genes has been reported to explain some of the symptoms in DM1, but 
      the cause of muscle wasting is still unknown. By contrast, many forms of muscular 
      dystrophy are caused by abnormalities of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex 
      (DGC). alpha-Dystrobrevin is a key component of the DGC in striated muscle and 
      plays important roles in maturation and signal transduction by interacting with 
      alpha-syntrophin. The goal of this study was to investigate alternative splicing 
      of alpha-dystrobrevin in DM1 and examine alpha-syntrophin binding of different 
      alpha-dystrobrevin splice isoforms. METHODS: Splicing patterns of 
      alpha-dystrobrevin in DM1 muscle were studied by reverse-transcriptase PCR. 
      Expression of the variant splice isoform was examined by immunoblotting and 
      immunohistochemistry. Alternatively spliced isoforms were expressed in cultured 
      cells to investigate interaction with alpha-syntrophin. alpha-Syntrophin 
      expression was examined by immunoblotting. RESULTS: alpha-Dystrobrevin mRNA 
      including exons 11A and 12 was increased in both skeletal and cardiac muscle of 
      DM1 patients. The aberrantly spliced alpha-dystrobrevin isoform was localized to 
      the sarcolemma, and showed increased binding with alpha-syntrophin. Furthermore, 
      levels of alpha-syntrophin associated with the DGC were increased in DM1 muscle. 
      CONCLUSION: Alternative splicing of alpha-dystrobrevin is dysregulated in 
      myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) muscle, resulting in changes in alpha-syntrophin 
      binding. These results raise the possibility that effects on alpha-dystrobrevin 
      splicing may influence signaling in DM1 muscle cells.

TI  - Autism spectrum conditions in myotonic dystrophy type 1: a study on 57 
      individuals with congenital and childhood forms.
PG  - 918-26
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.30698 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant disorder, caused by an 
      expansion of a CTG triplet repeat in the DMPK gene. The aims of the present study 
      were to classify a cohort of children with DM1, to describe their 
      neuropsychiatric problems and cognitive level, to estimate the size of the CTG 
      expansion, and to correlate the molecular findings with the neuropsychiatric 
      problems. Fifty-seven children and adolescents (26 females; 31 males) with DM1 
      (CTG repeats > 40) were included in the study. The following instruments were 
      used: Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), 5-15, Griffiths Mental 
      Development Scales, and the Wechsler Scales. Based on age at onset and presenting 
      symptoms, the children were divided into four DM1 groups; severe congenital (n = 
      19), mild congenital (n = 18), childhood (n = 18), and classical DM1 (n = 2). 
      Forty-nine percent had an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autistic disorder 
      was the most common diagnosis present in 35% of the subjects. Eighty-six percent 
      of the individuals with DM1 had mental retardation (MR), most of them moderate or 
      severe MR. ASD was significantly correlated with the DM1 form; the more severe 
      the form of DM1, the higher the frequency of ASD. The frequency of ASD increased 
      with increasing CTG repeat expansions. ASD and/or other neuropsychiatric 
      disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Tourette's 
      disorder were found in 54% of the total DM1 group. In conclusion, awareness of 
      ASD comorbidity in DM1 is essential. Further studies are warranted to elucidate 
      the molecular etiology causing neurodevelopmental symptoms such as ASD and MR in 
      DM1.

AB  - Evidence for an RNA gain-of-function toxicity has now been provided for an 
      increasing number of human pathologies. Myotonic dystrophies (DM) belong to a 
      class of RNA-dominant diseases that result from RNA repeat expansion toxicity. 
      Specifically, DM of type 1 (DM1), is caused by an expansion of CUG repeats in the 
      3'UTR of the DMPK protein kinase mRNA, while DM of type 2 (DM2) is linked to an 
      expansion of CCUG repeats in an intron of the ZNF9 transcript (ZNF9 encodes a 
      zinc finger protein). In both pathologies the mutant RNA forms nuclear foci. The 
      mechanisms that underlie the RNA pathogenicity seem to be rather complex and not 
      yet completely understood. Here, we describe Drosophila models that might help 
      unravelling the molecular mechanisms of DM1-associated CUG expansion toxicity. We 
      generated transgenic flies that express inducible repeats of different type (CUG 
      or CAG) and length (16, 240, 480 repeats) and then analyzed transgene 
      localization, RNA expression and toxicity as assessed by induced lethality and 
      eye neurodegeneration. The only line that expressed a toxic RNA has a (CTG)(240) 
      insertion. Moreover our analysis shows that its level of expression cannot 
      account for its toxicity. In this line, (CTG)(240.4), the expansion inserted in 
      the first intron of CG9650, a zinc finger protein encoding gene. Interestingly, 
      CG9650 and (CUG)(240.4) expansion RNAs were found in the same nuclear foci. In 
      conclusion, we suggest that the insertion context is the primary determinant for 
      expansion toxicity in Drosophila models. This finding should contribute to the 
      still open debate on the role of the expansions per se in Drosophila and in human 
      pathogenesis of RNA-dominant diseases.

      muscle insulin action.
PG  - e1134
LID - e1134
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1) is caused by a CTG expansion in the 3'-unstranslated 
      region of the DMPK gene, which encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase. One of 
      the common clinical features of DM1 patients is insulin resistance, which has 
      been associated with a pathogenic effect of the repeat expansions. Here we show 
      that DMPK itself is a positive modulator of insulin action. DMPK-deficient 
      (dmpk-/-) mice exhibit impaired insulin signaling in muscle tissues but not in 
      adipocytes and liver, tissues in which DMPK is not expressed. Dmpk-/- mice 
      display metabolic derangements such as abnormal glucose tolerance, reduced 
      glucose uptake and impaired insulin-dependent GLUT4 trafficking in muscle. Using 
      DMPK mutants, we show that DMPK is required for a correct intracellular 
      trafficking of insulin and IGF-1 receptors, providing a mechanism to explain the 
      molecular and metabolic phenotype of dmpk-/- mice. Taken together, these findings 
      indicate that reduced DMPK expression may directly influence the onset of 
      insulin-resistance in DM1 patients and point to dmpk as a new candidate gene for 
      susceptibility to type 2-diabetes.

TI  - DM1 CTG expansions affect insulin receptor isoforms expression in various tissues 
      of transgenic mice.
PG  - 1183-91
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is a dominant autosomal multisystemic disorder caused by 
      the expansion of an unstable CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3' untranslated 
      region of the DMPK gene. Nuclear accumulation of the enlarged CUG-containing DMPK 
      transcripts has a deleterious effect on the regulation of alternative splicing of 
      some RNAs and has a central role in causing the symptoms of DM1. In particular, 
      Insulin Receptor (IR) mRNA splicing defects have been observed in the muscle of 
      DM1 patients. In this study, we have investigated IR splicing in 
      insulin-responsive tissues (i.e. skeletal muscles, adipose tissue, liver) and 
      pancreas and we have studied glucose metabolism in mice carrying the human 
      genomic DM1 region with expanded (>350 CTG) or normal (20 CTG) repeats and in 
      wild-type mice. Mice carrying DM1 expansions displayed a tissue- and 
      age-dependent abnormal regulation of IR mRNA splicing in all the tissues that we 
      investigated. Furthermore, these mice showed a basal hyperglycemia and glucose 
      intolerance which disappeared with age. Our findings show that deregulation of IR 
      splicing due to the DM1 mutation can occur in different mouse tissues, suggesting 
      that CTG repeat expansions might also result in IR misplicing not only in muscles 
      but also in other tissues in DM1 patients.

TI  - DMPK-associated myotonic dystrophy and CTG repeats in Alabama African Americans.
PG  - 448-53
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a result of a CTG expansion in the 
      3'-untranslated region of the DMPK gene. DM1 is rare among African blacks who 
      have fewer large CTG repeats in the normal range than other racial/ethnic groups. 
      Neither the prevalence of DM1 nor the relationship of CTG expansion to clinical 
      status in African Americans (AAs) is well documented. We describe two AA brothers 
      with DM1, each of whom had CTG repeats of 5/639; their father was reported to 
      have DM1 and had CTG repeats of 5/60. Other family members had CTG repeats of 
      5-14. An unrelated AA patient from a second kinship also had DM1; an analysis 
      revealed CTG repeats of 27/191. In 161 Alabama AA control subjects, we observed 
      18 CTG alleles from 5 to 28 repeats; the most common allele had five CTG repeats. 
      The frequency of CTG repeats >or=15 were greater (p < 0.0003) in Pygmy, Amhara 
      Ethiopian, Ashkenazi Jewish, North African Jewish, Israeli Muslim Arab, European 
      white, and Japanese populations than in the Alabama AA population. These data 
      suggest that the risk for DM1 in AAs is intermediate between that of African 
      blacks and whites of European descent.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms responsible for aberrant splicing of SERCA1 in myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1.
PG  - 2834-43
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder 
      associated with an expansion of CTG trinucleotide repeats in the 3'-untranslated 
      region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene. The RNA 
      gain-of-function hypothesis proposes that mutant DMPK mRNA alters the function 
      and localization of alternative splicing regulators, which are critical for 
      normal RNA processing. Previously, we found alternative splicing variants of 
      sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase 1 (SERCA1), which excluded exon 
      22, in skeletal muscle of DM1 patients. In the present study, we analyzed the 
      molecular mechanisms responsible for the splicing dysregulation of SERCA1. Five 
      'YGCU(U/G)Y' motifs that could potentially serve as Muscleblind-like 1, 
      (MBNL1)-binding motifs, are included downstream from the SERCA1 exon 22. Exon 
      trapping experiments showed that MBNL1 acts on the 'YGCU(U/G)Y' motif, and 
      positively regulates exon 22 splicing. Of the five MBNL1 motifs in intron 22, the 
      second and third sites were important for regulation of exon 22 splicing, but the 
      other three binding sites were not required. Overexpression of the CUG repeat 
      expansion of DMPK mRNA resulted in exclusion of exon 22 of SERCA1. These results 
      suggest that sequestration of MBNL1 into the CUG repeat expansion of DMPK mRNA 
      could cause the exclusion of SERCA1 exon 22, and the expression of this aberrant 
      splicing form of SERCA1 could affect the regulation of Ca(2+) concentration of 
      sarcoplasmic reticulum in DM patients.

TI  - Altered mRNA splicing of dystrophin in type 1 myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 251-7
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type1 (DM1) is a multisystemic disorder caused by a CTG repeat 
      expansion in the DMPK gene. Aberrant mRNA splicing of several genes has been 
      reported to contribute to some of the symptoms, including myotonia and insulin 
      resistance, but the cause of muscle wasting is unknown. Dystrophin is a 
      cytoskeletal protein that is required for structural stability and signaling at 
      the sarcolemma and has several spliced isoforms. We investigated the alternative 
      splicing of dystrophin in skeletal and cardiac muscle of DM1 patients by using 
      reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and found that dystrophin 
      isoforms lacking exon 71 or 78, which is suggested to encode an important region 
      for protein binding and hydrophobicity, were significantly increased. We suggest 
      that the aberrantly spliced dystrophin is responsible for the muscle wasting in 
      DM1.

TI  - Muscle chloride channel dysfunction in two mouse models of myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 79-94
AB  - Muscle degeneration and myotonia are clinical hallmarks of myotonic dystrophy 
      type 1 (DM1), a multisystemic disorder caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3' 
      untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene. 
      Transgenic mice engineered to express mRNA with expanded (CUG)(250) repeats 
      (HSA(LR) mice) exhibit prominent myotonia and altered splicing of muscle chloride 
      channel gene (Clcn1) transcripts. We used whole-cell patch clamp recordings and 
      nonstationary noise analysis to compare and biophysically characterize the 
      magnitude, kinetics, voltage dependence, and single channel properties of the 
      skeletal muscle chloride channel (ClC-1) in individual flexor digitorum brevis 
      (FDB) muscle fibers isolated from 1-3-wk-old wild-type and HSA(LR) mice. The 
      results indicate that peak ClC-1 current density at -140 mV is reduced >70% 
      (-48.5 +/- 3.6 and -14.0 +/- 1.6 pA/pF, respectively) and the kinetics of channel 
      deactivation increased in FDB fibers obtained from 18-20- d-old HSA(LR) mice. 
      Nonstationary noise analysis revealed that the reduction in ClC-1 current density 
      in HSA(LR) FDB fibers results from a large reduction in ClC-1 channel density 
      (170 +/- 21 and 58 +/- 11 channels/pF in control and HSA(LR) fibers, 
      respectively) and a modest decrease in maximal channel open probability(0.91 +/- 
      0.01 and 0.75 +/- 0.03, respectively). Qualitatively similar results were 
      observed for ClC-1 channel activity in knockout mice for muscleblind-like 1 
      (Mbnl1(DeltaE3/DeltaE3)), a second murine model of DM1 that exhibits prominent 
      myotonia and altered Clcn1 splicing (Kanadia et al., 2003). These results support 
      a molecular mechanism for myotonia in DM1 in which a reduction in both the number 
      of functional sarcolemmal ClC-1 and maximal channel open probability, as well as 
      an acceleration in the kinetics of channel deactivation, results from CUG 
      repeat-containing mRNA molecules sequestering Mbnl1 proteins required for proper 
      CLCN1 pre-mRNA splicing and chloride channel function.

AB  - Expansion of CTG repeat within the 3'-untranslated region of the DMPK gene causes 
      the most common neuromuscular disorder, myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), through 
      a RNA trans-dominant mechanism. Here, we explore Caenorhabditis elegans as a 
      model system to investigate the repeat size-dependent toxic effect by expression 
      of green fluorescent protein (GFP) transcripts with various lengths of 
      untranslatable CUG repeats (CUG5, CUG30, CUG83, CUG125, and CUG213) in body wall 
      muscles. CUG213 animals died during embryogenesis or showed retarded growth at 
      larval stages due to defective muscle development. CUG125 animals, although can 
      produce offspring, exhibited uncoordinated muscle function, deviated 
      electropharyngeogram, and an age-dependent abnormality in muscle structure. Most 
      CUG83 animals had normal muscle structure and function as those expressing 30 and 
      shorter repeats. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the in vivo 
      toxicity of CUG repeats is repeat length- and growth-regulated and suggest that 
      expanded CUG repeats are sufficient to cause congenital-like phenotypes in living 
      organisms.

TI  - Clinical case report atypical myopathy in a young girl with 91 CTG repeats in DM1 
      locus and a positive DM1 family history.
PG  - 1509-18
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant inheritable disease 
      associated with an expansion of CTG repeats in the 3' UTR of the DMPK gene. The 
      subject is an 11-year-old girl with atypical myopathy. Because the proband's 
      family has a positive DM1 history, a molecular-genetic analysis for DM1 was 
      performed. This study showed that proband had a small DMPK expansion (91 CTG 
      repeats) although the observed myopathy would not normally be associated with 
      DM1. These results show how the phenotypic manifestation of DM1 can have unusual 
      symptoms with a completely unexpected relationship to genotype.

TI  - Polymorphic CUG repeats in human mRNAs and their effects on gene expression.
PG  - 149-56
AB  - Expanded CUG repeats in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the gene encoding 
      myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) cause myotonic dystrophy type 1 disease 
      (DM1). The presence of such repeats has been found to impede gene expression at 
      several levels in model systems. We took a bioinformatic approach to survey all 
      human mRNA sequences for polymorphic CUG repeats. Our survey revealed that CUG 
      repeats occur widely in various regions of mRNAs, with higher frequency in 
      protein coding regions than 5'-UTRs or 3'-UTRs. About 30 genes were found to 
      contain CUG repeats that are polymorphic in the number of repeats, suggesting the 
      potential to expand or shrink. However, long polymorphic repeats were restricted 
      to the 3'-UTR of the DMPK gene and the coding region of the ribosomal protein L14 
      gene. Using cell-free translation systems, we showed that extended CUG repeats 
      can inhibit protein synthesis in vitro in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate, but not 
      in wheat germ extracts, consistent with our previous finding of an interaction of 
      CUG repeats with the protein kinase PKR. In transfected cells, CUG repeats can 
      inhibit gene expression both in cis and in trans. However, observations with 
      PKR-minus cells indicate that these effects are not primarily attributable to the 
      interaction of extended CUG repeats with PKR. Northwestern blotting detected the 
      presence in human cells of more CUG-binding proteins than are currently known.

TI  - Fen1 does not control somatic hypermutability of the (CTG)(n)*(CAG)(n) repeat in 
      a knock-in mouse model for DM1.
PG  - 5208-14
AB  - The mechanism of trinucleotide repeat expansion, an important cause of 
      neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases, is poorly understood. We report 
      here on the study of the role of flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1), a structure-specific 
      nuclease with both 5' flap endonuclease and 5'-3' exonuclease activity, in the 
      somatic hypermutability of the (CTG)(n)*(CAG)(n) repeat of the DMPK gene in a 
      mouse model for myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). By intercrossing mice with Fen1 
      deficiency with transgenics with a DM1 (CTG)(n)*(CAG)(n) repeat (where 104n110), 
      we demonstrate that Fen1 is not essential for faithful maintenance of this repeat 
      in early embryonic cleavage divisions until the blastocyst stage. Additionally, 
      we found that the frequency of somatic DM1 (CTG)(n)*(CAG)(n) repeat instability 
      was essentially unaltered in mice with Fen1 haploinsufficiency up to 1.5 years of 
      age. Based on these findings, we propose that Fen1, despite its role in DNA 
      repair and replication, is not primarily involved in maintaining stability at the 
      DM1 locus.

TI  - Flies deficient in Muscleblind protein model features of myotonic dystrophy with 
      altered splice forms of Z-band associated transcripts.
PG  - 487-99
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a dominantly inherited neuromuscular disorder 
      characterised by muscle weakness and wasting. There are two forms of DM; both of 
      which are caused by the expansion of repeated DNA sequences. DM1 is associated 
      with a CTG repeat located in the 3' untranslated region of a gene, DMPK and DM2 
      with a tetranucleotide repeat expansion, CCTG, located in the first intron of a 
      different gene, ZNF9. Recent data suggest a dominant RNA gain-of-function 
      mechanism underlying DM, as transcripts containing either CUG or CCUG repeat 
      expansions accumulate as foci in the nuclei of DM1 and DM2 cells respectively, 
      where they exert a toxic effect, sequestering specific RNA binding proteins such 
      as Muscleblind, which leads to splicing defects and the disruption of normal 
      cellular functions. Z-band disruption is a well-known histological feature of DM1 
      muscle, which has also been reported in Muscleblind deficient flies. In order to 
      determine whether there is a common molecular basis for this abnormality we have 
      examined the alternative splicing pattern of transcripts that encode proteins 
      associated with the Z-band in both organisms. Our results demonstrate that the 
      missplicing of ZASP/LDB3 leads to the expression of an isoform in DM1 patient 
      muscle, which is not present in normal controls, nor in other myopathies. 
      Furthermore the Drosophila homologue, CG30084, is also misspliced, in Muscleblind 
      deficient flies. Another Z-band transcript, alpha actinin, is misspliced in mbl 
      mutant flies, but not in DM1 patient samples. These results point to similarities 
      but subtle differences in the molecular breakdown of Z-band structures in flies 
      and DM patients and emphasise the relevance of Muscleblind proteins in DM 
      pathophysiology.

TI  - Instability in the transmission of the myotonic dystrophy CTG repeat in human 
      oocytes and preimplantation embryos.
PG  - 98-105
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the timing and variability of CTG repeat expansion within 
      the human dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene in early development. 
      DESIGN: Triplet-primed polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the expanded 
      CTG repeat in oocytes and embryos obtained from myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1) 
      patients, and a heminested polymerase chain reaction approach was used to amplify 
      the normal CTG repeats in supernumerary IVF embryos. SETTING: University hospital 
      laboratory. PATIENT(S): Two DM1-affected females undergoing preimplantation 
      genetic diagnosis who carried different CTG repeats. Also, 61 IVF patients who 
      carried a (CTG)(5-18) and (CTG)(19-37) normal DMPK repeat. INTERVENTION(S): None. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The degree of expansion of the repeat in the oocytes and 
      embryos compared with the DM1-affected maternal repeat and the size of the 
      (CTG)(19-37) repeat compared with the parental size in IVF embryos. RESULT(S): 
      The degree of repeat expansion was greater than the DM1 maternal lymphocyte for 
      two of four oocytes, including a germinal vesicle-stage oocyte and 17 of 20 
      three-cell to blastocyst stage embryos. A change in the (CTG)(19-37) repeat was 
      seen in 7 (7%) of 95 paternal transmissions but in no maternal transmissions. 
      CONCLUSION(S): Because the repeat was already expanded in the immature oocyte, 
      the initial expansion most likely occurs during oogenesis. A variable degree of 
      DMPK(CTG)(n) expansion in the embryo is seen from different mothers. In addition, 
      instability in paternal transmission of normal-range (CTG)(19-37) repeats occurs 
      at the level of the embryo.

TI  - DM2 intronic expansions: evidence for CCUG accumulation without flanking sequence 
      or effects on ZNF9 mRNA processing or protein expression.
PG  - 1808-15
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is caused by a CCTG expansion mutation in intron 
      1 of the zinc finger protein 9 (ZNF9) gene. The mean expansion size in patients 
      is larger than for DM1 or any previously reported disorder (mean=5000 CCTGs; 
      range=75-11 000), and similar to DM1, repeats containing ribonuclear inclusions 
      accumulate in affected DM2 tissue. Although an RNA gain-of-function mechanism 
      involving DM1 CUG or DM2 CCUG expansion transcripts is now well established, 
      still debated are the potential role that flanking sequences within the DMPK 
      3'-UTR may have on disease pathogenesis and whether or not decreased expression 
      of DMPK, ZNF9 or neighboring genes at these loci contribute to disease. To 
      address these questions in DM2, we have examined the nucleic acid content of the 
      ribonuclear inclusions and the effects of these large expansions on ZNF9 
      expression. Using cell lines either haploid or homozygous for the expansion, as 
      well as skeletal muscle biopsy tissue, we demonstrate that pre-mRNAs containing 
      large CCUG expansions are normally spliced and exported from the nucleus, that 
      the expansions do not decrease ZNF9 expression at the mRNA or protein level, and 
      that the ribonuclear inclusions are enriched for the CCUG expansion, but not 
      intronic flanking sequences. These data suggest that the downstream molecular 
      effects of the DM2 mutation are triggered by the accumulation of CCUG repeat 
      tract alone.

TI  - Double trouble in hereditary neuropathy: concomitant mutations in the PMP-22 gene 
      and another gene produce novel phenotypes.
PG  - 112-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mutations in the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP-22) gene are the 
      most common cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy and may rarely occur in 
      combination with other neurogenetic diseases. OBJECTIVE: To characterize 3 
      families having a mutation in PMP-22 in addition to another neurogenetic disease 
      mutation. DESIGN: Clinical, electrophysiologic, and genetic evaluations were made 
      of 3 families with more than 1 genetic neuromuscular disease. SETTING AND 
      PATIENTS: Family members were evaluated in neurogenetic and muscular dystrophy 
      clinics in a university medical center setting. RESULTS: Three unusual families 
      were found: (1) 2 young brothers each having a PMP-22 duplication and a missense 
      mutation in the GJB1 (Connexin-32) gene; (2) a 32-year-old woman having a PMP-22 
      duplication and a 1000-fold CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene (DM1 myotonic 
      dystrophy); and (3) a 39-year-old man with a PMP-22 deletion and a missense 
      mutation in the ABCD1 gene (adrenomyeloneuropathy). The mutations were 
      "additive," causing a more severe phenotype than expected with each individual 
      disease and coinciding with the important impact of each gene on peripheral nerve 
      function. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals having 2 separate mutations in neuromuscular 
      disease-related genes may develop unusually severe phenotypes. Neurologists 
      should be alert to this possibility.

TI  - Effect of the [CCTG]n repeat expansion on ZNF9 expression in myotonic dystrophy 
      type II (DM2).
PG  - 329-34
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy is caused by two different mutations: a (CTG)n expansion in 3' 
      UTR region of the DMPK gene (DM1) and a (CCTG)n expansion in intron 1 of the ZNF9 
      gene (DM2). The most accredited mechanism for DM pathogenesis is an RNA 
      gain-of-function. Other findings suggest a contributory role of 
      DMPK-insufficiency in DM1. To address the issue of ZNF9 role in DM2, we have 
      analyzed the effects of (CCTG)n expansion on ZNF9 expression in lymphoblastoid 
      cell lines (n=4) from DM2 patients. We did not observe any significant alteration 
      in ZNF9 mRNA and protein levels, as shown by QRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. 
      Additional RT-PCR experiments demonstrated that ZNF9 pre-mRNA splicing pattern, 
      which includes two isoforms, is unmodified in DM2 cells. Our results indicate 
      that the (CCTG)n expansion in the ZNF9 intron does not appear to have a direct 
      consequence on the expression of the gene itself.

TI  - Decreased expression of DMPK: correlation with CTG repeat expansion and fibre 
      type composition in myotonic dystrophy type 1.
PG  - 235-42
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a 
      trinucleotide repeat-expansion, cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG)n, in the 3' 
      untranslated region of a gene encoding the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase 
      (DMPK). To correlate CTG expansion and protein expression, we studied muscle 
      specimens from 16 adult DM1 patients using three anti-DMPK antibodies for 
      immunoblotting. We estimated the amount of the full-length DMPK (85 kDa) in 
      muscle biopsies from normal controls and from DM1 patients carrying different 
      (CTG)n expansions. We found that DMPK concentration was decreased to about 50% in 
      DM patients' muscles; the protein decrease did not seem correlated with the CTG 
      repeat length. However, the fibre type composition in skeletal muscle seemed 
      somehow to affect DMPK decrease, as the lowest level of the enzyme was found in 
      patients with the lowest content of type 1 fibre.

TI  - HnRNP H inhibits nuclear export of mRNA containing expanded CUG repeats and a 
      distal branch point sequence.
PG  - 3866-74
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder 
      associated with a (CUG)n expansion in the 3'-untranslated region of the DMPK (DM1 
      protein kinase) gene. Mutant DMPK mRNAs containing the trinucleotide expansion 
      are retained in the nucleus of DM1 cells and form discrete foci. The nuclear 
      sequestration of RNA binding proteins and associated factors binding to the CUG 
      expansions is believed to be responsible for several of the splicing defects 
      observed in DM1 patients and could ultimately be linked to DM1 muscular 
      pathogenesis. Several RNA binding proteins capable of co-localizing with the 
      nuclear-retained mutant DMPK mRNAs have already been identified but none can 
      account for the nuclear retention of the mutant transcripts. Here, we have 
      employed a modified UV crosslinking assay to isolate proteins bound to mutant 
      DMPK-derived RNA and have identified hnRNP H as an abundant candidate. The 
      specific binding of hnRNP H requires not only a CUG repeat expansion but also a 
      splicing branch point distal to the repeats. Suppression of hnRNP H expression by 
      RNAi rescued nuclear retention of RNA with CUG repeat expansions. The 
      identification of hnRNP H as a factor capable of binding and possibly modulating 
      nuclear retention of mutant DMPK mRNA may prove to be an important link in our 
      understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to DM1 pathogenesis.

TI  - Altered mRNA splicing of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor and 
      sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase in myotonic dystrophy type 1.
PG  - 2189-200
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a debilitating multisystemic disorder caused 
      by a CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene. Aberrant splicing of several genes 
      has been reported to contribute to some symptoms of DM1, but the cause of muscle 
      weakness in DM1 and elevated Ca2+ concentrations in cultured DM muscle cells is 
      unknown. Here, we investigated the alternative splicing of mRNAs of two major 
      proteins of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) and 
      sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) 1 or 2. The fetal 
      variants, ASI(-) of RyR1 which lacks residue 3481-3485, and SERCA1b which differs 
      at the C-terminal were significantly increased in skeletal muscles from DM1 
      patients and the transgenic mouse model of DM1 (HSA(LR)). In addition, a novel 
      variant of SERCA2 was significantly decreased in DM1 patients. The total amount 
      of mRNA for RyR1, SERCA1 and SERCA2 in DM1 and the expression levels of their 
      proteins in HSA(LR) mice were not significantly different. However, heterologous 
      expression of ASI(-) in cultured cells showed decreased affinity for 
      [3H]ryanodine but similar Ca2+ dependency, and decreased channel activity in 
      single-channel recording when compared with wild-type (WT) RyR1. In support of 
      this, RyR1-knockout myotubes expressing ASI(-) exhibited a decreased incidence of 
      Ca2+ oscillations during caffeine exposure compared with that observed for 
      myotubes expressing WT-RyR1. We suggest that aberrant splicing of RyR1 and SERCA1 
      mRNAs might contribute to impaired Ca2+ homeostasis in DM1 muscle.

TI  - Colocalization of muscleblind with RNA foci is separable from mis-regulation of 
      alternative splicing in myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 2923-33
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1), which is caused by a non-coding CTG-repeat 
      expansion in the dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase (DMPK) gene, is an 
      RNA-mediated disease. Expanded CUG repeats in transcripts of mutant DMPK form 
      nuclear foci that recruit muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins, a family of 
      alternative splicing factors. Although transcripts of mutant DMPK and MBNL 
      proteins accumulate in nuclear RNA foci, it is not clear whether foci formation 
      is required for splicing mis-regulation. Here, we use a co-transfection strategy 
      to show that both CUG and CAG repeats form RNA foci that colocalize with green 
      fluorescent protein (GFP)-MBNL1 and endogenous MBNL1. However, only CUG repeats 
      alter splicing of the two tested pre-mRNAs, cardiac troponin T (cTNT) and insulin 
      receptor (IR). Using FRAP, we demonstrate that GFP-MBNL1 in CUG and CAG foci have 
      similar half-times of recovery and fractions of immobile molecules, suggesting 
      that GFP-MBNL1 is bound by both CUG and CAG repeats. We also find an immobile 
      fraction of GFP-MBNL1 in DM1 fibroblasts and a similar rapid exchange in 
      endogenous CUG RNA foci. Therefore, formation of RNA foci and disruption of 
      MBNL1-regulated splicing are separable events.

TI  - Re-entry circuit in ventricular tachycardia due to focal fatty-fibrosis in a 
      patient with myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 129-35
AB  - A 69-year-old man with a recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) was admitted. The 
      patient was diagnosed as myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and DNA analysis 
      revealed 1,800 CTG-repeat expansion in the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase 
      (DMPK) gene. Ultrasonic cardiogram (UCG), left ventriculogram (LVG) and magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) did not show any abnormal sign including fatty 
      infiltration. But, endomyocardial biopsy obtained from ventricular outflow tract 
      revealed severe fatty infiltration and interstitial fibrosis. Radiofrequency 
      catheter ablation at the biopsy site could eliminate VT, so it was strongly 
      suggested that the re-entry circuit was formed by focal fatty-fibrosis. Careful 
      observation should be continued for a long period.

TI  - Divergent mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum association of DMPK splice 
      isoforms depends on unique sequence arrangements in tail anchors.
PG  - 1402-14
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) is a Ser/Thr-type protein kinase with 
      unknown function, originally identified as the product of the gene that is 
      mutated by triplet repeat expansion in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 
      (DM1). Alternative splicing of DMPK transcripts results in multiple protein 
      isoforms carrying distinct C termini. Here, we demonstrate by expressing 
      individual DMPKs in various cell types, including C(2)C(12) and DMPK(-/-) 
      myoblast cells, that unique sequence arrangements in these tails control the 
      specificity of anchoring into intracellular membranes. Mouse DMPK A and C were 
      found to associate specifically with either the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the 
      mitochondrial outer membrane, whereas the corresponding human DMPK A and C 
      proteins both localized to mitochondria. Expression of mouse and human DMPK A-but 
      not C-isoforms in mammalian cells caused clustering of ER or mitochondria. 
      Membrane association of DMPK isoforms was resistant to alkaline conditions, and 
      mutagenesis analysis showed that proper anchoring was differentially dependent on 
      basic residues flanking putative transmembrane domains, demonstrating that DMPK 
      tails form unique tail anchors. This work identifies DMPK as the first kinase in 
      the class of tail-anchored proteins, with a possible role in organelle 
      distribution and dynamics.

TI  - Chemotherapeutic deletion of CTG repeats in lymphoblast cells from DM1 patients.
PG  - 6334-46
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by the expansion of a (CTG).(CAG) 
      repeat in the DMPK gene on chromosome 19q13.3. At least 17 neurological diseases 
      have similar genetic mutations, the expansion of DNA repeats. In most of these 
      disorders, the disease severity is related to the length of the repeat expansion, 
      and in DM1 the expanded repeat undergoes further elongation in somatic and 
      germline tissues. At present, in this class of diseases, no therapeutic approach 
      exists to prevent or slow the repeat expansion and thereby reduce disease 
      severity or delay disease onset. We present initial results testing the 
      hypothesis that repeat deletion may be mediated by various chemotherapeutic 
      agents. Three lymphoblast cell lines derived from two DM1 patients treated with 
      either ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS), mitomycin C, mitoxantrone or doxorubicin, at 
      therapeutic concentrations, accumulated deletions following treatment. Treatment 
      with EMS frequently prevented the repeat expansion observed during growth in 
      culture. A significant reduction of CTG repeat length by 100-350 (CTG).(CAG) 
      repeats often occurred in the cell population following treatment with these 
      drugs. Potential mechanisms of drug-induced deletion are presented.

TI  - The myotonic dystrophy type 1 triplet repeat sequence induces gross deletions and 
      inversions.
PG  - 941-52
AB  - The capacity of (CTG.CAG)n and (GAA.TTC)n repeat tracts in plasmids to induce 
      mutations in DNA flanking regions was evaluated in Escherichia coli. Long repeats 
      of these sequences are involved in the etiology of myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 
      Friedreich's ataxia, respectively. Long (CTG.CAG)n (where n = 98 and 175) caused 
      the deletion of most, or all, of the repeats and the flanking GFP gene. Deletions 
      of 0.6-1.8 kbp were found as well as inversions. Shorter repeat tracts (where n = 
      0 or 17) were essentially inert, as observed for the (GAA.TTC)176-containing 
      plasmid. The orientation of the triplet repeat sequence (TRS) relative to the 
      unidirectional origin of replication had a pronounced effect, signaling the 
      participation of replication and/or repair systems. Also, when the TRS was 
      transcribed, the level of deletions was greatly elevated. Under certain 
      conditions, 30-50% of the products contained gross deletions. DNA sequence 
      analyses of the breakpoint junctions in 47 deletions revealed the presence of 
      1-8-bp direct or inverted homologies in all cases. Also, the presence of non-B 
      folded conformations (i.e. slipped structures, cruciforms, or triplexes) at or 
      near the breakpoints was predicted in all cases. This genetic behavior, which was 
      previously unrecognized for a TRS, may provide the basis for a new type of 
      instability of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene in patients with 
      a full mutation.

TI  - (CTG)n expansion at DMPK locus seen only in muscle tissue: a novel case.
PG  - 937-40
AB  - Triplet repeat expansion in 3 untranslated region of myotonic dystrophy protein 
      kinase (DMPK) gene has been implicated as causative in myotonic dystrophy (DM). 
      In cases of DM, high levels of somatic instability have been reported, in which 
      inter-tissue repeat length differences as large as 3000 repeats have been 
      observed. This study highlights the inter-tissue (CTG)n expansion variability at 
      the DMPK locus. Molecular analysis of DMPK gene, encompassing the triplet repeat 
      expansion, was carried out in 31 individuals (11 clinically identified DM 
      patients, 20 controls). All controls showed a 2.1kb band (upto 35 CTG repeats), 
      while four cases exhibited an expansion (>50 repeats). A novel observation was 
      made in one case, wherein the DNA from lymphocytes showed a normal 2.1kb band 
      while the muscle tissue DNA from the same patient was heterozygous for normal and 
      4.3 kb band (>700 repeats). Our results suggested that because inter-tissue 
      variability existed in the (CTG)n repeat number at DMPK locus, an attempt should 
      be made to evaluate affected tissue along with blood wherever possible prior to 
      making a final diagnosis. This is important not only for diagnosis and prenatal 
      analysis, but also while providing genetic counseling to families.

TI  - Genome-wide demethylation destabilizes CTG.CAG trinucleotide repeats in mammalian 
      cells.
PG  - 2979-89
AB  - Many neurological diseases, including myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease 
      and several spinocerebellar ataxias, result from intergenerational increases in 
      the length of a CTG.CAG repeat tract. Although the basis for intergenerational 
      repeat expansion is unclear, repeat tracts are especially unstable during 
      germline development and production of gametes. Mammalian development is 
      characterized by waves of genome-wide demethylation and remethylation. To test 
      whether changes in methylation status might contribute to trinucleotide repeat 
      instability, we examined the effects of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors on 
      trinucleotide repeat stability in mammalian cells. Using a selectable genetic 
      system for detection of repeat contractions in CHO cells, we showed that the rate 
      of contractions increased >1000-fold upon treatment with the DNA 
      methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR). The link between DNA 
      demethylation and repeat instability was strengthened by similar results obtained 
      with hydralazine treatment, which inhibits expression of DNA methyltransferase. 
      In human cells from myotonic dystrophy patients, treatment with 5-aza-CdR 
      strongly destabilized repeat tracts in the DMPK gene, with a clear bias toward 
      expansion. The bias toward expansion events and changes in repeat length that 
      occur in jumps, rather than by accumulation of small changes, are reminiscent of 
      the intergenerational repeat instability observed in human patients. The dramatic 
      destabilizing effect of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors supports the hypothesis 
      that changes in methylation patterns during epigenetic reprogramming may trigger 
      the intergenerational repeat expansions that lead to disease.

TI  - In situ hybridization analysis of Dmpk mRNA in adult mouse tissues.
PG  - 497-506
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant, multi-system disorder 
      resulting from a CTG repeat expansion located in the 3' untranslated region of 
      DMPK and immediately in the 5' of SIX5. Skeletal muscle, heart and smooth muscle 
      are prominently affected in DM1. Endocrine abnormalities, gonadal atrophy, brain, 
      skin, skeletal, immune and respiratory defects are also features of the disorder. 
      Both DMPK and SIX5 levels are decreased in DM1 patients. Importantly, expression 
      of mutant mRNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats has been shown to alter the 
      activity of CUG repeat binding proteins in DM1. Mouse models have demonstrated 
      that decreased levels of Dmpk, Six5 and the expression of expanded CUG repeats 
      independently contribute to the development of DM1 pathology. However, an 
      important gap in these studies is a lack of clear understanding of the expression 
      pattern of Dmpk. We demonstrate that Dmpk mRNA is expressed in a range of adult 
      mouse tissues that show pathology in DM1 including skeletal muscle, heart, smooth 
      muscle, bone, testis, pituitary, brain, eye, skin, thymus and lung. Thus DMPK 
      loss or CUG repeat expansion could contribute to DM1 pathology to these tissues. 
      Dmpk mRNA is not detected in the ovary, pancreas or kidney. Significantly, Dmpk 
      mRNA is expressed in the intestinal epithelium, cartilage and liver, which have 
      not been reported to show consistent abnormalities in Dmpk(-/-) mice or in 
      transgenic animals expressing CUG repeats. Taken together these data suggest that 
      Dmpk loss or CUG repeat expression per se may not be sufficient to initiate 
      pathology and are consistent with the hypothesis that coexpression of specific 
      CUG repeat binding proteins with the mutant Dmpk mRNA or deregulation of genes 
      such as Six5 that flank the CTG repeat tract may be necessary for DM1 to 
      manifest.

TI  - A non-DM1, non-DM2 multisystem myotonic disorder with frontotemporal dementia: 
      phenotype and suggestive mapping of the DM3 locus to chromosome 15q21-24.
PG  - 1979-92
AB  - The majority of proximal myotonic myopathy syndromes reported so far have been 
      related to the myotonic dystrophy (DM) type 2 (DM2) mutation, an expanded (CCTG)n 
      repeat in the ZNF9 gene. Here, we describe the phenotype and the histological 
      features in muscle and brain of the first large pedigree with a non-myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1 (DM1) non-DM2 multisystem myotonic disorder associated with 
      severe frontotemporal dementia. Thirty individuals from three generations 
      underwent detailed neurological, neuropsychological, electrophysiological, brain 
      imaging and molecular analyses. Ten of them had proximal muscle weakness at 
      onset, clinical/electrical myotonia and DM-type cataracts. The mean age at onset 
      was 46.7 +/- 12.6 years (range: 32-69). Dementia was observed later in the course 
      of the disease. On muscle biopsies, rare nuclear clumps, rimmed vacuoles and 
      small angulated type 1 and type 2 fibres were seen early in the disease. They 
      were replaced by fibrous adipose tissue at later stages. Immunohistochemical 
      analysis of myosin heavy chain isoforms showed no selective fibre type 
      atrophy-both type 1 and type 2 fibres being affected. Cortical atrophy without 
      white matter lesions was seen on brain MRI. A brain single photon emission 
      computed tomography (SPECT) study revealed marked frontotemporal hypoperfusion. 
      Post-mortem examination of the brains of two patients showing prominent 
      frontotemporal spongiosis, neuronal loss and rare neuronal and glial tau 
      inclusions suggested frontotemporal dementia. Western blot analyses of the tau 
      protein showed a triplet of isoforms (60, 64 and 69 kDa) in neocortical areas, 
      and a doublet (64 and 69 kDa) in subcortical areas that distinguish our myotonic 
      disorder from other's myotonic dystrophies. Molecular analyses failed to detect a 
      repeat expansion in the DMPK and ZNF9 genes excluding both DM1 and DM2, whereas a 
      genome-wide linkage analysis strongly suggested a linkage to chromosome 15q21-24. 
      This previously unreported multisystem myotonic disorder including findings 
      resembling DM1, DM2 and frontotemporal dementia provides further evidence of the 
      clinical and genetic heterogeneity of the myotonic dystrophies. We propose to 
      designate this disease myotonic dystrophy type 3, DM3.

TI  - Insulin receptor splicing alteration in myotonic dystrophy type 2.
PG  - 1309-13
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by either an untranslated CTG expansion in the 
      3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene on chromosome 19 (dystrophia myotonica 
      type 1 [DM1]), or an untranslated CCTG tetranucleotide repeat expansion in intron 
      1 of the ZNF9 gene on chromosome 3 (dystrophia myotonica type 2 [DM2]). 
      RNA-binding proteins adhere to transcripts of the repeat expansions that 
      accumulate in the nucleus, and a trans-dominant dysregulation of pre-mRNA 
      alternative splicing has been demonstrated for several genes. In muscle from 
      patients with DM1, altered insulin-receptor splicing to the nonmuscle isoform 
      corresponds to the insulin insensitivity and diabetes that are part of the DM 
      phenotype; because of insulin-receptor species differences, this effect is not 
      seen in mouse models of the disease. We now demonstrate that comparable splicing 
      abnormalities occur in DM2 muscle prior to the development of muscle 
      histopathology, thus demonstrating an early pathogenic effect of RNA expansions.

TI  - New methods for molecular diagnosis and demonstration of the (CCTG)n mutation in 
      myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2).
PG  - 274-83
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 are autosomal dominant, multisystemic disorders 
      with many similarities in their clinical manifestations. Myotonic dystrophy type 
      1 is caused by a (CTG)n expansion in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene 
      in 19q13.3 and myotonic dystrophy type 2 by a (CCTG)n expansion in intron 1 of 
      ZNF9 in 3q21.3. However, the clinical diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy type 2 is 
      more complex than that of myotonic dystrophy type 1, and conventional molecular 
      genetic methods used for diagnosing myotonic dystrophy type 1 are insufficient 
      for myotonic dystrophy type 2. Herein we describe two in situ hybridization 
      protocols for the myotonic dystrophy type 2 mutation detection. Chromogenic in 
      situ hybridization was used to detect both the genomic expansion and the mutant 
      transcripts in muscle biopsy sections. Chromogenic in situ hybridization can be 
      used in routine myotonic dystrophy type 2 diagnostics. Fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization on extended DNA fibers was used to directly visualize the myotonic 
      dystrophy type 2 mutation and to estimate the repeat expansion sizes.

TI  - Inhibition of myogenesis in transgenic mice expressing the human DMPK 3'-UTR.
PG  - 589-600
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is a multisystemic disorder caused by a CTG repeat 
      expansion within the 3'-UTR of the DMPK gene. DM1 is characterized by delayed 
      muscle development, muscle weakness and wasting, cardiac conduction 
      abnormalities, cognitive defects and cataracts. Recent studies have demonstrated 
      that the disease mechanism involves a dominant gain-of-function conferred upon 
      mutant transcripts by expanded repeats. However, further attempts to model 
      aspects of DM muscle pathology in cultured myoblasts suggest that 3'-UTR 
      sequences flanking the CTG repeat tract are also required for full expression of 
      the disease phenotype. Here, we report that overexpression of the DMPK 3'-UTR 
      including either wild-type (11) or expanded (91) CTG repeats results in aberrant 
      and delayed muscle development in fetal transgenic mice. In addition, transgenic 
      animals with both expanded and wild-type CTG repeats display muscle atrophy at 3 
      months of age. Primary myoblast cultures from both 11 and 91 repeat mice display 
      reduced fusion potential, but a greater reduction is observed in the 91 repeat 
      cultures. Taken together, these data indicate that overexpression of the DMPK 
      3'-UTR interferes with normal muscle development in mice and that this is 
      exacerbated by inclusion of a mutant repeat. This suggests that the delayed 
      muscle development in DM1 involves an interplay between the expanded CTG repeat 
      and adjacent 3'-UTR sequences.

TI  - Lack of correlation between the reduction of serum immunoglobulin concentration 
      and the CTG repeat expansion in patients with type 1 dystrophia [correction of 
      Dystrofia] myotonica.
PG  - 100-4
AB  - The length of the CTG repeat in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene is 
      considered to be associated with clinical severity in type 1 Dystrofia Myotonica 
      (DM1) and has also been suggested to correlate with the degree of deficiency of 
      IgG noted in these patients. Total serum level of IgG and IgG subclasses was 
      therefore measured in 61 Swedish patients with DM1, the largest number of 
      patients investigated to date in this respect. Almost half (44%) of the DM1 
      patients showed a serum concentration of IgG below the normal range. Deficiency 
      of IgG1, IgG2 or IgG3 was noted in 26%, 7% and 20% of the patients, respectively. 
      As transcription of genes 3' of the DMPK gene on chromosome 19 is reduced in DM1 
      patients, a decreased expression of the alpha chain of the receptor involved in 
      IgG catabolism, FcRn, may theoretically be responsible for the low serum IgG in 
      DM1 patients. No correlation was however found between the number of CTG repeats, 
      levels of FcRn transcripts in either muscle tissue or lymphocytes and serum IgG 
      levels.

TI  - Confirmation of the type 2 myotonic dystrophy (CCTG)n expansion mutation in 
      patients with proximal myotonic myopathy/proximal myotonic dystrophy of different 
      European origins: a single shared haplotype indicates an ancestral founder 
      effect.
PG  - 835-48
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM), the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults, is 
      a clinically and genetically heterogeneous neuromuscular disorder. DM is 
      characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, muscular dystrophy, myotonia, 
      and multisystem involvement. Type 1 DM (DM1) is caused by a (CTG)(n) expansion in 
      the 3' untranslated region of DMPK in 19q13.3. Multiple families, predominantly 
      of German descent and with clinically variable presentation that included 
      proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM) and type 2 DM (DM2) but without the DM1 
      mutation, showed linkage to the 3q21 region and were recently shown to segregate 
      a (CCTG)(n) expansion mutation in intron 1 of ZNF9. Here, we present linkage to 
      3q21 and mutational confirmation in 17 kindreds of European origin with PROMM and 
      proximal myotonic dystrophy, from geographically distinct populations. All 
      patients have the DM2 (CCTG)(n) expansion. To study the evolution of this 
      mutation, we constructed a comprehensive physical map of the DM2 region around 
      ZNF9. High-resolution haplotype analysis of disease chromosomes with five 
      microsatellite and 22 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers around the DM2 
      mutation identified extensive linkage disequilibrium and a single shared 
      haplotype of at least 132 kb among patients from the different populations. With 
      the exception of the (CCTG)(n) expansion, the available markers indicate that the 
      DM2 haplotype is identical to the most common haplotype in normal individuals. 
      This situation is reminiscent of that seen in DM1. Taken together, these data 
      suggest a single founding mutation in DM2 patients of European origin. We 
      estimate the age of the founding haplotype and of the DM2 (CCTG) expansion 
      mutation to be approximately 200-540 generations.

TI  - The pleiotropic expression of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase gene 
      illustrates the complex relationships between genetic, biological and clinical 
      covariates of male aging.
PG  - 223-32
AB  - Aging is a complex process modulated by multiple interactions between 
      environmental and genetic factors. Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is an autosomal 
      dominant disorder caused by an unstable (CTG)n repeat expansion in the DM1 
      protein kinase (DMPK) gene. The affected male patients' life expectancy at birth 
      (53.2 years) is more than two decades below that observed in most occidental 
      populations. The DMPK gene expression is pleiotropic and includes the premature 
      expression of several age-related signs, symptoms and metabolic disturbances 
      including hormonal dysfunctions, progressive decrease in muscular mass, presenile 
      cataracts, alopecia, reduced alertness, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, 
      erectile dysfunction and hypogonadism. The aim of this study was to analyze the 
      relationship between aging covariates and the severity of DM1 expression in 136 
      DM1 male subjects. DM1 clinical expression was assessed on a validated 
      neuromuscular disability rating scale and was correlated with plasma total 
      testosterone (rs = -0.31, p < 0.001), luteinizing hormone (LH) (rs = 0.52, p < 
      0.001) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) (rs = 0.54, p < 0.001) levels. 
      Following LH releasing hormone stimulation, FSH and LH concentrations increased 
      as a function of DM1 severity (p < 0.05). Muscular disability in DM1 was also 
      positively associated with fasting plasma insulin and triglyceride concentrations 
      (p < 0.05). The association of plasma apolipoprotein B and low-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol levels with DM1 was not linear across their distribution 
      and tended to reflect cell membrane damage progression. These results suggest 
      that DM1, a simple Mendelian trait, can represent a valuable model to illustrate 
      the complex relationships between variables associated with male aging.

TI  - Middle latency auditory-evoked potentials in myotonic dystrophy: relation to the 
      size of the CTG trinucleotide repeat and intelligent quotient.
PG  - 31-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Major components of MLAEPs are thought to originate in the temporal 
      lobe. Absence of the Pb potential has been demonstrated in MLAEPs in Alzheimer's 
      disease and demented Parkinson's disease patients. To validate usefulness of 
      middle latency auditory-evoked potentials (MLAEPs) in evaluating the central 
      nervous system (CNS) involvement of myotonic dystrophy (MyD). METHODS: MLAEPs 
      were recorded in eight patients with MyD and nine normal control subjects. In the 
      patient group, the size of the CTG triplet repeat expansion within the dystrophia 
      myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene and the revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence 
      Scale (WAIS-R) were also assessed. RESULTS: The latency of the Nb potential 
      showed a significant correlation with the size of the CTG repeat expansion 
      (r=0.734, P=0.036). The Pb latency also tended to prolong according to CTG 
      amplification (r=0.644, P=0.087). The amplitudes of Na and Pa significantly 
      increased compared with those of normal control subjects (P=0.024 and 0.016, 
      respectively). However, they did not correlate with IQ or CTG amplification. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal MLAEPs may indicate CNS involvement in MyD. Although the 
      precise generating mechanisms of Nb are unclear, the correlation of Nb latency 
      with CTG amplification suggests that MLAEPs can reflect the extent of genetic 
      abnormality.

TI  - Mutant DMPK 3'-UTR transcripts disrupt C2C12 myogenic differentiation by 
      compromising MyoD.
PG  - 419-29
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by two similar noncoding repeat expansion 
      mutations (DM1 and DM2). It is thought that both mutations produce pathogenic RNA 
      molecules that accumulate in nuclear foci. The DM1 mutation is a CTG expansion in 
      the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of dystrophia myotonica protein kinase 
      (DMPK). In a cell culture model, mutant transcripts containing a (CUG)200 DMPK 
      3'-UTR disrupt C2C12 myoblast differentiation; a phenotype similar to what is 
      observed in myoblast cultures derived from DM1 patient muscle. Here, we have used 
      our cell culture model to investigate how the mutant 3'-UTR RNA disrupts 
      differentiation. We show that MyoD protein levels are compromised in cells that 
      express mutant DMPK 3'-UTR transcripts. MyoD, a transcription factor required for 
      the differentiation of myoblasts during muscle regeneration, activates 
      differentiation-specific genes by binding E-boxes. MyoD levels are significantly 
      reduced in myoblasts expressing the mutant 3'-UTR RNA within the first 6 h under 
      differentiation conditions. This reduction correlates with blunted E-box-mediated 
      gene expression at time points that are critical for initiating differentiation. 
      Importantly, restoring MyoD levels rescues the differentiation defect. We 
      conclude that mutant DMPK 3'-UTR transcripts disrupt myoblast differentiation by 
      reducing MyoD levels below a threshold required to activate the differentiation 
      program.

      cataract, insulin resistance, and mental impairment, is caused by the expansion 
      of an unstable CTG repeat located in the 3' untranslated region of DMPK. The 
      repeat expansion suppresses the expression of the homeobox gene SIX5. We describe 
      here an experimental system to identify downstream transcriptional targets of 
      mouse Six5 in order to elucidate the role of SIX5 in the pathogenesis of DM1 and 
      development. By overexpressing a constitutively active Six5 (VP16-Six5wt) using 
      adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in P19 cells and subsequent expression 
      profiling using cDNA arrays, 21 genes, whose expression level increased by the 
      treatment, were identified as potential target genes. Genes expressed in the 
      somites, skeletal muscles, brain and meninges comprised the majority, suggesting 
      the role of Six5 in the development and function of mesodermal tissues and brain. 
      We provide evidence that Igfbp5 encoding a component of IGF signaling is a direct 
      Six5-target. Moreover, the overall expression level of Igfbp5 was decreased in 
      Six5-deficient mouse fibroblasts, and the response of human IGFBP5 to 
      MyoD-induced muscle conversion was altered in cells of DM1 patients. Our results 
      not only identify Six5 as an activator that directs Igfbp5 expression but also 
      suggest that reduced SIX5 expression in DM1 might contribute to specific aspects 
      of the DM1 phenotype.

TI  - Somatic expansion behaviour of the (CTG)n repeat in myotonic dystrophy knock-in 
      mice is differentially affected by Msh3 and Msh6 mismatch-repair proteins.
PG  - 191-8
AB  - The mechanism of expansion of the (CTG)n repeat in myotonic dystrophy (DM1) 
      patients and the cause of its pathobiological effects are still largely unknown. 
      Most likely, long repeats exert toxicity at the level of nuclear RNA transport or 
      splicing. Here, we analyse cis- and trans-acting parameters that determine repeat 
      behaviour in novel mouse models for DM1. Our mice carry 'humanized' myotonic 
      dystrophy protein kinase (Dmpk) allele(s) with either a (CTG)84 or a (CTG)11 
      repeat, inserted at the correct position into the endogenous DM locus. Unlike in 
      the human situation, the (CTG)84 repeat in the syntenic mouse environment was 
      relatively stable during intergenerational segregation. However, somatic tissues 
      showed substantial repeat expansions which were progressive upon aging and 
      prominent in kidney, and in stomach and small intestine, where it was cell-type 
      restricted. Other tissues examined showed only marginal size changes. The (CTG)11 
      allele was completely stable, as anticipated. Introducing the (CTG)84 allele into 
      an Msh3-deficient background completely blocked the somatic repeat instability. 
      In contrast, Msh6 deficiency resulted in a significant increase in the frequency 
      of somatic expansions. Competition of Msh3 and Msh6 for binding to Msh2 in 
      functional complexes with different DNA mismatch-recognition specificity may 
      explain why the somatic (CTG)n expansion rate is differentially affected by 
      ablation of Msh3 and Msh6.

TI  - 250 CTG repeats in DMPK is a threshold for correlation of expansion size and age 
      at onset of juvenile-adult DM1.
PG  - 131-9
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is associated with an expansion of CTG repeats in 
      the 3'UTR of the DMPK gene. It is accepted, as in other trinucleotide diseases, 
      that the number of the repeats is correlated with age at onset and severity of 
      the disease. However, assessment of genotype-phenotype correlation in DM1 is 
      complicated with the expansion-biased somatic instability of mutant alleles over 
      time and difficulties in precise assessment of the number of repeats by standard 
      Southern blot hybridization. In order to clarify this issue we defined DM1 
      expansion size in lymphocytes by three parameters: size of progenitor, average, 
      and largest allele, using a more precise small-pool/long-range PCR technique. We 
      found a negative linear correlation of age at onset and average expansion size in 
      juvenile-adult DM1 patients (35 out of 46) whose progenitor allele is less than 
      245 repeats long. Our result favors the hypothesis of the existence of a 
      threshold in the progenitor allele size beyond which number of CTG repeats does 
      not influence age at onset. Potential clinical significance is that the average 
      allele size could be a useful indicator for the age at onset in juvenile-adult 
      DM1 patients with relatively short progenitor allele. To test whether somatic 
      instability of mutant alleles influences the progression of DM1, patients were 
      divided in three phenotypic classes according to the severity of neuromuscular 
      symptoms. We showed that the largest expansion in each DM1 phenotypic class 
      reflects somatic instability of mutant allele over time independently of 
      progenitor allele size and patient's age at sampling. The mean of the largest 
      expansion was significantly different between phenotypic classes, implying the 
      possible association between expansion-biased somatic instability of mutant 
      alleles over time and progression of neuromuscular symptoms.

TI  - Mice transgenic for the human myotonic dystrophy region with expanded CTG repeats 
      display muscular and brain abnormalities.
PG  - 2717-26
AB  - The autosomal dominant mutation causing myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is a CTG repeat 
      expansion in the 3'-UTR of the DM protein kinase (DMPK) gene. This multisystemic 
      disorder includes myotonia, progressive weakness and wasting of skeletal muscle 
      and extramuscular symptoms such as cataracts, testicular atrophy, endocrine and 
      cognitive dysfunction. The mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis are complex. 
      Recent reports have revealed that DMPK gene haploinsufficiency may account for 
      cardiac conduction defects whereas cataracts may be due to haploinsufficiency of 
      the neighboring gene, the DM-associated homeobox protein (DMAHP or SIX5) gene. 
      Furthermore, mice expressing the CUG expansion in an unrelated mRNA develop 
      myotonia and myopathy, consistent with an RNA gain of function. We demonstrated 
      that transgenic mice carrying the CTG expansion in its human DM1 context (>45 kb) 
      and producing abnormal DMPK mRNA with at least 300 CUG repeats, displayed 
      clinical, histological, molecular and electrophysiological abnormalities in 
      skeletal muscle consistent with those observed in DM1 patients. Like DM1 
      patients, these transgenic mice show abnormal tau expression in the brain. These 
      results provide further evidence for the RNA trans-dominant effect of the CUG 
      expansion, not only in muscle, but also in brain.

TI  - Coexpression of the CUG-binding protein reduces DM protein kinase expression in 
      COS cells.
PG  - 581-7
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the most common form of adult onset muscular 
      dystrophy. Patients have a large CTG repeat expansion in the 3' untranslated 
      region of the DMPK gene, which encodes DM protein kinase. RNA trans-dominant 
      models, which hypothesize that the expanded CUG trinucleotide repeat on DMPK mRNA 
      sequesters a factor or disrupts the RNA metabolism of the DMPK mRNA itself and 
      other mRNAs in a trans dominant manner, have been proposed. A candidate for the 
      sequestered factor, termed CUG-binding protein (CUG-BP), exists in several 
      alternatively spliced isoforms. We found a human isoform with a twelve base 
      insertion (deduced amino acids Leu-Tyr-Leu-Gln) and an isoform with a three base 
      insertion (deduced amino acid Ala) insertion. In order to elucidate the effects 
      of CUG-BP on DMPK expression, we introduced CUG-BP and DMPK cDNA transiently into 
      COS-7 cells. Cotransfection of CUG-BP did not significantly affect the expression 
      of either wild type or mutant DMPK at the mRNA level. On the other hand, 
      cotransfection of CUG-BP significantly affected the expression of both the wild 
      type and mutant DMPKs at the protein level. This reduction was remarkable when 
      the mutant DMPK construct was used.

TI  - Effect of triplet repeat expansion on chromatin structure and expression of DMPK 
      and neighboring genes, SIX5 and DMWD, in myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 281-91
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM), an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disease, is 
      associated with expansion of a polymorphic (CTG)n repeat in the 3'-untranslated 
      region of the DM protein kinase (DMPK) gene. The repeat expansion results in 
      decreased levels of DMPK mRNA and protein, but the mechanism for this decreased 
      expression is unknown. Loss of a nuclease-hypersensitive site in the region of 
      the repeat expansion has been observed in muscle and skin fibroblasts from DM 
      patients, indicating a change in local chromatin structure. This change in 
      chromatin structure has been proposed as a mechanism whereby the expression of 
      DMPK and neighboring genes, sine oculis homeobox (Drosophila) homolog 5 (SIX5) 
      and dystrophia myotonica-containing WD repeat motif (DMWD), might be affected. We 
      have developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method to assay the 
      chromatin sensitivity of the region adjacent to the repeat expansion in somatic 
      cell hybrids carrying either normal or affected DMPK alleles and show that 
      hybrids carrying expanded alleles exhibit decreased sensitivity to PvuII 
      digestion in this region. Semiquantitative multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR 
      (RT/PCR) assays of gene expression from the chromosomes carrying the expanded 
      alleles showed marked reduction of DMPK mRNA, partial inhibition of SIX5 
      expression from a congenital DM chromosome, and no reduction of DMWD mRNA. Nested 
      RT/PCR analysis of DMPK mRNA from somatic cell hybrids carrying the repeat 
      expansions revealed that most of the DMPK transcripts expressed from the expanded 
      alleles lacked exons 13 and 14, whereas full-length transcripts were expressed 
      predominantly from the normal alleles. These results suggest that the CTG repeat 
      expansion leads to a decrease in DMPK mRNA levels by affecting splicing at the 3' 
      end of the DMPK pre-mRNA transcript.

TI  - Muscleblind localizes to nuclear foci of aberrant RNA in myotonic dystrophy types 
      1 and 2.
PG  - 2165-70
AB  - The phenotypes in myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 (DM1 and DM2) are similar, 
      suggesting a shared pathophysiologic mechanism. DM1 is caused by expansion of a 
      CTG repeat in the DMPK gene. Pathogenic effects of this mutation are likely to be 
      mediated, at least in part, by the expanded CUG repeat in mutant mRNA. The mutant 
      transcripts are retained in the nucleus in multiple discrete foci. We 
      investigated the possibility that DM2 is also caused by expansion of a CTG repeat 
      or related sequence. Analysis of DNA by repeat expansion detection methods, and 
      RNA by ribonuclease protection, did not show an expanded CTG or CUG repeat in 
      DM2. However, hybridization of muscle sections with fluorescence-labeled 
      CAG-repeat oligonucleotides showed nuclear foci in DM2 similar to those seen in 
      DM1. Nuclear foci were present in all patients with symptomatic DM1 (n = 9) or 
      DM2 (n = 9) but not in any disease controls or healthy subjects (n = 23). The 
      foci were not seen with CUG- or GUC-repeat probes. Foci in DM2 were distinguished 
      from DM1 by lower stability of the probe-target duplex, suggesting that a 
      sequence related to the DM1 CUG expansion accumulates in the DM2 nucleus. 
      Muscleblind proteins, which interact with expanded CUG repeats in vitro, 
      localized to the nuclear foci in both DM1 and DM2. These results support the idea 
      that nuclear accumulation of mutant RNA is pathogenic in DM1, suggest that a 
      similar disease process occurs in DM2, and point to a role for muscleblind in the 
      pathogenesis of both disorders.

TI  - The myotonic dystrophy expanded CUG repeat tract is necessary but not sufficient 
      to disrupt C2C12 myoblast differentiation.
PG  - 1879-87
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a dominant neuromuscular disorder caused by a 
      trinucleotide (CTG) repeat expansion. Mutant DMPK 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) 
      transcripts aggregate in nuclear foci and are thought to impose dominant-negative 
      effects by interacting with RNA binding proteins. We demonstrated previously that 
      the mutant 3'-UTR RNA disrupted C2C12 myoblast differentiation, and that the CUG 
      expansion was necessary for this effect. Several proteins are known to interact 
      with the CUG tract or the region 3' (distal) to it. Here, using a library of 
      transfected C2C12 clones, we show that although transcripts containing a CUG 
      expansion alone or a CUG expansion plus the distal region of the DMPK 3'-UTR 
      accumulate into RNA foci, neither of these RNAs affect C2C12 myogenesis. Thus, 
      RNA foci formation, and perturbation of any RNA binding factors involved in this 
      process, are not sufficient to block myoblast differentiation. Interestingly, we 
      found that transcripts containing expanded CUG tracts can form both nuclear and 
      cytoplasmic RNA foci, demonstrating that factors involved in foci formation are 
      present in the nucleus and cytoplasm. RNA analysis of myogenic markers revealed 
      that the mutant DMPK 3'-UTR mRNA does not affect myoblast determination factors 
      MyoD or Myf5, but significantly impedes upregulation of the differentiation 
      factors myogenin and p21. C2C12 provide a good model to study adult muscle 
      regeneration. Our observations in this system may be relevant to the lack of a 
      regenerative response to continued muscle wasting in DM, and point to defects in 
      early events in the myogenic response to muscle damage.

TI  - Skeletal muscle Na currents in mice heterozygous for Six5 deficiency.
PG  - 153-8
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy results from a trinucleotide repeat expansion between the 
      myotonic dystrophy protein kinase gene (Dmpk), which encodes a serine-threonine 
      protein kinase, and the Six5 gene, which encodes a homeodomain protein. The 
      disease is characterized by late bursts of skeletal muscle Na channel openings, 
      and this is recapitulated in Dmpk -/- and Dmpk +/- murine skeletal muscle. To 
      test whether deficiency of the nearby Six5 gene also affected Na channel gating 
      in murine skeletal muscle, we measured Na currents from cell-attached patches in 
      Six5 +/- mice and age-matched wild-type and Dmpk +/- mice. Late bursts of Na 
      channel activity were defined as an opening probability >10% measured from 10 to 
      110 ms after depolarization. There was no significant difference in the 
      occurrence of late Na channel bursts in wild-type and Six5 +/- muscle, whereas in 
      Dmpk +/- muscle there was greater than fivefold increase in late bursts (P < 
      0.001). Compared with wild-type mice, Na current amplitude was unchanged in Six5 
      +/- muscle, whereas in Dmpk +/- muscle it was 36% reduced (P < 0.05). Thus, since 
      Six5 +/- mice do not exhibit the Na channel gating abnormality of Dmpk 
      deficiency, we conclude that Six5 deficiency does not contribute to the Na 
      channel gating abnormality seen in dystrophia myotonica patients.

TI  - A successful strategy for preimplantation genetic diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy 
      using multiplex fluorescent PCR.
PG  - 223-32
AB  - The most common form of inherited muscular dystrophy in adults is myotonic 
      dystrophy (DM), an autosomal-dominant disease caused by the expansion of an 
      unstable CTG repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the myotonin 
      protein kinase (DMPK) gene. Expanded (mutant) CTG repeat sequences are refractory 
      to conventional PCR, but alleles with a number of repeats within the normal range 
      can be readily amplified and detected. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) of 
      DM has been successfully applied. However, a misdiagnosis using the reported 
      protocol was recently documented. Two new PGD protocols for DM have been 
      developed which utilise multiplex fluorescent PCR. Ideally a linked polymorphic 
      marker, APOC2, is amplified in addition to the normal DMPK alleles, thus 
      providing a back-up diagnostic result. However, the two couples reported in the 
      present study were not fully informative at the APOC2 locus and so an unlinked 
      short tandem repeat (STR) marker, D21S1414, was substituted. The highly 
      polymorphic nature of the D21S1414, DMPK and APOC2 loci means that a very simple 
      genetic fingerprint can be generated by analyses of these loci. This allows most 
      DNA contaminants to be detected. Contamination is a significant problem for PGD 
      and is the primary reason for the inclusion of D21S1414 and APOC2 in this 
      protocol. This paper reports the first clinical experience and pregnancies 
      following PGD for DM using a multiplex fluorescent PCR protocol.

TI  - RNA CUG repeats sequester CUGBP1 and alter protein levels and activity of CUGBP1.
PG  - 7820-6
AB  - An RNA CUG triplet repeat binding protein, CUGBP1, regulates splicing and 
      translation of various RNAs. Expansion of RNA CUG repeats in the 3'-untranslated 
      repeat of the mutant myotonin protein kinase (DMPK) mRNA in myotonic dystrophy 
      (DM) is associated with alterations in binding activity of CUGBP1. To investigate 
      whether CUGBP1 is directly affected by expansion of CUG repeats in DM tissues, we 
      examined the intracellular status of CUGBP1 in DM patients as well as in cultured 
      cells over expressing RNA CUG repeats. The analysis of RNA-protein complexes 
      showed that, in control tissues, the majority of CUGBP1 is free of RNA, whereas 
      in DM patients the majority of CUGBP1 is associated with RNA containing CUG 
      repeats. Similarly to DM patients, overexpression of RNA CUG repeats in cultured 
      cells results in the re-allocation of CUGBP1 from a free state to the RNA.protein 
      complexes containing CUG repeats. CUG repeat-dependent translocation of CUGBP1 
      into RNA-protein complexes is associated with increased levels of CUGBP1 protein 
      and its binding activity. Experiments with cyclohexamide-dependent block of 
      protein synthesis showed that the half-life of CUGBP1 is increased in cells 
      expressing CUG repeats. Alteration of CUGBP1 in DM is accompanied by alteration 
      in translation of a transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta 
      (C/EBPbeta), which has been previously described to be a target of CUGBP1. 
      Analysis of C/EBPbeta isoforms in DM patients with altered levels of CUGBP1 
      showed that translation of a dominant negative isoform, LIP, is induced by 
      CUGBP1. Results of this paper demonstrate that the expansion of CUG repeats in DM 
      affects RNA-binding proteins and leads to alteration in RNA processing.

      identify any common founder haplotype in 30 clinically diagnosed unrelated DM 
      patients from eastern India. Our results revealed that in 27 patients (90%), CTG 
      expansion took place on a DraIII(-) - HhaI(-) - Alu(+) - HinfI(+) - Fnu4H I(-) - 
      TaqI(+) haplotype (haplotype I), similar to what have been published for 
      Caucasoid and other DM patients. However, in three patients (10%), the expansion 
      of CTG repeat was on DraIII(+) - HhaI(+) - Alu(+) - HinfI(-) - Fnu4H I(+) - 
      TaqI(-) background (haplotype II), indicating a new haplotype. The distribution 
      of haplotypes in 52 normal individuals of eastern India revealed that percentage 
      of haplotypes I and II were 23.1% and 7.7% respectively in normal chromosomes. 
      Haplotype II is absent among Caucasian DM patients as well as normal individuals 
      indicating that this particular haplotype may be characteristic of the Indian 
      population. Hum Mutat 16:372, 2000.

AB  - Triplet repeat diseases are disorders in which there is expansion of a repeat 
      sequence of three nucleotides in the affected gene. Although the pathology 
      usually results from production of a defective protein, myotonic dystrophy (DM) 
      has proved to be a puzzle because the expanded repeats appear in a non-coding 
      region of the affected DMPK gene. In a Perspective, Tapscott explains how 
      findings from a new mouse model of DM (Mankodi et al.) could solve this paradox.

TI  - Recruitment of human muscleblind proteins to (CUG)(n) expansions associated with 
      myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 4439-48
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder 
      associated with a (CTG)(n) expansion in the 3'-untranslated region of the DM1 
      protein kinase (DMPK) gene. To explain disease pathogenesis, the RNA dominance 
      model proposes that the DM1 mutation produces a gain-of-function at the RNA level 
      in which CUG repeats form RNA hairpins that sequester nuclear factors required 
      for proper muscle development and maintenance. Here, we identify the triplet 
      repeat expansion (EXP) RNA-binding proteins as candidate sequestered factors. As 
      predicted by the RNA dominance model, binding of the EXP proteins is specific for 
      dsCUG RNAs and proportional to the size of the triplet repeat expansion. 
      Remarkably, the EXP proteins are homologous to the Drosophila muscleblind 
      proteins required for terminal differentiation of muscle and photoreceptor cells. 
      EXP expression is also activated during mammalian myoblast differentiation, but 
      the EXP proteins accumulate in nuclear foci in DM1 cells. We propose that DM1 
      disease is caused by aberrant recruitment of the EXP proteins to the DMPK 
      transcript (CUG)(n) expansion.

TI  - Characterization of a monoclonal antibody panel shows that the myotonic dystrophy 
      protein kinase, DMPK, is expressed almost exclusively in muscle and heart.
PG  - 2167-73
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a multisystemic disorder caused by an inherited CTG 
      repeat expansion which affects three genes encoding the DM protein kinase (DMPK), 
      a homeobox protein Six5 and a protein containing WD repeats. Using a panel of 16 
      monoclonal antibodies against several different DMPK epitopes we detected DMPK, 
      as a single protein of approximately 80 kDa, only in skeletal muscle, cardiac 
      muscle and, to a lesser extent, smooth muscle. Many earlier reports of DMPK with 
      different sizes and tissue distributions appear to be due to antibody 
      cross-reactions with more abundant proteins. One such antibody, MANDM1, was used 
      to isolate two related protein kinases, MRCK alpha and beta, from a human brain 
      cDNA library and the shared epitope was located at the catalytic site of DMPK 
      using a phage-displayed random peptide library. The peptide library also 
      identified an epitope shared between DMPK and a 55 kDa muscle-specific protein. 
      The results suggest that effects of the repeat expansion on the DMPK gene may be 
      responsible for muscle and heart features of DM, whereas clinical changes in 
      other tissues may be due to effects on the other two genes.

TI  - Reduced expression of DMAHP/SIX5 gene in myotonic dystrophy muscle.
PG  - 1421-6
AB  - In myotonic dystrophy (DM), the expansion of CTG triplet repeats in the 
      3'-untranslated region of DM-protein kinase (DMPK) is a causal gene mutation. 
      However, the pathogenic molecular mechanism of CTG repeat expansion for DM 
      phenotypic expression is unclear. To investigate this issue, we examined the 
      influence of CTG repeat expansion on the expression levels of DMPK gene and 
      3'-flanking DM locus-associated homeodomain protein (DMAHP)/SIX5 gene in the 
      muscles of DM patients. We isolated RNA from muscle tissues of six DM patients 
      and six controls, and performed a competitive reverse transcriptional polymerase 
      chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The total mRNA level of DMAHP/SIX5 was 
      significantly lower in DM than in controls, but the DMPK mRNA level was 
      unchanged. Our results suggest that CTG repeat expansion influences the 
      expression of genes other than DMPK to cause the DM phenotype.

TI  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) protein kinase levels in congenital and adult DM 
      patients.
PG  - 507-12
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy is caused by a (CTG)n trinucleotide repeat expansion located 
      in the 3' untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase gene 
      (DMPK). To date, the disease mechanism has proven elusive. The mutation would not 
      be expected to affect kinase function and yet the disease is inherited in a 
      dominant fashion. Mutant DMPK transcripts have been demonstrated to be retained 
      in affected cell nuclei which could reduce DMPK protein levels and cause disease 
      by haploinsufficiency. An alternate hypothesis is that the expansion confers a 
      toxic gain of function on the transcript. In previous studies, various 52-55 kDa 
      proteins have been detected using antisera targeted against DMPK and a decline of 
      two of these candidates in disease tissues was reported. Current information now 
      suggests that these proteins are not products of the myotonic dystrophy gene. We 
      have characterised an antiserum which has been confirmed to recognise authentic 
      71 and 80 kDa isoforms of DMPK. Determination of the kinase levels in disease 
      tissues with controls for patient age and tissue integrity demonstrates a modest 
      overexpression in adult patients. In tissues from severely affected congenital 
      patients only a slight decline is seen. This data argues against DMPK 
      haploinsufficiency as a disease mechanism.

TI  - Heterozygous loss of Six5 in mice is sufficient to cause ocular cataracts.
PG  - 110-4
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by 
      skeletal muscle wasting, myotonia, cardiac arrhythmia, hyperinsulinaemia, mental 
      retardation and ocular cataracts. The genetic defect in DM is a CTG repeat 
      expansion located in the 3' untranslated region of DMPK and 5' of a 
      homeodomain-encoding gene, SIX5 (formerly DMAHP; refs 2-5). There are three 
      mechanisms by which CTG expansion can result in DM. First, repeat expansion may 
      alter the processing or transport of the mutant DMPK mRNA and consequently reduce 
      DMPK levels. Second, CTG expansion may establish a region of heterochromatin 3' 
      of the repeat sequence and decrease SIX5 transcription. Third, toxic effects of 
      the repeat expansion may be intrinsic to the repeated elements at the level of 
      DNA or RNA (refs 10,11). Previous studies have demonstrated that a dose-dependent 
      loss of Dm15 (the mouse DMPK homologue) in mice produces a partial DM phenotype 
      characterized by decreased development of skeletal muscle force and cardiac 
      conduction disorders. To test the role of Six5 loss in DM, we have analysed a 
      strain of mice in which Six5 was deleted. Our results demonstrate that the rate 
      and severity of cataract formation is inversely related to Six5 dosage and is 
      temporally progressive. Six5+/- and Six5-/- mice show increased steady-state 
      levels of the Na+/K+-ATPase alpha-1 subunit and decreased Dm15 mRNA levels. Thus, 
      altered ion homeostasis within the lens may contribute to cataract formation. As 
      ocular cataracts are a characteristic feature of DM, these results demonstrate 
      that decreased SIX5 transcription is important in the aetiology of DM. Our data 
      support the hypothesis that DM is a contiguous gene syndrome associated with the 
      partial loss of both DMPK and SIX5.

TI  - Mice deficient in Six5 develop cataracts: implications for myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 105-9
AB  - Expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3' UTR of the gene DMPK at the DM1 
      locus on chromosome 19 causes myotonic dystrophy, a dominantly inherited disease 
      characterized by skeletal muscle dystrophy and myotonia, cataracts and cardiac 
      conduction defects. Targeted deletion of Dm15, the mouse orthologue of human 
      DMPK, produced mice with a mild myopathy and cardiac conduction abnormalities, 
      but without other features of myotonic dystrophy, such as myotonia and cataracts. 
      We, and others, have demonstrated that repeat expansion decreases expression of 
      the adjacent gene SIX5 (refs 7,8), which encodes a homeodomain transcription 
      factor. To determine whether SIX5 deficiency contributes to the myotonic 
      dystrophy phenotype, we disrupted mouse Six5 by replacing the first exon with a 
      beta-galactosidase reporter. Six5-mutant mice showed reporter expression in 
      multiple tissues, including the developing lens. Homozygous mutant mice had no 
      apparent abnormalities of skeletal muscle function, but developed lenticular 
      opacities at a higher rate than controls. Our results suggest that SIX5 
      deficiency contributes to the cataract phenotype in myotonic dystrophy, and that 
      myotonic dystrophy represents a multigenic disorder.

TI  - Transgenic mice carrying large human genomic sequences with expanded CTG repeat 
      mimic closely the DM CTG repeat intergenerational and somatic instability.
PG  - 1185-94
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3'UTR of the 
      DM protein kinase (DMPK) gene. A very high level of instability is observed 
      through successive generations and the size of the repeat is generally correlated 
      with the severity of the disease and with age at onset. Furthermore, tissues from 
      DM patients exhibit somatic mosaicism that increases with age. We generated 
      transgenic mice carrying large human genomic sequences with 20, 55 or >300 CTG, 
      cloned from patients from the same affected DM family. Using large human flanking 
      sequences and a large amplification, we demonstrate that the intergenerational 
      CTG repeat instability is reproduced in mice, with a strong bias towards 
      expansions and with the same sex- and size-dependent characteristics as in 
      humans. Moreover, a high level of instability, increasing with age, can be 
      observed in tissues and in sperm. Although we did not observe dramatic expansions 
      (or 'big jumps' over several hundred CTG repeats) as in congenital forms of DM, 
      our model carrying >300 CTG is the first to show instability so close to the 
      human DM situation. Our three models carrying different sizes of CTG repeat 
      provide insight on the different factors modulating the CTG repeat instability.

TI  - Constitutive and regulated modes of splicing produce six major myotonic dystrophy 
      protein kinase (DMPK) isoforms with distinct properties.
PG  - 605-16
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the most prevalent inherited neuromuscular disease in 
      adults. The genetic defect is a CTG triplet repeat expansion in the 
      3'-untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase ( DMPK ) gene, 
      consisting of 15 exons. Using a transgenic DMPK-overexpressor mouse model, we 
      demonstrate here that the endogenous mouse DMPK gene and the human DMPK transgene 
      produce six major alternatively spliced mRNAs which have almost identical cell 
      type-dependent distribution frequencies and expression patterns. Use of a cryptic 
      5' splice site in exon 8, which results in absence or presence of 15 nucleotides 
      specifying a VSGGG peptide motif, and/or use of a cryptic 3' splice site in exon 
      14, which leads to a frameshift in the mRNA reading frame, occur as independent 
      stochastic events in all tissues examined. In contrast, the excision of exons 
      13/14 that causes a frameshift and creates a C-terminally truncated protein is 
      clearly cell type dependent and occurs predominantly in smooth muscle. We 
      generated all six full-length mouse cDNAs that result from combinations of these 
      three major splicing events and show that their transfection into cells in 
      culture leads to production of four different approximately 74 kDa full-length 
      (heart-, skeletal muscle- or brain-specific) and two C-terminally truncated 
      approximately 68 kDa (smooth muscle-specific) isoforms. Information on DMPK mRNA 
      and protein isoform expression patterns will be useful for recognizing 
      differential effects of (CTG)(n)expansion in DM manifestation.

TI  - Expanded CUG repeat RNAs form hairpins that activate the double-stranded 
      RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR.
PG  - 79-87
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy is caused by an expanded CTG repeat in the 3' untranslated 
      region of the DM protein kinase (DMPK) gene. The expanded repeat triggers the 
      nuclear retention of mutant DMPK transcripts, but the resulting underexpression 
      of DMPK probably does not fully account for the severe phenotype. One proposed 
      disease mechanism is that nuclear accumulation of expanded CUG repeats may 
      interfere with nuclear function. Here we show by thermal melting and nuclease 
      digestion studies that CUG repeats form highly stable hairpins. Furthermore, CUG 
      repeats bind to the dsRNA-binding domain of PKR, the dsRNA-activated protein 
      kinase. The threshold for binding to PKR is approximately 15 CUG repeats, and the 
      affinity increases with longer repeat lengths. Finally, CUG repeats that are 
      pathologically expanded can activate PKR in vitro. These results raise the 
      possibility that the disease mechanism could be, in part, a gain of function by 
      mutant DMPK transcripts that involves sequestration or activation of dsRNA 
      binding proteins.

TI  - CTG repeats distribution and Alu insertion polymorphism at myotonic dystrophy 
      (DM) gene in Amhara and Oromo populations of Ethiopia.
PG  - 165-7
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a dominantly inherited neuromuscular disease, highly 
      variable and multisystemic, which is caused by the expansion of a CTG repeat 
      located in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. Normal alleles show a 
      copy number of 5-37 repeats on normal chromosomes, amplified to 50-3000 copies on 
      DM chromosomes. The trinucleotide repeat shows a trimodal allele distribution in 
      the majority of the examined population. The first class includes alleles 
      carrying (CTG)5, the second class, alleles in the range 7-18 repeats, and the 
      third class, alleles (CTG) > or =19. The frequency of this third class is 
      directly related to the prevalence of DM in different populations, suggesting 
      that normal large-sized alleles predispose toward DM. We studied CTG repeat 
      allele distribution and Alu insertion and/or deletion polymorphism at the 
      myotonic dystrophy locus in two major Ethiopian populations, the Amhara and 
      Oromo. CTG allele distribution and haplotype analysis on a total of 224 normal 
      chromosomes showed significant differences between the two ethnic groups. These 
      differences have a bearing on the out-of-Africa hypothesis for the origin of the 
      DM mutation. In addition, (CTG) > or =19 were exclusively detected in the Amhara 
      population, confirming the predisposing role of these alleles compared with the 
      DM expansion-mutation.

TI  - Elongation of (CTG)n repeats in myotonic dystrophy protein kinase gene in tumors 
      associated with myotonic dystrophy patients.
PG  - 1271-4
AB  - Length of (CTG)n triplet repeats in myotonic dystrophy protein kinase gene (DMPK) 
      was estimated in tumors, normal tissues of the same organs, muscles, and 
      leukocytes from three myotonic dystrophy (DM) patients and a non-DM patient. 
      Using cDNA 25 as a probe, a Southern blot analysis of EcoRI- and BglI-digested 
      DNA from these tissues demonstrated the longest expansion of the repeats in the 
      tumors of DM patients. In all tissues from a non-DM patient, the repeat length 
      was confirmed to be stable by PCR analysis. Our data suggest that expanded (CTG)n 
      repeat in tumor tissues may have increased the instability. This study emphasizes 
      the importance of a long-term prospective study on the incidence of tumors in DM 
      to clarify the pathological interrelation between the two entities.

TI  - Cognitive impairment and (CTG)n expansion in myotonic dystrophy patients.
PG  - 425-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a genetic multisystemic disease with 
      muscular, endocrine, ocular, cardiac and cognitive impairment. The molecular 
      basis of the disease has been identified in an unstable base triplet (CTG)n 
      repeat located in the 3' untranslated region of the miotonin protein-kinase 
      (MT-PK) gene on the long arm of chromosome 19. Cognitive impairment could be a 
      direct expression of this genetic alteration at the central nervous system (CNS) 
      level rather than a consequence of the neuromuscular impairment. To explore this 
      hypothesis, we tested a group of genetically diagnosed, adult onset DM, of their 
      nonaffected relatives (NAR), of patients with spinal muscle atrophy (SMA), and of 
      normal controls using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). METHODS: 
      Seventeen adult-onset DM patients, 9 NAR, 10 SMA patients and 20 unrelated normal 
      controls (NC) were studied. Clinical, neuromuscular and neuropsychiatric 
      evaluation, which included WAIS and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and 
      Schizophrenia (SADS), were performed on the four groups. DM, NAR and NC were also 
      assessed by a neurophysiological (P300) evaluation. A DNA analysis was performed 
      in DM and in NAR to measure presence and magnitude of CTG expansion. RESULTS: We 
      found a statistically significant difference between verbal (p < .0003), 
      nonverbal (p < .0001) and total (p < .0001) IQ of DM patients compared to IQs of 
      NAR, SMA and NC. Seven out of 11 WAIS subtests were significantly and 
      consistently lower in DM patients compared to SMA and/or NC. In DM patients there 
      was a statistically significant negative correlation between nonverbal (r = -.68; 
      p < .002) and total (r = .59; p < .01) IQ and (CTG)n. Patients with DM had a 
      significantly lower P300 amplitude compared to NAR and NC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study 
      indicates that in DM there is a mild but significant cognitive impairment which 
      correlates with the degree of CTG expansion and it is not dependent on the 
      neuromuscular impairment; however further studies with larger groups of patients 
      and controls are suggested to confirm our results, due to the small sample size 
      and to a possible effect of educational level in our patients.

TI  - Simultaneous analysis of expression of the three myotonic dystrophy locus genes 
      in adult skeletal muscle samples: the CTG expansion correlates inversely with 
      DMPK and 59 expression levels, but not DMAHP levels.
PG  - 1053-60
AB  - The causative mutation in the majority of cases of myotonic dystrophy has been 
      shown to be the expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat, but the mechanism(s) by 
      which this repeat leads to the very complex symptomatology in this disorder 
      remains controversial. We have developed a highly sensitive and quantifiable 
      assay, based on competitive RT-PCR, to test the hypothesis that the expansion 
      disrupts the expression of the genes in its immediate vicinity, DMPK, 59 and 
      DMAHP. In order to avoid cell culture-induced artifacts we performed these 
      experiments using adult skeletal muscle biopsy samples and analysed total 
      cytoplasmic poly(A)+mRNA levels for each gene simultaneously, as this is more 
      physiologically relevant than allele-specific levels. There was considerable 
      overlap between the expression levels of the three genes in myotonic dystrophy 
      patient samples and samples from control individuals. However, in the myotonic 
      dystrophy samples we detected a strong inverse correlation between the repeat 
      size and the levels of expression of DMPK and 59. This is the first report of a 
      possible effect of the CTG expansion on gene 59. Our results indicate that whilst 
      a simple dosage model of gene expression in the presence of the mutation is 
      unlikely to be sufficient in itself to explain the complex molecular pathology in 
      this disease, the repeat expansion may be a significant modifier of the 
      expression of these two genes.

TI  - Myotonic dystrophy: tissue-specific effect of somatic CTG expansions on 
      allele-specific DMAHP/SIX5 expression.
PG  - 1017-23
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM), the most common inherited muscle disorder, is caused by 
      a CTG expansion in the 3"-untranslated region of a protein kinase gene ( DMPK ). 
      The complex and variable phenotype is most likely caused by a complex molecular 
      pathogenesis, including deficiency of the DMPK protein, a trans -dominant 
      misregulation of RNA homeostasis and haploinsufficiency of a neighboring homeobox 
      gene [DM locus-associated homeodomain protein (DMAHP )]. Here, we study the 
      allele-specific transcriptional activity of the DMAHP/SIX5 gene in DM patient 
      tissues. Using a quantitative fluorescent RT-PCR assay, we tested allele-specific 
      accumulation of DMAHP/SIX5 transcripts in both total and poly(A)+pools. In muscle 
      biopsies, we found that transcript reductions of DMAHP/SIX5 alleles in cis with 
      CTG expansions correlated with the extent of expansion. A patient with 
      approximately 90 CTG repeats in muscle DNA (normal n < 37) showed a 20% reduction 
      of allele-specific transcript levels, while four other DM patients with larger 
      expansions showed 80% reductions. The effects of the CTG expansions on DMAHP 
      transcription were tissue specific: autopsy tissues from a patient with 1500 
      repeats showed 80% reductions in muscle and liver; however, RNA from other 
      tissues (lung, aorta, heart conduction tissue, cerebellum) showed 0-20% 
      reductions. Our results suggest that the effect of the CTG repeat on the 
      DMAHP/SIX5 promoter is variable and tissue-specific. Our data are consistent with 
      abnormalities of DMAHP/SIX5 probably having a more prominent role in disease 
      pathogenesis in muscle, liver and brain, but being less important in other 
      tissues.

TI  - Myotonic dystrophy: the correlation of (CTG) repeat length in leucocytes with age 
      at onset is significant only for patients with small expansions.
PG  - 59-61
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) was the first of a group of diseases to be identified for 
      which the genetic basis is the expansion of a triplet repeat. Myotonic dystrophy 
      also exhibits anticipation, in which the disease worsens through successive 
      generations. These two features have led many groups to analyse whether a 
      significant negative correlation between triplet repeat length and severity of 
      disease exists. However, the recent molecular finding that two distinct subsets 
      of classically affected DM patients exist, those who export expansion derived 
      DMPK RNA and those who do not, led us to question whether combining data from 
      these two sets of patients is statistically valid. We found that although 
      patients with small expansions showed a significant correlation between age at 
      onset and triplet repeat length, those with larger expansions did not. The 
      theoretical triplet repeat size, which separated the two groups, was also 
      deduced.

TI  - Cardiac elav-type RNA-binding protein (ETR-3) binds to RNA CUG repeats expanded 
      in myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 53-60
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a neuromuscular disorder associated with CTG triplet 
      repeat expansion in the myotonin protein kinase gene ( DMPK ). We previously 
      proposed a hypothesis suggesting that the expanded CUG repeats sequester specific 
      RNA-binding proteins and that such a sequestration results in abnormal RNA 
      processing of several RNAs containing CUG repeats in multiple tissues affected in 
      patients with DM. One of the members of the CUG-binding proteins, CUG-BP, has 
      been identified previously. Here we describe the second member of this family, 
      elav -type ribonucleoprotein (ETR-3), which is highly expressed in heart and is 
      able to interact with CUG repeats. Screening of a mouse liver cDNA library with a 
      CUG-BP probe identified two mETR-3 cDNAs. Two additional cDNAs from mouse heart 
      were amplified by RT-PCR. These cDNAs differ by several insertions/deletions and 
      might be generated via alternative splicing. Mouse ETR-3 has a mol. wt of 50 kDa 
      and displays a high level of homology to CUG-BP protein. The organization of the 
      RNA-binding domains (RBDs) within the ETR-3 molecule is similar to one within 
      CUG-BP. A study of mETR-3 RNA-binding activity showed that the mETR-3 binds to 
      (CUG)8repeats. Sequence analysis of mETR-3 indicates the presence of several CUG 
      repeats within the mETR-3 mRNA. Both CUG-BP and mETR-3 bind to mETR-3 mRNA via 
      CUG repeats, suggesting the possible involvement of CUG-BP-like proteins in the 
      regulation of mETR-3 processing. Analysis of the tissue distribution of ETR-3 
      showed that in human cells, ETR-3 mRNA is highly expressed in heart, but is 
      undetectable in other tissues examined. Our results suggest the existence of a 
      family of proteins that bind to CUG repeats and might be affected in DM by 
      expansion of CUG repeats.

TI  - Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of the replication properties of the 
      myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene region.
PG  - 247-50
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by an expansion of a CTG repeat sequence in the 
      3' noncoding region of a protein kinase gene (DMPK) at 19q13.3. We used in situ 
      hybridization to analyse the replication timing of the genomic region containing 
      DMPK in fibroblasts and myoblasts from controls and myotonic dystrophy patients. 
      In this method the relative proportion of singlet to doublet hybridization 
      signals is used to infer the relative time of replication of specific loci or 
      regions. Our results show that in cells from normal individuals approximately 65% 
      of signals appear as doublets, indicating early replication. In DM patients with 
      a number of CTG repeats ranging from about 600-1800 we observed a significant 
      increase of singlet-doublets compared to the background level. These results 
      suggest the existence of replication alternations and/or structural differences 
      between the normal and mutant alleles induced by the presence of the DM mutation.

TI  - Somatic instability of the CTG repeat in mice transgenic for the myotonic 
      dystrophy region is age dependent but not correlated to the relative intertissue 
      transcription levels and proliferative capacities.
PG  - 1285-91
AB  - A (CTG)nexpansion in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the DM protein kinase 
      gene ( DMPK ) is responsible for causing myotonic dystrophy (DM). Major 
      instability, with very large expansions between generations and high levels of 
      somatic mosaicism, is observed in patients. There is a good correlation between 
      repeat size (at least in leucocytes), clinical severity and age of onset. The 
      trinucleotide repeat instability mechanisms involved in DM and other human 
      genetic diseases are unknown. We studied somatic instability by measuring the CTG 
      repeat length at several ages in various tissues of transgenic mice carrying a 
      (CTG)55expansion surrounded by 45 kb of the human DM region, using small-pool 
      PCR. These mice have been shown to reproduce the intergenerational and somatic 
      instability of the 55 CTG repeat suggesting that surrounding sequences and the 
      chromatin environment are involved in instability mechanisms. As observed in some 
      of the tissues of DM patients, there is a tendency for repeat length and somatic 
      mosaicism to increase with the age of the mouse. Furthermore, we observed no 
      correlation between the somatic mutation rate and tissue proliferation capacity. 
      The somatic mutation rates in different tissues were also not correlated to the 
      relative inter-tissue difference in transcriptional levels of the three genes 
      (DMAHP , DMPK and 59) surrounding the repeat.

TI  - Ribozyme-mediated trans-splicing of a trinucleotide repeat.
PG  - 378-81
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansions (TREs) are a recently described class of 
      mutations characterized by a change in the size of the genomic fragment due to 
      amplification of the repeated unit. A number of diseases have been attributed to 
      TRE, including Huntington disease and myotonic dystrophy (DM), but attempts at 
      genetic therapy have yet to prove successful. A potential therapeutic approach 
      would be to repair the expanded repeat using the trans-splicing ability of group 
      I intron ribozymes. We have used DM as a model to test this hypothesis. A group I 
      intron ribozyme (DMPK-RZ1) was designed to modify the TRE at the 3' end of the 
      human myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) transcripts. DMPK-RZ1 was shown to 
      ligate a small DMPK mRNA fragment, contained within the ribozyme, to a simple 
      DMPK-target RNA in vitro. It also modified a larger target transcript, leading to 
      replacement of twelve repeats with five repeats, both in vitro and in mammalian 
      cells. Finally, this ribozyme successfully replaced the 3' end of endogenous DMPK 
      mRNA in fibroblasts with a different 3' region. Ribozyme-mediated RNA repair may 
      thus form a novel therapeutic strategy for diseases associated with repeat 
      expansions.

TI  - Abnormal calcium metabolism in myotonic dystrophy as shown by the 
      Ellsworth-Howard test and its relation to CTG triplet repeat length.
PG  - 613-22
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by 
      peculiar clinical features. Its molecular basis is the unstable expansion of a 
      CTG triplet repeat in the gene encoding myotonin protein kinase (Mt-PK), the 
      nucleotide sequence of which has extensive homology to the cyclic AMP 
      (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase gene. Extensive efforts have been made to clarify 
      the signal transduction pathway in which the responsible gene operates, but 
      confirming evidence has yet to be obtained. Because some symptoms in DM are 
      similar to those in hypoparathyroidism, we divided 24 DM patients into two groups 
      on the basis of their serum calcium levels; Group 1, those with normocalcemia (11 
      patients), and group 2, those with hypocalcemia (13 patients). The highly 
      sensitive parathyroid hormone (HS-PTH) plasma levels in group 1 were within 
      normal limits, whereas those in group 2 were abnormally high. Laboratory findings 
      for the group 2 patients resembled those for pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP), 
      whereas those for group 1 patients were normal. The Ellsworth-Howard (EH) test 
      was used to determine which type of PHP the group 2 patients belonged to. Both 
      the phosphaturic (delta P) and urinary cAMP (UcAMP) responses were estimated. The 
      delta P responses in group 2 were significantly lower than those in group 1, but 
      their UcAMP responses did not differ. This is evidence that group 2 patients had 
      PHP type II, whereas group 1 patients were normal. We also investigated whether 
      the disease severity differed between the groups. Cataracts, ectopic 
      calcifications, and ossifications, which are associated with PHP, were more 
      frequent in group 2. In addition, the mean IQ in that group was significantly 
      lower. Clinically, the group 2 signs agreed well with those of PHP, whereas for 
      group 1 there was only a slight similarity. These results are additional evidence 
      that the patients in group 2 have abnormal calcium metabolism, the abnormality 
      being in the postadenylate cyclase-cAMP pathway in the renal tubular cells. The 
      degree of (CTG)n expansion, the so-called expanded DNA fragment (EF) size, was 
      determined by standard Southern blot analysis. The allelic EF sizes in both 
      groups were greater than in the healthy controls. Moreover, those in group 2 were 
      significantly longer than those in group 1. We therefore investigated whether EF 
      size is correlated with the serum calcium and plasma PTH levels, the delta P 
      responses in the EH test, and IQ. All these items were significantly correlated 
      with EF size. Our findings show that the expanded DNA fragment size in DM is 
      correlated with the degree of abnormal calcium metabolism.

TI  - Dynamic balance of segregation distortion and selection maintains normal allele 
      sizes at the myotonic dystrophy locus.
PG  - 93-112
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM), an autosomal dominant neurological disorder, is caused 
      by CTG-repeat expansions at the DMPK locus, with affected individuals having > or 
      = 50 repeats of this trinucleotide. Reduced reproductive fitness of affected 
      individuals and decreased viability of congenital DM have been noted. Expanded 
      CTG-repeat alleles are highly unstable, predominantly yielding even higher repeat 
      sizes. Preferential transmission of longer alleles from heterozygous mothers 
      within the normal size range of alleles also is observed. In view of these 
      observations, it is worth examining how DM has been maintained in human 
      populations for hundreds of generations. We present an analysis of the dynamic 
      properties of a model of joint effects of segregation distortion and selection 
      (intensity of which increases with allele sizes of an individual's genotype). Our 
      mathematical formulation and numerical analyses demonstrate that a weak 
      segregation distortion during female meiosis, together with selection of 
      comparable intensity (within the normal allele size range), can maintain an 
      equilibrium distribution of allele frequencies. Genetic drift, acting in 
      conjunction with the occasional contraction of alleles by mutation, can 
      contribute to the balance of segregation distortion and mutation, in the sense 
      that even weaker selection can explain the observed allele frequencies. The model 
      is applied to CTG-repeat size distributions at the DMPK locus, observed in normal 
      individuals from world populations.

TI  - Altered phosphorylation and intracellular distribution of a (CUG)n triplet repeat 
      RNA-binding protein in patients with myotonic dystrophy and in myotonin protein 
      kinase knockout mice.
PG  - 13221-6
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is associated with expansion of CTG repeats in the 
      3'-untranslated region of the myotonin protein kinase (DMPK) gene. The molecular 
      mechanism whereby expansion of the (CUG)n repeats in the 3'-untranslated region 
      of DMPK gene induces DM is unknown. We previously isolated a protein with 
      specific binding to CUG repeat sequences (CUG-BP/hNab50) that possibly plays a 
      role in mRNA processing and/or transport. Here we present evidence that the 
      phosphorylation status and intracellular distribution of the RNA CUG-binding 
      protein, identical to hNab50 protein (CUG-BP/hNab50), are altered in homozygous 
      DM patient and that CUG-BP/hNab50 is a substrate for DMPK both in vivo and in 
      vitro. Data from two biological systems with reduced levels of DMPK, homozygous 
      DM patient and DMPK knockout mice, show that DMPK regulates both phosphorylation 
      and intracellular localization of the CUG-BP/hNab50 protein. Decreased levels of 
      DMPK observed in DM patients and DMPK knockout mice led to the elevation of the 
      hypophosphorylated form of CUG-BP/hNab50. Nuclear concentration of the 
      hypophosphorylated CUG-BP/hNab50 isoform is increased in DMPK knockout mice and 
      in homozygous DM patient. DMPK also interacts with and phosphorylates 
      CUG-BP/hNab50 protein in vitro. DMPK-mediated phosphorylation of CUG-BP/hNab50 
      results in dramatic reduction of the CUG-BP2, hypophosphorylated isoform, 
      accumulation of which was observed in the nuclei of DMPK knockout mice. These 
      data suggest a feedback mechanism whereby decreased levels of DMPK could alter 
      phosphorylation status of CUG-BP/hNab50, thus facilitating nuclear localization 
      of CUG-BP/hNab50. Our results suggest that DM pathophysiology could be, in part, 
      a result of sequestration of CUG-BP/hNab50 and, in part, of lowered DMPK levels, 
      which, in turn, affect processing and transport of specific subclass of mRNAs.

TI  - Myotonic dystrophy protein kinase is involved in the modulation of the Ca2+ 
      homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells.
PG  - 1440-7
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM), the most prevalent muscular disorder in adults, is 
      caused by (CTG)n-repeat expansion in a gene encoding a protein kinase (DM protein 
      kinase; DMPK) and involves changes in cytoarchitecture and ion homeostasis. To 
      obtain clues to the normal biological role of DMPK in cellular ion homeostasis, 
      we have compared the resting [Ca2+]i, the amplitude and shape of 
      depolarization-induced Ca2+ transients, and the content of ATP-driven ion pumps 
      in cultured skeletal muscle cells of wild-type and DMPK[-/-] knockout mice. In 
      vitro-differentiated DMPK[-/-] myotubes exhibit a higher resting [Ca2+]i than do 
      wild-type myotubes because of an altered open probability of voltage-dependent 
      l-type Ca2+ and Na+ channels. The mutant myotubes exhibit smaller and slower Ca2+ 
      responses upon triggering by acetylcholine or high external K+. In addition, we 
      observed that these Ca2+ transients partially result from an influx of 
      extracellular Ca2+ through the l-type Ca2+ channel. Neither the content nor the 
      activity of Na+/K+ ATPase and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase are affected by 
      DMPK absence. In conclusion, our data suggest that DMPK is involved in modulating 
      the initial events of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle.

TI  - Expansion of the myotonic dystrophy CTG repeat reduces expression of the flanking 
      DMAHP gene.
PG  - 407-9
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy, or dystrophia myotonica (DM), is a highly variable 
      multisystem disease in which the classic adult-onset form displays progressive 
      muscle wasting, cataracts, heart block, gonadal atrophy, insulin resistance and 
      neuropsychiatric impairment. Its genetic basis is an expansion of CTG 
      trinucleotide repeats in the DMPK protein kinase gene. Among the triplet repeat 
      expansion disorders, DM is distinguished by the extended length of the repeat 
      tract (5-13 kb in postmortem tissue) and its location in the 3' untranslated 
      region of the gene that contains it. The pathophysiological mechanism for 
      multisystem degeneration in DM is not understood. In contrast to the profound 
      muscle wasting that characterizes advanced DM, only minor histopathological 
      abnormalities have occurred in DMPK knockout mice or in mice that overexpress a 
      human DMPK transgene, making it unlikely that changes in DMPK activity provide a 
      unitary explanation for the disease. A DNAse hypersensitive site that maps 0.7 kb 
      downstream (centromeric) from the CTG repeats is eliminated on DM chromosomes. 
      This finding indicates that the repeat expansion may alter the adjacent chromatin 
      structure and raises the possibility that it may also affect the expression of 
      flanking genes. An interesting candidate flanking gene is DMAHP, a recently 
      discovered homeodomain-encoding gene. We show here that DMAHP expression in 
      myoblasts, muscle and myocardium is reduced by the DM mutation is cis, and the 
      magnitude of this effect depends on the extent of CTG repeat expansion. These 
      observations support the hypothesis that DMAHP participates in the 
      pathophysiology of DM.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat expansion at the myotonic dystrophy locus reduces expression 
      of DMAHP.
PG  - 402-6
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy, or dystrophia myotonica (DM), is an autosomal dominant 
      multisystem disorder caused by the expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 
      3' untranslated region of the DMPK protein kinase gene on chromosome 19q13.3 
      (refs 1-3). Although the DM mutation was identified more than five years ago, the 
      pathogenic mechanisms underlying this most prevalent form of hereditary adult 
      neuromuscular disease remain elusive. Previous work from our laboratory 
      demonstrated that a DNase l-hypersensitive site located adjacent to the repeats 
      on the wild-type allele is eliminated by repeat expansion, indicating that large 
      CTG-repeat arrays may be associated with a local chromatin environment that 
      represses gene expression. Here we report that the hypersensitive site contains 
      an enhancer element that regulates transcription of the adjacent DMAHP homeobox 
      gene. Analysis of DMAHP expression in the cells of DM patients with loss of the 
      hypersensitive site revealed a two- to fourfold reduction in steady-state DMAHP 
      transcript levels relative to wild-type controls. Allele-specific analysis of 
      DMAHP expression showed that steady-state transcript levels from the expanded 
      allele were greatly reduced in comparison to those from the wild-type allele. 
      Together, these results demonstrate that CTG-repeat expansions can suppress local 
      gene expression and implicate DMAHP in DM pathogenesis.

PG  - 7388-93
AB  - Expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of 
      DMPK, the gene encoding myotonic dystrophy protein kinase, induces the dominantly 
      inherited neuromuscular disorder myotonic dystrophy (DM). Transcripts containing 
      the expanded trinucleotide are abundant in differentiated cultured myoblasts, and 
      they are spliced and polyadenylylated normally. However, mutant transcripts never 
      reach the cytoplasm in these nonmitotic cells; instead, they form stable clusters 
      that are tightly linked to the nuclear matrix, which can prevent effective 
      biochemical purification of these transcripts. In DM patients, reduced DMPK 
      protein levels, consequent to nuclear retention of mutant transcripts, are 
      probably a cause of disease development. Formation of nuclear foci is a novel 
      mechanism for preventing transcript export and effecting a loss of gene function.

TI  - Identification of a (CUG)n triplet repeat RNA-binding protein and its expression 
      in myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 4407-14
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disease that is 
      associated with a (CTG)n repeat expansion in the 3'-untranslated region of the 
      myotonin protein kinase (Mt-PK) gene. This study reports the isolation and 
      characterization of a (CUG)n triplet repeat pre-mRNA/mRNA binding protein that 
      may play an important role in DM pathogenesis. Two HeLa cell proteins, CUG-BP1 
      and CUG-BP2, have been purified based upon their ability to bind specifically to 
      (CUG)8 oligonucleotides in vitro. While CUG-BP1 is the major (CUG)8-binding 
      activity in normal cells, nuclear CUG-BP2 binding activity increases in DM cells. 
      Both CUG-BP1 and CUG-BP2 have been identified as isoforms of a novel 
      heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP), hNab50. The CUG-BP/hNab50 
      protein is localized predominantly in the nucleus and is associated with 
      polyadenylated RNAs in vivo. In vitro RNA-binding/photocrosslinking studies 
      demonstrate that CUG-BP/hNab50 binds to RNAs containing the Mt-PK 3'-UTR. We 
      propose that the (CUG)n repeat region in Mt-PK mRNA is a binding site for 
      CUG-BP/hNab50 in vivo, and triplet repeat expansion leads to sequestration of 
      this hnRNP on mutant Mt-PK transcripts.

TI  - Myotonic dystrophy phenotype without expansion of (CTG)n repeat: an entity 
      distinct from proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM)?
PG  - 715-21
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is associated with an expansion of an unstable (CTG)n 
      repeat in the 3' untranslated region of the DM protein kinase (DMPK) gene on 
      chromosome 19q13.3. We studied six patients from two families who showed no 
      expansions of the repeat, in spite of their clinical diagnosis of DM. These 
      patients had multi-systemic manifestations that were distinguishable from those 
      seen in other myotonic disorders, including proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM). 
      In one additional family, two symptomatic members showed no expanded (CTG)n 
      repeats, while their affected relatives had the expanded repeats. DM haplotype 
      analysis failed to exclude the DMPK locus as a possible site of mutation in each 
      family; however, DMPK mRNA levels were normal. We conclude that a mutation(s) 
      other than the expanded (CTG)n repeat can cause the DM phenotype. The mutation(s) 
      in these families remain(s) to be mapped and characterized.

TI  - Abnormal myotonic dystrophy protein kinase levels produce only mild myopathy in 
      mice.
PG  - 316-24
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is commonly associated with CTG repeat expansions within 
      the gene for DM-protein kinase (DMPK). The effect of altered expression levels of 
      DMPK, which is ubiquitously expressed in all muscle cell lineages during 
      development, was examined by disrupting the endogenous Dmpk gene and 
      overexpressing a normal human DMPK transgene in mice. Nullizygous (-/-) mice 
      showed only inconsistent and minor size changes in head and neck muscle fibres at 
      older age, animals with the highest DMPK transgene expression showed hypertrophic 
      cardiomyopathy and enhanced neonatal mortality. However, both models lack other 
      frequent DM symptoms including the fibre-type dependent atrophy, myotonia, 
      cataract and male-infertility. These results strengthen the contention that 
      simple loss- or gain-of-expression of DMPK is not the only crucial requirement 
      for development of the disease.

TI  - Segregation distortion of the CTG repeats at the myotonic dystrophy locus.
PG  - 109-18
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM), an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disease, is caused 
      by a CTG-repeat expansion, with affected individuals having > or = 50 repeats of 
      this trinucleotide, at the DMPK locus of human chromosome 19q13.3. Severely 
      affected individuals die early in life; the milder form of this disease reduces 
      reproductive ability. Alleles in the normal range of CTG repeats are not as 
      unstable as the (CTG)(> or = 50) alleles. In the DM families, anticipation and 
      parental bias of allelic expansions have been noted. However, data on mechanism 
      of maintenance of DM in populations are conflicting. We present a 
      maximum-likelihood model for examining segregation distortion of CTG-repeat 
      alleles in normal families. Analyzing 726 meiotic events in 95 nuclear families 
      from the CEPH panel pedigrees, we find evidence of preferential transmission of 
      larger alleles (of size < or = 29 repeats) from females (the probability of 
      transmission of larger alleles is .565 +/- 0.03, different from .5 at P 
      approximately equal .028). There is no evidence of segregation distortion during 
      male meiosis. We propose a hypothesis that preferential transmission of larger 
      CTG-repeat alleles during female meiosis can compensate for mutational 
      contraction of repeats within the normal allelic size range, and reduced 
      viability and fertility of affected individuals. Thus, the pool of premutant 
      alleles at the DM locus can be maintained in populations, which can subsequently 
      mutate to the full mutation status to give rise to DM.

TI  - Reduction of serum IgG level and peripheral T-cell counts are correlated with CTG 
      repeat lengths in myotonic dystrophy patients.
PG  - 203-10
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder associated 
      with expansion of the CTG repeat within the 3' non-coding region of the myotonin 
      protein kinase (MT-PK) gene. CTG repeat length has been shown to correlate with 
      the clinical category and age at onset of the disease. The relationship between 
      CTG repeat length and immunological parameters were analyzed in this study. We 
      determined CTG repeat length in 14 DM patients and 15 normal controls using 
      Southern and PCR analyses, and then correlated their CTG repeat lengths with 
      their serum immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, IgM) levels and the number of peripheral 
      white blood cells, including lymphocyte subsets. In DM patients, increasing CTG 
      repeat lengths correlated significantly with decreasing serum IgG levels, 
      decreasing total lymphocyte counts, and decreasing CD2+, CD3+, and CD4+ cell 
      counts. Immunological parameters were also influenced by the expansion of CTG 
      repeat in DM patients.

TI  - A novel homeodomain-encoding gene is associated with a large CpG island 
      interrupted by the myotonic dystrophy unstable (CTG)n repeat.
PG  - 1919-25
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is associated with a (CTG)n trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in the 3'-untranslated region of a protein kinase-encoding gene, DMPK, 
      which maps to chromosome 19q13.3. Characterisation of the expression of this gene 
      in patient tissues has thus far generated conflicting data on alterations in the 
      steady state levels of DMPK mRNA, and on the final DMPK protein levels in the 
      presence of the expansion. The DM region of chromosome 19 is gene rich, and it is 
      possible that the repeat expansion may lead to dysfunction of a number of 
      transcription units in the vicinity, perhaps as a consequence of chromatin 
      disruption. We have searched for genes associated with a CpG island at the 3' end 
      of DMPK. Sequencing of this region shows that the island extends over 3.5 kb and 
      is interrupted by the (CTG)n repeat. Comparison of genomic sequences downstream 
      (centromeric) of the repeat in human and mouse identified regions of significant 
      homology. These correspond to exons of a gene predicted to encode a homeodomain 
      protein. RT-PCR analysis shows that this gene, which we have called DM 
      locus-associated homeodomain protein (DMAHP), is expressed in a number of human 
      tissues, including skeletal muscle, heart and brain.

TI  - Direct detection of expanded (CAG/CTG) repeats in the myotonin-protein kinase 
      genes of myotonic dystrophy patients using a high-stringency hybridization 
      method.
PG  - 341-6
AB  - Recent discoveries of genes containing (CAG/CTG) repeats as the causative genes 
      for neuromuscular diseases suggest that trinucleotide repeat expansions are 
      associated with a number of other neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in 
      those showing genetic anticipation. In order to efficiently identify expanded 
      trinucleotide repeats, we have developed a novel method using a single-stranded 
      probe containing (CAG)55, which allows direct detection of expanded (CAG/CTG) 
      repeats in the myotonin-protein kinase (Mt-PK) genes of patients with myotonic 
      dystrophy without the need for any prior information of chromosomal localizations 
      of the disease genes. This method is expected to be useful for identifying novel 
      genes for diseases associated with expanded (CAG/CTG) repeats.

TI  - Effect of myotonic dystrophy trinucleotide repeat expansion on DMPK transcription 
      and processing.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - The myotonic dystrophy (DM) mutation has been identified as an unstable, expanded 
      (CTG)n repeat in the 3' untranslated region of a gene designated DM protein 
      kinase (DMPK). Both decreased and increased levels of mutant DMPK mRNA as well as 
      decreased levels of protein have been variously reported and invoked to explain 
      disparate molecular bases of this dominantly inherited disease. Most recently, 
      increased nucleosome binding to such expanded repeats has been interpreted as 
      support for transcriptional repression. A quantitative allele-specific RT-PCR 
      procedure was developed and applied to a spectrum of patient tissue samples and 
      cell lines. Equal levels of unprocessed pre-mRNA were produced by the wildtype 
      (+) and disease (DM) alleles in skeletal muscle and cell lines of heterozygous DM 
      patients. Thus, any increased nucleosome binding had no effect at the level of 
      transcriptional initiation and transcription of the mutant DMPK locus. In 
      contrast, processed mRNA levels from the DM allele were reduced relative to 
      the+allele as the size of the expansion increased. The unstable repeat, 
      therefore, impairs post-transcriptional processing of DM allele transcripts. This 
      phenomenon has profound effects on overall DMPK locus steady-state transcript 
      levels in cells missing a wildtype allele and does not appear to be mediated by 
      imprinting, decreased mRNA stability, generation of aberrant splice forms, or 
      absence of polyadenylation of the mutant allele.

TI  - De novo myotonic dystrophy mutation in a Nigerian kindred.
PG  - 1067-74
AB  - An expansion of an unstable (CTG)n trinucleotide repeat in the 3' UTR of a gene 
      encoding a putative serine/threonine protein kinase (DMPK) on human chromosome 
      19q13.3 has been shown to be specific for the myotonic dystrophy (DM) disease 
      phenotype. In addition, a single haplotype composed of nine alleles within and 
      flanking DMPK over a physical distance of 30 kb has been shown to be in complete 
      linkage disequilibrium with DM. This has led to two hypotheses: (1) 
      predisposition for (CTG)n instability results from a founder effect that occurred 
      only once or a few times in human evolution; and (2) elements within the disease 
      haplotype may predispose the (CTG)n repeat to instability. A detailed haplotype 
      analysis of the DM region was conducted on a Nigerian (Yoruba) DM family, the 
      only indigenous sub-Saharan DM case reported to date. Each affected member of 
      this family had an expanded (CTG)n repeat in one of his or her DMPK alleles. 
      However, unlike all other DM populations studied thus far, disassociation of the 
      (CTG)n repeat expansion from other alleles of the putative predisposing haplotype 
      was found. We conclude that the expanded (CTG)n repeat in this family is the 
      result of an independent mutational event. Consequently, the origin of DM is 
      unlikely to be a single mutational event, and the hypothesis that a single 
      ancestral haplotype predisposes to repeat expansion is not compelling.

      expansion in the gene results in the phenotype, the severity of which is 
      proportional to the repeat length. A fluorochrome-conjugated probe (10 repeats of 
      CAG) hybridized specifically to this expanded repeat. Mt-PK transcripts 
      containing CTG repeat expansions were detected in the nucleus as bright foci in 
      DM patient fibroblasts and muscle biopsies, but not from normal individuals. 
      These foci represented transcripts from the Mt-PK gene since they simultaneously 
      hybridized to fluorochrome-conjugated probes to the 5'-end of the Mt-PK mRNA. A 
      single oligonucleotide probe to the repeat and the sense strand each conjugated 
      to different fluorochromes revealed the gene and the transcripts simultaneously, 
      and indicated that these focal concentrations (up to 13 per nucleus) represented 
      predominately posttranscriptional RNA since only a single focus contained both 
      the DNA and the RNA. This concentration of nuclear transcripts was diagnostic of 
      the affected state, and may represent aberrant processing of the RNA.

TI  - Absence of myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) mRNA as a result of a triplet 
      repeat expansion in myotonic dystrophy.
PG  - 340-8
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomally dominant inherited disease in which 
      system-wide abnormalities are caused by a triplet repeat expansion within the 3' 
      untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene. To 
      determine the effect an expanded repeat region has on DMPK expression, we have 
      separated the chromosome 19 homologues from a 36-year-old woman with myotonic 
      dystrophy into different cell lines by way of somatic cell hybridization. Hybrid 
      DM9101 contains the normal DMPK allele (13 repeats), whereas hybrid DM1115 
      harbors the mutant allele (approximately 133 repeats). Reverse 
      transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) amplification of coding 
      sequences from the DMPK gene has shown both reduced levels of primary DMPK 
      transcripts and impaired processing of these transcripts in hybrid cell line 
      DM1115. These findings suggest that the presence of a large number of repeats in 
      the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene reduces both the synthesis and the 
      processing of DMPK mRNA, resulting in undetectable levels of processed DMPK mRNA 
      from the mutant allele.
