TI  - Assessment of the Clinical Interactions of GAA Repeat Expansions in FGF14 and 
      FXN.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The number of GAA repeats in the FXN gene is a major 
      but not sole determinant of the clinical presentation of Friedreich ataxia 
      (FRDA). The objective of this study was to establish whether the length of the 
      GAA repeat tract in the FGF14 gene, which is associated with another 
      neurodegenerative disorder (SCA27B), affects the clinical presentation (age at 
      onset, mFARS score) of patients with FRDA. METHODS: The number of GAA repeats in 
      the FXN and FGF14 genes was determined using PCR in a cohort of 221 patients with 
      FRDA. Next, we compared absolute lengths of the FGF14 GAAs with FXN GAAs, 
      followed by correlative analyses to determine potential effects of FGF14 GAA 
      length on age at onset and clinical presentation (mFARS) of FRDA. RESULTS: We 
      found no significant correlation between the size of the GAA repeats in FXN and 
      FGF14 loci in our FRDA cohort. Moreover, the number of GAAs in FGF14 did not 
      affect the clinical presentation of FRDA even in a small number of cases where a 
      long FGF14 allele was present. DISCUSSION: Despite both molecular and clinical 
      similarities between FRDA and SCA27B, the length of the GAA repeats in the FGF14 
      gene, including potentially pathogenic alleles, did not influence the clinical 
      presentation of FRDA.

TI  - Screening for SCA27B, CANVAS and other repeat expansion disorders in Greek 
      patients with late-onset cerebellar ataxia suggests a need to update current 
      diagnostic algorithms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Late-onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA) is a slowly progressive cerebellar 
      disorder with symptom onset >/=30years of age. Intronic tandem repeat expansions 
      (TREs) in RFC1 and FGF14 have recently emerged as common causes of LOCA. The 
      relative contribution of classic vs. newly discovered TREs has not been 
      systematically investigated in LOCA cohorts. METHODS: Over 28 years, 206 
      consecutive Greek LOCA index patients were referred for genetic testing and, 
      based on clinical data and inheritance pattern, screened for FRDA, SCA1,2,3,6,7, 
      FXTAS, CANVAS and SCA27B. RESULTS: A genetic diagnosis was reached in 62 of 206 
      cases (30.1 %). Mean age was 60.1 +/- 11.2 (35-87) years and mean age at onset 
      (AAO) 52.5 +/- 11.4 (30-80) years. SCA27B accounted for 9.7 % of LOCA cases, CANVAS 
      for 7.8 % and FRDA for 4.4 %. The overall frequency of SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 was 
      6.8 %. No cases of SCA3 and SCA6 were identified. FXTAS contributed 1.5 % of 
      cases. In sporadic cases, the diagnostic yield was 22.8 % (34 of 149; SCA27B: 
      8.7 %, CANVAS: 8.1 %, FRDA: 2.7 %, SCA2: 1.3 %, FXTAS: 1.3 % and SCA7: 0.7 %). In 
      familial cases, the diagnostic yield was 49.1 % (28 of 57). Two cases with CANVAS 
      had pseudodominant inheritance. Patients with SCA27B, CANVAS and FXTAS had mean 
      AAO > 50 years, whereas patients with FRDA, SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 had mean 
      AAO < 50 years. CONCLUSION: Recently-discovered TREs causing SCA27B and CANVAS 
      represent the commonest known genetic causes of LOCA. Prioritizing testing for 
      FGF14 and RFC1 expansions in the diagnostic algorithm of LOCA is recommended.

TI  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 27B (SCA27B): A Hereditary Ataxia in Portugal.
LID - 10.20344/amp.22232 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 27B (SCA27B) is a recently discovered hereditary 
      disease caused by (GAA)>/=250 repeat expansion in the fibroblast growth factor 14 
      (FGF14) gene, and multiple studies have recognized it as one of the most common 
      causes of autosomal dominant ataxia in the European population. We present the 
      case of a 62-year-old Portuguese patient who developed a slowly progressive gait 
      impairment associated with wide-base ataxic gait, dysarthria, left upper limb 
      dysmetria, and dysdiadochokinesia. This pure cerebellar phenotype had an episodic 
      worsening induced by intense physical activity and alcohol intake. The patient 
      had an older brother with a late-onset cerebellar ataxia of unknown cause. 
      Genetic testing detected a heterozygotic intronic FGF14 repeat expansion with 
      complete penetrance (> 360 repeats), confirming the diagnosis of SCA27B. To our 
      knowledge, we present the first reported case of SCA27B in the Portuguese 
      population.

TI  - Somatic instability of the FGF14-SCA27B GAA*TTC repeat reveals a marked expansion 
      bias in the cerebellum.
LID - awae312 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/brain/awae312 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 27B (SCA27B) is a common autosomal dominant ataxia caused 
      by an intronic GAA*TTC repeat expansion in FGF14. Neuropathological studies have 
      shown that neuronal loss is largely restricted to the cerebellum. Although the 
      repeat locus is highly unstable during intergenerational transmission, it remains 
      unknown whether it exhibits cerebral mosaicism and progressive instability 
      throughout life. We conducted an analysis of the FGF14 GAA*TTC repeat somatic 
      instability across 156 serial blood samples from 69 individuals, fibroblasts, 
      induced pluripotent stem cells, and post-mortem brain tissues from six controls 
      and six patients with SCA27B, alongside methylation profiling using targeted 
      long-read sequencing. Peripheral tissues exhibited minimal somatic instability, 
      which did not significantly change over periods of more than 20 years. In 
      post-mortem brains, the GAA*TTC repeat was remarkably stable across all regions, 
      except in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis. The levels of somatic expansion 
      in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis were, on average, 3.15 and 2.72 times 
      greater relative to other examined brain regions, respectively. Additionally, 
      levels of somatic expansion in the brain increased with repeat length and tissue 
      expression of FGF14. We found no significant difference in methylation of 
      wild-type and expanded FGF14 alleles in post-mortem cerebellar hemispheres 
      between patients and controls. In conclusion, our study revealed that the FGF14 
      GAA*TTC repeat exhibits a cerebellar-specific expansion bias, which may explain 
      the pure cerebellar involvement in SCA27B.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Spinocerebellar ataxia 27B due to GAA repeat expansions in the 
      fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) gene has recently been recognized as a common 
      cause of late-onset hereditary cerebellar ataxia. Here we present the first 
      report of this disease in the US population, characterizing its clinical 
      manifestations, disease progression, pathological abnormalities, and response to 
      4-aminopyridine in a cohort of 102 patients bearing GAA repeat expansions. 
      METHODS: We compiled a series of patients with SCA27B, recruited from 5 academic 
      centers across the United States. Clinical manifestations and patient 
      demographics were collected retrospectively from clinical records in an unblinded 
      approach using a standardized form. Post-mortem analysis was done on 4 brains of 
      patients with genetically confirmed SCA27B. RESULTS: In our cohort of 102 
      patients with SCA27B, we found that SCA27B was a late-onset (57 +/- 12.5 years) 
      slowly progressive ataxia with an episodic component in 51% of patients. Balance 
      and gait impairment were almost always present at disease onset. The principal 
      finding on post-mortem examination of 4 brain specimens was loss of Purkinje 
      neurons that was most severe in the vermis most particularly in the anterior 
      vermis. Similar to European populations, a high percent of patients 21/28 (75%) 
      reported a positive treatment response with 4-aminopyridine. INTERPRETATION: Our 
      study further estimates prevalence and further expands the clinical, imaging and 
      pathological features of SCA27B, while looking at treatment response, disease 
      progression, and survival in patients with this disease. Testing for SCA27B 
      should be considered in all undiagnosed ataxia patients, especially those with 
      episodic onset. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:1092-1103.

AB  - Repeat expansions in FGF14 cause autosomal dominant late-onset cerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA27B) with estimated pathogenic thresholds of 250 (incomplete penetrance) and 
      300 AAG repeats (full penetrance), but the sequence of pathogenic and 
      non-pathogenic expansions remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that STRling 
      and ExpansionHunter accurately detect FGF14 expansions from short-read genome 
      data using outlier approaches. By combining long-range PCR and nanopore 
      sequencing in 169 patients with cerebellar ataxia and 802 controls, we compare 
      FGF14 expansion alleles, including interruptions and flanking regions. 
      Uninterrupted AAG expansions are significantly enriched in patients with ataxia 
      from a lower threshold (180-200 repeats) than previously reported based on 
      expansion size alone. Conversely, AAGGAG hexameric expansions are equally 
      frequent in patients and controls. Distinct 5' flanking regions, interruptions 
      and pre-repeat sequences correlate with repeat size. Furthermore, pure AAG 
      (pathogenic) and AAGGAG (non-pathogenic) repeats form different secondary 
      structures. Regardless of expansion size, SCA27B is a recognizable clinical 
      entity characterized by frequent episodic ataxia and downbeat nystagmus, similar 
      to the presentation observed in a family with a previously unreported nonsense 
      variant (SCA27A). Overall, this study suggests that SCA27B is a major overlooked 
      cause of adult-onset ataxia, accounting for 23-31% of unsolved patients. We 
      strongly recommend re-evaluating pathogenic thresholds and integrating expansion 
      sequencing into the molecular diagnostic process.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive, 
      adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by combinations 
      of autonomic failure, parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia and pyramidal signs. 
      Although a few genetic factors have been reported to contribute to the disease, 
      its mutational profiles have not been systemically studied. METHODS: To address 
      the genetic profiles of clinically diagnosed MSA patients, exome sequencing and 
      triplet repeat detection was conducted in 205 MSA patients, including one 
      familial case. The pathogenicity of variants was determined according to the 
      American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for 
      Molecular Pathology guidelines. RESULTS: In the familial patient, a novel 
      heterozygous COQ2 pathogenic variant (p.Ala351Thr) was identified in the MSA 
      pedigree. In the sporadic patients, 29 pathogenic variants were revealed in 21 
      genes, and the PARK7 p.Ala104Thr variant was significantly associated with MSA 
      (p = 0.0018). Moreover, burden tests demonstrated that the pathogenic variants 
      were enriched in cerebellar ataxia-related genes in patients. Furthermore, repeat 
      expansion analyses revealed that two patients carried the pathogenic CAG repeat 
      expansion in the CACNA1A gene (SCA6), one patient carried the 
      (ACAGG)exp/(ACAGG)exp expansion in RFC1 and one carried the GAA-pure expansion in 
      FGF14 gene. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, a novel COQ2 pathogenic variant was 
      identified in a familial MSA patient, and repeat expansions in CACNA1A, RFC1 and 
      FGF14 gene were detected in four sporadic patients. Moreover, a PARK7 variant and 
      the burden of pathogenic variants in cerebellar ataxia-related genes were 
      associated with MSA.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 27B (SCA27B) is a common autosomal dominant ataxia caused 
      by an intronic GAA*TTC repeat expansion in FGF14 . Neuropathological studies have 
      shown that neuronal loss is largely restricted to the cerebellum. Although the 
      repeat locus is highly unstable during intergenerational transmission, it remains 
      unknown whether it exhibits cerebral mosaicism and progressive instability 
      throughout life. We conducted an analysis of the FGF14 GAA*TTC repeat somatic 
      instability across 156 serial blood samples from 69 individuals, fibroblasts, 
      induced pluripotent stem cells, and post-mortem brain tissues from six controls 
      and six patients with SCA27B, alongside methylation profiling using targeted 
      long-read sequencing. Peripheral tissues exhibited minimal somatic instability, 
      which did not significantly change over periods of more than 20 years. In 
      post-mortem brains, the GAA*TTC repeat was remarkably stable across all regions, 
      except in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis. The levels of somatic expansion 
      in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis were, on average, 3.15 and 2.72 times 
      greater relative to other examined brain regions, respectively. Additionally, 
      levels of somatic expansion in the brain increased with repeat length and tissue 
      expression of FGF14 . We found no significant difference in methylation of 
      wild-type and expanded FGF14 alleles in post-mortem cerebellar hemispheres 
      between patients and controls. In conclusion, our study revealed that the FGF14 
      GAA*TTC repeat exhibits a cerebellar-specific expansion bias, which may explain 
      the pure and late-onset cerebellar involvement in SCA27B.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 27B (SCA27B) in India: insights from a large cohort 
      study suggest ancient origin.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ethnic diversity of India provides a unique opportunity to study 
      the history of the origin of mutations of genetic disorders. Spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 27B (SCA27B), a recently identified dominantly inherited cerebellar 
      disorder is caused by GAA-repeat expansions in intron 1 of Fibroblast Growth 
      Factor 14 (FGF14). Predominantly reported in the European population, we aimed to 
      screen this mutation and study the founder haplotype of SCA27B in Indian ataxia 
      patients. METHODS: We have undertaken screening of GAA repeats in a large Indian 
      cohort of ~ 1400 uncharacterised ataxia patients and kindreds and long-read 
      sequencing-based GAA repeat length assessment. High throughput genotyping-based 
      haplotype analysis was also performed. We utilized ~ 1000 Indian genomes to study 
      the GAA at-risk expansion alleles. FINDINGS: We report a high frequency of 1.83% 
      (n = 23) of SCA27B in the uncharacterized Indian ataxia cohort. We observed 
      several biallelic GAA expansion mutations (n = 5) with younger disease onset. We 
      observed a risk haplotype (AATCCGTGG) flanking the FGF14-GAA locus over a 74 kb 
      region in linkage disequilibrium. We further studied the frequency of this risk 
      haplotype across diverse geographical population groups. The highest prevalence 
      of the risk haplotype was observed in the European population (29.9%) followed by 
      Indians (21.5%). The observed risk haplotype has existed through ~ 1100 
      generations (~ 22,000 years), assuming a correlated genealogy. INTERPRETATION: 
      This study provides valuable insights into SCA27B and its Upper Paleolithic 
      origin in the Indian subcontinent. The high occurrence of biallelic expansion is 
      probably relevant to the endogamous nature of the Indian population.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 27B: a frequent and slowly progressive autosomal-dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia-experience from an Italian cohort.
PG  - 5478-5488
LID - 10.1007/s00415-024-12506-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (ADCA) due to intronic GAA 
      repeat expansion in FGF14 (SCA27B) is a recent, relatively common form of 
      late-onset ataxia. OBJECTIVE: Here, we aimed to: (1) investigate the relative 
      frequency of SCA27B in different clinically defined disease subgroups with 
      late-onset ataxia collected among 16 tertiary Italian centers; (2) characterize 
      phenotype and diagnostic findings of patients with SCA27B; (3) compare the 
      Italian cohort with other cohorts reported in recent studies. METHODS: We 
      screened 396 clinically diagnosed late-onset cerebellar ataxias of unknown cause, 
      subdivided in sporadic cerebellar ataxia, ADCA, and multisystem atrophy 
      cerebellar type. We identified 72 new genetically defined subjects with SCA27B. 
      Then, we analyzed the clinical, neurophysiological, and imaging features of 64 
      symptomatic cases. RESULTS: In our cohort, the prevalence of SCA27B was 13.4% 
      (53/396) with as high as 38.5% (22/57) in ADCA. The median age of onset of SCA27B 
      patients was 62 years. All symptomatic individuals showed evidence of impaired 
      balance and gait; cerebellar ocular motor signs were also frequent. Episodic 
      manifestations at onset occurred in 31% of patients. Extrapyramidal features 
      (17%) and cognitive impairment (25%) were also reported. Brain magnetic resonance 
      imaging showed cerebellar atrophy in most cases (78%). Pseudo-longitudinal 
      assessments indicated slow progression of ataxia and minimal functional 
      impairment. CONCLUSION: Patients with SCA27B in Italy present as an adult-onset, 
      slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia with predominant axial involvement and 
      frequent cerebellar ocular motor signs. The high consistency of clinical features 
      in SCA27B cohorts in multiple populations paves the way toward large-scale, 
      multicenter studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intronic GAA repeat expansion ([GAA] >/=250) in FGF14 is associated 
      with the late-onset neurodegenerative disorder, spinocerebellar ataxia 27B 
      (SCA27B, GAA-FGF14 ataxia). We aim to determine the prevalence of the GAA repeat 
      expansion in FGF14 in Chinese populations presenting late-onset cerebellar ataxia 
      (LOCA) and evaluate the characteristics of tandem repeat inheritance, 
      radiological features and sympathetic nerve involvement. METHODS: GAA-FGF14 
      repeat expansion was screened in an undiagnosed LOCA cohort (n = 664) and 
      variations in repeat-length were analyzed in families of confirmed GAA-FGF14 
      ataxia patients. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate the 
      radiological feature in GAA-FGF14 ataxia patients. Clinical examinations and 
      sympathetic skin response (SSR) recordings in GAA-FGF14 patients (n = 16) were 
      used to quantify sympathetic nerve involvement. RESULTS: Two unrelated probands 
      (2/664) were identified. Genetic screening for GAA-FGF14 repeat expansion was 
      performed in 39 family members, 16 of whom were genetically diagnosed with 
      GAA-FGF14 ataxia. Familial screening revealed expansion of GAA repeats in 
      maternal transmissions, but contraction upon paternal transmission. Brain MRI 
      showed slight to moderate cerebellar atrophy. SSR amplitude was lower in 
      GAA-FGF14 patients in pre-symptomatic stage compared to healthy controls, and 
      further decreased in the symptomatic stage. CONCLUSIONS: GAA-FGF14 ataxia was 
      rare among Chinese LOCA cases. Parental gender appears to affect variability in 
      GAA repeat number between generations. Reduced SSR amplitude is a prominent 
      feature in GAA-FGF14 patients, even in the pre-symptomatic stage.

TI  - Complete nanopore repeat sequencing of SCA27B (GAA-FGF14 ataxia) in Japanese.
PG  - 1187-1195
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2024-333541 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although pure GAA expansion is considered pathogenic in SCA27B, 
      non-GAA repeat motif is mostly mixed into longer repeat sequences. This study 
      aimed to unravel the complete sequencing of FGF14 repeat expansion to elucidate 
      its repeat motifs and pathogenicity. METHODS: We screened FGF14 repeat expansion 
      in a Japanese cohort of 460 molecularly undiagnosed adult-onset cerebellar ataxia 
      patients and 1022 controls, together with 92 non-Japanese controls, and performed 
      nanopore sequencing of FGF14 repeat expansion. RESULTS: In the Japanese 
      population, the GCA motif was predominantly observed as the non-GAA motif, 
      whereas the GGA motif was frequently detected in non-Japanese controls. The 
      5'-common flanking variant was observed in all Japanese GAA repeat alleles within 
      normal length, demonstrating its meiotic stability against repeat expansion. In 
      both patients and controls, pure GAA repeat was up to 400 units in length, 
      whereas non-pathogenic GAA-GCA repeat was larger, up to 900 units, but they 
      evolved from different haplotypes, as rs534066520, located just upstream of the 
      repeat sequence, completely discriminated them. Both (GAA)(>/=250) and (GAA)(>/=200) 
      were enriched in patients, whereas (GAA-GCA)(>/=200) was similarly observed in 
      patients and controls, suggesting the pathogenic threshold of (GAA)(>/=200) for 
      cerebellar ataxia. We identified 14 patients with SCA27B (3.0%), but their 
      single-nucleotide polymorphism genotype indicated different founder alleles 
      between Japanese and Caucasians. The low prevalence of SCA27B in Japanese may be 
      due to the lower allele frequency of (GAA)(>/=250) in the Japanese population than 
      in Caucasians (0.15% vs 0.32%-1.26%). CONCLUSIONS: FGF14 repeat expansion has 
      unique features of pathogenicity and allelic origin, as revealed by a single 
      ethnic study.

TI  - The genetic landscape and phenotypic spectrum of GAA-FGF14 ataxia in China: a 
      large cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An intronic GAA repeat expansion in FGF14 was recently identified as 
      a cause of GAA-FGF14 ataxia. We aimed to characterise the frequency and 
      phenotypic profile of GAA-FGF14 ataxia in a large Chinese ataxia cohort. METHODS: 
      A total of 1216 patients that included 399 typical late-onset cerebellar ataxia 
      (LOCA), 290 early-onset cerebellar ataxia (EOCA), and 527 multiple system atrophy 
      with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-c) were enrolled. Long-range and 
      repeat-primed PCR were performed to screen for GAA expansions in FGF14. Targeted 
      long-read and whole-genome sequencing were performed to determine repeat size and 
      sequence configuration. A multi-modal study including clinical assessment, MRI, 
      and neurofilament light chain was conducted for disease assessment. FINDINGS: 17 
      GAA-FGF14 positive patients with a (GAA)(>/=250) expansion (12 patients with a 
      GAA-pure expansion, five patients with a (GAA)(>/=250)-[(GAA)(n) (GCA)(m)](z) 
      expansion) and two possible patients with biallelic (GAA)(202/222) alleles were 
      identified. The clinical phenotypes of the 19 positive and possible positive 
      cases covered LOCA phenotype, EOCA phenotype and MSA-c phenotype. Five of six 
      patients with EOCA phenotype were found to have another genetic disorder. The NfL 
      levels of patients with EOCA and MSA-c phenotypes were significantly higher than 
      patients with LOCA phenotype and age-matched controls (p < 0.001). NfL levels of 
      pre-ataxic GAA-FGF14 positive individuals were lower than pre-ataxic SCA3 
      (p < 0.001) and similar to controls. INTERPRETATION: The frequency of GAA-FGF14 
      expansion in a large Chinese LOCA cohort was low (1.3%). Biallelic (GAA)(202/222) 
      alleles and co-occurrence with other acquired or hereditary diseases may 
      contribute to phenotypic variation and different progression. FUNDING: This study 
      was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (2021YFA0805200 to H.J.), the

TI  - RFC1 and FGF14 Repeat Expansions in Serbian Patients with Cerebellar Ataxia.
PG  - 626-633
LID - 10.1002/mdc3.14020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The newly discovered intronic repeat expansions in the genes encoding 
      replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) and fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) 
      frequently cause late-onset cerebellar ataxia. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the 
      presence of RFC1 and FGF14 pathogenic repeat expansions in Serbian patients with 
      adult-onset cerebellar ataxia. METHODS: The study included 167 unrelated patients 
      with sporadic or familial cerebellar ataxia. The RFC1 repeat expansion analysis 
      was performed by duplex PCR and Sanger sequencing, while the FGF14 repeat 
      expansion was tested for by long-range PCR, repeat-primed PCR, and Sanger 
      sequencing. RESULTS: We identified pathogenic repeat expansions in RFC1 in seven 
      patients (7/167; 4.2%) with late-onset sporadic ataxia with neuropathy and 
      chronic cough. Two patients also had bilateral vestibulopathy. Repeat expansions 
      in FGF14 were found in nine unrelated patients (9/167; 5.4%) with ataxia, less 
      than half of whom presented with neuropathy and two-thirds with global brain 
      atrophy. Tremor and episodic features were the most frequent additional 
      characteristics in carriers of uninterrupted FGF14 repeat expansions. Among the 
      122 sporadic cases, 12 (9.8%) carried an expansion in either RFC1 or FGF14, 
      comparable to 4/45 (8.9%) among the patients with a positive family history. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Pathogenic repeat expansions in RFC1 and FGF14 are relatively 
      frequent causes of adult-onset cerebellar ataxia, especially among sporadic 
      patients, indicating that family history should not be considered when 
      prioritizing ataxia patients for testing of RFC1 or FGF14 repeat expansions.

TI  - Neuroradiological findings in GAA-FGF14 ataxia (SCA27B): more than cerebellar 
      atrophy.
LID - 2024.02.16.24302945 [pii]
LID - 10.1101/2024.02.16.24302945 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: GAA-FGF14 ataxia (SCA27B) is a recently reported late-onset ataxia 
      caused by a GAA repeat expansion in intron 1 of the FGF14 gene. Initial studies 
      revealed cerebellar atrophy in 74-97% of patients. A more detailed brain imaging 
      characterization of GAA-FGF14 ataxia is now needed to provide supportive 
      diagnostic features and earlier disease recognition. METHODS: We performed a 
      retrospective review of the brain MRIs of 35 patients (median age at MRI 63 
      years; range 28-88 years) from Quebec (n=27), Nancy (n=3), Perth (n=3) and 
      Bengaluru (n=2) to assess the presence of atrophy in vermis, cerebellar 
      hemispheres, brainstem, cerebral hemispheres, and corpus callosum, as well as 
      white matter involvement. Following the identification of the superior cerebellar 
      peduncles (SCPs) involvement, we verified its presence in 54 GAA-FGF14 ataxia 
      patients from four independent cohorts (Tubingen n=29; Donostia n=12; Innsbruck 
      n=7; Cantabria n=6). To assess lobular atrophy, we performed quantitative 
      cerebellar segmentation in 5 affected subjects with available 3D T1-weighted 
      images and matched controls. RESULTS: Cerebellar atrophy was documented in 33 
      subjects (94.3%). We observed SCP involvement in 22 subjects (62.8%) and 
      confirmed this finding in 30/54 (55.6%) subjects from the validation cohorts. 
      Cerebellar segmentation showed reduced mean volumes of lobules X and IV in the 5 
      affected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebellar atrophy is a key feature of 
      GAA-FGF14 ataxia. The frequent SCP involvement observed in different cohorts may 
      facilitate the diagnosis. The predominant involvement of lobule X correlates with 
      the frequently observed downbeat nystagmus.

TI  - RFC1 repeat expansions in downbeat nystagmus syndromes: frequency and phenotypic 
      profile.
PG  - 2886-2892
LID - 10.1007/s00415-024-12229-z [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The cause of downbeat nystagmus (DBN) remains unknown in a 
      substantial number of patients ("idiopathic"), although intronic GAA expansions 
      in FGF14 have recently been shown to account for almost 50% of yet idiopathic 
      cases. Here, we hypothesized that biallelic RFC1 expansions may also represent a 
      recurrent cause of DBN syndrome. METHODS: We genotyped the RFC1 repeat and 
      performed in-depth phenotyping in 203 patients with DBN, including 65 patients 
      with idiopathic DBN, 102 patients carrying an FGF14 GAA expansion, and 36 
      patients with presumed secondary DBN. RESULTS: Biallelic RFC1 AAGGG expansions 
      were identified in 15/65 patients with idiopathic DBN (23%). None of the 102 
      GAA-FGF14-positive patients, but 2/36 (6%) of patients with presumed secondary 
      DBN carried biallelic RFC1 expansions. The DBN syndrome in RFC1-positive patients 
      was characterized by additional cerebellar impairment in 100% (15/15), bilateral 
      vestibulopathy (BVP) in 100% (15/15), and polyneuropathy in 80% (12/15) of cases. 
      Compared to GAA-FGF14-positive and genetically unexplained patients, 
      RFC1-positive patients had significantly more frequent neuropathic features on 
      examination and BVP. Furthermore, vestibular function, as measured by the video 
      head impulse test, was significantly more impaired in RFC1-positive patients. 
      DISCUSSION: Biallelic RFC1 expansions are a common monogenic cause of DBN 
      syndrome.

TI  - The FGF14 GAA repeat expansion in Greek patients with late-onset cerebellar 
      ataxia and an overview of the SCA27B phenotype across populations.
PG  - 446-452
LID - 10.1111/cge.14482 [doi]
AB  - A pathogenic GAA repeat expansion in the first intron of the fibroblast growth 
      factor 14 gene (FGF14) has been recently identified as the cause of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 27B (SCA27B). We herein screened 160 Greek index cases 
      with late-onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA) for FGF14 repeat expansions using a 
      combination of long-range PCR and bidirectional repeat-primed PCRs. We identified 
      19 index cases (12%) carrying a pathogenic FGF14 GAA expansion, a diagnostic 
      yield higher than that of previously screened repeat-expansion ataxias in Greek 
      LOCA patients. The age at onset of SCA27B patients was 60.5 +/- 12.3 years (range, 
      34-80). Episodic onset (37%), downbeat nystagmus (32%) and vertigo (26%) were 
      significantly more frequent in FGF14 expansion-positive cases compared to 
      expansion-negative cases. Beyond typical cerebellar signs, SCA27B patients often 
      displayed hyperreflexia (47%) and reduced vibration sense in the lower 
      extremities (42%). The frequency and phenotypic profile of SCA27B in Greek 
      patients was similar to most other previously studied populations. We conclude 
      that FGF14 GAA repeat expansions are the commonest known genetic cause of LOCA in 
      the Greek population and recommend prioritizing testing for FGF14 expansions in 
      the diagnostic algorithm of patients with LOCA.

TI  - Paroxysmal Ataxia: A Characteristic Feature of FGF14 Repeat Expansion (SCA27B).
PG  - e200118

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Paroxysmal ataxia is typically characterized by early-onset attacks 
      of cerebellar ataxia. Late-onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA) comprises a group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders mainly characterized by adult-onset progressive 
      cerebellar ataxia. A deep intronic expansion of a GAA triplet in the FGF14 gene 
      encoding fibroblast growth factor 14 has recently been identified as a frequent 
      cause of LOCA. METHODS: We describe a patient with paroxysmal ataxia/dysarthria 
      due to a FGF14 repeat expansion and 3 affected family members. RESULTS: The 4 
      patients had paroxysmal ataxia/dysarthria occurring between 45 and 50 years as 
      the initial manifestation of a FGF14 repeat expansion. The index case was 
      investigated in detail. We have provided a video showing one of her paroxysmal 
      episodes that could be triggered by alcohol, coffee, exertion, emotion, or 
      cigarette smoking. Brain MRI revealed mild cerebellar atrophy, and oculography 
      showed a subclinical downbeat nystagmus. Treatment with acetazolamide resulted in 
      remarkable improvement. DISCUSSION: Paroxysmal dysarthria/ataxia should prompt 
      the clinician to test for FGF14 repeat expansion/SCA27B, especially when the 
      paroxysmal attacks are associated with late-onset cerebellar ataxia and/or a 
      family history consistent with a dominant disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SCA27B caused by FGF14 intronic heterozygous GAA expansions with at 
      least 250 repeats accounts for 10-60% of cases with unresolved cerebellar ataxia. 
      We aimed to assess the size and frequency of FGF14 expanded alleles in 
      individuals with cerebellar ataxia as compared with controls and to characterize 
      genetic and clinical variability. METHODS: We sized this repeat in 1876 
      individuals from France sampled for research purposes in this cross-sectional 
      study: 845 index cases with cerebellar ataxia and 324 affected relatives, 475 
      controls, as well as 119 cases with spastic paraplegia, and 113 with familial 
      essential tremor. FINDINGS: A higher frequency of expanded allele carriers in 
      index cases with ataxia was significant only above 300 GAA repeats (10.1%, 
      n = 85) compared with controls (1.1%, n = 5) (p < 0.0001) whereas GAA(250-299) 
      alleles were detected in 1.7% of both groups. Eight of 14 index cases with 
      GAA(250-299) repeats had other causal pathogenic variants (4/14) and/or 
      discordance of co-segregation (5/14), arguing against GAA causality. We compared 
      the clinical signs in 127 GAA(>/=300) carriers to cases with non-expanded GAA 
      ataxia resulting in defining a key phenotype triad: onset after 45 years, 
      downbeat nystagmus, episodic ataxic features including diplopia; and a frequent 
      absence of dysarthria. All maternally transmitted alleles above 100 GAA were 
      unstable with a median expansion of +18 repeats per generation (r(2) = 0.44; 
      p < 0.0001). In comparison, paternally transmitted alleles above 100 GAA mostly 
      decreased in size (-15 GAA (r(2) = 0.63; p < 0.0001)), resulting in the 
      transmission bias observed in SCA27B pedigrees. INTERPRETATION: SCA27B diagnosis 
      must consider both the phenotype and GAA expansion size. In carriers of 
      GAA(250-299) repeats, the absence of documented familial transmission and a 
      presentation deviating from the key SCA27B phenotype, should prompt the search 
      for an alternative cause. Affected fathers have a reduced risk of having affected 
      children, which has potential implications for genetic counseling. FUNDING: This

TI  - Copy Number Variant Analysis of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Genes in a Cohort of Dutch 
      Patients With Cerebellar Ataxia.
PG  - e200050
LID - 10.1212/NXG.0000000000200050 [doi]
LID - e200050
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a genetically 
      heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders generally caused by single 
      nucleotide variants (SNVs) or indels in coding regions or by repeat expansions in 
      coding and noncoding regions of SCA genes. Copy number variants (CNVs) have now 
      also been reported for 3 genes-ITPR1, FGF14, and SPTBN2-but not all SCA genes 
      have been screened for CNVs as the underlying cause of the disease in patients. 
      In this study, we aim to assess the prevalence of CNVs encompassing 36 known SCA 
      genes. METHODS: A cohort of patients with cerebellar ataxia who were referred to 
      the University Medical Center Groningen for SCA genetic diagnostics was selected 
      for this study. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was 
      performed using the Infinium Global Screening Array. Following data processing, 
      genotyping data were uploaded into NxClinical software to perform CNV analysis 
      per patient and to visualize identified CNVs in 36 genes with allocated SCA 
      symbols. The clinical relevance of detected CNVs was determined using evidence 
      from studies based on PubMed literature searches for similar CNVs and phenotypic 
      features. RESULTS: Of the 338 patients with cerebellar ataxia, we identified 
      putative clinically relevant CNV deletions in 3 patients: an identical deletion 
      encompassing ITPR1 in 2 patients, who turned out to be related, and a deletion 
      involving PPP2R2B in another patient. Although the CNV deletion in ITPR1 was 
      clearly the underlying cause of SCA15 in the 2 related patients, the clinical 
      significance of the deletion in PPP2R2B remained unknown. DISCUSSION: We showed 
      that CNVs detectable with the limited resolution of SNP array are a very rare 
      cause of SCA. Nevertheless, we suggest adding CNV analysis alongside SNV analysis 
      to SCA gene diagnostics using next-generation sequencing approaches, at least for 
      ITPR1, to improve the genetic diagnostics for patients.

LID - 10.1002/acn3.51936 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The GAA repeat expansion within the fibroblast growth 
      factor 14 (FGF14) gene has been found to be associated with late-onset cerebellar 
      ataxia. This study aimed to investigate the genetic causes of cerebellar ataxia 
      in patients in Japan. METHODS: We collected a case series of 940 index patients 
      who presented with chronic cerebellar ataxia and remained genetically undiagnosed 
      after our preliminary genetic screening. To investigate the FGF14 repeat locus, 
      we employed an integrated diagnostic strategy that involved fluorescence amplicon 
      length analysis polymerase chain reaction (PCR), repeat-primed PCR, and long-read 
      sequencing. RESULTS: Pathogenic FGF14 GAA repeat expansions were detected in 12 
      patients from 11 unrelated families. The median size of the pathogenic GAA repeat 
      was 309 repeats (range: 270-316 repeats). In these patients, the mean age of 
      onset was 66.9 +/- 9.6 years, with episodic symptoms observed in 56% of patients 
      and parkinsonism in 30% of patients. We also detected FGF14 repeat expansions in 
      a patient with a phenotype of multiple system atrophy, including cerebellar 
      ataxia, parkinsonism, autonomic ataxia, and bilateral vocal cord paralysis. Brain 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed normal to mild cerebellar atrophy, and a 
      follow-up study conducted after a mean period of 6 years did not reveal any 
      significant progression. DISCUSSION: This study highlights the importance of 
      FGF14 GAA repeat analysis in patients with late-onset cerebellar ataxia, 
      particularly when they exhibit episodic symptoms, or their brain MRI shows no 
      apparent cerebellar atrophy. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of 
      the clinical variability of GAA-FGF14-related diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Intronic FGF14 GAA repeat expansions have recently been found to be a 
      common cause of hereditary ataxia (GAA-FGF14 ataxia; SCA27B). The global 
      epidemiology and regional prevalence of this newly reported disorder remain to be 
      established. In this study, we investigated the frequency of GAA-FGF14 ataxia in 
      a large cohort of Brazilian patients with unsolved adult-onset ataxia. METHODS: 
      We recruited 93 index patients with genetically unsolved adult-onset ataxia 
      despite extensive genetic investigation and genotyped the FGF14 repeat locus. 
      Patients were recruited across 4 different regions of Brazil. RESULTS: Of the 93 
      index patients, 8 (9%) carried an FGF14 (GAA)(>/=250) expansion. The expansion was 
      also identified in 1 affected relative. Seven patients were of European descent, 
      1 was of African descent, and 1was of admixed American ancestry. One patient 
      carrying a (GAA)(376) expansion developed ataxia at age 28 years, confirming that 
      GAA-FGF14 ataxia can occur before the age of 30 years. One patient displayed 
      episodic symptoms, while none had downbeat nystagmus. Cerebellar atrophy was 
      observed on brain MRI in 7 of 8 patients (87%). DISCUSSION: Our results suggest 
      that GAA-FGF14 ataxia is a common cause of adult-onset ataxia in the Brazilian 
      population, although larger studies are needed to fully define its epidemiology.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dominantly inherited GAA repeat expansions in the 
      fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) gene have recently been shown to cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 27B (SCA27B). We aimed to study the frequency and 
      phenotype of SCA27B in a cohort of patients with unsolved late-onset cerebellar 
      ataxia (LOCA). We also assessed the frequency of SCA27B relative to other 
      genetically defined LOCAs. METHODS: We recruited a consecutive series of 107 
      patients with LOCA, of whom 64 remained genetically undiagnosed. We screened 
      these 64 patients for the FGF14 GAA repeat expansion. We next analysed the 
      frequency of SCA27B relative to other genetically defined forms of LOCA in the 
      cohort of 107 patients. RESULTS: Eighteen of 64 patients (28%) carried an FGF14 
      (GAA)(>/=250) expansion. The median (range) age at onset was 62.5 (39-72) years. 
      The most common clinical features included gait ataxia (100%) and mild cerebellar 
      dysarthria (67%). In addition, episodic symptoms and downbeat nystagmus were 
      present in 39% (7/18) and 37% (6/16) of patients, respectively. SCA27B was the 
      most common cause of LOCA in our cohort (17%, 18/107). Among patients with 
      genetically defined LOCA, SCA27B was the main cause of pure ataxia, RFC1-related 
      disease of ataxia with neuropathy, and SPG7 of ataxia with spasticity. 
      CONCLUSION: We showed that SCA27B is the most common cause of LOCA in our cohort. 
      Our results support the use of FGF14 GAA repeat expansion screening as a 
      first-tier genetic test in patients with LOCA.

TI  - Intronic FGF14 GAA repeat expansions are a common cause of ataxia syndromes with 
      neuropathy and bilateral vestibulopathy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intronic GAA repeat expansions in the fibroblast growth factor 14 
      gene (FGF14) have recently been identified as a common cause of ataxia with 
      potential phenotypic overlap with RFC1-related cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). Our objective was to report on the 
      frequency of intronic FGF14 GAA repeat expansions in patients with an unexplained 
      CANVAS-like phenotype. METHODS: We recruited 45 patients negative for biallelic 
      RFC1 repeat expansions with a combination of cerebellar ataxia plus peripheral 
      neuropathy and/or bilateral vestibulopathy (BVP), and genotyped the FGF14 repeat 
      locus. Phenotypic features of GAA-FGF14-positive versus GAA-FGF14-negative 
      patients were compared. RESULTS: Frequency of FGF14 GAA repeat expansions was 38% 
      (17/45) in the entire cohort, 38% (5/13) in the subgroup with cerebellar ataxia 
      plus polyneuropathy, 43% (9/21) in the subgroup with cerebellar ataxia plus BVP 
      and 27% (3/11) in patients with all three features. BVP was observed in 75% 
      (12/16) of GAA-FGF14-positive patients. Polyneuropathy was at most mild and of 
      mixed sensorimotor type in six of eight GAA-FGF14-positive patients. Family 
      history of ataxia (59% vs 15%; p=0.007) was significantly more frequent and 
      permanent cerebellar dysarthria (12% vs 54%; p=0.009) significantly less frequent 
      in GAA-FGF14-positive than in GAA-FGF14-negative patients. Age at onset was 
      inversely correlated to the size of the repeat expansion (Pearson's r, -0.67; 
      R(2)=0.45; p=0.0031). CONCLUSIONS: GAA-FGF14-related disease is a common cause of 
      cerebellar ataxia with polyneuropathy and/or BVP, and should be included in the 
      differential diagnosis of RFC1 CANVAS and disease spectrum.

AB  - Dominantly inherited GAA repeat expansions in FGF14 are a common cause of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (GAA-FGF14 ataxia; spinocerebellar ataxia 27B). Molecular 
      confirmation of FGF14 GAA repeat expansions has thus far mostly relied on 
      long-read sequencing, a technology that is not yet widely available in clinical 
      laboratories. We developed and validated a strategy to detect FGF14 GAA repeat 
      expansions using long-range PCR, bidirectional repeat-primed PCRs, and Sanger 
      sequencing. We compared this strategy to targeted nanopore sequencing in a cohort 
      of 22 French Canadian patients and next validated it in a cohort of 53 French 
      index patients with unsolved ataxia. Method comparison showed that capillary 
      electrophoresis of long-range PCR amplification products significantly 
      underestimated expansion sizes compared to nanopore sequencing (slope, 0.87 [95% 
      CI, 0.81 to 0.93]; intercept, 14.58 [95% CI, - 2.48 to 31.12]) and gel 
      electrophoresis (slope, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.78 to 0.97]; intercept, 21.34 [95% CI, 
      - 27.66 to 40.22]). The latter techniques yielded similar size estimates. 
      Following calibration with internal controls, expansion size estimates were 
      similar between capillary electrophoresis and nanopore sequencing (slope: 0.98 
      [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.04]; intercept: 10.62 [95% CI, - 7.49 to 27.71]), and gel 
      electrophoresis (slope: 0.94 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.09]; intercept: 18.81 [95% CI, 
      - 41.93 to 39.15]). Diagnosis was accurately confirmed for all 22 French Canadian 
      patients using this strategy. We also identified 9 French patients (9/53; 17%) 
      and 2 of their relatives who carried an FGF14 (GAA)(>/=250) expansion. This novel 
      strategy reliably detected and sized FGF14 GAA expansions, and compared favorably 
      to long-read sequencing.

TI  - GAA-FGF14 ataxia (SCA27B): phenotypic profile, natural history progression and 
      4-aminopyridine treatment response.
PG  - 4144-4157
LID - 10.1093/brain/awad157 [doi]
AB  - Ataxia due to an autosomal dominant intronic GAA repeat expansion in FGF14 
      [GAA-FGF14 ataxia, spinocerebellar ataxia 27B (SCA27B)] has recently been 
      identified as one of the most common genetic late-onset ataxias. We here aimed to 
      characterize its phenotypic profile, natural history progression, and 
      4-aminopyridine (4-AP) treatment response. We conducted a multi-modal cohort 
      study of 50 GAA-FGF14 patients, comprising in-depth phenotyping, cross-sectional 
      and longitudinal progression data (up to 7 years), MRI findings, serum 
      neurofilament light (sNfL) levels, neuropathology, and 4-AP treatment response 
      data, including a series of n-of-1 treatment studies. GAA-FGF14 ataxia 
      consistently presented as late-onset [60.0 years (53.5-68.5), median 
      (interquartile range)] pancerebellar syndrome, partly combined with afferent 
      sensory deficits (55%) and dysautonomia (28%). Dysautonomia increased with 
      duration while cognitive impairment remained infrequent, even in advanced stages. 
      Cross-sectional and longitudinal assessments consistently indicated mild 
      progression of ataxia [0.29 Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) 
      points/year], not exceeding a moderate disease severity even in advanced stages 
      (maximum SARA score: 18 points). Functional impairment increased relatively 
      slowly (unilateral mobility aids after 8 years in 50% of patients). Corresponding 
      to slow progression and low extra-cerebellar involvement, sNfL was not increased 
      relative to controls. Concurrent second diseases (including progressive 
      supranuclear palsy neuropathology) represented major individual aggravators of 
      disease severity, constituting important caveats for planning future GAA-FGF14 
      trials. A treatment response to 4-AP with relevance for everyday living was 
      reported by 86% of treated patients. A series of three prospective n-of-1 
      treatment experiences with on/off design showed marked reduction in daily 
      symptomatic time and symptom severity on 4-AP. Our study characterizes the 
      phenotypic profile, natural history progression, and 4-AP treatment response of 
      GAA-FGF14 ataxia. It paves the way towards large-scale natural history studies 
      and 4-AP treatment trials in this newly discovered, possibly most frequent, and 
      treatable late-onset ataxia.

TI  - Deep Intronic FGF14 GAA Repeat Expansion in Late-Onset Cerebellar Ataxia.
PG  - 128-141
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2207406 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The late-onset cerebellar ataxias (LOCAs) have largely resisted 
      molecular diagnosis. METHODS: We sequenced the genomes of six persons with 
      autosomal dominant LOCA who were members of three French Canadian families and 
      identified a candidate pathogenic repeat expansion. We then tested for 
      association between the repeat expansion and disease in two independent 
      case-control series - one French Canadian (66 patients and 209 controls) and the 
      other German (228 patients and 199 controls). We also genotyped the repeat in 20 
      Australian and 31 Indian index patients. We assayed gene and protein expression 
      in two postmortem cerebellum specimens and two induced pluripotent stem-cell 
      (iPSC)-derived motor-neuron cell lines. RESULTS: In the six French Canadian 
      patients, we identified a GAA repeat expansion deep in the first intron of FGF14, 
      which encodes fibroblast growth factor 14. Cosegregation of the repeat expansion 
      with disease in the families supported a pathogenic threshold of at least 250 GAA 
      repeats ([GAA](>/=250)). There was significant association between FGF14 
      (GAA)(>/=250) expansions and LOCA in the French Canadian series (odds ratio, 
      105.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 31.09 to 334.20; P<0.001) and in the German 
      series (odds ratio, 8.76; 95% CI, 3.45 to 20.84; P<0.001). The repeat expansion 
      was present in 61%, 18%, 15%, and 10% of French Canadian, German, Australian, and 
      Indian index patients, respectively. In total, we identified 128 patients with 
      LOCA who carried an FGF14 (GAA)(>/=250) expansion. Postmortem cerebellum specimens 
      and iPSC-derived motor neurons from patients showed reduced expression of FGF14 
      RNA and protein. CONCLUSIONS: A dominantly inherited deep intronic GAA repeat 
      expansion in FGF14 was found to be associated with LOCA. (Funded by Fondation

AB  - Adult-onset cerebellar ataxias are a group of neurodegenerative conditions that 
      challenge both genetic discovery and molecular diagnosis. In this study, we 
      identified an intronic (GAA) repeat expansion in fibroblast growth factor 14 
      (FGF14). Genetic analysis of 95 Australian individuals with adult-onset ataxia 
      identified four (4.2%) with (GAA)(>300) and a further nine individuals with 
      (GAA)(>250). PCR and long-read sequence analysis revealed these were pure (GAA) 
      repeats. In comparison, no control subjects had (GAA)(>300) and only 2/311 
      control individuals (0.6%) had a pure (GAA)(>250). In a German validation cohort, 
      9/104 (8.7%) of affected individuals had (GAA)(>335) and a further six had 
      (GAA)(>250), whereas 10/190 (5.3%) control subjects had (GAA)(>250) but none were 
      (GAA)(>335). The combined data suggest (GAA)(>335) are disease causing and fully 
      penetrant (p = 6.0 x 10(-8), OR = 72 [95% CI = 4.3-1,227]), while (GAA)(>250) is 
      likely pathogenic with reduced penetrance. Affected individuals had an 
      adult-onset, slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia with variable features 
      including vestibular impairment, hyper-reflexia, and autonomic dysfunction. A 
      negative correlation between age at onset and repeat length was observed (R(2) = 
      0.44, p = 0.00045, slope = -0.12) and identification of a shared haplotype in a 
      minority of individuals suggests that the expansion can be inherited or generated 
      de novo during meiotic division. This study demonstrates the power of genome 
      sequencing and advanced bioinformatic tools to identify novel repeat expansions 
      via model-free, genome-wide analysis and identifies SCA50/ATX-FGF14 as a frequent 
      cause of adult-onset ataxia.

TI  - Genome-wide detection of tandem DNA repeats that are expanded in autism.
PG  - 80-86
LID - 10.1038/s41586-020-2579-z [doi]
AB  - Tandem DNA repeats vary in the size and sequence of each unit (motif). When 
      expanded, these tandem DNA repeats have been associated with more than 40 
      monogenic disorders(1). Their involvement in disorders with complex genetics is 
      largely unknown, as is the extent of their heterogeneity. Here we investigated 
      the genome-wide characteristics of tandem repeats that had motifs with a length 
      of 2-20 base pairs in 17,231 genomes of families containing individuals with 
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD)(2,3) and population control individuals(4). We 
      found extensive polymorphism in the size and sequence of motifs. Many of the 
      tandem repeat loci that we detected correlated with cytogenetic fragile sites. At 
      2,588 loci, gene-associated expansions of tandem repeats that were rare among 
      population control individuals were significantly more prevalent among 
      individuals with ASD than their siblings without ASD, particularly in exons and 
      near splice junctions, and in genes related to the development of the nervous 
      system and cardiovascular system or muscle. Rare tandem repeat expansions had a 
      prevalence of 23.3% in children with ASD compared with 20.7% in children without 
      ASD, which suggests that tandem repeat expansions make a collective contribution 
      to the risk of ASD of 2.6%. These rare tandem repeat expansions included 
      previously undescribed ASD-linked expansions in DMPK and FXN, which are 
      associated with neuromuscular conditions, and in previously unknown loci such as 
      FGF14 and CACNB1. Rare tandem repeat expansions were associated with lower IQ and 
      adaptive ability. Our results show that tandem DNA repeat expansions contribute 
      strongly to the genetic aetiology and phenotypic complexity of ASD.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 27 (SCA27) is an autosomal dominant SCA caused by variants 
      in the fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) gene. We examined a Japanese SCA 
      patient whose deceased father also suffered from SCA. The patient was a 
      63-year-old male. He graduated from junior high school but received no further 
      education. The predominant complaint was slowly progressive dysarthria and gait 
      disturbance, which appeared at age 47. He showed pathological saccadic dysmetria, 
      saccadic intrusions into smooth pursuit eye movements, dysarthria, and limb and 
      truncal ataxia. His gait was wide-based but he did not require a walking stick. 
      Limb muscle strength was intact. Deep tendon reflexes were normal or slightly 
      reduced. Pathological reflexes were absent. He demonstrated mildly impaired 
      vibration sense in the lower limbs. There was no urinary dysfunction. Brain MRI 
      showed cerebellar atrophy without brainstem involvement. We first confirmed the 
      absence of repeat expansion in genes known to be responsible for SCAs 1-3, 6-8, 
      10, 12, 17, 36 and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. By exome analysis, we 
      identified a novel heterozygous variant (NM_004115, c.529A>T; Lys177X) in exon 4 
      of the FGF14 gene. This variant is expected to generate a truncated FGF14 protein 
      lacking the heparin binding sites, those are likely to modify the activity of 
      FGF14. We confirmed the absence of the variant in 502 healthy Japanese 
      individuals by Sanger sequencing. There is no record of the variant in public 
      databases. We conclude that the novel variation in FGF14 is causative for SCA27 
      in this patient.

TI  - A panel study on patients with dominant cerebellar ataxia highlights the 
      frequency of channelopathies.
PG  - 1579-1594

AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias have a marked heterogeneous genetic 
      background, with mutations in 34 genes identified so far. This large amount of 
      implicated genes accounts for heterogeneous clinical presentations, making 
      genotype-phenotype correlations a major challenge in the field. While 
      polyglutamine ataxias, linked to CAG repeat expansions in genes such as ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, CACNA1A and TBP, have been extensively characterized in 
      large cohorts, there is a need for comprehensive assessment of frequency and 
      phenotype of more 'conventional' ataxias. After exclusion of CAG/polyglutamine 
      expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia genes in 412 index cases with dominantly 
      inherited cerebellar ataxias, we aimed to establish the relative frequencies of 
      mutations in other genes, with an approach combining panel sequencing and TaqMan(R) 
      polymerase chain reaction assay. We found relevant genetic variants in 59 
      patients (14.3%). The most frequently mutated were channel genes [CACNA1A (n = 
      16), KCND3 (n = 4), KCNC3 (n = 2) and KCNA1 (n = 2)]. Deletions in ITPR1 (n = 11) 
      were followed by biallelic variants in SPG7 (n = 9). Variants in AFG3L2 (n = 7) 
      came next in frequency, and variants were rarely found in STBN2 (n = 2), ELOVL5, 
      FGF14, STUB1 and TTBK2 (n = 1 each). Interestingly, possible risk factor variants 
      were detected in SPG7 and POLG. Clinical comparisons showed that ataxias due to 
      channelopathies had a significantly earlier age at onset with an average of 24.6 
      years, versus 40.9 years for polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias and 
      37.8 years for SPG7-related forms (P = 0.001). In contrast, disease duration was 
      significantly longer in the former (20.5 years versus 9.3 and 13.7, P=0.001), 
      though for similar functional stages, indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. Of interest, intellectual deficiency was more frequent in channel 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, while cognitive impairment in adulthood was similar 
      among the three groups. Similar differences were found among a single gene group, 
      comparing 23 patients with CACNA1A expansions (spinocerebellar ataxia 6) to 22 
      patients with CACNA1A point mutations, which had lower average age at onset (25.2 
      versus 47.3 years) with longer disease duration (18.7 versus 10.9), but lower 
      severity indexes (0.39 versus 0.44), indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. In conclusion, we identified relevant genetic variations in up to 15% of 
      cases after exclusion of polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias, and 
      confirmed CACNA1A and SPG7 as major ataxia genes. We could delineate firm 
      genotype-phenotype correlations that are important for genetic counselling and of 
      possible prognostic value.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 28: a novel AFG3L2 mutation in a German family with young 
      onset, slow progression and saccadic slowing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 28 (SCA28) is related to mutations of the 
      ATPase family gene 3-like 2 gene (AFG3L2). To date, 13 private missense mutations 
      have been identified in families of French, Italian, and German ancestry, but 
      overall, the disorder seems to be rare in Europe. Here, we report a kindred of 
      German ancestry with four affected family members presenting with slowly 
      progressive ataxia, mild pyramidal tract signs and slow saccades. METHODS: After 
      excluding repeat expansions in the genes for SCA1-3, 6-8, 10, 12, and 17, Sanger 
      sequencing of the coding regions of TTBK2 (SCA11), KCNC3 (SCA13), PRKCG (SCA14), 
      FGF14 (SCA27) and AFG3L2 (SCA28) was performed. The 17 coding exons of AFG3L2 
      with flanking intronic sequences were amplified by PCR and sequenced on both 
      strands. RESULTS: Sequencing detected a novel potential missense mutation 
      (p.Y689N) in the C-terminal proteolytic domain, the mutational hotspot of AFG3L2. 
      The online programme "PolyPhen-2" classifies this amino acid exchange as probably 
      damaging (score 0.990). Similarly to most of the published SCA28 mutations, the 
      novel mutation is located within exon 16. Mutations in exon 16 alter the 
      proteolytic activity of the protease AFG3L2 that is highly expressed in Purkinje 
      cells. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic testing should be considered in dominant ataxia with 
      pyramidal tract signs and saccadic slowing.

AB  - Purine repeat sequences present in the human genome are known to act as hotspots 
      for mutations leading to chromosomal imbalances. It is established that large 
      purine repeats (PRs) form stable DNA triplex structure which can inhibit gene 
      expression. Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), the autosomal neurodegenerative disorder 
      is the only human disease known so far, where a large purine (GAA) repeat in the 
      FXN gene is known to inhibit the expression of frataxin protein. We explored the 
      hidden purine repeats (PRn with n >/= 200) if any, in the human genome to find out 
      how they are associated with neurological disorders. The results showed 28 PRs, 
      which are mostly restricted to the intronic regions. Interestingly, the 
      transcriptome expression analysis of PR-carrying genes (PR-genes) revealed that 
      most of them are down-regulated in neurological disorders (autism, Alzheimer's 
      disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, mental retardation, Parkinson's disease, brain 
      tumor) as compared to that in healthy controls. The altered gene expression in 
      brain disorders can be interpreted in terms of a possible expansion of purine 
      repeats leading to formation of very stable DNA-triplex and/or alleviation of the 
      repair enzymes and/or other unknown cellular factors. Interactome analysis 
      identified four PR-genes in signaling pathways whose dysregulation is correlated 
      directly with pathogenesis: GRK5 and KLK6 in Alzheimer's disease; FGF14 in 
      craniosynostosis, mental retardation and FLT1 in neuroferritinopathy. By virtue 
      of being mutational hotspots and their ability to form DNA-triplex, purine 
      repeats in genome disturb the genome integrity and interfere with the 
      transcriptional regulation. However, validation of the disease linkage of 
      PR-genes can be validated using knock-out techniques.

      localization is known solely. Recently, a missense mutation in the fibroblast 
      growth factor 14 gene (FGF14) has been reported in a Dutch family with a new 
      dominantly inherited form of SCA. To evaluate the frequency of mutations in the 
      FGF14 gene, we performed molecular genetic analyses for the five exons in 208 
      nonrelated familial ataxia cases and 208 control samples. In one patient, we 
      detected a novel single base pair deletion in exon 4 (c.487delA) creating a 
      frameshift mutation. In addition, we found DNA polymorphisms in exon 1a, 4, and 
      5, an amino-acid exchange at position 124, as well as a single-nucleotide 
      polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region of exon 5.

TI  - Molecular genetics of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia: mutation analysis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia genes and CAG/CTG repeat expansion detection in 225 
      Italian families.
PG  - 727-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, at present 
      associated with 22 loci (spinocerebellar ataxia [SCA] 1-SCA8, SCA10-SCA19, SCA21, 
      SCA22, fibroblast growth factor 14 [FGF14]-SCA, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy [DRPLA]). The relevant gene has been identified in 12 cases (SCA1-3, 
      SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, FGF14, and DRPLA), and in all but the recently identified 
      SCA14, SCA17, PRKCG and FGF14 genes, the defect consists of the expansion of a 
      short nucleotide repeat. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relative prevalence of 
      SCA1-3, SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, and SCA17 gene expansions in Italian families with 
      hereditary ataxia, specifically to verify the occurrence of SCA10, SCA12, and 
      SCA17 in Italy; and to analyze samples from probands with negative test results 
      at the initial screening by means of the repeat expansion detection technique to 
      identify CAG/CTG expansions in novel loci.Patients Two hundred twenty-five 
      unrelated Italian index cases with hereditary ataxia, most (n = 183) of whom 
      presented with a clear dominantly transmitted trait. RESULTS: We found that SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene mutations accounted for most cases (21% and 24%, respectively). We 
      found SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, and SCA17 to be very rare (approximately 1% each), 
      and no case of SCA10 or SCA12 was identified. Half of the index cases (113/225) 
      were negative for expansions in the known SCA genes. Repeat expansion detection 
      analysis performed on 111 of these cases showed a CAG/CTG repeat expansion of at 
      least 50 triplets in 22 (20%). Twenty-one of 22 expansions could be attributed to 
      length variation at 2 polymorphic loci (expanded repeat domain CAG/CTG 1 [ERDA1] 
      or CTG repeat on chromosome 18q21.1 [CTG18.1]). In 1 patient, the expansion was 
      assigned to the DRPLA gene. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of SCA1-3 and SCA6-7 
      gene mutations is peculiar in Italy. We found a relatively high frequency of SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene expansions; SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 mutations were rare, compared with 
      other European countries. No SCA10 or SCA12 and only a few SCA8 (2/225) and SCA17 
      (2/225) families were detected. In patients negative for defects in known SCA 
      genes, repeat expansion detection data strongly suggest that, at least in our 
      population, CAG/CTG expansions in novel genes should be considered an unlikely 
      cause of the SCA phenotype.
