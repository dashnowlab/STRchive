AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansions fold into long, stable hairpins and cause a 
      variety of incurable RNA gain-of-function diseases such as Huntington's disease, 
      the myotonic dystrophies, and spinocerebellar ataxias. One approach for treating 
      these diseases is to bind small molecules to the structured RNAs. Both 
      Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) are caused 
      by a r(CUG) repeat expansion, or r(CUG)(exp). The RNA folds into a hairpin 
      structure with a periodic array of 1x1 nucleotide UU loops (5'CUG/3'GUC; where 
      the underlined nucleotides indicate the Us in the internal loop) that sequester 
      various RNA-binding proteins (RBP) and hence the source of its gain-of-function. 
      Here, we report NMR-refined structures of single 5'CUG/3'GUC motifs in complex 
      with three different small molecules, a di-guandinobenzoate (1), a derivative of 
      1 where the guanidino groups have been exchanged for imidazole (2), and a 
      quinoline with improved drug-like properties (3). These structures were 
      determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and simulated 
      annealing with restrained molecular dynamics (MD). Compounds 1, 2, and 3 formed 
      stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions with the 5'CUG/3'GUC motif. Compound 3 
      also formed van der Waals interactions with the internal loop. The global 
      structure of each RNA-small molecule complexes retains an A-form conformation, 
      while the internal loops are still dynamic but to a lesser extent compared to the 
      unbound form. These results aid our understanding of ligand-RNA interactions and 
      enable structure-based design of small molecules with improved binding affinity 
      for and biological activity against r(CUG)(exp). As the first ever reported 
      structures of RNA r(CUG) repeats bound to ligands, these structures can enable 
      virtual screening campaigns combined with machine learning assisted de novo 
      design.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2) is a neurodegenerative disorder, 
      affecting only individuals of African ancestry. Full penetrance occurs in 
      individuals with 40 repeats or more. OBJECTIVE: To describe the phenotypic 
      variability of HDL2 in a group of mixed ancestry individuals from South Africa. 
      METHODS: Eight patients were assessed with analysis of repeat size and magnetic 
      resonance brain imaging. We applied the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale 
      (UHDRS), but in deceased patients (4), this was estimated from video material. 
      RESULTS: Cognitive domains were more severely affected than motor; UHDRS motor 
      scores were notable for bradykinesia, and to a slightly lesser extent, for 
      rigidity and dystonia; a single patient had marked chorea. Repeat lengths ranged 
      from 45 to 63 (median, 52). CONCLUSION: This South African group of mixed 
      ancestry HDL2 individuals presented with severe cognitive and behavioral 
      impairments, with lesser degrees or absence of chorea. This presentation is 
      possibly related to large repeat sizes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease like 2 (HDL2) has been reported exclusively in 
      patients with African ancestry, mostly originating from South Africa. CASE 
      REPORT: We report three patients in Mali including a proband and his two children 
      who have been examined by neurologists and psychiatrists after giving consent. 
      They were aged between 28 and 56 years old. Psychiatric symptoms were predominant 
      in the two younger patients while the father presented mainly with motor 
      symptoms. Genetic testing identified a heterozygous 40 CTG repeat expansion in 
      the Junctophilin-3 (JPH3) gene in all three patients. DISCUSSION: This study 
      supports the hypothesis that HDL2 may be widely spread across Africa. HIGHLIGHTS: 
      We report here the first case of HDL2 in West Africa, suggesting that HDL2 is 
      widely spread across African continent, and increasing access to genetic testing 
      could uncover other cases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To perform a screening for Huntington disease (HD) phenocopies in a 
      Swedish cohort. METHODS: Seventy-three DNA samples negative for HD were assessed 
      at a tertiary center in Stockholm. The screening included analyses for 
      C9orf72-frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9orf72-FTD/ALS), 
      octapeptide repeat insertions (OPRIs) in PRNP associated with inherited prion 
      diseases (IPD), Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2), spinocerebellar ataxia-2 
      (SCA2), spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) and spinocerebellar ataxia-17 (SCA17). 
      Targeted genetic analysis was carried out in two cases based on the salient 
      phenotypic features. RESULTS: The screening identified two patients with SCA17, 
      one patient with IPD associated with 5-OPRI but none with nucleotide expansions 
      in C9orf72 or for HDL2, SCA2 or SCA3. Furthermore, SGCE-myoclonic-dystonia 11 
      (SGCE-M-D) and benign hereditary chorea (BHC) was diagnosed in two sporadic 
      cases. WES identified VUS in STUB1 in two patients with predominant cerebellar 
      ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in keeping with previous screenings and 
      suggest that other genes yet to be discovered are involved in the etiology of HD 
      phenocopies.

TI  - Clinical and Molecular Findings of Intermediate Allele Carriers in the HTT Gene 
      from the Mexican Mestizo Population.
PG  - 34-42
LID - 10.1159/000526260 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There are reports of different clinical statuses in carriers of 
      intermediate alleles (IAs) of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the HTT gene, from 
      individuals affected by a clinical picture indistinguishable from Huntington's 
      disease (HD) to those without manifestations. Therefore, the possible clinical 
      significance of these alleles has been widely debated. OBJECTIVES: The aim of 
      this study was to describe general and clinical features and discard HD 
      phenocopies by molecular assessment in a case series of IA carriers on the HTT 
      gene of a laboratory sample from a neurological center in Mexico. METHODS: We 
      selected individuals who had previously been tested for the HTT gene expansion, 
      which resulted in IAs. Clinical information was obtained from medical records, 
      and molecular analysis of the JPH3, PRNP, and TBP genes was performed only in IA 
      carriers with clinical manifestations. In addition, two patients with IA and 
      acanthocytes were evaluated by whole-exome sequencing. The scientific and ethical 
      committees of the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery Manuel Velasco 
      Suarez (NINNMVS) approved this study. RESULTS: From 1994 to 2019, the Genetics 
      Department of the NINNMVS confirmed 34 individuals with IAs, 15 of whom belonged 
      to 11 families with HD (IA-HD) and 19 of whom had no family history of HD 
      (IA-non-HD). We found a high proportion of manifestations of the HD phenotypic 
      spectrum in the IA-non-HD subgroup. In addition, among the 20 samples of IA 
      carriers with manifestations molecularly evaluated, we identified two unrelated 
      subjects with CAG/CTG repeat expansions on the JPH3 gene, confirming HD-like 2 
      (HDL2), and one patient with the homozygous pathogenic c.3232G>T variant 
      (p.Glu1078Ter) in the VPS13A gene, demonstrating choreoacanthocytosis. 
      DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Our results show the most extensive series of subjects 
      with IAs and clinical manifestations. In addition, we identify three HD 
      phenocopies, two HDL2 cases, and one choreoacanthocytosis case. Therefore, we 
      emphasize evaluating other HD phenocopies in IA carriers with clinical 
      manifestations whose family background is not associated with HD.

AB  - Junctophilin-3 belongs to a triprotein junctional complex implicated in the 
      regulation of neuronal excitability and involved in the formation of junctional 
      membrane structures between voltage-gated ion channels and endoplasmic 
      (ryanodine) reticular receptors. A monoallelic trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      located within the junctophilin-3 gene (JPH3) has been implicated in a rare 
      autosomal dominant (AD) late-onset (and progressive) disorder clinically 
      resembling Huntington disease (HD), and known as HD-like 2 (HDL2; MIM# 606438). 
      Although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying HDL2 has not yet been fully 
      elucidated, toxic gain-of-function of the aberrant transcript (containing the 
      trinucleotide repeat) and loss of expression of (full-length) junctophilin-3 have 
      both been implicated in HDL2 pathophysiology. In this study, we identified by 
      whole exome sequencing (WES) a JPH3 homozygous truncating variant [NM_020655.4: 
      c.17405dup; p.(Val581Argfs*137)]. in a female individual affected with 
      genetically undetermined neurodevelopmental anomalies (including delayed motor 
      milestones, abnormal social communication, language difficulties and borderline 
      cognitive impairment) and paroxysmal attacks of dystonia since her early infancy. 
      Our study expands the JPH3-associated mutational spectrum and clinical 
      phenotypes, implicating the loss of Junctophilin-3 in heterogeneous 
      neurodevelopmental phenotypes and early-onset paroxysmal movement disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington Disease-Like 2 (HDL2) is a rare autosomal dominant 
      disorder caused by an abnormal CAG/CTG triplet repeat expansion on chromosome 
      16q24. The symptoms of progressive decline in motor, cognitive and psychiatric 
      functioning are similar to those of Huntington's disease (HD). The psychiatric 
      features of the HDL2 have been poorly characterized. OBJECTIVE: To describe the 
      neuropsychiatric features of HDL2 and compare them with those of HD. METHODS: A 
      blinded cross-sectional design was used to compare the behavioural component of 
      the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) in participants with HDL2 
      (n = 15) and HD (n = 13) with African ancestry. RESULTS: HDL2 patients presented 
      with psychiatric symptoms involving mood disturbances and behavioural changes 
      that were not significantly different from those in the HD group. Duration of 
      disease and motor performance correlated (p < 0.001) with the Functional Capacity 
      score and the Independence score of the UHDRS. HD patients reported movement 
      dysfunction as the first symptom more frequently than HDL2 Patients (p < 0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: The psychiatric phenotype of HDL2 is similar to that of HD and linked 
      to motor decline and disease duration. Psychiatric symptoms seem more severe for 
      HDL2 patients in the early stages of the disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnostic workup for choreiform movement disorders including 
      Huntington's disease (HD) and those mimicking HD like phenotype is complex. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to genetically define HD and HD-like 
      presentations in an Indian cohort. We also describe HTT-CAG expansion manifesting 
      as neuroferritinopathy-like disorder in four families from Punjab in India. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: 159 patients clinically diagnosed as HD and HD-like 
      presentations from various tertiary neurology clinics were referred to our centre 
      (CSIR-IGIB) for genetic investigations. As a first tier test, CAG-TNR for HTT was 
      performed and subsequently HD-negative samples were screened for JPH3 (HDL2), TBP 
      (SCA17), ATN1 (DRPLA), PPP2R2B (SCA12) and GGGGCC expansion in C9orf72 gene. Four 
      families presenting as neuroferritinopathy-like disorder were also investigated 
      for HTT-CAG expansion. RESULTS: 94 of 159 (59%) patients were found to have 
      expanded HTT-CAG repeats. Pathogenic repeat expansion in JPH3, TBP, ATN1 and 
      C9orf72 were not found in HD negative cases. Two patients were positive for 
      SCA12-CAG expansion in pathogenic length, whereas 5 cases harboured TBP-CAG 
      repeats falling in reduced penetrance range of 41- 48 repeats for SCA17. Four 
      unrelated families, presented with atypical chorea and brain MRI findings 
      suggestive of basal ganglia abnormalities mimicking neuroferritinopathy were 
      found to harbour HTT-CAG expansion. CONCLUSION: We present SCA12 as a new 
      reported phenocopy of HD which should be considered for diagnostic workout along 
      with SCA17 for HD-like syndromes. This study also illustrates the necessity, to 
      consider evolving HD like phenotype, as a clinical diagnosis for cases with 
      initial manifestations depicting neuroferritinopathy.

AB  - Huntington's Disease-Like 2 (HDL2), caused by a CTG/CAG expansion in JPH3 on 
      chromosome 16q24, is the most common Huntington's Disease (HD) phenocopy in 
      populations with African ancestry. Qualitatively, brain MRIs of HDL2 patients 
      have been indistinguishable from HD. To determine brain regions most affected in 
      HDL2 a cross-sectional study using MRI brain volumetry was undertaken to compare 
      the brains of nine HDL2, 11 HD and nine age matched control participants. 
      Participants were ascertained from the region in South Africa with the world's 
      highest HDL2 incidence. The HDL2 and HD patient groups showed no significant 
      differences with respect to mean age at MRI, disease duration, abnormal triplet 
      repeat length, or age at disease onset. Overall, intracerebral volumes were 
      smaller in both affected groups compared to the control group. Comparing the HDL2 
      and HD groups across multiple covariates, cortical and subcortical volumes were 
      similar with the exception that the HDL2 thalamic volumes were smaller. 
      Consistent with other similarities between the two diseases, these results 
      indicate a pattern of neurodegeneration in HDL2 that is remarkably similar to HD. 
      However smaller thalamic volumes in HDL2 raises intriguing questions into the 
      pathogenesis of both disorders, and how these volumetric differences relate to 
      their respective phenotypes.

TI  - Large normal alleles of ATXN2 decrease age at onset in transthyretin familial 
      amyloid polyneuropathy Val30Met patients.
PG  - 251-258

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Transthyretin (TTR)-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is 
      an autosomal dominant neurological disease, caused most frequently by a Val30Met 
      (now classified as Val50Met) substitution in TTR. Age at onset (AO) ranges from 
      19 to 82 years, and variability exists mostly between generations. Unstable 
      oligonucleotide repeats in various genes are the mechanism behind several 
      neurological diseases, found also to act as modifiers for other disorders. Our 
      aim was to investigate whether large normal repeat alleles of 10 genes had a 
      possible modifier effect in AO in Portuguese TTR-FAP Val30Met families. METHODS: 
      We analyzed 329 Portuguese patients from 123 families. Repeat length (at ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, TBP, ATN1, HTT, JPH3, AR, and DMPK) was assessed by single 
      and multiplex polymerase chain reaction, using fluorescently labeled primers, 
      followed by capillary electrophoresis. We used a family-centered approach, and 
      generalized estimating equations were used to account for AO correlation between 
      family members. RESULTS: For ATXN2, the presence of at least 1 allele longer than 
      22 CAGs was significantly associated with an earlier onset in TTR-FAP Val30Met, 
      decreasing mean AO by 6 years (95% confidence interval = -8.81 to -2.19, p = 
      0.001). No association was found for the remaining repeat loci. INTERPRETATION: 
      Length of normal repeats at ATXN2 may modify AO in TTR-FAP Val30Met and may 
      function as a risk factor. This can be due to the role of ATXN2 in RNA metabolism 
      and as a modulator of various cellular processes, including mitochondrial stress. 
      This may have relevant implications for prognosis and the follow-up of 
      presymptomatic carriers. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:251-258.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, characterised 
      by a triad of movement disorder, emotional and behavioural disturbances and 
      cognitive impairment. The underlying cause is an expanded CAG repeat in the 
      huntingtin gene. For a small proportion of patients presenting with HD-like 
      symptoms, the mutation in this gene is not identified and they are said to have a 
      HD "phenocopy". South Africa has the highest number of recorded cases of an 
      African-specific phenocopy, Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2), caused by a repeat 
      expansion in the junctophilin-3 gene. However, a significant proportion of black 
      patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of HD still test negative for HD and 
      HDL2. This study thus aimed to investigate five other loci associated with HD 
      phenocopy syndromes - ATN1, ATXN2, ATXN7, TBP and C9orf72. In a sample of 
      patients in whom HD and HDL2 had been excluded, a single expansion was identified 
      in the ATXN2 gene, confirming a diagnosis of Spinocerebellar ataxia 2. The 
      results indicate that common repeat expansion disorders do not contribute 
      significantly to the HD-like phenotype in black South African patients. 
      Importantly, allele sizing reveals unique distributions of normal repeat lengths 
      across the associated loci in the African population studied.

TI  - The Drosophila junctophilin gene is functionally equivalent to its four mammalian 
      counterparts and is a modifier of a Huntingtin poly-Q expansion and the Notch 
      pathway.
LID - 10.1242/dmm.029082 [doi]
LID - dmm029082
AB  - Members of the Junctophilin (JPH) protein family have emerged as key actors in 
      all excitable cells, with crucial implications for human pathophysiology. In 
      mammals, this family consists of four members (JPH1-JPH4) that are differentially 
      expressed throughout excitable cells. The analysis of knockout mice lacking JPH 
      subtypes has demonstrated their essential contribution to physiological functions 
      in skeletal and cardiac muscles and in neurons. Moreover, mutations in the human 
      JPH2 gene are associated with hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies; 
      mutations in JPH3 are responsible for the neurodegenerative Huntington's 
      disease-like-2 (HDL2), whereas JPH1 acts as a genetic modifier in 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2K peripheral neuropathy. Drosophila melanogaster has a 
      single junctophilin (jp) gene, as is the case in all invertebrates, which might 
      retain equivalent functions of the four homologous JPH genes present in mammalian 
      genomes. Therefore, owing to the lack of putatively redundant genes, a 
      jpDrosophila model could provide an excellent platform to model the 
      Junctophilin-related diseases, to discover the ancestral functions of the JPH 
      proteins and to reveal new pathways. By up- and downregulation of Jp in a 
      tissue-specific manner in Drosophila, we show that altering its levels of 
      expression produces a phenotypic spectrum characterized by muscular deficits, 
      dilated cardiomyopathy and neuronal alterations. Importantly, our study has 
      demonstrated that Jp modifies the neuronal degeneration in a Drosophila model of 
      Huntington's disease, and it has allowed us to uncover an unsuspected functional 
      relationship with the Notch pathway. Therefore, this Drosophila model has 
      revealed new aspects of Junctophilin function that can be relevant for the 
      disease mechanisms of their human counterparts.

AB  - Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2) is a rare autosomal dominant progressive 
      neurodegenerative disorder commonly seen in adults. It was first described in a 
      large African-American family in the United States. HDL2 clinically resembles 
      Huntington's disease (HD) and causes adult-onset relentlessly progressive 
      movement, emotional and cognitive dysfunction. Onset is usually in the fourth 
      decade with slow progression to death. We present a 47-year-old male Botswana 
      native, with a four-year-history of chorea, slurred speech, mood instability, 
      cognitive impairment and weight loss. Genetic testing reveals normal HTT gene but 
      a heterozygous expansion mutation at the JPH3 locus, confirmatory of HDL2. Though 
      some cases of HDL2 have been reported from neighboring South Africa, this is the 
      first instance from Botswana. This report draws attention to the fact that HDL2 
      exists among native Batswana, and even though clinically indistinguishable from 
      HD, molecular testing can result in positive case identification.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Huntington disease (HD), a prototypic monogenic disease, is caused by 
      an expanded CAG repeat in the HTT gene exceeding 35 units. However, not all 
      patients with an HD phenotype carry the pathological expansion in HTT, and the 
      positive diagnosis rate is poor. OBJECTIVES: To examine patients with HD 
      phenotypes to determine the frequency of HD phenocopies with typical features of 
      HD but without pathological CAG repeat expansions in HTT in an attempt to improve 
      the positive diagnosis rate. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between January 
      1, 2004, and April 18, 2011, a total of 226 consecutive index patients with an HD 
      phenotype were referred to specialized clinics of the French National Huntington 
      Disease Reference Centre for Rare Diseases. They underwent detailed clinical 
      examination and follow-up, as well as neuropsychological, biological, imaging, 
      and genetic examinations. Nucleotide expansions in JPH3, ATN1, TBP, and C9ORF72 
      and mutations in PRNP, as well as acquired conditions commonly causing HD 
      phenocopies, were first screened. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The diagnostic rate 
      of HD phenocopies and frequency of other etiologies using deep clinical 
      phenotyping and next generation sequencing. Our goal was to improve the genetic 
      diagnosis of HD phenocopies and to identify new HD related genes. RESULTS: One 
      hundred ninety-eight patients carried a pathological CAG repeat expansion in HTT, 
      whereas 28 patients (12 women and 16 men) did not. Huntington disease phenocopies 
      accounted for 12.4%, and their mean (SD) age at onset was similar to those of the 
      HD-HTT group (47.3 [12.7] years vs 50.3 [16.4] years, P = .29). We first 
      identified 3 patients with abnormal CTG expansions in JPH3, a fourth patient with 
      an antiphospholipid syndrome, and a fifth patient with B12 avitaminosis. A 
      custom-made 63-gene panel was generated based on clinical evolution and exome 
      sequencing. It contained genes responsible for HD phenocopies and other 
      neurodegenerative conditions, as well as candidate genes from exome sequencing in 
      3 index cases with imaging features of brain iron accumulation. We identified 
      mutations in genes associated with neurodegeneration, including CACNA1A (n = 2), 
      VPS13A (n = 1), UBQLN2 (n = 1), and VCP (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Huntington disease phenocopies without CAG repeat expansions in HTT are not rare, 
      occurring in 12.4% (28 of 226) herein, and should be considered in genetic 
      counseling. We used next-generation sequencing combined with clinical data and 
      disease evolution to explore multiple etiologies simultaneously. Our combined 
      clinical and genetic exploration of 28 HD phenocopies identified the underlying 
      cause in 35.7% (10 of 28). In conclusion, the etiologies of HD phenocopies are 
      heterogeneous, and clinical evolution should be taken into account when searching 
      for a genetic cause. The panel of candidate genes to be examined is larger than 
      expected but can be guided by specific imaging and clinical features. Other 
      neurodegenerative diseases with late onset in which variant segregation cannot be 
      verified could be productively explored with the combined approach illustrated 
      herein.

TI  - A Drosophila model of Huntington disease-like 2 exhibits nuclear toxicity and 
      distinct pathogenic mechanisms from Huntington disease.
PG  - 3164-3177
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddw166 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2) and Huntington disease (HD) are adult-onset 
      neurodegenerative diseases characterized by movement disorders, psychiatric 
      disturbances and cognitive decline. Brain tissue from HD and HDL2 patients shows 
      degeneration of the striatum and ubiquitinated inclusions immunoreactive for 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) antibodies. Despite these similarities, the diseases result 
      from different genetic mutations. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the 
      huntingtin (HTT) gene, while HDL2 results from an expansion at the junctophilin 3 
      (JPH3) locus. Recent evidence indicates that the HDL2 expansion may give rise to 
      a toxic polyQ protein translated from an antisense mRNA derived from the JPH3 
      locus. To investigate this hypothesis, we generated and characterized a 
      Drosophila HDL2 model and compared it with a previously established HD model. We 
      find that neuronal expression of HDL2-Q15 is not toxic, while the expression of 
      an expanded HDL2-Q138 protein is lethal. HDL2-Q138 forms large nuclear 
      aggregates, with only smaller puncta observed in the cytoplasm. This is in 
      contrast to what is observed in a Drosophila model of HD, where polyQ aggregates 
      localize exclusively to the cytoplasm. Altering localization of HLD2 with the 
      addition of a nuclear localization or nuclear export sequence demonstrates that 
      nuclear accumulation is required for toxicity in the Drosophila HDL2 model. 
      Directing HDL2-Q138 to the nucleus exacerbates toxicity in multiple tissue types, 
      while confining HDL2-Q138 to the cytoplasm restores viability to control levels. 
      We conclude that while HD and HDL2 have similar clinical profiles, distinct 
      pathogenic mechanisms are likely to drive toxicity in Drosophila models of these 
      disorders.

TI  - Junctophilin 3 (JPH3) expansion mutations causing Huntington disease like 2 
      (HDL2) are common in South African patients with African ancestry and a 
      Huntington disease phenotype.
PG  - 573-85
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32332 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder, characterized by abnormal movements, cognitive decline, and psychiatric 
      symptoms, caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene on 
      chromosome 4p. A CAG/CTG repeat expansion in the junctophilin-3 (JPH3) gene on 
      chromosome 16q24.2 causes a Huntington disease-like phenotype (HDL2). All 
      patients to date with HDL2 have some African ancestry. The present study aimed to 
      characterize the genetic basis of the Huntington disease phenotype in South 
      Africans and to investigate the possible origin of the JPH3 mutation. In a sample 
      of unrelated South African individuals referred for diagnostic HD testing, 62% 
      (106/171) of white patients compared to only 36% (47/130) of black patients had 
      an expansion in HTT. However, 15% (20/130) of black South African patients and no 
      white patients (0/171) had an expansion in JPH3, confirming the diagnosis of 
      Huntington disease like 2 (HDL2). Individuals with HDL2 share many clinical 
      features with individuals with HD and are clinically indistinguishable in many 
      cases, although the average age of onset and diagnosis in HDL2 is 5 years later 
      than HD and individual clinical features may be more prominent. HDL2 mutations 
      contribute significantly to the HD phenotype in South Africans with African 
      ancestry. JPH3 haplotype studies in 31 families, mainly from South Africa and 
      North America, provide evidence for a founder mutation and support a common 
      African origin for all HDL2 patients. Molecular testing in individuals with an HD 
      phenotype and African ancestry should include testing routinely for JPH3 
      mutations.

AB  - Intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions in ataxin 2 are a risk factor for 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The polyglutamine tract is encoded by a 
      trinucleotide repeat in a coding region of the ataxin 2 gene (ATXN2). Noncoding 
      nucleotide repeat expansions in several genes are also associated with 
      neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. For example, hexanucleotide repeat 
      expansions located in a noncoding region of C9ORF72 are the most common cause of 
      ALS. We sought to assess a potential larger role of noncoding nucleotide repeat 
      expansions in ALS. We analyzed the nucleotide repeat lengths of 6 genes (ATXN8, 
      ATXN10, PPP2R2B, NOP56, DMPK, and JPH3) that have previously been associated with 
      neurologic or neuromuscular disorders, in several hundred sporadic patients with 
      ALS and healthy control subjects. We report no association between ALS and repeat 
      length in any of these genes, suggesting that variation in the noncoding 
      repetitive regions in these genes does not contribute to ALS.

AB  - We report the clinical, neuropsychological, genetic, and radiological features of 
      a large five-generation African-American kindred from the southern USA presenting 
      with a progressive akinetic-rigid syndrome and severe dementia, but clinically 
      insignificant chorea, due to mutations in junctophillin 3 (JPH3). Overt disease 
      onset was in the mid-20s to late 30s with cognitive decline, REM sleep 
      disturbance, or psychiatric features, followed by development of a 
      levodopa-unresponsive akinetic-rigid motor syndrome. Dystonia and myoclonus were 
      present in some subjects. A bedridden, nonverbal severely akinetic-rigid state 
      developed within 10 to 15 years after onset. CTG repeat expansions ranged from 47 
      to 53. Imaging revealed generalized cerebral atrophy with severe striatal 
      involvement and putaminal rim hyperintensity. Analysis of our kindred indicates 
      that JPH3 mutations should be considered in the differential diagnosis of 
      early-onset dementia and hypokinetic-rigid syndromes in individuals of African 
      descent. Moreover, chorea may not be overtly manifest at presentation or during 
      significant parts of the disease course.

TI  - Loss of junctophilin-3 contributes to Huntington disease-like 2 pathogenesis.
PG  - 245-57
LID - 10.1002/ana.22598 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2) is a progressive, late onset 
      autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, with remarkable similarities to 
      Huntington disease (HD). HDL2 is caused by a CTG/CAG repeat expansion. In the CTG 
      orientation, the repeat is located within the alternatively spliced exon 2A of 
      junctophilin-3 (JPH3), potentially encoding polyleucine and polyalanine, whereas 
      on the strand antisense to JPH3, the repeat is in frame to encode polyglutamine. 
      The JPH3 protein product serves to stabilize junctional membrane complexes and 
      regulate neuronal calcium flux. We have previously demonstrated the potential 
      pathogenic properties of JPH3 transcripts containing expanded CUG repeats. The 
      aim of this study was to test the possibility that loss of JPH3 expression or 
      expanded amino acid tracts also contribute to HDL2 pathogenesis. METHODS: 
      Transcripts from the HDL2 locus, and their protein products, were examined in 
      HDL2, HD, and control frontal cortex. The effect of loss of Jph3 was examined in 
      mice with partial or complete loss of Jph3. RESULTS: Bidirectional transcription 
      occurs at the HDL2 locus, although expression of antisense transcripts with 
      expanded CAG repeats is limited. Protein products with expanded amino acid tracts 
      were not detected in HDL2 brain. However, JPH3 transcripts and full-length JPH3 
      protein are decreased in HDL2 brain, and Jph3 hemizygous and null mice exhibit 
      abnormal motor function. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that the pathogenic 
      mechanism of HDL2 is multifactorial, involving both a toxic gain of function of 
      JPH3 RNA and a toxic loss of JPH3 expression.

TI  - Genetic screening of Greek patients with Huntington's disease phenocopies 
      identifies an SCA8 expansion.
PG  - 1874-8
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a 
      triad of chorea, psychiatric disturbance and cognitive decline. Around 1% of 
      patients with HD-like symptoms lack the causative HD expansion and are considered 
      HD phenocopies. Genetic diseases that can present as HD phenocopies include 
      HD-like syndromes such as HDL1, HDL2 and HDL4 (SCA17), some spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCAs) and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). In this study we 
      screened a cohort of 21 Greek patients with HD phenocopy syndromes formutations 
      causing HDL2, SCA17, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3,SCA8, SCA12 and DRPLA. Fifteen patients 
      (71%) had a positive family history. We identified one patient (4.8% of the total 
      cohort) with an expansion of 81 combined CTA/CTG repeats at the SCA8 locus. This 
      falls within what is believed to be the high-penetrance allele range. In addition 
      to the classic HD triad, the patient had features of dystonia and oculomotor 
      apraxia. There were no cases of HDL2, SCA17, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA12 or DRPLA. 
      Given the controversy surrounding the SCA8 expansion, the present finding may be 
      incidental. However, if pathogenic, it broadens the phenotype that may be 
      associated with SCA8 expansions. The absence of any other mutations in our cohort 
      is not surprising, given the low probability of reaching a genetic diagnosis in 
      HD phenocopy patients.

TI  - An antisense CAG repeat transcript at JPH3 locus mediates expanded polyglutamine

PG  - 427-40
LID - 10.1016/j.neuron.2011.03.021 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease-like-2 (HDL2) is a phenocopy of Huntington's disease caused 
      by CTG/CAG repeat expansion at the Junctophilin-3 (JPH3) locus. The mechanisms 
      underlying HDL2 pathogenesis remain unclear. Here we developed a BAC transgenic 
      mouse model of HDL2 (BAC-HDL2) that exhibits progressive motor deficits, 
      selective neurodegenerative pathology, and ubiquitin-positive nuclear inclusions 
      (NIs). Molecular analyses reveal a promoter at the transgene locus driving the 
      expression of a CAG repeat transcript (HDL2-CAG) from the strand antisense to 
      JPH3, which encodes an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) protein. Importantly, 
      BAC-HDL2 mice, but not control BAC mice, accumulate polyQ-containing NIs in a 
      pattern strikingly similar to those in the patients. Furthermore, BAC mice with 
      genetic silencing of the expanded CUG transcript still express HDL2-CAG 
      transcript and manifest polyQ pathogenesis. Finally, studies of HDL2 mice and 
      patients revealed CBP sequestration into NIs and evidence for interference of 
      CBP-mediated transcriptional activation. These results suggest overlapping 
      polyQ-mediated pathogenic mechanisms in HD and HDL2.

AB  - Huntington's disease like-2 (HDL-2) neurodegeneration is a recently described 
      autosomal dominant disorder with features similar to Huntington's disease (HD). 
      Only one case report has described neuropathology from an affected patient. We 
      describe the clinical presentation and illustrate the pathology in two additional 
      molecularly confirmed patients, compare these with the previously published case, 
      and contrast them with HD. We examined two patients with HDL-2. Their charts were 
      reviewed, their brains were examined using standard neuropathology techniques, 
      including immunoperoxidase stains, and their diagnoses were confirmed with a 
      PCR-based assay for repeat length. The first patient presented with obsessive 
      suspiciousness, while the second had depression and decreased visual acuity. Both 
      patients developed increased tone and cogwheel rigidity, but neither developed 
      choreoathetosis. Extensive degeneration affected the caudate nucleus and putamen, 
      especially dorsally and laterally. In addition, the first patient showed lateral 
      temporal, lateral frontal, and orbitofrontal cortical atrophy, while the second 
      patient displayed marked degeneration in the occipital and parietal cortices. 
      Neither patient showed significant changes in the cerebellum or brainstem. Both 
      cases had ubiquitin-immunoreactive neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NII). The 
      patients with of HDL-2 reviewed here were remarkable for significant frontal 
      inhibition with parkinsonism, a lack of choreiform movements, and African 
      ancestry. Pathologically, HDL-2 is similar to HD in its effect on the neostriatum 
      but may differ, at least in some cases, in its degree of focal cortical 
      involvement, including the occipital lobe.

TI  - Exclusion of mutations in the PRNP, JPH3, TBP, ATN1, CREBBP, POU3F2 and FTL genes 
      as a cause of disease in Portuguese patients with a Huntington-like phenotype.
PG  - 645-651
LID - 10.1007/s10038-006-0001-9 [doi]
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterised by chorea, cognitive impairment, dementia and personality changes, 
      caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the HD gene. Often, patients with a 
      similar clinical presentation do not carry expansions of the CAG repeat in this 
      gene [Huntington disease-like (HDL) patients]. We report the genetic analysis of 
      107 Portuguese patients with an HDL phenotype. The HDL genes PRNP and JPH3, 
      encoding the prion protein and junctophilin-3, respectively, were screened for 
      repeat expansions in these patients. Given the partial clinical overlap of SCA17, 
      DRPLA and neuroferritinopathy with HD, their causative genes (TBP, ATN1, and FTL, 
      respectively) were also analysed. Finally, repeat expansions in two candidate 
      genes, CREBBP and POU3F2, which encode the nuclear transcriptional coactivator 
      CREB-binding protein and the CNS-specific transcription factor N-Oct-3, 
      respectively, were also studied. Expansions of the repetitive tracts of the PRNP, 
      JPH3, TBP, ATN1, CREBBP and POU3F2 genes were excluded in all patients, as were 
      sequence alterations in the FTL gene. Since none of the genes already included in 
      the differential diagnosis of HD was responsible for the disease in our sample, 
      the genetic heterogeneity of the HDL phenotype is still open for investigation.

TI  - Yugoslav HD phenocopies analyzed on the presence of mutations in PrP, ferritin, 
      and Jp-3 genes.
PG  - 299-301
AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a well-defined autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by CAG repeat expansions in HD gene. There are a significant 
      number of HD cases where this mutation was not found and such cases are named 
      HD-like phenotype (HDL). This article reports 48 patients with HDL phenotype. 
      Patients were analyzed on the presence of mutations in prion (PrP), ferritin and 
      junctophilin-3 (JP-3) genes. None of the patients showed the presence of the 
      mutation in analyzed genes. This could suggest that there is some other 
      gene/genes where the mutation can cause the disease with clinical features of HD.

TI  - Huntington's Disease-like 2 (HDL2) in North America and Japan.
PG  - 670-4
AB  - Huntington's Disease-like 2 (HDL2) is a progressive, autosomal dominant, 
      neurodegenerative disorder with marked clinical and pathological similarities to 
      Huntington's disease (HD). The causal mutation is a CTG/CAG expansion mutation on 
      chromosome 16q24.3, in a variably spliced exon of junctophilin-3. The frequency 
      of HDL2 was determined in nine independent series of patients referred for HD 
      testing or selected for the presence of an HD-like phenotype in North America or 
      Japan. The repeat length, ancestry, and age of onset of all North American HDL2 
      cases were determined. The results show that HDL2 is very rare, with a frequency 
      of 0 to 15% among patients in the nine case series with an HD-like presentation 
      who do not have the HD mutation. HDL2 is predominantly, and perhaps exclusively, 
      found in individuals of African ancestry. Repeat expansions ranged from 44 to 57 
      triplets, with length instability in maternal transmission detected in a repeat 
      of r2=0.29, p=0.0098). The results further support the evidence that the repeat 
      expansion at the chromosome 16q24.3 locus is the direct cause of HDL2 and provide 
      preliminary guidelines for the genetic testing of patients with an HD-like 
      phenotype.

AB  - Three patients from a previously described family with autosomal dominant 
      chorea-acanthocytosis were found to have the CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      mutation of the junctophilin-3 gene associated with Huntington's disease-like 2 
      (HDL2). One of six previously identified patients with HDL2 had acanthocytosis on

TI  - Huntington's disease-like phenotype due to trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 
      TBP and JPH3 genes.
PG  - 1599-603
AB  - We report a group of 252 patients with a Huntington's disease-like (HDL) 
      phenotype, including 60 with typical Huntington's disease, who had tested 
      negative for pathological expansions in the IT15 gene, the major mutation in 
      Huntington's disease. They were screened for repeat expansions in two other genes 
      involved in HDL phenotypes: those encoding the junctophilin-3 (JPH3/HDL2) and 
      prion (PRNP/HDL1) proteins. In addition, because of the clinical overlap between 
      patients with HDL disease and autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia or 
      dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), we investigated trinucleotide 
      repeat expansions in genes encoding the TATA-binding protein (TBP/SCA17) and 
      atrophin-1 (DRPLA). Two patients carried 43 and 50 uninterrupted CTG repeats in 
      the JPH3 gene. Two other patients had 44 and 46 CAA/CAG repeats in the TBP gene. 
      Patients with expansions in the TBP or JPH3 genes had HDL phenotypes 
      indistinguishable from Huntington's disease. Taking into account patients with 
      typical Huntington's disease, their frequencies were evaluated as 3% each in our 
      series of typical HDL patients. Interestingly, incomplete penetrance of the 46 
      CAA/CAG repeat in the TBP gene was observed in a 59-year-old transmitting, but 
      healthy, parent. Furthermore, we report a new configuration of the expanded TBP 
      allele, with 11 repeats on the first polymorphic stretch of CAGs. Expansions in 
      the DRPLA gene and insertions in the PRNP gene were not found in our group of 
      patients. Further genetic heterogeneity of the HDL phenotype therefore exists.

TI  - Motor discoordination in mutant mice lacking junctophilin type 3.
PG  - 318-24
AB  - Junctional complexes between the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 
      often called "subsurface cisternae" or "peripheral coupling," are shared by 
      excitable cells. These junctional membranes probably provide structural 
      foundation for functional crosstalk between cell-surface and intracellular ionic 
      channels. Our current studies have indicated that junctophilins (JPs) take part 
      in the formation of junctional membrane complexes by spanning the ER membrane and 
      interacting with the plasma membrane. Of the JP subtypes defined, JP type 3 
      (JP-3) is specifically expressed in neurons in the brain. It has been currently 
      reported that triplet repeat expansions in the JP-3 gene are associated with 
      Huntington's disease-like symptoms including motor disorder in human. To survey 
      the physiological role of JP-3, we generated the knockout mice. The JP-3-knockout 
      mice grew and reproduced normally, and we did not observe any morphological 
      abnormality in the mutant brain. In the behavioral study, the mutant mice showed 
      impaired performance specifically in balance/motor coordination tasks. Although 
      obvious defects could not be observed in excitatory transmission among cerebellar 
      neurons from the mutant mice, the data indicate that JP-3 plays an active role in 
      certain neurons involved in motor coordination.

      Huntington disease-like 2.
PG  - 377-8
AB  - We recently described a disorder termed Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2) that 
      completely segregates with an unidentified CAG/CTG expansion in a large pedigree 
      (W). We now report the cloning of this expansion and its localization to a 
      variably spliced exon of JPH3 (encoding junctophilin-3), a gene involved in the 
      formation of junctional membrane structures.
