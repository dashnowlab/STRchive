AB  - There is an obvious clinical-pathological overlap between essential tremor and 
      some known tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansion disorders. The aim is 
      to analyse whether these short tandem repeat genes, including ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, TBP, BEAN1, NOP56, DAB1, ATN1, 
      SADM12 and FMR1, are associated with familial essential tremor patients. Genetic 
      analysis of repeat sizes in tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansions was 
      performed in a large cohort of 515 familial essential tremor probands and 300 
      controls. The demographic and clinical features among carriers of pathogenic 
      expansions, intermediate repeats and non-carriers were compared. A total of 18 
      out of 515 (18/515, 3.7%) patients were found to have repeats expansions, 
      including 12 cases (12/515, 2.5%) with intermediate repeat expansions (one ATXN1, 
      eight TBP, two FMR1, one ATN1), and six cases (6/515, 1.2%) with pathogenic 
      expansions (one ATXN1, one ATXN2, one ATXN8OS, one PPP2R2B, one FMR1, one 
      SAMD12). There were no statistically significant differences in intermediate 
      repeats compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, there were no significant 
      differences in demographics and clinical features among individuals with 
      pathogenic expansions, intermediate repeat expansions carriers and non-carriers. 
      Our study indicates that the intermediate repeat expansion in tremor-associated 
      short tandem repeat expansions does not pose an increased risk for essential 
      tremor, and rare pathogenic expansion carriers have been found in the familial 
      essential tremor cohort. The diagnosis of essential tremor based solely on 
      clinical symptoms remains a challenge in distinguishing it from known short 
      tandem repeat expansions diseases with overlapping clinical-pathological 
      features.

AB  - Neurologists have a difficult time identifying sporadic cerebellar ataxia. 
      Multiple system atrophy of the cerebellar type (MSA-C), spontaneous late cortical 
      cerebellar atrophy, and prolonged alcohol use are a few possible causes. In a 
      group of people with sporadic cerebellar ataxia that was not MSA-C, an 
      autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) mutation was recently discovered. 
      Chinese single-hospital cohort will be used in this study to genetic screen for 
      SCA-related genes. One hundred forty individuals with CA were monitored over 8 
      years. Thirty-one individuals had familial CA, 109 patients had sporadic CA, 73 
      had MSA-C, and 36 had non-MSA-C sporadic CA. In 28 of the 31 non-MSA-C sporadic 
      patients who requested the test, we carried out gene analysis, including SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, SCA31, and 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The control group consisted of 
      family members of the patients. In 57% of the instances with spontaneous CA that 
      were not MSA-C, gene abnormalities were discovered. The most frequent exception 
      among individuals with sporadic CA was SCA6 (36%), followed by monsters in SCA1, 
      2, 3, 8, and DRPLA. In contrast, 75% of the patients with familial CA had gene 
      abnormalities, the most frequent of which was SCA6 abnormality. The age of 69 vs 
      59 was higher, and the CAG repeat length was a minor age of 23 vs 25 in the 
      former instances compared to the last one among individuals with SCA6 anomalies 
      that were sporadic as opposed to familial cases. In sporadic CA, 
      autosomal-dominant mutations in SCA genes, notably in SCA6, are common. Although 
      the cause of the increased incidence of SCA6 mutations is unknown, it may be 
      related to a greater age of onset and varied penetrance of SCA6 mutations.

AB  - In Japan, approximately 30% of spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) is hereditary, 
      and more than 90% of hereditary SCD is autosomal dominant SCD (AD-SCD). We have 
      previously reported the types of AD-SCD in Hokkaido, twice. In this study, we 
      investigated the status of AD-SCD mainly due to repeat expansions, covering the 
      period since the last report. We performed genetic analysis for 312 patients with 
      a clinical diagnosis of SCD, except for multiple system atrophy at medical 
      institutions in Hokkaido between January 2007 and December 2020. The median age 
      at the time of analysis was 58 (1-86) years. Pathogenic variants causing AD-SCD 
      due to repeat expansion were found in 61.5% (192 cases). Spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) 6 was the most common type in 25.3% (79 cases), followed by Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD)/SCA3 in 13.8% (43), SCA1 in 6.4% (20), SCA2 in 5.1% (16), SCA31 in 
      4.8% (15), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy in 4.8% (15), SCA7 in 0.6% (2), 
      and SCA8 in 0.6% (2). SCA17, 27B, 36, and 37 were not found. Compared to previous 
      reports, this study found a higher prevalence of SCA6 and a lower prevalence of 
      MJD/SCA3. An increasing number of cases identified by genetic testing, including 
      cases with no apparent family history, accurately revealed the distribution of 
      disease types in Hokkaido.

AB  - Non-coding repeat expansion causes several neurodegenerative diseases, such as 
      fragile X syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia, and 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA31). Such repetitive sequences must be investigated to 
      understand disease mechanisms and prevent them, using novel approaches. However, 
      synthesizing repeat sequences from synthetic oligonucleotides is challenging as 
      they are unstable, lack unique sequences, and exhibit propensity to make 
      secondary structures. Synthesizing long repeat sequence using polymerase chain 
      reaction is often difficult due to lack of unique sequence. Here, we employed a 
      rolling circle amplification technique to obtain seamless long repeat sequences 
      using tiny synthetic single-stranded circular DNA as template. We obtained 
      2.5-3 kbp uninterrupted TGGAA repeats, which is observed in SCA31, and confirmed 
      it using restriction digestion, Sanger and Nanopore sequencing. This cell-free, 
      in vitro cloning method may be applicable for other repeat expansion diseases and 
      be used to produce animal and cell culture models to study repeat expansion 
      diseases in vivo and in vitro.

      spinocerebellar ataxia type 10.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal-dominant disorder caused 
      by an expanded pentanucleotide repeat in the ATXN10 gene. This repeat expansion, 
      when fully penetrant, has a size of 850-4,500 repeats. It has been shown that the 
      repeat composition can be a modifier of disease, e.g., seizures. Here, we 
      describe a Mexican kindred in which we identified both pure (ATTCT)(n) and mixed 
      (ATTCT)(n)-(ATTCC)(n) expansions in the same family. We used amplification-free 
      targeted sequencing and optical genome mapping to decipher the composition of 
      these repeat expansions. We found a considerable degree of mosaicism of the 
      repeat expansion. This mosaicism was confirmed in skin fibroblasts from 
      individuals with ATXN10 expansions with RNAScope in situ hybridization. All 
      affected family members with the mixed ATXN10 repeat expansion showed typical 
      clinical signs of spinocerebellar ataxia and epilepsy. In contrast, individuals 
      with the pure ATXN10 expansion present with Parkinson's disease or are 
      unaffected, even in individuals more than 20 years older than the average age at 
      onset for SCA10. Our findings suggest that the pure (ATTCT)(n) expansion is 
      non-pathogenic, while repeat interruptions, e.g., (ATTCC)(n), are necessary to 
      cause SCA10. This mechanism has been recently described for several other repeat 
      expansions including SCA31 (BEAN1), SCA37 (DAB1), and three loci for benign adult 
      familial myoclonic epilepsy BAFME (SAMD12, TNRC6A, RAPGEF2). Therefore, long-read 
      sequencing and optical genome mapping of the entire genomic structure of repeat 
      expansions are critical for clinical practice and genetic counseling, as 
      variations in the repeat can affect disease penetrance, symptoms, and disease 
      trajectory.

TI  - Thymidine Kinase 2 and Mitochondrial Protein COX I in the Cerebellum of Patients 
      with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 31 Caused by Penta-nucleotide Repeats 
      (TTCCA)(n).
PG  - 70-84

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 (SCA31), an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia with Purkinje cell 
      degeneration, is caused by a heterozygous 2.5-3.8 kilobase penta-nucleotide 
      repeat of (TTCCA)(n) in intron 11 of the thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) gene. TK2 is an 
      essential mitochondrial pyrimidine-deoxyribonucleoside kinase. Bi-allelic 
      loss-of-function mutations of TK2 lead to mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 
      (MDS) in humans through severe (~ 70%) reduction of mitochondrial 
      electron-transport-chain activity, and tk2 knockout mice show Purkinje cell 
      degeneration and ataxia through severe mitochondrial cytochrome-c oxidase subunit 
      I (COX I) protein reduction. To clarify whether TK2 function is altered in SCA31, 
      we investigated TK2 and COX I expression in human postmortem SCA31 cerebellum. We 
      confirmed that canonical TK2 mRNA is transcribed from exons far upstream of the 
      repeat site, and demonstrated that an extended version of TK2 mRNA ("TK2-EXT"), 
      transcribed from exons spanning the repeat site, is expressed in human 
      cerebellum. While canonical TK2 was conserved among vertebrates, TK2-EXT was 
      specific to primates. Reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that both TK2 mRNAs 
      were preserved in SCA31 cerebella compared with control cerebella. The TK2 
      proteins, assessed with three different antibodies including our original 
      polyclonal antibody against TK2-EXT, were detected as ~ 26 kilodalton proteins on 
      western blot; their levels were similar in SCA31 and control cerebella. COX I 
      protein level was preserved in SCA31 compared to nuclear DNA-encoded protein. We 
      conclude that the expression and function of TK2 are preserved in SCA31, 
      suggesting a mechanism distinct from that of MDS.

TI  - Midbrain atrophy related to parkinsonism in a non-coding repeat expansion

      dopaminergic dysfunction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 (SCA31) is caused by non-coding 
      pentanucleotide repeat expansions in the BEAN1 gene. Clinically, SCA31 is 
      characterized by late adult-onset, pure cerebellar ataxia. To explore the 
      association between parkinsonism and SCA31, five patients with SCA31 with 
      concomitant nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction (NSDD) development, including 
      three cases of L-DOPA responsive parkinsonism, were analyzed. METHODS: To assess 
      regional brain atrophy, cross-sectional and longitudinal imaging analyses were 
      retrospectively performed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) planimetry. The 
      midbrain-to-pons (M/P) area ratio and cerebellar area were measured on 
      midsagittal T1-weighted MRI in five patients with SCA31 with concomitant NSDD 
      (NSDD(+)), 14 patients with SCA31 without NSDD (NSDD(-)), 32 patients with 
      Parkinson's disease (PD), and 15 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy 
      (PSP). Longitudinal changes in the M/P area ratio were assessed by serial MRI of 
      NSDD(+) (n = 5) and NSDD(-) (n = 9). RESULTS: The clinical characteristics 
      assessed in the five patients with NSDD were as follows: the mean age at NSDD 
      onset (72.0 +/- 10.8 years), prominence of bradykinesia/akinesia (5/5), rigidity 
      (4/5), tremor (2/5), dysautonomia (0/5), vertical gaze limitation (1/5), and 
      abnormalities on (123)I-ioflupane dopamine transporter scintigraphy (3/3) and 
      3-Tesla neuromelanin MRI (4/4). A clear reduction in the midbrain area and the 
      M/P area ratio was observed in the NSDD(+) group (p < 0.05) while there was no 
      significant difference in disease duration or in the pons area among the NSDD(+), 
      NSDD(-), and PD groups. There was also a significant difference in the midbrain 
      and pons area between NSDD(+) and PSP (p < 0.05). Thus, mild but significant 
      midbrain atrophy was observed in NSDD(+). A faster rate of decline in the 
      midbrain area and the M/P area ratio was evident in NSDD(+) (p < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: The clinical characteristics of the five patients with SCA31 with 
      concomitant NSDD, together with the topographical pattern of atrophy, were 
      inconsistent with PD, PSP, and multiple system atrophy, suggesting that SCA31 may 
      manifest NSDD in association with the pathomechanisms underlying SCA31.

AB  - Synthetic small molecules modulating RNA structure and function have therapeutic 
      potential for RNA diseases. Here we report our discovery that naphthyridine 
      carbamate dimer (NCD) targets disease-causing r(UGGAA)(n) repeat RNAs in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 (SCA31). Structural analysis of the 
      NCD-UGGAA/UGGAA complex by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy 
      clarifies the mode of binding that recognizes four guanines in the UGGAA/UGGAA 
      pentad by hydrogen bonding with four naphthyridine moieties of two NCD molecules. 
      Biological studies show that NCD disrupts naturally occurring RNA foci built on 
      r(UGGAA)(n) repeat RNA known as nuclear stress bodies (nSBs) by interfering with 
      RNA-protein interactions resulting in the suppression of nSB-mediated splicing 
      events. Feeding NCD to larvae of the Drosophila model of SCA31 alleviates 
      the disease phenotype induced by toxic r(UGGAA)(n) repeat RNA. These studies 
      demonstrate that small molecules targeting toxic repeat RNAs are a promising 
      chemical tool for studies on repeat expansion diseases.

TI  - Long-read sequencing identifies the pathogenic nucleotide repeat expansion in 
      RFC1 in a Japanese case of CANVAS.

AB  - Recently, a recessively inherited intronic repeat expansion in replication factor 
      C1 (RFC1) was identified in cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). Here, we describe a Japanese case of 
      genetically confirmed CANVAS with autonomic failure and auditory hallucination. 
      The case showed impaired uptake of iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine and 
      (123)I-ioflupane in the cardiac sympathetic nerve and dopaminergic neurons, 
      respectively, by single-photon emission computed tomography. Long-read sequencing 
      identified biallelic pathogenic (AAGGG)n nucleotide repeat expansion in RFC1 and 
      heterozygous benign (TAAAA)n and (TAGAA)n expansions in brain expressed, 
      associated with NEDD4 (BEAN1). Enrichment of the repeat regions in RFC1 and BEAN1 
      using a Cas9-mediated system clearly distinguished between pathogenic and benign 
      repeat expansions. The haplotype around RFC1 indicated that the (AAGGG)n 
      expansion in our case was on the same ancestral allele as that of European cases. 
      Thus, long-read sequencing facilitates precise genetic diagnosis of diseases with 
      complex repeat structures and various expansions.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10): Mutation analysis and common haplotype 
      based inference suggest its rarity in Indian population.
PG  - 100211
LID - 10.1016/j.ensci.2019.100211 [doi]
LID - 100211
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a rare autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia caused by nucleotide ATTCT expansion in ATXN10 gene. SCA10 has been 
      reported in patients of cerebellar ataxia from Amerindian/Latin America and in 
      East Asian ancestry. A common founder has been ascribed to the origin of ATTCT 
      repeat expansion mutation in both the population. Here we present our 
      investigation of the SCA10 pentanucleotide repeat expansion in 461 SCA patients 
      of the Indian population. The analysis of multi-ethnic at-risk haplotype 
      C-(ATTCT)n-GGC was performed using genotype data of various ethnic population 
      included in the 1000 Genomes Project (KGP) to infer the prevalence of at-risk 
      haplotype in the Indian populations. Unsurprisingly, none of the patient's DNA 
      samples with (ATTCT)n expansion was observed in pathological range, however, the 
      observed normal range of (ATTCT)n was 8-22 repeats, suggesting very rare or 
      absence of the occurrence of SCA10 in Indian SCA patients. The at-risk haplotype, 
      CGGC was found to be the most prevalent haplotype across different populations 
      and no segregation of CGGC haplotype with large normal or small normal ATTCT 
      repeats length was observed. However, on extended haplotype analysis, some 
      lineage of CGGC with a flanking divergence at 5' end was observed specifically in 
      the American or East Asian population but not in other population in KGP dataset. 
      Together, these evidence points towards the absence of SCA10 in Indian population 
      and haplotype-based analysis also suggests its occurrence to be rare in South 
      Asian, European and African population. Further investigations are required to 
      establish the present finding. SIGNIFICANCE: The implications of the findings of 
      this study are 1.) For the diagnostic work-up of SCAs in the Indian population 
      and to decide upon inclusion of SCA10 in panel based genetic investigations even 
      for Indians living abroad. 2.) The haplotype based inference of its presumptive 
      prevalence through the estimation of at-risk haplotype using population genetics 
      approach (South-Asians as the background) allowed us to estimate the possible 
      absence of SCA10 in Indian population. SCA10 is a rare autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia mostly reported among SCA patients from Latin America and 
      recently described in East Asia population. The genetic study of SCA10 performed 
      in the unrelated Indian spinocerebellar ataxia patients with heterogeneous 
      ethnicity confirmed its absence from the Indian population and that conforms to 
      population genetic based inference of its rarity or absence. 3.) This approach 
      may be adopted for the screening of other subtypes of SCAs, i.e. other rare SCAs 
      e.g. SCA31, SCA36, and SCA37.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8), an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder showing slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, is caused by a 
      tri-nucleotide CTG repeat expansion (CTGexp) in the SCA8 gene. As the CTGexp is 
      not fully penetrant, the significance of screening CTGexp in ataxia subjects 
      remains obscure. We tested SCA8 CTGexp in a cohort of 797 ataxia subjects, and if 
      present, its sequence configuration was analyzed. CTGexp was found in 16 alleles 
      from 14 individuals, 2 of which was homozygous for CTGexp. Nucleotide sequencing 
      disclosed 3 types of CTGexp sequence configurations: uninterrupted CTGexp, 
      tri-nucleotide CTA interruption and CCG interruption. The 2 individuals with 
      homozygous expansions were both sporadic cases with clinical features compatible 
      with SCA8, supporting gene dosage effect. Seven out of 14 CTGexp-positive 
      subjects were also carriers of other SCA expansions [Machado-Joseph disease 
      (n=1), SCA6 (n=3) and SCA31 (n=3)], whereas 7 others were not complicated with 
      such major SCAs. Ages of onset in subjects with pure CTGexp tended to be earlier 
      than those with interrupted CTGexp among the 7 subjects not complicated by major 
      SCAs, suggesting that pure CTGexp have stronger pathogenic effect than 
      interrupted CTGexps. The present study underscores importance of disclosing 
      sequence configuration when testing SCA8.

AB  - Microsatellite expansion disorders are pathologically characterized by RNA foci 
      formation and repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. However, their 
      underlying pathomechanisms and regulation of RAN translation remain unknown. We 
      report that expression of expanded UGGAA (UGGAA(exp)) repeats, responsible for 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 (SCA31) in Drosophila, causes neurodegeneration 
      accompanied by accumulation of UGGAA(exp) RNA foci and translation of 
      repeat-associated pentapeptide repeat (PPR) proteins, consistent with 
      observations in SCA31 patient brains. We revealed that motor-neuron disease 
      (MND)-linked RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), TDP-43, FUS, and hnRNPA2B1, bind to and 
      induce structural alteration of UGGAA(exp). These RBPs suppress 
      UGGAA(exp)-mediated toxicity in Drosophila by functioning as RNA chaperones for 
      proper UGGAA(exp) folding and regulation of PPR translation. Furthermore, 
      nontoxic short UGGAA repeat RNA suppressed mutated RBP aggregation and toxicity 
      in MND Drosophila models. Thus, functional crosstalk of the RNA/RBP network 
      regulates their own quality and balance, suggesting convergence of 
      pathomechanisms in microsatellite expansion disorders and RBP proteinopathies.

TI  - Rapid detection of expanded short tandem repeats in personal genomics using 
      hybrid sequencing.
PG  - 815-22
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btt647 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Long expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs), i.e. DNA repeats of 
      2-6 nt, are associated with some genetic diseases. Cost-efficient high-throughput 
      sequencing can quickly produce billions of short reads that would be useful for 
      uncovering disease-associated STRs. However, enumerating STRs in short reads 
      remains largely unexplored because of the difficulty in elucidating STRs much 
      longer than 100 bp, the typical length of short reads. RESULTS: We propose ab 
      initio procedures for sensing and locating long STRs promptly by using the 
      frequency distribution of all STRs and paired-end read information. We validated 
      the reproducibility of this method using biological replicates and used it to 
      locate an STR associated with a brain disease (SCA31). Subsequently, we sequenced 
      this STR site in 11 SCA31 samples using SMRT(TM) sequencing (Pacific 
      Biosciences), determined 2.3-3.1 kb sequences at nucleotide resolution and 
      revealed that (TGGAA)- and (TAAAATAGAA)-repeat expansions determined the 
      instability of the repeat expansions associated with SCA31. Our method could also 
      identify common STRs, (AAAG)- and (AAAAG)-repeat expansions, which are remarkably 
      expanded at four positions in an SCA31 sample. This is the first proposed method 
      for rapidly finding disease-associated long STRs in personal genomes using hybrid 
      sequencing of short and long reads. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Our TRhist 
      software is available at http://trhist.gi.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/. CONTACT:

TI  - Abnormal RNA structures (RNA foci) containing a penta-nucleotide repeat (UGGAA)n 
      in the Purkinje cell nucleus is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 
      pathogenesis.
PG  - 600-11
LID - 10.1111/neup.12032 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 (SCA31) is an autosomal-dominant cerebellar ataxia 
      showing a Purkinje cell (PC)-predominant neurodegeneration in humans. The 
      mutation is a complex penta-nucleotide repeat containing (TGGAA)n , (TAGAA)n , 
      (TAAAA)n and (TAGAATAAAA)n inserted in an intron shared by two different genes 
      BEAN1 and TK2 located in the long arm of the human chromosome 16. Previous 
      studies have shown that (TGGAA)n is the critical component of SCA31 pathogenesis 
      while the three other repeats, also present in normal Japanese, are not 
      essential. Importantly, it has been shown that BEAN1 and TK2 are transcribed in 
      mutually opposite directions in the human brain. Furthermore, abnormal RNA 
      structures called "RNA foci" are observed by a probe against (UAGAAUAAAA)n in 
      SCA31 patients' PC nuclei, indicating that the BEAN1-direction mutant transcript 
      appears instrumental for the pathogenesis. However, it is not known whether the 
      critical repeat (TGGAA)n contributes to the formation of RNA foci, neither do we 
      understand how the RNA foci formation is relevant to the pathogenesis. To address 
      these issues, we investigated two SCA31 cerebella by fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization using a probe against (UGGAA)n . We also asked whether the mutant 
      BEAN1-transcript containing (UGGAA)n exerts toxicity compared to the other three 
      repeats in cultured cells. Histopathologically, we confirm that the PC is the 
      main target of SCA31 pathogenesis. We find that the RNA foci containing (UGGAA)n 
      are indeed observed in PC nuclei of both SCA31 patients, whereas similar foci 
      were not observed in control individuals. In both transiently and stably 
      expressed cultured cell models, we also find that the mutation transcribed in the 
      BEAN1-direction yields more toxicity than control transcripts and forms RNA foci 
      detected with probes against (UGGAA)n and (UAGAAUAAAA)n . Taking these findings 
      together, we conclude that the RNA foci containing BEAN1-direction transcript 
      (UGGAA)n are associated with PC degeneration in SCA31.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 is associated with "inserted" penta-nucleotide 
      repeats containing (TGGAA)n.
PG  - 544-57
LID - 10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.09.019 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 (SCA31) is an adult-onset autosomal-dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder showing progressive cerebellar ataxia mainly affecting 
      Purkinje cells. The SCA31 critical region was tracked down to a 900 kb interval 
      in chromosome 16q22.1, where the disease shows a strong founder effect. By 
      performing comprehensive Southern blot analysis and BAC- and fosmid-based 
      sequencing, we isolated two genetic changes segregating with SCA31. One was a 
      single-nucleotide change in an intron of the thymidine kinase 2 gene (TK2). 
      However, this did not appear to affect splicing or expression patterns. The other 
      was an insertion, from 2.5-3.8 kb long, consisting of complex penta-nucleotide 
      repeats including a long (TGGAA)n stretch. In controls, shorter (1.5-2.0 kb) 
      insertions lacking (TGGAA)n were found only rarely. The SCA31 repeat insertion's 
      length inversely correlated with patient age of onset, and an expansion was 
      documented in a single family showing anticipation. The repeat insertion was 
      located in introns of TK2 and BEAN (brain expressed, associated with Nedd4) 
      expressed in the brain and formed RNA foci in the nuclei of patients' Purkinje 
      cells. An electrophoretic mobility-shift assay showed that essential splicing 
      factors, serine/arginine-rich splicing factors SFRS1 and SFRS9, bind to (UGGAA)n 
      in vitro. Because (TGGAA)n is a characteristic sequence of paracentromeric 
      heterochromatin, we speculate that the insertion might have originated from 
      heterochromatin. SCA31 is important because it exemplifies human diseases 
      associated with "inserted" microsatellite repeats that can expand through 
      transmission. Our finding suggests that the ectopic microsatellite repeat, when 
      transcribed, might cause a disease involving the essential splicing factors.
