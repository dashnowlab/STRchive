AB  - BACKGROUND: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is a rare hereditary muscle 
      disease characterized by progressive ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, dysphagia, 
      dysarthria, and distal muscle weakness. The genetic basis was identified in 2019 
      with CGG repeat expansions in the noncoding region of LRP12. Similar expansions 
      in GIPC1, NOTCH2NLC, and RILPL1 were later linked to OPDM, classifying the 
      disease into OPDM1-4. OPDM4, associated with RILPL1, was discovered in 2022 with 
      a few confirmed cases worldwide, leaving its clinical features and pathogenic 
      mechanisms largely unexplored. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a patient with OPDM4 
      who had suffered progressive ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, pharyngeal 
      weakness, facial muscle weakness, and distal limb weakness over the past 
      20 years. Electromyography (EMG) revealed myogenic damage and normal H-reflex 
      latency. A biopsy of the left biceps brachii revealed myogenic changes with 
      atypical rimmed vacuoles in some muscle fibers. Screening for extra-muscular 
      system involvement revealed no obvious involvement of the heart or central 
      nervous system. Genetic analysis confirmed 126 CGG repeat expansions in RILPL1 
      and excluded abnormal CGG repeat expansions in LRP12, GIPC1, and NOTCH2NLC. 
      CONCLUSION: This case broadens the spectrum of CGG repeat numbers in the RILPL1 
      gene associated with OPDM4. In addition, systematic medical examinations revealed 
      several new characteristics of OPDM4, which have not been reported previously, 
      such as normal H reflex, potential mild cognitive impairment, etc. These findings 
      expand our knowledge of the phenotypic spectrum of diseases caused by repeat CGG 
      expansions in RILPL1.

AB  - The CGG repeat expansions in the 5'-UTR regions of certain genes have been 
      implicated in various neurodegenerative and muscular disorders. However, the 
      underlying pathogenic mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we 
      explore the role of the small molecular chaperone HSPB1 in counteracting 
      neurodegeneration induced by poly-glycine (poly-G) aggregates. Employing a 
      reporter system, we demonstrate that CGG repeat expansions within the 5'-UTR of 
      the GIPC1 gene produce poly-G proteins, by repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) 
      translation. Through proximity labeling and subsequent mass spectrometry 
      analysis, we characterize the composition of poly-G insoluble aggregates and 
      reveal that these aggregates sequester key macroautophagy/autophagy receptors, 
      SQSTM1/p62 and TOLLIP. This sequestration disrupts MAP1LC3/LC3 recruitment and 
      impairs autophagosome formation, thereby compromising the autophagic pathway. 
      Importantly, we show that HSPB1 facilitates the dissociation of these receptors 
      from poly-G aggregates and consequently restores autophagic function. 
      Overexpressing HSPB1 alleviates poly-G-induced neurodegeneration in mouse models. 
      Taken together, these findings highlight a mechanistic basis for the 
      neuroprotective effects of HSPB1 and suggest its potential as a therapeutic 
      target in treating poly-G-associated neurodegenerative diseases.Abbreviations:

TI  - dmTGS: Precise Targeted Enrichment Long-Read Sequencing Panel for Tandem Repeat 
      Detection.
PG  - 319-331
LID - 10.1093/clinchem/hvae164 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tandem repeats (TRs) are abundant in the human genome and associated 
      with repeat expansion disorders. Our study aimed to develop a tandem repeat panel 
      utilizing targeted long-read sequencing to evaluate known TRs associated with 
      these disorders and assess its clinical utility. METHODS: We developed a targeted 
      long-read sequencing panel for 70 TR loci, termed dynamic mutation 
      third-generation sequencing (dmTGS), using the PacBio Sequel II platform. We 
      tested 108 samples with suspected repeat expansion disorders and compared the 
      results with conventional molecular methods. RESULTS: For 108 samples, dmTGS 
      achieved an average of 8000 high-fidelity reads per sample, with a mean read 
      length of 4.7 kb and read quality of 99.9%. dmTGS outperformed repeat-primed-PCR 
      and fluorescence amplicon length analysis-PCR in distinguishing expanded from 
      normal alleles and accurately quantifying repeat counts. The method demonstrated 
      high concordance with confirmatory methods (rlinear = 0.991, P < 0.01), and 
      detected mosaicism with sensitivities of 1% for FMR1 CGG premutation and 5% for 
      full mutations. dmTGS successfully identified interruptive motifs in genes that 
      conventional methods had missed. For variable number TRs in the PLIN4 gene, dmTGS 
      identified precise repeat counts and sequence motifs. Screening 57 patients with 
      suspected genetic muscular diseases, dmTGS confirmed repeat expansions in genes 
      such as GIPC1, NOTCH2NLC, NUTM2B-AS1/LOC642361, and DMPK. Additionally, dmTGS 
      detected CCG interruptions in CTG repeats in 8 myotonic dystrophy type 1 patients 
      with detailed characterization. CONCLUSIONS: dmTGS accurately detects repeat 
      sizes and interruption motifs associated with repeat expansion disorders and 
      demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional molecular methods.

AB  - A heterozygous CGG repeat expansion in 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of GIPC1 
      is one of the causative factors of oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM), an 
      adult-onset hereditary muscle disease characterized by progressive ptosis, 
      ophthalmoplegia, and facial, bulbar, and distal limb muscle weakness. CGG repeat 
      expansion in GIPC1 has also been reported to be associated with Parkinson's 
      disease, but these patients did not exhibit myopathic symptoms. We experienced 
      two unrelated cases of oculopharyngeal type myopathy with CGG repeat expansion in 
      GIPC1 presenting parkinsonism after exhibiting myopathic symptoms. Both cases 
      showed p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in the skin, similar to those in 
      NOTCH2NLC-related disorders. Our cases suggest that GIPC1-related repeat 
      expansions may be associated with a broad spectrum and tissue-differential 
      neuromuscular manifestations, indicating a common mechanism between OPDM2 and 
      other CGG-repeat expansion diseases. It is important to note OPDM2 patients' 
      central neurological symptoms, as myopathic symptoms may obscure central nervous 
      system manifestations.

      causes, as determined through comprehensive prescreening analyses, were selected 
      for the study. Screening for CGG non-coding repeat expansions in LRP12, GIPC1 and 
      RILPL1 genes was conducted using PCR and long-read sequencing technologies. 
      RESULTS: We identified CGG repeat expansions in LRP12 from 44 cases, establishing 
      it as the fourth most common aetiology in Japanese IPN. Most cases (29/37) 
      exhibited distal limb weakness, without ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, facial muscle 
      weakness or bulbar palsy. Neurogenic changes were frequently observed in both 
      needle electromyography (97%) and skeletal muscle tissue (100%). In nerve 
      conduction studies, 28 cases primarily showed impairment in motor nerves without 
      concurrent involvement of sensory nerves, consistent with the phenotype of 
      hereditary motor neuropathy. In seven cases, both motor and sensory nerves were 
      affected, resembling the Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) phenotype. Importantly, the 
      mean CGG repeat number detected in the present patients was significantly shorter 
      than that of patients with LRP12-oculopharyngodistal myopathy (p<0.0001). 
      Additionally, GIPC1 and RILPL1 repeat expansions were absent in our IPN cases. 
      CONCLUSION: We initially elucidate LRP12 repeat expansions as a prevalent cause 
      of CMT, highlighting the necessity for an adapted screening strategy in clinical 
      practice, particularly when addressing patients with IPN.

AB  - Tandem nucleotide repeat (TNR) expansions, particularly the CNG nucleotide 
      configuration, are associated with a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. In 
      this study, we aimed to identify novel unstable CNG repeat loci associated with 
      the neurogenetic disorder spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). Using a computational 
      approach, 15,069 CNG repeat loci in the coding and noncoding regions of the human 
      genome were identified. Based on the feature selection criteria (repeat length 
      >10 and functional location of repeats), we selected 52 repeats for further 
      analysis and evaluated the repeat length variability in 100 control subjects. A 
      subset of 19 CNG loci observed to be highly variable in control subjects was 
      selected for subsequent analysis in 100 individuals with SCA. The genes with 
      these highly variable repeats also exhibited higher gene expression levels in the 
      brain according to the tissue expression dataset (GTEx). No pathogenic expansion 
      events were identified in patient samples, which is a limitation given the size 
      of the patient group examined; however, these loci contain potential risk alleles 
      for expandability. Recent studies have implicated GLS, RAI1, GIPC1, MED15, EP400, 
      MEF2A, and CNKSR2 in neurological diseases, with GLS, GIPC1, MED15, RAI1, and 
      MEF2A sharing the same repeat loci reported in this study. This finding validates 
      the approach of evaluating repeat loci in different populations and their 
      possible implications for human pathologies.

TI  - Non-coding CGG repeat expansion in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 is associated with a 
      phenotype of oculopharyngodistal myopathy.
PG  - 340-346
LID - 10.1136/jmg-2023-109345 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is a rare adult-onset 
      neuromuscular disease, associated with CGG repeat expansions in the 5' 
      untranslated region of LRP12, GIPC1, NOTCH2NLC and RILPL1. However, the genetic 
      cause of a proportion of pathoclinically confirmed cases remains unknown. 
      METHODS: A total of 26 OPDM patients with unknown genetic cause(s) from 4 
      tertiary referral hospitals were included in this study. Clinical data and 
      laboratory findings were collected. Muscle samples were observed by histological 
      and immunofluorescent staining. Long-read sequencing was initially conducted in 
      six patients with OPDM. Repeat-primed PCR was used to screen the CGG repeat 
      expansions in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 in all 26 patients. RESULTS: We identified CGG 
      repeat expansion in the non-coding transcripts of LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 in another 
      two unrelated Chinese cases with typical pathoclinical features of OPDM. The 
      repeat expansion was more than 70 times in the patients but less than 40 times in 
      the normal controls. Both patients showed no leucoencephalopathy but one showed 
      mild cognitive impairment detected by Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Rimmed 
      vacuoles and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions (INIs) were identified in 
      muscle pathology, and colocalisation of CGG RNA foci with p62 was also found in 
      the INIs of patient-derived fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: We identified another two 
      unrelated cases with CGG repeat expansion in the long non-coding RNA of the 
      LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 gene, presenting with a phenotype of OPDM. Our cases 
      broadened the recognised phenotypic spectrum and pathogenesis in the disease 
      associated with CGG repeat expansion in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1.

AB  - Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is a rare adult-onset neuromuscular disease 
      characterized by ocular, facial, bulbar and distal limb muscle weakness. Here, we 
      presented a pair of siblings with OPDM2 displaying marked intrafamilial 
      phenotypic heterogeneity. In addition to muscle weakness, the proband also 
      demonstrated tremor and visual disturbance that have not been reported previously 
      in OPDM2. Electrophysiological and pathological studies further suggested the 
      presence of neurogenic impairment in the proband. Repeat-primed polymerase chain 
      reaction (RP-PCR) and fluorescence amplicon length analysis polymerase chain 
      reaction (AL-PCR) confirmed the molecular diagnosis of OPDM2 in the siblings. 
      Given the rarity of the case, the association between OPDM2 and tremor, visual 
      disturbance, or neurogenic impairment remained to be explored.

AB  - Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is a late-onset degenerative muscle disorder 
      characterized by ptosis and weakening of the facial, pharyngeal, and distal limb 
      muscles. Our study reprogrammed human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from 
      the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a patient with a CGG repeat 
      expansion in the 5'UTR of GIPC1 gene that co-segregated with the disease. The 
      generated iPSCs express the pluripotent cell markers with no mycoplasma 
      contamination. Besides, it showed normal karyotypes and the capacity to 
      differentiate into three germ layers. We also identified that it had the same 
      specific mutation as the patient did.

TI  - GGC Repeat Expansion of RILPL1 is Associated with Oculopharyngodistal Myopathy.
PG  - 512-526
LID - 10.1002/ana.26436 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an adult-onset neuromuscular 
      disease characterized by progressive ptosis, dysarthria, ophthalmoplegia, and 
      distal muscle weakness. Recent studies revealed that GGC repeat expansions in 
      5'-UTR of LRP12, GIPC1, and NOTCH2NLC are associated with OPDM. Despite these 
      advances, approximately 30% of OPDM patients remain genetically undiagnosed. 
      Herein, we aim to investigate the genetic basis for undiagnosed OPDM patients in 
      two unrelated Chinese Han families. METHODS: Parametric linkage analysis was 
      performed. Long-read sequencing followed by repeat-primed polymerase chain 
      reaction and amplicon length polymerase chain reaction were used to determine the 
      genetic cause. Targeted methylation sequencing was implemented to detect 
      epigenetic changes. The possible pathogenesis mechanism was investigated by 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, RNA fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization, and immunofluorescence staining of muscle biopsy samples. RESULTS: 
      The disease locus was mapped to 12q24.3. Subsequently, GGC repeat expansion in 
      the promoter region of RILPL1 was identified in six OPDM patients from two 
      families, findings consistent with a founder effect, designated as OPDM type 4. 
      Targeted methylation sequencing revealed hypermethylation at the RILPL1 locus in 
      unaffected individuals with ultralong expansion. Analysis of muscle samples 
      showed no significant differences in RILPL1 mRNA or RILPL1 protein levels between 
      patients and controls. Public CAGE-seq data indicated that alternative 
      transcription start sites exist upstream of the RefSeq-annotated RILPL1 
      transcription start site. Strand-specific RNA-seq data revealed bidirectional 
      transcription from the RILPL1 locus. Finally, fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization/immunofluorescence staining showed that both sense and antisense 
      transcripts formed RNA foci, and were co-localized with hnRNPA2B1 and p62 in the 
      intranuclear inclusions of OPDM type 4 patients. INTERPRETATION: Our findings 
      implicate abnormal GGC repeat expansions in the promoter region of RILPL1 as a 
      novel genetic cause for OPDM, and suggest a methylation mechanism and a potential 
      RNA toxicity mechanism are involved in OPDM type 4 pathogenesis. ANN NEUROL

AB  - Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is a rare adult-onset hereditary muscular 
      disease characterized by slowly progressive ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia and 
      weakness of the facial, pharyngeal and distal limb muscles. Recently, CGG repeat 
      expansion mutations in three genes, LRP12, GIPC1 and NOTCH2NLC, have been 
      identified as causative factors for OPDM. Here, we report clinicopathologically 
      typical familial OPDM patients from southwestern China. CGG repeat expansions in 
      GIPC1 were detected in two OPDM-affected individuals. Our study was the first 
      GIPC1-OPDM report from southwestern China, further confirming expanded GGC 
      repeats in GIPC1 as the cause of OPDM.

TI  - GIPC1 CGG Repeat Expansion Is Associated with Movement Disorders.
PG  - 704-715

AB  - OBJECTIVE: CGG/GGC repeat expansion in FMR1 and NOTCH2NLC is reportedly 
      associated with movement disorders; therefore, we hypothesized that the CGG 
      repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1, which was previously identified 
      in myopathy, might also be associated with movement-disorder phenotypes. Here, we 
      investigated whether CGG repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1 
      presents in a cohort of patients with movement disorders. METHODS: We screened 
      for the CGG repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1 in 1,346 
      movement-disorder patients and 1,451 matched healthy controls. RESULTS: No 
      patients or controls harbored expanded CGG repeats in LRP12 or NUTM2B-AS1, 
      whereas 16 patients harbored >40 CGG repeats in GIPC1, with 11 of these patients 
      harboring >60 CGG repeats. One control individual harbored an expanded GIPC1 
      allele (83 CGG units), suggesting that approximately 1% of patients affected by 
      movement disorders in our population might harbor GIPC1 CGG repeat expansion, 
      with this likely extremely rare in healthy controls (<0.001). The clinical 
      phenotypes of the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive patients strongly resembled those in 
      patients displaying NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat-positive movement disorders. 
      Additionally, the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive patients presented white-matter 
      hyperintensities but without typical NOTCH2NLC-related high-intensity signals in 
      the corticomedullary junction. Furthermore, 44% of the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive 
      patients showed a cognitive deficit, and skin biopsies in 2 patients revealed 
      deposition of intranuclear inclusions. INTERPRETATION: The CGG repeat expansion 
      in GIPC1 might be associated with movement-disorder phenotypes and lead to 
      diseases related to intranuclear inclusions. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:704-715.

AB  - Recent studies indicate that CGG repeat expansions in LRP12, GIPC1, and NOTCH2NLC 
      are associated with oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) types 1, 2, and 3, 
      respectively. However, some clinicopathologically confirmed OPDM cases continue 
      to have unknown genetic causes. Here, through a combination of long-read 
      whole-genome sequencing (LRS), repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR), 
      and fluorescence amplicon length analysis PCR (AL-PCR), we found that a CGG 
      repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of RILPL1 is associated with familial and simplex 
      OPDM type 4 (OPDM4). The number of repeats ranged from 139 to 197. Methylation 
      analysis indicates that the methylation levels in RILPL1 were unaltered in OPDM4 
      individuals. Analyses of muscle biopsies suggested that the expanded CGG repeat 
      might be translated into a toxic poly-glycine protein that co-localizes with p62 
      in intranuclear inclusions. Moreover, analyses suggest that the toxic RNA 
      gain-of-function effects also contributed to the pathogenesis of this disease. 
      Intriguingly, all four types of OPDM have been found to be associated with the 
      CGG repeat expansions located in 5' UTRs. This finding suggests that a common 
      pathogenic mechanism, driven by the CGG repeat expansion, might underlie all 
      cases of OPDM.

TI  - Intranuclear inclusions in skin biopsies are not limited to neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusion disease but can also be seen in oculopharyngodistal myopathy.
PG  - e12787

AB  - AIMS: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is caused by the expansion of CGG 
      repeats in NOTCH2NLC (OPDM_NOTCH2NLC) GIPC1 (OPDM_GIPC1), or LRP12 (OPDM_LRP12). 
      Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is clinically distinct from OPDM 
      but is also caused by the expansion of CGG repeats in NOTCH2NLC, which may be an 
      indicator of intranuclear inclusion in skin biopsy. We investigated the presence 
      of intranuclear inclusions in skin biopsies from patients with OPDM and muscle 
      diseases with a similar pathology to evaluate whether they will have similar 
      diagnostic findings on skin biopsy. METHODS: We analysed the frequency of 
      p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in sweat gland cells, adipocytes and 
      fibroblasts in skin biopsy samples from patients with OPDM (OPDM_NOTCH2NLC 
      [n = 2], OPDM_GIPC1 [n = 6] and OPDM_LRP12 [n = 3]), NIID (n = 1), OPMD (n = 1), 
      IBM (n = 4) and GNE myopathy (n = 2). RESULTS: The p62-postive intranuclear 
      inclusions were observed in all three cell types in both patients with 
      OPDM_NOTCH2NLC and a patient with NIID, in at least one cell type in all six 
      patients with OPDM_GIPC1, and all in three cell types in one of the three 
      patients with OPDM_LRP12. These findings were not observed in patients with OPMD, 
      IBM or GNE myopathy. CONCLUSION: Intranuclear inclusions in skin biopsy samples 
      are not specific to NIID and are found in all three types of genetically 
      confirmed OPDM, suggesting that the underlying mechanism of OPDM may be similar 
      to NIID, regardless of causative genes.

TI  - The GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC is associated with oculopharyngodistal 
      myopathy type 3.
PG  - 1819-1832
LID - 10.1093/brain/awab077 [doi]
AB  - Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an adult-onset neuromuscular disease 
      characterized by progressive ocular, facial, pharyngeal and distal limb muscle 
      involvement. Trinucleotide repeat expansions in LRP12 or GIPC1 were recently 
      reported to be associated with OPDM. However, a significant portion of OPDM 
      patients have unknown genetic causes. In this study, long-read whole-genome 
      sequencing and repeat-primed PCR were performed and we identified GGC repeat 
      expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene in 16.7% (4/24) of a cohort of Chinese OPDM 
      patients, designated as OPDM type 3 (OPDM3). Methylation analysis indicated that 
      methylation levels of the NOTCH2NLC gene were unaltered in OPDM3 patients, but 
      increased significantly in asymptomatic carriers. Quantitative real-time PCR 
      analysis indicated that NOTCH2NLC mRNA levels were increased in muscle but not in 
      blood of OPDM3 patients. Immunofluorescence on OPDM muscle samples and expressing 
      mutant NOTCH2NLC with (GGC)69 repeat expansions in HEK293 cells indicated that 
      mutant NOTCH2NLC-polyglycine protein might be a major component of intranuclear 
      inclusions, and contribute to toxicity in cultured cells. In addition, two 
      RNA-binding proteins, hnRNP A/B and MBNL1, were both co-localized with p62 in 
      intranuclear inclusions in OPDM muscle samples. These results indicated that a 
      toxic protein gain-of-function mechanism and RNA gain-of-function mechanism may 
      both play a vital role in the pathogenic processes of OPDM3. This study extended 
      the spectrum of NOTCH2NLC repeat expansion-related diseases to a predominant 
      myopathy phenotype presenting as OPDM, and provided evidence for possible 
      pathogenesis of these diseases.

TI  - 5' UTR CGG repeat expansion in GIPC1 is associated with oculopharyngodistal 
      myopathy.
PG  - 601-614
LID - 10.1093/brain/awaa426 [doi]
AB  - Oculopharyngodistal myopathy is a late-onset degenerative muscle disorder 
      characterized by ptosis and weakness of the facial, pharyngeal, and distal limb 
      muscles. A recent report suggested a non-coding trinucleotide repeat expansion in 
      LRP12 to be associated with the disease. Here we report a genetic study in a 
      Chinese cohort of 41 patients with the clinical diagnosis of oculopharyngodistal 
      myopathy (21 cases from seven families and 20 sporadic cases). In a large family 
      with 12 affected individuals, combined haplotype and linkage analysis revealed a 
      maximum two-point logarithm of the odds (LOD) score of 3.3 in chromosomal region 
      chr19p13.11-p13.2 and narrowed the candidate region to an interval of 4.5 Mb. 
      Using a comprehensive strategy combining whole-exome sequencing, long-read 
      sequencing, repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction and GC-rich polymerase chain 
      reaction, we identified an abnormal CGG repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of the 
      GIPC1 gene that co-segregated with disease. Overall, the repeat expansion in 
      GIPC1 was identified in 51.9% independent pedigrees (4/7 families and 10/20 
      sporadic cases), while the repeat expansion in LRP12 was only identified in one 
      sporadic case (3.7%) in our cohort. The number of CGG repeats was <30 in controls 
      but >60 in affected individuals. There was a slight correlation between repeat 
      size and the age at onset. Both repeat expansion and retraction were observed 
      during transmission but somatic instability was not evident. These results 
      further support that non-coding CGG repeat expansion plays an essential role in 
      the pathogenesis of oculopharyngodistal myopathy.

AB  - Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is a rare hereditary muscle disease 
      characterized by progressive distal limb weakness, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, 
      bulbar muscle weakness and rimmed vacuoles on muscle biopsy. Recently, CGG repeat 
      expansions in the noncoding regions of two genes, LRP12 and GIPC1, have been 
      reported to be causative for OPDM. Furthermore, neuronal intranuclear inclusion 
      disease (NIID) has been recently reported to be caused by CGG repeat expansions 
      in NOTCH2NLC. We aimed to identify and to clinicopathologically characterize 
      patients with OPDM who have CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC (OPDM_NOTCH2NLC). 
      Note that 211 patients from 201 families, who were clinically or 
      clinicopathologically diagnosed with OPDM or oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, 
      were screened for CGG expansions in NOTCH2NLC by repeat primed-PCR. Clinical 
      information and muscle pathology slides of identified patients with 
      OPDM_NOTCH2NLC were re-reviewed. Intra-myonuclear inclusions were evaluated using 
      immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy (EM). Seven Japanese OPDM patients 
      had CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC. All seven patients clinically 
      demonstrated ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, dysarthria and muscle weakness; they 
      myopathologically had intra-myonuclear inclusions stained with 
      anti-poly-ubiquitinated proteins, anti-SUMO1 and anti-p62 antibodies, which were 
      diagnostic of NIID (typically on skin biopsy), in addition to rimmed vacuoles. 
      The sample for EM was available only from one patient, which demonstrated 
      intranuclear inclusions of 12.6 +/- 1.6 nm in diameter. We identified seven 
      patients with OPDM_NOTCH2NLC. Our patients had various additional central and/or 
      peripheral nervous system involvement, although all were clinicopathologically 
      compatible; thus, they were diagnosed as having OPDM and expanding a phenotype of 
      the neuromyodegenerative disease caused by CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC.

AB  - Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an adult-onset inherited neuromuscular 
      disorder characterized by progressive ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, and 
      weakness of the masseter, facial, pharyngeal, and distal limb muscles. The 
      myopathological features are presence of rimmed vacuoles (RVs) in the muscle 
      fibers and myopathic changes of differing severity. Inheritance is variable, with 
      either putative autosomal-dominant or autosomal-recessive pattern. Here, using a 
      comprehensive strategy combining whole-genome sequencing (WGS), long-read 
      whole-genome sequencing (LRS), linkage analysis, repeat-primed polymerase chain 
      reaction (RP-PCR), and fluorescence amplicon length analysis polymerase chain 
      reaction (AL-PCR), we identified an abnormal GGC repeat expansion in the 5' UTR 
      of GIPC1 in one out of four families and three sporadic case subjects from a 
      Chinese OPDM cohort. Expanded GGC repeats were further confirmed as the cause of 
      OPDM in an additional 2 out of 4 families and 6 out of 13 sporadic Chinese 
      individuals with OPDM, as well as 7 out of 194 unrelated Japanese individuals 
      with OPDM. Methylation, qRT-PCR, and western blot analysis indicated that GIPC1 
      mRNA levels were increased while protein levels were unaltered in OPDM-affected 
      individuals. RNA sequencing indicated p53 signaling, vascular smooth muscle 
      contraction, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and ribosome pathways were involved 
      in the pathogenic mechanisms of OPDM-affected individuals with GGC repeat 
      expansion in GIPC1. This study provides further evidence that OPDM is associated 
      with GGC repeat expansions in distinct genes and highly suggests that expanded 
      GGC repeat units are essential in the pathogenesis of OPDM, regardless of the 
      genes in which the expanded repeats are located.

AB  - The implementation of nationwide pneumococcal vaccination may lead to alterations 
      in the pneumococcal population due to selective pressure induced by the vaccine. 
      To monitor such changes, pneumococcal isolates causing invasive pneumococcal 
      disease (IPD) before (2004-2005, n=1154) and after (2008-2009, n=1190) the 
      implementation of the 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7) in 2006 in the 
      national immunization program (NIP) of The Netherlands were characterized by 
      molecular typing using multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis 
      (MLVA) and capsular sequence typing (CST). The IPD incidence after the 
      implementation of PCV7 in children <5 years of age declined, mainly due to an 
      impressive reduction of cases caused by vaccine serotypes. In the age group of 
      patients >/=5 years of age, the overall IPD incidence remained constant, but the 
      IPD incidence due to vaccine serotypes declined in this age cohort as well, 
      indicating herd immunity. IPD incidence of non-vaccine serotypes 1 and 22F 
      isolates increased significantly and a shift in genetic background of the 
      isolates belonging to these serotypes was observed. In general the composition of 
      the pneumococcal population remained similar after the introduction of PCV7. Both 
      before and after introduction of the vaccine several possible capsular switch 
      events were noticed. We found 4 isolates from the pre-vaccination period in which 
      the serotype 19F capsular locus had been horizontally transferred to a different 
      genetic background. Remarkably, none of the 5 post-vaccination isolates in which 
      we observed possible capsule switch belonged to the 19F serotype, possibly due to 
      vaccine induced pressure. In the post-vaccine implementation period we found no 
      evidence for capsular switch of a vaccine serotype to a non-vaccine serotype, 
      indicating that capsular switch is not the main driving force for replacement. 
      This study provides insights into the effects of nationwide vaccination on the 
      pneumococcal population causing IPD.
