AB  - OBJECTIVE: Late-onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA) is a slowly progressive cerebellar 
      disorder with symptom onset >/=30years of age. Intronic tandem repeat expansions 
      (TREs) in RFC1 and FGF14 have recently emerged as common causes of LOCA. The 
      relative contribution of classic vs. newly discovered TREs has not been 
      systematically investigated in LOCA cohorts. METHODS: Over 28 years, 206 
      consecutive Greek LOCA index patients were referred for genetic testing and, 
      based on clinical data and inheritance pattern, screened for FRDA, SCA1,2,3,6,7, 
      FXTAS, CANVAS and SCA27B. RESULTS: A genetic diagnosis was reached in 62 of 206 
      cases (30.1 %). Mean age was 60.1 +/- 11.2 (35-87) years and mean age at onset 
      (AAO) 52.5 +/- 11.4 (30-80) years. SCA27B accounted for 9.7 % of LOCA cases, CANVAS 
      for 7.8 % and FRDA for 4.4 %. The overall frequency of SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 was 
      6.8 %. No cases of SCA3 and SCA6 were identified. FXTAS contributed 1.5 % of 
      cases. In sporadic cases, the diagnostic yield was 22.8 % (34 of 149; SCA27B: 
      8.7 %, CANVAS: 8.1 %, FRDA: 2.7 %, SCA2: 1.3 %, FXTAS: 1.3 % and SCA7: 0.7 %). In 
      familial cases, the diagnostic yield was 49.1 % (28 of 57). Two cases with CANVAS 
      had pseudodominant inheritance. Patients with SCA27B, CANVAS and FXTAS had mean 
      AAO > 50 years, whereas patients with FRDA, SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 had mean 
      AAO < 50 years. CONCLUSION: Recently-discovered TREs causing SCA27B and CANVAS 
      represent the commonest known genetic causes of LOCA. Prioritizing testing for 
      FGF14 and RFC1 expansions in the diagnostic algorithm of LOCA is recommended.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Defects in the ataxin-2 (ATXN-2) protein and CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in its coding gene, Atxn-2, cause the neurodegenerative disorder 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). While clinical studies suggest potential 
      benefits of human-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) for treating various 
      ataxias, the exact mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects and 
      interaction with host tissue to stimulate neurotrophin expression remain unclear 
      specifically in the context of SCA2. METHODS: Human bone marrow-derived MSCs 
      (hMSCs) were injected into the cisterna magna of 26-week-old wild-type and SCA2 
      mice. Mice were assessed for impaired motor coordination using the accelerating 
      rotarod, open field test, and composite phenotype scoring. At 50 weeks, the 
      cerebellum vermis was harvested for protein assessment and immunohistochemical 
      analysis. RESULTS: Significant loss of NeuN and calbindin was observed in 
      25-week-old SCA2 mice. However, after receiving multiple injections of hMSCs 
      starting at 26 weeks of age, these mice exhibited a significant improvement in 
      abnormal motor performance and a protective effect on Purkinje cells. This 
      beneficial effect persisted until the mice reached 50 weeks of age, at which 
      point they were sacrificed to study further mechanistic events triggered by the 
      administration of hMSCs. Calbindin-positive cells in the Purkinje cell layer 
      expressed bone-derived neurotrophic factor after hMSC administration, 
      contributing to the protection of cerebellar neurons from cell death. CONCLUSION: 
      In conclusion, repeated administration of hMSCs shows promise in alleviating SCA2 
      symptoms by preserving Purkinje cells, improving neurotrophic support, and 
      reducing inflammation, ultimately leading to the preservation of locomotor 
      function in SCA2 mice.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe a case of spinocerebellar ataxia presenting with 
      progressive apraxia of speech (AOS). METHODS: A 54-year-old man with progressive 
      speech changes was seen clinically and referred to our observational research 
      program on degenerative speech and language disorders. He underwent detailed 
      speech-language and neurologic assessments and multimodal neuroimaging studies. 
      Three board-certified speech-language pathologists, blinded to other study data, 
      reached a consensus speech diagnosis. RESULTS: The patient reported 2 years of 
      progressive speech changes against a background of mild imbalance. Speech 
      alternating and sequential motion rates were regular but moderately slow. He 
      segmented syllables, most prominently during repetition of multisyllabic words, 
      and had decreased prosodic variation in connected speech. He was diagnosed with 
      prosodic-predominant primary progressive AOS. He had mild extremity ataxia and 
      difficulty with tandem gait on neurologic examination. MRI showed marked 
      pontine-cerebellar atrophy. FDG-PET showed premotor area and posterior fossa 
      hypometabolism. Genetic testing revealed cytosine-adenine-guanine repeat 
      expansion in the ATXN2 gene, consistent with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      (SCA2). DISCUSSION: SCA2 is an autosomal dominant, degenerative disease 
      characterized by cerebellar ataxia, including ataxic dysarthria. Our case 
      demonstrates that SCA2 can manifest with progressive AOS. Neuroimaging supported 
      involvement of areas classically associated with AOS.

TI  - Fluctuations in Medium Viscosity May Affect the Stability of the CAG Tract in the 
      ATXN2 Gene.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines12102396 [doi]
LID - 2396
AB  - Background: Trinucleotide repeats are the cause of many neurodegenerative 
      diseases that are currently incurable. In this regard, the question of the causes 
      of occurrence and methods of prevention or treatment of diseases caused by the 
      expansion of repeats in the CAG tract of the ATXN2 gene remains relevant. 
      Previously, it was shown that the frequency of occurrence of additional OS (open 
      states) zones increases with increasing length of the CAG tract, and the value 
      inverse to the frequency correlates with the age of disease onset. Methods: In 
      this work, the influence of the viscosity of the medium and the external torque 
      on the stability of the CAG tract in the ATXN2 gene was studied using 
      mathematical modeling methods. Results: It has been established that the 
      probability of the appearance of additional OS zones of significant size 
      increases with an increase in the CAG of the tract (k > 40 CAG repeats) for all 
      viscosity values, however, at k </= 40, the change in viscosity does not 
      significantly affect the probability of additional OS zones in the tract. 
      Conclusions: It was found that under normal conditions (absence of pathology), 
      viscosity does not have a reliable effect on the stability of the DNA molecule, 
      but when pathology appears, an increase in viscosity contributes to an increase 
      in DNA stability, and, accordingly, a decrease has a negative effect on the 
      stabilization of the DNA molecule. In the zone of close to incomplete penetrance 
      of the disease, viscosity does not have a reliable effect on the stability of the 
      CAG tract.

AB  - The Parkinson's Families Project is a UK-wide study aimed at identifying genetic 
      variation associated with familial and early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). We 
      recruited individuals with a clinical diagnosis of PD and age at motor symptom 
      onset </=45 years and/or a family history of PD in up to third-degree relatives. 
      Where possible, we also recruited affected and unaffected relatives. We analysed 
      DNA samples with a combination of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array 
      genotyping, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and 
      whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We investigated the association between identified 
      pathogenic mutations and demographic and clinical factors such as age at motor 
      symptom onset, family history, motor symptoms (MDS-UPDRS) and cognitive 
      performance (MoCA). We performed baseline genetic analysis in 718 families, of 
      which 205 had sporadic early-onset PD (sEOPD), 113 had familial early-onset PD 
      (fEOPD), and 400 had late-onset familial PD (fLOPD). 69 (9.6%) of these families 
      carried pathogenic variants in known monogenic PD-related genes. The rate of a 
      molecular diagnosis increased to 28.1% in PD with motor onset </=35 years. We 
      identified pathogenic variants in LRRK2 in 4.2% of families, and biallelic 
      pathogenic variants in PRKN in 3.6% of families. We also identified two families 
      with SNCA duplications and three families with a pathogenic repeat expansion in 
      ATXN2, as well as single families with pathogenic variants in VCP, PINK1, PNPLA6, 
      PLA2G6, SPG7, GCH1, and RAB32. An additional 73 (10.2%) families were carriers of 
      at least one pathogenic or risk GBA1 variant. Most early-onset and familial PD 
      cases do not have a known genetic cause, indicating that there are likely to be 
      further monogenic causes for PD.

TI  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia in Brazil: A Comprehensive Genotype - Phenotype Analysis.
PG  - 2414-2425
LID - 10.1007/s12311-024-01745-3 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a diverse group of hereditary 
      neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of the 
      cerebellum and other parts of the nervous system. In this study, we examined the 
      genotype...phenotype correlations in SCAs within the Brazilian population by 
      leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 763 individuals from SARAH Network of 
      Rehabilitation Hospitals. Using a retrospective, cross-sectional, observational, 
      multicentric approach, we analysed medical records and conducted standardized 
      molecular testing to explore epidemiological characteristics, clinical 
      manifestations, and genetic profiles of SCAs in Brazil. Our findings revealed the 
      predominance of SCA3, followed by SCA7 and SCA2, which aligns with global trends 
      and reflects the specific genetic landscape of Brazil. A significant inverse 
      relationship between the age of symptom onset and CAG repeat length in the 
      mutated allele was observed across SCAs 2, 3, and 7. This study also highlights a 
      trend towards paternal inheritance in SCA2 and details the distribution of CAG 
      repeat expansions, which correlates larger expansions with earlier onset and 
      specific symptomatology. This extensive analysis underscores the critical 
      importance of genetic testing in the diagnosis and management of SCAs and 
      enlightens the intricate genotype...phenotype interplay within a genetically 
      diverse population. Despite certain limitations, such as potential selection bias 
      and the retrospective nature of the study, our research provides invaluable 
      insights into the prevalence, genetic underpinnings, and clinical variability of 
      SCAs in Brazil. We suggest a broader demographic scope and investigations into 
      nonmotor symptoms in future studies to obtain a more comprehensive understanding 
      of SCAs.

COIS- Declarations. Human Ethics and Consent to Participate: Not applicable. 
      Considering that this retrospective study was conducted only from data collected 
      from medical records and anonymized, which included individuals followed up in 
      units of the SARAH Network of Rehabilitation Hospitals located outside the state 
      of Rio de Janeiro, obtaining consent to participate in the Declaration was 
      waived. In addition, many patients had already died or interrupted the clinical 
      follow-up, and the COVID-19 pandemic transformed many consultations into 
      teleconsultations, which made it difficult to obtain consent to comply with the 
      Declaration of Helsinki if desired. Competing Interests: The authors declare no 
      competing interests.

AB  - Intermediate-length repeat expansions in ATAXIN-2 (ATXN2) are the strongest 
      genetic risk factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). At the molecular 
      level, ATXN2 intermediate expansions enhance TDP-43 toxicity and pathology. 
      However, whether this triggers ALS pathogenesis at the cellular and functional 
      level remains unknown. Here, we combine patient-derived and mouse models to 
      dissect the effects of ATXN2 intermediate expansions in an ALS background. 
      iPSC-derived motor neurons from ATXN2-ALS patients show altered stress granules, 
      neurite damage and abnormal electrophysiological properties compared to healthy 
      control and other familial ALS mutations. In TDP-43(Tg)-ALS mice, ATXN2-Q33 
      causes reduced motor function, NMJ alterations, neuron degeneration and altered 
      in vitro stress granule dynamics. Furthermore, gene expression changes related to 
      mitochondrial function and inflammatory response are detected and confirmed at 
      the cellular level in mice and human neuron and organoid models. Together, these 
      results define pathogenic defects underlying ATXN2-ALS and provide a framework 
      for future research into ATXN2-dependent pathogenesis and therapy.

TI  - Stability of the CAG Tract in the ATXN2 Gene Depends on the Localization of CAA 
      Interruptions.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines12081648 [doi]
LID - 1648
AB  - It is known that the presence of CAA codons in the CAG tract affects the nature 
      and time of disease onset caused by the expansion of trinucleotide repeats. The 
      mechanisms leading to the occurrence of these diseases should be sought not only 
      at the level of the physiological role of the ATXN2 protein, but also at the DNA 
      level. These mechanisms are associated with non-canonical configurations 
      (hairpins) that can form in the CAG tract. The tendency of hairpins to slide 
      along the corresponding threads is usually considered important to explain the 
      expansion of the CAG tract. At the same time, hairpins occur in areas of open 
      states. Previous studies on the role of CAA interruptions have suggested that, 
      under certain conditions, they can stabilize the dynamics of the hairpin, 
      preventing the expansion of the CAG tract. We calculated the probability of 
      additional open state zones occurrence in the CAG tract using an angular 
      mathematical model of DNA. The calculations made it possible to establish that 
      CAA interruptions affect the stability of the CAG tract, and this influence, 
      depending on the localization of the interruption, can both increase and decrease 
      the stability of the CAG tract.

TI  - Spinocerebellar Ataxias: Phenotypic Spectrum of PolyQ versus Non-Repeat Expansion 
      Forms.
PG  - 2258-2268
LID - 10.1007/s12311-024-01723-9 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are most frequently due to (CAG)(n) (coding for 
      polyglutamine, polyQ) expansions and, less so, to expansion of other 
      oligonucleotide repeats (non-polyQ) or other type of variants (non-repeat 
      expansion SCA). In this study we compared polyQ and non-repeat expansion SCA, in 
      a cohort of patients with hereditary ataxia followed at a tertiary hospital. From 
      a prospective study, 88 patients (51 families) with SCA were selected, 74 (40 
      families) of whom genetically diagnosed. Thirty-eight patients (51.4%, 19 
      families) were confirmed as having a polyQ (no other repeat-expansions were 
      identified) and 36 (48.6%, 21 families) a non-repeat expansion SCA. Median 
      age-at-onset was 39.5 [30.0-45.5] for polyQ and 7.0 years [1.00-21.50] for 
      non-repeat expansion SCA. PolyQ SCA were associated with cerebellar onset, and 
      non-repeat expansion forms with non-cerebellar onset. Time to diagnosis was 
      longer for non-repeat expansion SCA. The most common polyQ SCA were 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD/SCA3) (73.7%) and SCA2 (15.8%); whereas in non-repeat 
      expansion SCA ATX-CACNA1A (14.3%), ATP1A3-related ataxia, ATX-ITPR1, 
      ATX/HSP-KCNA2, and ATX-PRKCG (9.5% each) predominated. Disease duration (up to 
      inclusion) was significantly higher in non-repeat expansion SCA, but the 
      difference in SARA score was not statistically significant. Cerebellar peduncles 
      and pons atrophy were more common in polyQ ataxias, as was axonal neuropathy. SCA 
      had a wide range of genetic etiology, age-at-onset and presentation. Proportion 
      of polyQ and non-repeat expansion SCA was similar; the latter had a higher 
      genetic heterogeneity. While polyQ ataxias were typically linked to cerebellar 
      onset in adulthood, non-repeat expansion forms associated with early onset and 
      non-cerebellar presentations.

AB  - Hereditary ataxias are one of the <<anticipation diseases>> types. Spinocerebral 
      ataxia type 2 occurs when the number of CAG repeats in the coding region of the 
      ATXN2 gene exceeds 34 or more. In healthy people, the CAG repeat region in the 
      ATXN2 gene usually consists of 22-23 CAG trinucleotides. Mutations that increase 
      the length of CAG repeats can cause severe neurodegenerative and neuromuscular 
      disorders known as trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases. The mechanisms 
      causing such diseases are associated with non-canonical configurations that can 
      be formed in the CAG repeat region during replication, transcription or repair. 
      This makes it relevant to study the zones of open states that arise in the region 
      of CAG repeats under torque. The purpose of this work is to study, using 
      mathematical modeling, zones of open states in the region of CAG repeats of the 
      ATXN2 gene, caused by torque. It has been established that the torque effect on 
      the 1st exon of the ATXN2 gene, in addition to the formation of open states in 
      the promoter region, can lead to the formation of additional various sizes open 
      states zones in the CAG repeats region. Moreover, the frequency of additional 
      large zones genesis increases with increasing number of CAG repeats. The inverse 
      of this frequency correlates with the dependence of the disease onset average age 
      on the CAG repeats length. The obtained results will allow us to get closer to 
      understanding the genetic mechanisms that cause trinucleotide repeat diseases.

AB  - There is an obvious clinical-pathological overlap between essential tremor and 
      some known tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansion disorders. The aim is 
      to analyse whether these short tandem repeat genes, including ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, TBP, BEAN1, NOP56, DAB1, ATN1, 
      SADM12 and FMR1, are associated with familial essential tremor patients. Genetic 
      analysis of repeat sizes in tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansions was 
      performed in a large cohort of 515 familial essential tremor probands and 300 
      controls. The demographic and clinical features among carriers of pathogenic 
      expansions, intermediate repeats and non-carriers were compared. A total of 18 
      out of 515 (18/515, 3.7%) patients were found to have repeats expansions, 
      including 12 cases (12/515, 2.5%) with intermediate repeat expansions (one ATXN1, 
      eight TBP, two FMR1, one ATN1), and six cases (6/515, 1.2%) with pathogenic 
      expansions (one ATXN1, one ATXN2, one ATXN8OS, one PPP2R2B, one FMR1, one 
      SAMD12). There were no statistically significant differences in intermediate 
      repeats compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, there were no significant 
      differences in demographics and clinical features among individuals with 
      pathogenic expansions, intermediate repeat expansions carriers and non-carriers. 
      Our study indicates that the intermediate repeat expansion in tremor-associated 
      short tandem repeat expansions does not pose an increased risk for essential 
      tremor, and rare pathogenic expansion carriers have been found in the familial 
      essential tremor cohort. The diagnosis of essential tremor based solely on 
      clinical symptoms remains a challenge in distinguishing it from known short 
      tandem repeat expansions diseases with overlapping clinical-pathological 
      features.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are critical for regulating the 
      expression of genes in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, but miRNAs have not 
      been investigated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). SCA2, a dominantly 
      inherited progressive neurodegenerative polyglutamine (polyQ) disease, is caused 
      by a CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin-2 (ATXN2) gene. In this study, we 
      determined miRNA transcriptomes in SCA2-BAC-ATXN2[Q72] transgenic mice. METHODS: 
      We assessed the expression of miRNAs in SCA2 transgenic mouse cerebella using the 
      HiSeq Illumina sequencer. We used the miRNA target filter tool in Qiagen 
      Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to identify target genes of differentially 
      expressed miRNAs (DEmiRs) within in the SCA2 mouse transcriptomes and then 
      performed pathway analyses. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed significant changes in 
      the expression levels of multiple miRNAs in mice with SCA2. We identified 81 
      DEmiRs in mice with SCA2, with 52 miRNAs upregulated and 29 miRNAs downregulated 
      after onset of rotarod deficit. Subsequent IPA processing enabled us to establish 
      connections between these DEmiRs and specific biological regulatory functions. 
      Furthermore, by using the IPA miRNA target filter, we identified target genes of 
      DEmiRs in the SCA2-BAC-ATXN2[Q72] transcriptome data set and demonstrated their 
      significant impact on several biological functional and disease pathways. 
      DISCUSSION: Our study establishes the role of both DEmiRs and their targets in 
      SCA2 pathogenesis. By expressing mutant ATXN2 under the control of its endogenous 
      regulatory elements in the SCA2-BAC-ATXN2[Q72] mouse model, we identified a set 
      of DEmiRs that are shared across multiple neurodegenerative diseases including 
      other SCAs, Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), and amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis (ALS). There was a significant overlap of both DEmiRs and their 
      targets of BAC-ATXN2[Q72] transcriptomes in dysregulated pathways that 
      characterize SCA2. This observation also extended to dysregulated pathways in 
      ALS, AD, and PD. DEmiRs identified in this study may represent therapeutic 
      targets for neurodegeneration or lead to biomarkers for characterizing various 
      neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Investigating Repeat Expansions in NIPA1, NOP56, and NOTCH2NLC Genes: A Closer 
      Look at Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Patients from Southern Italy.

AB  - The discovery of hexanucleotide repeats expansion (RE) in Chromosome 9 Open 
      Reading frame 72 (C9orf72) as the major genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) and the association between intermediate repeats in Ataxin-2 
      (ATXN2) with the disorder suggest that repetitive sequences in the human genome 
      play a significant role in ALS pathophysiology. Investigating the frequency of 
      repeat expansions in ALS in different populations and ethnic groups is therefore 
      of great importance. Based on these premises, this study aimed to define the 
      frequency of REs in the NIPA1, NOP56, and NOTCH2NLC genes and the possible 
      associations between phenotypes and the size of REs in the Italian population. 
      Using repeat-primed-PCR and PCR-fragment analyses, we screened 302 
      El-Escorial-diagnosed ALS patients and compared the RE distribution to 167 age-, 
      gender-, and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. While the REs distribution was 
      similar between the ALS and control groups, a moderate association was observed 
      between longer RE lengths and clinical features such as age at onset, gender, 
      site of onset, and family history. In conclusion, this is the first study to 
      screen ALS patients from southern Italy for REs in NIPA1, NOP56, and NOTCH2NLC 
      genes, contributing to our understanding of ALS genetics. Our results highlighted 
      that the extremely rare pathogenic REs in these genes do not allow an association 
      with the disease.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In this work, we describe a new case of association between SCA2 
      and MND. CASE REPORT: A 58-year-old man who was diagnosed with spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 2 presented dysphagia and a significant decline in his ability to 
      walk, with a reduction in autonomy and the need to use a wheelchair. We performed 
      electromyography and electroneurography of the four limbs and of the cranial 
      district and motor-evoked potentials to study upper and lower motor neurons. 
      Referring to the revised El Escorial criteria of 2015, ALS diagnosis was made. 
      DISCUSSION: Considering different cases described in literature over the years, 
      SCA2 could represent an important risk factor for developing ALS. In particular, 
      the presence of alleles of ATXN2 with 27 and 28 CAG repeats seems to slightly 
      decrease the risk of developing the disease, which would instead be progressively 
      increased by the presence of alleles with 29, 30, 31, 32, and 33 repeats. The 
      exact physiopathological mechanism by which the mutation increases the risk of 
      developing the disease is currently unknown. Transcriptomic studies on mouse 
      models have demonstrated the involvement of several pathways, including the 
      innate immunity regulation by STING and the biosynthesis of fatty acid and 
      cholesterol by SREBP. CONCLUSION: CAG repeat expansions in the ATXN2 gene have 
      been associated with variable neurological presentations, which include SCA2, 
      ALS, Parkinsonism, or a combination of them. Further research is needed to 
      understand the relationship between SCA2 and ALS better and explore molecular 
      underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Expanded CAG repeats in coding regions of different genes are the most common 
      cause of dominantly inherited spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). These repeats are 
      unstable through the germline, and larger repeats lead to earlier onset. We 
      measured somatic expansion in blood samples collected from 30 SCA1, 50 SCA2, 74 
      SCA3, and 30 SCA7 individuals over a mean interval of 8.5 years, along with 
      postmortem tissues and fetal tissues from SCA1, SCA3, and SCA7 individuals to 
      examine somatic expansion at different stages of life. We showed that somatic 
      mosaicism in the blood increases over time. Expansion levels are significantly 
      different among SCAs and correlate with CAG repeat lengths. The level of 
      expansion is greater in individuals with SCA7 who manifest disease compared to 
      that of those who do not yet display symptoms. Brain tissues from SCA individuals 
      have larger expansions compared to the blood. The cerebellum has the lowest 
      mosaicism among the studied brain regions, along with a high expression of ATXNs 
      and DNA repair genes. This was the opposite in cortices, with the highest 
      mosaicism and lower expression of ATXNs and DNA repair genes. Fetal cortices did 
      not show repeat instability. This study shows that CAG repeats are increasingly 
      unstable during life in the blood and the brain of SCA individuals, with gene- 
      and tissue-specific patterns.

AB  - Genetic repeat expansions cause neuronal degeneration in amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis as well as other neurodegenerative disorders such as spinocerebellar 
      ataxia, Huntington's disease and Kennedy's disease. Repeat expansions in the same 
      gene can cause multiple clinical phenotypes. We aimed to characterize repeat 
      expansions in a Norwegian amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cohort. Norwegian 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (n = 414) and neurologically healthy 
      controls adjusted for age and gender (n = 713) were investigated for repeat 
      expansions in AR, ATXN1, ATXN2 and HTT using short read exome sequencing and the 
      ExpansionHunter software. Five amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (1.2%) and 
      two controls (0.3%) carried >/=36 repeats in HTT (P = 0.032), and seven amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis patients (1.7%) and three controls (0.4%) carried >/=29 repeats 
      in ATXN2 (P = 0.038). One male diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      carried a pathogenic repeat expansion in AR, and his diagnosis was revised to 
      Kennedy's disease. In ATXN1, 50 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (12.1%) 
      and 96 controls (13.5%) carried >/=33 repeats (P = 0.753). None of the patients 
      with repeat expansions in ATXN2 or HTT had signs of Huntington's disease or 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, based on a re-evaluation of medical records. The 
      diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was confirmed in all patients, with 
      the exception of one patient who had primary lateral sclerosis. Our findings 
      indicate that repeat expansions in HTT and ATXN2 are associated with increased 
      likelihood of developing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Further studies are 
      required to investigate the potential relationship between HTT repeat expansions 
      and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With disease-modifying drugs in reach for cerebellar ataxias, 
      fine-grained digital health measures are highly warranted to complement clinical 
      and patient-reported outcome measures in upcoming treatment trials and treatment 
      monitoring. These measures need to demonstrate sensitivity to capture change, in 
      particular in the early stages of the disease. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to unravel 
      gait measures sensitive to longitudinal change in the-particularly 
      trial-relevant-early stage of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). METHODS: We 
      performed a multicenter longitudinal study with combined cross-sectional and 
      1-year interval longitudinal analysis in early-stage SCA2 participants (n = 23, 
      including nine pre-ataxic expansion carriers; median, ATXN2 CAG repeat expansion 
      38 +/- 2; median, Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia [SARA] score 
      4.8 +/- 4.3). Gait was assessed using three wearable motion sensors during a 
      2-minute walk, with analyses focused on gait measures of spatio-temporal 
      variability that have shown sensitivity to ataxia severity (eg, lateral step 
      deviation). RESULTS: We found significant changes for gait measures between 
      baseline and 1-year follow-up with large effect sizes (lateral step deviation 
      P = 0.0001, effect size r(prb) = 0.78), whereas the SARA score showed no change 
      (P = 0.67). Sample size estimation indicates a required cohort size of n = 43 to 
      detect a 50% reduction in natural progression. Test-retest reliability and 
      minimal detectable change analysis confirm the accuracy of detecting 50% of the 
      identified 1-year change. CONCLUSIONS: Gait measures assessed by wearable sensors 
      can capture natural progression in early-stage SCA2 within just 1 year-in 
      contrast to a clinical ataxia outcome. Lateral step deviation represents a 
      promising outcome measure for upcoming multicenter interventional trials, 
      particularly in the early stages of cerebellar ataxia. (c) 2024 The Authors.

TI  - Intermediate Repeat Expansion in the ATXN2 Gene as a Risk Factor in the ALS and 
      FTD Spanish Population.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines12020356 [doi]
LID - 356
AB  - Intermediate CAG expansions in the gene ataxin-2 (ATXN2) are a known risk factor 
      for ALS, but little is known about their role in FTD risk. Moreover, their 
      contribution to the risk and phenotype of patients might vary in populations with 
      different genetic backgrounds. The aim of this study was to assess the 
      relationship of intermediate CAG expansions in ATXN2 with the risk and phenotype 
      of ALS and FTD in the Spanish population. Repeat-primed PCR was performed in 620 
      ALS and 137 FTD patients in three referral centers in Spain to determine the 
      exact number of CAG repeats. In our cohort, >/=27 CAG repeats in ATXN2 were 
      associated with a higher risk of developing ALS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.666 
      [1.471-4.882]; p = 0.0013) but not FTD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.446 [0.558-3.574]; p 
      = 0.44). Moreover, ALS patients with >/=27 CAG repeats in ATXN2 showed a shorter 
      survival rate compared to those with <27 repeats (hazard ratio [HR] 1.74 [1.18, 
      2.56], p = 0.005), more frequent limb onset (odds ratio [OR] = 2.34 
      [1.093-4.936]; p = 0.028) and a family history of ALS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.538 
      [1.375-4.634]; p = 0.002). Intermediate CAG expansions of >/=27 repeats in ATXN2 
      are associated with ALS risk but not with FTD in the Spanish population. ALS 
      patients carrying an intermediate expansion in ATXN2 show more frequent limb 
      onset but a worse prognosis than those without expansions. In patients carrying 
      C9orf72 expansions, the intermediate ATXN2 expansion might increase the 
      penetrance and modify the phenotype.

TI  - Clinical features, disease progression, and nuclear imaging in ATXN2-related 
      parkinsonism in a longitudinal cohort.
PG  - 3191-3200
LID - 10.1007/s10072-024-07383-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) with a low range of CAG repeat 
      expansion of ATXN2 gene can present with predominant or isolated parkinsonism 
      that closely resembles Parkinson's disease (PD). This study is aimed at comparing 
      clinical features, disease progression, and nuclear imaging between ATXN2-related 
      parkinsonism (ATXN2-P) and PD. METHODS: Three hundred and seventy-seven 
      clinically diagnosed PD with family history were screened by multiplex 
      ligation-dependent probe amplification, whole-exome sequencing or target 
      sequencing, and dynamic mutation testing of 10 SCA subtypes. The baseline and 
      longitudinal clinical features as well as the dual-tracer positron emission 
      tomography (PET) imaging were compared between ATXN2-P and genetically undefined 
      familial PD (GU-fPD). RESULTS: Fifteen ATXN2-P patients from 7 families and 50 
      randomly selected GU-fPD patients were evaluated. Significantly less resting 
      tremor and more symmetric signs were observed in ATXN2-P than GU-fPD. No 
      significant difference was found in motor progression and duration from onset to 
      occurrence of fluctuation, dyskinesia, and recurrent falls between the two 
      groups. Cognitive impairment and rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder were 
      more common in ATXN2-P. During follow-up, olfaction was relatively spared, and no 
      obvious progression of cognition dysfunction evaluated by Mini-Mental State 
      Examination scores was found in ATXN2-P. PET results of ATXN2-P demonstrated a 
      symmetric, diffuse, and homogenous dopamine transporter loss of bilateral 
      striatum and a glucose metabolism pattern inconsistent with that in PD. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Symmetric motor signs and unique nuclear imaging might be the clues 
      to distinguish ATXN2-P from GU-fPD.

AB  - Background: Episodic ataxias are rare neurological disorders characterized by 
      recurring episodes of imbalance and coordination difficulties. Obtaining 
      definitive molecular diagnoses poses challenges, as clinical presentation is 
      highly heterogeneous, and literature on the underlying genetics is limited. While 
      the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has significantly 
      contributed to Mendelian disorders genetics, interpretation of variants of 
      uncertain significance and other limitations inherent to individual methods still 
      leaves many patients undiagnosed. This study aimed to investigate the utility of 
      multi-omics for the identification and validation of molecular candidates in a 
      cohort of complex cases of ataxia with episodic presentation. Methods: Eight 
      patients lacking molecular diagnosis despite extensive clinical examination were 
      recruited following standard genetic testing. Whole genome and RNA sequencing 
      were performed on samples isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 
      Integration of expression and splicing data facilitated genomic variants 
      prioritization. Subsequently, long-read sequencing played a crucial role in the 
      validation of those candidate variants. Results: Whole genome sequencing 
      uncovered pathogenic variants in four genes (SPG7, ATXN2, ELOVL4, PMPCB). A 
      missense and a nonsense variant, both previously reported as likely pathogenic, 
      configured in trans in individual #1 (SPG7: c.2228T>C/p.I743T, 
      c.1861C>T/p.Q621*). An ATXN2 microsatellite expansion (CAG(32)) in another 
      late-onset case. In two separate individuals, intronic variants near splice sites 
      (ELOVL4: c.541 + 5G>A; PMPCB: c.1154 + 5G>C) were predicted to induce 
      loss-of-function splicing, but had never been reported as disease-causing. 
      Long-read sequencing confirmed the compound heterozygous variants configuration, 
      repeat expansion length, as well as splicing landscape for those pathogenic 
      variants. A potential genetic modifier of the ATXN2 expansion was discovered in 
      ZFYVE26 (c.3022C>T/p.R1008*). Conclusion: Despite failure to identify pathogenic 
      variants through clinical genetic testing, the multi-omics approach enabled the 
      molecular diagnosis in 50% of patients, also giving valuable insights for variant 
      prioritization in remaining cases. The findings demonstrate the value of 
      long-read sequencing for the validation of candidate variants in various 
      scenarios. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging complementary 
      omics technologies to unravel the underlying genetics in patients with unresolved 
      rare diseases such as ataxia. Molecular diagnoses not only hold significant 
      promise in improving patient care management, but also alleviates the burden of 
      diagnostic odysseys, more broadly enhancing quality of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) is a neurological disease characterized by 
      action tremor in upper arms. Although its high heritability and prevalence 
      worldwide, its etiology and association with other diseases are still unknown. 
      METHOD: We investigated 10 common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), including SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, SCA36, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA) in 92 early-onset familial ET pedigrees in China collected from 
      2016 to 2022. RESULT: We found one SCA12 proband carried 51 CAG repeats within 
      PPP2R2B gene and one SCA3 proband with intermediate CAG repeats (55) with ATXN3 
      gene. The other 90 ET probands all had normal repeat expansions. CONCLUSION: 
      Tremor can be the initial phenotype of certain SCA. For early-onset, familial ET 
      patients, careful physical examinations are needed before genetic SCA screening.

TI  - The Cerebellar Cognitive Affective/Schmahmann Syndrome Scale in Spinocerebellar

LID - 10.1007/s12311-023-01651-0 [doi]
AB  - The Cerebellar Cognitive Affective/Schmahmann Syndrome (CCAS) manifests as 
      impaired executive control, linguistic processing, visual spatial function, and 
      affect regulation. The CCAS has been described in the spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs), but its prevalence is unknown. We analyzed results of the CCAS/Schmahmann 
      Scale (CCAS-S), developed to detect and quantify CCAS, in two natural history 
      studies of 309 individuals Symptomatic for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, or SCA8, 
      26 individuals Pre-symptomatic for SCA1 or SCA3, and 37 Controls. We compared 
      total raw scores, domain scores, and total fail scores between Symptomatic, 
      Pre-symptomatic, and Control cohorts, and between SCA types. We calculated scale 
      sensitivity and selectivity based on CCAS category designation among Symptomatic 
      individuals and Controls, and correlated CCAS-S performance against age and 
      education, and in Symptomatic patients, against genetic repeat length, onset age, 
      disease duration, motor ataxia, depression, and fatigue. Definite CCAS was 
      identified in 46% of the Symptomatic group. False positive rate among Controls 
      was 5.4%. Symptomatic individuals had poorer global CCAS-S performance than 
      Controls, accounting for age and education. The domains of semantic fluency, 
      phonemic fluency, and category switching that tap executive function and 
      linguistic processing consistently separated Symptomatic individuals from 
      Controls. CCAS-S scores correlated most closely with motor ataxia. Controls were 
      similar to Pre-symptomatic individuals whose nearness to symptom onset was 
      unknown. The use of the CCAS-S identifies a high CCAS prevalence in a large 
      cohort of SCA patients, underscoring the utility of the scale and the notion that 
      the CCAS is the third cornerstone of clinical ataxiology.

AB  - Neurologists have a difficult time identifying sporadic cerebellar ataxia. 
      Multiple system atrophy of the cerebellar type (MSA-C), spontaneous late cortical 
      cerebellar atrophy, and prolonged alcohol use are a few possible causes. In a 
      group of people with sporadic cerebellar ataxia that was not MSA-C, an 
      autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) mutation was recently discovered. 
      Chinese single-hospital cohort will be used in this study to genetic screen for 
      SCA-related genes. One hundred forty individuals with CA were monitored over 8 
      years. Thirty-one individuals had familial CA, 109 patients had sporadic CA, 73 
      had MSA-C, and 36 had non-MSA-C sporadic CA. In 28 of the 31 non-MSA-C sporadic 
      patients who requested the test, we carried out gene analysis, including SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, SCA31, and 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The control group consisted of 
      family members of the patients. In 57% of the instances with spontaneous CA that 
      were not MSA-C, gene abnormalities were discovered. The most frequent exception 
      among individuals with sporadic CA was SCA6 (36%), followed by monsters in SCA1, 
      2, 3, 8, and DRPLA. In contrast, 75% of the patients with familial CA had gene 
      abnormalities, the most frequent of which was SCA6 abnormality. The age of 69 vs 
      59 was higher, and the CAG repeat length was a minor age of 23 vs 25 in the 
      former instances compared to the last one among individuals with SCA6 anomalies 
      that were sporadic as opposed to familial cases. In sporadic CA, 
      autosomal-dominant mutations in SCA genes, notably in SCA6, are common. Although 
      the cause of the increased incidence of SCA6 mutations is unknown, it may be 
      related to a greater age of onset and varied penetrance of SCA6 mutations.

TI  - The Frequency of Intermediate Alleles in Patients with Cerebellar Phenotypes.
PG  - 1135-1145
LID - 10.1007/s12311-023-01620-7 [doi]
AB  - Cerebellar syndromes are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and can be 
      classified as hereditary, neurodegenerative non-hereditary, or acquired. Few data 
      are available on the frequency of each form in the clinical setting. Growing 
      interest is emerging regarding the genetic forms caused by triplet repeat 
      expansions. Alleles with repeat expansion lower than the pathological threshold, 
      termed intermediate alleles (IAs), have been found to be associated with disease 
      manifestation. In order to assess the relevance of IAs as a cause of cerebellar 
      syndromes, we enrolled 66 unrelated Italian ataxic patients and described the 
      distribution of the different etiology of their syndromes and the frequency of 
      IAs. Each patient underwent complete clinical, hematological, and 
      neurophysiological assessments, neuroimaging evaluations, and genetic tests for 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (SCA) and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome (FXTAS). We identified the following diagnostic categories: 28% sporadic 
      adult-onset ataxia, 18% cerebellar variant of multiple system atrophy, 9% 
      acquired forms, 9% genetic forms with full-range expansion, and 12% cases with 
      intermediate-range expansion. The IAs were six in the FMR1 gene, two in the gene 
      responsible for SCA8, and one in the ATXN2 gene. The clinical phenotype of 
      patients carrying the IAs resembles, in most of the cases, the one associated 
      with full-range expansion. Our study provides an exhaustive description of the 
      causes of cerebellar ataxia, estimating for the first time the frequency of IAs 
      in SCAs- and FXTAS-associated genes. The high percentage of cases with IAs 
      supports further screening among patients with cerebellar syndromes.

TI  - Prevalence of repeat expansions causing autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      ataxias in Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan.
PG  - 27-31

AB  - In Japan, approximately 30% of spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) is hereditary, 
      and more than 90% of hereditary SCD is autosomal dominant SCD (AD-SCD). We have 
      previously reported the types of AD-SCD in Hokkaido, twice. In this study, we 
      investigated the status of AD-SCD mainly due to repeat expansions, covering the 
      period since the last report. We performed genetic analysis for 312 patients with 
      a clinical diagnosis of SCD, except for multiple system atrophy at medical 
      institutions in Hokkaido between January 2007 and December 2020. The median age 
      at the time of analysis was 58 (1-86) years. Pathogenic variants causing AD-SCD 
      due to repeat expansion were found in 61.5% (192 cases). Spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) 6 was the most common type in 25.3% (79 cases), followed by Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD)/SCA3 in 13.8% (43), SCA1 in 6.4% (20), SCA2 in 5.1% (16), SCA31 in 
      4.8% (15), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy in 4.8% (15), SCA7 in 0.6% (2), 
      and SCA8 in 0.6% (2). SCA17, 27B, 36, and 37 were not found. Compared to previous 
      reports, this study found a higher prevalence of SCA6 and a lower prevalence of 
      MJD/SCA3. An increasing number of cases identified by genetic testing, including 
      cases with no apparent family history, accurately revealed the distribution of 
      disease types in Hokkaido.

TI  - Development of an isogenic human cell trio that models polyglutamine disease.
PG  - 179-189
LID - 10.1266/ggs.22-00030 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are rare autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative 
      diseases associated with the expansion of glutamine-encoding triplet repeats in 
      certain genes. To investigate the functional influence of repeat expansion on 
      disease mechanisms, we applied a biallelic genome-engineering platform that we 
      recently established, called Universal Knock-in System or UKiS, to develop a 
      human cell trio, a set of three isogenic cell lines that are homozygous for two 
      different numbers of repeats (first and second lines) or heterozygous for the two 
      repeat numbers (third line). As an example of a polyQ disease, we chose 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). In a pseudodiploid human cell line, both 
      alleles of the glutamine-encoding triplet repeat in the SCA2-causing gene, ataxin 
      2 or ATXN2, were first knocked in with a donor sequence encoding both thymidine 
      kinase and either puromycin or blasticidin resistance proteins under dual drug 
      selection. The knocked-in donor alleles were then substituted with a payload 
      having either 22 or 76 triplet repeats in ATXN2 by ganciclovir negative 
      selection. The two-step substitution and subsequent SNP typing and genomic 
      sequencing confirmed that the SCA2-modeling isogenic cell trio was obtained: 
      three clones of 22-repeat homozygotes, two clones of 22/76-repeat heterozygotes 
      and two clones of 76-repeat homozygotes. Finally, RT-PCR and immunoblotting using 
      the obtained clones showed that, consistent with previous observations, glutamine 
      tract expansion reduced transcriptional and translational expression of ATXN2. 
      The cell clones with homozygous long-repeat alleles, which are rarely obtained 
      from patients with SCA2, showed more drastic reduction of ATXN2 expression than 
      the heterozygous clones. This study thus demonstrates the potential of UKiS, 
      which is a beneficial platform for the efficient development of cell models not 
      only for polyQ diseases but also for any other genetic diseases, which may 
      accelerate our deeper understanding of disease mechanisms and cell-based 
      screening for therapeutic drugs.

AB  - There are more than 40 types of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), most of which are 
      caused by abnormal expansion of short tandem repeats at various gene loci. These 
      phenotypically similar disorders require molecular testing at multiple loci by 
      fluorescent PCR and capillary electrophoresis to identify the causative repeat 
      expansion. We describe a simple strategy to screen for the more common SCA1, 
      SCA2, and SCA3 by rapidly detecting the abnormal CAG repeat expansion at the 
      ATXN1, ATXN2, and ATXN3 loci using melting curve analysis of triplet-primed PCR 
      products. Each of the three separate assays employs a plasmid DNA carrying a 
      known repeat size to generate a threshold melt peak temperature, which 
      effectively distinguishes expansion-positive samples from those without a repeat 
      expansion. Samples that are screened positive based on their melt peak profiles 
      are subjected to capillary electrophoresis for repeat sizing and genotype 
      confirmation. These screening assays are robust and provide accurate detection of 
      the repeat expansion while eliminating the need for fluorescent PCR and capillary 
      electrophoresis for every sample.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To perform a screening for Huntington disease (HD) phenocopies in a 
      Swedish cohort. METHODS: Seventy-three DNA samples negative for HD were assessed 
      at a tertiary center in Stockholm. The screening included analyses for 
      C9orf72-frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9orf72-FTD/ALS), 
      octapeptide repeat insertions (OPRIs) in PRNP associated with inherited prion 
      diseases (IPD), Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2), spinocerebellar ataxia-2 
      (SCA2), spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) and spinocerebellar ataxia-17 (SCA17). 
      Targeted genetic analysis was carried out in two cases based on the salient 
      phenotypic features. RESULTS: The screening identified two patients with SCA17, 
      one patient with IPD associated with 5-OPRI but none with nucleotide expansions 
      in C9orf72 or for HDL2, SCA2 or SCA3. Furthermore, SGCE-myoclonic-dystonia 11 
      (SGCE-M-D) and benign hereditary chorea (BHC) was diagnosed in two sporadic 
      cases. WES identified VUS in STUB1 in two patients with predominant cerebellar 
      ataxia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are in keeping with previous screenings and 
      suggest that other genes yet to be discovered are involved in the etiology of HD 
      phenocopies.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite recent advances, it is not clear whether the 
      various genes/genetic variants related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 
      interact in modifying patients' phenotype. The aim of this study was to determine 
      whether the copresence of genetic variants related to ALS has interactive effects 
      on the course of the disease. METHODS: The study population includes 1,245 
      patients with ALS identified through the Piemonte Register for ALS between 2007 
      and 2016 and not carrying superoxide dismutase type 1, TAR DNA binding protein, 
      and fused in sarcoma pathogenic variants. Controls were 766 Italian participants 
      age-matched, sex-matched, and geographically matched to cases. We considered 
      Unc-13 homolog A (UNC13A) (rs12608932), calmodulin binding transcription 
      activator 1 (CAMTA1) (rs2412208), solute carrier family 11 member 2 (SLC11A2) 
      (rs407135), and zinc finger protein 512B (ZNF512B) (rs2275294) variants, as well 
      as ataxin-2 (ATXN2) polyQ intermediate repeats (>/=31) and chromosome 9 open 
      reading frame 72 (C9orf72) GGGGCC intronic expansions (>/=30). RESULTS: The median 
      survival time of the whole cohort was 2.67 years (interquartile range [IQR] 
      1.67-5.25). In univariate analysis, only C9orf72 (2.51 years, IQR 1.74-3.82; p = 
      0.016), ATXN2 (1.82 years, IQR 1.08-2.33; p < 0.001), and UNC13A (C/C) (2.3 
      years, IQR 1.3-3.9; p < 0.001) significantly reduced survival. In Cox 
      multivariable analysis, CAMTA1 also emerged to be independently related to 
      survival (hazard ratio 1.13, 95% CI 1.001-1.30, p = 0.048). The copresence of 2 
      detrimental alleles/expansions was correlated with shorter survival. In 
      particular, the median survival of patients with CAMTA1 (G/G+G/T) and UNC13A 
      (C/C) alleles was 1.67 years (1.16-3.08) compared with 2.75 years (1.67-5.26) of 
      the patients not carrying these variants (p < 0.001); the survival of patients 
      with CAMTA1 (G/G+G/T) alleles and ATXN2 (>/=31) intermediate polyQ repeats was 1.75 
      years (0.84-2.18) (p < 0.001); the survival of patients with ATXN2 (>/=31) polyQ 
      repeats and UNC13A (C/C) allele was 1.33 years (0.84-1.75) (p < 0.001); the 
      survival of patients with C9ORF72 (>/=30) and UNC13A (C/C) allele was 1.66 years 
      (1.41-2.16). Each pair of detrimental alleles/expansions was associated to 
      specific clinical phenotypes. DISCUSSION: We showed that gene variants acting as 
      modifiers of ALS survival or phenotype can act on their own or in unison. 
      Overall, 54% of patients carried at least 1 detrimental common variant or repeat 
      expansion, emphasizing the clinical impact of our findings. In addition, the 
      identification of the interactive effects of modifier genes represents a crucial 
      clue for explaining ALS clinical heterogeneity and should be considered when 
      designing and interpreting clinical trials results.

AB  - Pathogenic short tandem repeat (STR) expansions cause over 20 neurodegenerative 
      diseases. To determine the contribution of STRs in sporadic amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), we used ExpansionHunter, 
      REviewer, and polymerase chain reaction validation to assess 21 neurodegenerative 
      disease-associated STRs in whole-genome sequencing data from 608 patients with 
      sporadic ALS, 68 patients with sporadic FTD, and 4703 matched controls. We also 
      propose a data-derived outlier detection method for defining allele thresholds in 
      rare STRs. Excluding C9orf72 repeat expansions, 17.6% of clinically diagnosed ALS 
      and FTD cases had at least one expanded STR allele reported to be pathogenic or 
      intermediate for another neurodegenerative disease. We identified and validated 
      162 disease-relevant STR expansions in C9orf72 (ALS/FTD), ATXN1 [spinal 
      cerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1)], ATXN2 (SCA2), ATXN8 (SCA8), TBP (SCA17), HTT 
      (Huntington's disease), DMPK [myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)], CNBP (DM2), and 
      FMR1 (fragile-X disorders). Our findings suggest clinical and pathological 
      pleiotropy of neurodegenerative disease genes and highlight their importance in 
      ALS and FTD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: CAG-repeat expansions in Ataxin 2 (ATXN2) are known to cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), but CAA interrupted expansions may also 
      result in autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (AD PD). However, because of 
      technical limitations, such expansions are not explored in whole exome sequencing 
      (WES) data. OBJECTIVES: To identify ATXN2 expansions using WES data from PD 
      cases. METHODS: We explored WES data from a cohort of 477 index cases with PD 
      using ExpansionHunter (Illumina DRAGEN Bio-IT Platform, San Diego, CA). Putative 
      expansions were confirmed by combining polymerase chain reaction and fragment 
      length analysis followed by sub-cloning and sequencing methods. RESULTS: Using 
      ExpansionHunter, we identified three patients from two families with AD PD 
      carrying either ATXN2 22/39 or 22/37 repeats, both interrupted by four CAA 
      repeats. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the usefulness of WES to detect 
      pathogenic CAG repeat expansions, which were found in 1.7% of AD PD in the ATXN2 
      gene in our exome dataset.

TI  - Genetic variability in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
PG  - 3760-3769
LID - 10.1093/brain/awad120 [doi]
AB  - With the advent of gene therapies for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), there 
      is a surge in gene testing for this disease. Although there is ample experience 
      with gene testing for C9orf72, SOD1, FUS and TARDBP in familial ALS, large 
      studies exploring genetic variation in all ALS-associated genes in sporadic ALS 
      (sALS) are still scarce. Gene testing in a diagnostic setting is challenging, 
      given the complex genetic architecture of sALS, for which there are genetic 
      variants with large and small effect sizes. Guidelines for the interpretation of 
      genetic variants in gene panels and for counselling of patients are lacking. We 
      aimed to provide a thorough characterization of genetic variability in ALS genes 
      by applying the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria 
      on whole genome sequencing data from a large cohort of 6013 sporadic ALS patients 
      and 2411 matched controls from Project MinE. We studied genetic variation in 90 
      ALS-associated genes and applied customized ACMG-criteria to identify pathogenic 
      and likely pathogenic variants. Variants of unknown significance were collected 
      as well. In addition, we determined the length of repeat expansions in C9orf72, 
      ATXN1, ATXN2 and NIPA1 using the ExpansionHunter tool. We found C9orf72 repeat 
      expansions in 5.21% of sALS patients. In 50 ALS-associated genes, we did not 
      identify any pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. In 5.89%, a pathogenic or 
      likely pathogenic variant was found, most commonly in SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, NEK1, 
      OPTN or TBK1. Significantly more cases carried at least one pathogenic or likely 
      pathogenic variant compared to controls (odds ratio 1.75; P-value 1.64 x 10-5). 
      Isolated risk factors in ATXN1, ATXN2, NIPA1 and/or UNC13A were detected in 
      17.33% of cases. In 71.83%, we did not find any genetic clues. A combination of 
      variants was found in 2.88%. This study provides an inventory of pathogenic and 
      likely pathogenic genetic variation in a large cohort of sALS patients. Overall, 
      we identified pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in 11.13% of ALS patients 
      in 38 known ALS genes. In line with the oligogenic hypothesis, we found 
      significantly more combinations of variants in cases compared to controls. Many 
      variants of unknown significance may contribute to ALS risk, but diagnostic 
      algorithms to reliably identify and weigh them are lacking. This work can serve 
      as a resource for counselling and for the assembly of gene panels for ALS. 
      Further characterization of the genetic architecture of sALS is necessary given 
      the growing interest in gene testing in ALS.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Plasma neurofilament light (NfL), glial fibrillary 
      acidic protein (GFAP), phosphorylated-tau (p-tau), and beta-amyloid (Abeta) have 
      emerged as promising markers in several neurodegenerative disorders, but whether 
      they can be used as biomarkers in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) is yet to be 
      determined. This study aimed to identify sensitive plasma markers for SCA and 
      investigate their effectiveness in tracking ataxia severity, cognition, non-motor 
      symptoms, and brain atrophy. METHODS: This observational study recruited 
      consecutive participants from Huashan Hospital and the CABLE study from November 
      2019. Patients with SCA were genetically diagnosed, grouped according to the 
      ataxia severity, and compared with healthy older individuals and patients with 
      multiple system atrophy type C (MSA-C). Plasma NfL, GFAP, p-tau, and Abeta levels 
      were measured by Simoa in all participants. Analysis of covariance, Spearman 
      correlation, and multivariable regression were used to explore candidate markers 
      in SCA. RESULTS: A total of 190 participants (60 SCA, 56 MSA-C, and 74 healthy 
      controls) were enrolled. Plasma NfL level increased early in the pre-ataxic stage 
      of SCA (32.23 +/- 3.07 vs. 11.41 +/- 6.62 pg/mL in controls), was positively 
      associated with the ataxia severity (r = 0.45, P = 0.005) and CAG repeat length 
      (r = 0.51, P = 0.001), varied among the different SCA subtypes 
      (39.57 +/- 13.50 pg/mL in SCA3, which was higher than 28.17 +/- 8.02 pg/mL in SCA2, 
      17.08 +/- 6.78 pg/mL in SCA8, and 24.44 +/- 18.97 pg/mL in rare SCAs; P < 0.05), and 
      was associated with brainstem atrophy. NfL alone (area under the curve [AUC] 
      0.867) or combined with p-tau181 and Abeta (AUC 0.929), showed excellent performance 
      in discriminating SCA patients from controls. Plasma GFAP distinguished SCA from 
      MSA-C with moderate accuracy (AUC > 0.700) and correlated with cognitive 
      performance and cortical atrophy. Changes in levels of p-tau181 and Abeta were 
      observed in SCA patients compared to controls. They were both correlated with 
      cognition, while Abeta was also associated with non-motor symptoms, such as anxiety 
      and depression. DISCUSSION: Plasma NfL may serve as a sensitive biomarker for 
      SCA, and its level is elevated in the pre-ataxic stage. The different performance 
      of NfL and GFAP indicates differences in the underlying neuropathology of SCA and 
      MSA-C. Moreover, amyloid markers may be useful for detecting memory dysfunction 
      and other non-motor symptoms in SCA.

TI  - TR-FRET-Based Immunoassay to Measure Ataxin-2 as a Target Engagement Marker in 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2.
PG  - 3553-3567
LID - 10.1007/s12035-023-03294-y [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominantly inherited 
      neurodegenerative disease, which belongs to the trinucleotide repeat disease 
      group with a CAG repeat expansion in exon 1 of the ATXN2 gene resulting in an 
      ataxin-2 protein with an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ)-stretch. The disease is 
      late manifesting leading to early death. Today, therapeutic interventions to cure 
      the disease or even to decelerate disease progression are not available yet. 
      Furthermore, primary readout parameter for disease progression and therapeutic 
      intervention studies are limited. Thus, there is an urgent need for quantifiable 
      molecular biomarkers such as ataxin-2 becoming even more important due to 
      numerous potential protein-lowering therapeutic intervention strategies. The aim 
      of this study was to establish a sensitive technique to measure the amount of 
      soluble polyQ-expanded ataxin-2 in human biofluids to evaluate ataxin-2 protein 
      levels as prognostic and/or therapeutic biomarker in SCA2. Time-resolved 
      fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) was used to establish a polyQ-expanded 
      ataxin-2-specific immunoassay. Two different ataxin-2 antibodies and two 
      different polyQ-binding antibodies were validated in three different 
      concentrations and tested in cellular and animal tissue as well as in human cell 
      lines, comparing different buffer conditions to evaluate the best assay 
      conditions. We established a TR-FRET-based immunoassay for soluble polyQ-expanded 
      ataxin-2 and validated measurements in human cell lines including iPSC-derived 
      cortical neurons. Additionally, our immunoassay was sensitive enough to monitor 
      small ataxin-2 expression changes by siRNA or starvation treatment. We 
      successfully established the first sensitive ataxin-2 immunoassay to measure 
      specifically soluble polyQ-expanded ataxin-2 in human biomaterials.

TI  - NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats are not expanded in Italian amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      patients.

AB  - Repeat expansions in genes other than C9orf72 and ATXN2 have been recently 
      associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Indeed, an abnormal number 
      of GGC repeats in NOTCH2NLC has been recently reported in 0.7% of sporadic ALS 
      patients from mainland China. This finding was not confirmed in an ALS cohort of 
      subjects from Taiwan. As the involvement of expanded NOTCH2NLC alleles in ALS is 
      debated, we addressed this point by evaluating NOTCH2NLC repeat expansions in an 
      Italian cohort of ALS patients. A screening analysis of NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats was 
      performed by repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR) in a cohort of 385 
      probable/definite ALS Italian patients. Mean age at onset was 60.5 years (SD 
      13.7), and 60.9% were males. Sporadic cases were 357 (92.7%), and most patients 
      had a spinal onset (71.8%). None of our patients showed the typical sawtooth tail 
      pattern on RP-PCR, thus excluding abnormal repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC. 
      Overall, we suggest that NOTCH2NLC expanded alleles might be absent or at least 
      extremely rare in ALS Italian patients. Further investigations in larger cohorts 
      with different ethnic backgrounds are required to support the involvement of 
      NOTCH2NLC in ALS.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxias (CAs) represent a group of autosomal dominant and recessive 
      neurodegenerative disorders affecting cerebellum with or without spinal cord. 
      Overall, CAs have preponderance for tandem nucleotide repeat expansions as an 
      etiological factor (10 TREs explain nearly 30-40% of ataxia cohort globally). The 
      experience of 10 years of common genetic ataxia subtypes for  approximately 5600 patients' 
      referrals (Pan-India) received at a single center is shared herein. Frequencies 
      (in %, n) of SCA types and FRDA in the sample cohort are observed as follows: 
      SCA12 (8.6%, 490); SCA2 (8.5%, 482); SCA1 (4.8%, 272); SCA3 (2%, 113); SCA7 
      (0.5%, 28); SCA6 (0.1%, 05); SCA17 (0.1%, 05), and FRDA (2.2%, 127). A 
      significant amount of variability in TRE lengths at each locus is observed, we 
      noted presence of biallelic expansion, co-occurrence of SCA-subtypes, and the 
      presence of premutable normal alleles. The frequency of mutated GAA-FRDA allele 
      in healthy controls is 1/158 (0.63%), thus an expected FRDA prevalence of 1:100 
      000 persons. The data of this study are relevant not only for clinical decision 
      making but also for guidance in direction of genetic investigations, 
      transancestral comparison of genotypes, and lastly provide insight for policy 
      decision for the consideration of SCAs under rare disease category.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic efficacy of clinical 
      exome-targeted sequencing (CES) and spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36) screening 
      in a real-life cohort of patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) from Eastern Spain. 
      METHODS: A total of 130 unrelated patients with CA, negative for common 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, 
      SCA17, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA], and Friedreich ataxia), were 
      studied with CES. Bioinformatic and genotype-phenotype analyses were performed to 
      assess the pathogenicity of the variants encountered. Copy number variants were 
      analyzed when appropriate. In undiagnosed dominant and sporadic cases, repeat 
      primed PCR was used to screen for the presence of a repeat expansion in the NOP56 
      gene. RESULTS: CES identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 50 
      families (39%), including 23 novel variants. Overall, there was a high genetic 
      heterogeneity, and the most frequent genetic diagnosis was SPG7 (n = 15), 
      followed by SETX (n = 6), CACNA1A (n = 5), POLR3A (n = 4), and SYNE1 (n = 3). In 
      addition, 17 families displayed likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants in 14 
      different genes: KCND3 (n = 2), KIF1C (n = 2), CYP27A1A (n = 2), AFG3L2 (n = 1), 
      ANO10 (n = 1), CAPN1 (n = 1), CWF19L1 (n = 1), ITPR1 (n = 1), KCNA1 (n = 1), OPA1 
      (n = 1), PNPLA6 (n = 1), SPG11 (n = 1), SPTBN2 (n = 1), and TPP1 (n = 1). 
      Twenty-two novel variants were characterized. SCA36 was diagnosed in 11 families, 
      all with autosomal dominant (AD) presentation. SCA36 screening increased the 
      total diagnostic rate to 47% (n = 61/130). Ultimately, undiagnosed patients 
      showed delayed age at onset (p < 0.05) and were more frequently sporadic. 
      DISCUSSION: Our study provides insight into the genetic landscape of CA in 
      Eastern Spain. Although CES was an effective approach to capture genetic 
      heterogeneity, most patients remained undiagnosed. SCA36 was found to be a 
      relatively frequent form and, therefore, should be tested prior to CES in 
      familial AD presentations in particular geographical regions.

TI  - Moyamoya associated with Turner syndrome in a patient with type 2 spinocerebellar 
      ataxia-Occam's razor or Hickam's dictum: a case report.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Turner syndrome (TS) is a rare condition associated with a completely 
      or partially missing X chromosome that affects 1 in 2500 girls. TS increases the 
      risk of autoimmune diseases, including Graves' disease (GD). Moyamoya disease is 
      a rare cerebral arteriopathy of unknown etiology characterized by progressive 
      bilateral stenosis of the internal carotid artery and its branches. Both TS and 
      GD have been associated with Moyamoya. Type 2 spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA2) is an 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia caused by a CAG repeat expansion in ATXN2. 
      We present the first case of Moyamoya syndrome in a patient with a previous 
      diagnosis of TS and GD who tested positive for SCA2 and had imaging findings 
      compatible with an overlap of SCA2 and Moyamoya. CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old 
      woman presented with mild gait imbalance for 2 years. Her family history was 
      positive for type 2 spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA2). She had been diagnosed with 
      Turner Syndrome (45,X) and Graves disease three years before. Brain MRI revealed 
      bilateral frontal and parietal cystic encephalomalacia in watershed zones, 
      atrophy of pons, middle cerebellar peduncles and cerebellum. MR angiography 
      showed progressive stenosis of both internal carotid arteries with 
      lenticulostriate collaterals, suggestive of Moya-Moya disease. Molecular analysis 
      confirmed the diagnosis of SCA2. CONCLUSIONS: With increased availability of 
      tools for genetic diagnosis, physicians need to be aware of the possibility of a 
      single patient presenting two or more rare diseases. This report underscores the 
      modern dilemmas created by increasingly accurate imaging techniques and available 
      and extensive genetic testing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect the clinical characteristics of patients with amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis (ALS) carrying an intermediate ATXN2 polyQ number of repeats in 
      a large population-based series of Italian patients with ALS. METHODS: The study 
      population includes 1330 patients with ALS identified through the Piemonte and 
      Valle d'Aosta Register for ALS, diagnosed between 2007 and 2019 and not carrying 
      C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP and FUS mutations. Controls were 1274 age, sex and 
      geographically matched Italian subjects, identified through patients' general 
      practitioners. RESULTS: We found 42 cases and 4 controls with>/=31 polyQ repeats, 
      corresponding to an estimated OR of 10.4 (95% CI 3.3 to 29.0). Patients with>/=31 
      polyQ repeats (ATXN2+) compared with those without repeat expansion (ATXN2-) had 
      more frequently a spinal onset (p=0.05), a shorter diagnostic delay (p=0.004), a 
      faster rate of ALSFRS-R progression (p=0.004) and King's progression (p=0.004), 
      and comorbid frontotemporal dementia (7 (28.0%) vs 121 (13.4%), p=0.037). ATXN2+ 
      patients had a 1-year shorter survival (ATXN2+ patients 1.82 years, 95% CI 1.08 
      to 2.51; ATXN2- 2.84 years, 95% CI 1.67 to 5.58, p=0.0001). ATXN2 polyQ 
      intermediate repeats was independently related to a worse outcome in Cox 
      multivariable analysis (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: In our population-based cohort, 
      ATXN2+ patients with ALS have a distinctive phenotype, characterised by a more 
      rapid disease course and a shorter survival. In addition, ATXN2+ patients have a 
      more severe impairment of cognitive functions. These findings have relevant 
      implications on clinical practice, including the possibility of refining the 
      individual prognostic prediction and improving the design of ALS clinical trials, 
      in particular as regards as those targeted explicitly to ATXN2.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore whether the repeat lengths of the chromosome 9 open reading 
      frame 72 (C9orf72) gene and the ataxin-2 (ATXN2) gene in amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) patients without C9orf72 repeat expansions confer a risk of ALS 
      or survival disadvantages in ALS. METHODS: We screened a hospital-based cohort of 
      Chinese patients with sporadic ALS without C9orf72 repeat expansions and 
      neurologically healthy controls for C9orf72 GGGGCC and AXTN2 CAG repeat length to 
      compare the frequency of possible detrimental length alleles using several 
      thresholds. Furthermore, the clinical features of ALS were compared between 
      patients with ALS subgroups using different length thresholds of maximum C9orf72 
      and ATXN2 repeat alleles, such as sex, age of onset, diagnostic delay, and 
      survival. RESULTS: Overall, 879 sporadic patients with ALS and 535 controls were 
      included and the repeat lengths of the C9orf72 and ATXN2 were both detected. We 
      found significant survival differences in patients using a series of C9orf72 
      repeat length thresholds from 2 to 5, among which the most significant difference 
      was at the cutoff value of 2 (repeats 2 vs. >2: median survival 67 vs. 55 months, 
      log-rank p = 0.032). Furthermore, Cox regression analysis revealed the role of 
      age of onset [hazard ratio (HR) 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.05, p < 0.001], diagnostic 
      delay (0.95, 0.94-0.96, p < 0.001), and carrying C9orf72 repeat length of 2 
      (0.72, 0.59-0.89, p = 0.002) in the survival of patients without C9orf72 repeat 
      expansions. In addition, bulbar onset was associated with poorer survival when 
      the patients carried the maximum C9orf72 repeat allele over 2 (1.81, 1.32-2.48, p 
      < 0.001). However, no survival difference was found when applying a series of 
      continuous cutoff values of ATXN2 or stratified by C9orf72 repeats of 2. 
      CONCLUSION: The length of 2 in the maximum C9orf72 repeat allele was identified 
      to be associated with favorable survival in ALS patients without C9orf72 repeat 
      expansions. Our findings from the clinical setting implicated the possible cutoff 
      definition of detrimental C9orf72 repeats, which should be helpful in the 
      understanding of genetics in ALS and in clinical genetic counseling.

TI  - The S-Factor, a New Measure of Disease Severity in Spinocerebellar Ataxia: 
      Findings and Implications.
PG  - 790-809
LID - 10.1007/s12311-022-01424-1 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are progressive neurodegenerative disorders, but 
      there is no metric that predicts disease severity over time. We hypothesized that 
      by developing a new metric, the Severity Factor (S-Factor) using immutable 
      disease parameters, it would be possible to capture disease severity independent 
      of clinical rating scales. Extracting data from the CRC-SCA and READISCA natural 
      history studies, we calculated the S-Factor for 438 participants with symptomatic 
      SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6, as follows: ((length of CAG repeat expansion - maximum 
      normal repeat length) /maximum normal repeat length) x (current age - age at 
      disease onset) x 10). Within each SCA type, the S-Factor at the first Scale for 
      the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) visit (baseline) was correlated 
      against scores on SARA and other motor and cognitive assessments. In 281 
      participants with longitudinal data, the slope of the S-Factor over time was 
      correlated against slopes of scores on SARA and other motor rating scales. At 
      baseline, the S-Factor showed moderate-to-strong correlations with SARA and other 
      motor rating scales at the group level, but not with cognitive performance. 
      Longitudinally the S-Factor slope showed no consistent association with the slope 
      of performance on motor scales. Approximately 30% of SARA slopes reflected a 
      trend of non-progression in motor symptoms. The S-Factor is an 
      observer-independent metric of disease burden in SCAs. It may be useful at the 
      group level to compare cohorts at baseline in clinical studies. Derivation and 
      examination of the S-factor highlighted challenges in the use of clinical rating 
      scales in this population.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating, heterogeneous 
      neurodegenerative neuromuscular disease that leads to a fatal outcome within 
      2-5 years, and yet, a precise nature of the association between its major 
      phenotypes and the cerebellar role in ALS pathology remains unknown. Recently, 
      repeat expansions in several genes in which variants appreciably contribute to 
      cerebellar pathology, including C9orf72, NIPA1, ATXN2 and ATXN1, have been found 
      to confer a significant risk for ALS. To better define this relationship, we 
      performed MAGMA gene-based analysis and tissue enrichment analysis using 
      genome-wide association study summary statistics based on a study of 27,205 
      people with ALS and 110,881 controls. Our preliminary results imply a striking 
      cerebellar tissue specificity and further support increasing calls for 
      re-evaluation of the cerebellar role in the ALS pathology.

AB  - CAG repeat expansions in the ATXN2 (ataxin-2) gene can cause the autosomal 
      dominant disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) as well as increase the 
      risk of ALS. Abnormal molecular, motor, and neurophysiological phenotypes in SCA2 
      mouse models are normalized by lowering ATXN2 transcription, and reduction of 
      nonmutant Atxn2 expression has been shown to increase the life span of mice 
      overexpressing the TDP-43 (transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa) ALS 
      protein, demonstrating the potential benefits of targeting ATXN2 transcription in 
      humans. Here, we describe a quantitative high-throughput screen to identify 
      compounds that lower ATXN2 transcription. We screened 428,759 compounds in a 
      multiplexed assay using an ATXN2-luciferase reporter in human embryonic kidney 
      293 (HEK-293) cells and identified a diverse set of compounds capable of lowering 
      ATXN2 transcription. We observed dose-dependent reductions of endogenous ATXN2 in 
      HEK-293 cells treated with procillaridin 
      A, 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), and heat shock 
      protein 990 (HSP990), known inhibitors of HSP90 and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPases. 
      Furthermore, HEK-293 cells expressing polyglutamine-expanded ATXN2-Q58 treated 
      with 17-DMAG had minimally detectable ATXN2, as well as normalized markers of 
      autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress, including STAU1 (Staufen 1), 
      molecular target of rapamycin, p62, LC3-II (microtubule-associated protein 
      1A/1B-light chain 3II), CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein), and phospho-eIF2alpha 
      (eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha). Finally, bacterial artificial chromosome 
      ATXN2-Q22 mice treated with 17-DMAG or HSP990 exhibited highly reduced ATXN2 
      protein abundance in the cerebellum. Taken together, our study demonstrates 
      inhibition of HSP90 or Na(+)/K(+)-ATPases as potentially effective therapeutic 
      strategies for treating SCA2 and ALS.

TI  - The Clinical and Polynucleotide Repeat Expansion Analysis of ATXN2, NOP56, AR and

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansions, including those in C9orf72 and ATXN2, have been 
      implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, there have been few 
      studies on the association of AR and NOP56 repeat expansion with ALS, especially 
      in China. Accordingly, we aimed to evaluate the frequency of C9orf72 and ATXN2 
      repeat mutations and investigate whether NOP56 and AR repeat expansion are risk 
      factors for ALS. METHODS: In this study, 736 ALS patients and several hundred 
      healthy controls were recruited. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 
      repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR) were performed to determine the repeat lengths in 
      C9orf72, ATXN2, AR, and NOP56. RESULTS: GGGGCC repeats in C9orf72 were observed 
      in six ALS patients (0.8%, 6/736) but not in any of the controls (0/365). The 
      patients with pathogenic GGGGCC repeats showed shorter median survival times than 
      those with a normal genotype (p = 0.006). Regarding ATXN2 CAG repeats, we 
      identified that intermediate repeat lengths (29-34 copies) were associated with 
      ALS (p = 0.033), and there was no difference in clinical characteristics between 
      the groups with and without intermediate repeats (p > 0.05). Meanwhile, we 
      observed that there was no association between the repeat size in AR and NOP56 
      and ALS (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that pathogenetic 
      repeats in C9orf72 are rare in China, while intermediate CAG repeats in ATXN2 are 
      more frequent but have no effect on disease phenotypes; the repeat size in AR and 
      NOP56 may not be a risk factor for ALS.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a presently incurable neurodegenerative 
      disease. Some genes have a causal relationship to ALS, others act as 
      susceptibility and/or risk factors. We aimed to elucidate the role of 14 
      ALS-related genes in the Hungarian ALS population of 183 patients. Mutation 
      screening of major ALS genes was performed. SMN1 and SMN2 genes were examined by 
      multiplex ligation-dependent probe-amplification assay; intermediate repeat 
      expansions in the ATXN1 and ATXN2 genes were analyzed by fragment analysis. 
      Additional variants in putative ALS genes were screened from previously acquired 
      next generation sequencing data. We confirmed the repeat expansion of the 
      C9orf72, ATXN1 and ATXN2 genes as ALS risk factors in this Hungarian cohort. 
      Additionally, we identified a pathogenic SOD1 mutation and suggested its founder 
      effect. A likely pathogenic variant in the MFSD8 gene was detected, and variants 
      of interest were uncovered in the ANXA11 and GLT8D1 genes. We provide valuable 
      data as part of the growing body of work on population-specific aspects of the 
      genetic background of ALS.

AB  - Intermediate CAG (polyQ) expansions in the gene ataxin-2 (ATXN2) are now 
      recognized as a risk factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The threshold for 
      increased risk is not yet firmly established, with reports ranging from 27 to 31 
      repeats. We investigated the presence of ATXN2 polyQ expansions in 9268 DNA 
      samples collected from people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia, frontotemporal dementia alone, 
      Lewy body dementia and age matched controls. This analysis confirmed ATXN2 
      intermediate polyQ expansions of >/=31 as a risk factor for amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis with an odds ratio of 6.31. Expansions were an even greater risk for 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with frontotemporal dementia (odds ratio 27.59) and 
      a somewhat lesser risk for frontotemporal dementia alone (odds ratio 3.14). There 
      was no increased risk for Lewy body dementia. In a subset of 1362 patients with 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with complete clinical data, we could not confirm 
      previous reports of earlier onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or shorter 
      survival in 25 patients with expansions. These new data confirm >/=31 polyQ repeats 
      in ATXN2 increase the risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and also for the 
      first time show an even greater risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with 
      frontotemporal dementia. The lack of a more aggressive phenotype in amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis patients with expansions has implications for ongoing 
      gene-silencing trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

TI  - Genetic spectrum in a cohort of patients with distal hereditary motor neuropathy.
PG  - 633-643
LID - 10.1002/acn3.51543 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) is a heterogeneous group of 
      diseases characterized by exclusive degeneration of peripheral motor nerves, 
      while only 20.0-47.8% of dHMN patients are genetically identified. Recently, GGC 
      expansion in the 5'UTR of NOTCH2NLC has been associated with dHMN. Accordingly, 
      short tandem repeat (STR) should be further explored in genetically unsolved 
      patients with dHMN. METHODS: A total of 128 patients from 90 unrelated families 
      were clinically diagnosed as dHMN, and underwent a comprehensively genetic 
      screening. Skin biopsies were conducted with routine protocols. RESULTS: Most 
      patients showed chronic distal weakness of lower limbs (121/128), while 20 
      patients initially had asymmetrical involvements, 14 had subclinical sensory 
      abnormalities, 11 had pyramidal impairments, five had cerebellar disturbance, and 
      four had hyperCKmia. The rate of genetic detection was achieved in 36.7% (33/90), 
      and the rate increased to 46.7% (42/90) if patients with variants uncertain 
      significance were included. The most common causative genes included 
      chaperone-related genes (8/33, 24.2%), tRNA synthetase genes (4/33, 12.1%), and 
      cytoskeleton-related genes (4/33, 12.1%). Additionally, two dominant inherited 
      families were attributed to abnormal expansion of GGC repeats in the 5'UTR of 
      NOTCH2NLC; and a patient with dHMN and cerebellar symptoms had CAG repeat 
      expansion in the ATXN2 gene. Skin biopsy from patients with GGC expansion in 
      NOTCH2NLC revealed typical intranuclear inclusions on histological and 
      ultrastructural examinations. INTERPRETATIONS: This study further extends the 
      genetic heterogeneity of dHMN. Given some dHMN patients may be associated with 
      nucleotides repeat expansion, STR screening is necessary to perform in 
      genetically unsolved patients.

LID - 10.1002/acn3.51515 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the evolution of disability in spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCAs) type 1, 2, 3, and 6 (SCA1, 2, 3, 6). METHODS: We analyzed data of 
      two longitudinal cohorts (RISCA, EUROSCA) which recruited ataxic and non-ataxic 
      SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6 mutation carriers. To study disability, we used a 
      five-stage system for ataxia defined by walking ability (stages 0-3) and death 
      (stage 4). Transitions were analyzed using a multi-state model with proportional 
      transition hazards. Based on the hazard estimates, transition probabilities and 
      the expected lengths of stay in each stage were calculated. We further studied 
      the effect of sex and CAG repeat length on progression. RESULTS: Data of 3138 
      visits in 677 participants were analyzed. Median SARA scores for SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, and SCA6 ranged from 1.5 (interquartile range [IQR] = 0.0-3.5) to 3.5 
      (IQR = 1.4-6.1) in stage 0, 11.5 (IQR = 9.6-14.0) to 13.8 (IQR = 11.0-16.0) in 
      stage 1, 19.0 (IQR = 17.0-21.0) to 23.8 (IQR = 19.5-27.0) in stage 2, and 28.5 
      (IQR = 26.0-32.5) to 34.0 (IQR = 32.6-37.1) in stage 3. Modeling allowed to 
      calculate the subtype-specific probability to be in a certain stage at a given 
      age and duration of each stage. CAG repeat length was associated with faster 
      progression in SCA1 (HR, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.1-1.2), SCA2 (1.2, 1.1-1.3), and SCA3 
      (1.1, 1.0-1.2). In SCA6, female sex was associated with faster progression (1.7, 
      1.1-2.6). INTERPRETATION: Our data are important for counselling of patients, 
      assessment of the relevance of outcome markers, and design of clinical trials.

      disorders in the UK: a retrospective diagnostic accuracy and prospective clinical

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansion disorders affect about 1 in 3000 individuals and are 
      clinically heterogeneous diseases caused by expansions of short tandem DNA 
      repeats. Genetic testing is often locus-specific, resulting in underdiagnosis of 
      people who have atypical clinical presentations, especially in paediatric 
      patients without a previous positive family history. Whole genome sequencing is 
      increasingly used as a first-line test for other rare genetic disorders, and we 
      aimed to assess its performance in the diagnosis of patients with neurological 
      repeat expansion disorders. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic 
      accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect the most common repeat expansion 
      loci associated with neurological outcomes (AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, 
      C9orf72, CACNA1A, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, and TBP) using samples obtained within 
      the National Health Service in England from patients who were suspected of having 
      neurological disorders; previous PCR test results were used as the reference 
      standard. The clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat 
      expansions was prospectively examined in previously genetically tested and 
      undiagnosed patients recruited in 2013-17 to the 100 000 Genomes Project in the 
      UK, who were suspected of having a genetic neurological disorder (familial or 
      early-onset forms of ataxia, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, dementia, motor 
      neuron disease, parkinsonian movement disorders, intellectual disability, or 
      neuromuscular disorders). If a repeat expansion call was made using whole genome 
      sequencing, PCR was used to confirm the result. FINDINGS: The diagnostic accuracy 
      of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat expansions was evaluated against 793 
      PCR tests previously performed within the NHS from 404 patients. Whole genome 
      sequencing correctly classified 215 of 221 expanded alleles and 1316 of 1321 
      non-expanded alleles, showing 97.3% sensitivity (95% CI 94.2-99.0) and 99.6% 
      specificity (99.1-99.9) across the 13 disease-associated loci when compared with 
      PCR test results. In samples from 11 631 patients in the 100 000 Genomes Project, 
      whole genome sequencing identified 81 repeat expansions, which were also tested 
      by PCR: 68 were confirmed as repeat expansions in the full pathogenic range, 11 
      were non-pathogenic intermediate expansions or premutations, and two were 
      non-expanded repeats (16% false discovery rate). INTERPRETATION: In our study, 
      whole genome sequencing for the detection of repeat expansions showed high 
      sensitivity and specificity, and it led to identification of neurological repeat 
      expansion disorders in previously undiagnosed patients. These findings support 
      implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical laboratories for diagnosis 
      of patients who have a neurological presentation consistent with a repeat 
      expansion disorder. FUNDING: Medical Research Council, Department of Health and

TI  - Genetic Distribution of Five Spinocerebellar Ataxia Microsatellite Loci in 
      Mexican Native American Populations and Its Impact on Contemporary Mestizo 
      Populations.

LID - 157
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) conform a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders with autosomal dominant inheritance. Five of the most frequent SCAs are 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the exons of specific genes. The SCAs 
      incidence and the distribution of polymorphic CAG alleles vary among populations 
      and ethnicities. Thus, characterization of the genetic architecture of ethnically 
      diverse populations, which have undergone recent admixture and demographic 
      events, could facilitate the identification of genetic risk factors. Owing to the 
      great ethnic diversity of the Mexican population, this study aimed to analyze the 
      allele frequencies of five SCA microsatellite loci (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and 
      SCA7) in eleven Mexican Native American (MNA) populations. Data from the 
      literature were used to compare the allelic distribution of SCA loci with 
      worldwide populations. The SCA loci allelic frequencies evidenced a certain 
      genetic homogeneity in the MNA populations, except for Mayans, who exhibited 
      distinctive genetic profiles. Neither pathological nor large normal alleles were 
      found in MNA populations, except for the SCA2 pre-mutated allele in the Zapotec 
      population. Collectively, our findings demonstrated the contribution of the MNA 
      ancestry in shaping the genetic structure of contemporary Mexican Mestizo 
      populations. Our results also suggest that Native American ancestry has no impact 
      on the origin of SCAs in the Mexican population. Instead, the acquisition of 
      pathological SCA alleles could be associated with European migration.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is one of the most common 
      autosomal dominant ataxias in the world. Several reports revealed that CAG 
      repeats in some polyQ-containing genes may affect the age at onset (AAO) of 
      patients with SCA2, however, little studies were conducted among Chinese patients 
      with SCA2. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of CAG repeats 
      on the AAO of patients with SCA2 in China. METHODS: A total of 119 patients with 
      SCA2 were enrolled and were divided into 2 groups according to their major 
      phenotype: 17 patients from 9 families with Parkinson's syndrome were grouped as 
      the Parkinson's disease-SCA2 (PD-SAC2); 91 patients from 66 SCA2 families and 11 
      sporadic SCA2 patients were grouped as the ataxia-SCA2 (A-SCA2). Blood samples 
      were obtained from the subjects, and the CAG repeat length in ATXN2 and other 
      (CAG)(n)-containing genes was screened using fluorescent PCR. The Spearman's rank 
      correlation between the CAG repeat length in (CAG)(n)-containing genes and AAO 
      was analyzed. Regression analysis was performed to investigate whether the CAG 
      repeat length could explain the variant of AAO. A t-test was used to compare the 
      difference of CAG repeat length in (CAG)(n)-containing genes between the PD-SAC2 
      and A-SCA2 groups. RESULTS: The CAG repeat length in the longer allele of ATXN2 
      was negatively correlated with AAO of SCA2 (R=-0.251, P<0.05), and the CAG repeat 
      length could explain 41.7% of the variation of AAO. AAO negatively correlated 
      with the CAG repeat length in the shorter allele of ATXN7 (R=-0.251, P=0.006) or 
      in the longer allele of TBP gene (R=-0.197, P=0.034). A tendency of delay in the 
      AAO was also observed in patients with SCA2 carrying the CAG repeat within the 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, and RAI1. In addition, we found that the CAG repeat 
      length in ATXN7 and ATXN2 between the A-SCA2 and the PD-SCA2 groups was 
      significantly different (both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The CAG repeat in ATXN2 is a 
      major genetic factor for the AAO of patients with SCA2 in China. The CAG repeat 
      length in ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, and RAI1 genes might be a potential factor 
      associated with the AAO of SCA2. The CAG repeat in ATXN7 might be a potential 
      factor affecting the Parkinson's syndrome in SCA2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-ataxic manifestations in autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias 
      are variable and influenced by CAG repeat length and age at onset. This report 
      describes a genetically proven SCA2 kindred with an atypical phenotype resembling 
      SCA3. CASE REPORT: The phenotype of five genetically proven patients with SCA2 in 
      this report differed from the typical phenotype owing to persistence of reflexes 
      late into the course of illness, absence of peripheral neuropathy, and very 
      prominent facial twitches. DISCUSSION: Despite descriptions of typical phenotypes 
      of SCA, significant variations occur, especially within kindreds. Caution should 
      be exercised in clinical diagnoses of SCA, especially with atypical features.

TI  - RNA Toxicity and Perturbation of rRNA Processing in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 
      2.
PG  - 2519-2529

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in Ataxin-2 (ATXN2) gene. The mutant ATXN2 
      protein with a polyglutamine tract is known to be toxic and contributes to the 
      SCA2 pathogenesis. OBJECTIVE: Here, we tested the hypothesis that the mutant 
      ATXN2 transcript with an expanded CAG repeat (expATXN2) is also toxic and 
      contributes to SCA2 pathogenesis. METHODS: The toxic effect of expATXN2 
      transcripts on SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells and primary mouse cortical neurons was 
      evaluated by caspase 3/7 activity and nuclear condensation assay, respectively. 
      RNA immunoprecipitation assay was performed to identify RNA binding proteins 
      (RBPs) that bind to expATXN2 RNA. Quantitative PCR was used to examine if 
      ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing is disrupted in SCA2 and Huntington's disease 
      (HD) human brain tissue. RESULTS: expATXN2 RNA induces neuronal cell death, and 
      aberrantly interacts with RBPs involved in RNA metabolism. One of the RBPs, 
      transducin beta-like protein 3 (TBL3), involved in rRNA processing, binds to both 
      expATXN2 and expanded huntingtin (expHTT) RNA in vitro. rRNA processing is 
      disrupted in both SCA2 and HD human brain tissue. CONCLUSION: These findings 
      provide the first evidence of a contributory role of expATXN2 transcripts in SCA2 
      pathogenesis, and further support the role of expHTT transcripts in HD 
      pathogenesis. The disruption of rRNA processing, mediated by aberrant interaction 
      of RBPs with expATXN2 and expHTT transcripts, suggest a point of convergence in 
      the pathogeneses of repeat expansion diseases with potential therapeutic 
      implications. (c) 2021 The Authors. Movement Disorders published by Wiley

AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening for short tandem repeat (STR) expansions in next-generation 
      sequencing data can enable diagnosis, optimal clinical management/treatment, and 
      accurate genetic counseling of patients with repeat expansion disorders. We aimed 
      to develop an efficient computational workflow for reliable detection of STR 
      expansions in next-generation sequencing data and demonstrate its clinical 
      utility. METHODS: We characterized the performance of eight STR analysis methods 
      (lobSTR, HipSTR, RepeatSeq, ExpansionHunter, TREDPARSE, GangSTR, STRetch, and 
      exSTRa) on next-generation sequencing datasets of samples with known 
      disease-causing full-mutation STR expansions and genomes simulated to harbor 
      repeat expansions at selected loci and optimized their sensitivity. We then used 
      a machine learning decision tree classifier to identify an optimal combination of 
      methods for full-mutation detection. In Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)-aligned 
      genomes, the ensemble approach of using ExpansionHunter, STRetch, and exSTRa 
      performed the best (precision = 82%, recall = 100%, F1-score = 90%). We applied 
      this pipeline to screen 301 families of children with suspected genetic 
      disorders. RESULTS: We identified 10 individuals with full-mutations in the AR, 
      ATXN1, ATXN8, DMPK, FXN, or HTT disease STR locus in the analyzed families. 
      Additional candidates identified in our analysis include two probands with 
      borderline ATXN2 expansions between the established repeat size range for 
      reduced-penetrance and full-penetrance full-mutation and seven individuals with 
      FMR1 CGG repeats in the intermediate/premutation repeat size range. In 67 
      probands with a prior negative clinical PCR test for the FMR1, FXN, or DMPK 
      disease STR locus, or the spinocerebellar ataxia disease STR panel, our pipeline 
      did not falsely identify aberrant expansion. We performed clinical PCR tests on 
      seven (out of 10) full-mutation samples identified by our pipeline and confirmed 
      the expansion status in all, showing absolute concordance between our 
      bioinformatics and molecular findings. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully 
      demonstrated the application of a well-optimized bioinformatics pipeline that 
      promotes the utility of genome-wide sequencing as a first-tier screening test to 
      detect expansions of known disease STRs. Interrogating clinical next-generation 
      sequencing data for pathogenic STR expansions using our ensemble pipeline can 
      improve diagnostic yield and enhance clinical outcomes for patients with repeat 
      expansion disorders.

AB  - Polyglutamine repeat expansions in the Ataxin-2 (ATXN2) gene were first 
      implicated in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2, a disease associated with 
      degeneration of motor neurons and Purkinje cells. Recent studies linked single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene to elevated intraocular pressure in primary 
      open angle glaucoma (POAG); yet, the localization of ATXN2 across 
      glaucoma-relevant tissues of the vertebrate eye has not been thoroughly examined. 
      This study characterizes ATXN2 expression in the mouse and human retina, and 
      anterior eye, using an antibody validated in ATXN2(-/-) retinas. ATXN2-ir was 
      localized to cytosolic sub compartments in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) somata and 
      proximal dendrites in addition to GABAergic, glycinergic, and cholinergic 
      amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and displaced amacrine cells. 
      Human, but not mouse retinas showed modest immunolabeling of bipolar cells. ATXN2 
      immunofluorescence was prominent in the trabecular meshwork and pigmented and 
      nonpigmented cells of the ciliary body, with analyses of primary human trabecular 
      meshwork cells confirming the finding. The expression of ATXN2 in key 
      POAG-relevant ocular tissues supports the potential role in autophagy and stress 
      granule formation in response to ocular hypertension.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia-2 is one of the most prevalent SCA type across 
      the world and one of the commonest in India. We aimed to characterize SCA2 
      patients both clinically and genetically (ATXN2-CAG repeats and its haplotypic 
      background). METHODS: A total of 436 SCA2 patients were recruited consecutively 
      comprising individuals of multiple ethnicities and two large multigenerational 
      families. A detailed clinical evaluation and genetic analysis for CAG repeat 
      length estimation and two marker based haplotype analysis [rs695871 and rs695872 
      located 177 bp and 106 bp upstream of CAG sequence in Exon 1 of ATXN2] was 
      performed. RESULTS: Generalized limb ataxia and slow saccades were prevalent 
      features in majority of our patients, while hyporeflexia and extrapyramidal 
      features were less commonly observed manifestations. Slow ocular saccades, upper 
      limb ataxia and tremor showed significant associations with age of onset, CAG 
      repeat length and disease duration. We observed a 100% association of C-C 
      haplotype with the expanded ATXN2 repeats. CONCLUSION: This study represents the 
      largest study of SCA2 Indian patients that highlights the clinico-genetic 
      manifestations and haplotype analysis. A significant proportion of patients have 
      not shown the characteristic slow saccades and hyporeflexia thus indicating the 
      influences of other factors in modulation of the disease which warrants further 
      investigations. The observation of CC haplotype in all our SCA2 patients 
      indicates a common origin across all Indian sub populations and that also 
      indicate a common global founder event in the past.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hereditary ataxias demonstrate a high degree of clinical and 
      genetic heterogeneity. Understanding the genetic etiology of hereditary ataxias 
      is crucial for genetic counseling and clinical management. METHODS: The clinical 
      and genetic data of patients with familial or sporadic ataxias who referred to 
      our tertiary medical center were retrospectively analyzed. Probands in this study 
      underwent SCA repeat expansion panel firstly to screen for repeat expansion SCAs; 
      those with negative results had NGS-targeted panels or WES testing to detect 
      conventional mutations. RESULTS: A total of 223 patients were enrolled from 206 
      families. 5 kinds of coexisting SCA repeat expansions were observed (SCA3/SCA17, 
      SCA3/SCA8, SCA2/SCA8, SCA3/SCA12 and SCA8/SCA12) in 12 patients from 8 families, 
      among which SCA2/SCA8, SCA8/SCA12 and SCA3/SCA12 were reported for the first 
      time. The coexistence of expanded SCA3 with SCA17 alleles was the most common in 
      our study. NGS identified pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 12 ataxia 
      causative genes in 13 probands. Spastic paraplegia ataxia was the most common 
      diagnosis. Six novel mutations were detected in five ataxia-related genes. 
      CONCLUSION: Coexistence may not specific to a certain SCA subtype and the 
      frequency might have been underestimated before. SCA repeat expansion panel 
      should be considered in patients with overlapping SCA features. In addition, our 
      study broadened the conventional mutation spectrum in ataxia-related genes. These 
      results facilitate a better understanding of the genetic basis for hereditary 
      ataxias.

TI  - Repeats expansions in ATXN2, NOP56, NIPA1 and ATXN1 are not associated with ALS 
      in Africans.
PG  - 130-135

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized primarily by progressive loss of motor neurons. Although ALS occurs 
      worldwide and the frequency and spectrum of identifiable genetic causes of 
      disease varies across populations, very few studies have included African 
      subjects. In addition to a hexanucleotide repeat expansion (RE) in C9orf72, the 
      most common genetic cause of ALS in Europeans, REs in ATXN2, NIPA1 and ATXN1 have 
      shown variable associations with ALS in Europeans. Intermediate range expansions 
      in some of these genes (e.g. ATXN2) have been reported as potential risk factors, 
      or phenotypic modifiers, of ALS. Pathogenic expansions in NOP56 cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-36, which can present with prominent motor neuron 
      degeneration. Here we compare REs in these genes in a cohort of Africans with ALS 
      and population controls using whole genome sequencing data. Targeting genotyping 
      of short tandem repeats at known loci within ATXN2, NIPA1, ATXN1 and NOP56 was 
      performed using ExpansionHunter software in 105 Southern African (SA) patients 
      with ALS. African population controls were from an in-house SA population control 
      database (n = 25), the SA Human Genome Program (n = 24), the Simons Genome 
      Diversity Project (n = 39) and the Illumina Polaris Diversity Cohort (IPDC) 
      dataset (n = 50). We found intermediate RE alleles in ATXN2 (27-33 repeats) and 
      ATXN1 (33-35 repeats), and NIPA1 long alleles (>/=8 repeats) were rare in Africans, 
      and not associated with ALS (p > 0.17). NOP56 showed no expanded alleles in 
      either ALS or controls. We also compared the differences in allele distributions 
      between the African and n = 50 European controls (from the IPDC). There was a 
      statistical significant difference in the distribution of the REs in the ATXN1 
      between African and European controls (Chi-test p < 0.001), and NIPA1 showed 
      proportionately more longer alleles (RE > 8) in Europeans vs. Africans (Fisher's 
      p = 0.016). The distribution of RE alleles in ATXN2 and NOP56 were similar 
      amongst African and European controls. In conclusion, repeat expansions in ATXN2, 
      NIPA1 and ATXN1, which showed associations with ALS in Europeans, were not 
      replicated in Southern Africans with ALS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cerebellar disease burden and cerebro-cerebellar connectivity 
      alterations are poorly characterised in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 
      despite the likely contribution of cerebellar pathology to the clinical 
      heterogeneity of the condition. METHODS: A prospective imaging study has been 
      undertaken with 271 participants to systematically evaluate cerebellar grey and 
      white matter alterations, cerebellar peduncle integrity and cerebro-cerebellar 
      connectivity in ALS. Participants were stratified into four groups: (1) patients 
      testing positive for GGGGCC repeat expansions in C9orf72, (2) patients carrying 
      an intermediate-length repeat expansion in ATXN2, (3) patients without 
      established ALS-associated mutations and (4) healthy controls. Additionally, the 
      cerebellar profile of a single patient with ALS who had an ATXN2 allele length of 
      62 was evaluated. Cortical thickness, grey matter and white matter volumes were 
      calculated in each cerebellar lobule complemented by morphometric analyses to 
      characterise genotype-associated atrophy patterns. A Bayesian segmentation 
      algorithm was used for superior cerebellar peduncle volumetry. White matter 
      diffusivity parameters were appraised both within the cerebellum and in the 
      cerebellar peduncles. Cerebro-cerebellar connectivity was assessed using 
      deterministic tractography. RESULTS: Cerebellar pathology was confined to lobules 
      I-V of the anterior lobe in patients with sporadic ALS in contrast to the 
      considerable posterior lobe and vermis disease burden identified in C9orf72 
      mutation carriers. Patients with intermediate ATXN2 expansions did not exhibit 
      significant cerebellar pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Focal rather than global 
      cerebellar degeneration characterises ALS. Pathognomonic ALS symptoms which are 
      typically attributed to other anatomical regions, such as dysarthria, dysphagia, 
      pseudobulbar affect, eye movement abnormalities and cognitive deficits, may be 
      modulated, exacerbated or partially driven by cerebellar changes in ALS.

TI  - Molecular spectrum, family screening and genetic counselling of Spinocerebellar 
      Ataxia (SCA) cases in an Indian scenario.
PG  - 370-380
LID - 10.1080/01677063.2021.1940172 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA) is a heterogeneous adult-onset disorder with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance pattern mainly caused by triplet repeat 
      expansions. Clinical diagnosis of SCA is based on phenotypic features followed by 
      confirmation through molecular diagnosis. To identify status of repeat range in 
      Indian SCA cases and provide extended family screening, we enrolled 70 clinical 
      SCA suspects. For molecular diagnosis, multiplex PCR (M-PCR) was used for common 
      Indian SCA subtypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12 and 17. TP-PCR was further used in 
      SCA2, 7 and 10 to identify larger expansions. Eighteen out of 70 SCA suspects 
      (25%) were found to be positive for various SCA subtypes- (5 SCA1 (28%), 6 SAC2 
      (34%), 2 SCA3 (12%), 3 SCA7 (16%) and one each for SCA6 (1%) and SCA17 (1%) 
      subtypes). Genetic counselling and extended family screening were offered to all 
      positive cases and yielded additional nine cases. We have established M-PCR and 
      TP-PCR to detect the CAG repeat expansion in SCA suspects. This method can 
      confirm SCA subtypes in a reliable, rapid and cost-effective way. Genetic 
      characterization of SCA-related genes has great clinical relevance, as it could 
      provide additional information and guidance to clinicians and family members 
      regarding prognosis.

TI  - Toxicity of pathogenic ataxin-2 in Drosophila shows dependence on a pure CAG 
      repeat sequence.
PG  - 1797-1810
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddab148 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 is a polyglutamine (polyQ) disease associated with 
      an expanded polyQ domain within the protein product of the ATXN2 gene. 
      Interestingly, polyQ repeat expansions in ATXN2 are also associated with 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and parkinsonism depending upon the length of 
      the polyQ repeat expansion. The sequence encoding the polyQ repeat also varies 
      with disease presentation: a pure CAG repeat is associated with SCA2, whereas the 
      CAG repeat in ALS and parkinsonism is typically interrupted with the glutamine 
      encoding CAA codon. Here, we asked if the purity of the CAG sequence encoding the 
      polyQ repeat in ATXN2 could impact the toxicity of the ataxin-2 protein in vivo 
      in Drosophila. We found that ataxin-2 encoded by a pure CAG repeat conferred 
      toxicity in the retina and nervous system, whereas ataxin-2 encoded by a 
      CAA-interrupted repeat or CAA-only repeat failed to confer toxicity, despite 
      expression of the protein at similar levels. Furthermore, the CAG-encoded 
      ataxin-2 protein aggregated in the fly eye, while ataxin-2 encoded by either a 
      CAA/G or CAA repeat remained diffuse. The toxicity of the CAG-encoded ataxin-2 
      protein was also sensitive to the translation factor eIF4H, a known modifier of 
      the toxic GGGGCC repeat in flies. These data indicate that ataxin-2 encoded by a 
      pure CAG versus interrupted CAA/G polyQ repeat domain is associated with 
      differential toxicity, indicating that mechanisms associated with the purity of 
      the sequence of the polyQ domain contribute to disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative disease 
      presenting with redox imbalance. However, the nature and implications of redox 
      imbalance in SCA2 physiopathology have not been fully understood. OBJECTIVE: The 
      objective of this study is to assess the redox imbalance and its association with 
      disease severity in SCA2 mutation carriers. METHODS: A case-control study was 
      conducted involving molecularly confirmed SCA2 patients, presymptomatic 
      individuals, and healthy controls. Several antioxidant parameters were assessed, 
      including serum thiol concentration and the superoxide dismutase, catalase, and 
      glutathione S-transferase enzymatic activities. Also, several prooxidant 
      parameters were evaluated, including thiobarbituric acid-reactive species and 
      protein carbonyl concentrations. Damage, protective, and OXY scores were 
      computed. Clinical correlates were established. RESULTS: Significant differences 
      were found between comparison groups for redox markers, including protein 
      carbonyl concentration (F = 3.30; p = 0.041), glutathione S-transferase activity 
      (F = 4.88; p = 0.009), and damage (F = 3.20; p = 0.045), protection (F = 12.75; p 
      < 0.001), and OXY (F = 7.29; p = 0.001) scores. Protein carbonyl concentration 
      was positively correlated with CAG repeat length (r = 0.27; p = 0.022), while 
      both protein carbonyl concentration (r = -0.27; p = 0.018) and OXY score (r = 
      -0.25; p = 0.013) were inversely correlated to the disease duration. Increasing 
      levels of antioxidants and decreasing levels of prooxidant parameters were 
      associated with clinical worsening. CONCLUSIONS: There is a disruption of redox 
      balance in SCA2 mutation carriers which depends on the disease stage. Besides, 
      redox changes associate with markers of disease severity, suggesting a link 
      between disruption of redox balance and SCA2 physiopathology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We intended to clarify the phenotypic and molecular diversities of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) in Japan. METHODS: DNA was extracted from 
      the peripheral blood of 436 patients, including 126 patients with chronic 
      neuropathy, 108 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and 202 with cerebellar 
      ataxia. We then PCR-amplified and sequenced the ATXN2 gene. The biopsied sural 
      nerves of mutation-positive patients were subjected to light-microscopic and 
      electron-microscopic analyses. Transfection analyses were performed using a 
      Schwann cell line, IMS32. RESULTS: We found PCR-amplified products potentially 
      corresponding to expanded CAG repeats in four patients. Two patients in the 
      chronic neuropathy group had a full repeat expansion or an intermediate expansion 
      (39 or 32 repeats), without limb ataxia. The sural nerve biopsy findings of the 
      two patients included axonal neuropathy and mixed neuropathy (axonal changes with 
      demyelination). Schwann cells harbored either cytoplasmic or nuclear inclusions 
      on electron microscopic examination. Both patients recently exhibited pyramidal 
      signs. In the third patient in the cerebellar ataxia group, we identified a novel 
      21-base duplication mutation near 22 CAG repeats (c.432_452dup). The transfection 
      study revealed that the 21-base-duplication mutant Ataxin-2 proteins aggregated 
      in IMS32 and rendered cells susceptible to oxidative stress, similar to a 
      CAG-expanded mutant. The fourth patient, with 41 repeats, had ataxia and 
      spasticity. The two patients with cerebellar ataxia also had peripheral 
      neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with expanded CAG repeats can exhibit a 
      neuropathy-dominant phenotype not described previously. The novel 
      21-base-duplication mutant seems to share the aggregation properties of 
      polyglutamine-expanded mutants.

      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2 Patients.
PG  - 1372-1380
LID - 10.1002/mds.28498 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 is a progressive neurodegenerative 
      disorder due to an unstable expansion of a CAG repeat in the ATXN2 gene. Although 
      weight loss has been associated with disease progression in several 
      neurodegenerative conditions, it has been barely assessed in patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test 
      whether body mass index is altered in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      with varying expansion sizes from early to late disease stages. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional case-control study was performed, which included 222 clinically 
      and molecularly diagnosed patients and 214 sex- and age-matched healthy 
      individuals. ATXN2 genotypes and sex were considered as risk factors. Clinical 
      outcomes included the body mass index, age at onset, disease duration, Scale for 
      the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia score, disease stage, dysphagia, and 
      progression rate. Multiple linear regression models were generated. RESULTS: Body 
      mass index was significantly decreased in male patients, but not in female 
      patients, relative to control subjects. In addition to sex, body mass index was 
      significantly associated with age at onset and progression rate. Conversely, body 
      mass index, along with repeat length in ATXN2 expanded alleles and disease 
      duration, was associated with Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia 
      score. In addition, body mass index, along with the age at onset and the repeat 
      length in ATXN2 normal and expanded alleles, has a significant influence on 
      progression rate. CONCLUSIONS: Body mass index might be a useful biomarker of 
      disease severity, particularly in male patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      2 in the context of nutritional interventions or clinical trials assessing the 
      efficacy of promising new drugs. (c) 2021 International Parkinson and Movement

AB  - PURPOSE: Investigate single nucleotide variants and short tandem repeats in 39 
      genes related to spinocerebellar ataxia in clinical and pathologically defined 
      cohorts of multiple system atrophy. METHODS: Exome sequencing was conducted in 28 
      clinical multiple system atrophy patients to identify single nucleotide variants 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes. Novel variants were validated in two 
      independent disease cohorts: 86 clinically diagnosed multiple system atrophy 
      patients and 166 pathological multiple system atrophy cases. Expanded repeat 
      alleles in spinocerebellar ataxia genes were evaluated in 36 clinically diagnosed 
      multiple system atrophy patients, and CAG/CAA repeats in TATA-Box Binding Protein 
      (TBP, causative of SCA17) were screened in 216 clinical and pathological multiple 
      system atrophy patients and 346 controls. RESULTS: No known pathogenic 
      spinocerebellar ataxia single nucleotide variants or pathogenic range expanded 
      repeat alleles of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, AXTN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, 
      and TBP were detected in any clinical multiple system atrophy patients. However, 
      four novel variants were identified in four spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes 
      across three multiple system atrophy patients. Additionally, four multiple system 
      atrophy patients (1.6%) and one control (0.3%) carried an intermediate length 41 
      TBP CAG/CAA repeat allele (OR = 4.11, P = 0.21). There was a significant 
      association between the occurrence of a repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) and an increased risk of multiple system atrophy (OR = 1.64, P = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: Occurrence of TBP CAG/CAA repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) is significantly associated with increased multiple system atrophy risk. 
      This discovery warrants further investigation and supports a possible genetic 
      overlap of multiple system atrophy with SCA17.

TI  - Genetic analysis of ALS cases in the isolated island population of Malta.
PG  - 604-614
LID - 10.1038/s41431-020-00767-9 [doi]
AB  - Genetic isolates are compelling tools for mapping genes of inherited disorders. 
      The archipelago of Malta, a sovereign microstate in the south of Europe is home 
      to a geographically and culturally isolated population. Here, we investigate the 
      epidemiology and genetic profile of Maltese patients with amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS), identified throughout a 2-year window. Cases were largely male 
      (66.7%) with a predominant spinal onset of symptoms (70.8%). Disease onset 
      occurred around mid-age (median age: 64 years, men; 59.5 years, female); 12.5% 
      had familial ALS (fALS). Annual incidence rate was 2.48 (95% CI 1.59-3.68) per 
      100,000 person-years. Male-to-female incidence ratio was 1.93:1. Prevalence was 
      3.44 (95% CI 2.01-5.52) cases per 100,000 inhabitants on 31(st) December 2018. 
      Whole-genome sequencing allowed us to determine rare DNA variants that change the 
      protein-coding sequence of ALS-associated genes. Interestingly, the Maltese ALS 
      patient cohort was found to be negative for deleterious variants in C9orf72, 
      SOD1, TARDBP or FUS genes, which are the most commonly mutated ALS genes 
      globally. Nonetheless, ALS-associated repeat expansions were identified in ATXN2 
      and NIPA1. Variants predicted to be damaging were also detected in ALS2, DAO, 
      DCTN1, ERBB4, SETX, SCFD1 and SPG11. A total of 40% of patients with sporadic ALS 
      had a rare and deleterious variant or repeat expansion in an ALS-associated gene, 
      whilst the genetic cause of two thirds of fALS cases could not be pinpointed to 
      known ALS genes or risk loci. This warrants further studies to elucidate novel 
      genes that cause ALS in this unique population isolate.

TI  - Investigating TBP CAG/CAA trinucleotide repeat expansions in a Taiwanese cohort 
      with ALS.
PG  - 442-447
LID - 10.1080/21678421.2020.1867182 [doi]
AB  - Intermediate-length CAG repeats in ATXN2 have been well recognized as a genetic 
      risk factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the role of similar 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions in the TATA-box binding protein gene (TBP), 
      another disease-associated gene for inherited ataxia, in ALS remains elusive. To 
      assess the association between TBP trinucleotide repeat expansions and ALS, we 
      investigated the repeat lengths in 325 unrelated ALS patients and 1500 controls 
      in the Taiwanese population. The most common size of repeats in the patients and 
      controls were both 36. The repeat lengths ranged from 29 to 46 repeats in the ALS 
      patients and 27 to 43 repeats in the controls. Two ALS patients carried a TBP 
      allele with a repeat number equal or greater than 44 (44 and 46). The patient 
      with the 46 trinucleotide repeats also had a C9ORF72 GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat 
      expansion. The odds ratio of an individual carrying the CAG/CAA repeats >/= 44 to 
      have ALS is 23.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.11-484.24; p = 0.04). Our findings 
      suggest that intermediate-length CAG/CAA repeat expansions in TBP may associate 
      with ALS risk.

      share a common molecular basis: both are associated with CAG-repeat expansion of 
      ATXN2 and TDP-43-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions. To date, the two 
      disorders are viewed as clinically distinct with ALS resulting from 30-33 
      CAG-repeats and SCA2 from >34 CAG-repeats. We describe a 67-year old with a 32 
      CAG-repeat expansion of ATXN2 who presented with simultaneous symptoms of ALS and 
      SCA2. Our case demonstrates that the clinical dichotomy between SCA2 and 
      ATXN2-ALS is false. We suggest instead that CAG-repeat expansion length 
      determines the timing of SCA2 clinical symptoms relative to onset of ALS; 
      consistent with this age of onset of SCA2 but not ATXN2-ALS, is dependent upon 
      expansion length. Review of the literature and our local cohort provides evidence 
      for occurrence of ALS in late stage SCA2, which may be under-recognised by 
      clinicians who think of the two diseases as distinct.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3 and Huntington disease are 
      neurodegenerative disorders caused by expanded CAG repeats. METHODS: We performed 
      an in-silico analysis of CAG repeats in ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, and HTT using 30x 
      whole-=genome sequencing data of 2504 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. 
      RESULTS: Seven HTT-positive, 3 ATXN2-positive, 1 ATXN3-positive, and 6 possibly 
      ATXN1-positive samples were identified. No correlation was found between the 
      repeat sizes of the different genes. The distribution of CAG alleles varied by 
      ethnicity. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that there may be asymptomatic small 
      expanded repeats in almost 0.5% of these populations. (c) 2020 International

AB  - TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) is a major component of intracellular 
      aggregates formed in brains of the patients with frontotemporal lobar 
      degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which are 
      correctively referred to as TDP-43 proteinopathies. A link between Ataxin-2 
      (ATXN2) and TDP-43 proteinopathies was established when intermediate CAG repeat 
      expansions of ATXN2 gene were found to be associated with ALS and it was shown 
      that ATXN2 modifies TDP-43 toxicity. Although ATXN2's contribution to TDP-43 
      proteinopathies has been mostly studied in ALS, recent studies have shown that 
      intermediate repeat expansions of ATXN2 also influence the phenotype of FTLD by 
      an unknown mechanism. To address this issue, we immunohistochemically and 
      biochemically analyzed the intracellular dynamics of ATXN2 in brains of normal 
      controls and FTLD-TDP cases. The immunohistochemical studies revealed that ATXN2 
      localized in the neuronal cytoplasm and proximal dendrites, and expressed widely 
      and uniformly in normal human brains. A semi-quantitative immunofluorescent 
      analysis of normal brains revealed that the cytoplasmic ATXN2 strongly associates 
      with ribosomal protein S6 and poly-A binding protein 1 and partially overlaps 
      with the endoplasmic reticulum marker Calnexin, suggesting a major role of ATXN2 
      in protein synthesis. The results of immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses 
      of brains from FTLD-TDP cases showed the colocalization of ATXN2 and 
      phosphorylated TDP-43 in the dystrophic neurites and the neuronal cytoplasmic 
      inclusions in the hippocampal region, and a significant reduction of ATXN2 
      protein compared to controls. These results suggest that ATXN2 is involved in the 
      pathological process of FTLD-TDP. It remains to be clarified whether reduced 
      ATXN2 expression induces neurodegeneration by impairing protein synthesis or 
      plays a neuroprotective role by attenuating the toxicity of TDP-43 aggregates in 
      FTLD-TDP and other TDP-43 proteinopathies.

TI  - Genetic profile and clinical characteristics of Chinese patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2: A multicenter experience over 10 years.
PG  - 955-964
LID - 10.1111/ene.14601 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is the second most 
      common type of spinocerebellar ataxia in China. However, data on the clinical and 
      genetic features of Chinese SCA2 patients are scarce. This study aims to provide 
      a comprehensive description of in the Chinese SCA2 cohort. METHODS: A total of 
      135 patients with SCA2 from 92 families and 104 unrelated normal controls were 
      recruited from three medical centers between 2008 and 2020. Sanger sequencing and 
      TA cloning were used to determine the CAG repeat length and intrinsic structure. 
      The clinical data of patients with SCA2, including electromyography, magnetic 
      resonance imaging, positron-emission tomography, and clinical scale scores, were 
      recorded. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD age at onset of SCA2 patients was 
      32.6 +/- 11.9 years and the corresponding CAG repeat length was 42.1 +/- 3.6. CAG 
      repeat length accounted for 64% of the age-at-onset variance. We observed that 
      patients had a significantly lower proportion of (CAG)(8) CAA(CAG)(4) CAA(CAG)(8) 
      within normal alleles than normal controls (48.8% vs. 64.9%; p = 0.003), while 
      the distribution of the proportion of (CAG)(13) CAA (CAG)(8) was the opposite. 
      Peripheral neuropathy was frequent, occurring in 75.9% of the patients. 
      Parkinsonism was relatively common, with a frequency of 11.8%. Two patients with 
      parkinsonism had a significantly more severe reduction in dopamine transporter 
      levels in the bilateral striatum than the one patient with pure ataxia. An 
      infant-onset case of SCA2 with more than 180 CAG repeats was characterized by 
      global development delay, hypotonia and hearing impairment. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study describes the genetic profile and clinical characteristics of the largest 
      SCA2 cohort to date in the Chinese population and analyzes inter-population 
      differences. Many aspects of this study population were different from other 
      populations with SCA2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ataxin-2 (ATXN2) gene contains a cytosine-adenine-guanine repeat 
      sequence ranging from 13 to 31 repeats, but when surpassing certain thresholds 
      causes neurodegeneration. Genetic alterations in ATXN2 other than pathological 
      cytosine adenine guanine (CAG) repeats are unknown. METHODS/RESULTS: We have 
      identified a 9-base pair duplication in the 2-gene ATXN2 sense/antisense region. 
      The duplication was found in a Swedish family with spinocerebellar ataxia 3 with 
      parkinsonism, conferring a deviated age at onset unexplained by the concomitant 
      presence of ATXN2 intermediate alleles. Similarly, C9ORF72 amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis cases bearing the same duplication had earlier age at onset than those 
      with C9ORF72 and ATXN2 intermediate alleles. No effect was evident in Parkinson's 
      disease (PD) cases without known PD gene mutations. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the 
      first genetic alteration other than the known intermediate-range CAG repeats in 
      ATXN2. This 9-base pair duplication may act as an additional hit among carriers 
      of pathological nucleotide expansions in ATXN3 and C9ORF72 with ATXN2 
      intermediate. (c) 2020 The Authors. Movement Disorders published by Wiley

AB  - OBJECTIVE: White matter (WM) integrity of Spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) is 
      poorly understood, more so in the early stages of SCA2. In this study, we 
      evaluated the microstructural integrity of the WM tracts with an emphasis on the 
      nature of in vivo pathological involvement in early SCA2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      We evaluated the MRI images of 26 genetically proven SCA2 patients with disease 
      duration <5 years and 24 age- and gender-matched healthy controls using 
      tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to identify the WM tract changes and their 
      clinico-genetic correlates (age at onset, duration of disease, ataxia severity 
      and CAG repeat length) using standard methodology. RESULTS: The mean age at onset 
      and duration of disease were 28.7 +/- 8.51 years and 3.5 +/- 0.69 months, 
      respectively. The mean CAG repeat length was 42.5 +/- 4.6, and the ataxia severity 
      score was 16.1 +/- 4.9. Altered DTI scalars signifying degeneration was present in 
      the bilateral anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), corticospinal tract (CST), 
      inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), superior and inferior longitudinal 
      fasciculus (SLF and ILF), uncinate fasciculus (UF), cingulum, corpus callosum 
      (CC), forceps major and forceps minor (corrected p < .05). DTI scalars 
      representing demyelination was seen in the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) and 
      cerebellar WM. There was a significant correlation of SARA score with axial 
      diffusivity of the bilateral cingulum, ATR, CST, forceps minor, IFOF, ILF, SLF 
      and SCP on the right side (corrected p < .05). CONCLUSION: Extensive WM 
      involvement is present in early SCA2. The DTI scalars indicate degeneration and 
      demyelination and may have clinical implications.

TI  - Identification of GGC repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene in amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis.
PG  - e3394-e3405
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000010945 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the GGC repeats in the NOTCH2NLC gene contribute 
      to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). METHODS: In this study, 545 patients with 
      ALS and 1,305 healthy controls from mainland China were recruited. Several 
      pathogenic mutations in known ALS-causative genes (including C9ORF72 and ATXN2) 
      and polynucleotide repeat expansions in NOP56 and AR genes were excluded. 
      Repeat-primed PCR and GC-rich PCR were performed to determine the GGC repeat size 
      in NOTCH2NLC. Systematic and targeted clinical evaluations and investigations, 
      including skin biopsy and dynamic electrophysiologic studies, were conducted in 
      the genetically affected patients. RESULTS: GGC repeat expansion was observed in 
      4 patients (numbers of repeats 44, 54, 96, and 143), accounting for  approximately 0.73% (4 of 
      545) of all patients with ALS. A comparison with 1,305 healthy controls revealed 
      that GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC was associated with ALS (Fisher exact 
      test, 4 of 545 vs 0 of 1,305, p = 0.007). Compared to patients with the neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) muscle weakness-dominant subtype, patients 
      with ALS phenotype carrying the abnormal repeat expansion tended to have a severe 
      phenotype and rapid deterioration. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ALS is a 
      specific phenotype of NIID or that GGC expansion in NOTCH2NLC is a factor that 
      modifies ALS. These findings may help clarify the pathogenic mechanism of ALS and 
      may expand the known clinical spectrum of NIID.

AB  - Increasingly, repeat expansions are being identified as part of the complex 
      genetic architecture of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To date, several repeat 
      expansions have been genetically associated with the disease: intronic repeat 
      expansions in C9orf72, polyglutamine expansions in ATXN2 and polyalanine 
      expansions in NIPA1. Together with previously published data, the identification 
      of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patient with a family history of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, caused by polyglutamine expansions in ATXN1, 
      suggested a similar disease association for the repeat expansion in ATXN1. We, 
      therefore, performed a large-scale international study in 11 700 individuals, in 
      which we showed a significant association between intermediate ATXN1 repeat 
      expansions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (P = 3.33 x 10(-7)). Subsequent 
      functional experiments have shown that ATXN1 reduces the nucleocytoplasmic ratio 
      of TDP-43 and enhances amyotrophic lateral sclerosis phenotypes in Drosophila, 
      further emphasizing the role of polyglutamine repeat expansions in the 
      pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

TI  - Mouse Ataxin-2 Expansion Downregulates CamKII and Other Calcium Signaling

LID - 10.3390/ijms21186673 [doi]

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is caused by polyglutamine expansion in 
      Ataxin-2 (ATXN2). This factor binds RNA/proteins to modify metabolism after 
      stress, and to control calcium (Ca(2+)) homeostasis after stimuli. Cerebellar 
      ataxias and corticospinal motor neuron degeneration are determined by gain/loss 
      in ATXN2 function, so we aimed to identify key molecules in this atrophic 
      process, as potential disease progression markers. Our Atxn2-CAG100-Knock-In 
      mouse faithfully models features observed in patients at pre-onset, early and 
      terminal stages. Here, its cerebellar global RNA profiling revealed 
      downregulation of signaling cascades to precede motor deficits. Validation work 
      at mRNA/protein level defined alterations that were independent of constant 
      physiological ATXN2 functions, but specific for RNA/aggregation toxicity, and 
      progressive across the short lifespan. The earliest changes were detected at 
      three months among Ca(2+) channels/transporters (Itpr1, Ryr3, Atp2a2, Atp2a3, 
      Trpc3), IP(3) metabolism (Plcg1, Inpp5a, Itpka), and Ca(2+)-Calmodulin dependent 
      kinases (Camk2a, Camk4). CaMKIV-Sam68 control over alternative splicing of Nrxn1, 
      an adhesion component of glutamatergic synapses between granule and Purkinje 
      neurons, was found to be affected. Systematic screening of pre/post-synapse 
      components, with dendrite morphology assessment, suggested early impairment of 
      CamKIIalpha abundance together with the weakening of parallel fiber connectivity. 
      These data reveal molecular changes due to ATXN2 pathology, primarily impacting 
      excitability and communication.

TI  - A clinical report of the massive CAG repeat expansion in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 2: Severe onset in a Mexican child and review previous cases.
PG  - e20190325
LID - e20190325
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 is a neurodegenerative disease with autosomal 
      dominant inheritance; clinically characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, 
      slow ocular saccades, nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia, dysarthria, dysphagia, 
      cognitive deterioration, mild dementia, peripheral neuropathy. Infantile onset is 
      a rare presentation that only has been reported in four instances in the 
      literature. In the present work a boy aged 5 years 7 months was studied due to 
      horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus, without saccades, ataxic gait, dysarthria, 
      dysphagia, dysmetria, generalized spasticity mainly pelvic, bilateral Babinsky. 
      The mother aged 27 years-old presented progressive cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, 
      dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesis, limb ataxia and olivopontocerebellar atrophy. The 
      molecular analysis was made by identifying the expansion repeats in tandem by 
      long PCR to analyze the repeats in the ATXN2 gene. We found an extreme CAG 
      expansion repeats of ~884 repeats in the child. We describe a Mexican child 
      affected by SCA2 with an infantile onset, associated with a high number of CAG 
      repeats previously no reported and anticipation phenomenon.

TI  - Conversion of individuals at risk for spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, and 6 
      to manifest ataxia (RISCA): a longitudinal cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative diseases. Our aim was to study the conversion to manifest 
      ataxia among apparently healthy carriers of mutations associated with the most 
      common SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6), and the sensitivity of clinical and 
      functional measures to detect change in these individuals. METHODS: In this 
      prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study, based at 14 referral 
      centres in seven European countries, we enrolled children or siblings of patients 
      with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6. Eligible individuals were those without ataxia, 
      defined by a score on the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) of 
      less than 3; participants had to be aged 18-50 years for children or siblings of 
      patients with SCA1, SCA2, or SCA3, and 35-70 years for children or siblings of 
      patients with SCA6. Study visits took place at recruitment and after 2, 4, and 6 
      years (plus or minus 3 months). We did genetic testing to identify mutation 
      carriers, with results concealed to the participant and clinical investigator. We 
      assessed patients with clinical scales, questionnaires of patient-reported 
      outcome measures, a rating of the examiner's confidence of presence of ataxia, 
      and performance-based coordination tests. Conversion to ataxia was defined by an 
      SARA score of 3 or higher. We analysed the association of factors at baseline 
      with conversion to ataxia and the evolution of outcome parameters on temporal 
      scales (time from inclusion and time to predicted age at ataxia onset) in the 
      context of mutation status and conversion status. This study is registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01037777. FINDINGS: Between Sept 13, 2008, and Oct 28, 
      2015, 302 participants were enrolled. We analysed data for 252 participants with 
      at least one follow-up visit. 83 (33%) participants were from families affected 
      by SCA1, 99 (39%) by SCA2, 46 (18%) by SCA3, and 24 (10%) by SCA6. In 
      participants who carried SCA mutations, 26 (52%) of 50 SCA1 carriers, 22 (59%) of 
      37 SCA2 carriers, 11 (42%) of 26 SCA3 carriers, and two (13%) of 15 SCA6 carriers 
      converted to ataxia. One (3%) of 33 SCA1 non-carriers and one (2%) of 62 SCA2 
      non-carriers converted to ataxia. Owing to the small number of people who met our 
      criteria for ataxia, subsequent analyses could not be done in carriers of the 
      SCA6 mutation. Baseline factors associated with conversion were age (hazard ratio 
      1.13 [95% CI 1.03-1.24]; p=0.011), CAG repeat length (1.25 [1.11-1.41]; 
      p=0.0002), and ataxia confidence rating (1.72 [1.23-2.41]; p=0.0015) for SCA1; 
      age (1.08 [1.02-1.14]; p=0.0077) and CAG repeat length (1.65 [1.27-2.13]; 
      p=0.0001) for SCA2; and age (1.27 [1.09-1.50]; p=0.0031), confidence rating (2.60 
      [1.23-5.47]; p=0.012), and double vision (14.83 [2.15-102.44]; p=0.0063) for 
      SCA3. From the time of inclusion, the SARA scores of SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 
      mutation carriers increased, whereas they remained stable in non-carriers. On a 
      timescale defined by the predicted time of ataxia onset, SARA progression in 
      SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 mutation carriers was non-linear, with marginal progression 
      before ataxia and increasing progression after ataxia onset. INTERPRETATION: Our 
      study provides quantitative data on the conversion of non-ataxic SCA1, SCA2, and 
      SCA3 mutation carriers to manifest ataxia. Our data could prove useful for the 
      design of preventive trials aimed at delaying the onset of ataxia by aiding 
      sample size calculations and stratification of study participants. FUNDING:

LID - 156
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic familiar causes of oro-facial dyskinesia are usually 
      restricted to Huntington's disease, whereas other causes are often missed or 
      underestimated. Here, we report the case of late-onset oro-facial dyskinesia in 
      an elderly patient with a genetic diagnosis of Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 2 
      (SCA2). CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old man complained of progressive balance 
      difficulty since the age of 60 years, associated with involuntary movements of 
      the mouth and tongue over the last 3 months. No exposure to anti-dopaminergic 
      agents, other neuroleptics, antidepressants, or other drugs was reported. Family 
      history was positive for SCA2 (brother and the son of the brother). At rest, 
      involuntary movements of the mouth and tongue were noted; they appeared partially 
      suppressible and became more evident during stress and voluntary movements. 
      Cognitive examination revealed frontal-executive dysfunction, memory impairment, 
      and attention deficit. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed signs of 
      posterior periventricular chronic cerebrovascular disease and a marked 
      ponto-cerebellar atrophy, as confirmed by volumetric MRI analysis. A dopamine 
      transporter imaging scan demonstrated a bilaterally reduced putamen and caudate 
      nucleus uptake. Ataxin-2 (ATXN2) gene analysis revealed a 36 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansion, confirming the diagnosis of 
      SCA2. CONCLUSIONS: SCA2 should be considered among the possible causes of 
      adult-onset oro-facial dyskinesia, especially when the family history suggests an 
      inherited cerebellar disorder. Additional clinical features, including 
      parkinsonism and motor neuron disease, may represent relevant cues for an early 
      diagnosis and adequate management.

AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) gene ATXN2 has a prominent role in the 
      pathogenesis and treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In addition to 
      cerebellar ataxia, motor neuron disease is often seen in SCA2, and ATXN2 CAG 
      repeat expansions in the long normal range increase ALS risk. Also, lowering 
      ATXN2 expression in TDP-43 ALS mice prolongs their survival. Here we investigated 
      the ATXN2 relationship with motor neuron dysfunction in vivo by comparing spinal 
      cord (SC) transcriptomes reported from TDP-43 and SOD1 ALS mice and ALS patients 
      with those from SCA2 mice. SC transcriptomes were determined using an SCA2 
      bacterial artificial chromosome mouse model expressing polyglutamine expanded 
      ATXN2. SCA2 cerebellar transcriptomes were also determined, and we also 
      investigated the modification of gene expression following treatment of SCA2 mice 
      with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) lowering ATXN2 expression. Differentially 
      expressed genes (DEGs) defined three interconnected pathways (innate immunity, 
      fatty acid biosynthesis and cholesterol biosynthesis) in separate modules 
      identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Other key pathways 
      included the complement system and lysosome/phagosome pathways. Of all DEGs in 
      SC, 12.6% were also dysregulated in the cerebellum. Treatment of mice with an 
      ATXN2 ASO also modified innate immunity, the complement system and 
      lysosome/phagosome pathways. This study provides new insights into the underlying 
      molecular basis of SCA2 SC phenotypes and demonstrates annotated pathways shared 
      with TDP-43 and SOD1 ALS mice and ALS patients. It also emphasizes the importance 
      of ATXN2 in motor neuron degeneration and confirms ATXN2 as a therapeutic target.

TI  - Live births following preimplantation genetic testing for dynamic mutation 
      diseases by karyomapping: a report of three cases.
PG  - 539-548
LID - 10.1007/s10815-020-01718-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic defects (PGT-M) is a 
      beneficial strategy for the patients suffering from a Mendelian disease, which 
      could protect their offspring from inheriting the disease. The purpose of this 
      study is to report the effectiveness of PGT-M based on karyomapping for three 
      cases of dynamic mutation diseases with trinucleotide repeat expansion. METHODS: 
      PGT-M was carried out on three couples, whose family members were diagnosed with 
      Huntington's disease or spinocerebellar ataxias 2 or 12. The whole genome 
      amplification was obtained using the multiple displacement amplification (MDA) 
      method. Then, karyomapping was performed to detect the allele that is carrying 
      the trinucleotide repeat expansion using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
      linkage analyses, and the copy number variations (CNVs) of the embryos were also 
      identified. Prenatal diagnosis was performed to validate the accuracy of PGT-M. 
      RESULTS: PGT-M was successfully performed on the three couples, and they accepted 
      the transfers of euploid blastocysts without the relevant pathogenic allele. The 
      clinical pregnancies were acquired and the prenatal diagnosis of the three 
      families confirmed the effectiveness of karyomapping. The three born babies were 
      healthy and free of the pathogenic alleles HTT, ATXN2, or PPP2R2B corresponding 
      to Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxias 2 or 12, respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: This study shows that karyomapping is a highly powerful and efficient 
      approach for dynamic mutation detection in preimplantation embryos. In this work, 
      we first report the birth of healthy babies that are free of the pathogenic gene 
      for dynamic mutation diseases in patients receiving PGT-M by karyomapping.

AB  - The underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms that drive amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) remain poorly understood. Structural variants within the genome 
      can play a significant role in neurodegenerative disease risk, such as the repeat 
      expansion in C9orf72 and the tri-nucleotide repeat in ATXN2, both of which are 
      associated with familial and sporadic ALS. Many such structural variants reside 
      in uncharacterized regions of the human genome, and have been under studied. 
      Therefore, characterization of structural variants located in and around genes 
      associated with ALS could provide insight into disease pathogenesis, and lead to 
      the discovery of highly informative genetic tools for stratification in clinical 
      trials. Such genomic variants may provide a deeper understanding of how gene 
      expression can affect disease etiology, disease severity and trajectory, patient 
      response to treatment, and may hold the key to understanding the genetics of 
      sporadic ALS. This article outlines the current understanding of amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis genetics and how structural variations may underpin some of the 
      missing heritability of this disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 1-2-17 
      (SCA1-2-17) are adult-onset autosomal dominant diseases, caused by triplet repeat 
      expansions in the HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, and TBP genes. Alleles with a repeat number 
      just below the pathological threshold are associated with reduced penetrance and 
      meiotic instability and are defined as intermediate alleles (IAs). OBJECTIVES: We 
      aimed to determine the frequencies of IAs in healthy Italian subjects and to 
      compare the proportion of the IAs with the prevalence of the respective diseases. 
      METHODS: We analyzed the triplet repeat size in HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, and TBP genes 
      in the DNA samples from 729 consecutive adult healthy Italian subjects. RESULTS: 
      IAs associated with reduced penetrance were found in ATXN2 gene (1 subject, 0.1%) 
      and TBP gene (0.82%). IAs at risk for meiotic instability were found in HTT 
      (5.3%) and ATXN2 genes (2.7%). In ATXN1, we found a low percentage of IAs (0.4%). 
      Alleles lacking the common CAT interruption within the CAG sequence were also 
      rare (0.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The high frequencies of IAs in HTT and ATXN2 genes 
      suggest a correlation with the prevalence of the diseases in our population and 
      support the hypothesis that IAs could represent a reservoir of new pathological 
      expansions. On the opposite, ATXN1-IA were very rare in respect to the prevalence 
      of SCA1 in our country, and TBP- IA were more frequent than expected, suggesting 
      that other mechanisms could influence the occurrence of novel pathological 
      expansions.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), a rare polyglutamine neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin-2 gene, exhibits common 
      cellular phenotypes with other neurodegenerative disorders, including oxidative 
      stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we show that SCA2 patient cells 
      exhibit higher levels of caspase-8- and caspase-9-mediated apoptotic activation 
      than control cells, cellular phenotypes that we find to be exacerbated by 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibition of autophagy. We also suggest that 
      oligomerization of mutant ataxin-2 protein is likely to be the cause of the 
      observed cellular phenotypes by causing inhibition of autophagy and by inducing 
      ROS generation. Finally, we show that removal of ataxin-2 oligomers, either by 
      increasing autophagic clearance or by oligomer dissolution, appears to alleviate 
      the cellular phenotypes. Our results suggest that oligomerized ataxin-2 and 
      oxidative stress affect autophagic clearance in SCA2 cells, contributing to the 
      pathophysiology, and that activation of autophagy or clearance of oligomers may 
      prove to be effective therapeutic strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      due to a CAG-repeat expansion. This work is intended to identify modifiers of the 
      clinical phenotype in SCA2, following up on recent genome-wide association 
      analyses that demonstrated the prominent role of DNA-damage repair and 
      methylation for the severity and progression of polyglutamine diseases. In 
      particular, we assessed the impact of MTHFR as rate-limiting enzyme in DNA 
      methylation pathways, which modulates cerebellar neurotransmission and motor 
      neuron atrophy. METHODS: A sample of 166 Cuban SCA2 patients and of 130 healthy 
      subjects from the same geographical and ethnic background was selected. The ATXN2 
      CAG repeat length was determined by PCR followed by polyacrylamide gel 
      electrophoresis. Two amino acid substitutions known to decrease the enzyme 
      activity of MTHFR, encoded by C677T and A1298C polymorphisms, were assessed by 
      PCR/RFLP. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed for C677T or A1298C 
      alleles or genotype frequencies between cases and controls, confirming that 
      disease risk in SCA2 does not depend on MTHFR activity. However, MTHFR A1298C 
      genotypes showed a significant association with saccade latency. CONCLUSIONS: 
      \MTHFR A1298C polymorphism is associated with saccade latency in SCA2 patients, 
      but not with disease risk, age at onset or maximal saccade velocity. These 
      results provide evidence that folate-mediated one...carbon metabolism might be 
      important in the physiopathology of SCA2.

AB  - We analyzed the frequency of intermediate alleles (IAs) in the ATXN1, ATXN2, and 
      HTT genes in several neurodegenerative diseases. The study included 1126 patients 
      with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 440 patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 
      and 610 patients with Parkinson's disease. In all cohorts, we genotyped ATXN1 and 
      ATXN2 CAG repeats. In addition, in the FTD cohort, we determined the number of 
      HTT CAG repeats. The frequency of HTT IAs was higher in patients with FTD (6.9%) 
      versus controls (2.9%) and in the C9orf72 expansion noncarriers (7.2%) versus 
      controls (2.9%), although the difference was nonsignificant after correction for 
      multiple testing. Compared with controls, progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) 
      groups showed a significantly higher frequency of HTT IAs (13.6% vs. 2.9% 
      controls). For the ATXN2 gene, we observed an increase in IA frequency in AD 
      cases (AD 4.1% vs. controls 1.8%) and in the behavioral FTD group (4.8% vs. 
      1.8%). For the ATXN1 gene, we found a significant increase of IAs in patients 
      with PNFA (18.6%) versus controls (6.7%). In conclusion, our work suggests that 
      the HTT and ATXN1 IAS may contribute to PNFA pathogenesis and point to a link 
      between ATXN2 IAS and AD.

TI  - In Human and Mouse Spino-Cerebellar Tissue, Ataxin-2 Expansion Affects 
      Ceramide-Sphingomyelin Metabolism.

LID - 5854
AB  - Ataxin-2 (human gene symbol ATXN2) acts during stress responses, modulating mRNA 
      translation and nutrient metabolism. Ataxin-2 knockout mice exhibit progressive 
      obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Conversely, the progressive ATXN2 
      gain of function due to the fact of polyglutamine (polyQ) expansions leads to a 
      dominantly inherited neurodegenerative process named spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      2 (SCA2) with early adipose tissue loss and late muscle atrophy. We tried to 
      understand lipid dysregulation in a SCA2 patient brain and in an authentic mouse 
      model. Thin layer chromatography of a patient cerebellum was compared to the 
      lipid metabolome of Atxn2-CAG100-Knockin (KIN) mouse spinocerebellar tissue. The 
      human pathology caused deficits of sulfatide, galactosylceramide, cholesterol, 
      C22/24-sphingomyelin, and gangliosides GM1a/GD1b despite quite normal levels of 
      C18-sphingomyelin. Cerebellum and spinal cord from the KIN mouse showed a 
      consistent decrease of various ceramides with a significant elevation of 
      sphingosine in the more severely affected spinal cord. Deficiency of 
      C24/26-sphingomyelins contrasted with excess C18/20-sphingomyelin. 
      Spinocerebellar expression profiling revealed consistent reductions of CERS 
      protein isoforms, Sptlc2 and Smpd3, but upregulation of Cers2 mRNA, as prominent 
      anomalies in the ceramide-sphingosine metabolism. Reduction of Asah2 mRNA 
      correlated to deficient S1P levels. In addition, downregulations for the elongase 
      Elovl1, Elovl4, Elovl5 mRNAs and ELOVL4 protein explain the deficit of very 
      long-chain sphingomyelin. Reduced ASMase protein levels correlated to the 
      accumulation of long-chain sphingomyelin. Overall, a deficit of myelin lipids was 
      prominent in SCA2 nervous tissue at prefinal stage and not compensated by 
      transcriptional adaptation of several metabolic enzymes. Myelination is 
      controlled by mTORC1 signals; thus, our human and murine observations are in 
      agreement with the known role of ATXN2 yeast, nematode, and mouse orthologs as 
      mTORC1 inhibitors and autophagy promoters.

TI  - TDP-43 levels in the brain tissue of ALS cases with and without C9ORF72 or ATXN2 
      gene expansions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the amount of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated TAR 
      DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in the motor brain regions of cases of 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with and without repeat expansions in the 
      ATXN2 or C9ORF72 genes. METHODS: The 45-kDa phosphorylated form of TDP-43 and 
      43-kDa nonphosphorylated form of TDP-43 were quantified by immunoblot in 
      postmortem brain tissue from the motor cortex, spinal cord, and cerebellar vermis 
      of 23 cases with ALS with repeat expansions in the ATXN2 or C9ORF72 genes and 
      sporadic disease and 10 controls. RESULTS: Significantly greater levels of 
      phosphorylated TDP-43 were identified in the motor cortex of cases with ALS with 
      C9ORF72 expansions, and significantly greater amounts of phosphorylated TDP-43 
      were found in the spinal cord of cases with ALS with intermediate ATXN2 
      expansions. In contrast, however, similar levels of nonphosphorylated TDP-43 were 
      found in all 3 regions between ALS groups. CONCLUSION: Despite its central role 
      in the pathogenesis of ALS and the emergence of potential targets to modify its 
      aggregation, TDP-43 levels have not been quantified in pathologically confirmed 
      cases with ALS. The present results demonstrating significant differences in 
      phosphorylated but not nonphosphorylated TDP-43 levels suggest that different 
      posttranslational modifications are involved in the generation of greater 
      pathologic TDP-43 levels identified here in our cohort of cases with genetic 
      expansions. These findings are consistent with emerging studies implicating 
      distinct pathomechanisms in the generation of pathologic TDP-43 in cases with ALS 
      with C9ORF72 or ATXN2 expansions and are of relevance to therapeutic research 
      aimed at reducing pathologic TDP-43 in all or a subset of patients with ALS.

AB  - Although the heritability of cognitive function in old age is substantial, 
      genome-wide association studies have had limited success in elucidating its 
      genetic basis, leaving a considerable amount of "missing heritability." Aside 
      from single nucleotide polymorphisms, genome-wide association studies are unable 
      to assess other large sources of genetic variation, such as tandem repeat 
      polymorphisms. Therefore, here, we studied the association of 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat variations in polyglutamine 
      disease-associated genes (PDAGs) with cognitive function in older adults. In a 
      large cohort consisting of 5786 participants, we found that the CAG repeat number 
      in 3 PDAGs (TBP, HTT, and AR) were significantly associated with the decline in 
      cognitive function, which together accounted for 0.49% of the variation. 
      Furthermore, in an magnetic resonance imaging substudy, we found that CAG repeat 
      polymorphisms in 4 PDAGs (ATXN2, CACNA1A, ATXN7, and AR) were associated with 
      different imaging characteristics, including brain stem, putamen, globus 
      pallidus, thalamus, and amygdala volumes. Our findings indicate that tandem 
      repeat polymorphisms are associated with cognitive function in older adults and 
      highlight the importance of PDAGs in elucidating its missing heritability.

AB  - Rare missense variants play a crucial role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 
      pathophysiology. We report rare/novel missense variants from 154 Indian ALS 
      patients, identified through targeted sequencing of 25 ALS-associated genes. As 
      pathogenic variants could explain only a small percentage of ALS pathophysiology 
      in our cohort, we investigated the frequency of tolerated and benign novel/rare 
      variants, which could be potentially ALS susceptible. These variants were 
      identified in 5.36% (8/149) of sporadic ALS (sALS) cases; with one novel variant 
      each in ERBB4, SETX, DCTN1, and MATR3; four rare variants, one each in PON2 and 
      ANG and two different rare variants in SETX. Identified variants were either 
      absent or present at extremely rare frequencies (MAF < 0.01) in large population 
      databases and were absent in 50 healthy controls sequenced through Sanger method. 
      Furthermore, an oligogenic basis of ALS was observed in three sALS, with 
      co-occurrence of intermediate-length repeat expansions in ATXN2 and a rare/novel 
      variant in DCTN1 and SETX genes. Additionally, molecular dynamics and biochemical 
      functional analysis of an angiogenin variant (R21G) identified from our cohort 
      demonstrated loss of ribonucleolytic and nuclear translocation activities. Our 
      findings suggest that rare variants could be potentially pathogenic and 
      functional studies are warranted to decisively establish the pathogenic 
      mechanisms associated with them.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the time and frequency domain measures of cardiac autonomic 
      activity/tone in patients of genetically defined spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 
      types 1 and 2, as well as to decipher the probable associations among the 
      cardiovascular autonomic parameters and genetic and clinical characteristics. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Simultaneous 5-min recording of RR interval (RRI) and 
      blood pressure (BP) for the calculation of heart rate variability (HRV), blood 
      pressure variability (BPV) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) were performed in 
      genotypically confirmed SCA1 (n = 31) and SCA2 (n = 40) patients and healthy 
      controls (n = 40). Additionally, the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating 
      Scale (ICARS) was used for scoring of clinical severity in SCA patients. RESULTS: 
      Time and frequency domain parameters of HRV, BPV and BRS were depressed in SCA1 
      and SCA2 subtypes as compared to controls, although there was no statistically 
      significant difference in autonomic tone between the two SCA subtypes. On 
      correlation analysis, autonomic tone parameters were found to be associated with 
      the clinical and genetic features of the SCA subtypes. Also, ICARS was associated 
      with the genotype (CAG repeat length) in SCA2 patents. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac 
      autonomic tone is depressed in both SCA1 and 2 as compared to healthy controls 
      while the two SCA subtypes do not differ in terms of autonomic tone. Also, a 
      typical association exists between disease characteristics and autonomic indices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of more than one polyQ-related gene within a single 
      individual is a rare incidence, which may provide the potential opportunity to 
      study the combined effects of these spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) genes. METHODS: 
      We retrospectively analyzed genetic data from 112 SCA3 probands and found Patient 
      1 harbored expanded ATXN2 allele (33 repeats) and intermediate TBP allele (41 
      repeats), and Patient 2 with intermediate ATXN2 allele (32 repeats). Detailed 
      clinical and oculomotor performances were investigated. The age at onset and 
      oculomotor parameters of both patients were compared with matched pure SCA3 
      groups controlling either disease severity or CAG repeats. RESULTS: Most of the 
      clinical phenotypes and oculomotor characteristics of these two patients were 
      common to typical SCA3 patients. Compared to pure SCA3 groups controlling disease 
      severity, mild reduced horizontal saccade velocity could be detected in both 
      patients. However, mild expansions of the ATXN2 allele seemed to have no 
      influence on the age at onset of Patient 1 but might have a mild impact on 
      Patient 2. CONCLUSION: Our study provides supporting evidence that mild 
      expansions of ATXN2 may have modifying effects on SCA3 phenotype. Larger control 
      series and longitudinal data are warranted to confirm our results.

TI  - (CAG)(n) loci as genetic modifiers of age at onset in patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 from mainland China.
PG  - 1130-1136
LID - 10.1111/ene.13954 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The expanded repeat length in ATXN1 negatively correlates 
      with age at onset (AAO) of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) but can explain 
      only part of it, indicating that other factors affect AAO. Some studies have 
      explored the influence of non-causative CAG repeats on the AAO of SCA patients. 
      However, studies on Chinese SCA1 patients regarding candidate modifier factors 
      involved in the variability in AAO are rare. METHODS: In all, 152 Chinese SCA1 
      patients who were genotyped for ATXN1 and nine other (CAG)(n) -containing genes 
      were enrolled. Regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of the 
      expanded allele of ATXN1 (linear and quadratic effects) on AAO. Then, different 
      models were used to explore the modulatory effect of nine other (CAG)(n) 
      -containing genes. RESULTS: Our results verified the negative effect of the 
      expanded allele in ATXN1 by regression analysis. Some (CAG)(n) -containing genes 
      including TBP, ATN1 and HTT modified AAO with variance ranging from 0.8% to 3.8% 
      and tended to decrease or delay AAO. However, no modifier effects of ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, KCNN3, RAI1 and normal ATXN1 alleles in trans were 
      detected. CONCLUSION: By using interaction analyses, TBP, ATN1 and HTT were 
      determined to have modifying effects. Our study revealed that differences in 
      modulation may be due to ethnic and geographic diversity across different 
      populations. Furthermore, the variability of AAO was not completely explained by 
      the genetic modifiers examined here, suggesting that other genetic or 
      environmental factors are involved in these diseases.

TI  - Association of ATXN2 intermediate-length CAG repeats with amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis correlates with the distributions of normal CAG repeat alleles among 
      individual ethnic populations.
PG  - 65-71
LID - 10.1007/s10048-019-00570-9 [doi]
AB  - Intermediate-length CAG repeats in ATXN2 have been widely shown to be a risk 
      factor for sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS). To evaluate the 
      association of ATXN2 intermediate-length CAG repeat alleles with an increased 
      risk of SALS, we investigated distributions of CAG repeat alleles in 394 patients 
      with SALS and 490 control individuals in the Japanese population. In the 
      intermediate-length repeat units of 29 or more, we identified one SALS patient 
      with 31 repeat units and two control individuals with 30 repeat units. Thus, no 
      significant differences in the carrier frequency of intermediate-length CAG 
      repeat alleles were detected between patients with SALS and control individuals. 
      When we investigated the distribution of "large normal alleles" defined as ATXN2 
      CAG repeats ranging from 24 up to 33 in the Japanese population compared with 
      those in other populations in previous studies, the frequency of large normal 
      alleles was significantly higher in the European and North American series than 
      in the Japanese series. Moreover, these frequencies in the Turkish, Chinese, 
      Korean, and Brazilian (Latin American) series were also higher than that in the 
      Japanese series. These results raise the possibility that the frequencies of 
      large normal alleles in individual populations underlie the frequencies of ALS 
      risk alleles in the corresponding populations.

TI  - Large normal alleles of ATXN2 decrease age at onset in transthyretin familial 
      amyloid polyneuropathy Val30Met patients.
PG  - 251-258

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Transthyretin (TTR)-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is 
      an autosomal dominant neurological disease, caused most frequently by a Val30Met 
      (now classified as Val50Met) substitution in TTR. Age at onset (AO) ranges from 
      19 to 82 years, and variability exists mostly between generations. Unstable 
      oligonucleotide repeats in various genes are the mechanism behind several 
      neurological diseases, found also to act as modifiers for other disorders. Our 
      aim was to investigate whether large normal repeat alleles of 10 genes had a 
      possible modifier effect in AO in Portuguese TTR-FAP Val30Met families. METHODS: 
      We analyzed 329 Portuguese patients from 123 families. Repeat length (at ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, TBP, ATN1, HTT, JPH3, AR, and DMPK) was assessed by single 
      and multiplex polymerase chain reaction, using fluorescently labeled primers, 
      followed by capillary electrophoresis. We used a family-centered approach, and 
      generalized estimating equations were used to account for AO correlation between 
      family members. RESULTS: For ATXN2, the presence of at least 1 allele longer than 
      22 CAGs was significantly associated with an earlier onset in TTR-FAP Val30Met, 
      decreasing mean AO by 6 years (95% confidence interval = -8.81 to -2.19, p = 
      0.001). No association was found for the remaining repeat loci. INTERPRETATION: 
      Length of normal repeats at ATXN2 may modify AO in TTR-FAP Val30Met and may 
      function as a risk factor. This can be due to the role of ATXN2 in RNA metabolism 
      and as a modulator of various cellular processes, including mitochondrial stress. 
      This may have relevant implications for prognosis and the follow-up of 
      presymptomatic carriers. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:251-258.

AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominant disease 
      characterized by progressive degeneration of the cerebellum, brain stem, and 
      spinal cord. SCA2 is caused by spontaneous misfolding and aggregate formation 
      from abnormal CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the coding region of the 
      ATXN2 gene. Here we describe the generation of two distinct iPSC lines from 
      patients with SCA2.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to reappraise the progression of the five 
      most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) in the Chinese population and to 
      establish a much-needed critical comparison with that in other ethnic groups. 
      There are very few longitudinal cohort studies of SCAs in Asian populations. An 
      intriguing finding in an earlier study demonstrated a faster progression of SCA 
      among Chinese than that among Caucasians. METHODS: Patients with SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, SCA6 or SCA17 were consecutively assessed using the scale for the 
      assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA) for five years. A linear mixed model was 
      used to compare the annual progression rates measured using the SARA among 
      patients with different SCA subtypes. Predictors of the progression rates were 
      analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 199 patients with SCA (10 with SCA1, 37 with SCA2, 
      118 with SCA3, 25 with SCA6 and 9 with SCA17) were enrolled. The mean annual 
      increase in SARA scores was 1.23 points for SCA1, 1.52 points for SCA2, 1.60 
      points for SCA3, 0.99 points for SCA6 and 3.26 points for SCA17. A larger CAG 
      repeat length (>/=74) was associated with faster progression in SCA3, whereas a 
      lower total SARA score at the first visit (<12) was associated with faster 
      clinical progression in SCA6. CONCLUSION: The results of this study confirm that 
      the annual progression rates of SCA2 and SCA3 are comparable between Han Chinese 
      and other ethnic populations. More studies are warranted to confirm the rapid 
      progression of SCA17 observed in our cohort.

AB  - Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeat instability and protein aggregation are thought to be 
      two major and independent drivers of cellular aging. Pbp1, the yeast ortholog of 
      human ATXN2, maintains rDNA repeat stability and lifespan via suppression of 
      RNA-DNA hybrids. ATXN2 polyglutamine expansion drives neurodegeneration causing 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 and promoting amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Here, 
      molecular characterization of Pbp1 revealed that its knockout or subjection to 
      disease-modeling polyQ expansion represses Ty1 (Transposons of Yeast) 
      retrotransposons by respectively promoting Trf4-depedendent RNA turnover and Ty1 
      Gag protein aggregation. This aggregation, but not its impact on 
      retrotransposition, compromises rDNA repeat stability and shortens lifespan by 
      hyper-activating Trf4-dependent turnover of intergenic ncRNA within the repeats. 
      We uncover a function for the conserved Pbp1/ATXN2 proteins in the promotion of 
      retrotransposition, create and describe powerful yeast genetic models of 
      ATXN2-linked neurodegenerative diseases, and connect the major aging mechanisms 
      of rDNA instability and protein aggregation.

AB  - Intermediate-length ATXN2 CAG repeats are a risk factor for amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS). Here we report on a female patient with heterozygous repeat 
      expansion mutation in the CACNA1A gene presenting with a pure ALS syndrome while 
      her father, who also carries that CACNA1A mutation, suffers from a classical 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 6. Hypothesizing that CACNA1A CAG repeat expansions 
      could be a monogenic cause for familial ALS (fALS), we analyzed the CAG repeat 
      lengths in CACNA1A in a large cohort of genetically unexplained patients with 
      fALS. Our results indicate that CAG repeat expansion mutations in CACNA1A are not 
      a frequent monogenic cause of fALS but could phenotypically present as ALS in 
      rare instances.

AB  - Common genetic risk factors are associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Intermediate repeat expansions at the 
      Ataxin-2 locus (ATXN2) are a risk factor for ALS and influence the phenotype. We 
      assessed whether ATXN2 is a risk factor for FTD or modify clinical features in a 
      data set of Italian patients. Three hundred sixty-eight unrelated FTD cases and 
      342 controls were enrolled. The frequency of intermediate CAG repeats in ATXN2 
      gene was not different comparing patients and controls. CAG repeats were 
      interrupted by CAA in all patients carrying intermediate repeats. Interestingly, 
      patients with an increased number of CAG repeats had an earlier onset of the 
      disease than those without expansions (p = 0.011), and presented more frequently 
      with parkinsonism (p = 0.010), and psychotic symptoms (p = 0.013) at disease 
      onset. Our study does not support a major role of ATXN2 intermediate CAG 
      expansions in predisposing to FTD but suggests that ATXN2 may act as a phenotype 
      modifier.

AB  - Genomewide association studies (GWASs) have contributed greatly to unraveling the 
      genetic basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a large amount of "missing 
      heritability" remains. In this exploratory study, we investigated the effect of 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in polyglutamine disease-associated genes 
      (PDAGs) on the risk of AD and its expression. In a cohort of 959 patients 
      diagnosed with AD (Amsterdam Dementia cohort) and 4106 cognitively healthy 
      participants (Leiden 85-plus Study and the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in 
      the Elderly at Risk), we determined the CAG repeat sequences in ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, HTT, ATN1, and AR. We did not find a significant 
      association between the risk of AD and variations in CAG repeat numbers of PDAGs. 
      However, we found that differences in CAG repeat numbers in ATXN1, ATXN2, and AR 
      were significantly associated with several clinical and imaging features in AD 
      patients. Specifically, the association between memory performance in patients 
      with AD and the CAG repeat size in the longer ATXN1 allele, and the association 
      between atrophy in the medial temporal lobes and the CAG repeat number in the 
      longer AR allele remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Our 
      findings suggest that repeat polymorphisms in ATXN1 and AR can act as important 
      genetic modifiers of AD, warranting further scrutiny of their role in its missing 
      heritability and pathogenesis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the non-ataxic clinical manifestations in genetically 
      proven Spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) and identify their determinants and 
      predictors. METHODS: Seventy-three subjects with genetically proven SCA2 were 
      evaluated clinically for the common non-ataxic manifestations. Based on the 
      presence or absence of non-ataxic manifestations, patients were classified into 
      groups and then compared for significant differences in the CAG repeat length, 
      age at onset (AAO), duration of disease, and ataxia rating score. Predictors of 
      non-ataxic symptoms were identified using multivariable binary logistic 
      regression. RESULTS: The most common non-ataxic clinical manifestations were 
      peripheral neuropathy, extrapyramidal features, pyramidal signs, cognitive 
      impairment and lower motor neuron signs. The CAG repeat length was inversely 
      related to the AAO of symptoms (r...=...-0.46, p...<....001). Patients with peripheral 
      neuropathy and psychiatric symptoms had earlier AAO. Patients with cognitive 
      impairment and extrapyramidal symptoms had higher CAG repeat length whereas 
      presence of lower motor neuron signs was more common in patients with lower CAG 
      repeat length. CONCLUSION: The lower strength of association between CAG repeat 
      length and AAO in our cohort suggests the presence of additional factors 
      underlying the variability in AAO. Both CAG repeat length and AAO were identified 
      as significant determinants and predictors of non-ataxic symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by CAG repeat expansions in ATXN2 on chromosome 
      12q24. Patients present with adult-onset progressive gait ataxia, slow saccades, 
      nystagmus, dysarthria and peripheral neuropathy. Dystonia is known to occur as 
      SCA2 advances, but is rarely the presenting symptom. CASE PRESENTATION: A 
      43-year-old right handed woman presented with focal dystonia of the right hand 
      which started two years earlier with difficulty writing. There were only mild 
      cerebellar signs. Her mother was reported to have a progressive gait disorder and 
      we subsequently learned that she had SCA2. A total of 10 maternal family members 
      were similarly affected. Over the course of 10 years, the patient's cerebellar 
      signs progressed only mildly however the dystonia worsened to the extent of 
      inability to use her right hand. Dystonia did not improve significantly with 
      botulinum toxin, levodopa or trihexyphenidyl, but has shown marked improvement 
      since DBS implantation in the GPi. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a patient with SCA2 
      who presented with focal dystonia of the right upper extremity. Subtle cerebellar 
      signs as well as the family history became especially important given the absence 
      of predominant gait ataxia. Our case emphasizes that focal dystonia is not only a 
      feature of SCA2, but can also rarely be the presenting sign as well as the most 
      prominent feature during the disease course.

TI  - Repeat length variations in polyglutamine disease-associated genes affect body 
      mass index.
PG  - 440-449
LID - 10.1038/s41366-018-0161-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The worldwide prevalence of obesity, a major risk factor for numerous 
      debilitating chronic disorders, is increasing rapidly. Although a substantial 
      amount of the variation in body mass index (BMI) is estimated to be heritable, 
      the largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to date 
      explained only ~2.7% of the variation. To tackle this 'missing heritability' 
      problem of obesity, here we focused on the contribution of DNA repeat length 
      polymorphisms which are not detectable by GWAS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We 
      determined the cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat length in the nine known 
      polyglutamine disease-associated genes (ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, 
      HTT, ATN1 and AR) in two large cohorts consisting of 12,457 individuals and 
      analyzed their association with BMI, using generalized linear mixed-effect 
      models. RESULTS: We found a significant association between BMI and the length of 
      CAG repeats in seven polyglutamine disease-associated genes (including ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP and AR). Importantly, these repeat variations 
      could account for 0.75% of the total BMI variation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      incriminate repeat polymorphisms as an important novel class of genetic risk 
      factors of obesity and highlight the role of the brain in its pathophysiology.

TI  - Long-term evolution of patient-reported outcome measures in spinocerebellar 
      ataxias.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To study the long-term evolution of patient-reported outcome 
      measures (PROMs) in the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), we analyzed 
      8 years follow-up data of the EUROSCA Natural History Study, a cohort study of 
      526 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6. METHODS: To assess the functional 
      capacity in daily living, we used the functional assessment (part IV) of the 
      Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS-IV), for health-related quality 
      of life the visual analogue scale of the EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire 
      (EQ-5D VAS), and for depressive symptoms the Patient Health Questionnaire 
      (PHQ-9). Severity of ataxia was assessed using the Scale for the Assessment and 
      Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and neurological symptoms other than ataxia with the 
      Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS). RESULTS: UHDRS-IV [SCA1: - 1.35 (0.12); 
      SCA2: - 1.15 (0.11); SCA3: - 1.16 (0.11); SCA6: - 0.99 (0.12)] and EQ-5D [SCA1: 
      - 2.88 (0.72); SCA2: - 1.97 (0.49); SCA3: - 2.06 (0.55); SCA6: - 1.03 (0.57)] 
      decreased linearly, whereas PHQ-9 increased [SCA1: 0.15 (0.04); SCA2: 0.09 
      (0.03); SCA3: 0.06 (0.04); SCA6: 0.07 (0.04)] during the observational period. 
      Standard response means (SRMs) of UHDRS-IV (0.473-0.707) and EQ-5D VAS 
      (0.053-0.184) were lower than that of SARA (0.404-0.979). In SCA1, higher SARA 
      scores [- 0.0288 (0.01), p = 0.0251], longer repeat expansions [- 0.0622 (0.02), 
      p = 0.0002] and the presence of cognitive impairment at baseline [- 0.5381 
      (0.25), p = 0.0365] were associated with faster UHDRS-IV decline. In SCA3, higher 
      INAS counts were associated with a faster UHDRS-IV decline [- 0.05 (0.02), 
      p = 0.0212]. In SCA1, PHQ-9 progression was faster in patients with cognitive 
      impairment [0.14 (0.07); p = 0.0396]. CONCLUSIONS: In the common SCAs, PROMs give 
      complementary information to the information provided by neurological scales. 
      This underlines the importance of PROMs as additional outcome measures in future 
      interventional trials.

AB  - Intermediate-length cytosine-adenine-guanine nucleotide repeat expansions in the 
      ATXN2 gene (which encodes for the protein Ataxin-2) have been linked to increased 
      risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in different populations. There is 
      no such study in the Brazilian population, which has a mixed ethnic background. 
      We have thus selected 459 patients with ALS (372 Sporadic ALS and 87 Familial 
      ALS) and 468 control subjects from 6 Brazilian centers to investigate this point. 
      We performed polymerase chain reaction to determine the length of the ATXN2 
      alleles. Polymerase chain reaction products were resolved using capillary 
      electrophoresis on ABI 3500 x l capillary sequencer. We found that ATXN2 
      intermediate-length expansions (larger than 26 repeats) were associated with an 
      increased risk for ALS (odds ratio = 2.56, 95% confidence interval: 1.29-5.08, 
      p = 0.005). Phenotype in patients with and without ATXN2 expansions was similar. 
      Our findings support the hypothesis that ATXN2 plays an important role in the 
      pathogenesis of ALS also in the Brazilian population.

AB  - Studies on genetic aberrations among Indian amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 
      patients are limited to C9orf72 and ATXN2 repeat expansions and mutations in the 
      SOD1 gene. In this study, we used targeted next-generation sequencing to analyze 
      25 ALS-associated genes in a cohort of 154 Indian ALS patients. We identified 
      known pathogenic mutations in SOD1 (G148D; H44R), TARDBP (M337V; N267S), DAO 
      (R199Q), and ANG (K41I). In addition, we also identified 7 potentially pathogenic 
      missense variants that have not been previously reported in ALS patients; this 
      includes 3 novel variants (OPTN: K489E, DAO: E121K, and SETX: L2163V) that are 
      not reported in large population databases and 4 rare variants (CHMP2B: E45K, 
      SQSTM1: G262R and P438L, ERBB4: R103H) with a minor allele frequency of <0.01 in 
      large population databases. All known pathogenic, novel, and rare variants were 
      detected in only 1 ALS patient each with the exception of the OPTN (K489E) 
      variant that was detected in 2 patients in our cohort. In sum, we identified 
      known and potentially pathogenic novel and rare mutations in 14 (9.1%) ALS 
      patients in our cohort. This study represents the first comprehensive genetic 
      analysis in the ethnically diverse population and thus provides a new insight 
      into the genetics of Indian ALS patients.

AB  - Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, characterised 
      by a triad of movement disorder, emotional and behavioural disturbances and 
      cognitive impairment. The underlying cause is an expanded CAG repeat in the 
      huntingtin gene. For a small proportion of patients presenting with HD-like 
      symptoms, the mutation in this gene is not identified and they are said to have a 
      HD "phenocopy". South Africa has the highest number of recorded cases of an 
      African-specific phenocopy, Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2), caused by a repeat 
      expansion in the junctophilin-3 gene. However, a significant proportion of black 
      patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of HD still test negative for HD and 
      HDL2. This study thus aimed to investigate five other loci associated with HD 
      phenocopy syndromes - ATN1, ATXN2, ATXN7, TBP and C9orf72. In a sample of 
      patients in whom HD and HDL2 had been excluded, a single expansion was identified 
      in the ATXN2 gene, confirming a diagnosis of Spinocerebellar ataxia 2. The 
      results indicate that common repeat expansion disorders do not contribute 
      significantly to the HD-like phenotype in black South African patients. 
      Importantly, allele sizing reveals unique distributions of normal repeat lengths 
      across the associated loci in the African population studied.

TI  - Factors associated with ATXN2 CAG/CAA repeat intergenerational instability in 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2.
PG  - 346-350
LID - 10.1111/cge.13380 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      the unstable expansion of a cytosine-adenine-guanine 
      (CAG)/cytosine-adenine-adenine (CAA) repeat in the ATXN2 gene, which normally 
      encodes 22 glutamines (Q22). A large study was conducted to characterize the 
      CAG/CAA repeat intergenerational instability in SCA2 families. Large normal 
      alleles (Q24-31) were significantly more unstable upon maternal transmissions. In 
      contrast, expanded alleles (Q32-750) were significantly more unstable during 
      paternal transmissions, in correlation with repeat length. Significant 
      correlations were found between the instability and the age at conception in 
      paternal transmissions. In conclusion, intergenerational instability at ATXN2 
      locus is influenced by the sex, repeat length and age at conception of the 
      transmitting parent. These results have profound implications for genetic 
      counseling services.

AB  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an adult onset, progressive, neurodegenerative 
      disorder of unknown etiology characterized by autonomic dysfunction, parkinsonism 
      (MSA-P) and cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C). The phenotypic spectrum may present 
      overlapping features with other neurodegenerative diseases, particularly the 
      autosomal dominant inherited polyglutamine disorders. To investigate the possible 
      contribution of CAG expansions in the MSA phenotype, we analyzed the triplet 
      repeat length in the autosomal dominant causative genes for spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) type 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 17, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) 
      and Huntington disease (HD) in a cohort of 246 Italian MSA patients. As 
      comparison, 223 controls were also analyzed. The alleles were classified on the 
      basis of CAG repeat length as "normal", "intermediate" or "expanded" according to 
      literature. The MSA patients (101 men/145 women) had a mean age at onset of 58 
      years and a mean age at genetic testing of 63 years. MSA-C patients had 
      significantly younger age at onset and at examination in comparison to MSA-P 
      (p...<...0.0001). We identified a SCA1 intermediate allele in a MSA-C subject (36 
      CAG), a SCA2 intermediate allele in a MSA-P patient (31 CAG), and a 
      pathologically expanded SCA2 allele (36 CAG) in a patient initially misdiagnosed 
      as MSA-C. No intermediate or expanded SCA alleles were detected in controls. The 
      distribution of CAG repeat length was similar among groups except for SCA1 gene 
      that showed a higher percentage of longer normal alleles in MSA-C as compared to 
      MSA-P and controls (p...<...0.0001). This study supports the utility of polyQ genetic 
      testing in the differential diagnosis of MSA, and may suggest a possible role of 
      SCA1 repeat length as risk factor for MSA-C. SCA1 and SCA2 genetic screening is 
      recommended in MSA Italian patients.

TI  - Genetic testing for clinically suspected spinocerebellar ataxias: report from a 
      tertiary referral centre in India.
PG  - 219-224
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      syndromes, characterized by a wide range of muscular weakness and motor deficits, 
      caused due to cerebellar degeneration. The prevalence of the syndromes of SCA 
      varies across the world and is known to be linked to the instability of 
      trinucleotide repeats within the high-end normal alleles, along with susceptible 
      haplotype. We estimated sizes of the CAG or GAA repeat expansions at the SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA12 and frataxin loci among 864 referrals of subjects to genetic 
      counselling and testing (GCAT) clinic, National Institute of Mental Health and 
      Neurosciences, Bengaluru, India, with suspected SCA. The most frequent mutations 
      detected were SCA1 (n = 100 (11.6%)) and SCA2 (n = 98 (11.3%)) followed by SCA3 
      (n = 40 (4.6%)), FRDA (n = 20 (2.3%)) and SCA12 (n = 8 (0.9%)).

AB  - ATXN2 intermediate-length trinucleotide repeat expansions have been reported as a 
      risk factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in various ethnicities. We 
      tried to confirm this finding in Korean patients with ALS by screening ATXN2 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine nucleotide sequences (CAG) repeat lengths in 464 
      unrelated ALS patients and 703 controls. The most common and the highest CAG 
      repeat lengths in the controls were 22 and 28, respectively, whereas those in ALS 
      patients were 22 and 33, respectively. The frequency of CAG repeat lengths of 30 
      or more was significantly different between the 2 groups after Bonferroni 
      correction (1.5% in ALS vs. 0% in controls, corrected p = 0.0075). There were no 
      significant differences in gender, age at onset, site of onset, functional rating 
      scale-revised score at initial visit, calculated progression rate, or survival 
      between patients with CAG repeat lengths of 30-33 and patients with CAG repeat 
      lengths <30. These findings support the notion that intermediate-length ATXN2 
      repeat expansions might be a risk factor in Korean patients with ALS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias are dominantly inherited progressive ataxia 
      disorders that can lead to premature death. We aimed to study the overall 
      survival of patients with the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, and SCA6) and to identify the strongest contributing predictors that affect 
      survival. METHODS: In this longitudinal cohort study (EUROSCA), we enrolled men 
      and women, aged 18 years or older, from 17 ataxia referral centres in ten 
      European countries; participants had positive genetic test results for SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 and progressive, otherwise unexplained, ataxias. Survival was 
      defined as the time from enrolment to death for any reason. We used the Cox 
      regression model adjusted for age at baseline to analyse survival. We used 
      prognostic factors with a p value less than 0.05 from a multivariate model to 
      build nomograms and assessed their performance based on discrimination and 
      calibration. The EUROSCA study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
      NCT02440763. FINDINGS: Between July 1, 2005, and Aug 31, 2006, 525 patients with 
      SCA1 (n=117), SCA2 (n=162), SCA3 (n=139), or SCA6 (n=107) were enrolled and 
      followed up. The 10-year survival rate was 57% (95% CI 47-69) for SCA1, 74% 
      (67-81) for SCA2, 73% (65-82) for SCA3, and 87% (80-94) for SCA6. Factors 
      associated with shorter survival were: dysphagia (hazard ratio 4.52, 95% CI 
      1.83-11.15) and a higher value for the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of 
      Ataxia (SARA) score (1.26, 1.19-1.33) for patients with SCA1; older age at 
      inclusion (1.04, 1.01-1.08), longer CAG repeat length (1.16, 1.03-1.31), and 
      higher SARA score (1.15, 1.10-1.20) for patients with SCA2; older age at 
      inclusion (1.44, 1.20-1.74), dystonia (2.65, 1.21-5.53), higher SARA score (1.26, 
      1.17-1.35), and negative interaction between CAG and age at inclusion (0.994, 
      0.991-0.997) for patients with SCA3; and higher SARA score (1.17, 1.08-1.27) for 
      patients with SCA6. The nomogram-predicted probability of 10-year survival showed 
      good discrimination (c index 0.905 [SD 0.027] for SCA1, 0.822 [0.032] for SCA2, 
      0.891 [0.021] for SCA3, and 0.825 [0.054] for SCA6). INTERPRETATION: Our study 
      provides quantitative data on the survival of patients with the most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, based on a long follow-up period. These results have 
      implications for the design of future interventional studies of spinocerebellar 
      ataxias; for example, the prognostic survival nomogram could be useful for 
      selection and stratification of patients. Our findings need validation in an 
      external population before they can be used to counsel patients and their 
      families. FUNDING: European Union 6th Framework programme, German Ministry of

AB  - Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a complex and multifactorial neurodegenerative 
      disease, and its pathogenesis remains uncertain. Patients with MSA or 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) show overlapping clinical phenotypes. Previous 
      studies have reported that intermediate or long CAG expansions in SCA genes have 
      been associated with other neurodegenerative disease. In this study, we screened 
      for the number of CAG repeats in ATXN1, 2 and 3 in 200 patients with MSA and 314 
      healthy controls to evaluate possible associations between (CAG)(n) in these 
      three polyQ-related genes and MSA. Our findings indicated that longer repeat 
      lengths in ATXN2 were associated with increased risk for MSA in Chinese 
      individuals. No relationship was observed between CAG repeat length in the three 
      examined genes and age at onset (AO) of MSA.

TI  - Brain atrophy measures in preclinical and manifest spinocerebellar ataxia type 2.
PG  - 128-137

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominantly 
      inherited neurodegenerative disease mainly affecting the cerebellum and 
      brainstem. In this Cuban-German research collaboration, we aimed to characterize 
      atrophy patterns and associations with clinical measures in preclinical and 
      manifest SCA2. METHODS: In this study, 16 nonmanifest SCA2 mutation carriers, 26 
      manifest patients with SCA2, and 18 healthy control subjects underwent magnetic 
      resonance imaging, as well as genetic and clinical characterization including 
      assessment of ataxia (Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia) and saccade 
      velocity in Cuba were enrolled. Semiautomated quantitative volumetry of the 
      cerebellum and brainstem, subdivided into the medulla oblongata, the pontine 
      brainstem, and mesencephalon was performed. Additionally, the anteroposterior 
      diameter of the pontine brainstem was measured. RESULTS: Analysis of volumetric 
      data revealed degeneration of the cerebellum and brainstem, in particular of 
      pontine volumes and the anteroposterior diameter of the pons, in both manifest 
      SCA2 patients and individuals at risk for SCA2 compared to controls. Comparing 
      patients with nonataxic preclinical SCA2 mutation carriers, we found more 
      pronounced reductions of the pontine brainstem and cerebellum in manifest SCA2. 
      Volumetric data further showed associations with CAG repeat length and predicted 
      age of onset in preclinical SCA2 individuals, and by trend with ataxia signs in 
      patients. Although saccade velocity was associated with reduction in the pontine 
      brainstem in preclinical and manifest SCA2, reduced ability to suppress 
      interfering stimuli measured by the Stroop task was related to cerebellar volume 
      loss in patients. INTERPRETATION: Preclinical SCA2 mutation carriers exhibit 
      brain abnormalities, which could be targeted as surrogate parameters for disease 
      progression and in future preventive trials.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7, associated with a (CAG)(n) 
      repeat expansion in coding sequences, are the most prevalent autosomal dominant 
      ataxias worldwide (approximately 60% of the cases). In addition, the phenotype of 
      SCA2 expansions has been now extended to Parkinson disease and amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis. Their diagnosis is currently based on a PCR to identify small 
      expanded alleles, followed by a second-level test whenever a false normal 
      homozygous or a CAT interruption in SCA1 needs to be verified. Next-generation 
      sequencing still does not allow efficient detection of these repeats. Here, we 
      show the efficacy of a novel, rapid, and cost-effective method to identify and 
      size pathogenic expansions in SCA1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 and recognize large alleles or 
      interruptions without a second-level test. Twenty-five healthy controls and 33 
      expansion carriers were analyzed: alleles migrated consistently in different PCRs 
      and capillary runs, and homozygous individuals were always distinguishable from 
      heterozygous carriers of both common and large (>100 repeats) pathogenic CAG 
      expansions. Repeat number could be calculated counting the number of peaks, 
      except for the largest SCA2 and SCA7 alleles. Interruptions in SCA1 were always 
      visible. Overall, our method allows a simpler, cost-effective, and sensibly 
      faster SCA diagnostic protocol compared with the standard technique and to the 
      still unadapted next-generation sequencing.

AB  - Cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansions in the coding regions of nine 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) genes (HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATN1, AR, 
      and TBP) are the cause of several neurodegenerative diseases including 
      Huntington's disease (HD), six different spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. The 
      expanded CAG repeat length in the causative gene is negatively related to the 
      age-at-onset (AAO) of clinical symptoms. In addition to the expanded CAG repeat 
      length in the causative gene, the normal CAG repeats in the other polyQ genes can 
      affect the AAO, suggesting functional interactions between the polyQ genes. 
      However, there is no detailed assessment of the relationships among polyQ genes 
      in pathologically relevant brain regions. We used gene co-expression analysis to 
      study the functional relationships among polyQ genes in different brain regions 
      using the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), a spatial map of gene expression in the 
      healthy brain. We constructed co-expression networks for seven anatomical brain 
      structures, as well as a region showing a specific pattern of atrophy in HD 
      patients detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. In this 
      HD-associated region, we found that ATN1 and ATXN2 were co-expressed and shared 
      co-expression partners which were enriched for DNA repair genes. We observed a 
      similar co-expression pattern in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and striatum in 
      which this relation was most pronounced. Given that the co-expression patterns 
      for these anatomical structures were similar to those for the HD-associated 
      region, our results suggest that their disruption is likely involved in HD 
      pathology. Moreover, ATN1 and ATXN2 also shared many co-expressed genes with HTT, 
      the causative gene of HD, across the brain. Although this triangular relationship 
      among these three polyQ genes may also be dysregulated in other polyQ diseases, 
      stronger co-expression patterns between ATN1 and ATXN2 observed in the 
      HD-associated region, especially in the striatum, may be more specific to HD.

TI  - OPTN p.Met468Arg and ATXN2 intermediate length polyQ extension in families with 
      C9orf72 mediated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.
PG  - 75-85
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32606 [doi]
AB  - We have ascertained two families affected with familial amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) in which they both carry a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the 
      C9orf72 gene, specifically in individuals who also presented with frontotemporal 
      dementia (FTD) or behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD). While some reports attribute 
      this phenotypic heterogeneity to the C9orf72 expansion alone, we screened for 
      additional genetic variation in known ALS-FTD genes that may also contribute to 
      or modify the phenotypes. We performed genetic testing consisting of C9orf72 
      hexanucleotide expansion, ATXN2 polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion, and targeted 
      next generation sequencing using the ONDRISeq, a gene panel consisting of 80 
      genes known to be associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, FTD, 
      Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and vascular cognitive impairment. In 
      addition to the C9orf72 expansion, we observed an ATXN2 polyQ intermediate length 
      expansion, and OPTN p.Met468Arg in patients who exhibited ALS and FTD or bvFTD. 
      We conclude that the C9orf72 expansion likely explains much of the ALS-FTD 
      phenotype; however, inheritance of these additional variants likely modifies the 
      disease course and may provide further evidence for biologically relevant 
      oligogenic inheritance in ALS.

TI  - Postural Tremor and Ataxia Progression in Spinocerebellar Ataxias.
PG  - 492
LID - 10.7916/D8GM8KRH [doi]
LID - 492
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postural tremor can sometimes occur in spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs). However, the prevalence and clinical characteristics of postural tremor 
      in SCAs are poorly understood, and whether SCA patients with postural tremor have 
      different ataxia progression is not known. METHODS: We studied postural tremor in 
      315 patients with SCA1, 2, 3, and 6 recruited from the Clinical Research 
      Consortium for Spinocerebellar Ataxias (CRC-SCA), which consists of 12 
      participating centers in the United States, and we evaluated ataxia progression 
      in these patients from January 2010 to August 2012. RESULTS: Among 315 SCA 
      patients, postural tremor was most common in SCA2 patients (SCA1, 5.8%; SCA2, 
      27.5%; SCA3, 12.4%; SCA6, 16.9%; p = 0.007). SCA3 patients with postural tremor 
      had longer CAG repeat expansions than SCA3 patients without postural tremor 
      (73.67 +/- 3.12 vs. 70.42 +/- 3.96, p = 0.003). Interestingly, SCA1 and SCA6 patients 
      with postural tremor had a slower rate of ataxia progression (SCA1, beta = -0.91, p 
      < 0.001; SCA6, beta = -1.28, p = 0.025), while SCA2 patients with postural tremor 
      had a faster rate of ataxia progression (beta = 1.54, p = 0.034). We also found that 
      the presence of postural tremor in SCA2 patients could be influenced by repeat 
      expansions of ATXN1 (beta = -1.53, p = 0.037) and ATXN3 (beta = 0.57, p = 0.018), 
      whereas postural tremor in SCA3 was associated with repeat lengths in TBP (beta = 
      0.63, p = 0.041) and PPP2R2B (beta = -0.40, p = 0.032). DISCUSSION: Postural tremor 
      could be a clinical feature of SCAs, and the presence of postural tremor could be 
      associated with different rates of ataxia progression. Genetic interactions 
      between ataxia genes might influence the brain circuitry and thus affect the 
      clinical presentation of postural tremor.

AB  - Polyglutamine disorders are neurodegenerative diseases that share a CAG repeat 
      expansion in the coding region, resulting in aggregated proteins that can be only 
      degraded through aggrephagy. We measured the expression of autophagy genes in 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 20 patients with Huntington's disease (HD), 
      20 with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), and 20 healthy individuals. HD 
      patients showed increased expression of MAP1LC3B (+ 43%; p = 0.048), SQSTM1 
      (+ 49%; p = 0.002), and WDFY3 (+ 89%; p < 0.001). SCA2 patients had increased 
      expression of WDFY3 (+ 69%; p < 0.001). We show that peripheral markers of 
      autophagy are elevated in polyQ diseases, and this is particularly evident in HD.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is part of a group of at least nine 
      dominantly inherited disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of 
      specific neuronal populations and a shared mutational mechanism involving the 
      expansion of a CAG repeat tract in coding regions of novel genes. Efforts have 
      been made to identify biomarkers of disease progression, which would allow timely 
      preventive therapeutic interventions. In the present study was assessed the 
      influence of several genome instability biomarkers on SCA2 clinical severity. A 
      case-control design was applied on exfoliated epithelial buccal cells to 
      determine micronuclei frequency and others nuclear anomalies, using 5% Giemsa 
      stains. The slides were analyzed under 1000X magnification and nuclei 
      morphological anomalies were identified according to Tolbert PE, et al. (1992) 
      and Bolognesi C, et al. (2013) criteria. It was found a highly significant 
      increase in micronuclei frequency in cases related to age and sex-matched healthy 
      controls (p <0.001). There was a trend for karyolytic, pyknotic and condensed 
      chromatin cells to be increased in SCA2 cases, and a significant association was 
      found between binucleated cells and disease duration (r = 0.46; p = 0.027). Nor 
      the CAG repeat length neither the age at onset correlated significantly with any 
      of the studied markers (p >0.05). Our results are consistent with report previous 
      in similar neurodegenerative diseases, and suggest that micronuclei and 
      binucleated cells constitute potential peripheral biomarkers for SCA2. These 
      results should be validated by other studies.

TI  - Genetic Screening for Spinocerebellar Ataxia Genes in a Japanese Single-Hospital 
      Cohort.
PG  - 116-122
LID - 10.14802/jmd.17011 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diagnosis of sporadic cerebellar ataxia is a challenge for 
      neurologists. A wide range of potential causes exist, including chronic alcohol 
      use, multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type (MSA-C), and sporadic late 
      cortical cerebellar atrophy. Recently, an autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) mutation was identified in a cohort of patients with non-MSA-C 
      sporadic cerebellar ataxia. The aim of this study is to genetically screen genes 
      involved in SCA in a Japanese single-hospital cohort. METHODS: Over an 8-year 
      period, 140 patients with cerebellar ataxia were observed. There were 109 
      patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia (no family history for at least four 
      generations, 73 patients with MSA-C, and 36 patients with non-MSA-C sporadic 
      cerebellar ataxia) and 31 patients with familial cerebellar ataxia. We performed 
      gene analysis comprising SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 17, 31, and 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) in 28 of 31 non-MSA-C sporadic 
      patients who requested the test. Familial patients served as a control. RESULTS: 
      Gene abnormalities were found in 57% of non-MSA-C sporadic cerebellar ataxia 
      cases. Among patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia, abnormalities in SCA6 were 
      the most common (36%), followed by abnormalities in SCA1 (7.1%), SCA2 (3.6%), 
      SCA3 (3.6%), SCA8 (3.6%), and DRPLA (3.6%). In contrast, gene abnormalities were 
      found in 75% of familial cerebellar ataxia cases, with abnormalities in SCA6 
      being the most common (29%). For sporadic versus familial cases for those with 
      SCA6 abnormalities, the age of onset was older (69 years vs. 59 years, 
      respectively), and CAG repeat length was shorter (23 vs. 25, respectively) in the 
      former than in the latter (not statistically significant). CONCLUSION: 
      Autosomal-dominant mutations in SCA genes, particularly in SCA6, are not rare in 
      sporadic cerebellar ataxia. The reason for the frequency of mutations in SCA6 
      remains unclear; however, the reason may reflect a higher age at onset and 
      variable penetrance of SCA6 mutations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the genetic risk conferred by known amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS)-associated genes to the pathogenesis of sporadic ALS (SALS) using 
      variant allele frequencies combined with predicted variant pathogenicity. 
      METHODS: Whole exome sequencing and repeat expansion PCR of C9orf72 and ATXN2 
      were performed on 87 patients of European ancestry with SALS seen at the 
      University of Utah. DNA variants that change the protein coding sequence of 31 
      ALS-associated genes were annotated to determine which were rare and deleterious 
      as predicted by MetaSVM. The percentage of patients with SALS with a rare and 
      deleterious variant or repeat expansion in an ALS-associated gene was calculated. 
      An odds ratio analysis was performed comparing the burden of ALS-associated genes 
      in patients with SALS vs 324 normal controls. RESULTS: Nineteen rare 
      nonsynonymous variants in an ALS-associated gene, 2 of which were found in 2 
      different individuals, were identified in 21 patients with SALS. Further, 5 
      deleterious C9orf72 and 2 ATXN2 repeat expansions were identified. A total of 
      17.2% of patients with SALS had a rare and deleterious variant or repeat 
      expansion in an ALS-associated gene. The genetic burden of ALS-associated genes 
      in patients with SALS as predicted by MetaSVM was significantly higher than in 
      normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: Previous analyses have identified SALS-predisposing 
      variants only in terms of their rarity in normal control populations. By 
      incorporating variant pathogenicity as well as variant frequency, we demonstrated 
      that the genetic risk contributed by these genes for SALS is substantially lower 
      than previous estimates.

TI  - Large normal-range TBP and ATXN7 CAG repeat lengths are associated with increased 
      lifetime risk of depression.
PG  - e1143
LID - 10.1038/tp.2017.116 [doi]
AB  - Depression is one of the most prevalent and debilitating psychiatric disorders 
      worldwide. Recently, we showed that both relatively short and relatively long 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in the huntingtin gene (HTT) are 
      associated with an increased risk of lifetime depression. However, to what extent 
      the variations in CAG repeat length in the other eight polyglutamine 
      disease-associated genes (PDAGs) are associated with depression is still unknown. 
      We determined the CAG repeat sizes of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, 
      ATN1 and AR in two well-characterized Dutch cohorts-the Netherlands Study of 
      Depression and Anxiety and the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older 
      Persons-including 2165 depressed and 1058 non-depressed individuals-aged 18-93 
      years. The association between PDAG CAG repeat size and the risk for depression 
      was assessed via binary logistic regression. We found that the odds ratio (OR) 
      for lifetime depression was significantly higher for individuals with >10, 
      compared with subjects with </=10, CAG repeats in both ATXN7 alleles (OR=1.90, 
      confidence interval (CI) 1.26-2.85). For TBP we found a similar association: A 
      CAG repeat length exceeding the median in both alleles was associated with an 
      increased risk for lifetime depression (OR=1.33, CI 1.00-1.76). In conclusion, we 
      observed that carriers of either ATXN7 or TBP alleles with relatively large CAG 
      repeat sizes in both alleles had a substantially increased risk of lifetime 
      depression. Our findings provide critical evidence for the notion that repeat 
      polymorphisms can act as complex genetic modifiers of depression.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine heritability of the residual variability of spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 2 (SCA2) age at onset (AO) after controlling for CAG repeat length. 
      METHODS: From 1955 to 2001, dates of birth, CAG repeat lengths, AO, sex, familial 
      inheritances, and clinical manifestations were collected for a large Cuban SCA2 
      cohort of 382 affected individuals, including 129 parent-child pairs and 69 
      sibships. Analyses were performed with log-transformed AO in the GENMOD procedure 
      to predict AO using repeat length, taking into account family structure. Because 
      all relationships were first degree, the model was implemented with an 
      exchangeable correlation matrix. Familial correlations were estimated using the 
      Pedigree Analysis Package to control for similarity due to genetic relatedness. 
      RESULTS: For the entire sample, the mutant CAG repeat allele explained 69% of AO 
      variance. When adjusted for pedigree structure, this decreased to 50%. Evidence 
      for imprinting or sex-specific effects of the CAG repeat on AO was not found. For 
      the entire sample, we determined an upper bound for heritability of the residual 
      variance of 33% (p = 0.008). Heritability was higher in sib-sib pairs, especially 
      in female sib-sib pairs, than in parent-child pairs. CONCLUSIONS: We established 
      that a large proportion of AO variance in SCA2 was determined by genetic 
      modifiers in addition to CAG repeat length. The genetic structure of heritability 
      of the residual AO variance was surprisingly similar to Huntington disease, 
      suggesting the presence of recessive modifying alleles and possibly 
      X-chromosome-linked modifiers.

TI  - Genetic Identification in Early Onset Parkinsonism among Norwegian Patients.
PG  - 499-508
LID - 10.1002/mdc3.12501 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An initial diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is challenging, 
      especially in patients who have early onset and atypical disease. A genetic 
      etiology for parkinsonism, when established, ends that diagnostic odyssey and may 
      inform prognosis and therapy. The objective of this study was to elucidate the 
      genetic etiology of parkinsonism in patients with early onset disease (age at 
      onset <45 years). METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing, copy number variability, and 
      short tandem repeat analyses were performed. The analyses were focused on genes 
      previously implicated in parkinsonism and dystonia in patients with early onset 
      parkinsonism. Genotype-phenotype correlations were assessed using regression 
      models. RESULTS: The patient cohort was characterized by early onset, slowly 
      progressive parkinsonism with a mean age at onset of 39.2 +/- 5.0 years (n = 108). 
      By 10 years of disease duration, the mean Hoehn & Yahr stage was 2.6 +/- 0.8, the 
      mean Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, part III (motor part) score was 
      24.9 +/- 12.1 (n = 83), and 30 patients were cognitively impaired at the last 
      examination (Montreal Cognitive Assessment score </= 26). Ten patients with typical 
      early onset PD harbored homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations phosphatase 
      and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) (n = 4), parkin (PRKN) (n = 
      3), or the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) c.6055 G to A transition (n = 3). 
      In addition, 5 patients with more atypical disease were compound heterozygotes 
      for the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) (n = 3) 1 was heterozygous for solute 
      carrier family 2, member 1 (SLC2A1) and another carried a novel ataxin 2 (ATXN2) 
      exon 1 duplication. In most patients, the cumulative mutational burden did not 
      appear to contribute to age at onset or progression. CONCLUSION: In this clinical 
      series, 15 patients (14%) carried mutations that were linked to monogenic 
      parkinsonism. GBA carriers were most likely to suffer an earlier cognitive 
      demise. Nevertheless, the etiology for most patients with early onset PD remains 
      to be determined.

AB  - Repeat expansions in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) gene have 
      been recognized as a major contributor to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 
      frontotemporal dementia in the Caucasian population. Intermediate length repeat 
      expansions of CAG (polyQ) repeat in the ATXN2 gene have also been reported to 
      increase the risk of developing ALS in North America and Europe. We screened 131 
      ALS patients and 127 healthy controls from India for C9orf72 and ATXN2 repeat 
      expansions. We found pathogenic hexanucleotide expansions in 3 of the 127 
      sporadic ALS patients, in 1 of the 4 familial ALS patients, and in none of the 
      healthy controls. In addition, our findings suggest that the 10 base-pair 
      deletion that masks detection of C9orf72 repeat expansion does not explain the 
      low frequency of this repeat expansion among Indian ALS patients. Intermediate 
      length polyQ expansions (27Qs-32Qs) in the ATXN2 gene were detected in 6 of the 
      127 sporadic ALS patients and 2 of the 127 of the healthy controls. Long ATXN2 
      polyQ repeats (>/=33Qs) were not present in any of the ALS patients or controls. 
      Our findings highlight the need for large-scale multicenter studies on Indian ALS 
      patients to better understand the underlying genetic causes.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN2 gene. The repeat resides in 
      an encoded region of the gene resulting in polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion which 
      has been assumed to result in gain of function, predominantly, for the ATXN2 
      protein. We evaluated temporal cerebellar expression profiles by RNA sequencing 
      of ATXN2Q127 mice versus wild-type (WT) littermates. ATXN2Q127 mice are 
      characterized by a progressive motor phenotype onset, and have progressive 
      cerebellar molecular and neurophysiological (Purkinje cell firing frequency) 
      phenotypes. Our analysis revealed previously uncharacterized early and 
      progressive abnormal patterning of cerebellar gene expression. Weighted Gene 
      Coexpression Network Analysis revealed four gene modules that were significantly 
      correlated with disease status, composed primarily of genes associated with 
      GTPase signaling, calcium signaling and cell death. Of these genes, few 
      overlapped with differentially expressed cerebellar genes that we identified in 
      Atxn2-/- knockout mice versus WT littermates, suggesting that loss-of-function is 
      not a significant component of disease pathology. We conclude that SCA2 is a 
      disease characterized by gain of function for ATXN2.

TI  - A panel study on patients with dominant cerebellar ataxia highlights the 
      frequency of channelopathies.
PG  - 1579-1594
LID - 10.1093/brain/awx081 [doi]
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias have a marked heterogeneous genetic 
      background, with mutations in 34 genes identified so far. This large amount of 
      implicated genes accounts for heterogeneous clinical presentations, making 
      genotype-phenotype correlations a major challenge in the field. While 
      polyglutamine ataxias, linked to CAG repeat expansions in genes such as ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, CACNA1A and TBP, have been extensively characterized in 
      large cohorts, there is a need for comprehensive assessment of frequency and 
      phenotype of more 'conventional' ataxias. After exclusion of CAG/polyglutamine 
      expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia genes in 412 index cases with dominantly 
      inherited cerebellar ataxias, we aimed to establish the relative frequencies of 
      mutations in other genes, with an approach combining panel sequencing and TaqMan(R) 
      polymerase chain reaction assay. We found relevant genetic variants in 59 
      patients (14.3%). The most frequently mutated were channel genes [CACNA1A (n = 
      16), KCND3 (n = 4), KCNC3 (n = 2) and KCNA1 (n = 2)]. Deletions in ITPR1 (n = 11) 
      were followed by biallelic variants in SPG7 (n = 9). Variants in AFG3L2 (n = 7) 
      came next in frequency, and variants were rarely found in STBN2 (n = 2), ELOVL5, 
      FGF14, STUB1 and TTBK2 (n = 1 each). Interestingly, possible risk factor variants 
      were detected in SPG7 and POLG. Clinical comparisons showed that ataxias due to 
      channelopathies had a significantly earlier age at onset with an average of 24.6 
      years, versus 40.9 years for polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias and 
      37.8 years for SPG7-related forms (P = 0.001). In contrast, disease duration was 
      significantly longer in the former (20.5 years versus 9.3 and 13.7, P=0.001), 
      though for similar functional stages, indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. Of interest, intellectual deficiency was more frequent in channel 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, while cognitive impairment in adulthood was similar 
      among the three groups. Similar differences were found among a single gene group, 
      comparing 23 patients with CACNA1A expansions (spinocerebellar ataxia 6) to 22 
      patients with CACNA1A point mutations, which had lower average age at onset (25.2 
      versus 47.3 years) with longer disease duration (18.7 versus 10.9), but lower 
      severity indexes (0.39 versus 0.44), indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. In conclusion, we identified relevant genetic variations in up to 15% of 
      cases after exclusion of polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias, and 
      confirmed CACNA1A and SPG7 as major ataxia genes. We could delineate firm 
      genotype-phenotype correlations that are important for genetic counselling and of 
      possible prognostic value.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused 
      by a CAG repeat expansion in the ataxin-2 gene. We show increased oxidative 
      stress, abnormalities in the antioxidant system, changes in complexes involved in 
      oxidative phosphorylation and changes in mitochondrial morphology in SCA2 patient 
      fibroblasts compared to controls, and we show that treatment with CoQ10 can 
      partially reverse these changes. Together, our results suggest that oxidative 
      stress and mitochondrial dysfunction may be contributory factors to the 
      pathophysiology of SCA2 and that therapeutic strategies involving manipulation of 
      the antioxidant system could prove to be of clinical benefit.

TI  - C9orf72 and ATXN2 repeat expansions coexist in a family with ataxia, dementia, 
      and parkinsonism.
PG  - 158-162
LID - 10.1002/mds.26841 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intermediate interrupted ataxin 2 (ATXN2) alleles (27-33 CAG-repeats) 
      increase the risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and are reported as modifiers 
      in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) carriers, rendering 
      susceptibility to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis rather than frontotemporal lobar 
      degeneration. The clinical presentation of C9orf72 patients with pathogenic ATXN2 
      alleles (>/=35 CAG-repeats) is unknown. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 
      a family affected by ataxia, dementia, and parkinsonism, but not amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis. Mutation analyses of the proband included C9orf72 and 14 
      ataxia genes, followed by segregation analyses in family members. RESULTS: Both 
      affected siblings carry an uninterrupted 37-repeat expansion in ATXN2 and a 
      methylated G(4) C(2) -repeat allele in C9orf72 that is typical of large 
      pathogenic expansions. CONCLUSIONS: The CAG-expansion in ATXN2 likely caused the 
      ataxia, whereas the dementia may be linked to both C9orf72 and ATXN2 repeat 
      expansions. The pathological uninterrupted ATXN2 repeat may not have the same 
      modifying effect as intermediate interrupted alleles. (c) 2016 International

AB  - We investigated a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the ATXN2 gene in 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Two new case-control studies, a British 
      dataset of 1474 ALS cases and 567 controls, and a Dutch dataset of 1328 ALS cases 
      and 691 controls were analyzed. In addition, to increase power, we systematically 
      searched PubMed for case-control studies published after 1 August 2010 that 
      investigated the association between ATXN2 intermediate repeats and ALS. We 
      conducted a meta-analysis of the new and existing studies for the relative risks 
      of ATXN2 intermediate repeat alleles of between 24 and 34 CAG trinucleotide 
      repeats and ALS. There was an overall increased risk of ALS for those carrying 
      intermediate sized trinucleotide repeat alleles (odds ratio 3.06 [95% confidence 
      interval 2.37-3.94]; p = 6 x 10(-18)), with an exponential relationship between 
      repeat length and ALS risk for alleles of 29-32 repeats (R(2) = 0.91, p = 
      0.0002). No relationship was seen for repeat length and age of onset or survival. 
      In contrast to trinucleotide repeat diseases, intermediate ATXN2 trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion in ALS does not predict age of onset but does predict disease 
      risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 is a neurodegenerative disorder caused 
      by a CAG repeat expansion in ATXN2 gene. There is high clinical variability among 
      affected patients suggesting the occurring of modifier genes influencing the 
      clinical phenotype. OBJECTIVE: The objective is to assess the association of 
      GSTO1 rs4925 and GSTO2 rs2297235 SNPs on the clinical phenotype in SCA2 patients. 
      METHODS: A case-control study was performed in a sample of 120 SCA2 Cuban 
      patients and 100 healthy subjects. Age at onset, 60 degrees  Maximal Saccade Velocity and 
      SARA score were used as clinical markers. GSTO1 rs4925 and GSTO2 rs2297235 SNPs 
      were determined by PCR/RFLP. RESULTS: Distribution of the GSTO1 alleles and 
      genotypes was nearly equal between the control group and SCA2 patients. GSTO1 
      genotypes were not associated to clinical markers in SCA2 patients. Distribution 
      of the GSTO2 "G" allele and "AG" genotype differed significantly between SCA2 
      patients and controls. Symptomatic SCA2 individuals had a 2.29-fold higher chance 
      of carrying at least one "G" allele at GSTO2 rs2297235 than controls (OR=2.29, 
      95% CI: 1.29-4.04). GSTO2 genotypes were significantly associated to age at onset 
      (p=0.037) but not to 60 degrees  Maximal Saccade Velocity or SARA score in SCA2 patients. 
      CONCLUSION: The GSTO1 rs4925 polymorphism is not associated to SCA2. Meanwhile, 
      the GSTO2 rs2297235 "AG" genotype is associated to SCA2 but failed to show any 
      association with clinical markers, with the exception of a potential association 
      with the age at disease onset.

      sensory neuropathy.
PG  - e123
LID - e123
AB  - Spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) is a group of disorders characterized by 
      progressive ataxia caused by dysfunction and atrophy of the cerebellum or its 
      projections. Approximately one-third of SCD cases are familial SCD, the majority 
      of which are attributed to CAG triplet repeat expansions including 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, and dentate-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      triplet repeat number of the alleles representing complete penetrance varies 
      among diseases. Generally, there is a gap between the normal alleles and the 
      complete penetrance alleles. Rarely, intermediate alleles with the repeat numbers 
      between the abnormal and normal ranges are observed, although the implications of 
      these intermediate alleles remain ambiguous.

TI  - The Initial Symptom and Motor Progression in Spinocerebellar Ataxias.
PG  - 615-622
LID - 10.1007/s12311-016-0836-3 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study is to determine whether the initial symptom associates with 
      motor progression in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). SCAs are clinically 
      heterogeneous and the initial presentation may represent different subtypes of 
      SCA with different motor progression. We studied 317 participants with SCAs1, 2, 
      3, and 6 from the Clinical Research Consortium for SCAs (CRC-SCA) and repeatedly 
      measured the severity of ataxia for 2 years. SCA patients were divided into 
      gait-onset and non-gait-onset (speech, vision, and hand dexterity) groups based 
      on the initial presentation. In addition to demographic comparison, we employed 
      regression models to study ataxia progression in these two groups after adjusting 
      for age, sex, and pathological CAG repeats. The majority of SCA patients had gait 
      abnormality as an initial presentation. The pathological CAG repeat expansions 
      were similar between the gait-onset and non-gait-onset groups. In SCA1, 
      gait-onset group progressed slower than non-gait-onset group, while gait-onset 
      SCA6 group progressed faster than their counterpart. In addition, the disease 
      presented 9 years later for SCA2 gait-onset group than non-gait-onset group. 
      Initial symptoms of SCA3 did not influence age of onset or disease progression. 
      The initial symptom in each SCA has a different influence on age of onset and 
      motor progression. Therefore, gait and non-gait-onset groups of SCAs might 
      represent different subtypes of the diseases.

TI  - Regulation of mRNA Translation by MID1: A Common Mechanism of Expanded CAG Repeat 
      RNAs.
PG  - 226
LID - 226
AB  - Expansion of CAG repeats, which code for the disease-causing polyglutamine 
      protein, is a common feature in polyglutamine diseases. RNA-mediated mechanisms 
      that contribute to neuropathology in polyglutamine diseases are important. 
      RNA-toxicity describes a phenomenon by which the mutant CAG repeat RNA recruits 
      RNA-binding proteins, thereby leading to aberrant function. For example the MID1 
      protein binds to mutant huntingtin (HTT) RNA, which is linked to Huntington's 
      disease (HD), at its CAG repeat region and induces protein synthesis of mutant 
      protein. But is this mechanism specific to HD or is it a common mechanism in CAG 
      repeat expansion disorders? To answer this question, we have analyzed the 
      interaction between MID1 and three other CAG repeat mRNAs, Ataxin2 (ATXN2), 
      Ataxin3 (ATXN3), and Ataxin7 (ATXN7), that all differ in the sequence flanking 
      the CAG repeat. We show that ATXN2, ATXN3, and ATXN7 bind to MID1 in a CAG repeat 
      length-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that functionally, in line with 
      what we have previously observed for HTT, the binding of MID1 to ATXN2, ATXN3, 
      and ATXN7 mRNA induces protein synthesis in a repeat length-dependent manner. Our 
      data suggest that regulation of protein translation by the MID1 complex is a 
      common mechanism for CAG repeat containing mRNAs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene ataxin-2 (ATXN2). ATXN2 
      intermediate-length CAG expansions were identified as a risk factor for 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The ATXN2 CAG repeat is translated into 
      polyglutamine, and SCA2 pathogenesis has been thought to derive from ATXN2 
      protein containing an expanded polyglutamine tract. However, recent evidence of 
      bidirectional transcription at multiple CAG/CTG disease loci has led us to test 
      whether additional mechanisms of pathogenesis may contribute to SCA2. METHODS: In 
      this work, using human postmortem tissue, various cell models, and animal models, 
      we provide the first evidence that an antisense transcript at the SCA2 locus 
      contributes to SCA2 pathogenesis. RESULTS: We demonstrate the expression of a 
      transcript, containing the repeat as a CUG tract, derived from a gene (ATXN2-AS) 
      directly antisense to ATXN2. ATXN2-AS transcripts with normal and expanded CUG 
      repeats are expressed in human postmortem SCA2 brains, human SCA2 fibroblasts, 
      induced SCA2 pluripotent stem cells, SCA2 neural stem cells, and lymphoblastoid 
      lines containing an expanded ATXN2 allele associated with ALS. ATXN2-AS 
      transcripts with a CUG repeat expansion are toxic in an SCA2 cell model and form 
      RNA foci in SCA2 cerebellar Purkinje cells. Finally, we detected missplicing of 
      amyloid beta precursor protein and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 in SCA2 
      brains, consistent with findings in other diseases characterized by RNA-mediated 
      pathogenesis. INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that ATXN2-AS has a role in 
      SCA2 and possibly ALS pathogenesis, and may therefore provide a novel therapeutic 
      target for these diseases. Ann Neurol 2016;80:600-615.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The natural history of clinical symptoms in the spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCA)s has been well characterised. However there is little longitudinal 
      data comparing cognitive changes in the most common SCA subtypes over time. The 
      present study provides a preliminary longitudinal characterisation of the 
      clinical and cognitive profiles in patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7, 
      with the aim of elucidating the role of the cerebellum in cognition. METHODS: 13 
      patients with different SCAs all caused by CAG repeat expansion (SCA1, n = 2; 
      SCA2, n = 2; SCA3, n = 2; SCA6, n = 4; and SCA7, n = 3) completed a comprehensive 
      battery of cognitive and mood assessments at two time points, a mean of 
      7.35 years apart. All patients were evaluated clinically using the Scale for the 
      Rating and Assessment of Ataxia (SARA) and the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs 
      (INAS). Patients underwent structural MRI imaging at follow-up. RESULTS: Clinical 
      scale scores increased in all patients over time, most prominently in the SCA1 
      (SARA) and SCA3 (INAS) groups. New impairments on neuropsychological tests were 
      most commonly observed with executive functions, speed, attention, visual memory 
      and Theory of Mind. Results suggest possible differences in cognitive decline in 
      SCA subtypes, with the most rapid cognitive decline observed in the SCA1 
      patients, and the least in the SCA6 patients, congruent with observed patterns of 
      motor deterioration. Minimal changes in mood were observed, and MRI measures of 
      atrophy did not correlate with cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: As well as 
      increasing physical impairment, cognitive decline over time appears to be a 
      distinct aspect of the SCA phenotype, in keeping with the cerebellar 
      cognitive-affective syndrome. Our data suggest a trend of cognitive decline that 
      is different for each SCA subtype, and for the majority is related to the 
      severity of cerebellar motor impairment.

TI  - The most prevalent genetic cause of ALS-FTD, C9orf72 synergizes the toxicity of 
      ATXN2 intermediate polyglutamine repeats through the autophagy pathway.
PG  - 1406-8
LID - 10.1080/15548627.2016.1189070 [doi]
AB  - The most common genetic cause for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 
      frontotemporal dementia (ALS-FTD) is repeat expansion of a hexanucleotide 
      sequence (GGGGCC) within the C9orf72 genomic sequence. To elucidate the 
      functional role of C9orf72 in disease pathogenesis, we identified certain 
      molecular interactors of this factor. We determined that C9orf72 exists in a 
      complex with SMCR8 and WDR41 and that this complex acts as a GDP/GTP exchange 
      factor for RAB8 and RAB39, 2 RAB GTPases involved in macroautophagy/autophagy. 
      Consequently, C9orf72 depletion in neuronal cultures leads to accumulation of 
      unresolved aggregates of SQSTM1/p62 and phosphorylated TARDBP/TDP-43. However, 
      C9orf72 reduction does not lead to major neuronal toxicity, suggesting that a 
      second stress may be required to induce neuronal cell death. An intermediate size 
      of polyglutamine repeats within ATXN2 is an important genetic modifier of 
      ALS-FTD. We found that coexpression of intermediate polyglutamine repeats (30Q) 
      of ATXN2 combined with C9orf72 depletion increases the aggregation of ATXN2 and 
      neuronal toxicity. These results were confirmed in zebrafish embryos where 
      partial C9orf72 knockdown along with intermediate (but not normal) repeat 
      expansions in ATXN2 causes locomotion deficits and abnormal axonal projections 
      from spinal motor neurons. These results demonstrate that C9orf72 plays an 
      important role in the autophagy pathway while genetically interacting with 
      another major genetic risk factor, ATXN2, to contribute to ALS-FTD pathogenesis.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2: Measures of saccade changes improve power for 
      clinical trials.
PG  - 570-8
LID - 10.1002/mds.26532 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Saccadic eye movement abnormalities are common in patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, but it is unclear how these alterations progress 
      over time. The aim of this study was to assess the progression of saccade 
      involvement in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 patients, identify its main 
      determinants, and evaluate its usefulness as outcome measures in clinical trials. 
      METHODS: A prospective 5-year follow-up study was performed with 30 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 patients and their matched healthy controls, who 
      were evaluated a total of four times by clinical and electrooculographical 
      assessments of horizontal saccades and by the scoring of ataxia. RESULTS: 
      Patients showed significant decreases in saccade peak velocity and saccade 
      accuracy as well as increases of saccadic latency during the follow-up period. 
      Annual progression rates were significantly higher in patients compared to 
      controls. Faster progression rates of saccade slowing were associated with higher 
      trinucleotide cytosine-adenine-guanine repeat expansions. Sample-size estimates 
      for two-arm trials would require 19 patients per group to detect a 50% reduction 
      in disease progression using saccade peak velocity as outcome variable, but 44 
      and 124 patients using saccade latency and accuracy, respectively (power, 80%; 
      alpha = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Electrooculographical measures of saccade changes are 
      useful for the objective quantification of disease course in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 2. The progression rate of saccade slowing is influenced by the 
      expansion size, providing novel insight into the cumulative polyglutamine 
      neurotoxicity, and supporting the usefulness of saccade peak velocity as a 
      sensitive biomarker during the natural history of the disease, and as suitable 
      outcome measure for therapeutic trials.

TI  - Large-scale screening in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis identifies 
      genetic modifiers in C9orf72 repeat carriers.

AB  - Sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is considered to be a complex 
      disease with multiple genetic risk factors contributing to the pathogenesis. 
      Identification of genetic risk factors that co-occur frequently could provide 
      relevant insight into underlying mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration. To 
      dissect the genetic architecture of sporadic ALS, we undertook a large sequencing 
      study in 755 apparently sporadic ALS cases and 959 controls, analyzing 10 ALS 
      genes: SOD1, C9orf72, TARDBP, FUS, ANG, CHMP2B, ATXN2, NIPA1, SMN1, and UNC13A. 
      We observed sporadic cases with multiple genetic risk variants in 4.1% compared 
      with 1.3% in controls. The overall difference was not in excess of what is to be 
      expected by chance (binomial test, p = 0.59). We did, however, observe a higher 
      frequency than expected of C9orf72 repeat carriers with co-occurring 
      susceptibility variants (ATXN2, NIPA1, and SMN1; p = 0.001), which is mainly 
      because of the co-occurrence of NIPA1 repeats in 15% of C9orf72 repeat carriers 
      (p = 0.006).

TI  - ATNX2 is not a regulatory gene in Italian amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients 
      with C9ORF72 GGGGCC expansion.

AB  - There are indications that both familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 
      sporadic ALS phenotype and prognosis are partly regulated by genetic and 
      environmental factors, supporting the theory that ALS is a multifactorial 
      disease. The aim of this article was to assess the role of ATXN2 intermediate 
      length repeats in a large series of Italian and Sardinian ALS patients and 
      controls carrying a pathogenetic C9ORF72 GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat. A total of 
      1972 ALS cases were identified through the database of the Italian ALS Genetic 
      consortium, a collaborative effort including 18 ALS centers throughout Italy. The 
      study population included: (1) 276 Italian and 57 Sardinian ALS cases who carried 
      the C9ORF72 expansion; (2) 1340 Italian and 299 Sardinian ALS cases not carrying 
      the C9ORF72 expansion. A total of healthy 1043 controls were also assessed. Most 
      Italian and Sardinian cases and controls were homozygous for 22/22 or 23/23 
      repeats or heterozygous for 22/23 repeats of the ATXN2 gene. ATXN2 intermediate 
      length repeats alleles (>/=28) were detected in 3 (0.6%) Italian ALS cases carrying 
      the C9ORF72 expansion, in none of the Sardinian ALS cases carrying the expansion, 
      in 60 (4.3%) Italian cases not carrying the expansion, and in 6 (2.0%) Sardinian 
      ALS cases without C9ORF72 expansion. Intermediate length repeat alleles were 
      found in 12 (1.5%) Italian controls and 1 (0.84%) Sardinian controls. Therefore, 
      ALS patients with C9ORF72 expansion showed a lower frequency of ATXN2 polyQ 
      intermediate length repeats than both controls (Italian cases, p = 0.137; 
      Sardinian cases, p = 0.0001) and ALS patients without C9ORF72 expansion (Italian 
      cases, p = 0.005; Sardinian cases, p = 0.178). In our large study on Italian and 
      Sardinian ALS patients with C9ORF72 GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion, 
      compared to age-, gender- and ethnic-matched controls, ATXN2 polyQ intermediate 
      length does not represent a modifier of ALS risk, differently from non-C9ORF72 
      mutated patients.

TI  - Cerebellar neuronal loss in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases with ATXN2 
      intermediate repeat expansions.
PG  - 295-305
LID - 10.1002/ana.24565 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite evidence suggesting that the cerebellum may be targeted in 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), particularly in cases with repeat expansions 
      in the ATXN2 and C9ORF72 genes, the integrity of cerebellar neurons has yet to be 
      examined. The present study undertakes a histopathological analysis to assess the 
      impact of these repeat expansions on cerebellar neurons and determine whether 
      similar cerebellar pathology occurs in sporadic disease. METHODS: Purkinje and 
      granule cells were quantified in the vermis and lateral cerebellar hemispheres of 
      ALS cases with repeat expansions in the ATXN2 and C9ORF72 genes, sporadic 
      disease, and sporadic progressive muscular atrophy with only lower motor neuron 
      degeneration. RESULTS: ALS cases with intermediate repeat expansions in the ATXN2 
      gene demonstrate a significant loss in Purkinje cells in the cerebellar vermis 
      only. Despite ALS cases with expansions in the C9ORF72 gene having the highest 
      burden of inclusion pathology, no neuronal loss was observed in this group. 
      Neuronal numbers were also unchanged in sporadic ALS and sporadic PMA cases. 
      INTERPRETATION: The present study has established a selective loss of Purkinje 
      cells in the cerebellar vermis of ALS cases with intermediate repeat expansions 
      in the ATXN2 gene, suggesting a divergent pathogenic mechanism independent of 
      upper and lower motor neuron degeneration in ALS. We discuss these findings in 
      the context of large repeat expansions in ATXN2 and spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      2, providing evidence that intermediate repeats in ATXN2 cause significant, 
      albeit less substantial, spinocerebellar damage compared with longer repeats in 
      ATXN2.

AB  - Our objective was to search for mutations in genes SOD1, TARDBP, C9orf72, ANG, 
      ATXN2 and VEGF in Russian patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A 
      group of 208 Russian patients with ALS was examined. Molecular genetic analysis 
      was conducted using direct sequencing, fragment analysis, and real-time PCR. We 
      found eight different point mutations in the SOD1 gene, with the frequency of 
      mutations being 50% in familial ALS and 3% in sporadic ALS. No mutations were 
      found in exon 6 of the TARDBP gene; however, deletion c.715-126delG in intron 5 
      of TARDBP was over-represented in ALS patients compared to controls (38% vs. 
      26.6%; chi(2 )= 13.17; p = 0.002). Hexanucleotide repeat expansion of the C9orf72 
      gene was revealed in 2.5% of sporadic ALS patients. Mutations in the ANG gene 
      were identified in 1.5% of sporadic ALS patients. The presence of an intermediate 
      number (28-33) of GAC repeats in the ATXN2 gene was observed significantly more 
      often in the study group compared to the control group (5% vs. 1.7%; chi(2 )= 3.89; 
      p = 0.0486). In the cohort examined, we found an association between the disease 
      and the risk A-allele and the A/A genotype at the -2578capital ES, Cyrillic/capital A, Cyrillic locus of the VEGF 
      gene. In conclusion, we determined for the first time the genetic basis of ALS in 
      a Russian population.

TI  - Long-term disease progression in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, and 6: a 
      longitudinal cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias are dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      diseases. As potential treatments for these diseases are being developed, precise 
      knowledge of their natural history is needed. We aimed to study the long-term 
      disease progression of the most common spinocerebellar ataxias: SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, 
      and SCA6. Furthermore, we aimed to establish the order and occurrence of 
      non-ataxia symptoms, and identify predictors of disease progression. METHODS: In 
      this longitudinal cohort study (EUROSCA), we enrolled men and women with positive 
      genetic testing for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 and with progressive, otherwise 
      unexplained ataxia who were aged 18 years or older from 17 ataxia referral 
      centres in ten European countries. Patients were seen every year for 3 years, and 
      at irregular intervals thereafter. The primary outcome was the scale for the 
      assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA), and the inventory of non-ataxia signs 
      (INAS). We used linear mixed models to analyse progression. To account for 
      dropouts, we applied a pattern-mixture model. This study is registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02440763. FINDINGS: Between July 1, 2005, and Aug 
      31, 2006, 526 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 were enrolled. We analysed 
      data for 462 patients with at least one follow-up visit. Median observation time 
      was 49 months (IQR 35-72). SARA progression data were best fitted with a linear 
      model in all genotypes. Annual SARA score increase was 2.11 (SE 0.12) in patients 
      with SCA1, 1.49 (0.07) in patients with SCA2, 1.56 (0.08) in patients with SCA3, 
      and 0.80 (0.09) in patients with SCA6. The increase of the number of non-ataxia 
      signs reached a plateau in SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3. In patients with SCA6, the 
      number of non-ataxia symptoms increased linearly, but more slowly than in 
      patients with SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 (p<0.0001). Factors that were associated with 
      faster progression of the SARA score were short duration of follow-up (p=0.0179), 
      older age at inclusion (0.04 [SE 0.02] per additional year; p=0.0476), and longer 
      repeat expansions (0.06 [SE 0.02] per additional repeat unit; p=0.0128) in SCA1, 
      short duration of follow-up (p<0.0001), lower age at onset (-0.02 [SE 0.01] per 
      additional year; p=0.0014), and lower baseline SARA score (-0.02 [SE 0.01] per 
      additional SARA point; p=0.0083) in SCA2, and lower baseline SARA score (-0.03 
      [SE 0.01] per additional SARA point; p=0.0195) in SCA6. In SCA3, we did not 
      identify factors that affected progression of the SARA score. INTERPRETATION: Our 
      study provides quantitative data on the progression of the most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxias based on a follow-up period that exceeds those of 
      previous studies. Our data could prove useful for sample size calculation and 
      patient stratification in interventional trials. FUNDING: EU FP6 (EUROSCA),

AB  - BACKGROUND: About 50 % of Thai patients with adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) was Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6. The author 
      investigated further on less common SCAs in the patients without any known 
      mutations. METHODS: DNA samples of 82 index patients who were genetically 
      excluded MJD, SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) were examined. Analysis of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, SCA17 and SCA19 genes were 
      comprehensively performed. Normal range of trinucleotide repeat expansion sizes 
      of TATA-box-binding protein gene (TBP) were also determined in 374 control 
      subjects. RESULTS: Eight patients carried >/=42 CAG/CAA repeat allele in the TBP 
      consistent with SCA17. The pathological repeat alleles ranged from 42 to 57 
      repeats. All patients had significant degree of cognitive dysfunction. Other 
      non-ataxic phenotypes comprised of parkinsonism, chorea, dystonia and myoclonus. 
      A sporadic patient carried a heterozygous 41-repeat allele developed chronic 
      progressive cerebellar degeneration commenced at the age of 28 years. Whilst, 2 % 
      of the control subjects (8/374) carried the 41-repeat allele. Five of the 
      carriers were re-examined, and revealed that four of them had parkinsonism and/or 
      cognitive impairment without cerebellar signs. Analysis of other types of SCAs 
      was all negative. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA17 and SCA19 in Thais. SCA17 appears to be an important cause of ataxia in 
      Thailand. Although, the pathological cut-off point of the TBP repeat allele 
      remains unclear, the finding suggests that the 41-repeat may be a pathological 
      allele resulting late-onset or mild phenotype. Apart from ataxia, cognitive 
      impairment and parkinsonism may be clinical presentations in these carriers.

TI  - No parkinsonism in SCA2 and SCA3 despite severe neurodegeneration of the 
      dopaminergic substantia nigra.
PG  - 3316-26

AB  - See Klockgether (doi:10.1093/awv253) for a scientific commentary on this 
      article.The spinocerebellar ataxias types 2 (SCA2) and 3 (SCA3) are autosomal 
      dominantly inherited cerebellar ataxias which are caused by CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat expansions in the coding regions of the disease-specific genes. Although 
      previous post-mortem studies repeatedly revealed a consistent neurodegeneration 
      of the dopaminergic substantia nigra in patients with SCA2 and with SCA3, 
      parkinsonian motor features evolve only rarely. As the pathophysiological 
      mechanism how SCA2 and SCA3 patients do not exhibit parkinsonism is still 
      enigmatic, we performed a positron emission tomography and a post-mortem study of 
      two independent cohorts of SCA2 and SCA3 patients with and without parkinsonian 
      features. Positron emission tomography revealed a significant reduction of 
      dopamine transporter levels in the striatum as well as largely unaffected 
      postsynaptic striatal D2 receptors. In spite of this remarkable pathology in the 
      motor mesostriatal pathway, only 4 of 19 SCA2 and SCA3 patients suffered from 
      parkinsonism. The post-mortem investigation revealed, in addition to an extensive 
      neuronal loss in the dopaminergic substantia nigra of all patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia, a consistent affection of the thalamic ventral anterior 
      and ventral lateral nuclei, the pallidum and the cholinergic pedunculopontine 
      nucleus. With the exception of a single patient with SCA3 who suffered from 
      parkinsonian motor features during his lifetime, the subthalamic nucleus 
      underwent severe neuronal loss, which was clearly more severe in its motor 
      territory than in its limbic or associative territories. Our observation that 
      lesions of the motor territory of the subthalamic nucleus were consistently 
      associated with the prevention of parkinsonism in our SCA2 and SCA3 patients 
      matches the clinical experience that selective targeting of the motor territory 
      of the subthalamic nucleus by focal lesions or deep brain stimulation can 
      ameliorate parkinsonian motor features and is likely to counteract the 
      manifestation of parkinsonism in SCA2 and SCA3 despite a severe neurodegeneration 
      of the dopaminergic substantia nigra.

LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000002016 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aim to clarify the pathogenic role of intermediate size repeat 
      expansions of SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 as risk factors for idiopathic 
      Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: We invited researchers from the Genetic 
      Epidemiology of Parkinson's Disease Consortium to participate in the study. There 
      were 12,346 cases and 8,164 controls genotyped, for a total of 4 repeats within 
      the SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 genes. Fixed- and random-effects models were used 
      to estimate the summary risk estimates for the genes. We investigated 
      between-study heterogeneity and heterogeneity between different ethnic 
      populations. RESULTS: We did not observe any definite pathogenic repeat 
      expansions for SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 genes in patients with idiopathic PD 
      from Caucasian and Asian populations. Furthermore, overall analysis did not 
      reveal any significant association between intermediate repeats and PD. The 
      effect estimates (odds ratio) ranged from 0.93 to 1.01 in the overall cohort for 
      the SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 loci. CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not support a 
      major role for definite pathogenic repeat expansions in SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and 
      SCA17 genes for idiopathic PD. Thus, results of this large study do not support 
      diagnostic screening of SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 gene repeats in the common 
      idiopathic form of PD. Likewise, this largest multicentered study performed to 
      date excludes the role of intermediate repeats of these genes as a risk factor 
      for PD.

TI  - Motor neurone disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis associated with 
      intermediate-length CAG repeat expansions in Ataxin-2 does not have 1C2-positive 
      polyglutamine inclusions.
PG  - 377-89

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intermediate-length cytosine-adenine-guanine repeat expansions in the 
      ATXN2 gene (which encodes for Ataxin-2 protein) have been linked to increased 
      risk for motor neurone disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We screened 
      DNA from cases for which we had post-mortem brain tissue to enable 
      characterization of the neuropathology associated with this mutation. METHODS: 
      Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing of DNA from frozen brain tissue on a 
      cohort of 178 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) autopsy cases from the north of 
      England and 159 controls was performed. This was followed by tinctorial staining 
      and immunohistochemistry (including for Ataxin-2) on selected blocks from ALS 
      cases with intermediate-length expansions (ATXN2-ALS), sporadic ALS cases and 
      neurologically healthy controls. RESULTS: Four ALS cases with intermediate-length 
      CAG repeat expansions within ATXN2 were identified. One such case also had a 
      mutation of the C9ORF72 gene. All had lower motor neurone depletion, and three 
      out of four cases had transactive response DNA binding protein 43 
      (TDP-43)-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (predominantly skein-like). No 
      inclusions of aggregated polyglutamine proteins were identified. Ataxin-2 protein 
      expression was largely granular and cytoplasmic with the most prominent staining 
      observed in larger neurones. Ataxin-2 staining was variable both within and 
      between cases, but no staining pattern that was specific for cases with ATXN2 
      mutations was seen. CONCLUSIONS: Intermediate expansions of the CAG repeat in 
      ATXN2 are associated with ALS. They are mostly associated with TDP-43 
      proteinopathy, but not with 1C2-positive polyglutamine inclusions. In the nervous 
      system, Ataxin-2 protein expression is predominantly seen in large neurones. 
      There is no consistent histopathological hallmark that is unique to ATXN2-ALS.

LID - e0128769
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a progressive autosomal dominant disorder 
      caused by the expansion of a CAG tract in the ATXN2 gene. The SCA2 disease 
      phenotype is characterized by cerebellar atrophy, gait ataxia, and slow saccades. 
      ATXN2 mutation causes gains of toxic and normal functions of the ATXN2 gene 
      product, ataxin-2, and abnormally slow Purkinje cell firing frequency. Previously 
      we investigated features of ATXN2 controlling expression and noted expression 
      differences for ATXN2 constructs with varying CAG lengths, suggestive of repeat 
      associated non-AUG translation (RAN translation). To determine whether RAN 
      translation occurs for ATXN2 we assembled various ATXN2 constructs with ATXN2 
      tagged by luciferase, HA or FLAG tags, driven by the CMV promoter or the ATXN2 
      promoter. Luciferase expression from ATXN2-luciferase constructs lacking the 
      ATXN2 start codon was weak vs AUG translation, regardless of promoter type, and 
      did not increase with longer CAG repeat lengths. RAN translation was detected on 
      western blots by the anti-polyglutamine antibody 1C2 for constructs driven by the 
      CMV promoter but not the ATXN2 promoter, and was weaker than AUG translation. 
      Strong RAN translation was also observed when driving the ATXN2 sequence with the 
      CMV promoter with ATXN2 sequence downstream of the CAG repeat truncated to 18 bp 
      in the polyglutamine frame but not in the polyserine or polyalanine frames. Our 
      data demonstrate that ATXN2 RAN translation is weak compared to AUG translation 
      and is dependent on ATXN2 sequences flanking the CAG repeat.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association of repeat expansion size in 10 common 
      degenerative hereditary ataxia genes with essential tremor. These genes were 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 
      (CACNA1A), SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), 
      SCA-17 (TBP) and dentatorubral-pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA) (ATN1). METHODS: 
      Genetic analysis of repeat size in 10 degenerative hereditary ataxia loci was 
      performed in 323 essential tremor patients and 299 controls enrolled at Columbia 
      University. To test for differences in the allele distribution between patients 
      and controls, a CLUMP analysis was performed. RESULTS: None of the essential 
      tremor patients had a repeat expansion in the intermediate or pathogenic range. 
      Significant differences in the distribution of repeats in the 'normal' range for 
      SCA2 and SCA8 (both p </= 0.02) were observed between essential tremor patients and 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      SCA loci are not associated with essential tremor.

PG  - 165-73

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are characterized by autosomal dominantly 
      inherited progressive ataxia but are clinically heterogeneous due to variable 
      involvement of non-cerebellar parts of the nervous system. Non-cerebellar 
      symptoms contribute significantly to the burden of SCAs, may guide the clinician 
      to the underlying genetic subtype, and might be useful markers to monitor 
      disease. Peripheral neuropathy is frequently observed in SCA, but 
      subtype-specific features and subclinical manifestations have rarely been 
      evaluated. We performed a multicenter nerve conduction study with 162 patients 
      with genetically confirmed SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6. The study proved 
      peripheral nerves to be involved in the neurodegenerative process in 82 % of 
      SCA1, 63 % of SCA2, 55 % of SCA3, and 22 % of SCA6 patients. Most patients of all 
      subtypes revealed affection of both sensory and motor fibers. Neuropathy was most 
      frequently of mixed type with axonal and demyelinating characteristics in all SCA 
      subtypes. However, nerve conduction velocities of SCA1 patients were slower 
      compared to other genotypes. SCA6 patients revealed less axonal damage than 
      patients with other subtypes. No influence of CAG repeat length or biometric 
      determinants on peripheral neuropathy could be identified in SCA1, SCA3, and 
      SCA6. In SCA2, earlier onset and more severe ataxia were associated with 
      peripheral neuropathy. We proved peripheral neuropathy to be a frequent site of 
      the neurodegenerative process in all common SCA subtypes. Since damage to 
      peripheral nerves is readily assessable by electrophysiological means, nerve 
      conduction studies should be performed in a longitudinal approach to assess these 
      parameters as potential progression markers.

TI  - SCA2 predictive testing in Cuba: challenging concepts and protocol evolution.
PG  - 265-73
LID - 10.1007/s12687-015-0226-4 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN2 gene. Cuba has the highest prevalence (6.57 
      cases/10(5) inhabitants) of SCA2 in the world. The existence of 753 affected 
      individuals and 7173 relatives at risk prompted the development in 2001 of the 
      first predictive testing program in the country. The medical records of over 1193 
      individuals, who requested the test within a 13-year period, were analyzed 
      retrospectively. The presymptomatic and the prenatal tests had uptake rates of 
      43.4 and 23.9 %, respectively. Several ethical challenges resulted from this 
      program. These include the following: (1) withdrawal due to the initial 
      protocol's length; (2) the request to participate by 16 at-risk adolescents; (3) 
      the decision made by ten out of 33 couples with a test-positive fetus to carry 
      the pregnancy to term, leading to de facto predictive testing of minors; (4) the 
      elevated frequency of the ATXN2 gene large normal alleles (>/=23 to 31 repeats) in 
      the reference population. These issues have led to major changes in the 
      guidelines of the predictive testing protocol: (1) the protocol length was 
      shortened; (2) the inclusion criteria were expanded to reach at-risk adolescents 
      with an interest in prenatal diagnosis; (3) interdisciplinary follow-up was 
      offered to families in which test-positive fetuses were not aborted; (4) prenatal 
      testing was made available to carriers of large normal alleles with >/=27 CAG 
      repeats. The profiles of the participants were similar to those reported for 
      other predictive testing programs for conditions like Huntington disease and 
      familial adenomatous polyposis. The genetic counseling practices at the community 
      level, the ample health education provided to the at-risk population, together 
      with multidisciplinary and specialized attention to the affected families, are 
      lessons from the Cuban experience that can be relevant for other international 
      teams conducting predictive testing for other late-onset neurodegenerative 
      disorders.

      ATXN2 PolyQ expansions, but only FBXW8 expression is dysregulated.

AB  - The involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in the course of various 
      age-associated neurodegenerative diseases is well established. The single RING 
      finger type E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase PARK2 is mutated in a Parkinson's disease 
      (PD) variant and was found to interact with ATXN2, a protein where polyglutamine 
      expansions cause Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) or increase the risk for 
      Levodopa-responsive PD and for the motor neuron disease Amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS). We previously reported evidence for a transcriptional induction 
      of the multi-subunit RING finger Skp1/Cul/F-box (SCF) type E3 ubiquitin-protein 
      ligase complex component FBXW8 in global microarray profiling of ATXN2-expansion 
      mouse cerebellum and demonstrated its role for ATXN2 degradation in vitro. Now, 
      we documented co-localization in vitro and co-immunoprecipitations both in vitro 
      and in vivo, which indicate associations of FBXW8 with ATXN2 and PARK2. Both 
      FBXW8 and PARK2 proteins are driven into insolubility by expanded ATXN2. Whereas 
      the FBXW8 transcript upregulation by ATXN2- expansion was confirmed also in qPCR 
      of skin fibroblasts and blood samples of SCA2 patients, a FBXW8 expression 
      dysregulation was not observed in ATXN2-deficient mice, nor was a PARK2 
      transcript dysregulation observed in any samples. Jointly, all available data 
      suggest that the degradation of wildtype and mutant ATXN2 is dependent on FBXW8, 
      and that ATXN2 accumulation selectively modulates FBXW8 levels, while PARK2 might 
      act indirectly through FBXW8. The effects of ATXN2-expansions on FBXW8 expression 
      in peripheral tissues like blood may become useful for clinical diagnostics.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are 
      neurodegenerative disorders, caused or modified by an unstable CAG-repeat 
      expansion in the SCA2 gene, which encodes a polyglutamine (polyQ) domain 
      expansion in ataxin-2 (ATXN2). ATXN2 is an RNA-binding protein and interacts with 
      the poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1, localizing to ribosomes at the rough 
      endoplasmic reticulum. Under cell stress, ATXN2, PABPC1 and small ribosomal 
      subunits are relocated to stress granules, where mRNAs are protected from 
      translation and from degradation. It is unknown whether ATXN2 associates 
      preferentially with specific mRNAs or how it modulates RNA processing. Here, we 
      investigated the RNA profile of the liver and cerebellum from Atxn2 knockout 
      (Atxn2 (-/-)) mice at two adult ages, employing oligonucleotide microarrays. 
      Prominent increases were observed for Lsm12/Paip1 (>2-fold), translation 
      modulators known as protein interactor/competitor of ATXN2 and for Plin3/Mttp 
      (>1.3-fold), known as apolipoprotein modulators in agreement with the 
      hepatosteatosis phenotype of the Atxn2 (-/-) mice. Consistent modest 
      upregulations were also observed for many factors in the ribosome and the 
      translation/secretion apparatus. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR in liver 
      tissue validated >1.2-fold upregulations for the ribosomal biogenesis modulator 
      Nop10, the ribosomal components Rps10, Rps18, Rpl14, Rpl18, Gnb2l1, the 
      translation initiation factors Eif2s2, Eif3s6, Eif4b, Pabpc1 and the rER 
      translocase factors Srp14, Ssr1, Sec61b. Quantitative immunoblots substantiated 
      the increased abundance of NOP10, RPS3, RPS6, RPS10, RPS18, GNB2L1 in SDS protein 
      fractions, and of PABPC1. In mouse embryonal fibroblasts, ATXN2 absence also 
      enhanced phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 during growth stimulation, 
      while impairing the rate of overall protein synthesis rates, suggesting a block 
      between the enhanced translation drive and the impaired execution. Thus, the 
      physiological role of ATXN2 subtly modifies the abundance of cellular translation 
      factors as well as global translation.

TI  - Identification of 46 CAG repeats within PPP2R2B as probably the shortest 
      pathogenic allele for SCA12.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) is predominantly characterized 
      by action tremor, followed by slowly progressive cerebellar dysfunction. It is a 
      very rare disorder and only identified in certain countries so far. The current 
      appreciation for phenotypic and genotypic features of SCA12 is still limited. 
      METHODS: We investigated CAG copies within PPP2R2B in 29 patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia who are excluded from the most common SCA subtypes 
      including SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6. The medical data of patients carrying 
      abnormal expanded PPP2R2B allele were reviewed and summarized. RESULTS: We found 
      that 3 patients carried 53, 46 and 54 CAG repeats respectively, while the other 
      26 cases harbored CAG repeats less than 30. The probably shortest pathogenic 
      allele of 46 repeats was detected in one kindred typically experiencing action 
      tremor. Additionally, compared to the prominent cerebellar ataxia, nystagmus and 
      dysphagia seem to be rare in our SCA12 patients. CONCLUSIONS: SCA12 might not be 
      as rare in Chinese as previously assumed. The identification of the shortest 
      pathogenic allele helps to define the minimal limit implicated in the disease 
      onset. Moreover, the disease manifestations distinct from other SCA subtypes 
      could help clinicians to provide timely genetic counseling.

TI  - ATXN2 polyQ intermediate repeats are a modifier of ALS survival.
PG  - 251-8
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000001159 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the frequency and clinical characteristics of patients with 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with intermediate-length (CAG) expansion 
      (encoding 27-33 glutamines, polyQ) in the ATXN2 gene, in a population-based 
      cohort of Italian patients with ALS (discovery cohort), and to replicate the 
      findings in an independent cohort of consecutive patients from an ALS tertiary 
      center (validation cohort). METHODS: PolyQ repeats were assessed in 672 patients 
      with incident ALS in Piemonte and Valle d'Aosta regions, Italy, in the 2007-2012 
      period (discovery cohort); controls were 509 neurologically healthy age- and 
      sex-matched subjects resident in the study area. The validation cohort included 
      661 patients with ALS consecutively seen between 2001 and 2013 in the ALS Clinic 
      Center of the Catholic University in Rome, Italy. RESULTS: In the discovery 
      cohort, the frequency of >/=31 polyQ ATNX2 repeats was significantly more common in 
      ALS cases (19 patients vs 1 control, p = 0.0001; odds ratio 14.8, 95% confidence 
      interval 1.9-110.8). Patients with an increased number of polyQ repeats had a 
      shorter survival than those with <31 repeats (median survival, polyQ >/=31, 1.8 
      years, interquartile range [IQR] 1.3-2.2; polyQ <31, 2.7 years, IQR 1.6-5.1; p = 
      0.001). An increased number of polyQ repeats remained independently significant 
      at multivariable analysis. In the validation cohort, patients with >/=31 polyQ 
      repeats had a shorter survival than those with <31 repeats (median survival, 
      polyQ >/=31, 2.0 years, IQR 1.5-3.4; polyQ <31, 3.2 years, IQR 2.0-6.4; p = 0.007). 
      CONCLUSIONS: ATXN2 polyQ intermediate-length repeat is a modifier of ALS 
      survival. Disease-modifying therapies targeted to ATXN2 represent a promising 
      therapeutic approach for ALS.

AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that are related 
      to at least 36 different genetic loci; they are clinically characterized by 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia and are frequently accompanied by other 
      neurological and non-neurological manifestations. The relative frequency of SCA 
      varies greatly among different regions, presumably because of a founder effect or 
      local ethnicities. Between July 1998 and May 2012, we investigated 320 Brazilian 
      patients with an SCA phenotype who belonged to 150 unrelated families with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and 23 sporadic patients from 13 Brazilian 
      states. A total of 265 patients (82.8%) belonging to 131 unrelated families 
      (87.3%) were found to have a definite mutation, and SCA3 accounted for most of 
      the familial cases (70.7%), followed by SCA7 (6%), SCA1 (5.3%), SCA2 (2.7%), SCA6 
      (1.3%), SCA8 (0.7%) and SCA10 (0.7%). In the Ribeirao Preto mesoregion, which is 
      located in the northeast part of Sao Paulo State, the prevalence of SCA3 was 
      approximately 5 per 100,000 inhabitants, which is the highest prevalence found in 
      Brazil. No mutation was found in the SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA genes, and all the 
      sporadic cases remained without a molecular diagnosis. This study further 
      characterizes the spectrum of SCA mutations found in Brazilian patients, which 
      suggests the existence of regional differences and demonstrates the expansion of 
      the SCA8 locus in Brazilian families.

TI  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis risk for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 ATXN2 CAG 
      repeat alleles: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 1529-34
LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2014.2082 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Repeats of CAG in the ataxin 2 gene (ATXN2) in the long-normal range 
      (sometimes referred to as intermediate) have been identified as modifiers of 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) risk. Prior studies have used thresholding 
      considering various cutoffs for ATXN2 repeat length. OBJECTIVE: To calculate 
      association between ATXN2 CAG repeat alleles and increased risk of ALS across 
      multiple ethnic groups. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE database was searched for 
      studies published by December 29, 2013, reporting ATXN2 CAG repeat length in 
      patients with ALS and controls. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they 
      reported original data on relative risks or odds ratios (ORs) from ALS and 
      control populations for individual ATXN2 alleles. Review articles that reported 
      no new data were not included in the analysis. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: 
      Analysis of allele distribution was performed to ensure that all studies followed 
      identical allele sizing. The ORs, 95% confidence intervals, and population 
      attributable risk percentages were calculated according to standard procedures. 
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Occurrence of ALS associated with ATXN2 repeat 
      alleles, expressed as ORs. RESULTS: Nine studies were analyzed, including 7505 
      controls and 6151 sporadic ALS cases. The ALS and control cohorts were recruited 
      from different geographical and ethnic regions including the United States, 
      French Canada/Canada, Belgium and the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, mainland 
      China, Turkey, and Flanders-Belgium. The ATXN2 CAG repeat lengths ranged from 13 
      to 39 in patients with ALS and from 13 to 34 in controls. The ORs were less than 
      1.00 for alleles with 25 to 28 repeats. The OR was 1.55 for 30 repeats, but this 
      elevation was not statistically significant (95% CI, 0.88-2.73). The ORs were 
      2.70 (95% CI, 1.47-4.93) for 31 CAG repeats, 11.09 (95% CI, 4.16-29.57) for 32 
      repeats, and 5.76 (95% CI, 1.79-18.57) for 33 repeats. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      In contrast to prior studies with smaller numbers, risk for ALS associated with 
      long-normal alleles is complex. Alleles with 27 and 28 repeats lower ALS risk 
      slightly. The risk for ALS increases beginning with 29 repeats and reaches a 
      maximum at 32 and 33 repeats. Of note, alleles with repeats of these lengths are 
      known to be predisposed to meiotic expansion to full-penetrance mutant alleles. 
      In patients with ALS, alleles with 31 to 33 repeats may have undergone 
      preferential expansion in motor neurons during mitosis or DNA repair. Our 
      meta-analysis provides a framework for counseling individuals with long-normal 
      ATXN2 repeats.

TI  - Executive deficit in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 is related to expanded CAG

AB  - Although antisaccadic task is a sensitive research tool in psychopathology, it 
      has not been systematically studied in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      2 (SCA2). To identify putative biomarkers of executive dysfunction in SCA2 we 
      assessed the antisaccade performance in 41 SCA2 patients and their sex-and-age 
      matched controls using an electronystagmography device. We studied the 
      relationship between findings in the antisaccade task and CAG repeat length and 
      motor function as assessed using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of 
      Ataxia (SARA), Nine-Hole Pegboard Test and a validated battery for executive 
      dysfunctions. SCA2 patients showed a significant increase of inhibition and 
      omission antisaccadic error rates, decrease of corrected antisaccadic errors and 
      prolongation of antisaccadic latency and antisaccadic correction latency. 
      Multiple regression predictions identified the expanded CAG repeat as a 
      significant contributing factor on inhibition antisaccadic error rate and 
      percentage of corrected antisaccadic errors. Impaired antisaccadic performance 
      was associated to higher Stroop interference task and verbal fluency test 
      deficits. In conclusion, antisaccadic eye movement abnormalities are a newly 
      recognized association with the genetic abnormality in SCA2 and correlate with 
      executive dysfunction in SCA2. Antisaccade parameters are a promising source of 
      cognitive biomarkers for exploring the disease pathophysiology, and assessing the 
      efficacy of therapeutic options.

AB  - CAG expansion within the exon 1 of ataxin-2 (ATXN2) gene responsible for 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-2 (SCA2) has been reported to cause pure parkinsonism and 
      other neurodegenerative disorders. However, it remains unclear whether CAG 
      expansion is the only cause for SCA2 and its clinical alternatives, and whether 
      extra mutations exist to modify the phenotypic diversity. To address this, we 
      have conducted fine genetic mapping and exome sequencing for a large Chinese SCA2 
      pedigree predominantly manifesting parkinsonism (called SCA2-P). In addition, we 
      compared the CAG expansions between the SCA2-P and 16 SCA2 families presenting as 
      pure ataxia (SCA2-A). As a result, CAG repeat expansions, ranging from 37 to 40 
      copies, were detected among 10 affected and 8 nonsymptomatic members of the 
      SCA2-P family. The CAG repeats in the diseased alleles were interrupted by CAA in 
      the 3'-end. In contrast, CAG expansion ranging from 36 to 54 without CAA 
      interruption was detected in all probands of the SCA2-A families. Genetic mapping 
      located the SCA2-P pedigree on 12q24.21, which spans the ATXN2 gene. Exome 
      sequencing for 3 patients and 1 normal member revealed no extra mutations in this 
      family. In addition, by genotyping single-nucleotide polymorphisms around SCA2 
      locus, we have excluded the existence of haplotypes predisposing different 
      patterns of CAG expansion. These results demonstrate that the ATXN2 CAG expansion 
      is the sole causative mutation responsible for SCA2-P, and that genetic modifiers 
      may not be the major cause of the phenotypic diversity of SCA2.

TI  - Poly-A binding protein-1 localization to a subset of TDP-43 inclusions in 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis occurs more frequently in patients harboring an

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset motor neuron disease in 
      which the loss of spinal cord motor neurons leads to paralysis and death within a 
      few years of clinical disease onset. In almost all cases of ALS, transactive 
      response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) forms cytoplasmic neuronal 
      inclusions. A second causative gene for a subset of ALS is fused in sarcoma, an 
      RNA binding protein that also forms cytoplasmic inclusions in spinal cord motor 
      neurons. Poly-A binding protein-1 (PABP-1) is a marker of stress granules (i.e. 
      accumulations of proteins and RNA indicative of translational arrest in cells 
      under stress). We report on the colocalization of PABP-1 to both TDP-43 and 
      fused-in-sarcoma inclusions in 4 patient cohorts: ALS without a mutation, ALS 
      with an intermediate polyglutamine repeat expansion in ATXN2, ALS with a GGGGCC 
      hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72, and ALS with basophilic inclusion 
      body disease. Notably, PABP-1 colocalization to TDP-43 was twice as frequent in 
      ALS with C9orf72 expansions compared to ALS with no mutation. This study 
      highlights PABP-1 as a protein that is important to the pathology of ALS and 
      indicates that the proteomic profile of TDP-43 inclusions in ALS may differ 
      depending on the causative genetic mutation.

      neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to establish the frequency of ATXN2 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in large cohorts of patients with amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and progressive 
      supranuclear palsy (PSP), and to evaluate whether ATXN2 could act as a modifier 
      gene in patients carrying the C9orf72 expansion. METHODS: We screened a large 
      cohort of French patients (1,144 ALS, 203 FTD, 168 FTD-ALS, and 109 PSP) for 
      ATXN2 CAG repeat length. We included in our cohort 322 carriers of the C9orf72 
      expansion (202 ALS, 63 FTD, and 57 FTD-ALS). RESULTS: We found a significant 
      association with intermediate repeat size (>/=29 CAG) in patients with ALS (both 
      familial and sporadic) and, for the first time, in patients with familial 
      FTD-ALS. Of interest, we found the co-occurrence of pathogenic C9orf72 expansion 
      in 23.2% of ATXN2 intermediate-repeat carriers, all in the FTD-ALS and familial 
      ALS subgroups. In the cohort of C9orf72 carriers, 3.1% of patients also carried 
      an intermediate ATXN2 repeat length. ATXN2 repeat lengths in patients with PSP 
      and FTD were found to be similar to the controls. CONCLUSIONS: ATXN2 intermediary 
      repeat length is a strong risk factor for ALS and FTD-ALS. Furthermore, we 
      propose that ATXN2 polyQ expansions could act as a strong modifier of the FTD 
      phenotype in the presence of a C9orf72 repeat expansion, leading to the 
      development of clinical signs featuring both FTD and ALS.

TI  - Modulation of the age at onset in spinocerebellar ataxia by CAG tracts in various 
      genes.
PG  - 2444-55
LID - 10.1093/brain/awu174 [doi]
AB  - Polyglutamine-coding (CAG)n repeat expansions in seven different genes cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxias. Although the size of the expansion is negatively 
      correlated with age at onset, it accounts for only 50-70% of its variability. To 
      find other factors involved in this variability, we performed a regression 
      analysis in 1255 affected individuals with identified expansions (spinocerebellar 
      ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7), recruited through the European Consortium on 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxias, to determine whether age at onset is influenced by the 
      size of the normal allele in eight causal (CAG)n-containing genes (ATXN1-3, 6-7, 
      17, ATN1 and HTT). We confirmed the negative effect of the expanded allele and 
      detected threshold effects reflected by a quadratic association between age at 
      onset and CAG size in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 3 and 6. We also evidenced 
      an interaction between the expanded and normal alleles in trans in individuals 
      with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 6 and 7. Except for individuals with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, age at onset was also influenced by other 
      (CAG)n-containing genes: ATXN7 in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2; ATXN2, ATN1 and 
      HTT in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3; ATXN1 and ATXN3 in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 6; and ATXN3 and TBP in spinocerebellar ataxia type 7. This suggests that 
      there are biological relationships among these genes. The results were partially 
      replicated in four independent populations representing 460 Caucasians and 216 
      Asian samples; the differences are possibly explained by ethnic or geographical 
      differences. As the variability in age at onset is not completely explained by 
      the effects of the causative and modifier sister genes, other genetic or 
      environmental factors must also play a role in these diseases.

AB  - Identification of genetic mutations has been of burgeoning importance in 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in recent years. The aim of this study was to 
      determine the frequency and spectrum of mutations in major ALS-causing genes in a 
      Taiwanese ALS cohort of Han Chinese origin. Mutational analyses of the SOD1, 
      TARDBP, FUS, OPTN, VCP, UBQLN2, SQSTM1, PFN1, HNRNPA1, and HNRNPA2B1 genes were 
      carried out by direct sequencing in 161 unrelated patients with ALS, including 30 
      with familial ALS (FALS) and 131 with sporadic ALS (SALS). The CAG repeat size in 
      ATXN2 and the GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9ORF72 of the patients were also 
      investigated. Mutations were identified in 33 patients (20.5%, 33/161), including 
      22 with FALS and 11 with SALS. Mutations were identified most frequently in SOD1 
      (7.5%). Three mutations are novel, including SOD1 p.G10A, SOD1 p.D83N, and OPTN 
      p.L494W. These findings broaden the spectrum of ALS-causing mutations and are 
      indispensable for designing optimal strategies of mutational analysis and genetic 
      counseling of ALS for patients of Chinese origin.

AB  - Repeat expansions in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) are an 
      important cause of both motor neuron disease (MND) and frontotemporal dementia 
      (FTD). Currently, little is known about factors that could account for the 
      phenotypic heterogeneity detected in C9ORF72 expansion carriers. In this study, 
      we investigated 4 genes that could represent genetic modifiers: ataxin-2 (ATXN2), 
      non-imprinted in Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome 1 (NIPA1), survival motor neuron 
      1 (SMN1), and survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2). Assessment of these genes, in a 
      unique cohort of 331 C9ORF72 expansion carriers and 376 control subjects, 
      revealed that intermediate repeat lengths in ATXN2 possibly act as disease 
      modifier in C9ORF72 expansion carriers; no evidence was provided for a potential 
      role of NIPA1, SMN1, or SMN2. The effects of intermediate ATXN2 repeats were most 
      profound in probands with MND or FTD/MND (2.1% vs. 0% in control subjects, p = 
      0.013), whereas the frequency in probands with FTD was identical to control 
      subjects. Though intermediate ATXN2 repeats were already known to be associated 
      with MND risk, previous reports did not focus on individuals with clear 
      pathogenic mutations, such as repeat expansions in C9ORF72. Based on our present 
      findings, we postulate that intermediate ATXN2 repeat lengths may render C9ORF72 
      expansion carriers more susceptible to the development of MND; further studies 
      are needed, however, to validate our findings.

TI  - Prediction of the age at onset in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, 2, 3 and 6.
PG  - 479-86

AB  - BACKGROUND: The most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA)--SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and 
      SCA6--are caused by (CAG)n repeat expansion. While the number of repeats of the 
      coding (CAG)n expansions is correlated with the age at onset, there are no 
      appropriate models that include both affected and preclinical carriers allowing 
      for the prediction of age at onset. METHODS: We combined data from two major 
      European cohorts of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6 mutation carriers: 1187 affected 
      individuals from the EUROSCA registry and 123 preclinical individuals from the 
      RISCA cohort. For each SCA genotype, a regression model was fitted using a 
      log-normal distribution for age at onset with the repeat length of the alleles as 
      covariates. From these models, we calculated expected age at onset from birth and 
      conditionally that this age is greater than the current age. RESULTS: For SCA2 
      and SCA3 genotypes, the expanded allele was a significant predictor of age at 
      onset (-0.105+/-0.005 and -0.056+/-0.003) while for SCA1 and SCA6 genotypes both the 
      size of the expanded and normal alleles were significant (expanded: -0.049+/-0.002 
      and -0.090+/-0.009, respectively; normal: +0.013+/-0.005 and -0.029+/-0.010, 
      respectively). According to the model, we indicated the median values (90% 
      critical region) and the expectancy (SD) of the predicted age at onset for each 
      SCA genotype according to the CAG repeat size and current age. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      estimations can be valuable in clinical and research. However, results need to be 
      confirmed in other independent cohorts and in future longitudinal studies.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative and incurable 
      hereditary disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation on ATXN2 gene. The 
      identification of reliable biochemical markers of disease severity is of 
      paramount significance for the development and assessment of clinical trials. In 
      order to evaluate the potential use of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity 
      as a biomarker for SCA2, a case-control study in 38 affected, presymptomatic 
      individuals or healthy controls was conducted. An enlarged sample of 121 affected 
      individuals was set to assess the impact of GST activity on SCA2 clinical 
      expression. There was a significant increase in GST activity in affected 
      individuals relative to controls, although sensibility and specificity were not 
      high. GST activity was not significantly influenced by sex, age, disease duration 
      or CAG repeat size and did not significantly influence disease severity markers. 
      These findings show a disruption of in vivo GST activity in SCA2, suggesting a 
      role for oxidative stress in the neurodegenerative process.

TI  - FTLD-ALS of TDP-43 type and SCA2 in a family with a full ataxin-2 polyglutamine 
      expansion.

AB  - Polyglutamine expansions in the ataxin-2 gene (ATXN2) cause autosomal dominant 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), but have recently also been associated with 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We present clinical and pathological 
      features of a family in which a pathological ATXN2 expansion led to 
      frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ALS (FTLD-ALS) in the index case, but 
      typical SCA2 in a son, and compare the neuropathology with a case of typical 
      SCA2. The index case shares the molecular signature of SCA2 with prominent 
      polyglutamine and p62-positive intranuclear neuronal inclusions mainly in the 
      pontine nuclei, while harbouring more pronounced neocortical and spinal TDP-43 
      pathology. We conclude that ATXN2 mutations can cause not only ALS, but also a 
      neuropathological overlap syndrome of SCA2 and FTLD presenting clinically as pure 
      FTLD-ALS without ataxia. The cause of the phenotypic heterogeneity remains 
      unexplained, but the presence of a CAA-interrupted CAG repeat in the FTLD case in 
      this family suggests that one potential mechanism may be variation in repeat 
      tract composition between members of the same family.

AB  - We evaluated the contributions of various polyglutamine (polyQ) disease genes to 
      Parkinson's disease (PD). We compared the distributions of polyQ repeat lengths 
      in 8 common genes (ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, ATN1, and HTT) in 
      299 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant PD (ADPD) and 329 normal controls. 
      We also analyzed the possibility of genetic interactions between ATXN1 and ATXN2, 
      ATXN2 and ATXN3, and ATXN2 and CACNA1A. Intermediate-length polyQ expansions (>24 
      Qs) of ATXN2 were found in 7 ADPD patients and no controls (7/299 = 2.34% and 
      0/329 = 0%, respectively; p = 0.0053 < 0.05/8 after Bonferroni correction). These 
      patients showed typical L-DOPA-responsive PD phenotypes. Conversely, no 
      significant differences in polyQ repeat lengths were found between the ADPD 
      patients and the controls for the other 7 genes. Our results may support the 
      hypothesis that ATXN2 polyQ expansion is a specific predisposing factor for 
      multiple neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions in ataxin 2 are a risk factor for 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The polyglutamine tract is encoded by a 
      trinucleotide repeat in a coding region of the ataxin 2 gene (ATXN2). Noncoding 
      nucleotide repeat expansions in several genes are also associated with 
      neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. For example, hexanucleotide repeat 
      expansions located in a noncoding region of C9ORF72 are the most common cause of 
      ALS. We sought to assess a potential larger role of noncoding nucleotide repeat 
      expansions in ALS. We analyzed the nucleotide repeat lengths of 6 genes (ATXN8, 
      ATXN10, PPP2R2B, NOP56, DMPK, and JPH3) that have previously been associated with 
      neurologic or neuromuscular disorders, in several hundred sporadic patients with 
      ALS and healthy control subjects. We report no association between ALS and repeat 
      length in any of these genes, suggesting that variation in the noncoding 
      repetitive regions in these genes does not contribute to ALS.

AB  - Limited data exist on the spectrum of heredoataxias in Greece, including the 
      prevalence and phenotype of Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) and the prevalence and 
      subtypes of dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). We analyzed clinically and 
      investigated genetically for FRDA and triplet-repeat expansion SCAs a consecutive 
      series of 186 patients with suspected heredoataxia referred to Athens over 18 
      years. For prevalence estimates we included patients with molecular diagnosis 
      from Cyprus that were absent from the Athens cohort. The minimum prevalence of 
      FRDA was ~0.9/100,000, with clusters of high prevalence in Aegean islands. FRDA 
      was diagnosed in 73 probands. The genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of FRDA was 
      similar to other populations, with one patient compound heterozygote for a known 
      point mutation in FXN (Asn146Lys). Undiagnosed recessive ataxias included 
      FRDA-like and spastic ataxias. The minimum prevalence of dominant SCAs was 
      ~0.7/100,000. SCA1 (4), SCA7 (4), SCA2, SCA6, and SCA17 (1 each) probands were 
      identified. A molecular diagnosis was reached in 31% of dominant cases. 
      Undiagnosed dominant patients included a majority of type III autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxias. FRDA is the commonest heredoataxia in the Greek population 
      with prevalence towards the lower end of other European populations. Dominant 
      SCAs are almost as prevalent. SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and SCA17 patients complete 
      the spectrum of cases with a specific molecular diagnosis.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: A family with coexistence of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 and 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is described. OBSERVATIONS: Intermediate or 
      full CAG repeat expansions of ATXN2 are associated with ALS. However, no 
      coexistence of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 and ALS in a family has been 
      reported in the literature.We describe a 47-year-old woman with an 11-year 
      history of ataxia and her paternal uncle with ALS who were evaluated at Columbia 
      University Medical Center since July 2006. Both our patient with ataxia and her 
      uncle with ALS have full pathological CAG repeat expansions of ATXN2. CONCLUSIONS 
      AND RELEVANCE: The diverse clinical phenotypes of ATXN2 CAG expansions and their 
      coexistence in a single family are highlighted. A clinician should consider the 
      diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 when encountering a patient with 
      ataxia and a family history of ALS.

TI  - Association between spinocerebellar ataxias caused by glutamine expansion and 
      psychiatric and neuropsychological signals - a literature review.
PG  - 57-69
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, also known as spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCA), are characterized by cerebellar degeneration and by their afferent and 
      efferent connections. Currently, at least 31 types of SCA are described, among 
      which a subset, comprising types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 17 of the disease, is 
      distinguished due to sharing the same form of mutation involving the repetition 
      of the series of CAG triplets, known as polyglutamine diseases (SCApolyQ). 
      Through a systematic literature review using the Pubmed, PsycoINFO, LILACS and 
      SciELO databases and the keywords Spinocerebellar Ataxia in association with the 
      words neuropsychiatric, psychological, cognitive impairment(s) and psychiatric 
      comorbidities this study aimed to identify the possible associations between 
      SCApolyQ and neuropsychological and psychiatric symptoms/disorders. A greater 
      presence of symptoms of depression and anxiety was evidenced, as well as the 
      existence of cognitive impairments in the patients with SCApolyQ when compared 
      with the general population, with important differences in the profile of these 
      impairments among the types of SCA. It was observed that the findings, in 
      general, indicated greater impairment in the executive functions, verbal fluency 
      and verbal memory and that there was a higher concentration of studies for SCA2 
      and SCA3. However, there is a need for a greater number of studies using a more 
      homogeneous methodology, which perform direct comparisons between the types of 
      ataxias and that explore some of the still little evaluated neuropsychological 
      functions and the different psychiatric disorders in their amplitude.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder with 
      unclear etiology. Recently, intermediate CAG repeat expansions in ATXN2, the gene 
      responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), have been identified as a 
      possible genetic risk factor for ALS. In this study, we analyzed the ATXN2 CAG 
      repeat length in Chinese patients with ALS to evaluate the relationship between 
      the genotype and phenotype. We studied 1,067 patients with ALS and 506 controls 
      from mainland China (excluding Tibet). We collected clinical data and analyzed 
      fluorescent PCR products to assess ATXN2 CAG repeat length in all of the samples. 
      We observed that intermediate CAG repeat expansions in ATXN2 (CAG repeat length 
      >30) were associated with ALS (p = 0.004). There was no significant difference in 
      clinical characteristics between the groups with and without intermediate CAG 
      repeat expansions in ATXN2. Our data indicate that, for ALS patients from 
      mainland China, intermediate CAG repeat expansions in ATXN2 increase the risk of 
      ALS but have no effect on disease phenotype.

TI  - Autosomal dominant hereditary ataxia in Sri Lanka.
PG  - 39
LID - 10.1186/1471-2377-13-39 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a group of hereditary 
      neurodegenerative disorders. Prevalence of SCA subtypes differ worldwide. 
      Autosomal dominant ataxias are the commonest types of inherited ataxias seen in 
      Sri Lanka. The aim of the study is to determine the genetic etiology of patients 
      with autosomal dominant ataxia in Sri Lanka and to describe the clinical features 
      of each genetic subtype. METHODS: Thirty four patients with autosomal dominant 
      ataxia were recruited. For every patient the following was done: recording of 
      clinical details and genotyping for SCA 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, and 17. RESULTS: 
      Sixty one per cent of the subjects were identified as SCA1. One subject had SCA2, 
      12 remain unidentified. Mean age at onset was 34.8 +/- 10years for SCA1 and 
      32.7 +/- 9.8 for non SCA1. 76% of SCA1 patients and 50% of non SCA1 were using 
      walking aids. Quantification of symptoms and signs were similar in the SCA1 and 
      non SCA1 groups. Clinical depression was evidenced in 68.4% of SCA1 and 75% non 
      SCA-1 patients. Mean CAG repeat length in SCA1 patients was 52.0 +/- 3.8, with 
      greater anticipation seen with paternal inheritance. CONCLUSION: SCA1 was the 
      predominant subtype and showed similar phenotype to previous reports. However, 
      disease severity was higher and depression more prevalent in this population than 
      previously described.

TI  - Analysis of CAG repeats in five SCA loci in Mexican population: epidemiological 
      evidence of a SCA7 founder effect.
PG  - 159-65
LID - 10.1111/cge.12114 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. CAG (cytosine-adenine-guanine) trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 
      causative genes have been identified as the cause of different SCA. In this 
      study, we simultaneously genotyped SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 applying a 
      fluorescent multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay. We analyzed 10 families 
      with SCA (64 patients) from five different communities of Veracruz, a Mexican 
      southeastern state, and identified 55 patients for SCA7 and 9 for SCA2, but none 
      for SCA1, SCA3, or SCA6. To our knowledge, this sample represents one of the 
      largest series of SCA7 cases reported worldwide. Genotyping of 300 healthy 
      individuals from Mexican population and compiled data from different ethnicities 
      showed discordant results concerning the hypothesis that SCA disease alleles 
      arise by expansion of large normal alleles.

      sclerosis.
PG  - 2315-20
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0b013e318278b618 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence suggests that intermediate-length polyglutamine 
      (PolyQ) expansions in the ataxin-2 (ATXN-2) gene are a risk factor for 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This work was undertaken with the aim to 
      investigate the frequency of ataxin-1 (ATXN-1) and ATXN-2 PolyQ expansions in a 
      cohort of patients with sporadic ALS (sALS) and patients with familial ALS (fALS) 
      from southern Italy. METHODS: We assessed the PolyQ lengths of ATXN-1 and ATXN-2 
      in 405 patients with sALS, 13 patients with fALS, and 296 unrelated controls 
      without history of neurodegenerative disorders. RESULTS: We found significantly 
      higher intermediate PolyQ expansions >/= 32 for ATXN-1 alleles and >/= 28 for ATXN-2 
      alleles in the sALS cohort (ATXN-1: ALS, 7.07% vs controls, 2.38%; p = 0.0001; 
      ATXN-2: ALS, 2.72% vs controls, 0.5%; p = 0.001). ATXN-1 CAT and ATXN-2 CAA 
      interruptions were detected in patients with ALS only. Age at onset, site of 
      onset, and sex were not significantly related to the ATXN-1 or ATXN-2 PolyQ 
      repeat length expansions. CONCLUSIONS: Both ATXN-1 and ATXN-2 PolyQ intermediate 
      expansions are independently associated with an increased risk for ALS.

LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2012.231 [doi]
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a genetically and clinically heterogeneous 
      group of diseases, characterized by dominant inheritance, progressive cerebellar 
      ataxia and diverse extracerebellar symptoms. A subgroup of the ataxias is caused 
      by unstable CAG-repeat expansions in their respective genes leading to pathogenic 
      expansions of polyglutamine stretches in the encoded proteins. In general, 
      unstable CAG repeats have an uninterrupted CAG repeat, whereas stable CAG repeats 
      are either short or interrupted by CAA codons, which - like CAG codons - code for 
      glutamine. Here we report on an infantile SCA2 patient who, due to germ-line CAG 
      repeat instability in her father, inherited an extremely expanded CAG repeat in 
      the SCA2 locus. Surprisingly, the expanded allele of the father was an 
      interrupted CAG repeat sequence. Furthermore, analyses of single spermatozoa 
      showed a high frequency of paternal germ-line repeat sequence instability of the 
      expanded SCA2 locus.

AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) encompass a heterogeneous group of 
      rare diseases that affect the cerebellum and its connections. The most common 
      forms have been associated with dynamic mutations while some rarer forms with 
      conventional mutations. Studies in different populations revealed differences in 
      their relative frequencies both within and between the studied populations, 
      showing that the frequencies are depended on ethnic and geographical factors. 
      Previous investigation of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in the Cypriot population, revealed no 
      pathogenic expansion in the Cypriot SCA patients. We hereby present our recent 
      investigation of the SCA10 pentanucleotide repeat expansion. Forty-two 
      ascertained Cypriot sporadic ataxia patients, the index case from 1 ADCA and 14 
      ARCA families and a cohort of normal population individuals were included in the 
      study. All our patients have normal range ATXN10 gene ATTCT repeat numbers 
      (10-19). In the normal population group, repeat lengths ranged from 11 to 20 with 
      the 14 repeats allele being the most frequent. Therefore, all currently 
      established dynamic repeat SCA mutations are absent from the Cypriot population, 
      indicating distinct genetic causes.

TI  - ATXN2 with intermediate-length CAG/CAA repeats does not seem to be a risk factor 
      in hereditary spastic paraplegia.
PG  - 100-2
LID - 10.1016/j.jns.2012.07.036 [doi]
AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) confines a group of heterogeneous 
      neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and lower 
      limb weakness. Age of onset is highly variable even in familial cases with known 
      mutations suggesting that the disease is modulated by other yet unknown 
      parameters. Although progressive gait disturbances, lower limb spasticity and 
      extensor plantar responses are hallmarks of HSP these characteristics are also 
      found in other neurodegenerative disorders, e.g. amytrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (ALS). HSP has been linked to ALS and frontotemporal degeneration with motor 
      neuron disease (FTD-MND), since TDP-43 positive inclusions have recently been 
      found in an HSP subtype, and TDP-43 are found in abundance in pathological 
      inclusions of both ALS and FTD-MND. Furthermore, ataxin-2 (encoded by the gene 
      ATXN2), a polyglutamine containing protein elongated in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 2, has been shown to be a modulator of TDP-43 induced toxicity in ALS animal 
      and cell models. Finally, it has been shown that ATXN2 with non-pathogenic 
      intermediate-length CAG/CAA repeat elongations (encoding the polyglutamine tract) 
      is a genetic risk factor of ALS. Considering the similarities in the disease 
      phenotype and the neuropathological link between ALS and HSP we hypothesized that 
      intermediate-length CAG/CAA repeats in ATXN2 could be a modulator of HSP. We show 
      that in a cohort of 181 HSP patients 4.9 % of the patients had 
      intermediate-length CAG/CAA repeats in ATXN2 which was not significantly 
      different from the frequencies in a Danish control cohort or in American and 
      European control populations. However, the mean age of onset was significantly 
      lower in HSP patients with intermediate-length CAG/CAA repeats in ATXN2 compared 
      to patients with normal length repeats. Based on these results we conclude that 
      ATXN2 is most likely not a risk factor of HSP, whereas it might serve as a 
      modulator of age of onset.

TI  - Inherited polyglutamine spinocerebellar ataxias in South Africa.
PG  - 683-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and distribution of polyglutamine 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) from referrals over a 24-year period to the 
      National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) in South Africa (SA). METHODS: 
      Paper-based clinical reports in the University of Cape Town laboratory and the 
      NHLS electronic patient record database spanning a 24-year period were mined for 
      information regarding the molecular diagnosis, ethnicity and CAG repeat length 
      for individuals referred for molecular genetic testing for the polyglutamine 
      SCAs. RESULTS: SCA1 and 7 are the most frequent types of polyglutamine SCA in the 
      SA patient population, followed by SCA2, 3 and 6. SCA1 is the most common type in 
      the coloured, white and Indian populations, whereas the majority of indigenous 
      black African patients are affected with SCA7 and 2. Of individuals tested, 22% 
      were found to be positive for one of the polyglutamine SCAs. CONCLUSION: Although 
      trends in the frequency and distribution of the polyglutamine SCAs in SA have not 
      changed significantly since our previous study in 2003, they differ remarkably 
      from those reported elsewhere, and reflect the unique genetic and demographic 
      background of SA. The provision of accurate and complete patient information and 
      family history is crucial to the diagnostic process, to enable comprehensive 
      epidemiological studies and assist in developing therapeutic and patient 
      management strategies.

TI  - Corticobasal and ataxia syndromes widen the spectrum of C9ORF72 hexanucleotide 
      expansion disease.

AB  - Recently, a hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion in the first intron of 
      C9ORF72 was reported as the cause of chromosome 9p21-linked frontotemporal 
      dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD-ALS). We here report the prevalence 
      of the expansion in a hospital-based cohort and associated clinical features 
      indicating a wider clinical spectrum of C9ORF72 disease than previously 
      described. We studied 280 patients previously screened for mutations in genes 
      involved in early onset autosomal dominant inherited dementia disorders. A 
      repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction amplification assay was used to identify 
      pathogenic GGGGCC expansions. As a potential modifier, confirmed cases were 
      further investigated for abnormal CAG expansions in ATXN2. A pathogenic GGGGCC 
      expansion was identified in a total of 14 probands. Three of these presented with 
      atypical clinical features and were previously diagnosed with clinical 
      olivopontocerebellar degeneration (OPCD), atypical Parkinsonian syndrome (APS) 
      and a corticobasal syndrome (CBS). Further, the pathogenic expansion was 
      identified in six FTD patients, four patients with FTD-ALS and one ALS patient. 
      All confirmed cases had normal ATXN2 repeat sizes. Our study widens the clinical 
      spectrum of C9ORF72 related disease and confirms the hexanucleotide expansion as 
      a prevalent cause of FTD-ALS disorders. There was no indication of a modifying 
      effect of the ATXN2 gene.

TI  - Analysis of spinocerebellar ataxias due to expanded triplet repeats in Greek 
      patients with cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 178-80
LID - 10.1016/j.jns.2012.03.019 [doi]
AB  - The relative frequency of different autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, 
      commonly referred to as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), varies considerably among 
      populations of different ethnic origin. No data exist at present on the frequency 
      of different SCAs in the Greek population. In the present study we investigated 
      the presence of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in a cohort of 83 Greek patients with slowly 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia. Twenty patients came from autosomal dominant (AD) 
      pedigrees, seven displayed recessive or unclear inheritance and 56 were sporadic. 
      We found four patients with pathological SCA expansions, all from AD pedigrees. 
      Two patients had SCA1, one SCA2 and one SCA7 (10.0, 5.0 and 5.0% of the AD group, 
      respectively). The clinical features of these patients were within the expected 
      spectrum. In total, a pathological expansion was detected in 20% of patients from 
      AD pedigrees. Interestingly, no cases of SCA3 or SCA6 were detected in the AD 
      group. No expansions were found in other familial cases or in sporadic patients. 
      Overall, no cases of SCA3, SCA6, SCA12, SCA17 or DRPLA were identified in the 
      Greek population. In conclusion, SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 are present in Greek 
      patients with AD cerebellar ataxia in frequencies similar to those observed in 
      other populations. SCA3 and SCA6 appear however to be rare in Greece. The genetic 
      cause for the majority of AD ataxias remains to be identified.

AB  - Recently, repeat expansions in several genes have been shown to cause or be 
      associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It has been demonstrated 
      that an intronic hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is a major cause of 
      both familial (approximately 40%) and sporadic (approximately 5%) ALS, as well as 
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In addition, a CAG-repeat expansion in exon 1 of 
      ATXN2, otherwise known to cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, has been 
      identified as a major risk factor for sporadic ALS. Intermediate repeat 
      expansions in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene (55-200 repeats) are 
      known to cause fragile X-associated premature ovarian insufficiency [(FX)POI; 
      female carriers] or fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS; male 
      carriers) by CGG-mediated RNA toxicity. The present investigation involves 
      screening FMR1 repeat length in 742 sporadic ALS patients and 792 matched 
      controls. Our conclusion is that FMR1 repeat expansions are not associated with 
      ALS.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease mainly 
      involving cortical and spinal motor neurons. Several studies indicated that 
      intermediate CAG expansions in ataxin-2 gene (ATXN2) are associated with 
      increased risk of ALS. We analyzed ATXN2 CAG repeats in 658 sporadic ALS patients 
      (SALS), 143 familial ALS cases (FALS), 231 sporadic ataxic subjects, and 551 
      control subjects. The frequency of ATXN2 alleles with 27-30 repeats was similar 
      in SALS and control subjects. Fifteen SALS subjects carried >/= 31 CAG repeats. 
      This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0014). No alleles with >/= 34 
      CAG were found. In FALS, the distribution of ATXN2 alleles was similar to control 
      subjects. Our results further contributed in refining CAG-repeat range 
      significantly associated with sporadic ALS. Literature data and our findings 
      indicate that only alleles with >/= 31 CAG may represent low-penetrance 
      disease/susceptibility alleles associated with variable neurodegenerative 
      phenotypes, including cerebellar ataxia, parkinsonism, and ALS. Overlapping 
      phenotypes should be considered in genetic testing and counseling, both for 
      patients and at-risk family members.

TI  - Genetic screening of Greek patients with Huntington's disease phenocopies 
      identifies an SCA8 expansion.
PG  - 1874-8
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a 
      triad of chorea, psychiatric disturbance and cognitive decline. Around 1% of 
      patients with HD-like symptoms lack the causative HD expansion and are considered 
      HD phenocopies. Genetic diseases that can present as HD phenocopies include 
      HD-like syndromes such as HDL1, HDL2 and HDL4 (SCA17), some spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCAs) and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). In this study we 
      screened a cohort of 21 Greek patients with HD phenocopy syndromes formutations 
      causing HDL2, SCA17, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3,SCA8, SCA12 and DRPLA. Fifteen patients 
      (71%) had a positive family history. We identified one patient (4.8% of the total 
      cohort) with an expansion of 81 combined CTA/CTG repeats at the SCA8 locus. This 
      falls within what is believed to be the high-penetrance allele range. In addition 
      to the classic HD triad, the patient had features of dystonia and oculomotor 
      apraxia. There were no cases of HDL2, SCA17, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA12 or DRPLA. 
      Given the controversy surrounding the SCA8 expansion, the present finding may be 
      incidental. However, if pathogenic, it broadens the phenotype that may be 
      associated with SCA8 expansions. The absence of any other mutations in our cohort 
      is not surprising, given the low probability of reaching a genetic diagnosis in 
      HD phenocopy patients.

TI  - Detection of large expansions in SCA8 using a fluorescent repeat-primed PCR 
      assay.
PG  - 63-6
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia. It is caused by 
      bidirectional expression of (CUG)n expansion in the ATXN80S/ATXN8 gene and (CAG)n 
      expansion transcripts in ATXN8. The diagnosis of SCA8 must be confirmed by the 
      presence of a (CTG)n trinucleotide repeat expansion in the ATXN8OS gene. On the 
      other hand, there are many human genetic diseases that are caused by expansion of 
      short tandem repeats. Since Werner et al proposed a repeat-primed fluorescent PCR 
      to detect large CTG-repeats in myotonic dystrophy, Friedreich ataxia, SCA2, SCA7, 
      SCA10 and SCA12 have been reported. In this study, we applied a fluorescent PCR 
      method for detection of expanded repeats in the ATXN8OS/ATXN8 gene. Although this 
      test cannot give a precise estimate of the size of the expansion, it proved 
      useful for confirming the presence of expansions in SCA8.

AB  - There exists considerable clinical and pathological overlap between 
      frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 
      which implies that these 2 neurodegenerative conditions share common pathogenic 
      mechanisms. Recently, intermediate-length (27-33) polyglutamine (polyQ) 
      expansions in ataxin-2 (ATXN2) have been associated with increased risk for ALS, 
      while expansions of > 34 repeats are known to cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      (Sca-2). We identified in 72 ALS patients one patient with a 33 polyQ expansion 
      that was absent in 810 control individuals. This allele was also found in one 
      patient with concomitant ALS-Sca-2. In contrast, in a Flanders-Belgian series of 
      270 FTLD and 22 FTLD-ALS patients, we found no association with 
      intermediate-length polyQ expansions nor did we observe patient-specific long 
      expansions in agreement with the recent observation in a screening of a 
      substantial sized cohort of patients with diverse neurodegenerative brain 
      diseases. Our results provide further support to the notion that ATXN2 associated 
      polyglutamine amplification is specific to the ALS-end of the FTLD-ALS disease 
      spectrum.

PG  - 356-61
LID - 10.1016/j.nbd.2011.08.021 [doi]
AB  - Full expansions of the polyglutamine domain (polyQ>/=34) within the 
      polysome-associated protein ataxin-2 (ATXN2) are the cause of a multi-system 
      neurodegenerative disorder, which usually presents as a Spino-Cerebellar Ataxia 
      and is therefore known as SCA2, but may rarely manifest as Levodopa-responsive 
      Parkinson syndrome or as motor neuron disease. Intermediate expansions 
      (27</=polyQ</=33) were reported to modify the risk of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
      (ALS). We have now tested the reproducibility and the specificity of this 
      observation. In 559 independent ALS patients from Central Europe, the association 
      of ATXN2 expansions (30</=polyQ</=35) with ALS was highly significant. The study of 
      1490 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) showed an enrichment of ATXN2 alleles 
      27/28 in a subgroup with familial cases, but the overall risk of sporadic PD was 
      unchanged. No association was found between polyQ expansions in Ataxin-3 (ATXN3) 
      and ALS risk. These data indicate a specific interaction between ATXN2 expansions 
      and the causes of ALS, possibly through altered RNA-processing as a common 
      pathogenic factor.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide clinical data on a cohort of 6 patients with massive 
      expansion (>200 CAG repeats) of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) and 
      investigate possible pathways of pathogenesis using bioinformatics analysis of 
      ATXN2 networks. METHODS: We present data on 6 patients with massive expansion of 
      SCA2 who presented in infancy with variable combinations of hypotonia, global 
      developmental delay, infantile spasms, and retinitis pigmentosa. ATXN2 is known 
      to interact with a network of synaptic proteins. To investigate pathways of 
      pathogenesis, we performed bioinformatics analysis on ATXN2 combined with known 
      genes associated with infantile spasms, retinitis pigmentosa, and synaptic 
      function. RESULTS: All patients had a progressive encephalopathy with autonomic 
      dysfunction, 4 had retinitis pigmentosa, and 3 had infantile spasms. The 
      bioinformatics analysis led to several interesting findings. First, an 
      interaction between ATXN2 and SYNJ1 may account for the development of retinitis 
      pigmentosa. Second, dysfunction of postsynaptic vesicle endocytosis may be 
      important in children with this progressive encephalopathy. Infantile spasms may 
      be associated with interactions between ATXN2 and the postsynaptic structural 
      proteins MAGI2 and SPTAN1. CONCLUSIONS: Severe phenotype in children with massive 
      expansion of SCA2 may be due to a functional deficit in protein networks in the 
      postsynapse, specifically involving vesicle endocytosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain quantitative data on the progression of the most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) and identify factors that influence their 
      progression, we initiated the EUROSCA natural history study, a multicentric 
      longitudinal cohort study of 526 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6. We 
      report the results of the 1- and 2-year follow-up visits. METHODS: As the primary 
      outcome measure we used the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA, 
      0-40), and as a secondary measure the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Symptoms (INAS, 
      0-16) count. RESULTS: The annual increase of the SARA score was greatest in SCA1 
      (2.18 +/- 0.17, mean +/- SE) followed by SCA3 (1.61 +/- 0.12) and SCA2 (1.40 +/- 0.11). 
      SARA progression in SCA6 was slowest and nonlinear (first year: 0.35 +/- 0.34, 
      second year: 1.44 +/- 0.34). Analysis of the INAS count yielded similar results. 
      Larger expanded repeats and earlier age at onset were associated with faster SARA 
      progression in SCA1 and SCA2. In SCA1, repeat length of the expanded allele had a 
      similar effect on INAS progression. In SCA3, SARA progression was influenced by 
      the disease duration at inclusion, and INAS progression was faster in females. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study gives a comprehensive quantitative account of disease 
      progression in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6 and identifies factors that 
      specifically affect disease progression.

AB  - Intermediate-length polyglutamine (polyQ) expansions in the ataxin-2 (ATXN2) gene 
      have recently been identified as a risk factor for sporadic amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (SALS). Our study aims to analyze cytosine, adenine, guanine (CAG)n 
      expansions in the ATXN2 gene among Chinese patients with SALS. All patients 
      diagnosed with adult-onset sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were 
      consecutively followed up, and their clinical characteristics were collected. To 
      measure the repeat length of ATXN2 polyQ, fluorescence-polymerase chain reaction 
      products were analyzed on a 3100-Avant Genetic Analyzer Applied Biosystem (Foster 
      City, CA, USA) using the ROC-500 size standard. Three hundred forty-five patients 
      with SALS were studied. The mean age of onset was 51.38 +/- 12.45 years. ATXN2 
      polyQ with a repeat length greater than 27 was found to be weakly associated with 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in our study. There was no significant difference 
      in mean age of onset, gender, and onset site between the group of SALS patients 
      with and without ATXN2 polyQ expansion greater than 27. Our finding provides 
      evidence that the ATXN2 polyQ expansion greater than 27 might be a risk factor 
      for Chinese SALS patients.

AB  - Expanded glutamine repeats of the ataxin-2 (ATXN2) protein cause spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 2 (SCA2), a rare neurodegenerative disorder. More recent studies have 
      suggested that expanded ATXN2 repeats are a genetic risk factor for amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis (ALS) via an RNA-dependent interaction with TDP-43. Given the 
      phenotypic diversity observed in SCA2 patients, we set out to determine the 
      polymorphic nature of the ATXN2 repeat length across a spectrum of 
      neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we genotyped the ATXN2 repeat in 3919 
      neurodegenerative disease patients and 4877 healthy controls and performed 
      logistic regression analysis to determine the association of repeat length with 
      the risk of disease. We confirmed the presence of a significantly higher number 
      of expanded ATXN2 repeat carriers in ALS patients compared with healthy controls 
      (OR = 5.57; P= 0.001; repeat length >30 units). Furthermore, we observed 
      significant association of expanded ATXN2 repeats with the development of 
      progressive supranuclear palsy (OR = 5.83; P= 0.004; repeat length >30 units). 
      Although expanded repeat carriers were also identified in frontotemporal lobar 
      degeneration, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients, these were not 
      significantly more frequent than in controls. Of note, our study identified a 
      number of healthy control individuals who harbor expanded repeat alleles (31-33 
      units), which suggests caution should be taken when attributing specific disease 
      phenotypes to these repeat lengths. In conclusion, our findings confirm the role 
      of ATXN2 as an important risk factor for ALS and support the hypothesis that 
      expanded ATXN2 repeats may predispose to other neurodegenerative diseases, 
      including progressive supranuclear palsy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a group of autosomal dominant 
      ataxias with varied clinical phenotypes. However there are no unique 
      distinguishing features on routine neuroimaging among the various genetically 
      defined SCAs. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) provides an automated unbiased 
      analysis of structural MRI scans and gives a comprehensive assessment of 
      anatomical differences throughout the brain. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study 
      were to (i) characterize the patterns of atrophy in SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3 using 
      optimized VBM, (ii) demonstrate the characteristic anatomical differences in 
      these genetically distinct SCA subtypes, and (iii) assess the relationship 
      between morphometric measures and the CAG repeat lengths and other attributes of 
      the disease. METHODS: Thirty-one genetically confirmed patients suffering from 
      SCA (SCA1 - 12, SCA2 - 9, and SCA3 - 10) were studied. High resolution 
      T1-weighted 3-Dimensional Magnetic Resonance Images of 31 patients were analyzed 
      using the optimized VBM procedure. RESULTS: In all the three SCAs there was a 
      significant loss of gray matter in both cerebellar hemispheres and vermis. 
      Vermian atrophy was more pronounced in SCA3, while SCA1 and SCA2 had significant 
      white matter atrophy. Pontine white matter atrophy was more pronounced in SCA2. 
      In SCA1, the severity of ataxia strongly correlated with the degree of gray 
      matter atrophy in cerebellar hemispheres. The duration of symptoms and lengths of 
      CAG repeats had no correlation with the degree of atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study showed that the different subtypes of SCAs may have morphometric 
      differences in the cerebellum, brainstem and the supratentorial structures.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      of motor neurons that results in progressive muscle weakness and limits survival 
      to 2-5 years after disease onset. Intermediate CAG repeat expansions in ataxin 2 
      (ATXN2), the causative gene of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), have been 
      implicated in sporadic ALS. We studied ATXN2 in a large cohort of patients with 
      sporadic and familial ALS. METHODS: We determined ATXN2 CAG repeat size in 1,948 
      sporadic and familial ALS cases and 2,002 controls from Belgium and the 
      Netherlands. RESULTS: In controls, the maximal ATXN2 repeat size was 31. In 
      sporadic ALS, a significant amount of longer repeat sizes (>/= 32, range 32-39) 
      were encountered (in 0.5% or 10/1,845 ALS cases, vs 0% in controls, p = 0.0006). 
      Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that a cutoff of >/= 29 appeared 
      optimal to discriminate ALS from control (p = 0.036, odds ratio [OR] 1.92, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 1.04-3.64). A meta-analysis with the previously 
      published results from the United States showed that the association between a 
      repeat length of >/= 29 and ALS became stronger (p < 0.0001, OR 2.93, 95% CI 
      1.73-4.98). In unexplained familial ALS, we found an intermediate repeat 
      expansion of 31 and a homozygous repeat expansion of 33 each in 1.1% of families. 
      The phenotype of patients with ALS with expanded repeat sizes ranged from rapidly 
      progressive typical ALS to slowly progressive ALS with reduced sensory nerve 
      action potentials. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal a novel genetic overlap between 
      ALS and SCA2.

TI  - ATXN-2 CAG repeat expansions are interrupted in ALS patients.
PG  - 575-80
LID - 10.1007/s00439-011-1000-2 [doi]
AB  - It has recently been suggested that short expansions of CAG repeat in the gene 
      ATXN-2 causing SCA2 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 2) are associated with an 
      increased risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the populations of the 
      USA and northern Europe. In this study, we investigated the role of ATXN-2 in 
      Italian patients clinically diagnosed with ALS and characterized the molecular 
      structure of ATXN-2 expansions. We assessed the size of the CAG repeat in ATXN-2 
      exon 1 in 232 Italian ALS patients and 395 matched controls. ATXN-2 expanded 
      alleles containing > 30 repeats have been observed in seven sporadic ALS patients 
      (3.0%), while being absent in the controls (p = 0.00089). Four out of the seven 
      patients had an ATXN-2 allele in the intermediate-fully pathological range: one 
      with 32 repeats, 2 with 33 repeats and 1 with 37 repeats, accounting for 1.7% of 
      the ALS cohort. Sequencing of expanded (> 32) alleles showed that they were all 
      interrupted with at least one CAA triplet. ATXN-2 alleles with the same length 
      and structure have been reported in SCA2 patients with parkinsonism or in 
      familial and sporadic Parkinson. Conversely, the phenotype of the present 
      patients was typically ALS with no signs or symptoms of ataxia or parkinsonism. 
      In conclusion, the findings of ATXN-2 expansions in pure ALS cases suggest that 
      ALS may be a third phenotype (alongside ataxia/parkinsonism and pure Parkinson) 
      associated with ATXN-2 interrupted alleles.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating, rapidly progressive disease 
      leading to paralysis and death. Recently, intermediate length polyglutamine 
      (polyQ) repeats of 27-33 in ATAXIN-2 (ATXN2), encoding the ATXN2 protein, were 
      found to increase risk for ALS. In ATXN2, polyQ expansions of >/= 34, which are 
      pure CAG repeat expansions, cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 2. However, similar 
      length expansions that are interrupted with other codons, can present atypically 
      with parkinsonism, suggesting that configuration of the repeat sequence plays an 
      important role in disease manifestation in ATXN2 polyQ expansion diseases. Here 
      we determined whether the expansions in ATXN2 associated with ALS were pure or 
      interrupted CAG repeats, and defined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
      rs695871 and rs695872 in exon 1 of the gene, to assess haplotype association. We 
      found that the expanded repeat alleles of 40 ALS patients and 9 long-repeat 
      length controls were all interrupted, bearing 1-3 CAA codons within the CAG 
      repeat. 21/21 expanded ALS chromosomes with 3CAA interruptions arose from one 
      haplotype (GT), while 18/19 expanded ALS chromosomes with <3CAA interruptions 
      arose from a different haplotype (CC). Moreover, age of disease onset was 
      significantly earlier in patients bearing 3 interruptions vs fewer, and was 
      distinct between haplotypes. These results indicate that CAG repeat expansions in 
      ATXN2 associated with ALS are uniformly interrupted repeats and that the nature 
      of the repeat sequence and haplotype, as well as length of polyQ repeat, may play 
      a role in the neurological effect conferred by expansions in ATXN2.

AB  - DNA triplet repeat expansion-associated ataxias, Friedreich's ataxia, and 
      different types of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are progressive multisystem 
      neurodegenerative disorders. The diagnosis of this wide group of inherited 
      ataxias is essentially based on clinical findings. Cell-free circulating DNA in 
      plasma has been considered as a powerful tool in clinical diagnosis and prognosis 
      of several human diseases. In the present study, clinically suspected patients 
      were assessed on the International Co-operative Ataxia Rating Scale and further 
      confirmed by molecular analysis of DNA triplet repeats. Quantification of plasma 
      DNA using a highly sensitive and DNA-specific PicoGreen fluorescent assay was 
      done. We found significantly high levels (p < 0.001) of plasma DNA of 
      167 +/- 43 ng/mL in Friedreich's ataxia patients (n = 15), 148 +/- 29 ng/mL in SCA2 
      patients (n = 10), and 137 +/- 29 ng/mL in SCA12 patients (n = 25), whereas those 
      of healthy controls (n = 20) was only 59 +/- 15 ng/mL. Therefore, we were able to 
      distinguish between ataxia patients and healthy controls using plasma DNA. 
      Although the precise mechanism by which plasma DNA enters into circulation is not 
      known, significantly higher concentrations of plasma DNA appears to be due to 
      neuronal and muscular degeneration in these patients. Identification of genes in 
      plasma DNA, which are overexpressed or novel, can be a promising tool for the 
      prognosis of these diseases.

LID - 10.1002/mds.23409 [doi]
AB  - Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disorders are commonly associated to patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2); however, these abnormalities have not been 
      studied in presymptomatic gene carriers. To determine whether the REM sleep 
      pathology is detectable before clinical manifestation of SCA2 and evaluate it as 
      a preclinical biomarker, we studied 36 presymptomatic SCA2 individuals and 36 
      controls by video-polysomnography (VPSG) and sleep questionnaires. Presymptomatic 
      subjects showed significant decrease of REM sleep percentage, REMs density, total 
      sleep time, and sleep efficiency. Aging effect on REM sleep percentage was 
      significant in both groups. There was no correlation between 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat length and REM sleep. Our findings 
      identified the REM sleep pathology as a prominent herald sign of SCA2, conferring 
      a special importance to VPSG as a sensitive neurophysiological tool to detect 
      early changes associated with SCA2, which contributes to the understanding of 
      disease pathophysiology and the development of therapeutic trials focused on the 
      preclinical disease stage.

AB  - The causes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating human 
      neurodegenerative disease, are poorly understood, although the protein TDP-43 has 
      been suggested to have a critical role in disease pathogenesis. Here we show that 
      ataxin 2 (ATXN2), a polyglutamine (polyQ) protein mutated in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 2, is a potent modifier of TDP-43 toxicity in animal and cellular 
      models. ATXN2 and TDP-43 associate in a complex that depends on RNA. In spinal 
      cord neurons of ALS patients, ATXN2 is abnormally localized; likewise, TDP-43 
      shows mislocalization in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2. To assess the involvement 
      of ATXN2 in ALS, we analysed the length of the polyQ repeat in the ATXN2 gene in 
      915 ALS patients. We found that intermediate-length polyQ expansions (27-33 
      glutamines) in ATXN2 were significantly associated with ALS. These data establish 
      ATXN2 as a relatively common ALS susceptibility gene. Furthermore, these findings 
      indicate that the TDP-43-ATXN2 interaction may be a promising target for 
      therapeutic intervention in ALS and other TDP-43 proteinopathies.

AB  - Previous studies have investigated the close association that exists between CAG 
      repeat number and the age at onset in SCA2 = spinocerebellar ataxia type 2. These 
      studies have focused on affected individuals. To further characterize this 
      association and estimate the risk of a carrier developing SCA2 at a particular 
      age as a function of a specific CAG repeat size, we have analyzed a large group 
      of 924 individuals, including 394 presymptomatic and 530 affected individuals 
      with a CAG repeat length of 32-79 units. Using a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, 
      we obtained cumulative probability curves for disease manifestation at a 
      particular age for each CAG repeat length in the 34-45 range. These curves were 
      significantly different (p < 0.001) and showed small overlap. All these 
      information may be very valuable in predictive-testing programs, in the planning 
      of studies for the identification of other genetic and environmental factors as 
      modifiers of age at onset, and in the design of clinical trials for people at 
      enlarged risk for SCA2.

AB  - Nerve conduction is profoundly affected in Spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) even 
      before the onset of the disease, but there is no information regarding its 
      progression to the final stage of SCA2. In order to study the progression 
      patterns of nerve conduction abnormalities in SCA2 we performed a prospective 
      follow up evaluation of sensory and motor conduction in 21 SCA2 mutation 
      carriers-initially presymptomatics- and 19 non-SCA2 mutation carriers during 
      20years. The earliest electrophysiological alterations were the reduction of 
      sensory amplitudes in median and sural nerves, which could be found 8 to 5years 
      prior disease onset and in the last 4years of the preclinical stage respectively. 
      These abnormalities were followed by the increase of sensory latencies and 
      decrease of conduction velocities. Sensory amplitudes progressively decreased 
      during the follow-up clinical stage, rendering almost all patients with abnormal 
      amplitudes and lack of sensory potentials, with faster progression rates in 
      patients with larger CAG repeat lengths. Peripheral motor nerves showed the later 
      involvement. These findings were used to define three distinct stages that 
      describe the progression of the peripheral neuropathy. We suggest that sensory 
      amplitudes could be useful biomarkers to assess the progression of peripheral 
      nerve involvement and therefore to evaluate future clinical trials of therapeutic 
      agents.

AB  - The diagnosis and incidence of spinocerebelar ataxias (SCA) is sometimes 
      difficult to analyze due the overlap of phenotypes subtypes and are disorders of 
      mutations caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion. To investigate the 
      incidence of the SCA in Southern Brazil, we analyzed the trinucleotide repeats 
      (CAG)n at the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7 loci to identify allele size ranges 
      and frequencies. We examined blood sample from 154 asymptomatic blood donors and 
      115 individuals with progressive ataxias. PCR products were submitted to 
      capillary electrophoresis. In the blood donors, the ranges of the five loci were: 
      SCA1, 19 to 36 (CAG)n; SCA2, 6 to 28 (CAG)n; SCA3, 12 to 34 (CAG)n; SCA6, 2 to 13 
      (CAG)n; and SCA7, 2 to 10 (CAG)n. No deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
      were detected. In the ataxia group, we found (CAG)n above the range of the 
      asymptomatic blood donors in SCA3 (21.74%) followed by SCA2 (5.22%), SCA7 
      (2.61%), SCA6 (0.87%), and no cases of SCA1. The remaining 80 cases (69.56%) have 
      different diagnoses from the type here studied. These data defined the alleles 
      and their frequencies, as well as demonstrated their stability in the population 
      not affected. The molecular diagnosis test confirmed the clinical diagnosis in 
      28/45 cases and classified another 7/70 from the clinical unclassified ataxias 
      group.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) and type 3 (SCA3) 
      are autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorders. HD is caused by polyglutamine 
      (polyQ) expansion (exp) in the amino-terminal region of a protein huntingtin 
      (Htt) and primarily affects medium spiny striatal neurons (MSN). SCA2 is caused 
      by a polyQ expansion in the amino-terminal region of a cytosolic protein ataxin-2 
      (Atxn2) and primarily affects cerebellar Purkinje neurons. SCA3 is caused by a 
      polyQ expansion in the carboxy-terminal portion of a cytosolic protein ataxin-3 
      (Atxn3) and primarily affects dentate and pontine nuclei and substantia nigra. 
      The reasons for neuronal dysfunction and death in HD, SCA2 and SCA3 remain poorly 
      understood and no cure is available for the patients. My laboratory discovered 
      that mutant Huntingtin, ataxin-2 and ataxin-3 proteins specifically binds to the 
      carboxy-terminal region of the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor 
      (IP(3)R1), an intracellular Ca(2+) release channel. Moreover, we found that 
      association with IP(3)R1 causes sensitization of IP(3)R1 to activation by IP(3) 
      in planar lipid bilayers and in neuronal cells. These results suggested that 
      deranged neuronal Ca(2+) signaling might play an important role in pathogenesis 
      of HD, SCA2 and SCA3. In support of this idea, we demonstrated a connection 
      between abnormal Ca(2+) signaling and neuronal cell death in experimnts with HD, 
      SCA2 and SCA3 transgenic mouse models. Based on these results I propose that 
      IP(3)R and other Ca(2+) signaling proteins should be considered as potential 
      therapeutic targets for treatment of HD, SCA2 and SCA3.

TI  - Common origin of pure and interrupted repeat expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 2 (SCA2).

AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disease characterized by gait and limb ataxia. This disease is 
      caused by the expansion of a (CAG)(n) located in the ATXN2, that encodes a 
      polyglutamine tract of more than 34 repeats. Lately, alleles with 32-33 CAGs have 
      been associated to late-onset disease cases. Repeat interruptions by CAA triplets 
      are common in normal alleles, while expanded alleles usually contain a pure 
      repeat tract. To investigate the mutational origin and the instability associated 
      to the ATXN2 repeat, we performed an extensive haplotype study and sequencing of 
      the CAG/CAA repeat, in a cohort of families of different geographic origins and 
      phenotypes. Our results showed (1) CAA interruptions also in expanded ATXN2 
      alleles; (2) that pathological CAA interrupted alleles shared an ancestral 
      haplotype with pure expanded alleles; and (3) higher genetic diversity in 
      European SCA2 families, suggesting an older European ancestry of SCA2. In 
      conclusion, we found instability towards expansion in interrupted ATXN2 alleles 
      and a shared ancestral ATXN2 haplotype for pure and interrupted expanded alleles; 
      this finding has strong implications in mutation diagnosis and counseling. Our 
      results indicate that interrupted alleles, below the pathological threshold, may 
      be a reservoir of mutable alleles, prone to expansion in subsequent generations, 
      leading to full disease mutation.

AB  - To investigate the prevalence and clinical feature(s) of Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      patients with expanded (ATXN2 and MJD1) genes of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      and 3 (SCA2 and SCA3/MJD) in a mainland Chinese population, CAG triplet repeat 
      expansions of (SCA2 and SCA3/MJD) genes (ATXN2 and MJD1) were analyzed in a 
      cohort of 452 PD patients, including 386 sporadic and 66 familial forms. Striatal 
      dopamine transporter was evaluated in two SCA2 and two SCA3/MJD-positive family 
      members, an idiopathic PD patient and a healthy control using carbon (C11) 
      [(11)C]-radiolabeled-CFT positron emission tomography (PET). We found two 
      patients in one familial PD (FPD) family (1.5%) and two sporadic PD patients 
      (0.5%) with expanded CAG repeats in the ATXN2 locus, four patients in two FPD 
      families (3%) and another three sporadic PD patients (0.8%) in the MJD1 locus. 
      [(11)C]-CFT PET in detected members in SCA2 and SCA3/MJD families showed 
      decrements of (11)C-CFT uptake. These findings suggest that a mutation in SCA2 or 
      SCA3/MJD may be one of the genetic causes of PD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The association between cerebellar ataxia and hypogonadism is seen 
      rarely and is not well recognized. Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is an autosomal 
      dominantly inherited, progressive ataxia disorder, and SCA type 2 (SCA2) 
      characteristically presents with a highly variable phenotype with multisystemic 
      involvement. Although the clinical spectrum of SCA2 is broad, hypogonadism has 
      not been reported as an accompanying symptom. AIM: To report a case study that 
      describes hypergonadotropic hypogonadism as a non-neurological manifestation of 
      cerebellar ataxia in a patient with a hereditary trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      disorder, SCA2. METHODS: Case report of a man admitted to an academic medical 
      center. RESULTS: A 45-year-old man with a history of azoospermia in work-up for 
      infertility was admitted for evaluation of a left-side hand tremor, instability 
      on walking and impaired balance. Upon physical examination, the patient had a 
      micropenis about 3 cm in length and had decreased testicular size (12 cc each) on 
      orchidometry, but normal secondary sexual characteristics and average stature. 
      Laboratory tests showed the presence of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. A brain 
      magnetic resonance imaging scan showed marked atrophy involving both the 
      cerebellum and pons. Genetic analysis for hereditary ataxia demonstrated the 
      presence of a 37 CAG triplet expansion in the mutated allele (genotype 22/37) in 
      the SCA2 gene, confirming the diagnosis of SCA2. CONCLUSION: The present study 
      suggests that a common genetic implication may be shared between these neurologic 
      and non-neurologic signs, and there may be various associations between these 
      heterogeneous manifestations. The clinical spectrum of the SCA2 should be 
      widened, and further data collection is needed to elucidate the relationship 
      among the clinical manifestations.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of spinocerebellar ataxias in Cuba: insights into SCA2 
      founder effect in Holguin.
PG  - 157-60
LID - 10.1016/j.neulet.2009.03.015 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of hereditary ataxias 
      in Cuba, with a special focus on the clinical and molecular features of SCA2. 
      Clinical assessments were performed by neurological examinations and application 
      of the SARA scale. Molecular analyses of genes SCA1-3, SCA6, SCA17 and DRPLA 
      identified 753 patients with SCA and 7173 asymptomatic relatives, belonging to 
      200 unrelated families. 86.79% of all SCA patients were affected with SCA2. In 
      the Holguin province, the average population prevalence of SCA2 is 40.18x10(5) 
      inhabitants, with the remarkable figure of 141.66x10(5) in the Baguanos 
      municipality. The high prevalence of the SCA2 mutation in Holguin reflects most 
      likely a founder effect. The stabilization of the prevalence along time suggests 
      the existence of premutated chromosomes with pure CAG, acting as reservoir for 
      further expansions. CAG repeat length correlated inversely with age at onset, 
      accounting for 80% of the variability. Genetic anticipation was observed in the 
      80% of transmissions. Repeat instability was greater in paternal transmissions 
      whereas CAG expansions without anticipation was observed in 10.97% suggesting the 
      effect of CAA interruptions in the CAG segment, which decrease the toxicity of 
      the abnormal ataxin-2, and/or other protective factors.

      disease at presentation correlates with size of CAG repeat lengths.
PG  - 83-6
LID - 10.1016/j.jns.2008.10.016 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the correlation, if any, 
      between the clinical rate of disease progression at presentation with the CAG 
      repeat size in patients with spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 2 and 3 (SCA1, SCA2 and 
      SCA3). METHODS: The severity of ataxia was measured using the International 
      Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (IARS) in 31 patients of SCA1 (mean+/-SD age: 
      35.1+/-12.6 years; age at onset (AAO): 29.9+/-10.7 years), 25 patients of SCA2 
      (age: 34.9+/-14.9 years; AAO: 29.7+/-14.0 years) and 15 patients of SCA3 (age: 
      40.9+/-8.6 years; AAO: 36.9+/-10.1). The rate of disease progression at 
      presentation was measured by the age adjusted IARS (IARS/Age). For each SCA, 
      correlations of AAO, raw scores of IARS, age adjusted IARS and duration adjusted 
      IARS (IARS/Duration) with the CAG repeat size were determined. RESULTS: The 
      number of CAG repeats of the abnormal allele ranged from 42 to 67 in SCA1, 38 to 
      66 in SCA2, and 69 to 79 in SCA3. In all the three types of SCAs, there were 
      significant inverse correlations of AAO with CAG repeat size (SCA1: r=-0.9, 
      p<0.0001; SCA2: r=-0.7, p<0.0001; SCA3:-0.8, p=0.0003) and significant positive 
      correlations of IARS/Age with CAG repeat size (SCA1: r=0.6, p=0.0015; SCA2: 
      r=0.9, p<0.0001; SCA3:0.7, p=0.0057). However, the raw IARS scores and the 
      duration adjusted IARS scores did not correlate significantly with the CAG repeat 
      sizes. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the rate of clinical disease 
      progression at presentation, especially in SCA2, is dependent on the CAG repeat 
      size, and may commence linearly from birth.

TI  - Intrafamilial variability of Parkinson phenotype in SCAs: novel cases due to SCA2

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) has been related to mutations associated 
      with spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA); the frequency of the diagnosis of these 
      mutations is low in general late-onset PD cases. Our aim was to investigate a 
      selected high-risk group of PD patients. METHODS: PD patients with autosomal 
      dominant inheritance or atypical neurological manifestations were enrolled, 
      underwent a full neurological examination and had the CAG tracts of their SCA1, 
      2, 3, 6 and 7 genes analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 23 studied families, two SCA3 and 
      one SCA2 cases were identified. All had autosomal dominant inheritance. In the 
      SCA2 pedigree, four affected sibs had a homogeneous PD phenotype. CAG repeats 
      varied between 35 and 44 with CAA interruptions. Intrafamilial phenotypic 
      heterogeneity was identified in the SCA3 pedigrees; parkinsonian and ataxic 
      phenotypes coexisted in both kindreds. CAGn varied between 69 and 71 repeats. Age 
      of onset was lower in the SCA3 patients than in the remaining 24 cases (38 versus 
      46.7+/-12 years of age, p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: SCA2 and SCA3 mutations were 
      detected in 13% of the present sample: the strategy of selecting a high-risk 
      group increased the rate of making these diagnoses. The SCA2 cases confirmed an 
      association between PD and interrupted expansions, as well as PD intrafamilial 
      phenotypic homogeneity. Clinical heterogeneity of SCA3 pedigrees suggests that 
      disease-modifying agents outside the MJD1 gene may play a role in determining PD 
      symptoms in this disorder.

AB  - Onset of genetically determined neurodegenerative diseases is difficult to 
      specify because of their insidious and slowly progressive nature. This is 
      especially true for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) because of varying affection of 
      many parts of the nervous system and huge variability of symptoms. We 
      investigated early symptoms in 287 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 and 
      calculated the influence of CAG repeat length on age of onset depending on (1) 
      the definition of disease onset, (2) people defining onset, and (3) duration of 
      symptoms. Gait difficulty was the initial symptom in two-thirds of patients. 
      Double vision, dysarthria, impaired hand writing, and episodic vertigo preceded 
      ataxia in 4% of patients, respectively. Frequency of other early symptoms did not 
      differ from controls and was regarded unspecific. Data about disease onset varied 
      between patients and relatives for 1 year or more in 44% of cases. Influence of 
      repeat length on age of onset was maximum when onset was defined as beginning of 
      permanent gait disturbance and cases with symptoms for more than 10 years were 
      excluded. Under these conditions, CAG repeat length determined 64% of onset 
      variability in SCA1, 67% in SCA2, 46% in SCA3, and 41% in SCA6 demonstrating 
      substantial influence of nonrepeat factors on disease onset in all SCA subtypes. 
      Identification of these factors is of interest as potential targets for disease 
      modifying compounds. In this respect, recognition of early symptoms that develop 
      before onset of ataxia is mandatory to determine the shift from presymptomatic to 
      affected status in SCA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that determine disease severity and clinical 
      phenotype of the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), we studied 526 
      patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3. or SCA6. METHODS: To measure the severity of 
      ataxia we used the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). In 
      addition, nonataxia symptoms were assessed with the Inventory of Non-Ataxia 
      Symptoms (INAS). The INAS count denotes the number of nonataxia symptoms in each 
      patient. RESULTS: An analysis of covariance with SARA score as dependent variable 
      and repeat lengths of the expanded and normal allele, age at onset, and disease 
      duration as independent variables led to multivariate models that explained 60.4% 
      of the SARA score variance in SCA1, 45.4% in SCA2, 46.8% in SCA3, and 33.7% in 
      SCA6. In SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3, SARA was mainly determined by repeat length of the 
      expanded allele, age at onset, and disease duration. The only factors determining 
      the SARA score in SCA6 were age at onset and disease duration. The INAS count was 
      5.0 +/- 2.3 in SCA1, 4.6 +/- 2.2 in SCA2, 5.2 +/- 2.5 in SCA3, and 2.0 +/- 1.7 in 
      SCA6. In SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3, SARA score and disease duration were the strongest 
      predictors of the INAS count. In SCA6, only age at onset and disease duration had 
      an effect on the INAS count. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) 1, SCA2, and SCA3 share a number of common biologic properties, 
      whereas SCA6 is distinct in that its phenotype is more determined by age than by 
      disease-related factors.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) comprise a clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorders 
      affecting the cerebellum and to variable degrees further parts of the nervous 
      system. Electrophysiology is a potent tool to prove impairment of multiple 
      neuronal systems and fibre tracts and even to decipher subclinical affection. 
      Electrooculography, evoked potentials, nerve conduction studies and 
      polysomnography are especially helpful in the setting of SCAs. Severely slowed 
      saccades are a hallmark of SCA2. Vertical nystagmus occurs most frequently in 
      SCA3 and SCA6. Visual potentials recede especially in SCA7. Substantially 
      prolonged central motor conduction times in motor-evoked potentials occur 
      frequently in SCA1 even in patients without clinical signs of pyramidal 
      affection. Thus, electrophysiological analyses may help to predict the SCA 
      genotype and direct molecular genetic diagnostics. Polysomnography is a helpful 
      tool in the analysis of sleep disorders and frequently helps to decipher 
      treatable causes like periodic leg movement in sleep and REM sleep behaviour 
      disorder in SCAs. Nerve conduction studies reveal sensory neuropathy in all 
      common SCA subtypes, but to variable degrees. Age rather than CAG repeat length 
      appears to be the most important determinant for neuropathy and makes sensory 
      nerve action potentials a potential progression marker in SCA.

      polyphagia and marked CAG expansion in infancy.
PG  - 413-9

AB  - We describe an Egyptian family having SCA2 affecting three generations with 
      marked molecular and clinical anticipation observed in the index case. Our 
      proband was a male child starting as early as 2 years old with progressive 
      extrapyramidal manifestations, slow eye movements and cognitive impairment. A 
      history of nonspecific mild developmental delay was recorded. The patient lost 
      all cognitive functions, had persistent dystonic posture, trophic changes, 
      vasomotor instability, dysphagia and died at the age of 7 years. The age at 
      presentation among other affected family members varied between 11 and 45 years 
      old across three generations. The early common neurological symptoms were 
      choreoathetotic movements, myoclonic jerk, gait difficulty, expressionless face 
      and emotional liability. Later, overt ataxia, incoordination, dysarthria, mild 
      dementia and slow eye saccades predominated. Brisk tendon reflexes were detected 
      in three cases. Peripheral nerve affection was a late manifestation. 
      Interestingly, polyphagia and obesity were striking manifestations in the middle 
      stage of the disease; an observation that might support a previously suggested 
      relation between the ataxin-2 gene and body weight. The proband showed an 
      amplified allele with marked CAG expansion in the form of a smear sized 69-75 
      repeats resulted from maternal transmission. To our knowledge, our index case is 
      the second report in the literature presenting with infantile onset SCA2 and 
      intermediate repeat expansion. This family expands the phenotypic spectrum of 
      early onset SCA2 and points out the importance of considering SCA2 gene analysis 
      in children with progressive neurological impairment and abnormal movements with 
      or without polyphagia.

TI  - Molecular analysis of CAG repeats at five different spinocerebellar ataxia loci: 
      correlation and alternative explanations for disease pathogenesis.
PG  - 338-42
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are caused by expansion of (CAG)n triplet repeats. 
      These repeats occur as polymorphic forms in general population; however, beyond a 
      threshold size they become pathogenic. The sizes and distributions of repeats at 
      the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA7 and DRPLA loci were assessed by molecular analysis of 
      124 unrelated ataxia patients and 44 controls, and the association of larger 
      normal (LN) alleles with disease prevalence was evaluated. Triplet repeat 
      expansions in the disease range were detected in 8% (10/124) of the cases, with 
      the majority having expansion at the SCA1 locus. Normal allele ranges in the 
      cohort studied were similar to the Caucasian and North Indian populations but 
      differed from the Korean and Japanese populations at various loci. The percentage 
      of individuals with LN alleles at the SCA1 and SCA2 loci was higher than reported 
      in Indians, Japanese and Caucasians. LN alleles showed a good correlation with 
      the incidence of SCA1, indicating that SCA1 is the most prevalent ataxia in our 
      population. The majority of cases with clinical symptoms of SCA could not be 
      diagnosed by established CAG repeat criteria, suggesting that there may be an 
      alternative basis for disease pathogenesis: (i) Repeats lower than the normal 
      range may also result in abnormal phenotypes (ii) LN alleles at different loci in 
      the same individual may contribute to symptoms (iii) Exogenous factors may play a 
      role in triggering disease symptoms in individuals with LN alleles (iv) Triplet 
      repeats may reach the disease range in the brain but not in the blood.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias type 1, 2 and 3: a study of heart rate variability.
PG  - 337-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect cardiac autonomic dysfunction, using analysis of heart rate 
      variability in genetically defined spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA). MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Consecutive RR intervals were analyzed for time- and frequency-domain 
      parameters in 22 genotypically proven SCA patients (SCA1 = 11, SCA2 = 6 and SCA3 
      = 5) and compared with that of age- and gender-matched controls. RESULTS: 
      Reduction in the standard deviation of RR interval (RR_SD) was seen in 72.7% of 
      SCA patients. There was a reduction in both the parasympathetic and sympathetic 
      parameters in SCA without any change in the ratio of low- to high-frequency 
      power. In SCA1, there was a significant negative correlation between RR_SD and 
      duration of illness but not with the CAG repeat lengths of the abnormal allele. 
      Small sample size of SCA2 and SCA3 precluded similar comparison. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Cardiac autonomic dysfunction, predominantly parasympathetic, was seen in SCA, 
      and the severity correlated with the duration of illness in SCA1.

TI  - Case control analysis of repeat expansion size in ataxia.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurological diseases. The expansion of unstable microsatellite 
      repeats has been identified as the underlying pathogenic cause of 10 subtypes of 
      autosomal dominant SCAs. The aetiology of sporadic SCA is unknown. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effect of large normal repeats in patients 
      presenting with sporadic or familial ataxia compared to a control population. The 
      size of the expansion was determined using a fluorescent PCR approach in 10 
      common SCA genes: SCA-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 (CACNA1A), 
      SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), SCA-17 (TBP) 
      and DRPLA (ATN1), in 165 ataxia patients and 307 controls of Welsh origin. There 
      was no difference between cases and controls in the distribution of the large 
      normal alleles, or in the distribution of the combined CAG repeats. The normal 
      allele distribution in the Welsh population was largely similar to that of other 
      Caucasian populations. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of large normal 
      repeats on the susceptibility to develop ataxia.

TI  - Importance of low-range CAG expansion and CAA interruption in SCA2 Parkinsonism.
PG  - 1510-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the presence of an ATXN2 mutation in patients with 
      parkinsonism in the Korean population and to find the difference in the ATXN2 
      mutation between ataxic and parkinsonian phenotypes. DESIGN: Survey. SETTING: 
      Seoul National University Hospital (a referral center). Patients Patients with 
      Parkinson disease (PD) (n = 468) and the Parkinson variant of multiple system 
      atrophy (MSA-P) (n = 135) who were seen at our Department of Neurology during the 
      past 3 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CAG expansion in spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      2 (SCA2) alleles was assessed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and 
      fragment analysis, and its size and interruption were verified by cloning and 
      sequencing. SCA2 was tested also in the family members of the probands. Striatal 
      dopamine transporter (DAT) and D(2) receptor status were evaluated in the 
      probands and their SCA2-positive family members using iodine I 123 
      [(123)I]-radiolabeled fluoropropyl (FP) 2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-iodophenyl) tropane 
      (CIT) with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and carbon C 11 
      [(11)C]-radiolabeled raclopride positron emission tomography (PET). RESULTS: We 
      found 3 patients with apparently sporadic disease with expanded CAG repeats in 
      the ATXN2 locus. Two patients had a PD phenotype. The third patient showed an 
      MSA-P phenotype. The CAG repeats in the ATXN2 locus of the patients were 35/22, 
      34/22, and 32/22, respectively (range in normal population, 19-27). The size of 
      repeats was lower than the CAG repeats (38-51) in ataxic SCA2 in our population. 
      The sequence of expanded CAG repeats was interrupted by CAA as 
      (CAG)(n)(CAA)(CAG)(8) in all the patients. DNA analyses in 2 families showed 2 
      asymptomatic carriers in each family. In the patient with the PD phenotype, 
      striatal DAT loss was more severe in the putamen than the caudate, and 
      [(11)C]raclopride PET showed an increased relative putamen-caudate binding ratio. 
      The patient with the MSA-P phenotype had severe DAT loss throughout the striatum. 
      Two of 3 asymptomatic carriers had striatal DAT loss. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      demonstrates that SCA2 is one of the genetic causes of PD and MSA-P. All 3 
      patients had apparently sporadic disease, emphasizing the need to screen even in 
      patients with nonfamilial disease. CAG repeats were in the low expansion range 
      and interrupted by CAA in all patients in the low-range expansion. Therefore, 
      accurate determination of CAG expansion and ATXN2 sequencing are warranted. 
      [(123)I]FP-CIT SPECT and [(11)C]raclopride PET provide a useful way to evaluate 
      the degree of nigrostriatal dopaminergic damage in SCA2-related parkinsonism and 
      gene carriers.

      atypical Parkinsonism.
PG  - 1971-4
AB  - Anecdotal reports suggest that patients with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA 2) 
      patients can present with postural tremor with ataxia. We determined the 
      prevalence of SCA2 and SCA3 mutations in a cohort of ET and atypical Parkinsonism 
      patients. A total of 277 subjects comprising of 177 ET and 100 atypical 
      Parkinsonism were examined. We identified one positive case of SCA3 among those 
      who were diagnosed with ET, yielding a prevalence of 0.5%, but a zero prevalence 
      among our atypical Parkinsonism patients. No study subjects carried an abnormal 
      SCA2 repeat expansion. Our study highlights that SCA3 can present initially with 
      ET symptoms, expanding the spectrum of genetic diseases that can be associated 
      with ET-like phenotype. Routine screening for SCA2 and SCA3 in ET and atypical 
      Parkinsonism patients may not be cost effective. However, in the long-term 
      follow-up of patients who present with an ET phenotype, clinicians should be 
      vigilant for other neurological signs, which may be point to an alternate 
      diagnosis.

TI  - Mitochondrial complex I gene variant associated with early age at onset in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2.
PG  - 1042-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: A common mitochondrial complex I gene polymorphism (10398G) is 
      reported to be inversely associated with the risk of Parkinson disease. We 
      hypothesized that this variant might have a protective effect on the central 
      nervous system and therefore might delay the onset of symptoms in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 2 (SCA2). OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of the 10398G 
      polymorphism with age at onset in Cuban patients with SCA2. DESIGN: Genetic 
      association study. SETTING: Holguin, Cuba. PATIENTS: Forty-six Cuban patients 
      with SCA2. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence or absence of the 10398G polymorphism 
      was determined in 46 Cuban patients with SCA2 and early or late onset of 
      symptoms, defined as at least 2 SDs lower than or higher than the mean age at 
      onset for patients with a similarly sized triplet repeat expansion. RESULTS: The 
      polymorphism was present in 11 of 27 Cuban patients with SCA2 and early onset 
      (41%) vs 2 of 19 with late onset (11%) (Fisher exact test; P = .04). CONCLUSION: 
      Contrary to our prediction of a later onset of SCA2 in patients with the 10398G 
      polymorphism, we find that this variant is associated with an earlier age at 
      onset in Cuban patients with SCA2.

TI  - Are interrupted SCA2 CAG repeat expansions responsible for parkinsonism?
PG  - 1970-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant parkinsonism (ADP) is caused in a large percentage 
      of familial and sporadic cases by mutations in the LRRK2 gene, particularly 
      G2019S. It is also caused by mutations in genes associated with autosomal 
      dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA), notably CAG/CAA repeat expansions in SCA2. 
      METHODS: We screened 164 families with ADP for expansions in the SCA2, 3, and 17 
      genes and for the G2019S mutation in LRRK2. The SCA2 CAG/CAA repeat expansion was 
      sequenced to determine its structure. The phenotypes of patients with ADP caused 
      by the SCA2, LRRK2, and unknown mutations were compared, as well as those of SCA2 
      patients with interrupted or uninterrupted expansions of the same size. RESULTS: 
      Three French ADP families had SCA2 mutations. The expansions ranged from 37 to 39 
      repeats and were interrupted and stable upon transmission. All patients (n = 9) 
      had levodopa-responsive parkinsonism without cerebellar signs. They had 
      significantly more symmetric signs and less rigidity than ADP caused by the 
      G2019S mutation in LRRK2 or by unknown mutations. Interestingly, two sisters 
      carrying both the SCA2 and the G2019S LRRK2 mutations had markedly earlier onset 
      than their mother with only SCA2. In contrast, similar-sized but uninterrupted 
      repeats were associated with ADCA in which cerebellar ataxia was constant and 
      associated only rarely with one or more mild parkinsonian signs. CONCLUSION: 
      These results suggest that the configuration of the SCA2 CAG/CAA repeat 
      expansions plays an important role in phenotype variability. Uninterrupted SCA2 
      repeat expansions found in families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia 
      result in somatic mosaicism and produce large hairpin RNAs, which may interact 
      with double-stranded RNA-binding proteins. These characteristics are modified by 
      interruption of the SCA2 repeat expansion as found in families with autosomal 
      dominant parkinsonism.

TI  - Lack of mutations in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 and 3 genes in a Taiwanese 
      (ethnic Chinese) cohort of familial and early-onset parkinsonism.
PG  - 434-8
AB  - Recent reports suggest that CAG triplet expansions of spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      2 and 3 (SCA2 and SCA3) genes are the cause of typical levodopa-responsive 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) in familial cases, several of which were ethnic Chinese. 
      To investigate the role of SCA2 and SCA3 mutations in Chinese familial and 
      early-onset PD patients, we analyzed CAG triplet repeat expansions of SCA2 and 
      SCA3 genes in a cohort of 73 Taiwanese/Ethnic Chinese familial and early-onset PD 
      patients [mean age at onset 42.70 +/- 7.17 years (mean +/- SD)]. Thirteen of them 
      (17.8%) had positive family history. All patients received comprehensive clinical 
      evaluation including a thorough neurological examination, laboratory tests, and 
      neuroimaging studies to exclude secondary causes and atypical parkinsonism. The 
      CAG repeat length in these genes was determined using polymerase chain reaction 
      polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. SCA2 gene CAG repeats ranged from 15 to 26 
      repeats with a median of 20, and SCA3 gene CAG repeats ranged from 15 to 40 with 
      a median of 15. No long pathogenic repeats were found in either SCA2 or SCA3, 
      although borderline CAG repeat number was detected in the SCA3 gene of four 
      patients. Thus, mutations of SCA2 or SCA3 did not play a major role in familial 
      or early-onset PD in our study cohort. PD patients without autosomal dominant 
      family history or obvious cerebellar ataxia should not be candidates for routine 
      screening of SCA2 or SCA3 mutations for cost-effectiveness.

TI  - Multiplex families with multiple system atrophy.
PG  - 545-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) has been considered a sporadic disease, 
      without patterns of inheritance. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of 
      4 multiplex families with MSA, including clinical genetic aspects. DESIGN: 
      Clinical and genetic study. SETTING: Four departments of neurology in Japan. 
      Patients Eight patients in 4 families with parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and 
      autonomic failure with age at onset ranging from 58 to 72 years. Two siblings in 
      each family were affected with these conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical 
      evaluation was performed according to criteria by Gilman et al. Trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the responsible genes for the spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 
      series and for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) was evaluated by 
      polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequence analysis of coding regions in the 
      alpha-synuclein gene was performed. RESULTS: Consanguineous marriage was observed 
      in 1 of 4 families. Among 8 patients, 1 had definite MSA, 5 had probable MSA, and 
      2 had possible MSA. The most frequent phenotype was MSA with predominant 
      parkinsonism, observed in 5 patients. Six patients showed pontine atrophy with 
      cross sign or slitlike signal change at the posterolateral putaminal margin or 
      both on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Possibilities of hereditary ataxias, 
      including SCA1 (ataxin 1, ATXN1), SCA2 (ATXN2), Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3 
      (ATXN1), SCA6 (ATXN1), SCA7 (ATXN7), SCA12 (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory 
      subunit B, beta isoform; PP2R2B), SCA17 (TATA box binding protein, TBP) and DRPLA 
      (atrophin 1; ATN1), were excluded, and no mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene 
      were found. CONCLUSIONS: Findings in these multiplex families suggest the 
      presence of familial MSA with autosomal recessive inheritance and a genetic 
      predisposition to MSA. Molecular genetic approaches focusing on familial MSA are 
      expected to provide clues to the pathogenesis of MSA.

TI  - Genetic analysis of SCA2, 3 and 17 in idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 11-4
AB  - Recent reports of SCA2 and SCA3 patients who presented with levodopa responsive 
      parkinsonism have generated considerable interest as they have implications for 
      genetic testing. It is unclear whether ethnic race alone or founder effects 
      within certain geographical region explain such an association. In this study, we 
      conducted genetic analysis of SCA2, 3, 17 in an ethnic Chinese cohort with early 
      onset and familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy controls. A total of 191 
      subjects comprising of 91 PD and 100 healthy controls were examined. We 
      identified one positive case of SCA2 in an early-onset sporadic PD patient who 
      had CAG 36 repeats, yielding a prevalence of 2.2% in early-onset sporadic PD 
      patients and less than 1.0% in our study PD population. The size of the repeats 
      was lower than the expanded repeats (38-57) in SCA2 patients with ataxia in our 
      population. All the children of the patient were physically normal even though 
      some of them carried the repeat expansion of similar size. No cases and controls 
      were positive for SCA3 and SCA17. We do not think routine screening of SCA2, SCA3 
      and SCA17 for all idiopathic PD patients is cost-effective in our ethnic Chinese 
      population. However, SCA2 should be a differential diagnosis in young onset 
      sporadic PD when genetic mutations of other known PD genes have been excluded.

PG  - 128-32
AB  - Large expansions in the SCA2 and SCA7 genes (>100 CAG repeats) have been 
      associated with juvenile and infantile forms of cerebellar ataxias that cannot be 
      detected using standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Here, we describe a 
      successful application of the fluorescent short tandem repeat-primed PCR method 
      for accurate identification of these expanded repeats. The test is robust, 
      reliable, and inexpensive and can be used to screen large series of patients, 
      although it cannot give a precise evaluation of the size of the expansion. This 
      test may be of practical value in prenatal diagnoses offered to affected or 
      pre-symptomatic at-risk parents, in which a very large expansion inherited from 
      one of the parents can be missed in the fetus by standard PCR.

TI  - CAG repeats in Restless Legs syndrome.
PG  - 173-6
AB  - Recent reports established an association of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1, 2, and 3. To evaluate the contribution of 
      SCA alleles to idiopathic RLS we investigated the CAG repeat length at the SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17 loci in 215 patients who fulfilled the clinical 
      criteria of RLS and presented periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS) in 
      polysomnographic recording. Fifty percent of patients had a positive family 
      history of RLS. We found one intermediate (CAG)(43) allele for SCA17 in a 
      44-year-old female with RLS starting at the age of 43. Neurologic examination and 
      family history were unremarkable in this patient. Otherwise, allele distribution 
      did not differ between RLS patients and healthy controls. Stratification for age, 
      age of onset, sex, peripheral neuropathy, and sporadic or familial RLS revealed 
      no effect. Thus, CAG repeat length in the investigated genes is not a major 
      determinant of idiopathic or familial RLS.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2: polyQ repeat variation in the CACNA1A calcium 
      channel modifies age of onset.
PG  - 2297-303
AB  - Nine neurodegenerative diseases, collectively referred to as polyglutamine 
      (polyQ) diseases, are caused by expansion of a coding CAG DNA trinucleotide 
      repeat. PolyQ diseases show a strong inverse correlation between CAG repeat 
      length and age of disease onset (AO). Despite this, individuals with identical 
      repeat expansion alleles can have highly variable disease onset indicating that 
      other factors also influence AO. We examined AO in 148 individuals in 57 sibships 
      from the SCA2 founder population in Cuba. The mutant CAG repeat allele explained 
      57% of AO variance. To estimate heritability of the residual variance after 
      correction for SCA2 repeat length, we applied variance component analysis and 
      determined the coefficient of intraclass correlation. We found that 55% of the 
      residual AO variance was familial. To test candidate modifier alleles in this 
      population, we selected 64 unrelated individuals from a set of 394 individuals 
      who were highly discordant for AO after correction for SCA2 CAG repeat length. We 
      hypothesized that long normal alleles in the other 8 polyQ disease genes were 
      associated with premature disease onset in SCA2. Of the 8 genes tested, only long 
      normal CAG repeats in the CACNA1A gene were associated with disease onset earlier 
      than expected based on SCA2 CAG repeat size using non-parametric tests for 
      alleles (P < 0.04) and genotypes (P < 0.023) after correction for multiple 
      comparisons. CACNA1A variation explained 5.8% of the residual variation in AO. 
      The CACNA1A calcium channel subunit represents an excellent candidate as a 
      modifier of disease in SCA2. It is highly expressed in Purkinje cells (PCs) and 
      is essential for the generation of the P/Q current and the complex spike in PCs. 
      In contrast to other polyQ proteins, which are nuclear, the CACNA1A and SCA2 
      proteins are both cytoplasmic. Furthermore, small pathologic expansions of the 
      polyQ domain in the CACNA1A protein lead to PC degeneration in SCA6. Future 
      studies are needed to determine whether the modifier effect of CACNA1A relates to 
      neuronal dysfunction or cell death of Purkinje neurons.

TI  - Analysis of SCA-2 and SCA-3 repeats in Parkinsonism: evidence of SCA-2 expansion 
      in a family with autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 191-4
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are progressive neurodegenerative disorders 
      linked to more than 20 genetic loci. Most often, these diseases are caused by 
      expansion of triplet repeats encoding polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts. The phenotype 
      is variable and can cause a disease that overlaps clinically with Parkinson's 
      disease (PD). l-Dopa-responsive parkinsonism with minimal cerebellar deficits has 
      been described in SCA2 and SCA3. In order to define if mutation at these loci is 
      a common cause of clinically defined parkinsonism we typed the SCA-2 and SCA-3 
      repeats for expansion in a series of 280 patients diagnosed with PD or 
      parkinsonism. We identified one pathogenic expansion in SCA-2 in a North American 
      family with autosomal dominant parkinsonism.

TI  - Age at onset variance analysis in spinocerebellar ataxias: a study in a 
      Dutch-French cohort.
PG  - 505-12
AB  - In dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), the issue of whether non-CAG 
      dependent factors contribute to onset age remains unsettled. Data on SCA 
      genotype, onset age, normal/expanded CAG repeat length, sex of the patient and 
      transmitting parent, and family details were available from 802 patients. Based 
      on the model [log(10) (age at onset) = k - b CAG(exp) + epsilon], we examined 
      changes in adjusted R(2) and residual standard error following incorporation of 
      the other factors in this model. The expanded repeat explained 44.3 to 74.9% of 
      onset age variance, although this was less than 50% in SCA3 and SCA6, implicating 
      a large effect of non-CAG factors. The relation between onset age and CAG repeat 
      was similar for SCA1, 3, 6, and 7, but different for SCA2, pointing to different 
      polyglutamine effects in SCA2. For SCA2 and SCA3, 17.1 and 45.5% of onset age 
      variance, respectively, were explained by currently (unidentified) familial 
      factors. We found a significant contribution of the nonexpanded allele in SCA1 
      and SCA6. Besides polyglutamine motif (determined by the expanded CAG repeat 
      length), we identified the following age at onset modifiers: protein context in 
      SCA2; familial factors in SCA2 and SCA3; and the nonexpanded CAG repeat in SCA1 
      and SCA6.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat analysis of spinocerebellar ataxia patients in Oman.
PG  - 61-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the profile of cytosine/adenine/guanine (CAG) repeat 
      expansion in Omani spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) patients. METHODS: Ten SCA 
      patients attending the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital Neurologic clinics, 
      Al-Khoud, Oman in the 3 years starting from January 2000 were recruited for this 
      study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples and CAG repeat 
      expansion analysis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing, 
      when required. RESULTS: The CAG triplet repeats leading to polyglutamine 
      expansion and neurodegeneration are seen in spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 
      and 17. By using primers for SCA 1, 2, 3 and 7, we found the repeats were in the 
      normal range and triplet repeats do not seem to be a common cause for ataxia in 
      Oman. CONCLUSION: Spinocerebellar ataxia in Oman has the normal range of CAG 
      repeats for the commonly found SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA7.

TI  - Comparative genetics of functional trinucleotide tandem repeats in humans and 
      apes.
PG  - 329-39
AB  - Several human neurodegenerative disorders are caused by the expansion of 
      polymorphic trinucleotide repeat regions. Many of these loci are functional short 
      tandem repeats (STRs) located in brain-expressed genes, and their study is thus 
      relevant from both a medical and an evolutionary point of view. The aims of our 
      study are to infer the comparative pattern of variation and evolution of this set 
      of loci in order to show species-specific features in this group of STRs and on 
      their potential for expansion (therefore, an insight into evolutionary medicine) 
      and to unravel whether any human-specific feature may be identified in 
      brain-expressed genes involved in human disease. We analyzed the variability of 
      the normal range of seven expanding STR CAG/CTG loci (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3-MJD, SCA6, 
      SCA8, SCA12, and DRPLA) and two nonexpanding polymorphic CAG loci (KCNN3 and 
      NCOA3) in humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. The study showed a 
      general conservation of the repetitive tract and of the polymorphism in the four 
      species and high heterogeneity among loci distributions. Humans present slightly 
      larger alleles than the rest of species but a more relevant difference appears in 
      variability levels: Humans are the species with the largest variance, although 
      only for the expanding loci, suggesting a relationship between variability levels 
      and expansion potential. The sequence analysis shows high levels of sequence 
      conservation among species, a lack of correspondence between interruption 
      patterns and variability levels, and signs of conservative selective pressure for 
      some of the STR loci. Only two loci (SCA1 and SCA8) show a human specific 
      distribution, with larger alleles than the rest of species. This could account, 
      at the same time, for a human-specific trait and a predisposition to disease 
      through expansion.

TI  - CAG repeats containing CAA interruptions form branched hairpin structures in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 transcripts.
PG  - 3898-910
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), one of the hereditary human 
      neurodegenerative disorders, is caused by the expansion of the CAG tandem repeats 
      in the translated sequence of the SCA2 gene. In a normal population the CAG 
      repeat is polymorphic not only in length but also in the number and localization 
      of its CAA interruptions. The aim of this study was to determine the structure of 
      the repeat region in the normal and mutant SCA2 transcripts and to reveal the 
      structural basis of its normal function and dysfunction. We show here that the 
      properties of the CAA interruptions are major determinants of the CAG repeat 
      folding in the normal SCA2 transcripts. We also show that the uninterrupted 
      repeats in mutant transcripts form slippery hairpins, whose length is further 
      reduced by the base pairing of the repeat portion with a specific flanking 
      sequence. The structural organization of the repeat interruption systems present 
      in other human transcripts, such as SCA1, TBP, FOXP2, and MAML2, are also 
      discussed.

TI  - Can ataxin-2 be down-regulated by allele-specific de novo DNA methylation in SCA2 
      patients?
PG  - 1018-23
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion within the coding region of the ataxin-2 gene. Affected individuals 
      typically have between 34 and 57 CAG repeats. Signs of the disorder generally 
      begin in adulthood and include progressive ataxia, dysarthria, tremor, 
      hyporeflexia, and slow saccades. As with other trinucleotide repeat disorders, 
      SCA2 exhibits an inverse correlation between the size of the CAG repeat and the 
      age at onset of clinically detectable disease, with neonatal cases of SCA2 being 
      reported in individuals harboring over 200 CAG repeats. However, a wide range of 
      age at onset is typically observed, especially in individuals with < 40 CAG 
      repeats. CAG repeat number alone explains approximately 25-80% of the 
      variability. In this paper, we hypothesize that the level of mutant ataxin-2 
      protein in affected cells contributes to these differences. One of the mechanisms 
      that might influence this protein levels is de novo DNA methylation, which would 
      specifically target the allele with the expanded CAG repeat leading to 
      transcriptional silencing. Consequently, the symptoms of SCA2 would occur later 
      in the patient's life history. Our postulations, as well as those previously 
      reported to account for the phenotype of SCA2, are discussed.

TI  - Patterns of CAG repeat interruptions in SCA1 and SCA2 genes in relation to repeat 
      instability.
PG  - 236-47
AB  - About 3% of the human genome is composed of simple sequence repeats and many of 
      these sequences occur within genes. These repeats are often polymorphic in a 
      normal population and their expansion in specific genes leads to a number of 
      hereditary neurological diseases. Normal variants of disease-related genes 
      contain either pure or interrupted repeats, and the postulated function of the 
      interruptions is to prevent repeat expansions. Their structural role in the 
      repeat tracts of genes and transcripts awaits detailed characterization. In this 
      study, we have determined the SCA1 and SCA2 genotypes in a Polish population and 
      found significant differences in allele spectra and frequencies from those 
      reported for other populations. They are discussed in relation to the repeat 
      expansion mechanism and disease incidence. We postulate that the dynamic mutation 
      of the genes SCA1 (also ATX1 or ataxin 1) and SCA2 (also ATX2 or ataxin 2) may 
      begin from the expansion of long pure repeat tracts without the prior loss of 
      interruptions. A simple way of cost-effective allelotyping of CAG repeat regions 
      in the SCA1 and SCA2genes is also shown. The reliable SSCP/duplex analysis 
      presented here may be the method of choice for the systematic searching of genes 
      for known and novel interrupted repeats.

TI  - Structural and functional analysis of ataxin-2 and ataxin-3.
PG  - 3155-70
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia types 2 (SCA2) and 3 (SCA3) are autosomal-dominantly 
      inherited, neurodegenerative diseases caused by CAG repeat expansions in the 
      coding regions of the genes encoding ataxin-2 and ataxin-3, respectively. To 
      provide a rationale for further functional experiments, we explored the protein 
      architectures of ataxin-2 and ataxin-3. Using structure-based multiple sequence 
      alignments of homologous proteins, we investigated domains, sequence motifs, and 
      interaction partners. Our analyses focused on presumably functional amino acids 
      and the construction of tertiary structure models of the RNA-binding Lsm domain 
      of ataxin-2 and the deubiquitinating Josephin domain of ataxin-3. We also 
      speculate about distant evolutionary relationships of ubiquitin-binding UIM, GAT, 
      UBA and CUE domains and helical ANTH and UBX domain extensions.

TI  - Molecular genetics of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia: mutation analysis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia genes and CAG/CTG repeat expansion detection in 225 
      Italian families.
PG  - 727-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, at present 
      associated with 22 loci (spinocerebellar ataxia [SCA] 1-SCA8, SCA10-SCA19, SCA21, 
      SCA22, fibroblast growth factor 14 [FGF14]-SCA, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy [DRPLA]). The relevant gene has been identified in 12 cases (SCA1-3, 
      SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, FGF14, and DRPLA), and in all but the recently identified 
      SCA14, SCA17, PRKCG and FGF14 genes, the defect consists of the expansion of a 
      short nucleotide repeat. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relative prevalence of 
      SCA1-3, SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, and SCA17 gene expansions in Italian families with 
      hereditary ataxia, specifically to verify the occurrence of SCA10, SCA12, and 
      SCA17 in Italy; and to analyze samples from probands with negative test results 
      at the initial screening by means of the repeat expansion detection technique to 
      identify CAG/CTG expansions in novel loci.Patients Two hundred twenty-five 
      unrelated Italian index cases with hereditary ataxia, most (n = 183) of whom 
      presented with a clear dominantly transmitted trait. RESULTS: We found that SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene mutations accounted for most cases (21% and 24%, respectively). We 
      found SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, and SCA17 to be very rare (approximately 1% each), 
      and no case of SCA10 or SCA12 was identified. Half of the index cases (113/225) 
      were negative for expansions in the known SCA genes. Repeat expansion detection 
      analysis performed on 111 of these cases showed a CAG/CTG repeat expansion of at 
      least 50 triplets in 22 (20%). Twenty-one of 22 expansions could be attributed to 
      length variation at 2 polymorphic loci (expanded repeat domain CAG/CTG 1 [ERDA1] 
      or CTG repeat on chromosome 18q21.1 [CTG18.1]). In 1 patient, the expansion was 
      assigned to the DRPLA gene. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of SCA1-3 and SCA6-7 
      gene mutations is peculiar in Italy. We found a relatively high frequency of SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene expansions; SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 mutations were rare, compared with 
      other European countries. No SCA10 or SCA12 and only a few SCA8 (2/225) and SCA17 
      (2/225) families were detected. In patients negative for defects in known SCA 
      genes, repeat expansion detection data strongly suggest that, at least in our 
      population, CAG/CTG expansions in novel genes should be considered an unlikely 
      cause of the SCA phenotype.

TI  - Analysis of trinucleotide repeats in different SCA loci in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      patients and in normal population of Taiwan.
PG  - 355-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) patients referred to our research 
      center, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD (Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, SCA8 and SCA12 
      loci were assessed for expansion of trinucleotide repeats. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      A total of 211 ADCA patients, including 202 patients with dominantly inherited 
      ataxia from 81 Taiwanese families and nine patients with sporadic ataxia, were 
      included in this study and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. 
      The amplified products of all loci were analyzed on both 3% agarose gels and 6% 
      denaturing urea-polyacrylamide gels. PCR-based Southern blots were also applied 
      for the detection of SCA7 locus. RESULTS: The SCA1 mutation was detected in six 
      affected individuals from one family (1.2%) with expanded alleles of 50-53 CAG 
      repeats. Fourteen individuals from nine families (11%) had a CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while affected SCA2 alleles have 34-49 CAG 
      repeats. The SCA3/MJD CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in 60 affected 
      individuals from 26 families (32%) was expanded to 71-85 CAG repeats. As for the 
      SCA7 locus, there were two affected individuals from one family (1.2%) possessed 
      41 and 100 CAG repeats, respectively. However, we did not detect expansion in the 
      SCA6, SCA8 and SCA12 loci in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The SCA3/MJD CAG expansion 
      was the most frequent mutation among the SCA patients. The relative prevalence of 
      SCA3/MJD in Taiwan was higher than that of SCA2, SCA1 and SCA7.

TI  - Possible reduced penetrance of expansion of 44 to 47 CAG/CAA repeats in the 
      TATA-binding protein gene in spinocerebellar ataxia type 17.
PG  - 209-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is an autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia caused by expansion of CAG/CAA trinucleotide repeats in the 
      TATA-binding protein (TBP) gene. Because the number of triplets in patients with 
      SCA17 in previous studies ranged from 43 to 63, the normal number of 
      trinucleotide units has been considered to be 42 or less. However, some healthy 
      subjects in SCA17 pedigrees carry alleles with the same number of expanded 
      repeats as patients with SCA17. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the minimum number of 
      CAG/CAA repeats in the TBP gene that causes SCA17. DESIGN: We amplified the 
      region of the TBP gene containing the CAG/CAA repeat by means of polymerase chain 
      reaction and performed fragment and sequence analyses. PATIENTS: The subjects 
      included 734 patients with SCA (480 patients with sporadic SCA and 254 patients 
      with familial SCA) without CAG repeat expansions at the SCA1, SCA2, 
      Machado-Joseph disease, SCA6, SCA7, or dentatorubral-pallidolluysian atrophy 
      loci, with 162 healthy subjects, 216 patients with Parkinson disease, and 195 
      with Alzheimer disease as control subjects. RESULTS: Eight patients with SCA 
      possessed an allele with more than 43 CAG/CAA repeats. Among the non-SCA groups, 
      alleles with 43 to 45 repeats were seen in 3 healthy subjects and 2 with 
      Parkinson disease. In 1 SCA pedigree, a patient with possible SCA17 and her 
      healthy sister had alleles with 45 repeats. A 34-year-old man carrying alleles 
      with 47 and 44 repeats (47/44) had developed progressive cerebellar ataxia and 
      myoclonus at 25 years of age, and he exhibited dementia and pyramidal signs. He 
      was the only affected person in his pedigree, although his father and mother 
      carried alleles with mildly expanded repeats (44/36 and 47/36, respectively). In 
      another pedigree, 1 patient carried a 43-repeat allele, whereas another patient 
      had 2 normal alleles, indicating that the 43-repeat allele may not be pathologic 
      in this family. CONCLUSIONS: We estimate that 44 CAG/CAA repeats is the minimum 
      number required to cause SCA17. However, the existence of unaffected subjects 
      with mildly expanded triplets suggests that the TBP gene mutation may not 
      penetrate fully. Homozygosity of alleles with mildly expanded triplet repeats in 
      the TBP gene might contribute to the pathologic phenotype.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia: SCA2 is the most frequent mutation in 
      eastern India.
PG  - 448-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) has been reported as the 
      commonest dominant hereditary ataxia in India. However, India is an ethnically 
      and religiously diverse population. Previous studies have not clearly indicated 
      exact ethnic and religious origins, and must therefore be interpreted with 
      caution. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of different 
      SCA mutations in a relatively homogeneous population from eastern India. METHODS: 
      We identified 28 families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia from eastern 
      India. Each underwent full clinical evaluation and were analysed for the presence 
      of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, and SCA17 mutations. In addition, 
      haplotype analysis was carried out in seven of the 16 families with SCA2. 
      RESULTS: Seven patients from four (14%) families were positive for an expansion 
      in SCA1 and 26 patients from 16 (57%) families were positive for an expansion in 
      SCA2. No mutations were detected in the remaining eight families (29%). Most of 
      the SCA1 and SCA2 families were Hindu from the state of Bihar. Five out of 26 
      SCA2 patients in this study did not have slow saccades. In addition, four of 
      seven SCA1 patients had slow saccades. We found an association between the SCA2 
      CAG repeat expansion and the 285 base pair (bp) allele of microsatellite marker 
      D12S1672, and also data supportive of the association between the expansion and 
      the 225 bp allele of D12S1333, which has been previously described. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We conclude that (1) although slow ocular saccades are highly suggestive of SCA2, 
      that they are not universal, nor are they exclusive to this disorder and (2) SCA2 
      is likely to be the commonest dominant ataxia in eastern India, with further 
      evidence for a founder effect.

TI  - Genetic testing in spinocerebellar ataxia in Taiwan: expansions of trinucleotide 
      repeats in SCA8 and SCA17 are associated with typical Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 209-14
AB  - DNA tests in normal subjects and patients with ataxia and Parkinson's disease 
      (PD) were carried out to assess the frequency of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) and 
      to document the distribution of SCA mutations underlying ethnic Chinese in 
      Taiwan. MJD/SCA3 (46%) was the most common autosomal dominant SCA in the 
      Taiwanese cohort, followed by SCA6 (18%) and SCA1 (3%). No expansions of SCA 
      types 2, 10, 12, or dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) were detected. The 
      clinical phenotypes of these affected SCA patients were very heterogeneous. All 
      of them showed clinical symptoms of cerebellar ataxia, with or without other 
      associated features. The frequencies of large normal alleles are closely 
      associated with the prevalence of SCA1, SCA2, MJD/SCA3, SCA6, and DRPLA among 
      Taiwanese, Japanese, and Caucasians. Interestingly, abnormal expansions of SCA8 
      and SCA17 genes were detected in patients with PD. The clinical presentation for 
      these patients is typical of idiopathic PD with the following characteristics: 
      late onset of disease, resting tremor in the limbs, rigidity, bradykinesia, and a 
      good response to levodopa. This study appears to be the first report describing 
      the PD phenotype in association with an expanded allele in the TATA-binding 
      protein gene and suggests that SCA8 may also be a cause of typical PD.

TI  - The parkinsonian phenotype of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2.
PG  - 35-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: We recently reported that spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) caused 
      familial parkinsonism in 2 brothers with predominant symptoms of resting tremor, 
      rigidity, and bradykinesia that responded to levodopa. OBJECTIVE: To investigate 
      SCA2 as the possible cause of familial parkinsonism in our series and 
      subsequently to analyze the correlation between the clinical manifestation and 
      CAG repeat size in the ataxin-2 gene product. PATIENTS: One hundred thirty 
      patients from 41 families with familial parkinsonism were examined for SCA2. 
      Another 8 patients with the classic ataxic phenotype of SCA2 from 6 families were 
      the control group. DESIGN: The length of expanded CAG repeat was analyzed by 
      means of polymerase chain reaction. The clinical data and genetic findings in the 
      parkinsonian phenotype were then compared with those in the ataxic phenotype. 
      RESULTS: We found expanded CAG repeats in the ataxin-2 gene product in 7 patients 
      from 4 families with parkin-sonism, which was about 10% of our familial 
      parkinsonism series. The parkinsonian phenotype was characterized by resting 
      tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Only mild dysarthria, ataxic gait, and 
      instability were noted, particularly in the late stage. Patients with the 
      parkinsonian phenotype had an older mean +/- SD age of symptom onset (45.8 +/- 
      13.9 years) and shorter mean +/- SD abnormal CAG length (36.2 +/- 1.1 repeats) 
      than did those with the ataxic phenotype (26.9 +/- 11.0 years and 43.1 +/- 3.2 
      repeats). Parkinsonian SCA2 responded well to levodopa. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude 
      that SCA2 is a minor cause of familial parkinsonism, particularly in Taiwan. The 
      parkinsonian phenotype is associated predominantly with a shorter abnormal range 
      of CAG repeat lengths and older onset age. Because of the clinical resemblance 
      among familial parkinsonisms, we suggest that SCA2 should be excluded in cases of 
      familial parkinsonism.

TI  - Mutation at the SCA17 locus is not a common cause of parkinsonism.
PG  - 317-20
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 17 is a dominant, progressive, neurodegenerative 
      disorder. The disease is caused by a triplet repeat expansion mutation within 
      TATA-binding protein (TBP). Ataxia, dementia, parkinsonism and dystonia are 
      common features. We have previously shown in several pedigrees that SCA-2 and 
      SCA-3 can cause both parkinsonism and typical Parkinson's disease in the absence 
      of prominent ataxia; a finding which has been confirmed by others. Given these 
      previous findings and the description of parkinsonism as a common feature of 
      SCA-17 we examined this locus in a series of probands from families with 2 or 
      more members affected with parkinsonism (n=51) and a group of sporadic 
      parkinsonism patients (n=59). We did not find any repeat sizes in the pathogenic 
      range. The repeats we observed ranged from 29 to 41 (mean 36.8; median 37). We 
      conclude that SCA-17 repeat expansion mutations are not a common cause of 
      familial parkinsonism.

TI  - Expansion of the polyQ repeat in ataxin-2 alters its Golgi localization, disrupts 
      the Golgi complex and causes cell death.
PG  - 1485-96
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is caused by the expansion of a 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat in ataxin-2, the SCA2 gene product. In contrast to 
      other polyQ diseases, intranuclear inclusions are not prominent in SCA2. In 
      animal models with expression of mutant ataxin-2 targeted to Purkinje cells, 
      neuronal dysfunction and morphologic changes are observed without the formation 
      of intranuclear aggregates. In this report, we investigated the mechanisms 
      underlying SCA2 pathogenesis using cellular models. We confirmed that the SCA2 
      gene product, ataxin-2, was predominantly located in the Golgi apparatus. 
      Deletion of ER-exit and trans-Golgi signals in ataxin-2 resulted in an altered 
      subcellular distribution. Expression of full-length ataxin-2 with an expanded 
      repeat disrupted the normal morphology of the Golgi complex and colocalization 
      with Golgi markers was lost. Intranuclear inclusions were only seen when the 
      polyQ repeat was expanded to 104 glutamines, and even then were only observed in 
      a small minority of cells. Expression of ataxin-2 with expanded repeats in PC12 
      and COS1 cells increased cell death compared with normal ataxin-2 and elevated 
      the levels of activated caspase-3 and TUNEL-positive cells. These results suggest 
      a link between cell death mediated by mutant ataxin-2 and the stability of the 
      Golgi complex. The formation of intranuclear aggregates is not necessary for in 
      vitro cell death caused by expression of full-length mutant ataxin-2.

TI  - Frequency analysis and clinical characterization of spinocerebellar ataxia types 
      1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 in Korean patients.
PG  - 858-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: By genetic analysis, the CAG repeat expansion has been established in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. Despite the genetic 
      differentiation of SCA, the characterization of the phenotypes of various SCAs 
      has been challenging for better clinical diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the 
      frequencies and the clinical manifestations of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 
      in Korean patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed genetic analysis in 253 
      unrelated Korean patients with progressive cerebellar ataxia. We compared the 
      frequencies, inheritance patterns, and various clinical manifestations of 
      patients with genetically confirmed SCA. RESULTS: Among the 52 patients with 
      expanded CAG repeat, the most frequent SCA type was SCA2, followed by SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA1, and SCA7. Nine patients (17%) had a negative family history of ataxia, 
      mostly in SCA6. There were characteristic clinical features such as hypotonia and 
      optic atrophy for SCA1; hyporeflexia for SCA2; nystagmus, bulging eye, and 
      dystonia for SCA3; and macular degeneration for SCA7. Interestingly, 4 patients 
      (1 with SCA2, 1 with SCA3, and 2 with SCA6) were misdiagnosed as having 
      multiple-system atrophy because of the absence of family history and the presence 
      of parkinsonism and urinary incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a 
      detailed analysis of the clinical characteristics of the genetically defined 
      CAG-repeat SCAs in Korean patients. Although phenotypes were heterogeneous, some 
      clinical features may be helpful for clinical diagnosis. However, genetic studies 
      for SCA are needed despite uncertain family history or the presence of atypical 
      clinical features causing misdiagnosis as atypical parkinsonism.

TI  - A novel autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA22) linked to chromosome 
      1p21-q23.
PG  - 1293-9
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically, pathologically 
      and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. Ten responsible genes have been 
      identified for spinocerebellar ataxia types SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, 
      SCA10, SCA12 and SCA17, and dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      mutation is caused by an expansion of a CAG, CTG or ATTCT repeat sequence of 
      these genes. Six additional loci, SCA4, SCA5, SCA11, SCA13, SCA14 and SCA16 have 
      also been mapped. The growing heterogeneity of the autosomal dominant forms of 
      these diseases shows that the genetic aetiologies of at least 20% of ADCA have 
      yet to be elucidated. We ascertained and clinically characterized a 
      four-generation Chinese pedigree segregating an autosomal dominant phenotype for 
      cerebellar ataxia. Direct mutation analysis, linkage analysis for all known SCA 
      loci and a genome-wide linkage study were performed. Direct mutation analysis 
      excluded SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17 and DRPLA, and genetic linkage analysis 
      excluded SCA4, 5, 11, 13, 14 and 16. The genome-wide linkage study suggested 
      linkage to a locus on chromosome 1p21-q23, with the highest two-point LOD score 
      at D1S1167 (Zmax = 3.46 at theta = 0.00). Multipoint analysis and haplotype 
      reconstruction traced this novel SCA locus (SCA22) to a 43.7-cM interval flanked 
      by D1S206 and D1S2878 (Zmax = 3.78 under four liability classes, and 2.67 using 
      affected-only method). The age at onset ranged from 10 to 46 years. All affected 
      members had gait ataxia with variable features of dysarthria and hyporeflexia. 
      Head MRI showed homogeneous atrophy of the cerebellum without involvement of the 
      brainstem. In six parent-child pairs, median onset occurred 10 years earlier in 
      offspring than in their parents, suggesting anticipation. This family is distinct 
      from other families with SCA and is characterized by a slowly progressive, pure 
      cerebellar ataxia.

TI  - The gene for HMSN2C maps to 12q23-24: a region of neuromuscular disorders.
PG  - 1151-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type 2C (HMSN2C, 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2C [CMT2C]) is an autosomal dominant motor and sensory 
      neuropathy involving limb, diaphragm, vocal cord, and intercostal muscles. 
      OBJECTIVE: To identify the chromosome localization for this disorder in one large 
      American family of English and Scottish ethnicity. METHODS: Variable clinical 
      severity led the authors to combine several approaches to accurately identify 
      affected patients. Genome-wide two-point linkage analysis, high-definition 
      mapping, and multipoint and recombinant haplotype analyses were performed. 
      Mutation analysis of the triplet repeat region of ataxin-2 was also carried out. 
      RESULTS: The initial genome-wide scan identified a region at 12q24, and fine 
      mapping provided a maximal lod score of 4.73 (D12S1645 and D12S1583 at theta = 
      0.01 and 0, respectively). With multipoint analysis, a higher lod score of 5.17 
      was obtained and localized to the same region at 119.0 cM. Haplotype analysis 
      narrowed the region to approximately 5.0 cM between D12S1646,D12S1330 and 
      D12S105,D12S1339 (12q23.3-24.21). Ataxin-2, the gene responsible for 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), localizes to this region, but no triplet 
      repeat expansion or point mutations within the repeat were found. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The gene for HMSN2C maps to 12q23-24. This region is associated with SCA2, 
      scapuloperoneal spinal muscular atrophy, and congenital distal spinal muscular 
      atrophy. Further studies are needed to demonstrate the specific gene alteration 
      and its relationship with nearby genes.

TI  - SCA2 may present as levodopa-responsive parkinsonism.
PG  - 425-9
AB  - Some kindreds with familial parkinsonism exhibit genetic anticipation, suggesting 
      possible involvement of trinucleotide repeat expansion. Recent reports have shown 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions in the spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) gene in 
      patients with levodopa-responsive parkinsonism. We tested 136 unrelated patients 
      with familial parkinsonism for SCA2 mutations. Two probands had borderline 
      mutations; the rest were normal. (<or=31 repeats is normal, 32-35 is borderline, 
      >or=36 is pathogenic). The expanded allele segregated with neurological signs in 
      one kindred. The absence of borderline mutations in the normal population, and 
      the co-segregation of the expanded allele with neurological signs in one kindred 
      suggest that SCA2 mutations may be responsible for a subset of familial 
      parkinsonism.

TI  - Searching for modulating effects of SCA2, SCA6 and DRPLA CAG tracts on the 
      Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3) phenotype.
PG  - 211-4
AB  - CONTEXT: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD/SCA3) is an autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia of adult onset. The variability in age at onset and the complex and 
      heterogeneous neurologic findings indicate that MJD, caused by a major gene, is 
      modulated by modifier factors. OBJECTIVE: To study if the polymorphic CAG repeats 
      at other loci (namely, SCA2, SCA6 and DRPLA) thus acted as modifier factors of 
      this disease. DESIGN: Case-control. SETTING: Ambulatory care in a referral 
      center. PATIENTS: A convenience sample of 39 unrelated, Brazilian patients with 
      MJD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: age of onset, anticipation, clinical subtypes and 
      neurological findings. RESULTS: Fasciculations were associated with CAG repeat 
      length of the long SCA2 allele (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.03, after Bonferroni 
      procedure). Other measures (age of onset, anticipation, clinical types and other 
      neurological signs) were not associated with CAG repeat length of SCA2, SCA6 and 
      DRPLA genes. CONCLUSIONS: The present results show that the CAG tract of SCA2 
      gene interferes with MJD phenotype. Further studies, with patients of other 
      origins and with typing of other (CAG)n loci, are necessary.

      localized to chromosome 12q23-24. Recent studies have widened the clinical 
      phenotype, notably for individuals with repeats of intermediate size, from 32 to 
      35 glutamine residues. This narrow range necessitates precise determination of 
      repeat size. Diagnostic laboratories most often perform direct genotyping of ATX2 
      from polymerase chain-amplified patient DNA with subsequent sizing utilizing slab 
      gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) or capillary electrophoresis. Using 
      cloning and sequencing methods, we have constructed a ladder of ATX2 alleles of 
      known size and sequence composition. This freely available size ladder will 
      facilitate future quantification of expansions of the ATX2 locus.

TI  - Paradoxical absence of nuclear inclusion in cerebellar Purkinje cells of 
      hereditary ataxias linked to CAG expansion.
PG  - 450-2
AB  - Degeneration of cerebellar cortex is one of the principal features of hereditary 
      ataxias linked to expansion of CAG repeat. In an attempt to clarify possible 
      correlation between neuronal depletion and neuronal intranuclear inclusions, both 
      triggered by the pathological expansion of CAG repeat, cerebellar sections from 
      SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and DRPLA cases were immunostained with anti-ubiquitin or 
      anti-expanded polyglutamine antibody (1C2) and were screened for the presence of 
      neuronal intranuclear inclusions. Although the degree of cerebellar degeneration 
      varied greatly, cerebellar Purkinje cells were uniformly characterised by the 
      absence of neuronal intranuclear inclusion. Complete absence of neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusion in Purkinje cells is apparently paradoxical and hardly 
      explained if neuronal intranuclear inclusion formation is positively correlated 
      to a mechanism accelerating neuronal death. It may, otherwise, suggest an 
      intrinsic link between neuronal intranuclear inclusion formation and 
      neurodegeneration in opposite directions in human Purkinje cells, more or less 
      affected in these CAG repeat disorders.

TI  - Changes of cortical excitability of human motor cortex in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 2. A study with paired transcranial magnetic stimulation.
PG  - 87-92
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate motor cortex excitability in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). Cortical silent period (CSP), motor 
      thresholds, and intracortical inhibition and facilitation by paired transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) were investigated in 18 SCA2 patients and in 20 
      controls. The mean CSP duration and motor threshold after TMS were significantly 
      increased in the patient group. Intracortical inhibition by paired TMS at short 
      interstimulus intervals (ISIs) showed no significant differences between patients 
      and controls; at longer ISIs, the expected facilitation of test responses, 
      observed in control subjects, resulted significantly less marked in SCA2 patients 
      at all the tested intervals. Our findings extend previous findings on cerebellar 
      dysfunctions of varying aetiologies by investigating intracortical excitability 
      in SCA2. In addition, this study demonstrates that the cortical excitability 
      involvement found in SCA2 is independent on the cytosine-adenine-guanine repeat 
      expansion. The neurophysiological alterations seen in our patients relate to the 
      worsening of general clinical condition. Thus, we might speculate that changes of 
      motor cortex excitability in SCA2 represent a slow neurodegenerative process 
      characterized by gradual loss of cerebellar neurons leading to an increasing 
      disturbance of the balance between inhibitory and excitatory circuits in the 
      motor system.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeats in 202 families with ataxia: a small expanded (CAG)n allele 
      at the SCA17 locus.
PG  - 623-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ten neurodegenerative disorders characterized by spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) are known to be caused by trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansions. 
      However, in some instances the molecular diagnosis is considered indeterminate 
      because of the overlap between normal and affected allele ranges. In addition, 
      the mechanism that generates expanded alleles is not completely understood. 
      OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical and molecular characteristics of a large group 
      of Portuguese and Brazilian families with ataxia to improve knowledge of the 
      molecular diagnosis of SCA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have (1) assessed repeat 
      sizes at all known TNR loci implicated in SCA; (2) determined frequency 
      distributions of normal alleles and expansions; and (3) looked at 
      genotype-phenotype correlations in 202 unrelated Portuguese and Brazilian 
      patients with SCA. Molecular analysis of TNR expansions was performed using 
      polymerase chain reaction amplification. RESULTS: Patients from 110 unrelated 
      families with SCA showed TNR expansions at 1 of the loci studied. Dominantly 
      transmitted cases had (CAG)(n) expansions at the Machado-Joseph disease gene 
      (MJD1) (63%), at SCA2 (3%), the gene for dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) (2%), SCA6 (1%), or SCA7 (1%) loci, or (CTG)(n) expansions at the SCA8 
      (2%) gene, whereas (GAA)(n) expansions in the Freidreich ataxia gene (FRDA) were 
      found in 64% of families with recessive ataxia. Isolated patients also had TNR 
      expansions at the MJD1 (6%), SCA8 (6%), or FRDA (8%) genes; in addition, an 
      expanded allele at the TATA-binding protein gene (TBP), with 43 CAGs, was present 
      in a patient with ataxia and mental deterioration. Associations between 
      frequencies of SCA2 and SCA6 and a frequency of large normal alleles were found 
      in Portuguese and Brazilian individuals, respectively. Interestingly, no 
      association between the frequencies of DRPLA and large normal alleles was found 
      in the Portuguese group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that (1) a significant 
      number of isolated cases of ataxia are due to TNR expansions; (2) expanded DRPLA 
      alleles in Portuguese families may have evolved from an ancestral haplotype; and 
      (3) small (CAG)(n) expansions at the TBP gene may cause SCA17.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias in the Netherlands: prevalence and age at onset variance 
      analysis.
PG  - 702-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: International prevalence estimates of autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxias (ADCA) vary from 0.3 to 2.0 per 100,000. The prevalence of ADCA in the 
      Netherlands is unknown. Fifteen genetic loci have been identified (SCA-1-8, 
      SCA-10-14, SCA-16, and SCA-17) and nine of the corresponding genes have been 
      cloned. In SCA-1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA-12 and SCA-17 the mutation has been 
      shown to be an expanded CAG repeat. Previously, the length of the CAG repeat was 
      found to account for 50 to 80% of variance in age at onset. Because of 
      heterogeneity in encoded proteins, different pathophysiologic mechanisms leading 
      to neurodegeneration could be involved. The relationship between CAG repeat 
      length and age at onset would then differ accordingly. METHOD: Based on the 
      results of SCA mutation analysis in the three DNA diagnostic laboratories that 
      serve the entire Dutch population, the authors surveyed the number of families 
      and affected individuals per SCA gene, as well as individual repeat length and 
      age at onset. Regression analysis was applied to study the relationship between 
      CAG repeat length and age at onset per SCA gene. The slopes of the different 
      regression curves were compared. RESULTS: On November 1, 2000, mutations were 
      found in 145 ADCA families and 391 affected individuals were identified. The 
      authors extrapolated a minimal prevalence of 3.0 per 100,000 (range 2.8 to 
      3.8/100,000). SCA3 was the most frequent mutation. CAG repeat length contributed 
      to 52 to 76% of age at onset variance. Regression curve slopes for SCA-1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, and SCA7 did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated minimal 
      prevalence of ADCA in the Netherlands is 3.0 per 100,000 inhabitants. Except for 
      SCA6, the relationship between age at onset and CAG repeat expansion does not 
      differ significantly between SCA-1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA7 patient groups in our 
      population, indicating that these SCA subtypes share similar mechanisms of 
      polyglutamine-induced neurotoxicity, despite heterogeneity in gene products.

TI  - Spastic paraplegia, ataxia, mental retardation (SPAR): a novel genetic disorder.
PG  - 411-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a kindred with a dominantly inherited neurologic disorder 
      manifested either as uncomplicated spastic paraplegia or ataxia, spastic 
      paraplegia, and mental retardation. METHODS: Neurologic examinations and 
      molecular genetic analysis (exclusion of known SCA and HSP genes and loci; and 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion detection [RED]) were performed in six affected 
      and four unaffected subjects in this family. MRI, electromyography (EMG), and 
      nerve conduction studies were performed in three affected subjects. RESULTS: The 
      phenotype of this dominantly inherited syndrome varied in succeeding generations. 
      Pure spastic paraplegia was present in the earliest generation; subsequent 
      generations had ataxia and mental retardation. MRI showed marked atrophy of the 
      spinal cord in all patients and cerebellar atrophy in those with ataxia. 
      Laboratory analysis showed that the disorder was not caused by mutations in genes 
      that cause SCA-1, SCA-2, SCA-3, SCA-6, SCA-7, SCA-8, and SCA-12; not linked to 
      other known loci for autosomal dominant ataxia (SCA-4, SCA-5, SCA-10, SCA-11, 
      SCA-13, SCA-14, and SCA-16); and not linked to known loci for autosomal dominant 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (SPG-3, SPG-4, SPG-6, SPG-8, SPG-9, SPG-10, 
      SPG-12, and SPG-13) or autosomal recessive HSP SPG-7. Analysis of 
      intergenerational differences in age at onset of symptoms suggests genetic 
      anticipation. Using RED, the authors did not detect expanded CAG, CCT, TGG, or 
      CGT repeats that segregate with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The authors describe an 
      unusual, dominantly inherited neurologic disorder in which the phenotype (pure 
      spastic paraplegia or spastic ataxia with variable mental retardation) differed 
      in subsequent generations. The molecular explanation for apparent genetic 
      anticipation does not appear to involve trinucleotide repeat expansion.

TI  - Molecular analysis of Spinocerebellar ataxias in Koreans: frequencies and 
      reference ranges of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7.
PG  - 336-41
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. CAG repeat expansions in the causative genes have been identified as 
      the basic cause of several types of SCAs, and have been used for the diagnoses 
      and classifications of patients with ataxia. In order to assess the frequency and 
      CAG repeat size ranges of SCAs, and to establish an effective strategy for 
      molecular diagnosis, we performed a molecular analysis of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      and SCA7 in 76 patients. These patients were as follows: 32 with dominant 
      inheritance, 39 sporadic cases, and 5 with unknown family histories. The normal 
      and affected CAG repeat size ranges were established at five SCA loci in Koreans, 
      which was consistent with previous reports. The total prevalence of the five 
      types of SCAs was 39.5% in the 76 patients with ataxia, regardless of their 
      family history. It was 75.0% in the 32 families with a dominant inheritance. The 
      most frequent type was SCA3 (15.8%), followed by SCA2 (14.5%). Both types 
      combined formed 76.7% of the 30 patients with CAG expansions. SCA1, SCA6, and 
      SCA7 were less frequent, affecting 3.9%, 2.6%, and 2.6% of the cases, 
      respectively. This mutation spectrum is quite different from a previous report 
      concerning Koreans, but is similar to the distributions that are seen in several 
      ethnic populations worldwide. For a correct and effective diagnosis of SCAs, we 
      suggest that a molecular diagnosis be undertaken, even in patients without a 
      family history, as well as those with a family history. A stepwise approach is 
      also recommended. Patients with ataxia should be tested for SCA2 and SCA3. 
      Individuals testing negative should be tested for SCA1, SCA6, and SCA7.

TI  - Clinical and genetic analysis of hereditary and sporadic ataxia in central Italy.
PG  - 363-6
AB  - We have clinically and genetically evaluated 24 affected patients belonging to 22 
      Italian Friedreich ataxia (FA) families, 52 patients from 32 kindreds with proven 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA), 9 patients belonging to 5 families 
      with autosomal recessive hereditary ataxia (ARCA) and 103 sporadic cases, 89 of 
      which affected by idiopathic late onset cerebellar ataxia (ILOCA). 
      Genotype-phenotype correlation analyses in FA patients have evidenced an inverse 
      relationship between GAA repeat expansion length and age of onset, disease 
      duration, and presence of cardiomyopathy. Among autosomal dominant types, 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) genotype has been found in 31% of our ADCA 
      families, resulting the most frequent form of ataxia. Phenotypic analysis of the 
      various SCA subtypes evidenced a marked heterogeneity of symptoms with a 
      substantial overlap between different syndromes.

TI  - CAG repeat instability at SCA2 locus: anchoring CAA interruptions and linked 
      single nucleotide polymorphisms.
PG  - 2437-46
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder that results from the expansion of a cryptic CAG repeat within the exon 
      1 of the SCA2 gene. The CAG repeat in normal individuals varies in length from 14 
      to 31 repeats and is frequently interrupted by one or more CAA triplets, whereas 
      the expanded alleles contain a pure uninterrupted stretch of 34 to 59 CAG 
      repeats. We have previously reported the presence of a limited pool of 
      'ancestral' or 'at risk' haplotypes for the expanded SCA2 alleles in the Indian 
      population. We now report the identification of two novel single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in exon 1 of the SCA2 gene and their characterization in 215 
      normal and 64 expanded chromosomes. The two biallelic SNPs distinguished two 
      haplotypes, GT and CC, each of which formed a predominant haplotype associated 
      with normal and expanded SCA2 alleles. All the expanded alleles segregated with 
      CC haplotype, which otherwise was associated with only 29.3% of the normal 
      chromosomes. CAA interspersion analysis revealed that majority of the normal 
      alleles with CC haplotype were either pure or lacked the most proximal 5' CAA 
      interruption. The repeat length variation at SCA2 locus also appeared to be polar 
      with changes occurring mostly at the 5' end of the repeat. Our results 
      demonstrate that CAA interruptions play an important role in conferring stability 
      to SCA2 repeat and their absence predisposes alleles towards instability and 
      pathological expansion. Our study also provides new haplotypes associated with 
      SCA2 that should prove useful in further understanding the mutational history and 
      mechanism of repeat instability at the SCA2 locus.

TI  - SCA8 repeat expansions in ataxia: a controversial association.
PG  - 1310-2
AB  - The observation of large SCA8 alleles in healthy control subjects and nonataxic 
      patients, together with a lack of segregation of the expanded repeat with ataxia 
      in several families, has raised questions about the pathogenic role of the SCA8 
      expansion. The authors found allele sizes within the proposed pathogenic range in 
      three patients with ataxia of unknown etiology, in two individuals from pedigrees 
      with either SCA2 or Friedreich's ataxia, and in two patients with Alzheimer's 
      disease. Sizing of SCA8 alleles should not be a routine diagnostic test until its 
      etiologic role is clarified and the pathogenic threshold is determined.

TI  - Frequency analysis of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias in Taiwanese patients 
      and clinical and molecular characterization of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 1105-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders. The mutational basis for most of these disorders is 
      an expanded CAG repeat sequence within the coding regions of the genes involved. 
      The prevalence of SCA in the ethnic Chinese on Taiwan remains unclear. Moreover, 
      there has been no report of SCA type 6 (SCA6) among Chinese people. OBJECTIVES: 
      To characterize the prevalence of SCA in the ethnic Chinese on Taiwan, and to 
      specifically characterize Chinese patients with SCA6 in terms of clinical and 
      molecular features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a molecular approach, we 
      investigated SCA in 74 Taiwanese families with dominantly inherited ataxias and 
      in 49 Taiwanese patients with sporadic ataxias. Clinical and molecular features 
      of SCA6 were further characterized in 12 patients from 8 families and in 2 
      sporadic cases. Furthermore, the intragenic polymorphic marker D19S1150 was 
      amplified by polymerase chain reaction to analyze for linkage disequilibrium. 
      RESULTS: Machado-Joseph disease-SCA3 was the most common type of autosomal 
      dominant SCA in the Taiwanese cohort, accounting for 35 cases (47.3%), followed 
      by SCA6 (8 [10.8%]), SCA2 (8 [10.8%]), SCA1 (4 [5.4%]), SCA7 (2 [2.7%]), 
      dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (1 [1.4%]), and SCA8 (0%). The genes 
      responsible for 16 (21.6%) of Taiwanese dominantly inherited SCA cases remain to 
      be determined. Among the 49 patients with sporadic ataxias in the present series, 
      2 (4.1%) were found to harbor SCA6 mutations. In the families with SCA6, we found 
      significant anticipation in the absence of genetic instability on transmission, 
      indicating that some other mechanism might account for the anticipation. The same 
      frequent allele of the intragenic DNA marker (D19S1150) was shared by 7 of 10 
      Taiwanese families with SCA6. CONCLUSIONS: Although SCA6 has, so far, not been 
      reported in mainland Chinese, we found a geographic cluster of families with SCA6 
      on Taiwan. Genotyping studies suggest a founder effect in the Taiwanese patients 
      with SCA6.

TI  - Restless legs syndrome in spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, and 3.
PG  - 311-4
AB  - To identify the prevalence and determinants of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) we studied 58 patients with a molecular diagnosis of 
      SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3. Data on the symptoms of RLS were collected by a standardized 
      questionnaire, and RLS was diagnosed when patients met the four minimal criteria 
      of the syndrome as recently defined by an international study group. In addition, 
      we studied the relationship between RLS and age, age at ataxia onset, CAG repeat 
      length, and nerve conduction and evoked potentials data. RLS was significantly 
      more frequent in SCA patients than in controls (28% vs. 10%). Age at RLS onset in 
      SCA was 49.0 +/- 10.9 years. There were no significant differences in nerve 
      conduction or evoked potentials between RLS and non-RLS SCA patients. The 
      probability of developing RLS increased with age but not with CAG repeat length 
      or higher age of ataxia onset. The data provide evidence that patients with SCA1, 
      SCA2 and SCA3 are per se more susceptible to RLS than non-affected individuals. 
      The probability of developing RLS is related principally to the period over which 
      the CAG repeat mutation exerts its effect and not to CAG repeat length or age of 
      ataxia onset.

TI  - Clinical features and genetic analysis of a new form of spinocerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 234-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically 
      heterogeneous group of disorders. The mutations for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, and SCA-12 are identified and caused by an expansion of a CAG or a CTG 
      repeat sequence of these genes. Six additional loci for SCA4, SCA5, SCA-10, 
      SCA-11, SCA-13, and SCA-14 are mapped. The growing heterogeneity of the autosomal 
      dominant forms of these diseases shows that the genetic etiologies of at least 
      20% of ADCA have yet to be elucidated. METHODS: The authors ascertained and 
      clinically characterized a four-generation pedigree segregating an autosomal 
      dominant phenotype for SCA. Direct mutation analysis, repeat expansion detection 
      analysis, and linkage analysis for all known SCA loci were performed. RESULTS: 
      Direct mutational analysis excluded SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 12; genetic linkage 
      analysis excluded SCA4, 5,10, 11, 13, and 14, giving significant negative lod 
      scores. Examination of the family showed that all affected members had gait 
      ataxia and akinesia with variable features of dysarthria, hyporeflexia, and mild 
      intellectual impairment. Eye movements were normal. Head MRI showed atrophy of 
      the cerebellum without involvement of the brainstem. In 10 parent-child pairs, 
      median onset occurred 10.5 years earlier in offspring than in their parents, 
      suggesting anticipation. CONCLUSION: This family is distinct from other families 
      with SCA and is characterized by cerebellar ataxia and extrapyramidal signs.

TI  - Evidence that allelic variants of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 gene 
      influence susceptibility to multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 91-6
AB  - Expanded CAG trinucleotide repeats are known to be responsible for five of the 
      autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7). We 
      have typed each of these repeats in 226 multiple sclerosis sibling pair families. 
      No expanded repeats were seen, indicating an absence of SCA phenocopies in 
      clinically defined familial multiple sclerosis. However, transmission 
      disequilibrium testing for these repeats demonstrated significant excess 
      transmission of the 22 repeat length allele of the SCA2 gene (P=4. 4E-06) in 
      multiple sclerosis patients. This observation is consistent with pleiotropic 
      effects of the SCA2 gene, with a non-dynamic mutation/polymorphism contributing 
      epistatically to susceptibility in multiple sclerosis.

TI  - Extrapyramidal motor signs in degenerative ataxias.
PG  - 1495-500
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extrapyramidal motor signs (EPS) are well-known symptoms of 
      degenerative ataxia. However, little is known about frequency and appearance of 
      EPS in subtypes of ataxia. METHODS: We characterized 311 patients with ataxia 
      clinically and genetically. Course of the disease and EPS were investigated 
      according to a standardized protocol. Diagnostic and prognostic impact of EPS in 
      subtypes of ataxia was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier plots. RESULTS: Extrapyramidal 
      motor signs occurred in all forms of ataxia, but frequency and type of EPS varied 
      between genetically and clinically defined subtypes. Postural tremor in 
      hereditary ataxias was typical for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). Dystonia 
      was generally rare in ataxias, but, if present, suggested SCA3. We observed a 
      parkinsonian variant of SCA3 in which parkinsonism was present in the beginning 
      of the disease and responded well to levodopa therapy, leading to diagnostic 
      confusion. Parkinsonism in SCA3 was independent of CAG repeat length but ran in 
      families, suggesting modifying genes. In idiopathic sporadic cerebellar ataxia 
      (ISCA), EPS are more frequent in late-onset than in early-onset forms. In 50% of 
      ISCA patients with parkinsonism, the diagnosis of multiple system atrophy 
      remained questionable because of normal autonomic function. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Extrapyramidal motor signs can help to predict the genetic subtype of ataxia. 
      Extrapyramidal motor signs were more frequent in genetic subtypes in which basal 
      ganglia affection has been demonstrated by postmortem studies. However, no type 
      of EPS was specific for an underlying mutation. In ISCA, EPS are an adverse 
      prognostic factor. Parkinsonism is especially associated with a more rapid course 
      of the disease. Arch Neurol. 2000;57:1495-1500

TI  - Genetic background of apparently idiopathic sporadic cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 132-7
AB  - Disease-causing mutations have been identified in various entities of autosomal 
      dominant ataxia and in Friedreich's ataxia. However, no molecular pathogenic 
      factor is known to cause idiopathic cerebellar ataxias. We investigated the 
      CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats causing spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 
      8 and 12, and the GAA repeat of the frataxin gene in 124 patients apparently 
      suffering from idiopathic sporadic ataxia, including 20 patients with the 
      clinical diagnosis of multiple system atrophy. Patients with a positive family 
      history, a typical Friedreich phenotype, or symptomatic ataxia were excluded. 
      Genetic analyses uncovered the most common Friedreich mutation in 10 patients 
      with an age at onset between 13 and 36 years. The SCA6 mutation was present in 
      nine patients with disease onset between 47 and 68 years of age. The CTG repeat 
      associated with SCA8 was expanded in three patients. One patient had SCA2 
      attributable to a de novo mutation from a paternally transmitted, intermediate 
      allele. We did not identify the SCA1, SCA3, SCA7 or SCA12 mutation in idiopathic 
      sporadic ataxia patients. No trinucleotide repeat expansion was detected in the 
      MSA subgroup. This study has revealed the genetic basis in 19% of apparently 
      idiopathic ataxia patients. SCA6 is the most frequent mutation in late onset 
      cerebellar ataxia. The frataxin trinucleotide expansion should be investigated in 
      all sporadic ataxia patients with onset before age 40, even when the phenotype is 
      atypical for Friedreich's ataxia.

TI  - Late-onset SCA2: 33 CAG repeats are sufficient to cause disease.
PG  - 569-72
AB  - SCA-2 is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by ataxia, slow 
      saccades, and hyporeflexia. The authors evaluated a patient with a mild balance 
      problem with a SCA-2 allele sized at 33 CAG repeats. The authors then ascertained 
      her 91 year-old mother, who showed disease onset at age 86 with an SCA-2 allele 
      of identical size. Their study indicates that 33 CAG repeats can be pathogenic at 
      the SCA-2 locus, though such an allele may produce an extremely late onset and 
      gradual rate of disease progression.

TI  - Analysis of CAG repeats in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia patients and distribution of CAG repeats at the SCA1, SCA2 
      and SCA6 loci in nine ethnic populations of eastern India.
PG  - 597-604
AB  - To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 57 unrelated 
      individuals clinically diagnosed as ataxia patients we analysed the SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci for expansion of CAG repeats. We detected CAG 
      repeat expansion in 6 patients (10.5%) at the SCA1 locus. Ten of the 57 patients 
      (17.5%) had CAG repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while four had CAG expansion 
      at the SCA3/MJD locus (7%). At the SCA6 locus there was a single patient (1.8%) 
      with 21 CAG repeats. We have not detected any patient with expansion in the SCA7 
      and DRPLA loci. To test whether the frequencies of the large normal alleles in 
      SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6 loci can reflect some light on prevalence of the subtypes of 
      SCAs we studied the CAG repeat variation in these loci in nine ethnic 
      sub-populations of eastern India from which the patients originated. We report 
      here that the frequency of large normal alleles (>31 CAG repeats) in SCA1 locus 
      to be 0.211 of 394 chromosomes studied. We also report that the frequency of 
      large normal alleles (>22 CAG repeats) at the SCA2 locus is 0.038 while at the 
      SCA6 locus frequency of large normal alleles (>13 repeats) is 0.032. We discussed 
      our data in light of the distribution of normal alleles and prevalence of SCAs in 
      the Japanese and white populations.

TI  - CAG repeat length in RAI1 is associated with age at onset variability in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2).
PG  - 1753-8
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by 
      the expansion of a polymorphic (CAG)(n) tract, which is translated into an 
      expanded polyglutamine tract in the ataxin-2 protein. Although repeat length and 
      age at disease onset are inversely related, approximately 50% of the age at onset 
      variance in SCA2 remains unexplained. Other familial factors have been proposed 
      to account for at least part of this remaining variance in the polyglutamine 
      dis-orders. The ability of polyglutamine tracts to interact with each other, as 
      well as the presence of intra-nuclear inclusions in other polyglutamine 
      disorders, led us to hypothesize that other CAG-containing proteins may interact 
      with expanded ataxin-2 and affect the rate of protein accumulation, and thus 
      influence age at onset. To test this hypothesis, we used step-wise multiple 
      linear regression to examine 10 CAG-containing genes for possible influences on 
      SCA2 age at onset. One locus, RAI1, contributed an additional 4.1% of the 
      variance in SCA2 age at onset after accounting for the effect of the SCA2 
      expanded repeat. This locus was further studied in SCA3/Machado-Joseph disease 
      (MJD), but did not have an effect on SCA3/MJD age at onset. This result 
      implicates RAI1 as a possible contributor to SCA2 neurodegeneration and raises 
      the possibility that other CAG-containing proteins may play a role in the 
      pathogenesis of other polyglutamine disorders.

TI  - Relative frequencies of CAG expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia and 
      dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy in 116 Italian families.
PG  - 31-6
AB  - Two hundred and forty-eight patients from 116 Italian families with dominant 
      ataxia were studied for CAG expansion within SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 (spinocerebellar 
      ataxia) and DRPLA (dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy) genes. Fifty-six percent 
      of the families originated from Southern, 19% from Central and 25% from Northern 
      Italy. SCA2 was the commonest mutation, accounting for 47% of the families, 
      followed by SCA1 (24%), SCA6 (2%), SCA7 (2%) and DRPLA (1%). No SCA3 family was 
      found. Twenty-four percent of the families carried a still unidentified mutation. 
      When occurrence of mutations was evaluated according to the geographic origin, 
      SCA1 was the commonest in Northern (72%), whereas SCA2 was prevalent (63%) in 
      Southern Italy. The number of CAG repeats in SCA1 normal alleles was higher in 
      Northern than in Central-Southern Italy.

TI  - Prevalence of triplet repeat expansion in ataxia patients from Hokkaido, the 
      northernmost island of Japan.
PG  - 45-51
AB  - Approximately 44% of cases of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) in Hokkaido, the 
      northernmost island of Japan, were estimated to be inherited. To determine the 
      prevalence of triplet repeat expansion in hereditary SCA patients, we genotyped 
      seven genetically defined dominant SCAs in 349 patients, including 266 patients 
      from 77 families, 78 probands from unrelated families with hereditary late-onset 
      SCA, and five patients in whom a family history of SCA was not demonstrated. The 
      frequency of each disorder in a total of 155 unrelated families was 23.9% for 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), 29.0% for SCA6, 9.7% for SCA1, 7.7% for SCA2, and 
      2.6% for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. Abnormal expansion of triplet 
      repeats for SCA7 and SCA8 was not detected. A total of 27.1% of the patients had 
      still unknown SCA mutations. In addition, the GAA repeat in the frataxin gene was 
      not abnormally expanded in 13 early-onset SCA patients with clinical features 
      similar to those of Friedreich ataxia. Comparison of our results with those from 
      other centers handling SCA showed that MJD is prevalent throughout Japan, but the 
      frequencies of other dominant SCAs differ considerably even within Japan.

TI  - Frequency of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, and DRPLA CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in patients with hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia from Chinese 
      kindreds.
PG  - 540-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of SCA1 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 1), SCA2, 
      SCA3/MJD (spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, and 
      DRPLA (dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy) CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions 
      [(CAG)n] among persons diagnosed with hereditary SCA from Chinese families. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, 
      and DRPLA (CAG)n mutation were detected with the polymerase chain reaction, 
      highly denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and silver staining 
      technique in 167 patients with autosomal dominant SCA from 85 Chinese families 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA. RESULTS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (CAG)n 
      mutation in 7 patients from 4 kindreds (4.70%) was expanded to 53 to 62 repeats. 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (CAG)n mutation in 12 patients from 5 kindreds 
      (5.88%) was expanded to 42 to 47 repeats. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3/Machado-Joseph disease (CAG)n mutation in 83 patients from 41 kindreds (48.23%) 
      was expanded to 68 to 83 repeats. Sixty-five patients from 35 kindreds (41.19%) 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA did not test positive for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, 
      SCA6, SCA7, or DRPLA. There was a predictable inverse relationship between the 
      number of CAG repeats and the age at onset for SCA3/MJD and SCA2. Clinically, 
      dementia and hyporeflexia were more frequent in patients with SCA2, while 
      spasticity, hyperreflexia, and Babinski signs were more frequent in patients with 
      SCA3/ MJD, and those might be helpful in clinical work to primarily distinguish 
      patients with SCA3/MJD and SCA2 from others with different types of SCA. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of SCA3/MJD is substantially higher than that of SCA1 
      and SCA2 in patients with autosomal dominant SCA from Chinese kindreds, who are 
      non-Portuguese. Clinical expressions of the various types of SCAs overlap one 
      another; therefore, for clinical study it is important to make a gene diagnosis 
      and genetic classification for patients with SCA.

TI  - Absence of unidentified CAG repeat expansion in patients with Huntington's 
      disease-like phenotype.
PG  - 672-5
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by an expanded (CAG)n repeat on the huntingtin gene. It is characterised 
      by motor, psychiatric and cognitive disturbances. Diagnosis can be confirmed by 
      direct genetic testing, which is highly sensitive and specific and is now 
      considered definitive. This study focused on 21 patients presenting with a 
      clinical phenotype showing strong similarity to HD, but who do not have an 
      expanded CAG in the huntingtin gene. However, other possible diagnoses could be 
      evoked for most of them. Seven patients (3.5% of our cohort) could be considered 
      as phenocopies of HD with no alternative diagnosis. Samples were screened for 
      other triplet repeat diseases with similar presentation (DRPLA, SCA-1, SCA-2, 
      SCA-3, SCA-6, and SCA-7) and were all negative. The repeat expansion detection 
      technique (RED) was used to detect uncloned CAG repeat expansions and samples 
      were also analysed by polymerase chain reaction for expansions of the polymorphic 
      CAG-ERDA-1 and CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeats. RED expansion (>40 repeats) was 
      detected in only one patient. The results suggest that unstable CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions corresponding to known or unknown sequences are not involved in the 
      aetiology of HD-like disorders. It is hypothesised that some of these phenocopies 
      could correspond to mutations in other unidentified genes with other unstable 
      repeats (different from CAG) or in unknown genes with other mutations.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 in seven Korean families: CAG trinucleotide 
      expansion and clinical characteristics.
PG  - 659-64
AB  - Studies on spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) have been hampered by a lack of disease 
      markers. Clinical and pathological heterogeneity also made the classification 
      unreliable. Linkage studies established that there are multiple subtypes of SCA. 
      Five types are found to have unstable CAG expansion; the diagnosis can be 
      established by molecular genetic study. Therefore, we systemically screened 
      degenerative ataxia patients for these five SCA types, and identified eight 
      patients with SCA2 (seven from six families and one sporadic case). This paper 
      presents the clinical information on the seven patients, whose clinical 
      information was available in detail. CAG repeat expansion in the patients ranged 
      from 38 to 47 (normal control, 19 to 27). The onset ages ranged from 16 to 41 
      with 27.1 years as the mean, which correlated inversely with repeat lengths. All 
      patients presented dysarthria and gait ataxia. Upper limb dysmetria or 
      dysdiadochokinesia appeared later but progressed, causing severe disability. Slow 
      saccade (4 patients in 7) and decreased DTR (4 in 7) were common. MRIs showed 
      severe atrophy of the brainstem and cerebellum in all patients. We conclude that 
      SCA2 is the most frequent type in Korea and carries rather pure cerebellar 
      syndrome, slow saccade, and hyporeflexia.

TI  - A common disease haplotype segregating in spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) 
      pedigrees of diverse ethnic origin.
PG  - 841-5
AB  - The identification of a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion, located within the 
      coding sequence of the ataxin-2 gene, as the mutation underlying spinocerebellar 
      ataxia 2 (SCA2) has facilitated direct investigation of pedigrees previously 
      excluded from linkage analysis due to insufficient size or pedigree structure. We 
      have previously described the identification of the ancestral disease haplotype 
      segregating in the Cuban founder population used to assign the disease locus to 
      chromosome 12q23-24.1. We now report evidence for the segregation of the 
      identical core haplotype in pedigrees of diverse ethnic origin from India, Japan 
      and England, established by the analysis of the loci D12S1672 and D12S1333 
      located 20kb proximal and 200 kb distal to the triplet repeat motif respectively. 
      Interpretation of this data is suggestive that for these pedigrees at least, the 
      mutation has arisen on a single ancestral or predisposing chromosome.

TI  - Mosaicism of unstable CAG repeats in the brain of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2.
PG  - 835-9
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is caused by expansion of unstable CAG 
      repeats within the coding region of the novel gene, ataxin-2, on chromosome 
      12q24.1. We analyzed CAG repeat size of the SCA2 allele in two deceased patients 
      (father and daughter) to investigate the repeat mosaicism in CNS regions. The CAG 
      repeat size was examined using lymphoblastoid cell lines, frozen brain tissues, 
      and paraffin-embedded tissues. In each patient the major repeat size of the 
      expanded allele varied within the brain or spinal cord (father, 39-42; daughter, 
      39-47 repeats), and was smaller by three to eight repeats in the cerebellum than 
      in other CNS regions. Our results are in agreement with the findings in other 
      polyglutamine disorders showing somatic mosaicism.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I: oculomotor abnormalities in families 
      with SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3.
PG  - 789-97
AB  - Forty-six patients suffering from autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I 
      (ADCA I) underwent to a genotype-phenotype correlation analysis by molecular 
      genetic assignment to the spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, 2, or 3 (SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3) genetic locus and electro-oculography. Oculomotor deficits that are 
      attributed to dysfunction of cerebellar structures occurred in all three 
      mutations without major differences between the groups. Gaze-evoked nystagmus, 
      however, was not found to be associated with SCA2. Square wave jerks were 
      exclusively observed in SCA3. The gain in vestibulo-ocular reflex was 
      significantly impaired in SCA3 and SCA1. In SCA3 the severity of vestibular 
      impairment increased with CAG repeat length. Severe saccade slowing was a highly 
      characteristic feature of SCA2. In SCA3 saccade velocity was normal to mildly 
      reduced while SCA1 fell into an intermediate range. The present data show that 
      each mutation is associated with a distinct syndrome of oculomotor deficits. 
      Reduced saccade velocity and the absence of both square-wave jerks and 
      gaze-evoked nystagmus allow one SCA2 to be distinguished from SCA3 patients in 
      almost all cases. The eye movement disorder of SCA1 patients, however, overlaps 
      with both SCA2 and SCA3.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias in Spanish patients: genetic analysis of familial and 
      sporadic cases. The Ataxia Study Group.
PG  - 516-22
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically heterogeneous group 
      of neurodegenerative disorders caused by unstable CAG repeat expansions encoding 
      polyglutamine tracts. Five spinocerebellar ataxia genes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 
      and SCA7) and another related dominant ataxia gene (DRPLA) have been cloned, 
      allowing the genetic classification of these disorders. We present here the 
      molecular analysis of 87 unrelated familial and 60 sporadic Spanish cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia. For ADCA cases 15% were SCA2, 15% SCA3, 6% SCA1, 3% SCA7, 
      1% SCA6 and 1% DRPLA, an extremely rare mutation in Caucasoid populations. About 
      58% of ADCA cases remained genetically unclassified. All the SCA1 cases belong to 
      the same geographical area and share a common haplotype for the SCA1 mutation. 
      The expanded alleles ranged from 41 to 59 repeats for SCA1, 35 to 46 [corrected] 
      for SCA2, 67 to 77 for SCA3, and 38 to 113 for SCA7. One SCA6 case had 25 repeats 
      and one DRPLA case had 63 repeats. The highest CAG repeat variation in meiotic 
      transmission of expanded alleles was detected in SCA7, this being of +67 units in 
      one paternal transmission and giving rise to a 113 CAG repeat allele in a patient 
      who died at 3 years of age. Meiotic transmissions have also shown a tendency to 
      more frequent paternal transmission of expanded alleles in SCA1 and maternal in 
      SCA7. All SCA1 and SCA2 expanded alleles analyzed consisted of pure CAG repeats, 
      whereas normal alleles were interrupted by 1-2 CAT trinucleotides in SCA1, except 
      for three alleles of 6, 14 and 21 CAG repeats, and by 1-3 CAA trinucleotides in 
      SCA2. No SCA or DRPLA mutations were detected in the 60 sporadic cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia, but one late onset patient was identified as a recessive 
      form due to GAA-repeat expansions in the Friedreich's ataxia gene.

TI  - Cognitive deficits in spinocerebellar ataxia 2.
PG  - 769-77
AB  - This is one of the first studies assessing the pattern of cognitive impairment in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2). Cognitive function was studied in 17 patients 
      with genetically confirmed SCA2 and 15 age- and IQ- matched controls using a 
      neuropsychological test battery comprising tests for IQ, attention, verbal and 
      visuospatial memory, as well as executive functions. Twenty-five percent of the 
      SCA2 subjects showed evidence of dementia. Even in non-demented SCA2 subjects, 
      there was evidence of verbal memory and executive dysfunction. Tests of 
      visuospatial memory and attention were not significantly impaired in the 
      non-demented group compared with controls. There was no relationship between test 
      performance and motor disability, repeat length or age of onset, while disease 
      duration was shown to be inversely correlated with two tests reflecting the 
      progression of cognitive deficits during the course of the disease. Intellectual 
      impairment should therefore not be interpreted as a secondary effect of 
      progressive motor disability, but represents an important and independent part of 
      the SCA2 phenotype.

TI  - Clinical and molecular analysis of 11 Sicilian SCA2 families: influence of gender 
      on age at onset.
PG  - 301-7
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) are a complex group of slowly 
      progressive neurodegenerative disorders characterized by gait and stance ataxia, 
      dysarthria and other symptoms of nervous system involvement. ADCA type I is the 
      commonest form and is genetically heterogeneous; several loci have been 
      identified. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) has been mapped to chromosome 
      12, with expanded cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats being identified as the 
      mutational cause of the disease. We investigated 15 families, all originating 
      from mid-eastern Sicily, with ADCA type I; molecular studies performed in 12 
      families showed the SCA2 mutation to be present in 11 of them (91.6%) - the 
      highest occurrence so far reported in the literature. The CAG repeat of the 
      affected alleles varied between 34 and 44 repeats. Age at onset and repeat length 
      revealed an inverse correlation. Mean age at onset was 37.32 +/- 16. 74 years, 
      and occurred earlier in males than in females. There were no differences in mean 
      CAG repeat units between the sexes. However, a higher instability of CAG repeats 
      was observed for paternal transmission than for maternal transmission. Age at 
      onset and anticipation were not related to parental transmission. Our data 
      suggest that in SCA2 an unknown sex-linked factor may play a role in the 
      modulation of toxic effects of the polyglutamine tract.

TI  - Eleven trinucleotide repeat loci that map to chromosome 12 excluded from 
      involvement in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder.
PG  - 67-70
AB  - The hypothesis that one or more genes containing expanded trinucleotide repeats 
      contribute to the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder has received support from 
      three independent studies demonstrating that bipolar patients tend to have larger 
      CAG/CTG repeat expansion detection products than controls. In an attempt to 
      identify the specific expanded CAG/CTG locus or loci which are associated with 
      bipolar disorder, we determined repeat size at CAG/CTG loci mapping to candidate 
      regions for bipolar disorder. Recent linkage studies suggest the existence of a 
      bipolar susceptibility gene on chromosome 12q23-q24.1 in the region of the 
      Darier's disease (DAR) gene. In this study we report our findings from 11 loci 
      which map to chromosome 12, including CAG repeat polymorphisms within the genes 
      SCA2 and ASH1. We conclude that all of these loci are excluded as candidates for 
      CAG/CTG repeat expansion in bipolar disorder.

TI  - Mapping of a new autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia to chromosome 22.
PG  - 594-9
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) are a clinically and 
      genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. The clinical symptoms include 
      cerebellar dysfunction and associated signs from dysfunction in other parts of 
      the nervous system. So far, five spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) genes have been 
      identified: SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7. Loci for SCA4 and SCA5 have been 
      mapped. However, approximately one-third of SCAs have remained unassigned. We 
      have identified a Mexican American pedigree that segregates a new form of ataxia 
      clinically characterized by gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus. Two 
      individuals have seizures. After excluding all known genetic loci for linkage, we 
      performed a genomewide search and identified linkage to a 15-cM region on 
      chromosome 22q13. A maximum LOD score of 4.3 (recombination fraction 0) was 
      obtained for D22S928 and D22S1161. This distinct form of ataxia has been 
      designated "SCA10." Anticipation was observed in the available parent-child 
      pairs, suggesting that trinucleotide-repeat expansion may be the mutagenic 
      mechanism.

TI  - Incidence of dominant spinocerebellar and Friedreich triplet repeats among 361 
      ataxia families.
PG  - 1666-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 
      3, 6, and 7 and Friedreich's ataxia (FA) among a large panel of ataxia families. 
      BACKGROUND: The ataxias are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative diseases that variably affect the cerebellum, brainstem, and 
      spinocerebellar tracts. Trinucleotide repeat expansions have been shown to be the 
      mutational mechanism for five dominantly inherited SCAs as well as FA. METHODS: 
      We collected DNA samples and clinical data from patients representing 361 
      families with adult-onset ataxia of unknown etiology. Patients with a clinical 
      diagnosis of FA were specifically excluded from our collection. RESULTS: Among 
      the 178 dominant kindreds, we found SCA1 expansion at a frequency of 5.6%, SCA2 
      expansion at a frequency of 15.2%, SCA3 expansion at a frequency of 20.8%, SCA6 
      expansion at a frequency of 15.2%, and SCA7 expansion at a frequency of 4.5%. FA 
      alleles were found in 11.4% of apparently recessive and 5.2% of apparently 
      sporadic patients. Among these patients the repeat sizes for one or both FA 
      alleles were relatively small, with sizes for the smaller allele ranging from 90 
      to 600 GAA repeats. The clinical presentation for these patients is atypical for 
      FA, with one or more of the following characteristics: adult onset of disease, 
      retained tendon reflexes, normal plantar response, and intact or partially intact 
      sensory perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogenic trinucleotide repeat expansions were 
      found among 61% of the dominant kindreds. Among patients with apparently 
      recessive or negative family histories of ataxia, 6.8% and 4.4% tested positive 
      for a CAG expansion at one of the dominant loci, and 11.4 and 5.2% of patients 
      with apparently recessive or sporadic forms of ataxia had FA expansions. Because 
      of the significant implications that a dominant versus recessive inheritance 
      pattern has for future generations, it is important to screen patients who do not 
      have a clearly dominant inheritance pattern for expansions at both the FA and the 
      dominant ataxia loci.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA 2) in an infant with extreme CAG repeat 
      expansion.
PG  - 383-7
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders that generally present in adulthood. Spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 2 typically presents with progressive cerebellar symptoms, slow 
      ocular saccades, and peripheral neuropathy. The onset of symptoms is usually 
      between 20 and 40 years. We describe an infant who presented with neonatal 
      hypotonia, developmental delay, and dysphagia. Ocular findings of retinitis 
      pigmentosa were noted at 10 months. Her father had mild spinocerebellar ataxia 
      first noted at age 22 years. Molecular studies of the SCA2 gene showed a CAG 
      expansion of 43 repeats in the father and an extreme CAG repeat expansion of more 
      than 200 in the baby. Our report expands the known phenotype and genotype of 
      SCA2. Testing for dominant ataxias should be included in the evaluation of 
      infants with nonspecific progressive neurologic symptoms and retinitis 
      pigmentosa, especially in cases with a positive family history for 
      spinocerebellar ataxia.

TI  - CAG repeat length and clinical features in three Italian families with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2): early impairment of Wisconsin Card Sorting 
      Test and saccade velocity.
PG  - 647-52
AB  - We report on the clinical, neuropsychological, neurophysiological, computerized 
      eye movement, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and molecular findings from 17 
      individuals affected with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) belonging to three 
      families. The average age at onset of the symptoms was 35.6, 11.9 (mean, SD) 
      years. The mean age at onset of the symptoms in the parents was 44.8, 8.2 years, 
      and in the offspring it was 28.7, 7.2 years. In 12 parent-child pairs, the mean 
      anticipation was -15.75, 9.1 years (range -8.1 to -23.3 years, t = -4.9, P = < 
      0.002). The mutated SCA2 alleles ranged from 38 to 42 CAG repeats, while the 
      normal alleles ranged from 22 to 24 repeats, with 97% of the alleles having 22 
      repeats. Small differences in the number of CAG repeats influenced the age at 
      onset and rate of progression of the disease considerably. Indeed, patients 
      presenting with their first symptom at an age of 35 years or later with a slower 
      course of the disease harboured between 38 and 39 repeats. In contrast, patients 
      carrying > or = 40 CAG repeats manifested the disease prior to 30 years of age 
      and had a faster disease progression toward incapacity. The presenting symptom 
      was always gait ataxia. Slow saccades occured from the beginning of the disease 
      despite normal delay, accuracy and smooth pursuit eye movements. The 
      neuropsychological study showed early and selective impairment of conceptual 
      reasoning ability, as detected by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). It is 
      noteworthy that a significant mutual relationship was observed between 
      performance on the WCST and saccade velocity. All of these findings favour the 
      hypothesis that the disease process of SCA2 in regions other than the cerebellum 
      and brain stem affects severely and early those cortical structures involved in 
      the control of both visually guided saccades and WCST performance.

PG  - 1687-93
AB  - Twenty-six patients suffering from autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I 
      were subjected to a genotype-phenotype correlation analysis using molecular 
      genetic assignment to the genetic loci for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, 2 or 3 
      (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3) and MRI-based volumetry of posterior fossa structures and 
      basal ganglia nuclei. There was significant atrophy of the cerebellum and 
      brainstem in all three SCA mutations compared with a group of 31 age- and 
      sex-matched controls. Comparison between the SCA groups showed that cerebellar 
      and brainstem atrophy was more severe in SCA2 than in SCA1 and SCA3. Putaminal 
      and caudate volume was reduced only in SCA3, but not in SCA1 and SCA2. A set of 
      three morphological criteria was defined that enabled us to assign all SCA2 and 
      SCA3 patients correctly to the underlying genotype. In contrast, these criteria 
      did not distinguish SCA1 from SCA2 and SCA3. Regression analysis failed to reveal 
      a significant association between CAG repeat length and the volumes of the 
      respective brain structures in any of the SCA mutant types. The present data 
      provide in vivo evidence that SCA2 and SCA3 lead to distinct patterns of brain 
      atrophy, while the atrophy changes in SCA1 overlap with both SCA2 and SCA3.

TI  - Close associations between prevalences of dominantly inherited spinocerebellar 
      ataxias with CAG-repeat expansions and frequencies of large normal CAG alleles in 
      Japanese and Caucasian populations.
PG  - 1060-6
AB  - To test the hypothesis that the frequencies of normal alleles (ANs) with a 
      relatively large number of CAG repeats (large ANs) are related to the prevalences 
      of the dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs)-SCA types 1, 2, 3 (Machado-Joseph 
      disease), 6, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA)-we investigated the 
      relative prevalences of these diseases in 202 Japanese and 177 Caucasian families 
      and distributions of the number of CAG repeats of ANs at these disease loci in 
      normal individuals in each population. The relative prevalences of SCA1 and SCA2 
      were significantly higher in Caucasian pedigrees (15% and 14%, respectively) than 
      in Japanese pedigrees (3% and 5%, respectively), corresponding to the observation 
      that the frequencies of large ANs of SCA1 (alleles >30 repeats) and of SCA2 
      (alleles >22 repeats) were significantly higher in Caucasians than in Japanese. 
      The relative prevalences of MJD/SCA3, SCA6, and DRPLA were significantly higher 
      in Japanese pedigrees (43%, 11%, and 20%, respectively) than in Caucasian 
      pedigrees (30%, 5%, and 0%, respectively), corresponding to the observation that 
      the frequencies of large ANs of MJD/SCA3 (>27 repeats), SCA6 (>13 repeats), and 
      DRPLA (>17 repeats) were significantly higher in Japanese than in Caucasians. The 
      close correlations of the relative prevalences of the dominant SCAs with the 
      distributions of large ANs strongly support the assumption that large ANs 
      contribute to generation of expanded alleles (AEs) and the relative prevalences 
      of the dominant SCAs.

TI  - CAG repeat expansion in an italian family with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      (SCA2): a clinical and genetic study.
PG  - 164-8
AB  - We report an Italian family in which molecular genetic analysis showed expansion 
      of CAG repeats indicative of the SCA2 genotype. This family confirms that ataxia, 
      ophthalmoparesis and sensory peripheral neuropathy are the salient features of 
      the SCA2 phenotype. In the present cases, early onset and mental deterioration 
      were important additional findings. Nerve biopsy findings were compatible with a 
      chronic axonopathy. We found a direct correlation between length of triplet 
      expansion and severity of the clinical symptoms. Of particular interest is the 
      late-onset phenotypical expression in a patient with 34 repeats.

TI  - Phenotype variation correlates with CAG repeat length in SCA2--a study of 28 
      Japanese patients.
PG  - 202-8
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia-2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominant ataxia caused by an 
      abnormal CAG repeat expansion in a novel gene on chromosome 12q24.1. The size of 
      the mutant allele is unstable during transmission, and correlates inversely with 
      age at onset. We studied eight Japanese SCA2 families, including 28 patients, to 
      assess the effect of repeat length on the phenotype features of SCA2. Frequencies 
      of slow eye movements (SEM), reflex activity, dementia, choreiform movements, and 
      axial tremor correlated significantly with CAG repeat size. Parkinsonism was seen 
      in a man homozygote for SCA2 mutation. The clinical variety of SCA2 is apparently 
      influenced by the size of the mutant allele, as is the case in other CAG repeat 
      disorders.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 in China: molecular analysis and genotype-phenotype 
      correlation in nine families.
PG  - 595-8
AB  - Sixteen patients from nine Chinese families with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      (SCA2) were heterozygous for a CAG repeat expansion in the SCA2 gene containing 
      37 to 56 repeats, whereas the normal alleles carried 14 to 28 repeats. One or two 
      CAA triplets within the CAG tract were seen in normal, but not in the expanded 
      alleles. A strong inverse correlation was established between the number of CAG 
      repeats and the age of disease onset. SCA2 accounted for 12% of the known Chinese 
      families with spinocerebellar ataxia.

TI  - CAG repeat expansions in patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 55-9
AB  - CAG repeat expansions cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), SCA2, SCA3, 
      SCA6 and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). So far these expansions 
      have been examined mainly in ataxia patients with a family history. However, some 
      sporadic cases with SCA have recently been reported. To elucidate the frequency 
      and characteristics of sporadic SCAs, we screened 85 Japanese ataxia patients 
      without a family history for the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and DRPLA mutations. As a 
      result, 19 patients (22%) were found to have expanded CAG repeats. Among sporadic 
      SCAs, the SCA6 mutation was most frequently observed. The sporadic SCA6 patients 
      had smaller CAG repeats and a later age of onset than SCA6 patients with an 
      established family history. We also identified one father-child pair in which 
      intermediate sized CAG repeats expanded into the SCA2 disease range during 
      transmission. These findings suggest that patients with ataxia even without a 
      family history should be examined for a CAG repeat expansion.

TI  - Patients with features similar to Huntington's disease, without CAG expansion in 
      huntingtin.
PG  - 215-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe characteristics of gene-negative patients with clinical 
      features of Huntington's disease (HD), exploring likely etiologies. BACKGROUND: 
      When a direct gene test became definitive for diagnosis of HD, we discovered a 
      number of patients in our clinics in Baltimore, MD, and Cambridge, UK, believed 
      or suspected to have HD who did not have the triplet repeat expansion. METHODS: 
      Patients were examined using standardized instruments, and given full neurologic 
      and psychiatric evaluations. Those negative for HD were tested for 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy, SCA-1, SCA-3, SCA-2, SCA-6, and other 
      conditions as indicated. RESULTS: Of 15 patients, 7 received specific diagnoses 
      or appear to be sporadic cases, 4 have a possible but uncertain relation to HD, 
      and 4 have unknown familial progressive movement disorders. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      last group of patients might be properly described as phenocopies of HD, some of 
      which may be caused by unidentified triplet repeat expansions.

TI  - Analysis of SCA1, DRPLA, MJD, SCA2, and SCA6 CAG repeats in 48 Portuguese ataxia 
      families.
PG  - 134-8
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are clinically and genetically a heterogeneous 
      group of neurodegenerative disorders. To date, eight different loci causing SCA 
      have been identified: SCA1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA4, SCA5, 
      SCA6, SCA7, and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). Expansion of a CAG 
      repeat in the disease genes has been found in five of these disorders. To 
      estimate the relative frequencies of the SCA1, DRPLA, MJD, SCA2, and SCA6 
      mutations among Portuguese ataxia patients, we collected DNA samples from 48 
      ataxia families and performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of 
      the CAG repeat mutations on chromosomes 6p, 12p, 14q, 12q, and 19p, respectively. 
      Fifty-five individuals belonging to 34 dominant families (74%) had an expanded 
      CAG repeat at the MJD gene. In five individuals from two kindreds with a dominant 
      pattern of inheritance (4%), an expanded CAG repeat at the SCA2 gene was found. 
      In MJD patients, the normal allele size ranged from 13 to 41, whereas the mutant 
      alleles contained 65 to 80 repeats. For the SCA2 patients, normal alleles had 22 
      or 23, while expanded alleles had between 36 and 47 CAG units. We did not find 
      the SCA1, DRPLA, or SCA6 mutations in our group of families. The MJD mutation 
      remains the most common cause of SCA in Portugal, while a small number of cases 
      are caused by mutations at the SCA2 gene, and 22% are due to still unidentified 
      genes.

TI  - Analysis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 in Gunma Prefecture in Japan: CAG 
      trinucleotide expansion and clinical characteristics.
PG  - 180-5
AB  - We analyzed 13 patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) in seven 
      unrelated families who live in Gunma Prefecture, Japan (population approx. 
      2,000,000), and documented the clinical and molecular properties correlated with 
      the CAG repeat expansion. Twelve of the 13 patients and one presymptomatic female 
      were genetically examined, and the CAG repeat number of the expanded and normal 
      alleles was 40.8+/-4.8 (mean+/-S.D., n=13) and 22+/-0 (n=13), respectively. The 
      repeat size of the expanded alleles was inversely correlated with the patients' 
      age at onset. Paternal anticipation was observed, accompanied by an increase of 
      the CAG repeat size. The patients presented here were clinically characterized by 
      a relatively higher frequency of slow saccades, hyporeflexia, hypotonia, and 
      tremor. A number of peaks in the expanded allele on polyacrylamide gel 
      electrophoresis showed the presence of cell mosaicism in SCA2 as well. In Gunma 
      Prefecture, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 are 
      almost equally present and at higher frequencies than spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      1 and hereditary dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy, which are rare. Thus, the 
      difference of frequency of autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias may be 
      present in Japan.

TI  - The natural history of degenerative ataxia: a retrospective study in 466 
      patients.
PG  - 589-600
AB  - The aim of the present study was (i) to compare disease progression and survival 
      in different types of degenerative ataxia, and (ii) to identify variables that 
      may modify the rate of disease progression. We included patients suffering from 
      Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA, n = 83), early onset cerebellar ataxia (EOCA, n = 30), 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) type I (ADCA-I, n = 273), ADCA-III (n 
      = 13) and multiple system atrophy (MSA, n = 67). Molecular genetic testing 
      allowed us to assign 202 ADCA-I patients to one of the following subgroups: 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type I (SCAI, n = 36), SCA2 (n = 56) and SCA3 (n = 110). 
      To assess disease progression we defined the following disease stages: stage 0 = 
      no gait difficulties; stage 1 = disease onset, as defined by onset of gait 
      difficulties; stage 2 = loss of independent gait; stage 3 = confinement to 
      wheelchair; stage 4 = death. Disease progression was most rapid in MSA, 
      intermediate in FRDA, ADCA-I and ADCA-III and slowest in EOCA. The rate of 
      progression was similar in SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3. The CAG repeat length was a 
      significant risk factor for faster progression in SCA2 and SCA3, but not in SCA1. 
      In FRDA, the time until confinement to wheelchair was shorter in patients with 
      earlier disease onset, suggesting that patients with long GAA repeats and early 
      disease onset have a poor prognosis. Female gender increased the risk of becoming 
      dependent on walking aids or a wheelchair, but it did not influence survival in 
      FRDA, SCA3 and MSA. In SCA2, female gender was associated with shortened 
      survival. In MSA, later age of onset increased the risk of rapid progression and 
      death.

TI  - The role of the SCA2 trinucleotide repeat expansion in 89 autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia families. Frequency, clinical and genetic correlates.
PG  - 459-67
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is caused by a trinucleotide (CAG) 
      expansion in the coding region of the ataxin 2 gene on chromosome 12q.89 families 
      with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) types I, II and III, and 47 
      isolated cases with idiopathic late onset cerebellar ataxia (ILOCA), were 
      analysed for this mutation. The identification of the SCA2 mutation in 31 out of 
      38 families with the ADCA I phenotype, but in none of those with ADCA II, ADCA 
      III or ILOCA confirms the specificity of this mutation. A clinical comparison of 
      the ADCA I patients with the three known mutations (SCA1, -2 or -3) highlights 
      significant differences between the groups; SCA2 patients tended to have a longer 
      disease duration, a higher frequency of slow saccades and depressed tendon 
      reflexes. However, these neurological signs were also seen in an ADCA I family in 
      which the SCA2 mutation was not identified, illustrating the importance of a 
      direct genetic test. The SCA2 families were from different geographical and 
      ethnic backgrounds. However, haplotype analysis failed to show evidence of a 
      founder mutation, even in families from the same geographical origin. The range 
      of normal alleles varied from 17 to 30 CAG repeats and from 35 to 51 repeats for 
      the pathological alleles. Similar to the other diseases caused by unstable 
      trinucleotide repeats, a significant inverse correlation has been found between 
      the number of repeats and age of onset, and there is a significantly higher 
      paternal instability of repeat length on transmission to offspring. The SCA2 
      mutation is the most frequent amongst ADCA I patients, accounting for 40%, 
      compared with SCA1 and SCA3 which account for 35% and 15%, respectively.

TI  - Uncloned expanded CAG/CTG repeat sequences in autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia (ADCA) detected by the repeat expansion detection (RED) method.
PG  - 99-102
AB  - In some neurodegenerative diseases, genetic anticipation correlates with 
      expansions of the CAG/CTG repeat sequence above the normal range through the 
      generations of a pedigree. Among these neurodegenerative diseases are late onset 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA). ADCA are genetically heterogeneous 
      disorders with different cloned genes for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), 
      type 2 (SCA2), type 3 or Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), and type 6 (SCA6). 
      Another related dominant ataxia, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), 
      also shows CAG/CTG repeat expansions. Genetic anticipation has been reported for 
      all of them except for the recently cloned SCA6 gene. Other, as yet undetected 
      SCA genes may show the same features. We have used the repeat expansion detection 
      (RED) method to detect repeat expansions directly in DNA samples from ADCA 
      patients not resulting from known genes. Our sample consists of 19 affected index 
      cases, corresponding to 52.8% of our ADCA families without CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions in the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, or DRPLA genes. Eighty-nine percent 
      of the index cases had expansions of a CAG/CTG sequence greater than 40 repeats 
      by RED, while these were observed in only 26.9% of 78 healthy subjects from the 
      general population (p < 0.0001). The distribution of RED fragments in controls 
      and ADCA patients also shows significant differences with the Mann-Whitney U test 
      (U = 376.5, p = 0.0007). Moreover, there was a significant inverse correlation 
      between the size of expansion and the age of onset (r = -0.54, p = 0.018). These 
      results show CAG/CTG repeat expansions of over 40 repeats in our sample of ADCA 
      families not resulting from known SCA genes.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6: genotype and phenotype in German kindreds.
PG  - 67-73
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is an autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) of which the mutation causing the disease has recently 
      been characterised as an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the gene coding for 
      the alpha1A-subunit of the voltage dependent calcium channel. The aim was to 
      further characterise the SCA6 phenotype METHODS: The SCA6 mutation was 
      investigated in 69 German families with ADCA and 61 patients with idiopathic 
      sporadic cerebellar ataxia and the CAG repeat length of the expanded allele was 
      correlated with the disease phenotype. RESULTS: Expanded alleles were found in 
      nine of 69 families as well as in four patients with sporadic disease. Disease 
      onset ranged from 30 to 71 years of age and was significantly later than in other 
      forms of ADCA. Age at onset correlated inversely with repeat length. The SCA6 
      phenotype comprises predominantly cerebellar signs in concordance with isolated 
      cerebellar atrophy on MRI. Non-cerebellar systems were only mildly affected with 
      external ophthalmoplegia, spasticity, peripheral neuropathy, and parkinsonism. 
      Neither these clinical signs nor progression rate correlated with CAG repeat 
      length. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first detailed characterisation of 
      the SCA6 phenotype. Clinical features apart from cerebellar signs were highly 
      variable in patients with SCA6. By comparison with SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 no 
      clinical or electrophysiological finding was specific for SCA6. Therefore, the 
      molecular defect cannot be predicted from clinical investigations. In Germany, 
      SCA6 accounts for about 13% of families with ADCA. However, up to 30% of SCA6 
      kindreds may be misdiagnosed clinically as sporadic disease due to late 
      manifestation in apparently healthy parents. Genetic testing is therefore 
      recommended for the SCA6 mutation also in patients with putative sporadic ataxia.

TI  - Polymorphisms at 13 expressed human sequences containing CAG/CTG repeats and 
      analysis in autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) patients.
PG  - 18-21
AB  - Genetic anticipation--increasing severity and a decrease in the age of onset with 
      successive generations of a pedigree--is clearly present in autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia (ADCA). Anticipation is correlated with expansion of the 
      CAG/CTG repeat sequence to sizes above those in the normal range through the 
      generations of a pedigree. Genetic heterogeneity has been demonstrated for ADCA, 
      with four cloned genes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, and SCA6) and three mapped loci 
      (SCA4, SCA5 and SCA7). Another related dominant ataxia, 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), presents anticipation with CAG/CTG 
      repeat expansions. We had previously analysed ADCA patients who had not shown 
      repeat expansions in cloned genes for CAG/CTG repeat expansions by the repeat 
      expansion detection method (RED) and had detected expansions of between 48 and 88 
      units in 17 unrelated familial cases. We present here an analysis of 13 genes and 
      expressed sequence tags (ESTs) containing 10 or more CAG/CTG repeat sequences 
      selected from public databases in the 17 unrelated ADCA patients. Of the 13 
      selected genes and ESTs, 9 were found to be polymorphic with heterozygosities 
      ranging between 0.09 and 0.80 and 2 to 17 alleles. In ADCA patients none of the 
      loci showed expansions above the normal range of the CAG/CTG repeat sequences, 
      excluding them as the mutation causing ADCA.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia: phenotypic differences in genetically 
      defined subtypes?
PG  - 924-32
AB  - Seventy-seven families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia were analyzed 
      for the CAG repeat expansions causing spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 
      and 6. The SCA1 mutation accounted for 9%, SCA2 for 10%, SCA3 for 42%, and SCA6 
      for 22% of German ataxia families. Seven of 27 SCA6 patients had no family 
      history of ataxia. Age at onset correlated inversely with repeat length in all 
      subtypes. Yet the average effect of one CAG unit on onset age was different for 
      each SCA subtype. We compared clinical, electrophysiological, and magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) findings to identify phenotypic characteristics of 
      genetically defined SCA subtypes. Slow saccades, hyporeflexia, myoclonus, and 
      action tremor proposed SCA2. SCA3 patients frequently developed diplopia, severe 
      spasticity or pronounced peripheral neuropathy, and impaired temperature 
      discrimination, apart from ataxia. SCA6 presented with a predominantly cerebellar 
      syndrome and patients often had onset after 55 years of age. SCA1 was 
      characterized by markedly prolonged peripheral and central motor conduction times 
      in motor evoked potentials. MRI scans showed pontine and cerebellar atrophy in 
      SCA1 and SCA2. In SCA3, enlargement of the fourth ventricle was the main sequel 
      of atrophy. SCA6 presented with pure cerebellar atrophy on MRI. However, overlap 
      between the four SCA subtypes was broad.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6: CAG repeat expansion in alpha1A voltage-dependent 
      calcium channel gene and clinical variations in Japanese population.
PG  - 879-84
AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are clinically and genetically 
      a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, mild CAG repeat 
      expansion in the alpha1A voltage-dependent calcium channel gene has been found to 
      be associated with a type of autosomal dominant SCA (SCA6). We analyzed 98 
      Japanese families with autosomal dominant SCAs, for whom CAG repeat expansions of 
      the SCA1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy genes were excluded, and 5 apparently sporadic cases of cortical 
      cerebellar atrophy. The diagnosis of SCA6 was confirmed in 30 families (31%) 
      comprising 47 affected individuals and 1 sporadic case. The size of expanded CAG 
      repeats ranged from 21 to 26 repeat units and was found to be correlated 
      inversely with age at onset. We identified 2 SCA6 patients homozygous for 
      expanded CAG repeats, whose ages at onset were earlier than the 95% lower 
      confidence level, suggesting the presence of a gene dosage effect of expanded CAG 
      repeat. Ataxia is the most common initial symptom found in 45 of the 48 patients. 
      Patients with a prolonged disease course showed other accompanying clinical 
      features including dystonic postures, involuntary movements, and abnormalities in

PG  - 1163-6
AB  - We describe patients from five generations of a pedigree with mutations in the 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 gene (SCA2). The predominant clinical features 
      observed included both appendicular and truncal ataxia, dysarthria, slowness of 
      saccades, and impaired optokinetic responses. Successive generations demonstrated 
      both earlier ages of onset as well as increasing numbers of trinucleotide repeat 
      sequences. The signs found in this family are compared with the description of 
      other families with SCA2 as well as with other types of dominantly inherited 
      spinocerebellar ataxias.

TI  - The expansion of the CAG repeat in ataxin-2 is a frequent cause of autosomal 
      dominant spinocerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 1009-13
AB  - The autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (ADSCAs) are a heterogeneous group 
      of late-onset neurodegenerative disorders with overlapping clinical features. 
      Genetic linkage studies have identified at least seven distinct loci for the 
      ADSCAs, allowing the genetic classification of these disorders. The 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) locus was mapped to chromosome 12, and a 
      gene responsible for this disorder was recently isolated. The mutation causing 
      SCA2 is an expansion of a trinucleotide CAG repeat contained within the coding 
      region of a novel gene. We describe the results of genotypic analysis for the 
      SCA2 repeat in individuals with ADSCA who were previously found negative for CAG 
      repeat expansions in the SCA1, SCA3, or SCA6 genes. The expanded CAG repeat has 
      been identified in 15 independent families. Repeat instability and anticipation 
      were observed in two large kindreds. The SCA2 mutation was found in 18% of our 
      ADSCA kindreds, confirming the high proportion of SCA2 among this group of 
      disorders.

TI  - SCA6 is caused by moderate CAG expansion in the alpha1A-voltage-dependent calcium 
      channel gene.
PG  - 1289-93
AB  - Recently, moderate (CAG)>20 repeat expansions in the alpha1A-voltage-dependent 
      calcium channel gene (CACNL1A4) have been identified in a previously unmapped 
      type of SCA which has been named SCA6. We investigated the (CAG)n repeat length 
      of the CACNL1A4 gene in 733 patients with sporadic ataxia and in 46 German 
      families with dominantly inherited SCA which do not harbor the SCA1, SCA2, or 
      MJD1/SCA3 mutation, respectively. The SCA6 (CAG)n expansion was identified in 32 
      patients most frequently with late manifestation of the disease. The (CAG)n 
      stretch of the affected allele varied between 22 and 28 trinucleotide units and 
      is therefore the shortest trinucleotide repeat expansion causing spinocerebellar 
      ataxia. The (CAG)n repeat length is inversely correlated with the age at onset. 
      In 11 parental transmissions of the expanded allele no repeat instability has 
      been observed. Repeat instability was also not found for the normal allele 
      investigating 431 meioses in the CEPH families. Analyzing 248 apparently healthy 
      octogenerians revealed one allele of 18 repeats which is the longest normal CAG 
      repeat in the CACNL1A4 gene reported. The SCA6 mutation causes the disease in 
      approximately 10% of autosomal dominant SCA in Germany. Most importantly, the 
      trinucleotide expansion was observed in four ataxia patients without obvious 
      family history of the disease which necessitates a search for the SCA6 (CAG)n 
      expansion even in sporadic patients.

TI  - Expanded CAG repeats in spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1) segregate with distinct 
      haplotypes in South african families.
PG  - 131-7
AB  - The autosomal dominant late onset spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are genetically 
      heterogeneous. Three genes, SCA1 on 6p, SCA2 on 12q and MJD1 on 14q, have been 
      isolated for SCA1, SCA2 and Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), respectively. In these 
      three autosomal dominant disorders the mutation is an expanded CAG repeat. 
      Evidence for heterogeneity in families not linked to the SCA1, SCA2 and MJD loci 
      is provided by the mapping of SCA loci to chromosomes 16q, 11cen and 3p. A total 
      of 14 South African kindreds and 22 sporadic individuals with SCA were 
      investigated for the expanded SCA1 and MJD repeats. None of the families nor the 
      sporadic individuals showed expansion of the MJD repeat. Expanded SCA1 and CAG 
      repeats were found to cosegregate with the disorder in six of the families tested 
      and were also observed in one sporadic individual with a negative family history 
      of SCA. The use of the microsatellite markers D6S260, D6S89 and D6S274 provided 
      evidence that the expanded SCA1 repeats segregated with three distinct haplotypes 
      in the six families. Use of the highly polymorphic tightly linked microsatellite 
      markers is still important as this stage, particularly where this coincides with 
      the possibility of a homozygous genotype with the trinucleotide repeat marker. 
      Importantly, our molecular findings indicate: (1) an absence of MJD expanded 
      repeats underlying SCA; (2) the major disease in this group is due to mutations 
      in the SCA1 gene; and (3) the familial disorder in the majority population group 
      (i.e. mixed ancestry) in the Western Cape region of South Africa is most likely 
      to be the result of two distinct founder events.

TI  - SCA2 trinucleotide expansion in German SCA patients.
PG  - 59-64
AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a group of clinically and 
      genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders which lead to progressive 
      cerebellar ataxia. A gene responsible for SCA type 2 has been mapped to human 
      chromosome 12 and the disease causing mutation has been identified as an unstable 
      and expanded (CAG)n trinucleotide repeat. We investigated the (CAG)n repeat 
      length of the SCA2 gene in 842 patients with sporadic ataxia and in 96 German 
      families with dominantly inherited SCA which do not harbor the SCA1 or MJD1/SCA3 
      mutation, respectively. The SCA2 (CAG)n expansion was identified in 71 patients 
      from 54 families. The (CAG)n stretch of the affected allele varied between 36 and 
      64 trinucleotide units. Significant repeat expansions occurred most commonly 
      during paternal transmission. Analysis of the (CAG)n repeat lengths with the age 
      of onset in 41 patients revealed an inverse correlation. Two hundred and 
      forty-one apparently healthy octogenerians carried alleles between 16 and 31 
      repeats. One 50-year old, healthy individual had 34 repeats; she had transmitted 
      an expanded allele to her child. The small difference between 'normal' and 
      disease alleles makes it necessary to define the extreme values of their ranges. 
      With one exception, the trinucleotide expansion was not observed in 842 ataxia 
      patients without a family history of the disease. The SCA2 mutation causes the 
      disease in nearly 14% of autosomal dominant SCA in Germany.

TI  - The prevalence and wide clinical spectrum of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      trinucleotide repeat in patients with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 842-50
AB  - The dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) represent a clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of disorders linked by progressive deterioration in balance 
      and coordination. The utility of genetic classification of the ADCAs has been 
      highlighted by the striking variability in clinical phenotype observed within 
      families and the overlap in clinical phenotype observed between those with 
      different genotypes. The recent demonstration that spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 
      (SCA2) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion within the ataxin-2 gene has allowed 
      us to determine the frequency of SCA2 compared with SCA1, SCA3/Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD), and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) in patients with 
      sporadic and inherited ataxia. SCA2 accounts for 13% of patients with ADCA 
      (without retinal degeneration), intermediate between SCA1 and SCA3/MJD, which 
      account for 6% and 23%, respectively. Together, SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3/MJD 
      constitute >40% of the mutations leading to ADCA I in our population. No patient 
      without a family history of ataxia, or with a pure cerebellar or spastic 
      syndrome, tested positive for SCA1, SCA2, or SCA3. No overlap in ataxin-2 allele 
      size between normal and disease chromosomes, or intermediate-sized alleles, were 
      observed. Repeat length correlated inversely with age at onset, accounting for 
      approximately 80% of the variability in onset age. Haplotype analysis provided no 
      evidence for a single founder chromosome, and diverse ethnic origins were 
      observed among SCA2 kindreds. In addition, a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes 
      was observed among SCA2 patients, including typical mild dominant ataxia, the MJD 
      phenotype with facial fasciculations and lid retraction, and early-onset ataxia 
      with a rapid course, chorea, and dementia.

TI  - Instability of highly expanded CAG repeats in mice transgenic for the 
      Huntington's disease mutation.
PG  - 197-200
AB  - Six inherited neurodegenerative diseases are caused by a CAG/polyglutamine 
      expansion, including spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), Huntington's 
      disease (HD), spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), dentatorubral pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA) Machado-Joseph disease (MJD or SCA3) and SCA2. Normal and 
      expanded HD allele sizes of 6-39 and 35-121 repeats have been reported, and the 
      allele distributions for the other diseases are comparable. Intergenerational 
      instability has been described in all cases, and repeats tend to be more unstable 
      on paternal transmission. This may present as larger increases on paternal 
      inheritance as in HD, or as a tendency to increase on male and decrease on female 
      transmission as in SCA1 (ref. 15). Somatic repeat instability is also apparent 
      and appears most pronounced in the CNS. The major exception is the cerebellum, 
      which in HD, DRPLA, SCA1 and MJD has a smaller repeat relative to the other brain 
      regions tested. Of non-CNS tissues, instability was observed in blood, liver, 
      kidney and colon. A mouse model of CAG repeat instability would be helpful in 
      unravelling its molecular basis although an absence of CAG repeat instability in 
      transgenic mice has so far been reported. These studies include (CAG) in the 
      androgen receptor cDNA, (CAG) in the HD cDNA, (CAG) in the SCA1 cDNA, (CAG) in 
      the SCA3 cDNA and as an isolated (CAG) tract.

TI  - Estimated contribution of known ataxia genes in ataxia patients undergoing DNA 
      testing.
PG  - 275-8
AB  - We estimated the relative contributions of known ataxia genes (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 
      and X25) in the patient population sent to our DNA diagnostic laboratory for 
      diagnostic testing. Approximately 28% of these patients had an abnormal triplet 
      repeat expansion in one of these ataxia genes (3% for SCA1, 8% for SCA2, 11% for 
      SCA3/MJD, 2% for SCA6, 3% for SCA7, and 1.5% for X25). The lack of abnormal 
      repeat expansions in the majority of ataxis patients tested suggests that the 
      molecular defects associated with most ataxia cases are currently undetermined 
      and that this population includes both familial and sporadic cases. In contrast, 
      of the patients submitted for genetic testing for Friedrich's ataxia (FRDA), 44% 
      (69/157) showed at least one expansion in the X25 gene, indicating that FRDA 
      accounts for a significant proportion of the recessively inherited ataxias and 
      appears to have a high rate of accurate clinical diagnosis. On the basis of our 
      DNA studies, we propose a comprehensive and efficient approach for molecular 
      analysis of ataxia patients.

TI  - Screening for proteins with polyglutamine expansions in autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxias.
PG  - 1887-92
AB  - Expansion of trinucleotide CAG repeats coding for polyglutamine has been 
      implicated in five neurodegenerative disorders, including spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) 1 and SCA3 or Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), two forms of type I 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA). Using the 1C2 antibody which 
      specifically recognizes large polyglutamine tracts, particularly those that are 
      expanded, we recently reported the detection of proteins with pathological 
      glutamine expansions in lymphoblasts from another form of ADCA type I, SCA2, as 
      well as from patients presenting with the distinct phenotype of ADCA type II. We 
      now have screened a large series of patients with ADCA or isolated cases with 
      cerebellar ataxia, for the presence of proteins with polyglutamine expansions. A 
      150 kDa SCA2 protein was detected in 16 out of 40 families with ADCA type I. This 
      corresponds to 24% of all ADCA type I families, which is much more frequent than 
      SCA1 in this series of patients (13%). The signal intensity of the SCA2 protein 
      was negatively correlated to age at onset, as expected for an expanded and 
      unstable trinucleotide repeat mutation. The disease segregated with markers 
      closely linked to the SCA2 locus in all identified SCA2 families. In addition, a 
      specific 130 kDa protein, which segregated with the disease, was detected in 
      lymphoblasts of patients from nine families with ADCA type II. It was also 
      visualized in the cerebral cortex of one of the patients, demonstrating its 
      translation in the nervous system. Finally, no new disease-related proteins 
      containing expanded polyglutamine tracts could be detected in lymphoblasts from 
      the remaining patients with ADCA or isolated cases with cerebellar ataxia.

TI  - Cloning of the gene for spinocerebellar ataxia 2 reveals a locus with high 
      sensitivity to expanded CAG/glutamine repeats.
PG  - 285-91
AB  - Two forms of the neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia are known to 
      be caused by the expansion of a CAG (polyglutamine) trinucleotide repeat. By 
      screening cDNA expression libraries, using an antibody specific for polyglutamine 
      repeats, we identified six novel genes containing CAG stretches. One of them is 
      mutated in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia linked to chromosome 12q (SCA2). 
      This gene shows ubiquitous expression and encodes a protein of unknown function. 
      Normal SCA2 alleles (17 to 29 CAG repeats) contain one to three CAAs in the 
      repeat. Mutated alleles (37 to 50 repeats) appear particularly unstable, upon 
      both paternal and maternal transmissions. The sequence of three of them revealed 
      pure CAG stretches. The steep inverse correlation between age of onset and CAG 
      number suggests a higher sensitivity to polyglutamine length than in the other 
      polyglutamine expansion diseases.

TI  - Identification of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 gene using a direct 
      identification of repeat expansion and cloning technique, DIRECT.
PG  - 277-84
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative 
      disorder that affects the cerebellum and other areas of the central nervous 
      system. We have devised a novel strategy, the direct identification of repeat 
      expansion and cloning technique (DIRECT), which allows selective detection of 
      expanded CAG repeats and cloning of the genes involved. By applying DIRECT, we 
      identified an expanded CAG repeat of the gene for SCA2. CAG repeats of normal 
      alleles range in size from 15 to 24 repeat units, while those of SCA2 chromosomes 
      are expanded to 35 to 59 repeat units. The SCA2 cDNA is predicted to code for 
      1,313 amino acids-with the CAG repeats coding for a polyglutamine tract. DIRECT 
      is a robust strategy for identification of pathologically expanded trinucleotide 
      repeats and will dramatically accelerate the search for causative genes of 
      neuropsychiatric diseases caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions.

TI  - Moderate expansion of a normally biallelic trinucleotide repeat in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2.
PG  - 269-76
AB  - The gene for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) has been mapped to 12q24.1. A 
      1.1-megabase contig in the candidate region was assembled in P1 artificial 
      chromosome and bacterial artificial chromosome clones. Using this contig, we 
      identified a CAG trinucleotide repeat with CAA interruptions that was expanded in 
      patients with SCA2. In contrast to other unstable trinucleotide repeats, this CAG 
      repeat was not highly polymorphic in normal individuals. In SCA2 patients, the 
      repeat was perfect and expanded to 36-52 repeats. The most common disease allele 
      contained (CAG)37, one of the shortest expansions seen in a CAG expansion 
      syndrome. The repeat occurs in the 5'-coding region of SCA2 which is a member of 
      a novel gene family.

TI  - Frequency of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy, 
      and Machado-Joseph disease mutations in a large group of spinocerebellar ataxia 
      patients.
PG  - 214-8
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders varying in both clinical manifestations and mode of inheritance. Six 
      different genes causing autosomal dominant SCA are mapped: SCA1, SCA2, 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA4, SCA5, and dentatorubropallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA). Expansions of an unstable trinucleotide CAG repeat cause three 
      of these disorders: SCA type 1 (SCA1), MJD, and DRPLA. We determine the frequency 
      of the SCA1, DRPLA, and MJD mutations in a large group of unrelated SCA patients 
      with various patterns of inheritance and different ethnic backgrounds. We studied 
      92 unrelated SCA patients. The frequency of the SCA1 mutation was 3% in the 
      overall patient group and 10% in the non-Portuguese dominantly inherited SCA 
      subgroup. We found that DRPLA mutation in only one Japanese patient, who was 
      previously diagnosed with this disease. We identified the MJD mutation in 41% of 
      the overall patient group, which included 38 autosomal dominant kindreds of 
      Portuguese origin; the frequency of the MJD mutation among the non-Portuguese 
      dominantly inherited cases was 17%. These results suggest that SCA may be 
      occasionally caused by the SCA1 mutation and rarely caused by the DRPLA mutation 
      and that, to date, the MJD mutation seems to be the most common cause of 
      dominantly inherited SCA. Finally, our results suggest that recessively inherited 
      cases of SCA are not caused by the known trinucleotide repeat expansions.

TI  - Polyglutamine expansion as a pathological epitope in Huntington's disease and 
      four dominant cerebellar ataxias.
PG  - 403-6
AB  - A polyglutamine expansion (encoded by a CAG repeat) in specific proteins causes 
      neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (HD) and four other disorders, by an 
      unknown mechanism thought to involve gain of function or toxicity of the mutated 
      protein. The pathological threshold is 37-40 glutamines in three of these 
      diseases, whereas the corresponding normal proteins contain polymorphic repeats 
      of up to about 35 glutamines. The age of onset of clinical manifestations is 
      inversely correlated to the length of the polyglutamine expansion. Here we report 
      the characterization of a monoclonal antibody that selectively recognizes 
      polyglutamine expansion in the proteins implicated in HD and in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) 1 and 3. The intensity of signal depends on the length of the 
      polyglutamine expansion, and the antibody also detects specific pathological 
      proteins expected to contain such expansion, in SCA2 and in autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia with retinal degeneration, whose genes have not yet been 
      identified.

TI  - Familial periodic cerebellar ataxia without myokymia maps to a 19-cM region on 
      19p13.
PG  - 1443-9
AB  - Familial periodic cerebellar ataxia (FPCA) is a heterogeneous group of rare 
      autosomal dominant disorders characterized by episodic cerebellar disturbance. A 
      potassium-channel gene (KCNA1) has been found to be responsible for one of its 
      subgroups, familial periodic cerebellar ataxia with myokymia (FPCA/+M; MIM 
      160120). A different subgroup that is not associated with myokymia (FPCA/-M; MIM 
      108500) was recently mapped to chromosome 19p. Here we have performed linkage 
      analysis in two large families with FPCA/-M that also demonstrated 
      neurodegenerative pathology of the cerebellum. Three markers in 19p13 gave 
      significant lod scores (> 3.0), while linkage to KCNA1 and three known loci for 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3) was excluded. The highest lod score 
      was obtained with the marker D19S413 (4.4 at recombination fraction 0), and 
      identification of meiotic recombinants in affected individuals placed the locus 
      between the flanking markers D19S406 and D19S226, narrowing the interval to 19 
      cM. A CAG trinucleotide-repeat expansion was detected in one family but did not 
      cosegregate with the disease.
