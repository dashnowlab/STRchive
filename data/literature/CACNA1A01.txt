AB  - OBJECTIVE: Late-onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA) is a slowly progressive cerebellar 
      disorder with symptom onset >/=30years of age. Intronic tandem repeat expansions 
      (TREs) in RFC1 and FGF14 have recently emerged as common causes of LOCA. The 
      relative contribution of classic vs. newly discovered TREs has not been 
      systematically investigated in LOCA cohorts. METHODS: Over 28 years, 206 
      consecutive Greek LOCA index patients were referred for genetic testing and, 
      based on clinical data and inheritance pattern, screened for FRDA, SCA1,2,3,6,7, 
      FXTAS, CANVAS and SCA27B. RESULTS: A genetic diagnosis was reached in 62 of 206 
      cases (30.1 %). Mean age was 60.1 +/- 11.2 (35-87) years and mean age at onset 
      (AAO) 52.5 +/- 11.4 (30-80) years. SCA27B accounted for 9.7 % of LOCA cases, CANVAS 
      for 7.8 % and FRDA for 4.4 %. The overall frequency of SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 was 
      6.8 %. No cases of SCA3 and SCA6 were identified. FXTAS contributed 1.5 % of 
      cases. In sporadic cases, the diagnostic yield was 22.8 % (34 of 149; SCA27B: 
      8.7 %, CANVAS: 8.1 %, FRDA: 2.7 %, SCA2: 1.3 %, FXTAS: 1.3 % and SCA7: 0.7 %). In 
      familial cases, the diagnostic yield was 49.1 % (28 of 57). Two cases with CANVAS 
      had pseudodominant inheritance. Patients with SCA27B, CANVAS and FXTAS had mean 
      AAO > 50 years, whereas patients with FRDA, SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 had mean 
      AAO < 50 years. CONCLUSION: Recently-discovered TREs causing SCA27B and CANVAS 
      represent the commonest known genetic causes of LOCA. Prioritizing testing for 
      FGF14 and RFC1 expansions in the diagnostic algorithm of LOCA is recommended.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive, 
      adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by combinations 
      of autonomic failure, parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia and pyramidal signs. 
      Although a few genetic factors have been reported to contribute to the disease, 
      its mutational profiles have not been systemically studied. METHODS: To address 
      the genetic profiles of clinically diagnosed MSA patients, exome sequencing and 
      triplet repeat detection was conducted in 205 MSA patients, including one 
      familial case. The pathogenicity of variants was determined according to the 
      American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for 
      Molecular Pathology guidelines. RESULTS: In the familial patient, a novel 
      heterozygous COQ2 pathogenic variant (p.Ala351Thr) was identified in the MSA 
      pedigree. In the sporadic patients, 29 pathogenic variants were revealed in 21 
      genes, and the PARK7 p.Ala104Thr variant was significantly associated with MSA 
      (p = 0.0018). Moreover, burden tests demonstrated that the pathogenic variants 
      were enriched in cerebellar ataxia-related genes in patients. Furthermore, repeat 
      expansion analyses revealed that two patients carried the pathogenic CAG repeat 
      expansion in the CACNA1A gene (SCA6), one patient carried the 
      (ACAGG)exp/(ACAGG)exp expansion in RFC1 and one carried the GAA-pure expansion in 
      FGF14 gene. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, a novel COQ2 pathogenic variant was 
      identified in a familial MSA patient, and repeat expansions in CACNA1A, RFC1 and 
      FGF14 gene were detected in four sporadic patients. Moreover, a PARK7 variant and 
      the burden of pathogenic variants in cerebellar ataxia-related genes were 
      associated with MSA.

TI  - Spinocerebellar Ataxias: Phenotypic Spectrum of PolyQ versus Non-Repeat Expansion 
      Forms.
PG  - 2258-2268
LID - 10.1007/s12311-024-01723-9 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are most frequently due to (CAG)(n) (coding for 
      polyglutamine, polyQ) expansions and, less so, to expansion of other 
      oligonucleotide repeats (non-polyQ) or other type of variants (non-repeat 
      expansion SCA). In this study we compared polyQ and non-repeat expansion SCA, in 
      a cohort of patients with hereditary ataxia followed at a tertiary hospital. From 
      a prospective study, 88 patients (51 families) with SCA were selected, 74 (40 
      families) of whom genetically diagnosed. Thirty-eight patients (51.4%, 19 
      families) were confirmed as having a polyQ (no other repeat-expansions were 
      identified) and 36 (48.6%, 21 families) a non-repeat expansion SCA. Median 
      age-at-onset was 39.5 [30.0-45.5] for polyQ and 7.0 years [1.00-21.50] for 
      non-repeat expansion SCA. PolyQ SCA were associated with cerebellar onset, and 
      non-repeat expansion forms with non-cerebellar onset. Time to diagnosis was 
      longer for non-repeat expansion SCA. The most common polyQ SCA were 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD/SCA3) (73.7%) and SCA2 (15.8%); whereas in non-repeat 
      expansion SCA ATX-CACNA1A (14.3%), ATP1A3-related ataxia, ATX-ITPR1, 
      ATX/HSP-KCNA2, and ATX-PRKCG (9.5% each) predominated. Disease duration (up to 
      inclusion) was significantly higher in non-repeat expansion SCA, but the 
      difference in SARA score was not statistically significant. Cerebellar peduncles 
      and pons atrophy were more common in polyQ ataxias, as was axonal neuropathy. SCA 
      had a wide range of genetic etiology, age-at-onset and presentation. Proportion 
      of polyQ and non-repeat expansion SCA was similar; the latter had a higher 
      genetic heterogeneity. While polyQ ataxias were typically linked to cerebellar 
      onset in adulthood, non-repeat expansion forms associated with early onset and 
      non-cerebellar presentations.

AB  - There is an obvious clinical-pathological overlap between essential tremor and 
      some known tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansion disorders. The aim is 
      to analyse whether these short tandem repeat genes, including ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, TBP, BEAN1, NOP56, DAB1, ATN1, 
      SADM12 and FMR1, are associated with familial essential tremor patients. Genetic 
      analysis of repeat sizes in tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansions was 
      performed in a large cohort of 515 familial essential tremor probands and 300 
      controls. The demographic and clinical features among carriers of pathogenic 
      expansions, intermediate repeats and non-carriers were compared. A total of 18 
      out of 515 (18/515, 3.7%) patients were found to have repeats expansions, 
      including 12 cases (12/515, 2.5%) with intermediate repeat expansions (one ATXN1, 
      eight TBP, two FMR1, one ATN1), and six cases (6/515, 1.2%) with pathogenic 
      expansions (one ATXN1, one ATXN2, one ATXN8OS, one PPP2R2B, one FMR1, one 
      SAMD12). There were no statistically significant differences in intermediate 
      repeats compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, there were no significant 
      differences in demographics and clinical features among individuals with 
      pathogenic expansions, intermediate repeat expansions carriers and non-carriers. 
      Our study indicates that the intermediate repeat expansion in tremor-associated 
      short tandem repeat expansions does not pose an increased risk for essential 
      tremor, and rare pathogenic expansion carriers have been found in the familial 
      essential tremor cohort. The diagnosis of essential tremor based solely on 
      clinical symptoms remains a challenge in distinguishing it from known short 
      tandem repeat expansions diseases with overlapping clinical-pathological 
      features.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) is a neurological disease characterized by 
      action tremor in upper arms. Although its high heritability and prevalence 
      worldwide, its etiology and association with other diseases are still unknown. 
      METHOD: We investigated 10 common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), including SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, SCA36, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA) in 92 early-onset familial ET pedigrees in China collected from 
      2016 to 2022. RESULT: We found one SCA12 proband carried 51 CAG repeats within 
      PPP2R2B gene and one SCA3 proband with intermediate CAG repeats (55) with ATXN3 
      gene. The other 90 ET probands all had normal repeat expansions. CONCLUSION: 
      Tremor can be the initial phenotype of certain SCA. For early-onset, familial ET 
      patients, careful physical examinations are needed before genetic SCA screening.

AB  - The Cerebellar Cognitive Affective/Schmahmann Syndrome (CCAS) manifests as 
      impaired executive control, linguistic processing, visual spatial function, and 
      affect regulation. The CCAS has been described in the spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs), but its prevalence is unknown. We analyzed results of the CCAS/Schmahmann 
      Scale (CCAS-S), developed to detect and quantify CCAS, in two natural history 
      studies of 309 individuals Symptomatic for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, or SCA8, 
      26 individuals Pre-symptomatic for SCA1 or SCA3, and 37 Controls. We compared 
      total raw scores, domain scores, and total fail scores between Symptomatic, 
      Pre-symptomatic, and Control cohorts, and between SCA types. We calculated scale 
      sensitivity and selectivity based on CCAS category designation among Symptomatic 
      individuals and Controls, and correlated CCAS-S performance against age and 
      education, and in Symptomatic patients, against genetic repeat length, onset age, 
      disease duration, motor ataxia, depression, and fatigue. Definite CCAS was 
      identified in 46% of the Symptomatic group. False positive rate among Controls 
      was 5.4%. Symptomatic individuals had poorer global CCAS-S performance than 
      Controls, accounting for age and education. The domains of semantic fluency, 
      phonemic fluency, and category switching that tap executive function and 
      linguistic processing consistently separated Symptomatic individuals from 
      Controls. CCAS-S scores correlated most closely with motor ataxia. Controls were 
      similar to Pre-symptomatic individuals whose nearness to symptom onset was 
      unknown. The use of the CCAS-S identifies a high CCAS prevalence in a large 
      cohort of SCA patients, underscoring the utility of the scale and the notion that 
      the CCAS is the third cornerstone of clinical ataxiology.

AB  - Neurologists have a difficult time identifying sporadic cerebellar ataxia. 
      Multiple system atrophy of the cerebellar type (MSA-C), spontaneous late cortical 
      cerebellar atrophy, and prolonged alcohol use are a few possible causes. In a 
      group of people with sporadic cerebellar ataxia that was not MSA-C, an 
      autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) mutation was recently discovered. 
      Chinese single-hospital cohort will be used in this study to genetic screen for 
      SCA-related genes. One hundred forty individuals with CA were monitored over 8 
      years. Thirty-one individuals had familial CA, 109 patients had sporadic CA, 73 
      had MSA-C, and 36 had non-MSA-C sporadic CA. In 28 of the 31 non-MSA-C sporadic 
      patients who requested the test, we carried out gene analysis, including SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, SCA31, and 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The control group consisted of 
      family members of the patients. In 57% of the instances with spontaneous CA that 
      were not MSA-C, gene abnormalities were discovered. The most frequent exception 
      among individuals with sporadic CA was SCA6 (36%), followed by monsters in SCA1, 
      2, 3, 8, and DRPLA. In contrast, 75% of the patients with familial CA had gene 
      abnormalities, the most frequent of which was SCA6 abnormality. The age of 69 vs 
      59 was higher, and the CAG repeat length was a minor age of 23 vs 25 in the 
      former instances compared to the last one among individuals with SCA6 anomalies 
      that were sporadic as opposed to familial cases. In sporadic CA, 
      autosomal-dominant mutations in SCA genes, notably in SCA6, are common. Although 
      the cause of the increased incidence of SCA6 mutations is unknown, it may be 
      related to a greater age of onset and varied penetrance of SCA6 mutations.

TI  - Prevalence of repeat expansions causing autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      ataxias in Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan.

AB  - In Japan, approximately 30% of spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) is hereditary, 
      and more than 90% of hereditary SCD is autosomal dominant SCD (AD-SCD). We have 
      previously reported the types of AD-SCD in Hokkaido, twice. In this study, we 
      investigated the status of AD-SCD mainly due to repeat expansions, covering the 
      period since the last report. We performed genetic analysis for 312 patients with 
      a clinical diagnosis of SCD, except for multiple system atrophy at medical 
      institutions in Hokkaido between January 2007 and December 2020. The median age 
      at the time of analysis was 58 (1-86) years. Pathogenic variants causing AD-SCD 
      due to repeat expansion were found in 61.5% (192 cases). Spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) 6 was the most common type in 25.3% (79 cases), followed by Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD)/SCA3 in 13.8% (43), SCA1 in 6.4% (20), SCA2 in 5.1% (16), SCA31 in 
      4.8% (15), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy in 4.8% (15), SCA7 in 0.6% (2), 
      and SCA8 in 0.6% (2). SCA17, 27B, 36, and 37 were not found. Compared to previous 
      reports, this study found a higher prevalence of SCA6 and a lower prevalence of 
      MJD/SCA3. An increasing number of cases identified by genetic testing, including 
      cases with no apparent family history, accurately revealed the distribution of 
      disease types in Hokkaido.

AB  - Tandem repeats (TRs) are one of the largest sources of polymorphism, and their 
      length is associated with gene regulation. Although previous studies reported 
      several tandem repeats regulating gene splicing in cis (spl-TRs), no large-scale 
      study has been conducted. In this study, we established a genome-wide catalog of 
      9537 spl-TRs with a total of 58,290 significant TR-splicing associations across 
      49 tissues (false discovery rate 5%) by using Genotype-Tissue expression (GTex) 
      Project data. Regression models explaining splicing variation by using spl-TRs 
      and other flanking variants suggest that at least some of the spl-TRs directly 
      modulate splicing. In our catalog, two spl-TRs are known loci for repeat 
      expansion diseases, spinocerebellar ataxia 6 (SCA6) and 12 (SCA12). Splicing 
      alterations by these spl-TRs were compatible with those observed in SCA6 and 
      SCA12. Thus, our comprehensive spl-TR catalog may help elucidate the 
      pathomechanism of genetic diseases.

AB  - Although the best-known spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are triplet repeat 
      diseases, many SCAs are not caused by repeat expansions. The rarity of individual 
      non-expansion SCAs, however, has made it difficult to discern genotype-phenotype 
      correlations. We therefore screened individuals who had been found to bear 
      variants in a non-expansion SCA-associated gene through genetic testing, and 
      after we eliminated genetic groups that had fewer than 30 subjects, there were 
      756 subjects bearing single-nucleotide variants or deletions in one of seven 
      genes: CACNA1A (239 subjects), PRKCG (175), AFG3L2 (101), ITPR1 (91), STUB1 (77), 
      SPTBN2 (39), or KCNC3 (34). We compared age at onset, disease features, and 
      progression by gene and variant. There were no features that reliably 
      distinguished one of these SCAs from another, and several genes-CACNA1A, ITPR1, 
      SPTBN2, and KCNC3-were associated with both adult-onset and infantile-onset forms 
      of disease, which also differed in presentation. Nevertheless, progression was 
      overall very slow, and STUB1-associated disease was the fastest. Several variants 
      in CACNA1A showed particularly wide ranges in age at onset: one variant produced 
      anything from infantile developmental delay to ataxia onset at 64 years of age 
      within the same family. For CACNA1A, ITPR1, and SPTBN2, the type of variant and 
      charge change on the protein greatly affected the phenotype, defying 
      pathogenicity prediction algorithms. Even with next-generation sequencing, 
      accurate diagnosis requires dialogue between the clinician and the geneticist.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxias (CAs) represent a group of autosomal dominant and recessive 
      neurodegenerative disorders affecting cerebellum with or without spinal cord. 
      Overall, CAs have preponderance for tandem nucleotide repeat expansions as an 
      etiological factor (10 TREs explain nearly 30-40% of ataxia cohort globally). The 
      experience of 10 years of common genetic ataxia subtypes for  approximately 5600 patients' 
      referrals (Pan-India) received at a single center is shared herein. Frequencies 
      (in %, n) of SCA types and FRDA in the sample cohort are observed as follows: 
      SCA12 (8.6%, 490); SCA2 (8.5%, 482); SCA1 (4.8%, 272); SCA3 (2%, 113); SCA7 
      (0.5%, 28); SCA6 (0.1%, 05); SCA17 (0.1%, 05), and FRDA (2.2%, 127). A 
      significant amount of variability in TRE lengths at each locus is observed, we 
      noted presence of biallelic expansion, co-occurrence of SCA-subtypes, and the 
      presence of premutable normal alleles. The frequency of mutated GAA-FRDA allele 
      in healthy controls is 1/158 (0.63%), thus an expected FRDA prevalence of 1:100 
      000 persons. The data of this study are relevant not only for clinical decision 
      making but also for guidance in direction of genetic investigations, 
      transancestral comparison of genotypes, and lastly provide insight for policy 
      decision for the consideration of SCAs under rare disease category.

TI  - Fast and reliable detection of repeat expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia using 
      exomes.
PG  - 717-721
LID - 10.1136/jmg-2022-108924 [doi]
AB  - Usually, molecular diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia is based on a step-by-step 
      approach with targeted sizing of four repeat expansions accounting for most 
      dominant cases, then targeted sequencing of other genes. Nowadays, genome 
      sequencing allows detection of most pathogenic variants in a single step. The 
      ExpansionHunter tool can detect expansions in short-read genome sequencing data. 
      Recent studies have shown that ExpansionHunter can also be used to identify 
      repeat expansions in exome sequencing data. We tested ExpansionHunter on 
      spinocerebellar ataxia exomes in a research context as a second-line analysis, 
      after exclusion of main CAG repeat expansions in half of the probands. First, we 
      confirmed the detection of expansions in seven known expansion carriers and then, 
      after targeted analysis of ATXN1, 2, 3 and 7, CACNA1A, TBP, ATN1, NOP56, AR and 
      HTT in 498 exomes, we found 22 additional pathogenic expansions. Comparison with 
      capillary migration sizing in 247 individuals and confirmation of all expanded 
      alleles detected by ExpansionHunter demonstrated that for these loci, sensitivity 
      and specificity reached 100%. ExpansionHunter detected but underestimated the 
      repeat size for larger expansions, and the normal alleles distribution at each 
      locus should be taken into account to detect expansions. Exome combined with 
      ExpansionHunter is reliable to detect repeat expansions in selected loci as 
      first-line analysis in spinocerebellar ataxia.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic efficacy of clinical 
      exome-targeted sequencing (CES) and spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36) screening 
      in a real-life cohort of patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) from Eastern Spain. 
      METHODS: A total of 130 unrelated patients with CA, negative for common 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, 
      SCA17, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA], and Friedreich ataxia), were 
      studied with CES. Bioinformatic and genotype-phenotype analyses were performed to 
      assess the pathogenicity of the variants encountered. Copy number variants were 
      analyzed when appropriate. In undiagnosed dominant and sporadic cases, repeat 
      primed PCR was used to screen for the presence of a repeat expansion in the NOP56 
      gene. RESULTS: CES identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 50 
      families (39%), including 23 novel variants. Overall, there was a high genetic 
      heterogeneity, and the most frequent genetic diagnosis was SPG7 (n = 15), 
      followed by SETX (n = 6), CACNA1A (n = 5), POLR3A (n = 4), and SYNE1 (n = 3). In 
      addition, 17 families displayed likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants in 14 
      different genes: KCND3 (n = 2), KIF1C (n = 2), CYP27A1A (n = 2), AFG3L2 (n = 1), 
      ANO10 (n = 1), CAPN1 (n = 1), CWF19L1 (n = 1), ITPR1 (n = 1), KCNA1 (n = 1), OPA1 
      (n = 1), PNPLA6 (n = 1), SPG11 (n = 1), SPTBN2 (n = 1), and TPP1 (n = 1). 
      Twenty-two novel variants were characterized. SCA36 was diagnosed in 11 families, 
      all with autosomal dominant (AD) presentation. SCA36 screening increased the 
      total diagnostic rate to 47% (n = 61/130). Ultimately, undiagnosed patients 
      showed delayed age at onset (p < 0.05) and were more frequently sporadic. 
      DISCUSSION: Our study provides insight into the genetic landscape of CA in 
      Eastern Spain. Although CES was an effective approach to capture genetic 
      heterogeneity, most patients remained undiagnosed. SCA36 was found to be a 
      relatively frequent form and, therefore, should be tested prior to CES in 
      familial AD presentations in particular geographical regions.

TI  - The S-Factor, a New Measure of Disease Severity in Spinocerebellar Ataxia: 
      Findings and Implications.
PG  - 790-809
LID - 10.1007/s12311-022-01424-1 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are progressive neurodegenerative disorders, but 
      there is no metric that predicts disease severity over time. We hypothesized that 
      by developing a new metric, the Severity Factor (S-Factor) using immutable 
      disease parameters, it would be possible to capture disease severity independent 
      of clinical rating scales. Extracting data from the CRC-SCA and READISCA natural 
      history studies, we calculated the S-Factor for 438 participants with symptomatic 
      SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6, as follows: ((length of CAG repeat expansion - maximum 
      normal repeat length) /maximum normal repeat length) x (current age - age at 
      disease onset) x 10). Within each SCA type, the S-Factor at the first Scale for 
      the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) visit (baseline) was correlated 
      against scores on SARA and other motor and cognitive assessments. In 281 
      participants with longitudinal data, the slope of the S-Factor over time was 
      correlated against slopes of scores on SARA and other motor rating scales. At 
      baseline, the S-Factor showed moderate-to-strong correlations with SARA and other 
      motor rating scales at the group level, but not with cognitive performance. 
      Longitudinally the S-Factor slope showed no consistent association with the slope 
      of performance on motor scales. Approximately 30% of SARA slopes reflected a 
      trend of non-progression in motor symptoms. The S-Factor is an 
      observer-independent metric of disease burden in SCAs. It may be useful at the 
      group level to compare cohorts at baseline in clinical studies. Derivation and 
      examination of the S-factor highlighted challenges in the use of clinical rating 
      scales in this population.

TI  - Evolution of disability in spinocerebellar ataxias type 1, 2, 3, and 6.
PG  - 286-295
LID - 10.1002/acn3.51515 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the evolution of disability in spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCAs) type 1, 2, 3, and 6 (SCA1, 2, 3, 6). METHODS: We analyzed data of 
      two longitudinal cohorts (RISCA, EUROSCA) which recruited ataxic and non-ataxic 
      SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6 mutation carriers. To study disability, we used a 
      five-stage system for ataxia defined by walking ability (stages 0-3) and death 
      (stage 4). Transitions were analyzed using a multi-state model with proportional 
      transition hazards. Based on the hazard estimates, transition probabilities and 
      the expected lengths of stay in each stage were calculated. We further studied 
      the effect of sex and CAG repeat length on progression. RESULTS: Data of 3138 
      visits in 677 participants were analyzed. Median SARA scores for SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, and SCA6 ranged from 1.5 (interquartile range [IQR] = 0.0-3.5) to 3.5 
      (IQR = 1.4-6.1) in stage 0, 11.5 (IQR = 9.6-14.0) to 13.8 (IQR = 11.0-16.0) in 
      stage 1, 19.0 (IQR = 17.0-21.0) to 23.8 (IQR = 19.5-27.0) in stage 2, and 28.5 
      (IQR = 26.0-32.5) to 34.0 (IQR = 32.6-37.1) in stage 3. Modeling allowed to 
      calculate the subtype-specific probability to be in a certain stage at a given 
      age and duration of each stage. CAG repeat length was associated with faster 
      progression in SCA1 (HR, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.1-1.2), SCA2 (1.2, 1.1-1.3), and SCA3 
      (1.1, 1.0-1.2). In SCA6, female sex was associated with faster progression (1.7, 
      1.1-2.6). INTERPRETATION: Our data are important for counselling of patients, 
      assessment of the relevance of outcome markers, and design of clinical trials.

      disorders in the UK: a retrospective diagnostic accuracy and prospective clinical

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansion disorders affect about 1 in 3000 individuals and are 
      clinically heterogeneous diseases caused by expansions of short tandem DNA 
      repeats. Genetic testing is often locus-specific, resulting in underdiagnosis of 
      people who have atypical clinical presentations, especially in paediatric 
      patients without a previous positive family history. Whole genome sequencing is 
      increasingly used as a first-line test for other rare genetic disorders, and we 
      aimed to assess its performance in the diagnosis of patients with neurological 
      repeat expansion disorders. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic 
      accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect the most common repeat expansion 
      loci associated with neurological outcomes (AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, 
      C9orf72, CACNA1A, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, and TBP) using samples obtained within 
      the National Health Service in England from patients who were suspected of having 
      neurological disorders; previous PCR test results were used as the reference 
      standard. The clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat 
      expansions was prospectively examined in previously genetically tested and 
      undiagnosed patients recruited in 2013-17 to the 100 000 Genomes Project in the 
      UK, who were suspected of having a genetic neurological disorder (familial or 
      early-onset forms of ataxia, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, dementia, motor 
      neuron disease, parkinsonian movement disorders, intellectual disability, or 
      neuromuscular disorders). If a repeat expansion call was made using whole genome 
      sequencing, PCR was used to confirm the result. FINDINGS: The diagnostic accuracy 
      of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat expansions was evaluated against 793 
      PCR tests previously performed within the NHS from 404 patients. Whole genome 
      sequencing correctly classified 215 of 221 expanded alleles and 1316 of 1321 
      non-expanded alleles, showing 97.3% sensitivity (95% CI 94.2-99.0) and 99.6% 
      specificity (99.1-99.9) across the 13 disease-associated loci when compared with 
      PCR test results. In samples from 11 631 patients in the 100 000 Genomes Project, 
      whole genome sequencing identified 81 repeat expansions, which were also tested 
      by PCR: 68 were confirmed as repeat expansions in the full pathogenic range, 11 
      were non-pathogenic intermediate expansions or premutations, and two were 
      non-expanded repeats (16% false discovery rate). INTERPRETATION: In our study, 
      whole genome sequencing for the detection of repeat expansions showed high 
      sensitivity and specificity, and it led to identification of neurological repeat 
      expansion disorders in previously undiagnosed patients. These findings support 
      implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical laboratories for diagnosis 
      of patients who have a neurological presentation consistent with a repeat 
      expansion disorder. FUNDING: Medical Research Council, Department of Health and

TI  - Genetic Distribution of Five Spinocerebellar Ataxia Microsatellite Loci in 
      Mexican Native American Populations and Its Impact on Contemporary Mestizo 
      Populations.

LID - 157
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) conform a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders with autosomal dominant inheritance. Five of the most frequent SCAs are 
      caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the exons of specific genes. The SCAs 
      incidence and the distribution of polymorphic CAG alleles vary among populations 
      and ethnicities. Thus, characterization of the genetic architecture of ethnically 
      diverse populations, which have undergone recent admixture and demographic 
      events, could facilitate the identification of genetic risk factors. Owing to the 
      great ethnic diversity of the Mexican population, this study aimed to analyze the 
      allele frequencies of five SCA microsatellite loci (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and 
      SCA7) in eleven Mexican Native American (MNA) populations. Data from the 
      literature were used to compare the allelic distribution of SCA loci with 
      worldwide populations. The SCA loci allelic frequencies evidenced a certain 
      genetic homogeneity in the MNA populations, except for Mayans, who exhibited 
      distinctive genetic profiles. Neither pathological nor large normal alleles were 
      found in MNA populations, except for the SCA2 pre-mutated allele in the Zapotec 
      population. Collectively, our findings demonstrated the contribution of the MNA 
      ancestry in shaping the genetic structure of contemporary Mexican Mestizo 
      populations. Our results also suggest that Native American ancestry has no impact 
      on the origin of SCAs in the Mexican population. Instead, the acquisition of 
      pathological SCA alleles could be associated with European migration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a progressive, autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder typically associated with CAG repeat expansions. 
      OBJECTIVE: We assessed the pathogenicity of the novel, heterozygous missense 
      variant p.Cys256Phe (C256F) in the pore-forming alpha1-subunit of the Cav2.1 Ca(2+) 
      channel found in a 63-year-old woman with SCA with no CAG repeat expansion. 
      METHODS: We examined the effect of the C256F variant on channel function using 
      whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in transfected tsA-201 cells. RESULTS: The 
      maximum Ca(2+) current density was significantly reduced in the mutant compared 
      to wild-type, which could not be explained by lower expression levels of mutant 
      Cav2.1 alpha1- protein. Together with a significant increase in current inactivation, 
      this is consistent with a loss of channel function. Molecular modeling predicted 
      disruption of a conserved disulfide bond through the C256F variant. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our results support the pathogenicity of the C256F variant for the SCA phenotype 
      and provide further insight into Cav2.1 structure and function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetics of cerebellar ataxia is complex. Hundreds of causative 
      genes have been identified, but only a few cause more than single cases. The 
      spectrum of ataxia-causing genes differs considerably between populations. The 
      aim of the study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of ataxia in the 
      Finnish population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients in hospital database were 
      reviewed for the diagnosis of unspecified ataxia. Acquired ataxias and nongenetic 
      ataxias such as those related to infection, trauma or stroke were excluded. Sixty 
      patients with sporadic ataxia with unknown etiology and 36 patients with familial 
      ataxia of unknown etiology were recruited in the study. Repeat expansions in the 
      SCA genes (ATXN1, 2, 3, 7, 8/OS, CACNA1A, TBP), FXN, and RFC1 were determined. 
      Point mutations in POLG, SPG7 and in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were investigated. 
      In addition, DNA from 8 patients was exome sequenced. RESULTS: A genetic cause of 
      ataxia was found in 33 patients (34.4%). Seven patients had a dominantly 
      inherited repeat expansion in ATXN8/OS. Ten patients had mitochondrial ataxia 
      resulting from mutations in nuclear mitochondrial genes POLG or RARS2, or from a 
      point mutation m.8561C > G or a single deletion in mtDNA. Interestingly, five 
      patients were biallelic for the recently identified pathogenic repeat expansion 
      in RFC1. All the five patients presented with the phenotype of cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia (CANVAS). Moreover, screening of 54 patients 
      with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy revealed four additional patients with 
      biallelic repeat expansion in RFC1, but none of them had cerebellar symptoms. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Expansion in ATXN8/OS results in the majority of dominant ataxias in 
      Finland, while mutations in RFC1 and POLG are the most common cause of recessive 
      ataxias. Our results suggest that analysis of RFC1 should be included in the 
      routine diagnostics of idiopathic ataxia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth polyneuropathy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is one of the most common 
      autosomal dominant ataxias in the world. Several reports revealed that CAG 
      repeats in some polyQ-containing genes may affect the age at onset (AAO) of 
      patients with SCA2, however, little studies were conducted among Chinese patients 
      with SCA2. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of CAG repeats 
      on the AAO of patients with SCA2 in China. METHODS: A total of 119 patients with 
      SCA2 were enrolled and were divided into 2 groups according to their major 
      phenotype: 17 patients from 9 families with Parkinson's syndrome were grouped as 
      the Parkinson's disease-SCA2 (PD-SAC2); 91 patients from 66 SCA2 families and 11 
      sporadic SCA2 patients were grouped as the ataxia-SCA2 (A-SCA2). Blood samples 
      were obtained from the subjects, and the CAG repeat length in ATXN2 and other 
      (CAG)(n)-containing genes was screened using fluorescent PCR. The Spearman's rank 
      correlation between the CAG repeat length in (CAG)(n)-containing genes and AAO 
      was analyzed. Regression analysis was performed to investigate whether the CAG 
      repeat length could explain the variant of AAO. A t-test was used to compare the 
      difference of CAG repeat length in (CAG)(n)-containing genes between the PD-SAC2 
      and A-SCA2 groups. RESULTS: The CAG repeat length in the longer allele of ATXN2 
      was negatively correlated with AAO of SCA2 (R=-0.251, P<0.05), and the CAG repeat 
      length could explain 41.7% of the variation of AAO. AAO negatively correlated 
      with the CAG repeat length in the shorter allele of ATXN7 (R=-0.251, P=0.006) or 
      in the longer allele of TBP gene (R=-0.197, P=0.034). A tendency of delay in the 
      AAO was also observed in patients with SCA2 carrying the CAG repeat within the 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, and RAI1. In addition, we found that the CAG repeat 
      length in ATXN7 and ATXN2 between the A-SCA2 and the PD-SCA2 groups was 
      significantly different (both P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The CAG repeat in ATXN2 is a 
      major genetic factor for the AAO of patients with SCA2 in China. The CAG repeat 
      length in ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, and RAI1 genes might be a potential factor 
      associated with the AAO of SCA2. The CAG repeat in ATXN7 might be a potential 
      factor affecting the Parkinson's syndrome in SCA2.

AB  - CTG repeat expansion (CTG(exp)) is associated with aberrant alternate splicing 
      that contributes to cardiac dysfunction in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). 
      Excision of this CTG(exp) repeat using CRISPR-Cas resulted in the disappearance 
      of punctate ribonuclear foci in cardiomyocyte-like cells derived from DM1-induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This was associated with correction of the 
      underlying spliceopathy as determined by RNA sequencing and alternate splicing 
      analysis. Certain genes were of particular interest due to their role in cardiac 
      development, maturation, and function (TPM4, CYP2J2, DMD, MBNL3, CACNA1H, ROCK2, 
      ACTB) or their association with splicing (SMN2, GCFC2, MBNL3). Moreover, while 
      comparing isogenic CRISPR-Cas9-corrected versus non-corrected DM1 cardiomyocytes, 
      a prominent difference in the splicing pattern for a number of candidate genes 
      was apparent pertaining to genes that are associated with cardiac function (TNNT, 
      TNNT2, TTN, TPM1, SYNE1, CACNA1A, MTMR1, NEBL, TPM1), cellular signaling (NCOR2, 
      CLIP1, LRRFIP2, CLASP1, CAMK2G), and other DM1-related genes (i.e., NUMA1, MBNL2, 
      LDB3) in addition to the disease-causing DMPK gene itself. Subsequent validation 
      using a selected gene subset, including MBNL1, MBNL2, INSR, ADD3, and CRTC2, 
      further confirmed correction of the spliceopathy following CTG(exp) repeat 
      excision. To our knowledge, the present study provides the first comprehensive 
      unbiased transcriptome-wide analysis of the differential splicing landscape in 
      DM1 patient-derived cardiac cells after excision of the CTG(exp) repeat using 
      CRISPR-Cas9, showing reversal of the abnormal cardiac spliceopathy in DM1.

TI  - Molecular spectrum, family screening and genetic counselling of Spinocerebellar 
      Ataxia (SCA) cases in an Indian scenario.
PG  - 370-380
LID - 10.1080/01677063.2021.1940172 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA) is a heterogeneous adult-onset disorder with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance pattern mainly caused by triplet repeat 
      expansions. Clinical diagnosis of SCA is based on phenotypic features followed by 
      confirmation through molecular diagnosis. To identify status of repeat range in 
      Indian SCA cases and provide extended family screening, we enrolled 70 clinical 
      SCA suspects. For molecular diagnosis, multiplex PCR (M-PCR) was used for common 
      Indian SCA subtypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12 and 17. TP-PCR was further used in 
      SCA2, 7 and 10 to identify larger expansions. Eighteen out of 70 SCA suspects 
      (25%) were found to be positive for various SCA subtypes- (5 SCA1 (28%), 6 SAC2 
      (34%), 2 SCA3 (12%), 3 SCA7 (16%) and one each for SCA6 (1%) and SCA17 (1%) 
      subtypes). Genetic counselling and extended family screening were offered to all 
      positive cases and yielded additional nine cases. We have established M-PCR and 
      TP-PCR to detect the CAG repeat expansion in SCA suspects. This method can 
      confirm SCA subtypes in a reliable, rapid and cost-effective way. Genetic 
      characterization of SCA-related genes has great clinical relevance, as it could 
      provide additional information and guidance to clinicians and family members 
      regarding prognosis.

      atrophy.
PG  - 117-125

AB  - PURPOSE: Investigate single nucleotide variants and short tandem repeats in 39 
      genes related to spinocerebellar ataxia in clinical and pathologically defined 
      cohorts of multiple system atrophy. METHODS: Exome sequencing was conducted in 28 
      clinical multiple system atrophy patients to identify single nucleotide variants 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes. Novel variants were validated in two 
      independent disease cohorts: 86 clinically diagnosed multiple system atrophy 
      patients and 166 pathological multiple system atrophy cases. Expanded repeat 
      alleles in spinocerebellar ataxia genes were evaluated in 36 clinically diagnosed 
      multiple system atrophy patients, and CAG/CAA repeats in TATA-Box Binding Protein 
      (TBP, causative of SCA17) were screened in 216 clinical and pathological multiple 
      system atrophy patients and 346 controls. RESULTS: No known pathogenic 
      spinocerebellar ataxia single nucleotide variants or pathogenic range expanded 
      repeat alleles of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, AXTN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, 
      and TBP were detected in any clinical multiple system atrophy patients. However, 
      four novel variants were identified in four spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes 
      across three multiple system atrophy patients. Additionally, four multiple system 
      atrophy patients (1.6%) and one control (0.3%) carried an intermediate length 41 
      TBP CAG/CAA repeat allele (OR = 4.11, P = 0.21). There was a significant 
      association between the occurrence of a repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) and an increased risk of multiple system atrophy (OR = 1.64, P = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: Occurrence of TBP CAG/CAA repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) is significantly associated with increased multiple system atrophy risk. 
      This discovery warrants further investigation and supports a possible genetic 
      overlap of multiple system atrophy with SCA17.

AB  - The genetic testing of hereditary ataxias includes screening for CAG-repeat 
      expansions as well as pathogenic variants and nontranslated oligonucleotide 
      expansion, which can cause spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). Genotype-phenotype 
      correlations of several SCA subtypes are difficult to establish, and the 
      underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report a 58-year-old male patient 
      who presented with severe generalized ataxia, horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus, 
      cognitive impairment and a positive family history of gait difficulties. Genetic 
      panel diagnostics revealed a new nonsense pathogenic variant in the CACNA1A gene 
      (c.2983G>T; p. Glu995*) that segregated with the phenotype in three clinically 
      affected family members. This gene is related to SCA type 6 (SCA6), episodic 
      ataxia type 2, familial hemiplegic migraine type 1, among others. When it is 
      supported by the clinical findings and family history, additional DNA sequencing 
      beyond fragment length analysis should be performed.

      (NM_001127221:c.1748G > A:p.Arg583Gln). A systematic literature review showed 
      that Arg583Gln is associated predominantly with progressive ataxia combined with 
      episodic disorders (overwhelmingly hemiplegic migraine) whereas Thr666Met, the 
      other most common CACNA1A missense mutation, with a combination of progressive 
      ataxia and episodic disorders in half the cases and episodic disorders only in 
      the other half. While uncertainties remain in the genotype-phenotype correlation 
      of all CACNA1A mutations, the accumulated evidence suggests that that the 
      co-occurrence of hemiplegic migraine and autosomal dominant progressive 
      cerebellar ataxia should guide the clinician to test for CACNA1A missense 
      mutation rather than CAG expansions or truncating mutations.

TI  - Conversion of individuals at risk for spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, and 6 
      to manifest ataxia (RISCA): a longitudinal cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative diseases. Our aim was to study the conversion to manifest 
      ataxia among apparently healthy carriers of mutations associated with the most 
      common SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6), and the sensitivity of clinical and 
      functional measures to detect change in these individuals. METHODS: In this 
      prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study, based at 14 referral 
      centres in seven European countries, we enrolled children or siblings of patients 
      with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6. Eligible individuals were those without ataxia, 
      defined by a score on the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) of 
      less than 3; participants had to be aged 18-50 years for children or siblings of 
      patients with SCA1, SCA2, or SCA3, and 35-70 years for children or siblings of 
      patients with SCA6. Study visits took place at recruitment and after 2, 4, and 6 
      years (plus or minus 3 months). We did genetic testing to identify mutation 
      carriers, with results concealed to the participant and clinical investigator. We 
      assessed patients with clinical scales, questionnaires of patient-reported 
      outcome measures, a rating of the examiner's confidence of presence of ataxia, 
      and performance-based coordination tests. Conversion to ataxia was defined by an 
      SARA score of 3 or higher. We analysed the association of factors at baseline 
      with conversion to ataxia and the evolution of outcome parameters on temporal 
      scales (time from inclusion and time to predicted age at ataxia onset) in the 
      context of mutation status and conversion status. This study is registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01037777. FINDINGS: Between Sept 13, 2008, and Oct 28, 
      2015, 302 participants were enrolled. We analysed data for 252 participants with 
      at least one follow-up visit. 83 (33%) participants were from families affected 
      by SCA1, 99 (39%) by SCA2, 46 (18%) by SCA3, and 24 (10%) by SCA6. In 
      participants who carried SCA mutations, 26 (52%) of 50 SCA1 carriers, 22 (59%) of 
      37 SCA2 carriers, 11 (42%) of 26 SCA3 carriers, and two (13%) of 15 SCA6 carriers 
      converted to ataxia. One (3%) of 33 SCA1 non-carriers and one (2%) of 62 SCA2 
      non-carriers converted to ataxia. Owing to the small number of people who met our 
      criteria for ataxia, subsequent analyses could not be done in carriers of the 
      SCA6 mutation. Baseline factors associated with conversion were age (hazard ratio 
      1.13 [95% CI 1.03-1.24]; p=0.011), CAG repeat length (1.25 [1.11-1.41]; 
      p=0.0002), and ataxia confidence rating (1.72 [1.23-2.41]; p=0.0015) for SCA1; 
      age (1.08 [1.02-1.14]; p=0.0077) and CAG repeat length (1.65 [1.27-2.13]; 
      p=0.0001) for SCA2; and age (1.27 [1.09-1.50]; p=0.0031), confidence rating (2.60 
      [1.23-5.47]; p=0.012), and double vision (14.83 [2.15-102.44]; p=0.0063) for 
      SCA3. From the time of inclusion, the SARA scores of SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 
      mutation carriers increased, whereas they remained stable in non-carriers. On a 
      timescale defined by the predicted time of ataxia onset, SARA progression in 
      SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 mutation carriers was non-linear, with marginal progression 
      before ataxia and increasing progression after ataxia onset. INTERPRETATION: Our 
      study provides quantitative data on the conversion of non-ataxic SCA1, SCA2, and 
      SCA3 mutation carriers to manifest ataxia. Our data could prove useful for the 
      design of preventive trials aimed at delaying the onset of ataxia by aiding 
      sample size calculations and stratification of study participants. FUNDING:

AB  - Although the heritability of cognitive function in old age is substantial, 
      genome-wide association studies have had limited success in elucidating its 
      genetic basis, leaving a considerable amount of "missing heritability." Aside 
      from single nucleotide polymorphisms, genome-wide association studies are unable 
      to assess other large sources of genetic variation, such as tandem repeat 
      polymorphisms. Therefore, here, we studied the association of 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat variations in polyglutamine 
      disease-associated genes (PDAGs) with cognitive function in older adults. In a 
      large cohort consisting of 5786 participants, we found that the CAG repeat number 
      in 3 PDAGs (TBP, HTT, and AR) were significantly associated with the decline in 
      cognitive function, which together accounted for 0.49% of the variation. 
      Furthermore, in an magnetic resonance imaging substudy, we found that CAG repeat 
      polymorphisms in 4 PDAGs (ATXN2, CACNA1A, ATXN7, and AR) were associated with 
      different imaging characteristics, including brain stem, putamen, globus 
      pallidus, thalamus, and amygdala volumes. Our findings indicate that tandem 
      repeat polymorphisms are associated with cognitive function in older adults and 
      highlight the importance of PDAGs in elucidating its missing heritability.

TI  - (CAG)(n) loci as genetic modifiers of age at onset in patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 from mainland China.
PG  - 1130-1136
LID - 10.1111/ene.13954 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The expanded repeat length in ATXN1 negatively correlates 
      with age at onset (AAO) of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) but can explain 
      only part of it, indicating that other factors affect AAO. Some studies have 
      explored the influence of non-causative CAG repeats on the AAO of SCA patients. 
      However, studies on Chinese SCA1 patients regarding candidate modifier factors 
      involved in the variability in AAO are rare. METHODS: In all, 152 Chinese SCA1 
      patients who were genotyped for ATXN1 and nine other (CAG)(n) -containing genes 
      were enrolled. Regression analysis was performed to determine the effect of the 
      expanded allele of ATXN1 (linear and quadratic effects) on AAO. Then, different 
      models were used to explore the modulatory effect of nine other (CAG)(n) 
      -containing genes. RESULTS: Our results verified the negative effect of the 
      expanded allele in ATXN1 by regression analysis. Some (CAG)(n) -containing genes 
      including TBP, ATN1 and HTT modified AAO with variance ranging from 0.8% to 3.8% 
      and tended to decrease or delay AAO. However, no modifier effects of ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, KCNN3, RAI1 and normal ATXN1 alleles in trans were 
      detected. CONCLUSION: By using interaction analyses, TBP, ATN1 and HTT were 
      determined to have modifying effects. Our study revealed that differences in 
      modulation may be due to ethnic and geographic diversity across different 
      populations. Furthermore, the variability of AAO was not completely explained by 
      the genetic modifiers examined here, suggesting that other genetic or 
      environmental factors are involved in these diseases.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to reappraise the progression of the five 
      most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) in the Chinese population and to 
      establish a much-needed critical comparison with that in other ethnic groups. 
      There are very few longitudinal cohort studies of SCAs in Asian populations. An 
      intriguing finding in an earlier study demonstrated a faster progression of SCA 
      among Chinese than that among Caucasians. METHODS: Patients with SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, SCA6 or SCA17 were consecutively assessed using the scale for the 
      assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA) for five years. A linear mixed model was 
      used to compare the annual progression rates measured using the SARA among 
      patients with different SCA subtypes. Predictors of the progression rates were 
      analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 199 patients with SCA (10 with SCA1, 37 with SCA2, 
      118 with SCA3, 25 with SCA6 and 9 with SCA17) were enrolled. The mean annual 
      increase in SARA scores was 1.23 points for SCA1, 1.52 points for SCA2, 1.60 
      points for SCA3, 0.99 points for SCA6 and 3.26 points for SCA17. A larger CAG 
      repeat length (>/=74) was associated with faster progression in SCA3, whereas a 
      lower total SARA score at the first visit (<12) was associated with faster 
      clinical progression in SCA6. CONCLUSION: The results of this study confirm that 
      the annual progression rates of SCA2 and SCA3 are comparable between Han Chinese 
      and other ethnic populations. More studies are warranted to confirm the rapid 
      progression of SCA17 observed in our cohort.

AB  - Intermediate-length ATXN2 CAG repeats are a risk factor for amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS). Here we report on a female patient with heterozygous repeat 
      expansion mutation in the CACNA1A gene presenting with a pure ALS syndrome while 
      her father, who also carries that CACNA1A mutation, suffers from a classical 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 6. Hypothesizing that CACNA1A CAG repeat expansions 
      could be a monogenic cause for familial ALS (fALS), we analyzed the CAG repeat 
      lengths in CACNA1A in a large cohort of genetically unexplained patients with 
      fALS. Our results indicate that CAG repeat expansion mutations in CACNA1A are not 
      a frequent monogenic cause of fALS but could phenotypically present as ALS in 
      rare instances.

AB  - Genomewide association studies (GWASs) have contributed greatly to unraveling the 
      genetic basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a large amount of "missing 
      heritability" remains. In this exploratory study, we investigated the effect of 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in polyglutamine disease-associated genes 
      (PDAGs) on the risk of AD and its expression. In a cohort of 959 patients 
      diagnosed with AD (Amsterdam Dementia cohort) and 4106 cognitively healthy 
      participants (Leiden 85-plus Study and the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in 
      the Elderly at Risk), we determined the CAG repeat sequences in ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, HTT, ATN1, and AR. We did not find a significant 
      association between the risk of AD and variations in CAG repeat numbers of PDAGs. 
      However, we found that differences in CAG repeat numbers in ATXN1, ATXN2, and AR 
      were significantly associated with several clinical and imaging features in AD 
      patients. Specifically, the association between memory performance in patients 
      with AD and the CAG repeat size in the longer ATXN1 allele, and the association 
      between atrophy in the medial temporal lobes and the CAG repeat number in the 
      longer AR allele remained significant after correction for multiple testing. Our 
      findings suggest that repeat polymorphisms in ATXN1 and AR can act as important 
      genetic modifiers of AD, warranting further scrutiny of their role in its missing 
      heritability and pathogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The worldwide prevalence of obesity, a major risk factor for numerous 
      debilitating chronic disorders, is increasing rapidly. Although a substantial 
      amount of the variation in body mass index (BMI) is estimated to be heritable, 
      the largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to date 
      explained only ~2.7% of the variation. To tackle this 'missing heritability' 
      problem of obesity, here we focused on the contribution of DNA repeat length 
      polymorphisms which are not detectable by GWAS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We 
      determined the cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat length in the nine known 
      polyglutamine disease-associated genes (ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, 
      HTT, ATN1 and AR) in two large cohorts consisting of 12,457 individuals and 
      analyzed their association with BMI, using generalized linear mixed-effect 
      models. RESULTS: We found a significant association between BMI and the length of 
      CAG repeats in seven polyglutamine disease-associated genes (including ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP and AR). Importantly, these repeat variations 
      could account for 0.75% of the total BMI variation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      incriminate repeat polymorphisms as an important novel class of genetic risk 
      factors of obesity and highlight the role of the brain in its pathophysiology.

AB  - Genetic testing strategies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels and 
      whole genome sequencing (WGS) can be applied to the hereditary cerebellar ataxias 
      (HCAs), but their exact role in the diagnostic pathway is unclear. We aim to 
      determine the yield from genetic testing strategies and the genetic and 
      phenotypic spectrum of HCA in Australia by analysing real-world data. We 
      performed a retrospective review on 87 HCA cases referred to the Neurogenetics 
      Clinic at the Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, Australia. Probands underwent 
      triplet repeat expansion testing; those that tested negative had NGS-targeted 
      panels and WGS testing when available. In our sample, 58.6% were male (51/87), 
      with an average age at onset of 37.1 years. Individuals with sequencing variants 
      had a prolonged duration of illness compared to those with a triplet repeat 
      expansion. The detection rate in probands for routine repeat expansion panels was 
      13.8% (11/80). NGS-targeted panels yielded a further 11 individuals (11/32, 
      34.4%), with WGS yielding 1 more diagnosis (1/3, 33.3%). NGS panels and WGS 
      improved the overall diagnostic rate to 28.8% (23/80) in 14 known HCA loci. The 
      genetic findings included novel variants in ANO10, CACNA1A, PRKCG and SPG7. Our 
      findings highlight the genetic heterogeneity of HCAs and support the use of NGS 
      approaches for individuals who were negative on repeat expansion testing. In 
      comparison to repeat disorders, individuals with sequencing variants may have a 
      prolonged duration of illness, consistent with slower progression of disease.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To study the long-term evolution of patient-reported outcome 
      measures (PROMs) in the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), we analyzed 
      8 years follow-up data of the EUROSCA Natural History Study, a cohort study of 
      526 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6. METHODS: To assess the functional 
      capacity in daily living, we used the functional assessment (part IV) of the 
      Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS-IV), for health-related quality 
      of life the visual analogue scale of the EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire 
      (EQ-5D VAS), and for depressive symptoms the Patient Health Questionnaire 
      (PHQ-9). Severity of ataxia was assessed using the Scale for the Assessment and 
      Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and neurological symptoms other than ataxia with the 
      Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS). RESULTS: UHDRS-IV [SCA1: - 1.35 (0.12); 
      SCA2: - 1.15 (0.11); SCA3: - 1.16 (0.11); SCA6: - 0.99 (0.12)] and EQ-5D [SCA1: 
      - 2.88 (0.72); SCA2: - 1.97 (0.49); SCA3: - 2.06 (0.55); SCA6: - 1.03 (0.57)] 
      decreased linearly, whereas PHQ-9 increased [SCA1: 0.15 (0.04); SCA2: 0.09 
      (0.03); SCA3: 0.06 (0.04); SCA6: 0.07 (0.04)] during the observational period. 
      Standard response means (SRMs) of UHDRS-IV (0.473-0.707) and EQ-5D VAS 
      (0.053-0.184) were lower than that of SARA (0.404-0.979). In SCA1, higher SARA 
      scores [- 0.0288 (0.01), p = 0.0251], longer repeat expansions [- 0.0622 (0.02), 
      p = 0.0002] and the presence of cognitive impairment at baseline [- 0.5381 
      (0.25), p = 0.0365] were associated with faster UHDRS-IV decline. In SCA3, higher 
      INAS counts were associated with a faster UHDRS-IV decline [- 0.05 (0.02), 
      p = 0.0212]. In SCA1, PHQ-9 progression was faster in patients with cognitive 
      impairment [0.14 (0.07); p = 0.0396]. CONCLUSIONS: In the common SCAs, PROMs give 
      complementary information to the information provided by neurological scales. 
      This underlines the importance of PROMs as additional outcome measures in future 
      interventional trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias are dominantly inherited progressive ataxia 
      disorders that can lead to premature death. We aimed to study the overall 
      survival of patients with the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, and SCA6) and to identify the strongest contributing predictors that affect 
      survival. METHODS: In this longitudinal cohort study (EUROSCA), we enrolled men 
      and women, aged 18 years or older, from 17 ataxia referral centres in ten 
      European countries; participants had positive genetic test results for SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 and progressive, otherwise unexplained, ataxias. Survival was 
      defined as the time from enrolment to death for any reason. We used the Cox 
      regression model adjusted for age at baseline to analyse survival. We used 
      prognostic factors with a p value less than 0.05 from a multivariate model to 
      build nomograms and assessed their performance based on discrimination and 
      calibration. The EUROSCA study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
      NCT02440763. FINDINGS: Between July 1, 2005, and Aug 31, 2006, 525 patients with 
      SCA1 (n=117), SCA2 (n=162), SCA3 (n=139), or SCA6 (n=107) were enrolled and 
      followed up. The 10-year survival rate was 57% (95% CI 47-69) for SCA1, 74% 
      (67-81) for SCA2, 73% (65-82) for SCA3, and 87% (80-94) for SCA6. Factors 
      associated with shorter survival were: dysphagia (hazard ratio 4.52, 95% CI 
      1.83-11.15) and a higher value for the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of 
      Ataxia (SARA) score (1.26, 1.19-1.33) for patients with SCA1; older age at 
      inclusion (1.04, 1.01-1.08), longer CAG repeat length (1.16, 1.03-1.31), and 
      higher SARA score (1.15, 1.10-1.20) for patients with SCA2; older age at 
      inclusion (1.44, 1.20-1.74), dystonia (2.65, 1.21-5.53), higher SARA score (1.26, 
      1.17-1.35), and negative interaction between CAG and age at inclusion (0.994, 
      0.991-0.997) for patients with SCA3; and higher SARA score (1.17, 1.08-1.27) for 
      patients with SCA6. The nomogram-predicted probability of 10-year survival showed 
      good discrimination (c index 0.905 [SD 0.027] for SCA1, 0.822 [0.032] for SCA2, 
      0.891 [0.021] for SCA3, and 0.825 [0.054] for SCA6). INTERPRETATION: Our study 
      provides quantitative data on the survival of patients with the most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, based on a long follow-up period. These results have 
      implications for the design of future interventional studies of spinocerebellar 
      ataxias; for example, the prognostic survival nomogram could be useful for 
      selection and stratification of patients. Our findings need validation in an 
      external population before they can be used to counsel patients and their 
      families. FUNDING: European Union 6th Framework programme, German Ministry of

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) subtypes are often caused by expansions 
      in non-coding regions of genes like SCA8, SCA10, SCA12 and SCA36. Other ataxias 
      are known to be associated with repeat expansions such as fragile X-associated 
      tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) or expansions in the C9orf72 gene. When no 
      mutation has been identified in the aforementioned genes next-generation 
      sequencing (NGS)-based diagnostics may also be applied. In order to define an 
      optimal diagnostic strategy, more information about the frequency and phenotypic 
      characteristics of rare repeat expansion disorders associated with ataxia should 
      be at hand. METHODS: We analyzed a consecutive cohort of 440 German unrelated 
      patients with symptoms of cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria and other unspecific 
      symptoms who were referred to our center for SCA diagnostics. They showed alleles 
      in the normal range for the most common SCA subtypes SCA1-3, SCA6, SCA7 and 
      SCA17. These patients were screened for expansions causing SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA36 and FXTAS as well as for the pathogenic hexanucleotide repeat in the 
      C9orf72 gene. RESULTS: Expanded repeats for SCA10, SCA12 or SCA36 were not 
      identified in the analyzed patients. Five patients showed expanded SCA8 CTA/CTG 
      alleles with 92-129 repeats. One 51-year-old male with unclear dementia symptoms 
      was diagnosed with a large GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72. The analysis of 
      the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) revealed one patient with a 
      premutation (>50 CGG repeats) and seven patients with alleles in the grey zone 
      (41 to 54 CGG repeats). CONCLUSIONS: Altogether five patients showed 92 or more 
      SCA8 CTA/CTG combined repeats. Our results support the assumption that smaller 
      FMR1 gene expansions could be associated with the risk of developing neurological 
      signs. The results do not support genetic testing for C9orf72 expansion in ataxia 
      patients.

AB  - Cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat expansions in the coding regions of nine 
      polyglutamine (polyQ) genes (HTT, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATN1, AR, 
      and TBP) are the cause of several neurodegenerative diseases including 
      Huntington's disease (HD), six different spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy. The 
      expanded CAG repeat length in the causative gene is negatively related to the 
      age-at-onset (AAO) of clinical symptoms. In addition to the expanded CAG repeat 
      length in the causative gene, the normal CAG repeats in the other polyQ genes can 
      affect the AAO, suggesting functional interactions between the polyQ genes. 
      However, there is no detailed assessment of the relationships among polyQ genes 
      in pathologically relevant brain regions. We used gene co-expression analysis to 
      study the functional relationships among polyQ genes in different brain regions 
      using the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA), a spatial map of gene expression in the 
      healthy brain. We constructed co-expression networks for seven anatomical brain 
      structures, as well as a region showing a specific pattern of atrophy in HD 
      patients detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. In this 
      HD-associated region, we found that ATN1 and ATXN2 were co-expressed and shared 
      co-expression partners which were enriched for DNA repair genes. We observed a 
      similar co-expression pattern in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and striatum in 
      which this relation was most pronounced. Given that the co-expression patterns 
      for these anatomical structures were similar to those for the HD-associated 
      region, our results suggest that their disruption is likely involved in HD 
      pathology. Moreover, ATN1 and ATXN2 also shared many co-expressed genes with HTT, 
      the causative gene of HD, across the brain. Although this triangular relationship 
      among these three polyQ genes may also be dysregulated in other polyQ diseases, 
      stronger co-expression patterns between ATN1 and ATXN2 observed in the 
      HD-associated region, especially in the striatum, may be more specific to HD.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8), an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder showing slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, is caused by a 
      tri-nucleotide CTG repeat expansion (CTGexp) in the SCA8 gene. As the CTGexp is 
      not fully penetrant, the significance of screening CTGexp in ataxia subjects 
      remains obscure. We tested SCA8 CTGexp in a cohort of 797 ataxia subjects, and if 
      present, its sequence configuration was analyzed. CTGexp was found in 16 alleles 
      from 14 individuals, 2 of which was homozygous for CTGexp. Nucleotide sequencing 
      disclosed 3 types of CTGexp sequence configurations: uninterrupted CTGexp, 
      tri-nucleotide CTA interruption and CCG interruption. The 2 individuals with 
      homozygous expansions were both sporadic cases with clinical features compatible 
      with SCA8, supporting gene dosage effect. Seven out of 14 CTGexp-positive 
      subjects were also carriers of other SCA expansions [Machado-Joseph disease 
      (n=1), SCA6 (n=3) and SCA31 (n=3)], whereas 7 others were not complicated with 
      such major SCAs. Ages of onset in subjects with pure CTGexp tended to be earlier 
      than those with interrupted CTGexp among the 7 subjects not complicated by major 
      SCAs, suggesting that pure CTGexp have stronger pathogenic effect than 
      interrupted CTGexps. The present study underscores importance of disclosing 
      sequence configuration when testing SCA8.

TI  - Postural Tremor and Ataxia Progression in Spinocerebellar Ataxias.
PG  - 492

LID - 492
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postural tremor can sometimes occur in spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs). However, the prevalence and clinical characteristics of postural tremor 
      in SCAs are poorly understood, and whether SCA patients with postural tremor have 
      different ataxia progression is not known. METHODS: We studied postural tremor in 
      315 patients with SCA1, 2, 3, and 6 recruited from the Clinical Research 
      Consortium for Spinocerebellar Ataxias (CRC-SCA), which consists of 12 
      participating centers in the United States, and we evaluated ataxia progression 
      in these patients from January 2010 to August 2012. RESULTS: Among 315 SCA 
      patients, postural tremor was most common in SCA2 patients (SCA1, 5.8%; SCA2, 
      27.5%; SCA3, 12.4%; SCA6, 16.9%; p = 0.007). SCA3 patients with postural tremor 
      had longer CAG repeat expansions than SCA3 patients without postural tremor 
      (73.67 +/- 3.12 vs. 70.42 +/- 3.96, p = 0.003). Interestingly, SCA1 and SCA6 patients 
      with postural tremor had a slower rate of ataxia progression (SCA1, beta = -0.91, p 
      < 0.001; SCA6, beta = -1.28, p = 0.025), while SCA2 patients with postural tremor 
      had a faster rate of ataxia progression (beta = 1.54, p = 0.034). We also found that 
      the presence of postural tremor in SCA2 patients could be influenced by repeat 
      expansions of ATXN1 (beta = -1.53, p = 0.037) and ATXN3 (beta = 0.57, p = 0.018), 
      whereas postural tremor in SCA3 was associated with repeat lengths in TBP (beta = 
      0.63, p = 0.041) and PPP2R2B (beta = -0.40, p = 0.032). DISCUSSION: Postural tremor 
      could be a clinical feature of SCAs, and the presence of postural tremor could be 
      associated with different rates of ataxia progression. Genetic interactions 
      between ataxia genes might influence the brain circuitry and thus affect the 
      clinical presentation of postural tremor.

PG  - 1612-1625
LID - 10.1089/scd.2017.0085 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder that is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the CACNA1A 
      gene. As one of the few bicistronic genes discovered in the human genome, CACNA1A 
      encodes not only the alpha1A subunit of the P/Q type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel 
      Ca(V)2.1 but also the alpha1ACT protein, a 75 kDa transcription factor sharing the 
      sequence of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of the alpha1A subunit. Isoforms of both 
      proteins contain the polyglutamine (polyQ) domain that is expanded in SCA6 
      patients. Although certain SCA6 phenotypes appear to be specific for Purkinje 
      neurons, other pathogenic effects of the SCA6 polyQ mutation can affect a broad 
      spectrum of central nervous system (CNS) neuronal subtypes. We investigated the 
      expression and function of CACNA1A gene products in human neurons derived from 
      induced pluripotent stem cells from two SCA6 patients. Expression levels of 
      CACNA1A encoding alpha1A subunit were similar between SCA6 and control neurons, and 
      no differences were found in the subcellular distribution of Ca(V)2.1 channel 
      protein. The alpha1ACT immunoreactivity was detected in the majority of cell nuclei 
      of SCA6 and control neurons. Although no SCA6 genotype-dependent differences in 
      Ca(V)2.1 channel function were observed, they were found in the expression levels 
      of the alpha1ACT target gene Granulin (GRN) and in glutamate-induced cell 
      vulnerability.

TI  - Genetic Screening for Spinocerebellar Ataxia Genes in a Japanese Single-Hospital 
      Cohort.
PG  - 116-122
LID - 10.14802/jmd.17011 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diagnosis of sporadic cerebellar ataxia is a challenge for 
      neurologists. A wide range of potential causes exist, including chronic alcohol 
      use, multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type (MSA-C), and sporadic late 
      cortical cerebellar atrophy. Recently, an autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) mutation was identified in a cohort of patients with non-MSA-C 
      sporadic cerebellar ataxia. The aim of this study is to genetically screen genes 
      involved in SCA in a Japanese single-hospital cohort. METHODS: Over an 8-year 
      period, 140 patients with cerebellar ataxia were observed. There were 109 
      patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia (no family history for at least four 
      generations, 73 patients with MSA-C, and 36 patients with non-MSA-C sporadic 
      cerebellar ataxia) and 31 patients with familial cerebellar ataxia. We performed 
      gene analysis comprising SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 17, 31, and 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) in 28 of 31 non-MSA-C sporadic 
      patients who requested the test. Familial patients served as a control. RESULTS: 
      Gene abnormalities were found in 57% of non-MSA-C sporadic cerebellar ataxia 
      cases. Among patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia, abnormalities in SCA6 were 
      the most common (36%), followed by abnormalities in SCA1 (7.1%), SCA2 (3.6%), 
      SCA3 (3.6%), SCA8 (3.6%), and DRPLA (3.6%). In contrast, gene abnormalities were 
      found in 75% of familial cerebellar ataxia cases, with abnormalities in SCA6 
      being the most common (29%). For sporadic versus familial cases for those with 
      SCA6 abnormalities, the age of onset was older (69 years vs. 59 years, 
      respectively), and CAG repeat length was shorter (23 vs. 25, respectively) in the 
      former than in the latter (not statistically significant). CONCLUSION: 
      Autosomal-dominant mutations in SCA genes, particularly in SCA6, are not rare in 
      sporadic cerebellar ataxia. The reason for the frequency of mutations in SCA6 
      remains unclear; however, the reason may reflect a higher age at onset and 
      variable penetrance of SCA6 mutations.

TI  - Large normal-range TBP and ATXN7 CAG repeat lengths are associated with increased 
      lifetime risk of depression.

AB  - Depression is one of the most prevalent and debilitating psychiatric disorders 
      worldwide. Recently, we showed that both relatively short and relatively long 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in the huntingtin gene (HTT) are 
      associated with an increased risk of lifetime depression. However, to what extent 
      the variations in CAG repeat length in the other eight polyglutamine 
      disease-associated genes (PDAGs) are associated with depression is still unknown. 
      We determined the CAG repeat sizes of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, 
      ATN1 and AR in two well-characterized Dutch cohorts-the Netherlands Study of 
      Depression and Anxiety and the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older 
      Persons-including 2165 depressed and 1058 non-depressed individuals-aged 18-93 
      years. The association between PDAG CAG repeat size and the risk for depression 
      was assessed via binary logistic regression. We found that the odds ratio (OR) 
      for lifetime depression was significantly higher for individuals with >10, 
      compared with subjects with </=10, CAG repeats in both ATXN7 alleles (OR=1.90, 
      confidence interval (CI) 1.26-2.85). For TBP we found a similar association: A 
      CAG repeat length exceeding the median in both alleles was associated with an 
      increased risk for lifetime depression (OR=1.33, CI 1.00-1.76). In conclusion, we 
      observed that carriers of either ATXN7 or TBP alleles with relatively large CAG 
      repeat sizes in both alleles had a substantially increased risk of lifetime 
      depression. Our findings provide critical evidence for the notion that repeat 
      polymorphisms can act as complex genetic modifiers of depression.

TI  - A panel study on patients with dominant cerebellar ataxia highlights the 
      frequency of channelopathies.
PG  - 1579-1594
LID - 10.1093/brain/awx081 [doi]
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias have a marked heterogeneous genetic 
      background, with mutations in 34 genes identified so far. This large amount of 
      implicated genes accounts for heterogeneous clinical presentations, making 
      genotype-phenotype correlations a major challenge in the field. While 
      polyglutamine ataxias, linked to CAG repeat expansions in genes such as ATXN1, 
      ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, CACNA1A and TBP, have been extensively characterized in 
      large cohorts, there is a need for comprehensive assessment of frequency and 
      phenotype of more 'conventional' ataxias. After exclusion of CAG/polyglutamine 
      expansions in spinocerebellar ataxia genes in 412 index cases with dominantly 
      inherited cerebellar ataxias, we aimed to establish the relative frequencies of 
      mutations in other genes, with an approach combining panel sequencing and TaqMan(R) 
      polymerase chain reaction assay. We found relevant genetic variants in 59 
      patients (14.3%). The most frequently mutated were channel genes [CACNA1A (n = 
      16), KCND3 (n = 4), KCNC3 (n = 2) and KCNA1 (n = 2)]. Deletions in ITPR1 (n = 11) 
      were followed by biallelic variants in SPG7 (n = 9). Variants in AFG3L2 (n = 7) 
      came next in frequency, and variants were rarely found in STBN2 (n = 2), ELOVL5, 
      FGF14, STUB1 and TTBK2 (n = 1 each). Interestingly, possible risk factor variants 
      were detected in SPG7 and POLG. Clinical comparisons showed that ataxias due to 
      channelopathies had a significantly earlier age at onset with an average of 24.6 
      years, versus 40.9 years for polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias and 
      37.8 years for SPG7-related forms (P = 0.001). In contrast, disease duration was 
      significantly longer in the former (20.5 years versus 9.3 and 13.7, P=0.001), 
      though for similar functional stages, indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. Of interest, intellectual deficiency was more frequent in channel 
      spinocerebellar ataxias, while cognitive impairment in adulthood was similar 
      among the three groups. Similar differences were found among a single gene group, 
      comparing 23 patients with CACNA1A expansions (spinocerebellar ataxia 6) to 22 
      patients with CACNA1A point mutations, which had lower average age at onset (25.2 
      versus 47.3 years) with longer disease duration (18.7 versus 10.9), but lower 
      severity indexes (0.39 versus 0.44), indicating slower progression of the 
      disease. In conclusion, we identified relevant genetic variations in up to 15% of 
      cases after exclusion of polyglutamine expansion spinocerebellar ataxias, and 
      confirmed CACNA1A and SPG7 as major ataxia genes. We could delineate firm 
      genotype-phenotype correlations that are important for genetic counselling and of 
      possible prognostic value.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder. However, it remains unclear whether SCA6 shows a gene dosage effect, 
      defined by earlier age-of-onset in homozygotes than heterozygotes. Herein, we 
      retrospectively analyzed four homozygous SCA6 subjects from our single 
      institution cohort of 120 SCA6 subjects. We also performed a neuropathological 
      investigation into an SCA6 individual with compound heterozygous expansions. In 
      the 116 heterozygotes, there was an inverse correlation of age-of-onset with the 
      number of CAG repeats in the expanded allele, and with the total number of CAG 
      repeats, in both normal and expanded alleles. The age-of-onset in the four 
      homozygotes was within the 95% confidence interval of the age-of-onset versus the 
      repeat-lengths correlations determined in the 116 heterozygotes. Nevertheless, 
      all homozygotes had earlier onset than their parents, and showed rapid disease 
      progression. Neuropathology revealed neuronal loss, as well as alpha1A-calcium 
      channel protein aggregates in Purkinje cells, a few alpha1A-calcium channel protein 
      aggregates in the neocortex and basal ganglia, and neuronal loss in Clarke's 
      column and the globus pallidus not seen in heterozygotes. These data suggest a 
      mild clinical and neuropathological gene dosage effect in SCA6 subjects.

TI  - Polyglutamine length-dependent toxicity from alpha1ACT in Drosophila models of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 1770-1775
LID - 10.1242/bio.021667 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a neurodegenerative disease that results 
      from abnormal expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat. SCA6 is caused by CAG 
      triplet repeat expansion in the gene CACNA1A, resulting in a polyQ tract of 19-33 
      in patients. CACNA1A, a bicistronic gene, encodes the alpha1A calcium channel subunit 
      and the transcription factor, alpha1ACT. PolyQ expansion in alpha1ACT causes degeneration 
      in mice. We recently described the first Drosophila models of SCA6 that express 
      alpha1ACT with a normal (11Q) or hyper-expanded (70Q) polyQ. Here, we report 
      additional alpha1ACT transgenic flies, which express full-length alpha1ACT with a 33Q 
      repeat. We show that alpha1ACT33Q is toxic in Drosophila, but less so than the 70Q 
      version. When expressed everywhere, alpha1ACT33Q-expressing adults die earlier than 
      flies expressing the normal allele. alpha1ACT33Q causes retinal degeneration and 
      leads to aggregated species in an age-dependent manner, but at a slower pace than 
      the 70Q counterpart. According to western blots, alpha1ACT33Q localizes less readily 
      in the nucleus than alpha1ACT70Q, providing clues into the importance of polyQ tract 
      length on alpha1ACT localization and its site of toxicity. We expect that these new 
      lines will be highly valuable for future work on SCA6.

      sensory neuropathy.
PG  - e123
LID - e123
AB  - Spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) is a group of disorders characterized by 
      progressive ataxia caused by dysfunction and atrophy of the cerebellum or its 
      projections. Approximately one-third of SCD cases are familial SCD, the majority 
      of which are attributed to CAG triplet repeat expansions including 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, and dentate-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      triplet repeat number of the alleles representing complete penetrance varies 
      among diseases. Generally, there is a gap between the normal alleles and the 
      complete penetrance alleles. Rarely, intermediate alleles with the repeat numbers 
      between the abnormal and normal ranges are observed, although the implications of 
      these intermediate alleles remain ambiguous.

TI  - The Initial Symptom and Motor Progression in Spinocerebellar Ataxias.
PG  - 615-622
LID - 10.1007/s12311-016-0836-3 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study is to determine whether the initial symptom associates with 
      motor progression in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). SCAs are clinically 
      heterogeneous and the initial presentation may represent different subtypes of 
      SCA with different motor progression. We studied 317 participants with SCAs1, 2, 
      3, and 6 from the Clinical Research Consortium for SCAs (CRC-SCA) and repeatedly 
      measured the severity of ataxia for 2 years. SCA patients were divided into 
      gait-onset and non-gait-onset (speech, vision, and hand dexterity) groups based 
      on the initial presentation. In addition to demographic comparison, we employed 
      regression models to study ataxia progression in these two groups after adjusting 
      for age, sex, and pathological CAG repeats. The majority of SCA patients had gait 
      abnormality as an initial presentation. The pathological CAG repeat expansions 
      were similar between the gait-onset and non-gait-onset groups. In SCA1, 
      gait-onset group progressed slower than non-gait-onset group, while gait-onset 
      SCA6 group progressed faster than their counterpart. In addition, the disease 
      presented 9 years later for SCA2 gait-onset group than non-gait-onset group. 
      Initial symptoms of SCA3 did not influence age of onset or disease progression. 
      The initial symptom in each SCA has a different influence on age of onset and 
      motor progression. Therefore, gait and non-gait-onset groups of SCAs might 
      represent different subtypes of the diseases.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease characterized by loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. SCA6 is caused 
      by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in CACNA1A, which encodes Cav2.1, alpha1A 
      subunit of P/Q-type calcium channel. However, the pathogenic mechanism and 
      effective therapeutic treatments are still unknown. Here, we have succeeded in 
      generating differentiated Purkinje cells that carry patient genes by combining 
      disease-specific iPSCs and self-organizing culture technologies. Patient-derived 
      Purkinje cells exhibit increased levels of full-length Cav2.1 protein but 
      decreased levels of its C-terminal fragment and downregulation of the 
      transcriptional targets TAF1 and BTG1. We further demonstrate that SCA6 Purkinje 
      cells exhibit thyroid hormone depletion-dependent degeneration, which can be 
      suppressed by two compounds, thyroid releasing hormone and Riluzole. Thus, we 
      have constructed an in vitro disease model recapitulating both ontogenesis and 
      pathogenesis. This model may be useful for pathogenic investigation and drug 
      screening.

TI  - An miRNA-mediated therapy for SCA6 blocks IRES-driven translation of the CACNA1A 
      second cistron.
PG  - 347ra94
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf5660 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disease characterized by slowly progressive ataxia and Purkinje cell 
      degeneration. SCA6 is caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion within a second 
      CACNA1A gene product, alpha1ACT. alpha1ACT expression is under the control of an internal 
      ribosomal entry site (IRES) present within the CACNA1A coding region. Whereas 
      SCA6 allele knock-in mice show indistinguishable phenotypes from wild-type 
      littermates, expression of SCA6-associated alpha1ACT (alpha1ACTSCA6) driven by a Purkinje 
      cell-specific promoter in mice produces slowly progressive ataxia and cerebellar 
      atrophy. We developed an early-onset SCA6 mouse model using an adeno-associated 
      virus (AAV)-based gene delivery system to ectopically express CACNA1A IRES-driven 
      alpha1ACTSCA6 to test the potential of CACNA1A IRES-targeting therapies. Mice 
      expressing AAV9-mediated CACNA1A IRES-driven alpha1ACTSCA6 exhibited early-onset 
      ataxia, motor deficits, and Purkinje cell degeneration. We identified miR-3191-5p 
      as a microRNA (miRNA) that targeted CACNA1A IRES and preferentially inhibited the 
      CACNA1A IRES-driven translation of alpha1ACT in an Argonaute 4 (Ago4)-dependent 
      manner. We found that eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), eIF4AII and eIF4GII, 
      interacted with the CACNA1A IRES to enhance alpha1ACT translation. Ago4-bound 
      miR-3191-5p blocked the interaction of eIF4AII and eIF4GII with the CACNA1A IRES, 
      attenuating IRES-driven alpha1ACT translation. Furthermore, AAV9-mediated delivery of 
      miR-3191-5p protected mice from the ataxia, motor deficits, and Purkinje cell 
      degeneration caused by CACNA1A IRES-driven alpha1ACTSCA6 We have established proof of 
      principle that viral delivery of an miRNA can rescue a disease phenotype through 
      modulation of cellular IRES activity in a mouse model.

TI  - Expanding the Spectrum of Genes Involved in Huntington Disease Using a Combined 
      Clinical and Genetic Approach.
PG  - 1105-14
LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2016.2215 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Huntington disease (HD), a prototypic monogenic disease, is caused by 
      an expanded CAG repeat in the HTT gene exceeding 35 units. However, not all 
      patients with an HD phenotype carry the pathological expansion in HTT, and the 
      positive diagnosis rate is poor. OBJECTIVES: To examine patients with HD 
      phenotypes to determine the frequency of HD phenocopies with typical features of 
      HD but without pathological CAG repeat expansions in HTT in an attempt to improve 
      the positive diagnosis rate. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between January 
      1, 2004, and April 18, 2011, a total of 226 consecutive index patients with an HD 
      phenotype were referred to specialized clinics of the French National Huntington 
      Disease Reference Centre for Rare Diseases. They underwent detailed clinical 
      examination and follow-up, as well as neuropsychological, biological, imaging, 
      and genetic examinations. Nucleotide expansions in JPH3, ATN1, TBP, and C9ORF72 
      and mutations in PRNP, as well as acquired conditions commonly causing HD 
      phenocopies, were first screened. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The diagnostic rate 
      of HD phenocopies and frequency of other etiologies using deep clinical 
      phenotyping and next generation sequencing. Our goal was to improve the genetic 
      diagnosis of HD phenocopies and to identify new HD related genes. RESULTS: One 
      hundred ninety-eight patients carried a pathological CAG repeat expansion in HTT, 
      whereas 28 patients (12 women and 16 men) did not. Huntington disease phenocopies 
      accounted for 12.4%, and their mean (SD) age at onset was similar to those of the 
      HD-HTT group (47.3 [12.7] years vs 50.3 [16.4] years, P = .29). We first 
      identified 3 patients with abnormal CTG expansions in JPH3, a fourth patient with 
      an antiphospholipid syndrome, and a fifth patient with B12 avitaminosis. A 
      custom-made 63-gene panel was generated based on clinical evolution and exome 
      sequencing. It contained genes responsible for HD phenocopies and other 
      neurodegenerative conditions, as well as candidate genes from exome sequencing in 
      3 index cases with imaging features of brain iron accumulation. We identified 
      mutations in genes associated with neurodegeneration, including CACNA1A (n = 2), 
      VPS13A (n = 1), UBQLN2 (n = 1), and VCP (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Huntington disease phenocopies without CAG repeat expansions in HTT are not rare, 
      occurring in 12.4% (28 of 226) herein, and should be considered in genetic 
      counseling. We used next-generation sequencing combined with clinical data and 
      disease evolution to explore multiple etiologies simultaneously. Our combined 
      clinical and genetic exploration of 28 HD phenocopies identified the underlying 
      cause in 35.7% (10 of 28). In conclusion, the etiologies of HD phenocopies are 
      heterogeneous, and clinical evolution should be taken into account when searching 
      for a genetic cause. The panel of candidate genes to be examined is larger than 
      expected but can be guided by specific imaging and clinical features. Other 
      neurodegenerative diseases with late onset in which variant segregation cannot be 
      verified could be productively explored with the combined approach illustrated 
      herein.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The natural history of clinical symptoms in the spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCA)s has been well characterised. However there is little longitudinal 
      data comparing cognitive changes in the most common SCA subtypes over time. The 
      present study provides a preliminary longitudinal characterisation of the 
      clinical and cognitive profiles in patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7, 
      with the aim of elucidating the role of the cerebellum in cognition. METHODS: 13 
      patients with different SCAs all caused by CAG repeat expansion (SCA1, n = 2; 
      SCA2, n = 2; SCA3, n = 2; SCA6, n = 4; and SCA7, n = 3) completed a comprehensive 
      battery of cognitive and mood assessments at two time points, a mean of 
      7.35 years apart. All patients were evaluated clinically using the Scale for the 
      Rating and Assessment of Ataxia (SARA) and the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs 
      (INAS). Patients underwent structural MRI imaging at follow-up. RESULTS: Clinical 
      scale scores increased in all patients over time, most prominently in the SCA1 
      (SARA) and SCA3 (INAS) groups. New impairments on neuropsychological tests were 
      most commonly observed with executive functions, speed, attention, visual memory 
      and Theory of Mind. Results suggest possible differences in cognitive decline in 
      SCA subtypes, with the most rapid cognitive decline observed in the SCA1 
      patients, and the least in the SCA6 patients, congruent with observed patterns of 
      motor deterioration. Minimal changes in mood were observed, and MRI measures of 
      atrophy did not correlate with cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: As well as 
      increasing physical impairment, cognitive decline over time appears to be a 
      distinct aspect of the SCA phenotype, in keeping with the cerebellar 
      cognitive-affective syndrome. Our data suggest a trend of cognitive decline that 
      is different for each SCA subtype, and for the majority is related to the 
      severity of cerebellar motor impairment.

TI  - Rapid Onset of Motor Deficits in a Mouse Model of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 6 
      Precedes Late Cerebellar Degeneration.
LID - 10.1523/ENEURO.0094-15.2015 [doi]
LID - ENEURO.0094-15.2015
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is an autosomal-dominant cerebellar ataxia 
      that has been associated with loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Disease onset is 
      typically at midlife, although it can vary widely from late teens to old age in 
      SCA6 patients. Our study focused on an SCA6 knock-in mouse model with a 
      hyper-expanded (84X) CAG repeat expansion that displays midlife-onset motor 
      deficits at  approximately 7 months old, reminiscent of midlife-onset symptoms in SCA6 
      patients, although a detailed phenotypic analysis of these mice has not yet been 
      reported. Here, we characterize the onset of motor deficits in SCA6(84Q) mice 
      using a battery of behavioral assays to test for impairments in motor 
      coordination, balance, and gait. We found that these mice performed normally on 
      these assays up to and including at 6 months, but motor impairment was detected 
      at 7 months with all motor coordination assays used, suggesting that motor 
      deficits emerge rapidly during a narrow age window in SCA6(84Q) mice. In contrast 
      to what is seen in SCA6 patients, the decrease in motor coordination was observed 
      without alterations in gait. No loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells or striatal 
      neurons were observed at 7 months, the age at which motor deficits were first 
      detected, but significant Purkinje cell loss was observed in 2-year-old SCA6(84Q) 
      mice, arguing that Purkinje cell death does not significantly contribute to the 
      early stages of SCA6.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias are dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      diseases. As potential treatments for these diseases are being developed, precise 
      knowledge of their natural history is needed. We aimed to study the long-term 
      disease progression of the most common spinocerebellar ataxias: SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, 
      and SCA6. Furthermore, we aimed to establish the order and occurrence of 
      non-ataxia symptoms, and identify predictors of disease progression. METHODS: In 
      this longitudinal cohort study (EUROSCA), we enrolled men and women with positive 
      genetic testing for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 and with progressive, otherwise 
      unexplained ataxia who were aged 18 years or older from 17 ataxia referral 
      centres in ten European countries. Patients were seen every year for 3 years, and 
      at irregular intervals thereafter. The primary outcome was the scale for the 
      assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA), and the inventory of non-ataxia signs 
      (INAS). We used linear mixed models to analyse progression. To account for 
      dropouts, we applied a pattern-mixture model. This study is registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02440763. FINDINGS: Between July 1, 2005, and Aug 
      31, 2006, 526 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 were enrolled. We analysed 
      data for 462 patients with at least one follow-up visit. Median observation time 
      was 49 months (IQR 35-72). SARA progression data were best fitted with a linear 
      model in all genotypes. Annual SARA score increase was 2.11 (SE 0.12) in patients 
      with SCA1, 1.49 (0.07) in patients with SCA2, 1.56 (0.08) in patients with SCA3, 
      and 0.80 (0.09) in patients with SCA6. The increase of the number of non-ataxia 
      signs reached a plateau in SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3. In patients with SCA6, the 
      number of non-ataxia symptoms increased linearly, but more slowly than in 
      patients with SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 (p<0.0001). Factors that were associated with 
      faster progression of the SARA score were short duration of follow-up (p=0.0179), 
      older age at inclusion (0.04 [SE 0.02] per additional year; p=0.0476), and longer 
      repeat expansions (0.06 [SE 0.02] per additional repeat unit; p=0.0128) in SCA1, 
      short duration of follow-up (p<0.0001), lower age at onset (-0.02 [SE 0.01] per 
      additional year; p=0.0014), and lower baseline SARA score (-0.02 [SE 0.01] per 
      additional SARA point; p=0.0083) in SCA2, and lower baseline SARA score (-0.03 
      [SE 0.01] per additional SARA point; p=0.0195) in SCA6. In SCA3, we did not 
      identify factors that affected progression of the SARA score. INTERPRETATION: Our 
      study provides quantitative data on the progression of the most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxias based on a follow-up period that exceeds those of 
      previous studies. Our data could prove useful for sample size calculation and 
      patient stratification in interventional trials. FUNDING: EU FP6 (EUROSCA),

TI  - Analysis of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, SCA17 and SCA19 in patients with unknown 
      spinocerebellar ataxia: a Thai multicentre study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: About 50 % of Thai patients with adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) was Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6. The author 
      investigated further on less common SCAs in the patients without any known 
      mutations. METHODS: DNA samples of 82 index patients who were genetically 
      excluded MJD, SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) were examined. Analysis of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, SCA17 and SCA19 genes were 
      comprehensively performed. Normal range of trinucleotide repeat expansion sizes 
      of TATA-box-binding protein gene (TBP) were also determined in 374 control 
      subjects. RESULTS: Eight patients carried >/=42 CAG/CAA repeat allele in the TBP 
      consistent with SCA17. The pathological repeat alleles ranged from 42 to 57 
      repeats. All patients had significant degree of cognitive dysfunction. Other 
      non-ataxic phenotypes comprised of parkinsonism, chorea, dystonia and myoclonus. 
      A sporadic patient carried a heterozygous 41-repeat allele developed chronic 
      progressive cerebellar degeneration commenced at the age of 28 years. Whilst, 2 % 
      of the control subjects (8/374) carried the 41-repeat allele. Five of the 
      carriers were re-examined, and revealed that four of them had parkinsonism and/or 
      cognitive impairment without cerebellar signs. Analysis of other types of SCAs 
      was all negative. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA17 and SCA19 in Thais. SCA17 appears to be an important cause of ataxia in 
      Thailand. Although, the pathological cut-off point of the TBP repeat allele 
      remains unclear, the finding suggests that the 41-repeat may be a pathological 
      allele resulting late-onset or mild phenotype. Apart from ataxia, cognitive 
      impairment and parkinsonism may be clinical presentations in these carriers.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aim to clarify the pathogenic role of intermediate size repeat 
      expansions of SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 as risk factors for idiopathic 
      Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: We invited researchers from the Genetic 
      Epidemiology of Parkinson's Disease Consortium to participate in the study. There 
      were 12,346 cases and 8,164 controls genotyped, for a total of 4 repeats within 
      the SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 genes. Fixed- and random-effects models were used 
      to estimate the summary risk estimates for the genes. We investigated 
      between-study heterogeneity and heterogeneity between different ethnic 
      populations. RESULTS: We did not observe any definite pathogenic repeat 
      expansions for SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 genes in patients with idiopathic PD 
      from Caucasian and Asian populations. Furthermore, overall analysis did not 
      reveal any significant association between intermediate repeats and PD. The 
      effect estimates (odds ratio) ranged from 0.93 to 1.01 in the overall cohort for 
      the SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 loci. CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not support a 
      major role for definite pathogenic repeat expansions in SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and 
      SCA17 genes for idiopathic PD. Thus, results of this large study do not support 
      diagnostic screening of SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA17 gene repeats in the common 
      idiopathic form of PD. Likewise, this largest multicentered study performed to 
      date excludes the role of intermediate repeats of these genes as a risk factor 
      for PD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association of repeat expansion size in 10 common 
      degenerative hereditary ataxia genes with essential tremor. These genes were 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 
      (CACNA1A), SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), 
      SCA-17 (TBP) and dentatorubral-pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA) (ATN1). METHODS: 
      Genetic analysis of repeat size in 10 degenerative hereditary ataxia loci was 
      performed in 323 essential tremor patients and 299 controls enrolled at Columbia 
      University. To test for differences in the allele distribution between patients 
      and controls, a CLUMP analysis was performed. RESULTS: None of the essential 
      tremor patients had a repeat expansion in the intermediate or pathogenic range. 
      Significant differences in the distribution of repeats in the 'normal' range for 
      SCA2 and SCA8 (both p </= 0.02) were observed between essential tremor patients and 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      SCA loci are not associated with essential tremor.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are characterized by autosomal dominantly 
      inherited progressive ataxia but are clinically heterogeneous due to variable 
      involvement of non-cerebellar parts of the nervous system. Non-cerebellar 
      symptoms contribute significantly to the burden of SCAs, may guide the clinician 
      to the underlying genetic subtype, and might be useful markers to monitor 
      disease. Peripheral neuropathy is frequently observed in SCA, but 
      subtype-specific features and subclinical manifestations have rarely been 
      evaluated. We performed a multicenter nerve conduction study with 162 patients 
      with genetically confirmed SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6. The study proved 
      peripheral nerves to be involved in the neurodegenerative process in 82 % of 
      SCA1, 63 % of SCA2, 55 % of SCA3, and 22 % of SCA6 patients. Most patients of all 
      subtypes revealed affection of both sensory and motor fibers. Neuropathy was most 
      frequently of mixed type with axonal and demyelinating characteristics in all SCA 
      subtypes. However, nerve conduction velocities of SCA1 patients were slower 
      compared to other genotypes. SCA6 patients revealed less axonal damage than 
      patients with other subtypes. No influence of CAG repeat length or biometric 
      determinants on peripheral neuropathy could be identified in SCA1, SCA3, and 
      SCA6. In SCA2, earlier onset and more severe ataxia were associated with 
      peripheral neuropathy. We proved peripheral neuropathy to be a frequent site of 
      the neurodegenerative process in all common SCA subtypes. Since damage to 
      peripheral nerves is readily assessable by electrophysiological means, nerve 
      conduction studies should be performed in a longitudinal approach to assess these 
      parameters as potential progression markers.

TI  - Identification of 46 CAG repeats within PPP2R2B as probably the shortest

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) is predominantly characterized 
      by action tremor, followed by slowly progressive cerebellar dysfunction. It is a 
      very rare disorder and only identified in certain countries so far. The current 
      appreciation for phenotypic and genotypic features of SCA12 is still limited. 
      METHODS: We investigated CAG copies within PPP2R2B in 29 patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia who are excluded from the most common SCA subtypes 
      including SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6. The medical data of patients carrying 
      abnormal expanded PPP2R2B allele were reviewed and summarized. RESULTS: We found 
      that 3 patients carried 53, 46 and 54 CAG repeats respectively, while the other 
      26 cases harbored CAG repeats less than 30. The probably shortest pathogenic 
      allele of 46 repeats was detected in one kindred typically experiencing action 
      tremor. Additionally, compared to the prominent cerebellar ataxia, nystagmus and 
      dysphagia seem to be rare in our SCA12 patients. CONCLUSIONS: SCA12 might not be 
      as rare in Chinese as previously assumed. The identification of the shortest 
      pathogenic allele helps to define the minimal limit implicated in the disease 
      onset. Moreover, the disease manifestations distinct from other SCA subtypes 
      could help clinicians to provide timely genetic counseling.

AB  - In spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), the vestibular dysfunction and its 
      correlation with other clinical parameters require further exploration. We 
      determined vestibular responses over a broad range of stimulus acceleration in 11 
      patients with SCA6 (six men, age range=33-72 years, mean age+/-SD=59+/-12 years) 
      using bithermal caloric irrigations, rotary chair, and head impulse tests. 
      Correlations were also pursued among disability scores, as measured using the 
      International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale, disease duration, age at onset, 
      cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat length, and the gain of the 
      vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). In response to relatively low-acceleration, 
      low-frequency rotational and bithermal caloric stimuli, the VOR gains were normal 
      or increased regardless of the severity of disease. On the other hand, with 
      relatively high-acceleration, high-frequency head impulses, there was a relative 
      increase in gain in the mildly affected patients and a decrease in gain in the 
      more severely affected patients and gains were negatively correlated with the 
      severity of disease (Spearman correlation, R=-0.927, p<0.001). Selective decrease 
      of the vestibular responses during high-acceleration, high-frequency stimuli may 
      be ascribed to degeneration of either the flocculus or vestibular nuclei. The 
      performance of the VOR during high-acceleration, high-frequency head impulses may 
      be a quantitative indicator of clinical decline in SCA6.

AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that are related 
      to at least 36 different genetic loci; they are clinically characterized by 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia and are frequently accompanied by other 
      neurological and non-neurological manifestations. The relative frequency of SCA 
      varies greatly among different regions, presumably because of a founder effect or 
      local ethnicities. Between July 1998 and May 2012, we investigated 320 Brazilian 
      patients with an SCA phenotype who belonged to 150 unrelated families with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and 23 sporadic patients from 13 Brazilian 
      states. A total of 265 patients (82.8%) belonging to 131 unrelated families 
      (87.3%) were found to have a definite mutation, and SCA3 accounted for most of 
      the familial cases (70.7%), followed by SCA7 (6%), SCA1 (5.3%), SCA2 (2.7%), SCA6 
      (1.3%), SCA8 (0.7%) and SCA10 (0.7%). In the Ribeirao Preto mesoregion, which is 
      located in the northeast part of Sao Paulo State, the prevalence of SCA3 was 
      approximately 5 per 100,000 inhabitants, which is the highest prevalence found in 
      Brazil. No mutation was found in the SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA genes, and all the 
      sporadic cases remained without a molecular diagnosis. This study further 
      characterizes the spectrum of SCA mutations found in Brazilian patients, which 
      suggests the existence of regional differences and demonstrates the expansion of 
      the SCA8 locus in Brazilian families.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA)--SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and 
      SCA6--are caused by (CAG)n repeat expansion. While the number of repeats of the 
      coding (CAG)n expansions is correlated with the age at onset, there are no 
      appropriate models that include both affected and preclinical carriers allowing 
      for the prediction of age at onset. METHODS: We combined data from two major 
      European cohorts of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6 mutation carriers: 1187 affected 
      individuals from the EUROSCA registry and 123 preclinical individuals from the 
      RISCA cohort. For each SCA genotype, a regression model was fitted using a 
      log-normal distribution for age at onset with the repeat length of the alleles as 
      covariates. From these models, we calculated expected age at onset from birth and 
      conditionally that this age is greater than the current age. RESULTS: For SCA2 
      and SCA3 genotypes, the expanded allele was a significant predictor of age at 
      onset (-0.105+/-0.005 and -0.056+/-0.003) while for SCA1 and SCA6 genotypes both the 
      size of the expanded and normal alleles were significant (expanded: -0.049+/-0.002 
      and -0.090+/-0.009, respectively; normal: +0.013+/-0.005 and -0.029+/-0.010, 
      respectively). According to the model, we indicated the median values (90% 
      critical region) and the expectancy (SD) of the predicted age at onset for each 
      SCA genotype according to the CAG repeat size and current age. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      estimations can be valuable in clinical and research. However, results need to be 
      confirmed in other independent cohorts and in future longitudinal studies.

AB  - We evaluated the contributions of various polyglutamine (polyQ) disease genes to 
      Parkinson's disease (PD). We compared the distributions of polyQ repeat lengths 
      in 8 common genes (ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, TBP, ATN1, and HTT) in 
      299 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant PD (ADPD) and 329 normal controls. 
      We also analyzed the possibility of genetic interactions between ATXN1 and ATXN2, 
      ATXN2 and ATXN3, and ATXN2 and CACNA1A. Intermediate-length polyQ expansions (>24 
      Qs) of ATXN2 were found in 7 ADPD patients and no controls (7/299 = 2.34% and 
      0/329 = 0%, respectively; p = 0.0053 < 0.05/8 after Bonferroni correction). These 
      patients showed typical L-DOPA-responsive PD phenotypes. Conversely, no 
      significant differences in polyQ repeat lengths were found between the ADPD 
      patients and the controls for the other 7 genes. Our results may support the 
      hypothesis that ATXN2 polyQ expansion is a specific predisposing factor for 
      multiple neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) and familial 
      hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1) are allelic disorders of the gene CACNA1A 
      encoding the P/Q subunit of a voltage gated calcium channel. While SCA6 is 
      related to repeat expansions affecting the C-terminal part of the protein, EA2 
      and FHM phenotypes are usually associated with nonsense and missense mutations 
      leading to impaired channel properties. In three unrelated families with dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia, symptoms cosegregated with CACNA1A missense mutations of 
      evolutionary highly conserved amino acids (exchanges p.E668K, p.R583Q and 
      p.D302N). To evaluate pathogenic effects, in silico, protein modeling analyses 
      were performed which indicate structural alterations of the novel mutation 
      p.E668K within the homologous domain 2 affecting CACNA1A protein function. The 
      phenotype is characterised by a very slowly progressive ataxia, while ataxic 
      episodes or migraine are uncommon. These findings enlarge the phenotypic spectrum 
      of CACNA1A mutations.

AB  - Limited data exist on the spectrum of heredoataxias in Greece, including the 
      prevalence and phenotype of Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) and the prevalence and 
      subtypes of dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). We analyzed clinically and 
      investigated genetically for FRDA and triplet-repeat expansion SCAs a consecutive 
      series of 186 patients with suspected heredoataxia referred to Athens over 18 
      years. For prevalence estimates we included patients with molecular diagnosis 
      from Cyprus that were absent from the Athens cohort. The minimum prevalence of 
      FRDA was ~0.9/100,000, with clusters of high prevalence in Aegean islands. FRDA 
      was diagnosed in 73 probands. The genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of FRDA was 
      similar to other populations, with one patient compound heterozygote for a known 
      point mutation in FXN (Asn146Lys). Undiagnosed recessive ataxias included 
      FRDA-like and spastic ataxias. The minimum prevalence of dominant SCAs was 
      ~0.7/100,000. SCA1 (4), SCA7 (4), SCA2, SCA6, and SCA17 (1 each) probands were 
      identified. A molecular diagnosis was reached in 31% of dominant cases. 
      Undiagnosed dominant patients included a majority of type III autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxias. FRDA is the commonest heredoataxia in the Greek population 
      with prevalence towards the lower end of other European populations. Dominant 
      SCAs are almost as prevalent. SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and SCA17 patients complete 
      the spectrum of cases with a specific molecular diagnosis.

      clinical decline in SCA1, SCA3 and SCA6.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias are dominantly inherited disorders that are associated 
      with progressive brain degeneration, mainly affecting the cerebellum and 
      brainstem. As part of the multicentre European integrated project on 
      spinocerebellar ataxias study, 37 patients with spinocerebellar ataxia-1, 19 with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-3 and seven with spinocerebellar ataxia-6 were clinically 
      examined and underwent magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and after a 2-year 
      follow-up. All patients were compared with age-matched and gender-matched healthy 
      control subjects. Magnetic resonance imaging analysis included three-dimensional 
      volumetry and observer-independent longitudinal voxel-based morphometry. 
      Volumetry revealed loss of brainstem, cerebellar and basal ganglia volume in all 
      genotypes. Most sensitive to change was the pontine volume in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia-1, striatal volume in spinocerebellar ataxia-3 and caudate volume in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-6. Sensitivity to change, as measured by standard response 
      mean, of the respective MRI measures was greater than that of the most sensitive 
      clinical measure, the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia. Longitudinal 
      voxel-based morphometry revealed greatest grey matter loss in the cerebellum and 
      brainstem in spinocerebellar ataxia-1, in the putamen and pallidum in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-3 and in the cerebellum, thalamus, putamen and pallidum in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-6. There was a mild correlation between CAG repeat length 
      and volume loss of the bilateral cerebellum and the pons in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia-1. Quantitative volumetry and voxel-based morphometry imaging demonstrated 
      genotype-specific patterns of atrophy progression in spinocerebellar ataxias-1, 3 
      and 6, and they showed a high sensitivity to detect change that was superior to 
      clinical scales. These structural magnetic resonance imaging findings have the 
      potential to serve as surrogate markers, which might help to delineate 
      quantifiable endpoints and non-invasive methods for rapid and reliable data 
      acquisition, encouraging their use in clinical trials.

TI  - Cerebellar ataxia, hemiplegic migraine, and related phenotypes due to a CACNA1A 
      missense mutation: 12-year follow-up of a large Portuguese family.
PG  - 235-40
LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2013.591 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To document and discuss the broad phenotypic variability in a 
      Portuguese family with cerebellar ataxia, hemiplegic migraine, and related 
      syndromes caused by missense mutation c.1748 (p.R583Q) in the CACNA1A gene. 
      DESIGN: Observational 12-year follow-up study. SETTING: Community and hospital 
      care. PATIENTS: Sixteen patients in a 4-generation family were identified in 1998 
      in a population-based survey. The follow-up revealed 28 patients (25 of whom were 
      observed) and 32 unaffected relatives with an a priori risk of 50%. RESULTS: Four 
      major phenotypes (migraine with multiple auras, transient focal neurological 
      deficits without headache, coma triggered by minor head trauma, and slowly 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia) were present in various combinations. The initial 
      manifestation was ataxia in 16 patients and a transient episode in 12 patients. 
      Eighteen patients did not have migraine, and 11 showed only ataxia. The c.1748 
      (p.R583Q) mutation in CACNA1A was confirmed in all 23 of the patients who were 
      tested but was not found in any of the 27 adult relatives. The CACNA1A CAG repeat 
      expansion was excluded. CONCLUSIONS: A unique missense mutation in the CACNA1A 
      gene, which exhibits a very high penetrance and expressivity, may present a 
      phenotypic spectrum that is broader than current descriptions. Single-gene 
      disorders can behave as complex traits, which reinforces the importance of 
      genetic modifiers in the tightly regulated function of P/Q-type calcium channels. 
      The clinical spectrum of missense mutation CACNA1A -related disorders is much 
      broader than strictly familial hemiplegic migraine.

PG  - 159-65
LID - 10.1111/cge.12114 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. CAG (cytosine-adenine-guanine) trinucleotide repeat expansions in the 
      causative genes have been identified as the cause of different SCA. In this 
      study, we simultaneously genotyped SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 applying a 
      fluorescent multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay. We analyzed 10 families 
      with SCA (64 patients) from five different communities of Veracruz, a Mexican 
      southeastern state, and identified 55 patients for SCA7 and 9 for SCA2, but none 
      for SCA1, SCA3, or SCA6. To our knowledge, this sample represents one of the 
      largest series of SCA7 cases reported worldwide. Genotyping of 300 healthy 
      individuals from Mexican population and compiled data from different ethnicities 
      showed discordant results concerning the hypothesis that SCA disease alleles 
      arise by expansion of large normal alleles.

AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) encompass a heterogeneous group of 
      rare diseases that affect the cerebellum and its connections. The most common 
      forms have been associated with dynamic mutations while some rarer forms with 
      conventional mutations. Studies in different populations revealed differences in 
      their relative frequencies both within and between the studied populations, 
      showing that the frequencies are depended on ethnic and geographical factors. 
      Previous investigation of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in the Cypriot population, revealed no 
      pathogenic expansion in the Cypriot SCA patients. We hereby present our recent 
      investigation of the SCA10 pentanucleotide repeat expansion. Forty-two 
      ascertained Cypriot sporadic ataxia patients, the index case from 1 ADCA and 14 
      ARCA families and a cohort of normal population individuals were included in the 
      study. All our patients have normal range ATXN10 gene ATTCT repeat numbers 
      (10-19). In the normal population group, repeat lengths ranged from 11 to 20 with 
      the 14 repeats allele being the most frequent. Therefore, all currently 
      established dynamic repeat SCA mutations are absent from the Cypriot population, 
      indicating distinct genetic causes.

AB  - The relative frequency of different autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, 
      commonly referred to as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), varies considerably among 
      populations of different ethnic origin. No data exist at present on the frequency 
      of different SCAs in the Greek population. In the present study we investigated 
      the presence of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in a cohort of 83 Greek patients with slowly 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia. Twenty patients came from autosomal dominant (AD) 
      pedigrees, seven displayed recessive or unclear inheritance and 56 were sporadic. 
      We found four patients with pathological SCA expansions, all from AD pedigrees. 
      Two patients had SCA1, one SCA2 and one SCA7 (10.0, 5.0 and 5.0% of the AD group, 
      respectively). The clinical features of these patients were within the expected 
      spectrum. In total, a pathological expansion was detected in 20% of patients from 
      AD pedigrees. Interestingly, no cases of SCA3 or SCA6 were detected in the AD 
      group. No expansions were found in other familial cases or in sporadic patients. 
      Overall, no cases of SCA3, SCA6, SCA12, SCA17 or DRPLA were identified in the 
      Greek population. In conclusion, SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 are present in Greek 
      patients with AD cerebellar ataxia in frequencies similar to those observed in 
      other populations. SCA3 and SCA6 appear however to be rare in Greece. The genetic 
      cause for the majority of AD ataxias remains to be identified.

TI  - Visual Suppression is Impaired in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 6 but Preserved in 
      Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo.
PG  - 52-6
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics2040052 [doi]
AB  - Positional vertigo is a common neurologic emergency and mostly the etiology is 
      peripheral. However, central diseases may mimic peripheral positional vertigo at 
      their initial presentation. We here describe the results of a visual suppression 
      test in six patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), a central 
      positional vertigo, and nine patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo 
      (BPPV), the major peripheral positional vertigo. As a result, the visual 
      suppression value of both diseases differed significantly; e.g., 22.5% in SCA6 
      and 64.3% in BPPV (p < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between the 
      visual suppression value and disease duration, cerebellar atrophy, and CAG repeat 
      length of SCA6 but they were not statistically significant. In conclusion, the 
      present study showed for the first time that visual suppression is impaired in 
      SCA6, a central positional vertigo, but preserved in BPPV, the major peripheral 
      positional vertigo, by directly comparing both groups. The abnormality in the 
      SCA6 group presumably reflects dysfunction in the central visual fixation pathway 
      at the cerebellar flocculus and nodulus. This simple test might aid differential 
      diagnosis of peripheral and central positional vertigo at the earlier stage of 
      disease.

TI  - Lower Urinary Tract Function in Spinocerebellar Ataxia 6.
PG  - 41-4
LID - 10.1111/j.1757-5672.2011.00111.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate lower urinary tract function in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 6 (SCA6). METHODS: We recruited, without bias, nine SCA6 patients with a 
      mean cytosine-adenine-guanine repeat length of 24.3 (21-26, normal <18). They 
      were four men, five women; mean age 58.6 years; mean disease duration 8.2 years. 
      We performed a urinary symptom questionnaire and a urodynamics. RESULTS: Urinary 
      symptoms were observed in five of nine patients (56%) and urinary frequency in 
      three of nine patients (33%), and none had urinary retention. Urodynamic 
      abnormalities included detrusor overactivity in one (11%) and weak detrusor on 
      voiding in two, but none had postvoid residual urine. Sphincter electromyography 
      revealed, while mild in degree, neurogenic change in five of the eight patients 
      (63%) on whom the test was performed. CONCLUSION: We observed urinary frequency 
      in 33%; detrusor overactivity in only 11%; and neurogenic change in the sphincter 
      electromyography in 63% of our nine SCA6 patients. These findings might be 
      relevant to the cerebellar and spinal cord pathologies of this disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain quantitative data on the progression of the most common 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) and identify factors that influence their 
      progression, we initiated the EUROSCA natural history study, a multicentric 
      longitudinal cohort study of 526 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6. We 
      report the results of the 1- and 2-year follow-up visits. METHODS: As the primary 
      outcome measure we used the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA, 
      0-40), and as a secondary measure the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Symptoms (INAS, 
      0-16) count. RESULTS: The annual increase of the SARA score was greatest in SCA1 
      (2.18 +/- 0.17, mean +/- SE) followed by SCA3 (1.61 +/- 0.12) and SCA2 (1.40 +/- 0.11). 
      SARA progression in SCA6 was slowest and nonlinear (first year: 0.35 +/- 0.34, 
      second year: 1.44 +/- 0.34). Analysis of the INAS count yielded similar results. 
      Larger expanded repeats and earlier age at onset were associated with faster SARA 
      progression in SCA1 and SCA2. In SCA1, repeat length of the expanded allele had a 
      similar effect on INAS progression. In SCA3, SARA progression was influenced by 
      the disease duration at inclusion, and INAS progression was faster in females. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study gives a comprehensive quantitative account of disease 
      progression in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA6 and identifies factors that 
      specifically affect disease progression.

TI  - Splice isoform-specific suppression of the Cav2.1 variant underlying 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 533-42
LID - 10.1016/j.nbd.2011.04.016 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in the Ca(V)2.1 voltage-gated calcium 
      channel subunit (CACNA1A). There is currently no treatment for this debilitating 
      disorder and thus a pressing need to develop preventative therapies. RNA 
      interference (RNAi) has proven effective at halting disease progression in 
      several models of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), including SCA types 1 and 3. 
      However, in SCA6 and other dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorders, 
      RNAi-based strategies that selectively suppress expression of mutant alleles may 
      be required. Using a Ca(V)2.1 mini-gene reporter system, we found that pathogenic 
      CAG expansions in Ca(V)2.1 enhance splicing activity at the 3'end of the 
      transcript, leading to a CAG repeat length-dependent increase in the levels of a 
      polyQ-encoding Ca(V)2.1 mRNA splice isoform and the resultant disease protein. 
      Taking advantage of this molecular phenomenon, we developed a novel splice 
      isoform-specific (SIS)-RNAi strategy that selectively targets the polyQ-encoding 
      Ca(V)2.1 splice variant. Selective suppression of transiently expressed and 
      endogenous polyQ-encoding Ca(V)2.1 splice variants was achieved in a variety of 
      cell-based models including a human neuronal cell line, using a new artificial 
      miRNA-like delivery system. Moreover, the efficacy of gene silencing correlated 
      with effective intracellular recognition and processing of SIS-RNAi miRNA mimics. 
      These results lend support to the preclinical development of SIS-RNAi as a 
      potential therapy for SCA6 and other dominantly inherited diseases.

AB  - The diagnosis and incidence of spinocerebelar ataxias (SCA) is sometimes 
      difficult to analyze due the overlap of phenotypes subtypes and are disorders of 
      mutations caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion. To investigate the 
      incidence of the SCA in Southern Brazil, we analyzed the trinucleotide repeats 
      (CAG)n at the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and SCA7 loci to identify allele size ranges 
      and frequencies. We examined blood sample from 154 asymptomatic blood donors and 
      115 individuals with progressive ataxias. PCR products were submitted to 
      capillary electrophoresis. In the blood donors, the ranges of the five loci were: 
      SCA1, 19 to 36 (CAG)n; SCA2, 6 to 28 (CAG)n; SCA3, 12 to 34 (CAG)n; SCA6, 2 to 13 
      (CAG)n; and SCA7, 2 to 10 (CAG)n. No deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
      were detected. In the ataxia group, we found (CAG)n above the range of the 
      asymptomatic blood donors in SCA3 (21.74%) followed by SCA2 (5.22%), SCA7 
      (2.61%), SCA6 (0.87%), and no cases of SCA1. The remaining 80 cases (69.56%) have 
      different diagnoses from the type here studied. These data defined the alleles 
      and their frequencies, as well as demonstrated their stability in the population 
      not affected. The molecular diagnosis test confirmed the clinical diagnosis in 
      28/45 cases and classified another 7/70 from the clinical unclassified ataxias 
      group.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Biomarkers to monitor neurological dysfunction in 
      autosomal dominant inherited spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are lacking. We 
      therefore aimed to visualize, quantify and correlate localized brain atrophy with 
      clinical symptoms in SCA1, SCA3, and SCA6. METHODS: We compared patients 
      suffering from SCA1 (n=48), SCA3 (n=24), and SCA6 (n=10) with 32 controls using 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on four different scanners in eight centers 
      followed by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and quantitative three-dimensional (3D) 
      volumetry. RESULTS: SCA1 and SCA3 patients presented with severe atrophy in total 
      brainstem (consisting of midbrain, pons, and medulla), pons, medulla, total 
      cerebellum, cerebellar hemispheres and cerebellar vermis, putamen and caudate 
      nucleus. Atrophy in the cerebellar hemispheres was less severe in SCA3 than in 
      SCA1 and SCA6. Atrophy in SCA6 was restricted to the grey matter of the 
      cerebellum (VBM and volumetry), total brainstem and pons (volumetry only). 
      Overall, we did not observe substantial atrophy in the cerebral cortex. A 
      discriminant analysis taking into account data from pons, cerebellar hemispheres, 
      medulla, midbrain and putamen achieved a reclassification probability of 81.7% 
      for SCA1, SCA3, and SCA6. The repeat length of the expanded allele showed a weak 
      negative correlation with the volume of the brainstem, pons, caudate nucleus and 
      putamen in SCA3, and a weak correlation with the pons in SCA1, whereas no such 
      correlation was found in SCA6. Clinical dysfunction as measured by the Scale for 
      the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and the Unified Huntington's Disease 
      Rating Scale functional assessment correlated best with the atrophy of pons in 
      SCA1, with total brainstem atrophy in SCA3 and atrophy of total cerebellum in 
      SCA6. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide strong evidence that MRI is an attractive 
      surrogate marker for clinical studies of SCA. In each SCA genotype clinical 
      dysfunction may be caused by different patho-anatomical processes.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of spinocerebellar ataxias in Cuba: insights into SCA2 
      founder effect in Holguin.
PG  - 157-60
LID - 10.1016/j.neulet.2009.03.015 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of hereditary ataxias 
      in Cuba, with a special focus on the clinical and molecular features of SCA2. 
      Clinical assessments were performed by neurological examinations and application 
      of the SARA scale. Molecular analyses of genes SCA1-3, SCA6, SCA17 and DRPLA 
      identified 753 patients with SCA and 7173 asymptomatic relatives, belonging to 
      200 unrelated families. 86.79% of all SCA patients were affected with SCA2. In 
      the Holguin province, the average population prevalence of SCA2 is 40.18x10(5) 
      inhabitants, with the remarkable figure of 141.66x10(5) in the Baguanos 
      municipality. The high prevalence of the SCA2 mutation in Holguin reflects most 
      likely a founder effect. The stabilization of the prevalence along time suggests 
      the existence of premutated chromosomes with pure CAG, acting as reservoir for 
      further expansions. CAG repeat length correlated inversely with age at onset, 
      accounting for 80% of the variability. Genetic anticipation was observed in the 
      80% of transmissions. Repeat instability was greater in paternal transmissions 
      whereas CAG expansions without anticipation was observed in 10.97% suggesting the 
      effect of CAA interruptions in the CAG segment, which decrease the toxicity of 
      the abnormal ataxin-2, and/or other protective factors.

TI  - The genetic aetiology of late-onset chronic progressive cerebellar ataxia. A 
      population-based study.
PG  - 343-8
LID - 10.1007/s00415-009-0015-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increasing number of dominant and recessive disorders have been 
      associated with late onset chronic progressive ataxia (LOCA) complicating the 
      formulation of a rational diagnostic strategy. Furthermore, there is marked 
      geographic and ethnic variation in the relative importance of these individual 
      disorders and the cause of such observed variation remains unexplained. METHODS: 
      We have systematically investigated a population-based cohort of patients with 
      chronic progressive LOCA for SCA 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17, FXTAS and FRDA. In 
      addition we have examined repeat length polymorphism in chromosomes from a 
      genetically homogeneous and representative control population to investigate the 
      association of high-normal repeats and disease prevalence. RESULTS: A total of 
      178 patients including 55 familial cases segregating in 38 kindreds and 123 
      sporadic were investigated. Pathological expansions were identified in 11/38 
      (28.9 %) of families and in 5/123 (4.1 %) of sporadic patients. The most frequent 
      diagnoses were SCA6 (6 families and 1 sporadic patient), DRPLA (4 families) and 
      SCA8 (1 family). In addition, one elderly female patient was identified with 
      "possible FXTAS". Six (2 %) control patients were noted to have expanded SCA8 
      alleles. CONCLUSIONS: SCA6 and DRPLA were the most frequent genetic diagnoses 
      identified. Patterns of high-normal allele frequency in this UK population were 
      distinct compared to other ethnic groups but this was poorly predictive of the 
      distribution of disease in this region. The relative contribution of new mutation 
      formation and founder effects to the prevalence of familial ataxia is uncertain, 
      and further exploration of these factors will require detailed analysis of 
      disease allele haplotypes and meiotic instability of intermediate length alleles.

TI  - Vertigo and vestibular abnormalities in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 78-82
LID - 10.1007/s00415-009-0068-2 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a calcium channelopathy due to a 
      pathological CAG repeat expansion in CACNL1A4. Patients frequently describe 
      paroxysmal vertigo early in the disease course, but it is not clear whether this 
      is central or labyrinthine in origin. To address this issue we studied 21 SCA6 
      patients. Symptoms of vertigo were defined using a structured questionnaire. 
      Signs were recorded during a standardised bed-side vestibular examination that 
      included systematic positional testing with Frenzel goggles.Brief, recurrent 
      attacks of vertigo occurred in 13 patients, usually preceding the onset of 
      ataxia. Nystagmus was observed behind Frenzel goggles in 14 patients, and was 
      induced either during positional testing, or head shaking in 20 patients. Only 
      one patient had findings typical of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). 
      Combined downbeat and horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus ("side-pocket") was the 
      most common form, occurring most commonly in supine and head-hanging positions, 
      and following horizontal head-shaking. Nystagmus beating away from the ground 
      (apogeotropic) occurred in 9 patients as they lay on their side.In conclusion, 
      vertigo and abnormalities on bedside vestibular examination are common in SCA6, 
      with forms of nystagmus typical of cerebellar, rather than labyrinthine, disease. 
      These findings demonstrate phenotypic overlap between SCA6 and episodic ataxia 
      type 2, which are both due to mutations in CACNL1A4.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA 6) is an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia 
      caused by CAG repeat expansion in the SCA6 gene, a alpha 1A voltage-dependent 
      calcium channel subunit gene on chromosome 19p13. SCA-6 is characterized 
      predominantly by slowly progressive pure cerebellar ataxia with late onset. We 
      report three index patients, with pure, late onset, cerebellar ataxia, belonging 
      to three different Brazilian families, all of them with Japanese ancestry, from 
      Hokkaido island of Japan.

PG  - 2232-8
LID - 10.1002/mds.22288 [doi]
AB  - Onset of genetically determined neurodegenerative diseases is difficult to 
      specify because of their insidious and slowly progressive nature. This is 
      especially true for spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) because of varying affection of 
      many parts of the nervous system and huge variability of symptoms. We 
      investigated early symptoms in 287 patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, or SCA6 and 
      calculated the influence of CAG repeat length on age of onset depending on (1) 
      the definition of disease onset, (2) people defining onset, and (3) duration of 
      symptoms. Gait difficulty was the initial symptom in two-thirds of patients. 
      Double vision, dysarthria, impaired hand writing, and episodic vertigo preceded 
      ataxia in 4% of patients, respectively. Frequency of other early symptoms did not 
      differ from controls and was regarded unspecific. Data about disease onset varied 
      between patients and relatives for 1 year or more in 44% of cases. Influence of 
      repeat length on age of onset was maximum when onset was defined as beginning of 
      permanent gait disturbance and cases with symptoms for more than 10 years were 
      excluded. Under these conditions, CAG repeat length determined 64% of onset 
      variability in SCA1, 67% in SCA2, 46% in SCA3, and 41% in SCA6 demonstrating 
      substantial influence of nonrepeat factors on disease onset in all SCA subtypes. 
      Identification of these factors is of interest as potential targets for disease 
      modifying compounds. In this respect, recognition of early symptoms that develop 
      before onset of ataxia is mandatory to determine the shift from presymptomatic to 
      affected status in SCA.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 knockin mice develop a progressive neuronal 
      dysfunction with age-dependent accumulation of mutant CaV2.1 channels.
PG  - 11987-92
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0804350105 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      CAG repeat expansions within the voltage-gated calcium (Ca(V)) 2.1 channel gene. 
      It remains controversial whether the mutation exerts neurotoxicity by changing 
      the function of Ca(V)2.1 channel or through a gain-of-function mechanism 
      associated with accumulation of the expanded polyglutamine protein. We generated 
      three strains of knockin (KI) mice carrying normal, expanded, or hyperexpanded 
      CAG repeat tracts in the Cacna1a locus. The mice expressing hyperexpanded 
      polyglutamine (Sca6(84Q)) developed progressive motor impairment and aggregation 
      of mutant Ca(V)2.1 channels. Electrophysiological analysis of cerebellar Purkinje 
      cells revealed similar Ca(2+) channel current density among the three KI models. 
      Neither voltage sensitivity of activation nor inactivation was altered in the 
      Sca6(84Q) neurons, suggesting that expanded CAG repeat per se does not affect the 
      intrinsic electrophysiological properties of the channels. The pathogenesis of 
      SCA6 is apparently linked to an age-dependent process accompanied by accumulation 
      of mutant Ca(V)2.1 channels.

PG  - 982-9

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify factors that determine disease severity and clinical 
      phenotype of the most common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), we studied 526 
      patients with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3. or SCA6. METHODS: To measure the severity of 
      ataxia we used the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). In 
      addition, nonataxia symptoms were assessed with the Inventory of Non-Ataxia 
      Symptoms (INAS). The INAS count denotes the number of nonataxia symptoms in each 
      patient. RESULTS: An analysis of covariance with SARA score as dependent variable 
      and repeat lengths of the expanded and normal allele, age at onset, and disease 
      duration as independent variables led to multivariate models that explained 60.4% 
      of the SARA score variance in SCA1, 45.4% in SCA2, 46.8% in SCA3, and 33.7% in 
      SCA6. In SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3, SARA was mainly determined by repeat length of the 
      expanded allele, age at onset, and disease duration. The only factors determining 
      the SARA score in SCA6 were age at onset and disease duration. The INAS count was 
      5.0 +/- 2.3 in SCA1, 4.6 +/- 2.2 in SCA2, 5.2 +/- 2.5 in SCA3, and 2.0 +/- 1.7 in 
      SCA6. In SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3, SARA score and disease duration were the strongest 
      predictors of the INAS count. In SCA6, only age at onset and disease duration had 
      an effect on the INAS count. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) 1, SCA2, and SCA3 share a number of common biologic properties, 
      whereas SCA6 is distinct in that its phenotype is more determined by age than by 
      disease-related factors.

AB  - We report a family with 16q-ADCA(16q 22.1 linked autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia) coexisting with SCA8 repeat expansion. The brothers in this family 
      presented with pyramidal signs, tremor, myoclonus and mental retardation in 
      addition to cerebellar symptom in childhood. They showed both C-to-T substitution 
      puratrophin-1 gene and an expanded allele of the SCA8 gene in the brothers and 
      their father. These siblings presented with atypical symptoms and early onset age 
      as16q-ADCA. Although it remains controversial whether the expanded SCA8 allele is 
      associated with cerebellar symptoms, the coexistence of SCA8 repeat expansion 
      with SCA6 was reported previously. Pure or predominant cerebellar symptoms were 
      found in patients with SCA8, SCA6 and 16q-ADCA. In addition, common findings in 
      neuropathology of SCA8, SCA6 and 16q-ADCA have been reported. We suppose that 
      coexistence of SCA8 repeat expansion with 16q-ADCA may be involved in the 
      pathogenesis and severe symptoms in this family.

      spinal cord was assessed by high resolution T1-weighted MRI of patients with SCA3 
      (n = 14) and SCA6 (n = 10). Furthermore, two groups of age- and sex-matched 
      healthy control subjects (n = 24,) corresponding to the two SCA groups, were 
      studied. Images were post-processed by a semi-automated volumetry method 
      combining a marker based segmentation and an automatic histogram method 
      facilitating highly reliable quantification and morphometry of the upper cervical 
      cord in vivo. RESULTS: We found a significant reduction of normalized mean 
      crosssectional area of the spinal cord in SCA3 (p < 0.0005), whereas in SCA6 
      patients normalized mean crosssectional area was in the normal range (p = 0.379). 
      No correlation was found between spinal cord atrophy and disease duration as well 
      as CAG repeat length in both subtypes. In SCA6 a negative dependency between 
      clinical disability, as expressed by the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating 
      Scale as a well established ataxia score, and the mean cross-sectional area was 
      found (p = 0.02). A similar correlation was observed in SCA3 but did not reach 
      statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Our results quantify for the first time in 
      vivo spinal cord atrophy as a non-cerebellar neurodegenerative process in SCA3. 
      Our results suggest MR volumetry of the upper cervical cord as a marker of 
      functional importance in SCA3 and SCA6.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) comprise a clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorders 
      affecting the cerebellum and to variable degrees further parts of the nervous 
      system. Electrophysiology is a potent tool to prove impairment of multiple 
      neuronal systems and fibre tracts and even to decipher subclinical affection. 
      Electrooculography, evoked potentials, nerve conduction studies and 
      polysomnography are especially helpful in the setting of SCAs. Severely slowed 
      saccades are a hallmark of SCA2. Vertical nystagmus occurs most frequently in 
      SCA3 and SCA6. Visual potentials recede especially in SCA7. Substantially 
      prolonged central motor conduction times in motor-evoked potentials occur 
      frequently in SCA1 even in patients without clinical signs of pyramidal 
      affection. Thus, electrophysiological analyses may help to predict the SCA 
      genotype and direct molecular genetic diagnostics. Polysomnography is a helpful 
      tool in the analysis of sleep disorders and frequently helps to decipher 
      treatable causes like periodic leg movement in sleep and REM sleep behaviour 
      disorder in SCAs. Nerve conduction studies reveal sensory neuropathy in all 
      common SCA subtypes, but to variable degrees. Age rather than CAG repeat length 
      appears to be the most important determinant for neuropathy and makes sensory 
      nerve action potentials a potential progression marker in SCA.

TI  - Pathogenic expansions of the SCA6 locus are associated with a common CACNA1A 
      haplotype across the globe: founder effect or predisposing chromosome?
PG  - 841-7
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2008.20 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a common cause of dominantly inherited 
      ataxia due to an expansion of the CAG repeat in the CACNA1A gene. Affected 
      individuals from the same population share a common haplotype, raising the 
      possibility that most SCA6 cases have descended from a small number of common 
      founders across the globe. To test this hypothesis, we carried out haplotype 
      analysis on SCA6 families from Europe, South America and the Far East, including 
      an established de novo SCA6 expansion. A core CACNA1A disease haplotype was found 
      in affected individuals across the globe. This was also present in the unaffected 
      father of the de novo case, suggesting that the shared chromosome predisposes to 
      the CAG repeat expansion at the SCA6 locus. The SCA6 expansion lies within a CpG 
      island, which could act as a cis-acting element predisposing to repeat expansion 
      as for other CAG/CTG repeat diseases. Polymorphic variation in this region may 
      explain the high-risk haplotype found in SCA6 families.

TI  - Prolonged cortical silent period but normal sensorimotor plasticity in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 6.
PG  - 378-85
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 6 (SCA6) is a hereditary disease characterized by a 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the CACNA1A gene and late-onset bilateral 
      cerebellar atrophy. It is unclear if there is significant pathology outside of 
      the cerebellum. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation to assess sensorimotor 
      cortical circuits and cortical plasticity in 8 SCA6 patients and 8 age-matched 
      controls. Behavioral performance was assessed using a rhythmic tapping task. 
      Neurophysiological measures of SCA6 patients showed a prolonged cortical silent 
      period (CSP) but normal MEP recruitment curve, short-latency afferent inhibition, 
      long-latency afferent inhibition and ipsilateral silent period. 
      Paired-associative stimulation induction also increased motor-evoked potentials 
      normally. SCA6 patients had greater variability with cued rhythmic tapping than 
      normals and deteriorated when the cue was removed; in comparison, normal subjects 
      had similar variability between cued and uncued rhythmic tapping. Analysis using 
      a Wing-Kristofferson timing model indicated that both clock variance and motor 
      delay variance were abnormal. Conclusion. In SCA6, the circuits for sensorimotor 
      integration and the mechanisms for LTP-like plasticity in the sensorimotor cortex 
      are unimpaired. A prolonged CSP in SCA6 just like in other cerebellar atrophies 
      would suggest that this neurophysiological change typifies cerebellar 
      dysfunction.

TI  - Case control analysis of repeat expansion size in ataxia.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurological diseases. The expansion of unstable microsatellite 
      repeats has been identified as the underlying pathogenic cause of 10 subtypes of 
      autosomal dominant SCAs. The aetiology of sporadic SCA is unknown. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effect of large normal repeats in patients 
      presenting with sporadic or familial ataxia compared to a control population. The 
      size of the expansion was determined using a fluorescent PCR approach in 10 
      common SCA genes: SCA-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 (CACNA1A), 
      SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), SCA-17 (TBP) 
      and DRPLA (ATN1), in 165 ataxia patients and 307 controls of Welsh origin. There 
      was no difference between cases and controls in the distribution of the large 
      normal alleles, or in the distribution of the combined CAG repeats. The normal 
      allele distribution in the Welsh population was largely similar to that of other 
      Caucasian populations. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of large normal 
      repeats on the susceptibility to develop ataxia.

TI  - Cognitive impairment in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 496-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate cognitive impairment in patients 
      with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) and to verify the role of cerebellar 
      involvement in intellectual abilities. METHODS: Cognitive function was examined 
      in 18 patients with genetically confirmed SCA6 and in 21 age and education 
      matched controls using a test battery for attention, verbal and visuospatial 
      memory, as well as executive function. RESULTS: Verbal fluency and immediate 
      visual memory task were markedly impaired in SCA6 compared with the control group 
      (p = 0.007, 0.004 and 0.014, respectively). The results of the Rule Shift Cards 
      Test was reduced in patients with SCA6, but the reduction was not significant. 
      These cognitive dysfunctions did not correlated with CAG repeat length, age at 
      onset, ataxic motor dysfunctional scale or depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      demonstrate that specific cognitive deficits occur in patients with SCA6, 
      independent of ataxic motor dysfunction. These deficits may reflect disruption of 
      cortico-cerebellar circuits.

TI  - Identification of the porcine homologous of human disease causing trinucleotide 
      repeat sequences.
PG  - 207-18
AB  - Expansion in the repeat number of intragenic trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) is 
      associated with a variety of inherited human neurodegenerative diseases. To study 
      the composition of TNRs in a mammalian species representing an evolutionary 
      intermediate between humans and rodents, we describe in this paper the 
      identification of porcine noncoding and polyglutamine-encoding TNR regions and 
      the comparison to the homologous TNRs from human, chimpanzee, dog, opossum, rat, 
      and mouse. Several of the porcine TNR regions are highly polymorphic both within 
      and between different breeds. The TNR regions are more conserved in terms of 
      repeat length between humans and pigs than between humans and rodents suggesting 
      that TNR lengths could be implicated in mammalian evolution. The TNRs in the 
      FMR2, SCA6, SCA12, and Huntingtin genes are comparable in length to alleles 
      naturally occurring in humans, and also in FMR1, a long uninterrupted CGG TNR was 
      identified. Most strikingly, we identified a Huntingtin allele with 21 
      uninterrupted CAG repeats encoding a stretch of 24 polyglutamines. Examination of 
      this particular Huntingtin TNR in 349 porcine offspring showed stable 
      transmission. The presence in the porcine genome of TNRs within genes that, in 
      humans, can undergo pathogenic expansions support the usage of the pig as an 
      alternative animal model for studies of TNR evolution, stability, and functional 
      properties.

TI  - Multiplex families with multiple system atrophy.
PG  - 545-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) has been considered a sporadic disease, 
      without patterns of inheritance. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical features of 
      4 multiplex families with MSA, including clinical genetic aspects. DESIGN: 
      Clinical and genetic study. SETTING: Four departments of neurology in Japan. 
      Patients Eight patients in 4 families with parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and 
      autonomic failure with age at onset ranging from 58 to 72 years. Two siblings in 
      each family were affected with these conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical 
      evaluation was performed according to criteria by Gilman et al. Trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the responsible genes for the spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 
      series and for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) was evaluated by 
      polymerase chain reaction. Direct sequence analysis of coding regions in the 
      alpha-synuclein gene was performed. RESULTS: Consanguineous marriage was observed 
      in 1 of 4 families. Among 8 patients, 1 had definite MSA, 5 had probable MSA, and 
      2 had possible MSA. The most frequent phenotype was MSA with predominant 
      parkinsonism, observed in 5 patients. Six patients showed pontine atrophy with 
      cross sign or slitlike signal change at the posterolateral putaminal margin or 
      both on brain magnetic resonance imaging. Possibilities of hereditary ataxias, 
      including SCA1 (ataxin 1, ATXN1), SCA2 (ATXN2), Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3 
      (ATXN1), SCA6 (ATXN1), SCA7 (ATXN7), SCA12 (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory 
      subunit B, beta isoform; PP2R2B), SCA17 (TATA box binding protein, TBP) and DRPLA 
      (atrophin 1; ATN1), were excluded, and no mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene 
      were found. CONCLUSIONS: Findings in these multiplex families suggest the 
      presence of familial MSA with autosomal recessive inheritance and a genetic 
      predisposition to MSA. Molecular genetic approaches focusing on familial MSA are 
      expected to provide clues to the pathogenesis of MSA.

TI  - New RNAi strategy for selective suppression of a mutant allele in polyglutamine 
      disease.
PG  - 298-302
AB  - In gene therapy of dominantly inherited diseases with small interfering RNA 
      (siRNA), mutant allele specific suppression may be necessary for diseases in 
      which the defective gene normally has an important role. It is difficult, 
      however, to design a mutant allele-specific siRNA for trinucleotide repeat 
      diseases in which the difference of sequences is only repeat length. To overcome 
      this problem, we use a new RNA interference (RNAi) strategy for selective 
      suppression of mutant alleles. Both mutant and wild-type alleles are inhibited by 
      the most effective siRNA, and wild-type protein is restored using the wild-type 
      mRNA modified to be resistant to the siRNA. Here, we applied this method to 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6). We discuss its feasibility and problems for 
      future gene therapy.

TI  - CAG repeats in Restless Legs syndrome.
PG  - 173-6
AB  - Recent reports established an association of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) type 1, 2, and 3. To evaluate the contribution of 
      SCA alleles to idiopathic RLS we investigated the CAG repeat length at the SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, and SCA17 loci in 215 patients who fulfilled the clinical 
      criteria of RLS and presented periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS) in 
      polysomnographic recording. Fifty percent of patients had a positive family 
      history of RLS. We found one intermediate (CAG)(43) allele for SCA17 in a 
      44-year-old female with RLS starting at the age of 43. Neurologic examination and 
      family history were unremarkable in this patient. Otherwise, allele distribution 
      did not differ between RLS patients and healthy controls. Stratification for age, 
      age of onset, sex, peripheral neuropathy, and sporadic or familial RLS revealed 
      no effect. Thus, CAG repeat length in the investigated genes is not a major 
      determinant of idiopathic or familial RLS.

TI  - Meiotic CAG repeat instability in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6: maternally 
      transmitted elongation in a presumed sporadic case.
PG  - 95-8
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is an autosomal dominantly inherited 
      disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. The 
      molecular background for the disorder is a CAG repeat expansion in the CACNA1A 
      gene located on chromosome 19. The size of SCA6 expanded alleles is usually 
      stable, and variation in repeat size over successive generations is rare. We 
      report a Danish family with one case of SCA6 resembling a sporadic case of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia. Analysis of the CACNA1A gene showed meiotic CAG repeat 
      instability in the transmission from a 70-year-old woman with no subjective 
      symptoms to her symptomatic son. The CAG repeat size expanded from 22 repeats in 
      the mother to 23 repeats in the proband. This case demonstrates maternal repeat 
      instability and clinical anticipation in a family with SCA6.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2: polyQ repeat variation in the CACNA1A calcium 
      channel modifies age of onset.
PG  - 2297-303
AB  - Nine neurodegenerative diseases, collectively referred to as polyglutamine 
      (polyQ) diseases, are caused by expansion of a coding CAG DNA trinucleotide 
      repeat. PolyQ diseases show a strong inverse correlation between CAG repeat 
      length and age of disease onset (AO). Despite this, individuals with identical 
      repeat expansion alleles can have highly variable disease onset indicating that 
      other factors also influence AO. We examined AO in 148 individuals in 57 sibships 
      from the SCA2 founder population in Cuba. The mutant CAG repeat allele explained 
      57% of AO variance. To estimate heritability of the residual variance after 
      correction for SCA2 repeat length, we applied variance component analysis and 
      determined the coefficient of intraclass correlation. We found that 55% of the 
      residual AO variance was familial. To test candidate modifier alleles in this 
      population, we selected 64 unrelated individuals from a set of 394 individuals 
      who were highly discordant for AO after correction for SCA2 CAG repeat length. We 
      hypothesized that long normal alleles in the other 8 polyQ disease genes were 
      associated with premature disease onset in SCA2. Of the 8 genes tested, only long 
      normal CAG repeats in the CACNA1A gene were associated with disease onset earlier 
      than expected based on SCA2 CAG repeat size using non-parametric tests for 
      alleles (P < 0.04) and genotypes (P < 0.023) after correction for multiple 
      comparisons. CACNA1A variation explained 5.8% of the residual variation in AO. 
      The CACNA1A calcium channel subunit represents an excellent candidate as a 
      modifier of disease in SCA2. It is highly expressed in Purkinje cells (PCs) and 
      is essential for the generation of the P/Q current and the complex spike in PCs. 
      In contrast to other polyQ proteins, which are nuclear, the CACNA1A and SCA2 
      proteins are both cytoplasmic. Furthermore, small pathologic expansions of the 
      polyQ domain in the CACNA1A protein lead to PC degeneration in SCA6. Future 
      studies are needed to determine whether the modifier effect of CACNA1A relates to 
      neuronal dysfunction or cell death of Purkinje neurons.

TI  - Degeneration of the inferior olive in spinocerebellar ataxia 6 may depend on 
      disease duration: report of two autopsy cases and statistical analysis of autopsy 
      cases reported to date.
PG  - 125-35
AB  - This report concerns a clinicopathological study of two autopsied patients with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 6 (SCA6), and a statistical analysis between neuronal loss 
      of the inferior olive and disease duration of 15 SCA6 autopsy cases reported to 
      date, including the two cases reported in this study. Cases 1 and 2 came from 
      independent Japanese families. Case 1 developed gait disturbance at age 35 years 
      and died at age 78 years; she had a CAG-repeat expansion of the SCA6 gene 
      (25/13). Case 2 presented with gait disturbance at age 68 years and died at age 
      78 years; he had an expanded CAG-repeat of the SCA6 gene (22/13). 
      Neuropathological examination of both cases disclosed not only neuronal loss of 
      the Purkinje cells and inferior olive, but also some unnoticed features, 
      including cactus-like expansion of the dendrite of Purkinje cells and relative 
      preservation of Golgi cells in the granular layer of the cerebellum. Exploratory 
      statistical analysis between 11 SCA6 autopsy cases with neuronal loss in the 
      inferior olive (average disease duration: 27 years) and four SCA6 autopsy cases 
      without neuronal loss in the olive (average disease duration: 14.5 years) was 
      investigated by Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival and log-rank test, 
      retrospectively. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival revealed an obvious 
      difference between the two groups. Survival of 10 years after the disease onset 
      was 90.9% in the former 11 SCA6 autopsy cases, but was 50% in the latter four 
      SCA6 autopsy cases. Furthermore, a log-rank test on the two groups disclosed a 
      significant difference (P=0.0450). We postulate that the neuronal loss of the 
      inferior olive in SCA6 may depend on disease duration.

TI  - Age at onset variance analysis in spinocerebellar ataxias: a study in a 
      Dutch-French cohort.
PG  - 505-12
AB  - In dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), the issue of whether non-CAG 
      dependent factors contribute to onset age remains unsettled. Data on SCA 
      genotype, onset age, normal/expanded CAG repeat length, sex of the patient and 
      transmitting parent, and family details were available from 802 patients. Based 
      on the model [log(10) (age at onset) = k - b CAG(exp) + epsilon], we examined 
      changes in adjusted R(2) and residual standard error following incorporation of 
      the other factors in this model. The expanded repeat explained 44.3 to 74.9% of 
      onset age variance, although this was less than 50% in SCA3 and SCA6, implicating 
      a large effect of non-CAG factors. The relation between onset age and CAG repeat 
      was similar for SCA1, 3, 6, and 7, but different for SCA2, pointing to different 
      polyglutamine effects in SCA2. For SCA2 and SCA3, 17.1 and 45.5% of onset age 
      variance, respectively, were explained by currently (unidentified) familial 
      factors. We found a significant contribution of the nonexpanded allele in SCA1 
      and SCA6. Besides polyglutamine motif (determined by the expanded CAG repeat 
      length), we identified the following age at onset modifiers: protein context in 
      SCA2; familial factors in SCA2 and SCA3; and the nonexpanded CAG repeat in SCA1 
      and SCA6.

TI  - Comparative genetics of functional trinucleotide tandem repeats in humans and 
      apes.
PG  - 329-39
AB  - Several human neurodegenerative disorders are caused by the expansion of 
      polymorphic trinucleotide repeat regions. Many of these loci are functional short 
      tandem repeats (STRs) located in brain-expressed genes, and their study is thus 
      relevant from both a medical and an evolutionary point of view. The aims of our 
      study are to infer the comparative pattern of variation and evolution of this set 
      of loci in order to show species-specific features in this group of STRs and on 
      their potential for expansion (therefore, an insight into evolutionary medicine) 
      and to unravel whether any human-specific feature may be identified in 
      brain-expressed genes involved in human disease. We analyzed the variability of 
      the normal range of seven expanding STR CAG/CTG loci (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3-MJD, SCA6, 
      SCA8, SCA12, and DRPLA) and two nonexpanding polymorphic CAG loci (KCNN3 and 
      NCOA3) in humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. The study showed a 
      general conservation of the repetitive tract and of the polymorphism in the four 
      species and high heterogeneity among loci distributions. Humans present slightly 
      larger alleles than the rest of species but a more relevant difference appears in 
      variability levels: Humans are the species with the largest variance, although 
      only for the expanding loci, suggesting a relationship between variability levels 
      and expansion potential. The sequence analysis shows high levels of sequence 
      conservation among species, a lack of correspondence between interruption 
      patterns and variability levels, and signs of conservative selective pressure for 
      some of the STR loci. Only two loci (SCA1 and SCA8) show a human specific 
      distribution, with larger alleles than the rest of species. This could account, 
      at the same time, for a human-specific trait and a predisposition to disease 
      through expansion.

TI  - Molecular genetics of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia: mutation analysis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia genes and CAG/CTG repeat expansion detection in 225 
      Italian families.
PG  - 727-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, at present 
      associated with 22 loci (spinocerebellar ataxia [SCA] 1-SCA8, SCA10-SCA19, SCA21, 
      SCA22, fibroblast growth factor 14 [FGF14]-SCA, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy [DRPLA]). The relevant gene has been identified in 12 cases (SCA1-3, 
      SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, FGF14, and DRPLA), and in all but the recently identified 
      SCA14, SCA17, PRKCG and FGF14 genes, the defect consists of the expansion of a 
      short nucleotide repeat. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relative prevalence of 
      SCA1-3, SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, and SCA17 gene expansions in Italian families with 
      hereditary ataxia, specifically to verify the occurrence of SCA10, SCA12, and 
      SCA17 in Italy; and to analyze samples from probands with negative test results 
      at the initial screening by means of the repeat expansion detection technique to 
      identify CAG/CTG expansions in novel loci.Patients Two hundred twenty-five 
      unrelated Italian index cases with hereditary ataxia, most (n = 183) of whom 
      presented with a clear dominantly transmitted trait. RESULTS: We found that SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene mutations accounted for most cases (21% and 24%, respectively). We 
      found SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, and SCA17 to be very rare (approximately 1% each), 
      and no case of SCA10 or SCA12 was identified. Half of the index cases (113/225) 
      were negative for expansions in the known SCA genes. Repeat expansion detection 
      analysis performed on 111 of these cases showed a CAG/CTG repeat expansion of at 
      least 50 triplets in 22 (20%). Twenty-one of 22 expansions could be attributed to 
      length variation at 2 polymorphic loci (expanded repeat domain CAG/CTG 1 [ERDA1] 
      or CTG repeat on chromosome 18q21.1 [CTG18.1]). In 1 patient, the expansion was 
      assigned to the DRPLA gene. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of SCA1-3 and SCA6-7 
      gene mutations is peculiar in Italy. We found a relatively high frequency of SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene expansions; SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 mutations were rare, compared with 
      other European countries. No SCA10 or SCA12 and only a few SCA8 (2/225) and SCA17 
      (2/225) families were detected. In patients negative for defects in known SCA 
      genes, repeat expansion detection data strongly suggest that, at least in our 
      population, CAG/CTG expansions in novel genes should be considered an unlikely 
      cause of the SCA phenotype.

TI  - Analysis of trinucleotide repeats in different SCA loci in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      patients and in normal population of Taiwan.
PG  - 355-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) patients referred to our research 
      center, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD (Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, SCA8 and SCA12 
      loci were assessed for expansion of trinucleotide repeats. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      A total of 211 ADCA patients, including 202 patients with dominantly inherited 
      ataxia from 81 Taiwanese families and nine patients with sporadic ataxia, were 
      included in this study and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. 
      The amplified products of all loci were analyzed on both 3% agarose gels and 6% 
      denaturing urea-polyacrylamide gels. PCR-based Southern blots were also applied 
      for the detection of SCA7 locus. RESULTS: The SCA1 mutation was detected in six 
      affected individuals from one family (1.2%) with expanded alleles of 50-53 CAG 
      repeats. Fourteen individuals from nine families (11%) had a CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while affected SCA2 alleles have 34-49 CAG 
      repeats. The SCA3/MJD CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in 60 affected 
      individuals from 26 families (32%) was expanded to 71-85 CAG repeats. As for the 
      SCA7 locus, there were two affected individuals from one family (1.2%) possessed 
      41 and 100 CAG repeats, respectively. However, we did not detect expansion in the 
      SCA6, SCA8 and SCA12 loci in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The SCA3/MJD CAG expansion 
      was the most frequent mutation among the SCA patients. The relative prevalence of 
      SCA3/MJD in Taiwan was higher than that of SCA2, SCA1 and SCA7.

TI  - Haplotype study in Dutch SCA3 and SCA6 families: evidence for common founder 
      mutations.
PG  - 441-6
AB  - This pilot study was initiated to show the existence of founder effects in the 
      Dutch autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) population. The ADCAs comprise 
      a clinically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders and the estimated 
      prevalence in the Netherlands is approximately 3:100 000 individuals. Here, we 
      focused on the SCA3 and SCA6 genes because mutations in these genes occur most 
      frequently in the Netherlands. We were able to determine a common origin of the 
      CAG repeat expansions in the majority of Dutch SCA3 and SCA6 families. Haplotype 
      analysis and linkage disequilibrium studies with polymorphic markers revealed 
      shared haplotypes surrounding the SCA3 and SCA6 genes. These results strongly 
      suggest that ADCA families can be traced back to common ancestors in particular 
      parts of the Netherlands.

TI  - Possible reduced penetrance of expansion of 44 to 47 CAG/CAA repeats in the 
      TATA-binding protein gene in spinocerebellar ataxia type 17.
PG  - 209-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17) is an autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia caused by expansion of CAG/CAA trinucleotide repeats in the 
      TATA-binding protein (TBP) gene. Because the number of triplets in patients with 
      SCA17 in previous studies ranged from 43 to 63, the normal number of 
      trinucleotide units has been considered to be 42 or less. However, some healthy 
      subjects in SCA17 pedigrees carry alleles with the same number of expanded 
      repeats as patients with SCA17. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the minimum number of 
      CAG/CAA repeats in the TBP gene that causes SCA17. DESIGN: We amplified the 
      region of the TBP gene containing the CAG/CAA repeat by means of polymerase chain 
      reaction and performed fragment and sequence analyses. PATIENTS: The subjects 
      included 734 patients with SCA (480 patients with sporadic SCA and 254 patients 
      with familial SCA) without CAG repeat expansions at the SCA1, SCA2, 
      Machado-Joseph disease, SCA6, SCA7, or dentatorubral-pallidolluysian atrophy 
      loci, with 162 healthy subjects, 216 patients with Parkinson disease, and 195 
      with Alzheimer disease as control subjects. RESULTS: Eight patients with SCA 
      possessed an allele with more than 43 CAG/CAA repeats. Among the non-SCA groups, 
      alleles with 43 to 45 repeats were seen in 3 healthy subjects and 2 with 
      Parkinson disease. In 1 SCA pedigree, a patient with possible SCA17 and her 
      healthy sister had alleles with 45 repeats. A 34-year-old man carrying alleles 
      with 47 and 44 repeats (47/44) had developed progressive cerebellar ataxia and 
      myoclonus at 25 years of age, and he exhibited dementia and pyramidal signs. He 
      was the only affected person in his pedigree, although his father and mother 
      carried alleles with mildly expanded repeats (44/36 and 47/36, respectively). In 
      another pedigree, 1 patient carried a 43-repeat allele, whereas another patient 
      had 2 normal alleles, indicating that the 43-repeat allele may not be pathologic 
      in this family. CONCLUSIONS: We estimate that 44 CAG/CAA repeats is the minimum 
      number required to cause SCA17. However, the existence of unaffected subjects 
      with mildly expanded triplets suggests that the TBP gene mutation may not 
      penetrate fully. Homozygosity of alleles with mildly expanded triplet repeats in 
      the TBP gene might contribute to the pathologic phenotype.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia: SCA2 is the most frequent mutation in 
      eastern India.
PG  - 448-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) has been reported as the 
      commonest dominant hereditary ataxia in India. However, India is an ethnically 
      and religiously diverse population. Previous studies have not clearly indicated 
      exact ethnic and religious origins, and must therefore be interpreted with 
      caution. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of different 
      SCA mutations in a relatively homogeneous population from eastern India. METHODS: 
      We identified 28 families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia from eastern 
      India. Each underwent full clinical evaluation and were analysed for the presence 
      of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, and SCA17 mutations. In addition, 
      haplotype analysis was carried out in seven of the 16 families with SCA2. 
      RESULTS: Seven patients from four (14%) families were positive for an expansion 
      in SCA1 and 26 patients from 16 (57%) families were positive for an expansion in 
      SCA2. No mutations were detected in the remaining eight families (29%). Most of 
      the SCA1 and SCA2 families were Hindu from the state of Bihar. Five out of 26 
      SCA2 patients in this study did not have slow saccades. In addition, four of 
      seven SCA1 patients had slow saccades. We found an association between the SCA2 
      CAG repeat expansion and the 285 base pair (bp) allele of microsatellite marker 
      D12S1672, and also data supportive of the association between the expansion and 
      the 225 bp allele of D12S1333, which has been previously described. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We conclude that (1) although slow ocular saccades are highly suggestive of SCA2, 
      that they are not universal, nor are they exclusive to this disorder and (2) SCA2 
      is likely to be the commonest dominant ataxia in eastern India, with further 
      evidence for a founder effect.

TI  - Genetic testing in spinocerebellar ataxia in Taiwan: expansions of trinucleotide 
      repeats in SCA8 and SCA17 are associated with typical Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 209-14
AB  - DNA tests in normal subjects and patients with ataxia and Parkinson's disease 
      (PD) were carried out to assess the frequency of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) and 
      to document the distribution of SCA mutations underlying ethnic Chinese in 
      Taiwan. MJD/SCA3 (46%) was the most common autosomal dominant SCA in the 
      Taiwanese cohort, followed by SCA6 (18%) and SCA1 (3%). No expansions of SCA 
      types 2, 10, 12, or dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) were detected. The 
      clinical phenotypes of these affected SCA patients were very heterogeneous. All 
      of them showed clinical symptoms of cerebellar ataxia, with or without other 
      associated features. The frequencies of large normal alleles are closely 
      associated with the prevalence of SCA1, SCA2, MJD/SCA3, SCA6, and DRPLA among 
      Taiwanese, Japanese, and Caucasians. Interestingly, abnormal expansions of SCA8 
      and SCA17 genes were detected in patients with PD. The clinical presentation for 
      these patients is typical of idiopathic PD with the following characteristics: 
      late onset of disease, resting tremor in the limbs, rigidity, bradykinesia, and a 
      good response to levodopa. This study appears to be the first report describing 
      the PD phenotype in association with an expanded allele in the TATA-binding 
      protein gene and suggests that SCA8 may also be a cause of typical PD.

      type 6.
PG  - 1201-4
AB  - We report on a family with ataxia type 6 (SCA6) showing peculiar oculomotor 
      symptoms. The proband presented with periodic alternating nystagmus (PAN), and 
      her 2 brothers had rebound nystagmus and gaze-evoked nystagmus. They carried the 
      identical mutation (the number of expanded CAG repeat, 24) in the CACNA1A gene. 
      The intrafamilial variability of oculomotor symptoms may be ascribed to factors 
      other than CAG repeat expansion size in SCA6.

TI  - Frequency analysis and clinical characterization of spinocerebellar ataxia types 
      1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 in Korean patients.
PG  - 858-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: By genetic analysis, the CAG repeat expansion has been established in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. Despite the genetic 
      differentiation of SCA, the characterization of the phenotypes of various SCAs 
      has been challenging for better clinical diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the 
      frequencies and the clinical manifestations of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 
      in Korean patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed genetic analysis in 253 
      unrelated Korean patients with progressive cerebellar ataxia. We compared the 
      frequencies, inheritance patterns, and various clinical manifestations of 
      patients with genetically confirmed SCA. RESULTS: Among the 52 patients with 
      expanded CAG repeat, the most frequent SCA type was SCA2, followed by SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA1, and SCA7. Nine patients (17%) had a negative family history of ataxia, 
      mostly in SCA6. There were characteristic clinical features such as hypotonia and 
      optic atrophy for SCA1; hyporeflexia for SCA2; nystagmus, bulging eye, and 
      dystonia for SCA3; and macular degeneration for SCA7. Interestingly, 4 patients 
      (1 with SCA2, 1 with SCA3, and 2 with SCA6) were misdiagnosed as having 
      multiple-system atrophy because of the absence of family history and the presence 
      of parkinsonism and urinary incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a 
      detailed analysis of the clinical characteristics of the genetically defined 
      CAG-repeat SCAs in Korean patients. Although phenotypes were heterogeneous, some 
      clinical features may be helpful for clinical diagnosis. However, genetic studies 
      for SCA are needed despite uncertain family history or the presence of atypical 
      clinical features causing misdiagnosis as atypical parkinsonism.

TI  - A novel autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA22) linked to chromosome 
      1p21-q23.
PG  - 1293-9
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically, pathologically 
      and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. Ten responsible genes have been 
      identified for spinocerebellar ataxia types SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, 
      SCA10, SCA12 and SCA17, and dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      mutation is caused by an expansion of a CAG, CTG or ATTCT repeat sequence of 
      these genes. Six additional loci, SCA4, SCA5, SCA11, SCA13, SCA14 and SCA16 have 
      also been mapped. The growing heterogeneity of the autosomal dominant forms of 
      these diseases shows that the genetic aetiologies of at least 20% of ADCA have 
      yet to be elucidated. We ascertained and clinically characterized a 
      four-generation Chinese pedigree segregating an autosomal dominant phenotype for 
      cerebellar ataxia. Direct mutation analysis, linkage analysis for all known SCA 
      loci and a genome-wide linkage study were performed. Direct mutation analysis 
      excluded SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17 and DRPLA, and genetic linkage analysis 
      excluded SCA4, 5, 11, 13, 14 and 16. The genome-wide linkage study suggested 
      linkage to a locus on chromosome 1p21-q23, with the highest two-point LOD score 
      at D1S1167 (Zmax = 3.46 at theta = 0.00). Multipoint analysis and haplotype 
      reconstruction traced this novel SCA locus (SCA22) to a 43.7-cM interval flanked 
      by D1S206 and D1S2878 (Zmax = 3.78 under four liability classes, and 2.67 using 
      affected-only method). The age at onset ranged from 10 to 46 years. All affected 
      members had gait ataxia with variable features of dysarthria and hyporeflexia. 
      Head MRI showed homogeneous atrophy of the cerebellum without involvement of the 
      brainstem. In six parent-child pairs, median onset occurred 10 years earlier in 
      offspring than in their parents, suggesting anticipation. This family is distinct 
      from other families with SCA and is characterized by a slowly progressive, pure 
      cerebellar ataxia.

TI  - Proteolytic cleavage and cellular toxicity of the human alpha1A calcium channel 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 74-8
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by 
      small CAG repeat expansion in the alpha1A calcium channel gene. We found that the 
      human alpha1A calcium channel protein expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T 
      cells produces a 75 kDa C-terminal fragment. This fragment is more toxic to cells 
      than the full-length alpha1A calcium channel, regardless of polyglutamine tract 
      length. In cells stably transfected with plasmids of full-length alpha1A calcium 
      channel cDNAs, the C-terminal fragment protein is present in the mutant 
      transformant but not in the wild-type one, indicative that this C-terminal 
      fragment with the expanded polyglutamine tract is more resistant to proteolysis 
      than that with the normal sized polyglutamine tract. We speculate that the toxic 
      C-terminal fragment, in which resistance to proteolysis is rendered by the 
      expanded polyglutamine, has a key role in the pathological mechanism of SCA6.

TI  - Searching for modulating effects of SCA2, SCA6 and DRPLA CAG tracts on the 
      Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3) phenotype.
PG  - 211-4
AB  - CONTEXT: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD/SCA3) is an autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia of adult onset. The variability in age at onset and the complex and 
      heterogeneous neurologic findings indicate that MJD, caused by a major gene, is 
      modulated by modifier factors. OBJECTIVE: To study if the polymorphic CAG repeats 
      at other loci (namely, SCA2, SCA6 and DRPLA) thus acted as modifier factors of 
      this disease. DESIGN: Case-control. SETTING: Ambulatory care in a referral 
      center. PATIENTS: A convenience sample of 39 unrelated, Brazilian patients with 
      MJD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: age of onset, anticipation, clinical subtypes and 
      neurological findings. RESULTS: Fasciculations were associated with CAG repeat 
      length of the long SCA2 allele (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.03, after Bonferroni 
      procedure). Other measures (age of onset, anticipation, clinical types and other 
      neurological signs) were not associated with CAG repeat length of SCA2, SCA6 and 
      DRPLA genes. CONCLUSIONS: The present results show that the CAG tract of SCA2 
      gene interferes with MJD phenotype. Further studies, with patients of other 
      origins and with typing of other (CAG)n loci, are necessary.

TI  - SCA8 repeat expansion: large CTA/CTG repeat alleles are more common in ataxic 
      patients, including those with SCA6.
PG  - 704-9
AB  - We analyzed the SCA8 CTA/CTG repeat in a large group of Japanese subjects. The 
      frequency of large alleles (85-399 CTA/CTG repeats) was 1.9% in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA), 0.4% in Parkinson disease, 0.3% in Alzheimer disease, and 0% in a 
      healthy control group; the frequency was significantly higher in the group with 
      SCA than in the control group. Homozygotes for large alleles were observed only 
      in the group with SCA. In five patients with SCA from two families, a large SCA8 
      CTA/CTG repeat and a large SCA6 CAG repeat coexisted. Age at onset was correlated 
      with SCA8 repeats rather than SCA6 repeats in these five patients. In one of 
      these families, at least one patient showed only a large SCA8 CTA/CTG repeat 
      allele, with no large SCA6 CAG repeat allele. We speculate that the presence of a 
      large SCA8 CTA/CTG repeat allele influences the function of channels such as 
      alpha(1A)-voltage-dependent calcium channel through changing or aberrant 
      splicing, resulting in the development of cerebellar ataxia, especially in 
      homozygous patients.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeats in 202 families with ataxia: a small expanded (CAG)n allele 
      at the SCA17 locus.
PG  - 623-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ten neurodegenerative disorders characterized by spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) are known to be caused by trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansions. 
      However, in some instances the molecular diagnosis is considered indeterminate 
      because of the overlap between normal and affected allele ranges. In addition, 
      the mechanism that generates expanded alleles is not completely understood. 
      OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical and molecular characteristics of a large group 
      of Portuguese and Brazilian families with ataxia to improve knowledge of the 
      molecular diagnosis of SCA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have (1) assessed repeat 
      sizes at all known TNR loci implicated in SCA; (2) determined frequency 
      distributions of normal alleles and expansions; and (3) looked at 
      genotype-phenotype correlations in 202 unrelated Portuguese and Brazilian 
      patients with SCA. Molecular analysis of TNR expansions was performed using 
      polymerase chain reaction amplification. RESULTS: Patients from 110 unrelated 
      families with SCA showed TNR expansions at 1 of the loci studied. Dominantly 
      transmitted cases had (CAG)(n) expansions at the Machado-Joseph disease gene 
      (MJD1) (63%), at SCA2 (3%), the gene for dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) (2%), SCA6 (1%), or SCA7 (1%) loci, or (CTG)(n) expansions at the SCA8 
      (2%) gene, whereas (GAA)(n) expansions in the Freidreich ataxia gene (FRDA) were 
      found in 64% of families with recessive ataxia. Isolated patients also had TNR 
      expansions at the MJD1 (6%), SCA8 (6%), or FRDA (8%) genes; in addition, an 
      expanded allele at the TATA-binding protein gene (TBP), with 43 CAGs, was present 
      in a patient with ataxia and mental deterioration. Associations between 
      frequencies of SCA2 and SCA6 and a frequency of large normal alleles were found 
      in Portuguese and Brazilian individuals, respectively. Interestingly, no 
      association between the frequencies of DRPLA and large normal alleles was found 
      in the Portuguese group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that (1) a significant 
      number of isolated cases of ataxia are due to TNR expansions; (2) expanded DRPLA 
      alleles in Portuguese families may have evolved from an ancestral haplotype; and 
      (3) small (CAG)(n) expansions at the TBP gene may cause SCA17.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias in the Netherlands: prevalence and age at onset variance 
      analysis.
PG  - 702-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: International prevalence estimates of autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxias (ADCA) vary from 0.3 to 2.0 per 100,000. The prevalence of ADCA in the 
      Netherlands is unknown. Fifteen genetic loci have been identified (SCA-1-8, 
      SCA-10-14, SCA-16, and SCA-17) and nine of the corresponding genes have been 
      cloned. In SCA-1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA-12 and SCA-17 the mutation has been 
      shown to be an expanded CAG repeat. Previously, the length of the CAG repeat was 
      found to account for 50 to 80% of variance in age at onset. Because of 
      heterogeneity in encoded proteins, different pathophysiologic mechanisms leading 
      to neurodegeneration could be involved. The relationship between CAG repeat 
      length and age at onset would then differ accordingly. METHOD: Based on the 
      results of SCA mutation analysis in the three DNA diagnostic laboratories that 
      serve the entire Dutch population, the authors surveyed the number of families 
      and affected individuals per SCA gene, as well as individual repeat length and 
      age at onset. Regression analysis was applied to study the relationship between 
      CAG repeat length and age at onset per SCA gene. The slopes of the different 
      regression curves were compared. RESULTS: On November 1, 2000, mutations were 
      found in 145 ADCA families and 391 affected individuals were identified. The 
      authors extrapolated a minimal prevalence of 3.0 per 100,000 (range 2.8 to 
      3.8/100,000). SCA3 was the most frequent mutation. CAG repeat length contributed 
      to 52 to 76% of age at onset variance. Regression curve slopes for SCA-1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, and SCA7 did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated minimal 
      prevalence of ADCA in the Netherlands is 3.0 per 100,000 inhabitants. Except for 
      SCA6, the relationship between age at onset and CAG repeat expansion does not 
      differ significantly between SCA-1, SCA2, SCA3, and SCA7 patient groups in our 
      population, indicating that these SCA subtypes share similar mechanisms of 
      polyglutamine-induced neurotoxicity, despite heterogeneity in gene products.

TI  - Spastic paraplegia, ataxia, mental retardation (SPAR): a novel genetic disorder.
PG  - 411-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a kindred with a dominantly inherited neurologic disorder 
      manifested either as uncomplicated spastic paraplegia or ataxia, spastic 
      paraplegia, and mental retardation. METHODS: Neurologic examinations and 
      molecular genetic analysis (exclusion of known SCA and HSP genes and loci; and 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion detection [RED]) were performed in six affected 
      and four unaffected subjects in this family. MRI, electromyography (EMG), and 
      nerve conduction studies were performed in three affected subjects. RESULTS: The 
      phenotype of this dominantly inherited syndrome varied in succeeding generations. 
      Pure spastic paraplegia was present in the earliest generation; subsequent 
      generations had ataxia and mental retardation. MRI showed marked atrophy of the 
      spinal cord in all patients and cerebellar atrophy in those with ataxia. 
      Laboratory analysis showed that the disorder was not caused by mutations in genes 
      that cause SCA-1, SCA-2, SCA-3, SCA-6, SCA-7, SCA-8, and SCA-12; not linked to 
      other known loci for autosomal dominant ataxia (SCA-4, SCA-5, SCA-10, SCA-11, 
      SCA-13, SCA-14, and SCA-16); and not linked to known loci for autosomal dominant 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (SPG-3, SPG-4, SPG-6, SPG-8, SPG-9, SPG-10, 
      SPG-12, and SPG-13) or autosomal recessive HSP SPG-7. Analysis of 
      intergenerational differences in age at onset of symptoms suggests genetic 
      anticipation. Using RED, the authors did not detect expanded CAG, CCT, TGG, or 
      CGT repeats that segregate with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The authors describe an 
      unusual, dominantly inherited neurologic disorder in which the phenotype (pure 
      spastic paraplegia or spastic ataxia with variable mental retardation) differed 
      in subsequent generations. The molecular explanation for apparent genetic 
      anticipation does not appear to involve trinucleotide repeat expansion.

TI  - Molecular analysis of Spinocerebellar ataxias in Koreans: frequencies and 
      reference ranges of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7.
PG  - 336-41
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. CAG repeat expansions in the causative genes have been identified as 
      the basic cause of several types of SCAs, and have been used for the diagnoses 
      and classifications of patients with ataxia. In order to assess the frequency and 
      CAG repeat size ranges of SCAs, and to establish an effective strategy for 
      molecular diagnosis, we performed a molecular analysis of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      and SCA7 in 76 patients. These patients were as follows: 32 with dominant 
      inheritance, 39 sporadic cases, and 5 with unknown family histories. The normal 
      and affected CAG repeat size ranges were established at five SCA loci in Koreans, 
      which was consistent with previous reports. The total prevalence of the five 
      types of SCAs was 39.5% in the 76 patients with ataxia, regardless of their 
      family history. It was 75.0% in the 32 families with a dominant inheritance. The 
      most frequent type was SCA3 (15.8%), followed by SCA2 (14.5%). Both types 
      combined formed 76.7% of the 30 patients with CAG expansions. SCA1, SCA6, and 
      SCA7 were less frequent, affecting 3.9%, 2.6%, and 2.6% of the cases, 
      respectively. This mutation spectrum is quite different from a previous report 
      concerning Koreans, but is similar to the distributions that are seen in several 
      ethnic populations worldwide. For a correct and effective diagnosis of SCAs, we 
      suggest that a molecular diagnosis be undertaken, even in patients without a 
      family history, as well as those with a family history. A stepwise approach is 
      also recommended. Patients with ataxia should be tested for SCA2 and SCA3. 
      Individuals testing negative should be tested for SCA1, SCA6, and SCA7.

TI  - Increased expression of alpha 1A Ca2+ channel currents arising from expanded 
      trinucleotide repeats in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 9185-93
AB  - The expansion of polyglutamine tracts encoded by CAG trinucleotide repeats is a 
      common mutational mechanism in inherited neurodegenerative diseases. 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), an autosomal dominant, progressive disease, 
      arises from trinucleotide repeat expansions present in the coding region of 
      CACNA1A (chromosome 19p13). This gene encodes alpha(1A), the principal subunit of 
      P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels, which are abundant in the CNS, particularly in 
      cerebellar Purkinje and granule neurons. We assayed ion channel function by 
      introduction of human alpha(1A) cDNAs in human embryonic kidney 293 cells that 
      stably coexpressed beta(1) and alpha(2)delta subunits. Immunocytochemical 
      analysis showed a rise in intracellular and surface expression of alpha(1A) 
      protein when CAG repeat lengths reached or exceeded the pathogenic range for 
      SCA6. This gain at the protein level was not a consequence of changes in RNA 
      stability, as indicated by Northern blot analysis. The electrophysiological 
      behavior of alpha(1A) subunits containing expanded (EXP) numbers of CAG repeats 
      (23, 27, and 72) was compared against that of wild-type subunits (WT) (4 and 11 
      repeats) using standard whole-cell patch-clamp recording conditions. The EXP 
      alpha(1A) subunits yielded functional ion channels that supported inward Ca(2+) 
      channel currents, with a sharp increase in P/Q Ca(2+) channel current density 
      relative to WT. Our results showed that Ca(2+) channels from SCA6 patients 
      display near-normal biophysical properties but increased current density 
      attributable to elevated protein expression at the cell surface.

TI  - Clinical and molecular correlations in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6: a study of 
      24 Dutch families.
PG  - 1839-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs), or spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCAs), are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders. Mild 
      CAG repeat expansions in the alpha(1A) voltage-dependent calcium channel gene are 
      associated with SCA type 6 (SCA6). OBJECTIVE: To obtain further insight into the 
      contribution of SCA6 mutations to the phenotypic variability in Dutch patients 
      with ataxia. DESIGN: Survey and case series. SETTING: Hospitalized care, referral 
      center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The SCA6 locus was analyzed for CAG repeat 
      expansions in a referred sample of 220 Dutch families with progressive cerebellar 
      ataxia. Clinical characteristics of patients with SCA6 were investigated and 
      correlated with molecular findings. RESULTS: The diagnosis SCA6 was confirmed in 
      24 families comprising 30 familial and 4 sporadic cases. Mean +/- SD age at onset 
      was 50.1 +/- 11.1 years. Expanded CAG repeats with sizes 22, 23, and 25 were 
      found. These sizes correlated inversely with age at onset. No intergenerational 
      changes in CAG repeat size were detected. Despite this, 2 families showed 
      clinical anticipation. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first detailed 
      description of Dutch patients with SCA6. Clinical analysis identifies SCA6 as a 
      late-onset ataxia in which eye movement abnormalities are prominent and 
      consistent early manifestations. No single clinical sign can be considered 
      specific for SCA6. Some patients have ataxia combined with episodic headaches or 
      nausea, suggesting an overlap among SCA6, eposidic ataxia type 2, and familial 
      hemiplegic migraine. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 accounts for approximately 11% 
      of all Dutch families with ADCA. Analysis of SCA6 contributes further to the 
      genetic classification of patients with ADCA, including patients without a clear 
      family history of the disease.

TI  - Frequency analysis of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias in Taiwanese patients 
      and clinical and molecular characterization of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 1105-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders. The mutational basis for most of these disorders is 
      an expanded CAG repeat sequence within the coding regions of the genes involved. 
      The prevalence of SCA in the ethnic Chinese on Taiwan remains unclear. Moreover, 
      there has been no report of SCA type 6 (SCA6) among Chinese people. OBJECTIVES: 
      To characterize the prevalence of SCA in the ethnic Chinese on Taiwan, and to 
      specifically characterize Chinese patients with SCA6 in terms of clinical and 
      molecular features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a molecular approach, we 
      investigated SCA in 74 Taiwanese families with dominantly inherited ataxias and 
      in 49 Taiwanese patients with sporadic ataxias. Clinical and molecular features 
      of SCA6 were further characterized in 12 patients from 8 families and in 2 
      sporadic cases. Furthermore, the intragenic polymorphic marker D19S1150 was 
      amplified by polymerase chain reaction to analyze for linkage disequilibrium. 
      RESULTS: Machado-Joseph disease-SCA3 was the most common type of autosomal 
      dominant SCA in the Taiwanese cohort, accounting for 35 cases (47.3%), followed 
      by SCA6 (8 [10.8%]), SCA2 (8 [10.8%]), SCA1 (4 [5.4%]), SCA7 (2 [2.7%]), 
      dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (1 [1.4%]), and SCA8 (0%). The genes 
      responsible for 16 (21.6%) of Taiwanese dominantly inherited SCA cases remain to 
      be determined. Among the 49 patients with sporadic ataxias in the present series, 
      2 (4.1%) were found to harbor SCA6 mutations. In the families with SCA6, we found 
      significant anticipation in the absence of genetic instability on transmission, 
      indicating that some other mechanism might account for the anticipation. The same 
      frequent allele of the intragenic DNA marker (D19S1150) was shared by 7 of 10 
      Taiwanese families with SCA6. CONCLUSIONS: Although SCA6 has, so far, not been 
      reported in mainland Chinese, we found a geographic cluster of families with SCA6 
      on Taiwan. Genotyping studies suggest a founder effect in the Taiwanese patients 
      with SCA6.

TI  - Sporadic late onset paroxysmal cerebellar ataxia in four unrelated patients: a 
      new disease?
PG  - 209-14
AB  - We describe a peculiar form of late onset paroxysmal cerebellar ataxia including 
      clinical features similar to episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) but unresponsive to 
      acetazolamide. Four unrelated patients were clinically investigated. 
      Neuropathological examination was performed in one patient and molecular analysis 
      in all four. All 47 exons of CACNA1A were screened by a combination of 
      single-strand conformer polymorphism and sequencing analysis in three patients. 
      In addition, the length of the CAG repeat was determined in all four patients. 
      The four patients were in their 60s at the onset of the disease, which was 
      characterized by cerebellar ataxia attacks lasting from a few minutes to 1-2 h 
      and occurring mainly in the morning. In the interictal period a nystagmus was 
      present together with a slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia over the years. The 
      neuropathological examination disclosed a dramatic loss of Purkinje cells mainly 
      in the vermis. Moreover, certain cerebellar granular neurons had a strong 
      cytoplasmic staining at immunopathological examination with an anti-tau protein 
      serum. Search for truncating mutations or CAG repeat expansion in CACNA1A was 
      negative. This late-onset paroxysmal cerebellar ataxia with neuropathological 
      lesions restricted to Purkinje cells and with negative results both for 
      truncating mutations and CAG expansion in the CACNA1A gene represents a new 
      entity. Further studies are needed to delineate the underlying process.

TI  - No evidence of association between CAG expansions and essential tremor in a large 
      cohort of Italian patients.
PG  - 297-304
AB  - Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common movement disorders. However the 
      pathogenesis is as yet unknown, although a genetic cause has long been 
      recognised. Clinical and molecular evidences suggested that the ET gene might 
      contain a CAG expanded region. In a cohort of Italian ET patients Repeat 
      Expansion Detection (RED) approach did not demonstrate large CAG expansions. We 
      extended the study towards specific targets: the channel proteins hSKCa3 and 
      CACNL1A4. Direct assessment of CAG stretches within these two genes did not 
      demonstrate any CAG expansion in affected subjects. Also a case-control analysis 
      failed to reveal any evidence of association, thus excluding these genes as a 
      cause of ET.

TI  - Meiotic instability of the CAG repeats in the SCA6/CACNA1A gene in two Japanese 
      SCA6 families.
PG  - 101-7
AB  - Intergenerational stability of the CAG repeat number has been considered to be a 
      specific molecular feature of SCA6 compared with other CAG repeat diseases. 
      Nevertheless, we showed meiotic instability of the CAG repeats in the 
      SCA6/CACNL1A gene in two Japanese SCA6 families, including de novo expansion. In 
      one family, the CAG20 allele expanded to the CAG26 one during paternal 
      transmission, and in the other family, the CAG19 allele expanded to the CAG20 one 
      during maternal transmission. Although it is controversial as to whether the 
      CAG20 allele is pathological or not, this is the first case of haplotype 
      analysis-proven de novo expansion in SCA6, confirming the derivation of an 
      expanded allele from one normal allele. We should carefully follow up the 
      individuals carrying the CAG20 allele in our family who show normal neurological 
      and radiological findings at present.

TI  - Metabolic characterization of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 300-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by slowly progressive ataxia and dysarthria. The mutational basis 
      is an expanded CAG repeat sequence within the coding regions of the CACNL1A4 
      gene. Basic clinical, neuroimaging, and pathological, and epidemiological 
      features have been described in the literature. However, the metabolic features 
      of SCA6 have not been elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the metabolic 
      features of SCA6. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven patients with SCA6 and 7 healthy 
      individuals underwent positron emission tomography using fluorodeoxyglucose F 18. 
      RESULTS: Cerebral glucose utilization in the 7 patients with SCA6 was 
      characterized by significant hypometabolism in widespread structures, including 
      cortical regions and basal ganglia, as well as the cerebellar hemispheres and 
      brainstem. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the multiple-regional brain hypometabolism 
      suggest that brain dysfunction associated with SCA6 may not be limited to the 
      cerebellum and inferior olive, as previously suggested by the results of other 
      pathologic studies.

TI  - Clinical features and genetic analysis of a new form of spinocerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 234-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically 
      heterogeneous group of disorders. The mutations for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, and SCA-12 are identified and caused by an expansion of a CAG or a CTG 
      repeat sequence of these genes. Six additional loci for SCA4, SCA5, SCA-10, 
      SCA-11, SCA-13, and SCA-14 are mapped. The growing heterogeneity of the autosomal 
      dominant forms of these diseases shows that the genetic etiologies of at least 
      20% of ADCA have yet to be elucidated. METHODS: The authors ascertained and 
      clinically characterized a four-generation pedigree segregating an autosomal 
      dominant phenotype for SCA. Direct mutation analysis, repeat expansion detection 
      analysis, and linkage analysis for all known SCA loci were performed. RESULTS: 
      Direct mutational analysis excluded SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 12; genetic linkage 
      analysis excluded SCA4, 5,10, 11, 13, and 14, giving significant negative lod 
      scores. Examination of the family showed that all affected members had gait 
      ataxia and akinesia with variable features of dysarthria, hyporeflexia, and mild 
      intellectual impairment. Eye movements were normal. Head MRI showed atrophy of 
      the cerebellum without involvement of the brainstem. In 10 parent-child pairs, 
      median onset occurred 10.5 years earlier in offspring than in their parents, 
      suggesting anticipation. CONCLUSION: This family is distinct from other families 
      with SCA and is characterized by cerebellar ataxia and extrapyramidal signs.

TI  - Evidence that allelic variants of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 gene 
      influence susceptibility to multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 91-6
AB  - Expanded CAG trinucleotide repeats are known to be responsible for five of the 
      autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7). We 
      have typed each of these repeats in 226 multiple sclerosis sibling pair families. 
      No expanded repeats were seen, indicating an absence of SCA phenocopies in 
      clinically defined familial multiple sclerosis. However, transmission 
      disequilibrium testing for these repeats demonstrated significant excess 
      transmission of the 22 repeat length allele of the SCA2 gene (P=4. 4E-06) in 
      multiple sclerosis patients. This observation is consistent with pleiotropic 
      effects of the SCA2 gene, with a non-dynamic mutation/polymorphism contributing 
      epistatically to susceptibility in multiple sclerosis.

TI  - Genetic background of apparently idiopathic sporadic cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 132-7
AB  - Disease-causing mutations have been identified in various entities of autosomal 
      dominant ataxia and in Friedreich's ataxia. However, no molecular pathogenic 
      factor is known to cause idiopathic cerebellar ataxias. We investigated the 
      CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats causing spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 
      8 and 12, and the GAA repeat of the frataxin gene in 124 patients apparently 
      suffering from idiopathic sporadic ataxia, including 20 patients with the 
      clinical diagnosis of multiple system atrophy. Patients with a positive family 
      history, a typical Friedreich phenotype, or symptomatic ataxia were excluded. 
      Genetic analyses uncovered the most common Friedreich mutation in 10 patients 
      with an age at onset between 13 and 36 years. The SCA6 mutation was present in 
      nine patients with disease onset between 47 and 68 years of age. The CTG repeat 
      associated with SCA8 was expanded in three patients. One patient had SCA2 
      attributable to a de novo mutation from a paternally transmitted, intermediate 
      allele. We did not identify the SCA1, SCA3, SCA7 or SCA12 mutation in idiopathic 
      sporadic ataxia patients. No trinucleotide repeat expansion was detected in the 
      MSA subgroup. This study has revealed the genetic basis in 19% of apparently 
      idiopathic ataxia patients. SCA6 is the most frequent mutation in late onset 
      cerebellar ataxia. The frataxin trinucleotide expansion should be investigated in 
      all sporadic ataxia patients with onset before age 40, even when the phenotype is 
      atypical for Friedreich's ataxia.

TI  - Morphological Purkinje cell changes in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 371-6
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) was recently identified as a form of 
      autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia associated with a small CAG repeat 
      expansion of the gene encoding an alpha 1 A-voltage-dependent calcium channel 
      gene subunit on chromosome 19p13. In this study 50-microm-thick sections of 
      cerebellar tissue from one patient with SCA6 were subjected to free-floating 
      immunohistochemical staining with calbindin-D and parvalbumin antibodies. Severe 
      loss of Purkinje cells was found, particularly in the vermis, and various 
      morphological changes in Purkinje cells and their dendritic arborizations were 
      demonstrated. Many of the remaining Purkinje cells were found to have 
      heterotopic, irregularly shaped nuclei, an unclear cytoplasmic membrane outline, 
      and somatic sprouts. Increased numbers of spine-like protrusions from swelling 
      dendritic arborizations were found in the molecular layer. The axonal arrangement 
      was disordered, and many torpedos were found in the granular layer and white 
      matters. These morphological changes are completely different from those observed 
      in paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) 
      and are considered to be related to the genetic abnormality that causes abnormal 
      development of Purkinje cells.

TI  - The polyglutamine expansion in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 causes a beta 
      subunit-specific enhanced activation of P/Q-type calcium channels in Xenopus 
      oocytes.
PG  - 6394-403
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a dominantly inherited degenerative 
      disorder of the cerebellum characterized by nearly selective and progressive 
      death of Purkinje cells. The underlying mutation in SCA6 consists of an expansion 
      of a trinucleotide CAG repeat in the 3' region of the gene, CACNA1A, encoding the 
      alpha(1A) subunit of the neuronal P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel. 
      Although it is known that this mutation results in an expanded tract of glutamine 
      residues in some alpha(1A) splice forms, the distribution of these splice forms 
      and the role of this mutation in the highly selective Purkinje cell degeneration 
      seen in SCA6 have yet to be elucidated. Using specific antisera we demonstrate 
      that the pathological expansion in SCA6 can potentially be expressed in multiple 
      isoforms of the alpha(1A) subunit, and that these isoforms are abundantly 
      expressed in the cerebellum, particularly in the Purkinje cell bodies and 
      dendrites. Using alpha(1A) subunit chimeras expressing SCA6 mutations, we show 
      that the SCA6 polyglutamine expansion shifts the voltage dependence of channel 
      activation and rate of inactivation only when expressed with beta(4) subunits and 
      impairs normal G-protein regulation of P/Q channels. These findings suggest the 
      possibility that SCA6 is a channelopathy, and that the underlying mutation in 
      SCA6 causes Purkinje cell degeneration through excessive entry of calcium ions.

TI  - Sisters homozygous for the spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6)/CACNA1A gene 
      associated with different clinical phenotypes.
PG  - 69-73
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a 
      CAG repeat expansion in the CACNA1A gene. The neurodegeneration that occurs in 
      CAG repeat diseases is considered to share a common mechanism that may result in 
      the gain of a toxic function related to the expanded polyglutamine tracts. 
      However, the phenotypic expression in homozygotes for CAG repeat diseases has 
      been controversial, and is not clearly related to a gain of functional mechanism. 
      We identified a Japanese family with two sisters who were homozygous for the SCA6 
      with identical CAG repeat expansion (25/25). They showed an earlier age of onset 
      (27 years in both) than their father (44 years), a heterozygote with an expanded 
      allele showing the same CAG repeat length as the homozygotes (25/14). 
      Interestingly, the two sisters showed differences in disease progression and 
      severity, although the age of onset and CAG repeat length were identical. These 
      findings strongly suggest that the gene dosage influences the age of onset, but 
      other unknown factors are also important in the phenotypic expression of 
      homozygous SCA6.

TI  - Analysis of CAG repeats in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia patients and distribution of CAG repeats at the SCA1, SCA2 
      and SCA6 loci in nine ethnic populations of eastern India.
PG  - 597-604
AB  - To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 57 unrelated 
      individuals clinically diagnosed as ataxia patients we analysed the SCA1, SCA2, 
      SCA3, SCA6, SCA7 and DRPLA loci for expansion of CAG repeats. We detected CAG 
      repeat expansion in 6 patients (10.5%) at the SCA1 locus. Ten of the 57 patients 
      (17.5%) had CAG repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while four had CAG expansion 
      at the SCA3/MJD locus (7%). At the SCA6 locus there was a single patient (1.8%) 
      with 21 CAG repeats. We have not detected any patient with expansion in the SCA7 
      and DRPLA loci. To test whether the frequencies of the large normal alleles in 
      SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6 loci can reflect some light on prevalence of the subtypes of 
      SCAs we studied the CAG repeat variation in these loci in nine ethnic 
      sub-populations of eastern India from which the patients originated. We report 
      here that the frequency of large normal alleles (>31 CAG repeats) in SCA1 locus 
      to be 0.211 of 394 chromosomes studied. We also report that the frequency of 
      large normal alleles (>22 CAG repeats) at the SCA2 locus is 0.038 while at the 
      SCA6 locus frequency of large normal alleles (>13 repeats) is 0.032. We discussed 
      our data in light of the distribution of normal alleles and prevalence of SCAs in 
      the Japanese and white populations.

PG  - 31-6
AB  - Two hundred and forty-eight patients from 116 Italian families with dominant 
      ataxia were studied for CAG expansion within SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 (spinocerebellar 
      ataxia) and DRPLA (dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy) genes. Fifty-six percent 
      of the families originated from Southern, 19% from Central and 25% from Northern 
      Italy. SCA2 was the commonest mutation, accounting for 47% of the families, 
      followed by SCA1 (24%), SCA6 (2%), SCA7 (2%) and DRPLA (1%). No SCA3 family was 
      found. Twenty-four percent of the families carried a still unidentified mutation. 
      When occurrence of mutations was evaluated according to the geographic origin, 
      SCA1 was the commonest in Northern (72%), whereas SCA2 was prevalent (63%) in 
      Southern Italy. The number of CAG repeats in SCA1 normal alleles was higher in 
      Northern than in Central-Southern Italy.

TI  - Prevalence of triplet repeat expansion in ataxia patients from Hokkaido, the 
      northernmost island of Japan.
PG  - 45-51
AB  - Approximately 44% of cases of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) in Hokkaido, the 
      northernmost island of Japan, were estimated to be inherited. To determine the 
      prevalence of triplet repeat expansion in hereditary SCA patients, we genotyped 
      seven genetically defined dominant SCAs in 349 patients, including 266 patients 
      from 77 families, 78 probands from unrelated families with hereditary late-onset 
      SCA, and five patients in whom a family history of SCA was not demonstrated. The 
      frequency of each disorder in a total of 155 unrelated families was 23.9% for 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), 29.0% for SCA6, 9.7% for SCA1, 7.7% for SCA2, and 
      2.6% for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. Abnormal expansion of triplet 
      repeats for SCA7 and SCA8 was not detected. A total of 27.1% of the patients had 
      still unknown SCA mutations. In addition, the GAA repeat in the frataxin gene was 
      not abnormally expanded in 13 early-onset SCA patients with clinical features 
      similar to those of Friedreich ataxia. Comparison of our results with those from 
      other centers handling SCA showed that MJD is prevalent throughout Japan, but the 
      frequencies of other dominant SCAs differ considerably even within Japan.

TI  - Frequency of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, and DRPLA CAG trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in patients with hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia from Chinese 
      kindreds.
PG  - 540-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of SCA1 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 1), SCA2, 
      SCA3/MJD (spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, and 
      DRPLA (dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy) CAG trinucleotide repeat expansions 
      [(CAG)n] among persons diagnosed with hereditary SCA from Chinese families. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, SCA7, 
      and DRPLA (CAG)n mutation were detected with the polymerase chain reaction, 
      highly denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and silver staining 
      technique in 167 patients with autosomal dominant SCA from 85 Chinese families 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA. RESULTS: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (CAG)n 
      mutation in 7 patients from 4 kindreds (4.70%) was expanded to 53 to 62 repeats. 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (CAG)n mutation in 12 patients from 5 kindreds 
      (5.88%) was expanded to 42 to 47 repeats. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 
      3/Machado-Joseph disease (CAG)n mutation in 83 patients from 41 kindreds (48.23%) 
      was expanded to 68 to 83 repeats. Sixty-five patients from 35 kindreds (41.19%) 
      and 37 patients with sporadic SCA did not test positive for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, 
      SCA6, SCA7, or DRPLA. There was a predictable inverse relationship between the 
      number of CAG repeats and the age at onset for SCA3/MJD and SCA2. Clinically, 
      dementia and hyporeflexia were more frequent in patients with SCA2, while 
      spasticity, hyperreflexia, and Babinski signs were more frequent in patients with 
      SCA3/ MJD, and those might be helpful in clinical work to primarily distinguish 
      patients with SCA3/MJD and SCA2 from others with different types of SCA. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of SCA3/MJD is substantially higher than that of SCA1 
      and SCA2 in patients with autosomal dominant SCA from Chinese kindreds, who are 
      non-Portuguese. Clinical expressions of the various types of SCAs overlap one 
      another; therefore, for clinical study it is important to make a gene diagnosis 
      and genetic classification for patients with SCA.

TI  - Absence of unidentified CAG repeat expansion in patients with Huntington's 
      disease-like phenotype.
PG  - 672-5
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by an expanded (CAG)n repeat on the huntingtin gene. It is characterised 
      by motor, psychiatric and cognitive disturbances. Diagnosis can be confirmed by 
      direct genetic testing, which is highly sensitive and specific and is now 
      considered definitive. This study focused on 21 patients presenting with a 
      clinical phenotype showing strong similarity to HD, but who do not have an 
      expanded CAG in the huntingtin gene. However, other possible diagnoses could be 
      evoked for most of them. Seven patients (3.5% of our cohort) could be considered 
      as phenocopies of HD with no alternative diagnosis. Samples were screened for 
      other triplet repeat diseases with similar presentation (DRPLA, SCA-1, SCA-2, 
      SCA-3, SCA-6, and SCA-7) and were all negative. The repeat expansion detection 
      technique (RED) was used to detect uncloned CAG repeat expansions and samples 
      were also analysed by polymerase chain reaction for expansions of the polymorphic 
      CAG-ERDA-1 and CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeats. RED expansion (>40 repeats) was 
      detected in only one patient. The results suggest that unstable CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions corresponding to known or unknown sequences are not involved in the 
      aetiology of HD-like disorders. It is hypothesised that some of these phenocopies 
      could correspond to mutations in other unidentified genes with other unstable 
      repeats (different from CAG) or in unknown genes with other mutations.

TI  - Molecular and clinical analyses of spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 in Japan.
PG  - 950-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the molecular and clinical features of the newly identified 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8). METHODS: We analyzed the CTG repeat region 
      of the SCA8 gene in a series of Japanese patients with cerebellar ataxia. We also 
      investigated the frequency of the CTG repeat length in Japanese normal elderly 
      subjects older than age 79. Morphometric measurements on the cerebral MRI were 
      compared between patients with SCA8 and SCA6. RESULTS: The number of the combined 
      CTA/CTG repeats of six affected SCA8 alleles was 106.3+/-24.4 (mean +/- SD) 
      ranging from 89 to 155 and that of normal elderly subjects was 24.3+/-4.4 (n = 
      104 alleles) ranging from 15 to 34. The mean age at onset of the SCA8 cases was 
      53.8+/-19.7 years, with a range from 20 to 73 years. One father and daughter from 
      an SCA8 family showed remarkable paternal anticipation. The number increase from 
      father to daughter was + 16 CTG repeats, with a 31-year acceleration of onset. 
      The six identified SCA8 patients were clinically characterized by high 
      frequencies of incoordination of trunk and limbs, ataxic dysarthria, impaired 
      smooth pursuit, and horizontal nystagmus, and the MRI showed significant atrophy 
      of the cerebellar vermis and hemispheres compared with that of normal controls. 
      There was no significant difference between SCA8 and SCA6 on the morphometric MRI 
      study. CONCLUSIONS: The CTG repeat expansions in the SCA8 alleles were much 
      greater than the range of repeats in normal elderly subjects. The SCA8 phenotype 
      manifested by cerebellar symptoms and atrophy corresponded to features of the 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type III (ADCA III).

TI  - Immunogenicity of P/Q-type calcium channel in small cell lung cancer: 
      investigation of alpha1 subunit polyglutamine expansion.
PG  - 592-6
AB  - The ectopic expression of neuronal P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels in 
      small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is thought to induce antisynaptic autoimmunity 
      in the paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. The gene CACNL1A4, 
      encoding the principal (alpha1A) subunit of this calcium channel, is mutated in 
      several inherited neurological disorders. One of these disorders (spinocerebellar 
      ataxia, type 6, or SCA-6) involves the expansion of a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat 
      unit. We hypothesized that a somatic CAG repeat instability of this gene in 
      neoplastic cells might generate a non-self epitope capable of initiating 
      autoimmunity to P/Q-type calcium channels. We therefore analyzed the CACNL1A4 
      gene in SCLC lines established from metastases derived from seven individual 
      patients (four associated with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, one associated 
      with myasthenia gravis, and two not associated with neurological autoimmunity). 
      We compared their CAG repeat numbers (determined by polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) amplification followed by separation of products on a 6% polyacrylamide/8M 
      urea gel) to published norms and to DNA from a patient with SCA-6. The number of 
      CAG repeats in SCLC DNA fell within a normal range whether or not the neoplasm 
      was complicated by neurological autoimmunity. Therefore, it is unlikely that 
      somatically unstable CAG repeat units in the gene encoding the P/Q-type 
      voltage-gated calcium channel account for this tumor protein's immunogenicity in 
      the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.

TI  - Pontine atrophy in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 17-22
AB  - To investigate the clinical range of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), we 
      screened CAG repeat expansion in the voltage-dependent alpha 1A calcium channel 
      gene (CACNL1A4) in 71 ataxic patients in 60 families; 54 patients in 43 families 
      with hereditary ataxia and 17 sporadic patients. Thirteen patients with SCA6 were 
      detected to have elongated CAG in CACNL1A4. Of these, 7 patients had been 
      diagnosed as having hereditary cerebellar cortical atrophy, and 6 patients had 
      been found to have sporadic occurrence. One patient showed distinct pontine 
      atrophy with prominent horizontal or oblique gaze nystagmus which is an unusual 
      feature in sporadic olivopontocerebellar atrophy. For the efficient screening of 
      SCA6, we would propose testing CAG repeat expansion in CACNL1A4, in patients with 
      one of two markers: (1) horizontal or oblique gaze nystagmus without other eye 
      movement disorders, (2) pure cerebellar atrophy, even if occurrence is sporadic. 
      We should note that the pontine atrophy could also be caused by CAG repeat 
      expansion in CACNL1A4.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxias in Spanish patients: genetic analysis of familial and 
      sporadic cases. The Ataxia Study Group.
PG  - 516-22
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically heterogeneous group 
      of neurodegenerative disorders caused by unstable CAG repeat expansions encoding 
      polyglutamine tracts. Five spinocerebellar ataxia genes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 
      and SCA7) and another related dominant ataxia gene (DRPLA) have been cloned, 
      allowing the genetic classification of these disorders. We present here the 
      molecular analysis of 87 unrelated familial and 60 sporadic Spanish cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia. For ADCA cases 15% were SCA2, 15% SCA3, 6% SCA1, 3% SCA7, 
      1% SCA6 and 1% DRPLA, an extremely rare mutation in Caucasoid populations. About 
      58% of ADCA cases remained genetically unclassified. All the SCA1 cases belong to 
      the same geographical area and share a common haplotype for the SCA1 mutation. 
      The expanded alleles ranged from 41 to 59 repeats for SCA1, 35 to 46 [corrected] 
      for SCA2, 67 to 77 for SCA3, and 38 to 113 for SCA7. One SCA6 case had 25 repeats 
      and one DRPLA case had 63 repeats. The highest CAG repeat variation in meiotic 
      transmission of expanded alleles was detected in SCA7, this being of +67 units in 
      one paternal transmission and giving rise to a 113 CAG repeat allele in a patient 
      who died at 3 years of age. Meiotic transmissions have also shown a tendency to 
      more frequent paternal transmission of expanded alleles in SCA1 and maternal in 
      SCA7. All SCA1 and SCA2 expanded alleles analyzed consisted of pure CAG repeats, 
      whereas normal alleles were interrupted by 1-2 CAT trinucleotides in SCA1, except 
      for three alleles of 6, 14 and 21 CAG repeats, and by 1-3 CAA trinucleotides in 
      SCA2. No SCA or DRPLA mutations were detected in the 60 sporadic cases of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia, but one late onset patient was identified as a recessive 
      form due to GAA-repeat expansions in the Friedreich's ataxia gene.

TI  - An autopsy case of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 with mental symptoms of 
      schizophrenia and dementia.
PG  - 198-204
AB  - We herein report the findings of an autopsy case of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 
      (SCA6) which revealed a mild CAG-repeat expansion in the alpha1A 
      voltage-dependent calcium channel (CACNL1A4) gene on chromosome 19p13. A 
      39-year-old man who showed slowly progressive mental disorders and gait ataxia 
      was clinically diagnosed to have cortical cerebellar atrophy (CCA) and 
      schizophrenia. None of his relatives revealed any symptoms such as 
      spinocerebellar disease, however, his younger brother had shown some mental 
      disorders. The patient eventually died at 52 years of age, and an autopsy was 
      thus performed. The main histopathological findings included a severe neuronal 
      cell loss of Purkinje cells and inferior olivary nuclei. The number of Purkinje 
      cells in our case had decreased severely in comparison to that in either OPCA or 
      age-matched control cases, and the Purkinje cells in the cerebellar hemisphere 
      were more affected than those in the cerebellar vermis. The neurons of the 
      dentate nucleus and pontine nuclei were well-preserved, and no pathological 
      changes were seen in cerebral cortices or basal ganglia. The clinicopathological 
      findings were similar to those of late cortical cerebellar atrophy (LCCA), 
      Holmes' cortical cerebellar atrophy (Holmes type) or SCA6 cases reported 
      previously. Using genomic DNA extracted from archival paraffin-embedded sections 
      in the frontal lobe, cerebral basal ganglia and cerebellum, the identical mild 
      CAG-repeat expansions in the CACNL1A4/SCA6 gene were revealed in all samples 
      examined. These findings suggest that in cases with LCCA or Holmes type atrophy, 
      we should thus examine the CAG-repeat expansions in the SCA6 gene, and the 
      genomic DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded sections was thus found to be useful

TI  - Abundant expression and cytoplasmic aggregations of [alpha]1A voltage-dependent 
      calcium channel protein associated with neurodegeneration in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 6.
PG  - 1185-93
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is one of the eight neurodegenerative 
      diseases caused by a tri-nucleotide (CAG) repeat expansion coding polyglutamine 
      (CAG repeat/polyglutamine diseases) and is characterized by late onset autosomal 
      dominant cerebellar ataxia and predominant loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells. 
      Although the causative, small and stable CAG repeat expansion for this disease 
      has been identified in the [alpha]1A voltage-dependent calcium channel gene 
      (CACNA1A), the mechanism which leads to predominant Purkinje cell degeneration is 
      totally unknown. In this study, we show that the calcium channel mRNA/protein 
      containing the CAG repeat/polyglutamine tract is most intensely expressed in 
      Purkinje cells of human brains. In SCA6 brains, numerous oval or rod-shaped 
      aggregates were seen exclusively in the cytoplasm of Purkinje cells. These 
      cytoplasmic inclusions were not ubiquitinated, which contrasts with the neuronal 
      intra-nuclear inclusions of other CAG repeat/polyglutamine diseases. In cultured 
      cells, formation of perinuclear aggregates of the channel protein and apoptotic 
      cell death were seen when transfected with full-length CACNA1A coding an expanded 
      polyglutamine tract. The present study indicates that the mechanism of 
      neurodegeneration in SCA6 is associated with cytoplasmic aggregations of the 
      [alpha]1A calcium channel protein caused by a small CAG repeat/polyglutamine 
      expansion in CACNA1A.

PG  - 86-9
AB  - To clarify the clinical, neuropathological, and molecular characteristics of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), two unrelated Japanese families with SCA6 
      were studied. A clinical feature of the two families was late onset "pure" 
      cerebellar ataxia. Pathologically, three SCA6 brains consistently showed Purkinje 
      cell dominant cortical cerebellar degeneration. Morphometric analysis showed that 
      loss of the cerebellar granule cells and inferior olivary neurons were very mild 
      compared with the severity of Purkinje cell loss. There was no obvious ubiquitin 
      immunoreactive nuclear inclusions. All affected patients had identical expanded 
      alleles, and the expansion was also homogeneously distributed throughout the 
      brain without mosaicism. The present study showed that SCA6 is characterised by 
      Purkinje cell dominant cortical cerebellar degeneration, highly stable 
      transmission of the CAG repeat expansion, and lack of ubiquitin immunoreactive 
      nuclear inclusions.

TI  - Direct alteration of the P/Q-type Ca2+ channel property by polyglutamine 
      expansion in spinocerebellar ataxia 6.
PG  - RC14
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 6 (SCA6) is caused by expansion of a polyglutamine 
      stretch, encoded by a CAG trinucleotide repeat, in the human P/Q-type Ca(2+) 
      channel alpha(1A) subunit. Although SCA6 shares common features with other 
      neurodegenerative glutamine repeat disorders, the polyglutamine repeats in SCA6 
      are exceptionally small, ranging from 21 to 33. Because this size is too small to 
      form insoluble aggregates that have been blamed for the cause of 
      neurodegeneration, SCA6 is the disorder suitable for exploring the pathogenic 
      mechanisms other than aggregate formation, whose universal role has been 
      questioned. To characterize the pathogenic process of SCA6, we studied the 
      effects of polyglutamine expansion on channel properties by analyzing currents 
      flowing through the P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels with an expanded stretch of 24, 30, 
      or 40 polyglutamines, recombinantly expressed in baby hamster kidney cells. 
      Whereas the Ca(2+) channels with </=24 polyglutamines showed normal properties, 
      the Ca(2+) channels with 30 or 40 polyglutamines exhibited an 8 mV 
      hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation, which 
      considerably reduces the available channel population at a resting membrane 
      potential. The results suggest that polyglutamine expansion in SCA6 leads to 
      neuronal death and cerebellar atrophy through reduction in Ca(2+) influx into 
      Purkinje cells and other neurons. Besides the widely accepted notion that 
      polyglutamine stretches exert toxic effects by forming aggregates, expanded 
      polyglutamines directly alter functions of the affected gene product.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 in relation to CAG repeat length.
PG  - 209-12
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to assess the relationship between clinical 
      characteristics of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) and CAG repeat length. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined clinical symptoms of 54 patients with SCA6. 
      CAG repeat length was compared among subgroups divided by clinical 
      manifestations. RESULTS: The major symptom was progressive cerebellar ataxia. 
      Truncal or limb ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus were observed in more than 80% 
      of the patients. In analysis of CAG repeat length in patients with different 
      types of nystagmus, CAG repeat length was the longest when both upbeat and 
      downbeat nystagmus existed (P < 0.01). In addition, CAG repeat length was longer 
      when the initial symptom was ataxic gait and was shorter when the initial symptom 
      was dysarthria or ocular symptom (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Clinical features of 
      SCA6 might be influenced by the length of abnormal CAG repeat.

TI  - Mapping of a new autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia to chromosome 22.
PG  - 594-9
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) are a clinically and 
      genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. The clinical symptoms include 
      cerebellar dysfunction and associated signs from dysfunction in other parts of 
      the nervous system. So far, five spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) genes have been 
      identified: SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7. Loci for SCA4 and SCA5 have been 
      mapped. However, approximately one-third of SCAs have remained unassigned. We 
      have identified a Mexican American pedigree that segregates a new form of ataxia 
      clinically characterized by gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus. Two 
      individuals have seizures. After excluding all known genetic loci for linkage, we 
      performed a genomewide search and identified linkage to a 15-cM region on 
      chromosome 22q13. A maximum LOD score of 4.3 (recombination fraction 0) was 
      obtained for D22S928 and D22S1161. This distinct form of ataxia has been 
      designated "SCA10." Anticipation was observed in the available parent-child 
      pairs, suggesting that trinucleotide-repeat expansion may be the mutagenic 
      mechanism.

TI  - Recurrence of the T666M calcium channel CACNA1A gene mutation in familial 
      hemiplegic migraine with progressive cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 89-98
AB  - Familial hemiplegic migraine (HM) is an autosomal dominant migraine with aura. In 
      20% of HM families, HM is associated with a mild permanent cerebellar ataxia 
      (PCA). The CACNA1A gene encoding the alpha1A subunit of P/Q-type voltage-gated 
      calcium channels is involved in 50% of unselected HM families and in all families 
      with HM/PCA. Four CACNA1A missense mutations have been identified in HM: two in 
      pure HM and two in HM/PCA. Different CACNA1A mutations have been identified in 
      other autosomal dominant conditions: mutations leading to a truncated protein in 
      episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), small expansions of a CAG trinucleotide in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 and also in three families with EA2 features, and, 
      finally, a missense mutation in a single family suffering from episodic ataxia 
      and severe progressive PCA. We screened 16 families and 3 nonfamilial case 
      patients affected by HM/PCA for specific CACNA1A mutations and found nine 
      families and one nonfamilial case with the same T666M mutation, one new mutation 
      (D715E) in one family, and no CAG repeat expansion. Both T666M and D715E 
      substitutions were absent in 12 probands belonging to pure HM families whose 
      disease appears to be linked to CACNA1A. Finally, haplotyping with neighboring 
      markers suggested that T666M arose through recurrent mutational events. These 
      data could indicate that the PCA observed in 20% of HM families results from 
      specific pathophysiologic mechanisms.

TI  - Molecular analysis of a de novo mutation for spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 and 
      (CAG)n repeat units in normal elder controls.
PG  - 85-7
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      degenerative disease caused by CAG repeat expansions in the human alpha1A 
      voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit gene (CACNL1A4). We analyzed 15 SCA6 
      patients in 14 unrelated Japanese families and 52 healthy Japanese aged over 74 
      years. Sequence analysis was performed to determine the correct number of CAG 
      repeats. The expanded CAG repeat number was 23.6+/-2.1 (mean+/-S.D., n=15) with a 
      range of 20-29, and the shortest expanded allele was 20 repeats. Moreover, the 
      analysis of normal subjects revealed that the CAG repeat number of normal alleles 
      was 12.3+/-1.9 (n=104) with a range of 7-18. We concluded that the normal range 
      of CAG repeats in the CACNL1A4 gene is 18 or less, and that the disease range is 
      20 or more. Of 15 SCA6 patients, three sporadic cases were observed. In one male 
      patient with 26 CAG repeats, the CAG repeat numbers of his parents were within 
      normal range. His expanded allele was considered to be caused by an expansion of 
      a normal allele from his mother (14 or 17 repeats). This is the first SCA6 case 
      which was genetically proven to occur due to a de novo mechanism, suggesting that 
      larger CAG repeats of normal alleles in the CACNL1A4 gene may be unstable and 
      result in full expansion.

TI  - Incidence of dominant spinocerebellar and Friedreich triplet repeats among 361 
      ataxia families.
PG  - 1666-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 
      3, 6, and 7 and Friedreich's ataxia (FA) among a large panel of ataxia families. 
      BACKGROUND: The ataxias are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative diseases that variably affect the cerebellum, brainstem, and 
      spinocerebellar tracts. Trinucleotide repeat expansions have been shown to be the 
      mutational mechanism for five dominantly inherited SCAs as well as FA. METHODS: 
      We collected DNA samples and clinical data from patients representing 361 
      families with adult-onset ataxia of unknown etiology. Patients with a clinical 
      diagnosis of FA were specifically excluded from our collection. RESULTS: Among 
      the 178 dominant kindreds, we found SCA1 expansion at a frequency of 5.6%, SCA2 
      expansion at a frequency of 15.2%, SCA3 expansion at a frequency of 20.8%, SCA6 
      expansion at a frequency of 15.2%, and SCA7 expansion at a frequency of 4.5%. FA 
      alleles were found in 11.4% of apparently recessive and 5.2% of apparently 
      sporadic patients. Among these patients the repeat sizes for one or both FA 
      alleles were relatively small, with sizes for the smaller allele ranging from 90 
      to 600 GAA repeats. The clinical presentation for these patients is atypical for 
      FA, with one or more of the following characteristics: adult onset of disease, 
      retained tendon reflexes, normal plantar response, and intact or partially intact 
      sensory perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogenic trinucleotide repeat expansions were 
      found among 61% of the dominant kindreds. Among patients with apparently 
      recessive or negative family histories of ataxia, 6.8% and 4.4% tested positive 
      for a CAG expansion at one of the dominant loci, and 11.4 and 5.2% of patients 
      with apparently recessive or sporadic forms of ataxia had FA expansions. Because 
      of the significant implications that a dominant versus recessive inheritance 
      pattern has for future generations, it is important to screen patients who do not 
      have a clearly dominant inheritance pattern for expansions at both the FA and the 
      dominant ataxia loci.

TI  - Characteristic magnetic resonance imaging findings in spinocerebellar ataxia 6.
PG  - 1348-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      findings in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia 6 (SCA6) diagnosed by genetic 
      analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using MRI, we examined 10 patients genetically 
      diagnosed as having SCA6 and 40 control subjects. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) CAG 
      repeat length in 10 patients with SCA6 was 22.9 +/- 1.3. There was a significant 
      inverse correlation between the CAG repeat size and age at onset in the SCA6 
      group (r = -0.86, P = .003). In patients with SCA6, the areas of the cerebellar 
      vermis and hemispheres in sagittal MRI were significantly smaller than those in 
      the control subjects. In transaxial MRI, the anteroposterior diameter of the pons 
      and the diameter of the middle cerebellar peduncle were mildly decreased and the 
      red nucleus was slightly atrophied in patients with SCA6. There was no 
      significant difference in the diameter of the midbrain, medulla oblongata, fourth 
      ventricle, superior cerebellar peduncles, dentate nucleus, or globus pallidus 
      between the SCA6 and control groups. A high-signal intensity in the transverse 
      pontine fibers was not observed in any of the patients with SCA6 on T2-weighted 
      and/or proton-weighted axial MRI. CONCLUSIONS: The cerebellum and its afferent 
      and efferent systems were affected in patients with SCA6. These results seem to 
      distinguish the MRI findings of SCA6 from those of other forms of spinocerebellar 
      ataxia.

TI  - Close associations between prevalences of dominantly inherited spinocerebellar 
      ataxias with CAG-repeat expansions and frequencies of large normal CAG alleles in 
      Japanese and Caucasian populations.
PG  - 1060-6
AB  - To test the hypothesis that the frequencies of normal alleles (ANs) with a 
      relatively large number of CAG repeats (large ANs) are related to the prevalences 
      of the dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs)-SCA types 1, 2, 3 (Machado-Joseph 
      disease), 6, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA)-we investigated the 
      relative prevalences of these diseases in 202 Japanese and 177 Caucasian families 
      and distributions of the number of CAG repeats of ANs at these disease loci in 
      normal individuals in each population. The relative prevalences of SCA1 and SCA2 
      were significantly higher in Caucasian pedigrees (15% and 14%, respectively) than 
      in Japanese pedigrees (3% and 5%, respectively), corresponding to the observation 
      that the frequencies of large ANs of SCA1 (alleles >30 repeats) and of SCA2 
      (alleles >22 repeats) were significantly higher in Caucasians than in Japanese. 
      The relative prevalences of MJD/SCA3, SCA6, and DRPLA were significantly higher 
      in Japanese pedigrees (43%, 11%, and 20%, respectively) than in Caucasian 
      pedigrees (30%, 5%, and 0%, respectively), corresponding to the observation that 
      the frequencies of large ANs of MJD/SCA3 (>27 repeats), SCA6 (>13 repeats), and 
      DRPLA (>17 repeats) were significantly higher in Japanese than in Caucasians. The 
      close correlations of the relative prevalences of the dominant SCAs with the 
      distributions of large ANs strongly support the assumption that large ANs 
      contribute to generation of expanded alleles (AEs) and the relative prevalences 
      of the dominant SCAs.

PG  - 148-51
AB  - We searched for mutations in the voltage-gated calcium channel gene, CACNA1A, in 
      nine propositi of families with migraine headaches and episodic vertigo inherited 
      in an autosomal dominant pattern. All 47 exons and flanking introns in CACNA1A 
      were subjected to single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of polymerase 
      chain reaction-amplified genomic DNA. Exons with aberrantly migrating fragments 
      were sequenced using standard techniques. We also determined the CAG repeat 
      length at the 3' end of CACNA1A. Several polymorphisms were found but no 
      mutations identified in any of the 47 exons of the 9 patients. No index-case had 
      a CAG repeat length greater than 13 (normal <17). Mutations in CACNA1A are not 
      common in families with migraine headaches and episodic vertigo. Other ion 
      channel genes expressed in the brain and inner ear remain candidate genes.

TI  - CAG repeat expansions in patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 55-9
AB  - CAG repeat expansions cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), SCA2, SCA3, 
      SCA6 and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). So far these expansions 
      have been examined mainly in ataxia patients with a family history. However, some 
      sporadic cases with SCA have recently been reported. To elucidate the frequency 
      and characteristics of sporadic SCAs, we screened 85 Japanese ataxia patients 
      without a family history for the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and DRPLA mutations. As a 
      result, 19 patients (22%) were found to have expanded CAG repeats. Among sporadic 
      SCAs, the SCA6 mutation was most frequently observed. The sporadic SCA6 patients 
      had smaller CAG repeats and a later age of onset than SCA6 patients with an 
      established family history. We also identified one father-child pair in which 
      intermediate sized CAG repeats expanded into the SCA2 disease range during 
      transmission. These findings suggest that patients with ataxia even without a 
      family history should be examined for a CAG repeat expansion.

TI  - Patients with features similar to Huntington's disease, without CAG expansion in 
      huntingtin.
PG  - 215-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe characteristics of gene-negative patients with clinical 
      features of Huntington's disease (HD), exploring likely etiologies. BACKGROUND: 
      When a direct gene test became definitive for diagnosis of HD, we discovered a 
      number of patients in our clinics in Baltimore, MD, and Cambridge, UK, believed 
      or suspected to have HD who did not have the triplet repeat expansion. METHODS: 
      Patients were examined using standardized instruments, and given full neurologic 
      and psychiatric evaluations. Those negative for HD were tested for 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy, SCA-1, SCA-3, SCA-2, SCA-6, and other 
      conditions as indicated. RESULTS: Of 15 patients, 7 received specific diagnoses 
      or appear to be sporadic cases, 4 have a possible but uncertain relation to HD, 
      and 4 have unknown familial progressive movement disorders. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      last group of patients might be properly described as phenocopies of HD, some of 
      which may be caused by unidentified triplet repeat expansions.

TI  - Analysis of SCA1, DRPLA, MJD, SCA2, and SCA6 CAG repeats in 48 Portuguese ataxia 
      families.
PG  - 134-8
AB  - The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are clinically and genetically a heterogeneous 
      group of neurodegenerative disorders. To date, eight different loci causing SCA 
      have been identified: SCA1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA4, SCA5, 
      SCA6, SCA7, and dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). Expansion of a CAG 
      repeat in the disease genes has been found in five of these disorders. To 
      estimate the relative frequencies of the SCA1, DRPLA, MJD, SCA2, and SCA6 
      mutations among Portuguese ataxia patients, we collected DNA samples from 48 
      ataxia families and performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of 
      the CAG repeat mutations on chromosomes 6p, 12p, 14q, 12q, and 19p, respectively. 
      Fifty-five individuals belonging to 34 dominant families (74%) had an expanded 
      CAG repeat at the MJD gene. In five individuals from two kindreds with a dominant 
      pattern of inheritance (4%), an expanded CAG repeat at the SCA2 gene was found. 
      In MJD patients, the normal allele size ranged from 13 to 41, whereas the mutant 
      alleles contained 65 to 80 repeats. For the SCA2 patients, normal alleles had 22 
      or 23, while expanded alleles had between 36 and 47 CAG units. We did not find 
      the SCA1, DRPLA, or SCA6 mutations in our group of families. The MJD mutation 
      remains the most common cause of SCA in Portugal, while a small number of cases 
      are caused by mutations at the SCA2 gene, and 22% are due to still unidentified 
      genes.

AB  - We report on seven Japanese families with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) 
      carrying small CAG repeat expansions in the calcium channel alpha1A subunit gene. 
      The number of the expanded CAG repeat, ranged from 22 to 25, showed no 
      intergenerational instability and had a significant inverse correlation with the 
      age of onset. The clinical features of these patients were late onset progressive 
      pure cerebellar ataxia with dysarthria and nystagmus, and are consistent with 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type III (ADCA type III). Magnetic resonance 
      imaging scan of the brain demonstrated cerebellar atrophy with no evidence of 
      brainstem involvement. We propose that clinical phenotype of SCA6 is compatible 
      with ADCA type III and SCA6 is one of the most common types of ADCA in Japan.

TI  - SCA6 mutation analysis in a large cohort of the Japanese patients with late-onset 
      pure cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 89-95
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is caused by small CAG repeat expansion in 
      the gene encoding the alpha1A-voltage-dependent-calcium channel subunit 
      (CACNLIA4) on chromosome 19p13, and is a subgroup of the late-onset pure 
      cerebellar ataxia (ADCA III). To investigate the prevalence of SCA6 in the 
      Japanese, we analyzed this mutation in 23 families and 12 probands with ADCA III. 
      The specificity and stability of the CAG repeat were examined in additional 
      individuals and families with other miscellaneous dominant SCAs. The CAG 
      expansion of SCA6 gene was exclusively observed in 12 of 23 families (52%) and 12 
      proband cases with ADCA III, but not in others. The CAG repeat was 21-33 in the 
      disease-associated alleles (n=56), and 4-18 in normal alleles (n=1148). Expanded 
      alleles were stable during transmission, and a significant inverse correlation 
      for CAG repeat number with age at onset was noted. Our results indicate that SCA6 
      shares approximately half of the ADCA III in the Japanese, and that gene 
      mutations causing the remaining, have yet to be identified.

TI  - Uncloned expanded CAG/CTG repeat sequences in autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia (ADCA) detected by the repeat expansion detection (RED) method.
PG  - 99-102
AB  - In some neurodegenerative diseases, genetic anticipation correlates with 
      expansions of the CAG/CTG repeat sequence above the normal range through the 
      generations of a pedigree. Among these neurodegenerative diseases are late onset 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA). ADCA are genetically heterogeneous 
      disorders with different cloned genes for spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), 
      type 2 (SCA2), type 3 or Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), and type 6 (SCA6). 
      Another related dominant ataxia, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), 
      also shows CAG/CTG repeat expansions. Genetic anticipation has been reported for 
      all of them except for the recently cloned SCA6 gene. Other, as yet undetected 
      SCA genes may show the same features. We have used the repeat expansion detection 
      (RED) method to detect repeat expansions directly in DNA samples from ADCA 
      patients not resulting from known genes. Our sample consists of 19 affected index 
      cases, corresponding to 52.8% of our ADCA families without CAG/CTG repeat 
      expansions in the SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, SCA6, or DRPLA genes. Eighty-nine percent 
      of the index cases had expansions of a CAG/CTG sequence greater than 40 repeats 
      by RED, while these were observed in only 26.9% of 78 healthy subjects from the 
      general population (p < 0.0001). The distribution of RED fragments in controls 
      and ADCA patients also shows significant differences with the Mann-Whitney U test 
      (U = 376.5, p = 0.0007). Moreover, there was a significant inverse correlation 
      between the size of expansion and the age of onset (r = -0.54, p = 0.018). These 
      results show CAG/CTG repeat expansions of over 40 repeats in our sample of ADCA 
      families not resulting from known SCA genes.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6: genotype and phenotype in German kindreds.
PG  - 67-73
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is an autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) of which the mutation causing the disease has recently 
      been characterised as an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat in the gene coding for 
      the alpha1A-subunit of the voltage dependent calcium channel. The aim was to 
      further characterise the SCA6 phenotype METHODS: The SCA6 mutation was 
      investigated in 69 German families with ADCA and 61 patients with idiopathic 
      sporadic cerebellar ataxia and the CAG repeat length of the expanded allele was 
      correlated with the disease phenotype. RESULTS: Expanded alleles were found in 
      nine of 69 families as well as in four patients with sporadic disease. Disease 
      onset ranged from 30 to 71 years of age and was significantly later than in other 
      forms of ADCA. Age at onset correlated inversely with repeat length. The SCA6 
      phenotype comprises predominantly cerebellar signs in concordance with isolated 
      cerebellar atrophy on MRI. Non-cerebellar systems were only mildly affected with 
      external ophthalmoplegia, spasticity, peripheral neuropathy, and parkinsonism. 
      Neither these clinical signs nor progression rate correlated with CAG repeat 
      length. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first detailed characterisation of 
      the SCA6 phenotype. Clinical features apart from cerebellar signs were highly 
      variable in patients with SCA6. By comparison with SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3 no 
      clinical or electrophysiological finding was specific for SCA6. Therefore, the 
      molecular defect cannot be predicted from clinical investigations. In Germany, 
      SCA6 accounts for about 13% of families with ADCA. However, up to 30% of SCA6 
      kindreds may be misdiagnosed clinically as sporadic disease due to late 
      manifestation in apparently healthy parents. Genetic testing is therefore 
      recommended for the SCA6 mutation also in patients with putative sporadic ataxia.

TI  - Polymorphisms at 13 expressed human sequences containing CAG/CTG repeats and 
      analysis in autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) patients.
PG  - 18-21
AB  - Genetic anticipation--increasing severity and a decrease in the age of onset with 
      successive generations of a pedigree--is clearly present in autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia (ADCA). Anticipation is correlated with expansion of the 
      CAG/CTG repeat sequence to sizes above those in the normal range through the 
      generations of a pedigree. Genetic heterogeneity has been demonstrated for ADCA, 
      with four cloned genes (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD, and SCA6) and three mapped loci 
      (SCA4, SCA5 and SCA7). Another related dominant ataxia, 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), presents anticipation with CAG/CTG 
      repeat expansions. We had previously analysed ADCA patients who had not shown 
      repeat expansions in cloned genes for CAG/CTG repeat expansions by the repeat 
      expansion detection method (RED) and had detected expansions of between 48 and 88 
      units in 17 unrelated familial cases. We present here an analysis of 13 genes and 
      expressed sequence tags (ESTs) containing 10 or more CAG/CTG repeat sequences 
      selected from public databases in the 17 unrelated ADCA patients. Of the 13 
      selected genes and ESTs, 9 were found to be polymorphic with heterozygosities 
      ranging between 0.09 and 0.80 and 2 to 17 alleles. In ADCA patients none of the 
      loci showed expansions above the normal range of the CAG/CTG repeat sequences, 
      excluding them as the mutation causing ADCA.

TI  - Clinical and molecular features of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 1243-6
AB  - The mutation involved in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a small CAG 
      expansion in the alpha-1A subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel gene. 
      We looked for this mutation in 91 families with autosomal-dominant cerebellar 
      ataxias and found that SCA6 is a minor locus in our series (2%) and is rare in 
      France (1%). Furthermore, we did not detect the SCA6 mutation on 146 sporadic 
      cases with isolated cerebellar ataxia or olivopontocerebellar atrophy. The normal 
      and expanded alleles ranged from 4 to 15 and 22 to 28 CAG repeats, respectively, 
      and age at onset was correlated to CAG repeat length (r = -0.87). In contrast 
      with other SCA, the expanded allele was stable during transmission. Clinically, 
      SCA6 patients (n = 12) presented with moderate to severe cerebellar ataxia with a 
      lower frequency of associated signs compared with other SCA and a mean age at 
      onset of 45 +/- 14 years (range, 24 to 67). MRI showed extensive cerebellar 
      atrophy but not of the brainstem or cerebral cortex.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6. Molecular and clinical features of 35 Japanese 
      patients including one homozygous for the CAG repeat expansion.
PG  - 1238-43
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a newly classified autosomal-dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) associated with CAG repeat expansion. We screened 111 
      patients with cerebellar ataxia for the SCA6 mutation. Of these, 35 patients were 
      found to have expanded CAG repeats in the SCA6 gene, indicating that second to 
      SCA3, SCA6 is the most common ADCA in Japan. Expanded alleles ranged from 21 to 
      29 repeats, whereas normal alleles had seven to 17 repeats. There was no change 
      in the CAG repeat length during meiosis. The age at onset was inversely 
      correlated with the repeat length. The main clinical feature of the 35 patients 
      with SCA6 was slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia; multisystem involvement was 
      not common. The 35 patients included nine cases without apparent family history 
      of cerebellar ataxia. The sporadic cases had smaller CAG repeats (21 or 22 
      repeats) and a later age at onset (64.9 +/- 4.9 years) than the other cases with 
      established family history. We also identified one patient who was homozygous for 
      the SCA6 repeat expansion. The homozygote showed an earlier age of onset and more 
      severe clinical manifestations than her sister, a heterozygote carrying an 
      expanded allele with the same repeat length as the homozygote. This finding 
      suggests that the dosage of the CAG repeat expansion plays an important role in 
      phenotypic expression in SCA6.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia: phenotypic differences in genetically 
      defined subtypes?
PG  - 924-32
AB  - Seventy-seven families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia were analyzed 
      for the CAG repeat expansions causing spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 
      and 6. The SCA1 mutation accounted for 9%, SCA2 for 10%, SCA3 for 42%, and SCA6 
      for 22% of German ataxia families. Seven of 27 SCA6 patients had no family 
      history of ataxia. Age at onset correlated inversely with repeat length in all 
      subtypes. Yet the average effect of one CAG unit on onset age was different for 
      each SCA subtype. We compared clinical, electrophysiological, and magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) findings to identify phenotypic characteristics of 
      genetically defined SCA subtypes. Slow saccades, hyporeflexia, myoclonus, and 
      action tremor proposed SCA2. SCA3 patients frequently developed diplopia, severe 
      spasticity or pronounced peripheral neuropathy, and impaired temperature 
      discrimination, apart from ataxia. SCA6 presented with a predominantly cerebellar 
      syndrome and patients often had onset after 55 years of age. SCA1 was 
      characterized by markedly prolonged peripheral and central motor conduction times 
      in motor evoked potentials. MRI scans showed pontine and cerebellar atrophy in 
      SCA1 and SCA2. In SCA3, enlargement of the fourth ventricle was the main sequel 
      of atrophy. SCA6 presented with pure cerebellar atrophy on MRI. However, overlap 
      between the four SCA subtypes was broad.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6: CAG repeat expansion in alpha1A voltage-dependent 
      calcium channel gene and clinical variations in Japanese population.
PG  - 879-84
AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are clinically and genetically 
      a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, mild CAG repeat 
      expansion in the alpha1A voltage-dependent calcium channel gene has been found to 
      be associated with a type of autosomal dominant SCA (SCA6). We analyzed 98 
      Japanese families with autosomal dominant SCAs, for whom CAG repeat expansions of 
      the SCA1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease/SCA3, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy genes were excluded, and 5 apparently sporadic cases of cortical 
      cerebellar atrophy. The diagnosis of SCA6 was confirmed in 30 families (31%) 
      comprising 47 affected individuals and 1 sporadic case. The size of expanded CAG 
      repeats ranged from 21 to 26 repeat units and was found to be correlated 
      inversely with age at onset. We identified 2 SCA6 patients homozygous for 
      expanded CAG repeats, whose ages at onset were earlier than the 95% lower 
      confidence level, suggesting the presence of a gene dosage effect of expanded CAG 
      repeat. Ataxia is the most common initial symptom found in 45 of the 48 patients. 
      Patients with a prolonged disease course showed other accompanying clinical 
      features including dystonic postures, involuntary movements, and abnormalities in 
      tendon reflexes.

TI  - Progressive ataxia due to a missense mutation in a calcium-channel gene.
PG  - 1078-87
AB  - We describe a family with severe progressive cerebellar ataxia involving the 
      trunk, the extremities, and speech. The proband, who has prominent atrophy of the 
      cerebellum, shown by magnetic resonance imaging, was confined to a wheelchair at 
      the age of 44 years. Two sons have episodes of vertigo and ataxia that are not 
      responsive to acetazolamide. Quantitative eye-movement testing showed a 
      consistent pattern of abnormalities localizing to the cerebellum. Genotyping 
      suggested linkage to chromosome 19p, and SSCP showed an aberrant migrating 
      fragment in exon 6 of the calcium-channel gene CACNA1A, which cosegregated with 
      the disease. Sequencing of exon 6 identified a G-->A transposition in one allele, 
      at nucleotide 1152, resulting in a predicted glycine-to-arginine substitution at 
      codon 293. The CAG-repeat expansion associated with spinocerebellar ataxia 6 was 
      not present in any family members. This family is unique in having a 
      non-CAG-repeat mutation that leads to severe progressive ataxia. Since a great 
      deal is known about the function of calcium channels, we speculate on how this 
      missense mutation leads to the combination of clinical symptoms and signs.

TI  - The expansion of the CAG repeat in ataxin-2 is a frequent cause of autosomal 
      dominant spinocerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 1009-13
AB  - The autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (ADSCAs) are a heterogeneous group 
      of late-onset neurodegenerative disorders with overlapping clinical features. 
      Genetic linkage studies have identified at least seven distinct loci for the 
      ADSCAs, allowing the genetic classification of these disorders. The 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) locus was mapped to chromosome 12, and a 
      gene responsible for this disorder was recently isolated. The mutation causing 
      SCA2 is an expansion of a trinucleotide CAG repeat contained within the coding 
      region of a novel gene. We describe the results of genotypic analysis for the 
      SCA2 repeat in individuals with ADSCA who were previously found negative for CAG 
      repeat expansions in the SCA1, SCA3, or SCA6 genes. The expanded CAG repeat has 
      been identified in 15 independent families. Repeat instability and anticipation 
      were observed in two large kindreds. The SCA2 mutation was found in 18% of our 
      ADSCA kindreds, confirming the high proportion of SCA2 among this group of 
      disorders.

TI  - Episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2) and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) due to CAG 
      repeat expansion in the CACNA1A gene on chromosome 19p.
PG  - 1973-8
AB  - Point mutations of the CACNA1A gene coding for the alpha 1A voltage-dependent 
      calcium channel subunit are responsible for familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) 
      and episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2). In addition, expansions of the CAG repeat motif 
      at the 3' end of the gene, smaller than those responsible for dynamic mutation 
      disorders, were found in patients with a progressive spinocerebellar ataxia, 
      named SCA6. In the present work, the analysis of two new families with small CAG 
      expansions of the CACNA1A gene is presented. In one family, with a clinical 
      diagnosis of EA2, a CAG23 repeat allele segregated in patients showing different 
      interictal symptoms, ranging from nystagmus only to severe progressive cerebellar 
      ataxia. No additional mutations in coding and intron-exon junction sequences in 
      disequilibrium with the CAG expansion were found. In the second family, initially 
      classified as autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia of unknown type, an 
      inter-generational allele size change showed that a CAG20 allele was associated 
      with an EA2 phenotype and a CAG25 allele with progressive cerebellar ataxia. 
      These results show that EA2 and SCA6 are the same disorder with a high phenotypic 
      variability, at least partly related to the number of repeats, and suggest that 
      the small expansions may not be as stable as previously reported. A refinement of 
      the coding and intron-exon junction sequences of the CACNA1A gene is also 
      provided.

TI  - Japanese families with autosomal dominant pure cerebellar ataxia map to 
      chromosome 19p13.1-p13.2 and are strongly associated with mild CAG expansions in 
      the spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 gene in chromosome 19p13.1.
PG  - 336-46
AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia is a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous disorders. We carried out genomewide linkage analysis in 15 
      families with autosomal dominant pure cerebellar ataxia (ADPCA). Evidence for 
      linkage to chromosome 19p markers was found in nine families, and combined 
      multipoint analysis refined the candidate region to a 13.3-cM interval in 
      19p13.1-p13.2. The remaining six families were excluded for this region. Analysis 
      of CAG-repeat expansion in the alpha1A-voltage-dependent calcium channel 
      (CACNL1A4) gene lying in 19p13.1, recently identified among 8 small American 
      kindreds with ADPCA (spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 [SCA6]), revealed that 8 of 
      the 15 families studied had similar, very small expansion in this gene: all 
      affected individuals had larger alleles (range of CAG repeats 21-25), compared 
      with alleles observed in neurologically normal Japanese (range 5-20 repeats). 
      Inverse correlation between the CAG-repeat number and the age at onset was found 
      in affected individuals with expansion. The number of CAG repeats in expanded 
      chromosomes was completely stable within each family, which was consistent with 
      the fact that anticipation was not statistically proved in the SCA6 families that 
      we studied. We conclude that more than half of Japanese cases of ADPCA map to 
      19p13.1-p13.2 and are strongly associated with the mild CAG expansion in the 
      SCA6/CACNL1A4 gene.

TI  - SCA6 is caused by moderate CAG expansion in the alpha1A-voltage-dependent calcium 
      channel gene.
PG  - 1289-93
AB  - Recently, moderate (CAG)>20 repeat expansions in the alpha1A-voltage-dependent 
      calcium channel gene (CACNL1A4) have been identified in a previously unmapped 
      type of SCA which has been named SCA6. We investigated the (CAG)n repeat length 
      of the CACNL1A4 gene in 733 patients with sporadic ataxia and in 46 German 
      families with dominantly inherited SCA which do not harbor the SCA1, SCA2, or 
      MJD1/SCA3 mutation, respectively. The SCA6 (CAG)n expansion was identified in 32 
      patients most frequently with late manifestation of the disease. The (CAG)n 
      stretch of the affected allele varied between 22 and 28 trinucleotide units and 
      is therefore the shortest trinucleotide repeat expansion causing spinocerebellar 
      ataxia. The (CAG)n repeat length is inversely correlated with the age at onset. 
      In 11 parental transmissions of the expanded allele no repeat instability has 
      been observed. Repeat instability was also not found for the normal allele 
      investigating 431 meioses in the CEPH families. Analyzing 248 apparently healthy 
      octogenerians revealed one allele of 18 repeats which is the longest normal CAG 
      repeat in the CACNL1A4 gene reported. The SCA6 mutation causes the disease in 
      approximately 10% of autosomal dominant SCA in Germany. Most importantly, the 
      trinucleotide expansion was observed in four ataxia patients without obvious 
      family history of the disease which necessitates a search for the SCA6 (CAG)n 
      expansion even in sporadic patients.

TI  - Molecular features of the CAG repeats of spinocerebellar ataxia 6 (SCA6).
PG  - 1283-7
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 6 (SCA6) is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      degeneration caused by the expansion of the polymorphic CAG repeat in the human 
      alpha1A voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit gene (CACNL1A4 gene). We have 
      analyzed 60 SCA6 individuals from 39 independent SCA6 Japanese families and found 
      that the CAG repeat length is inversely correlated with the age of onset (n = 58, 
      r = -0.51, P < 0.0001). SCA6 chromosomes contained 21-30 repeat units, whereas 
      normal chromosomes displayed 6-17 repeats. There was no overlap between the 
      normal and affected CAG repeat number. The anticipation of the disease was 
      observed clinically in all eight parent-child pairs that we examined; the mean 
      age of onset was significantly lower (P = 0.0042) in children than in parents. 
      However, a parent-child analysis showed the increase in the expansion of CAG 
      repeats only in one pair and no diminution in any affected cases. This result 
      suggests that factors other than CAG repeats may produce the clinical 
      anticipation. A homozygotic case could not demonstrate an unequivocal gene dosage 
      effect on the age of onset.

TI  - Estimated contribution of known ataxia genes in ataxia patients undergoing DNA 
      testing.
PG  - 275-8
AB  - We estimated the relative contributions of known ataxia genes (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 
      and X25) in the patient population sent to our DNA diagnostic laboratory for 
      diagnostic testing. Approximately 28% of these patients had an abnormal triplet 
      repeat expansion in one of these ataxia genes (3% for SCA1, 8% for SCA2, 11% for 
      SCA3/MJD, 2% for SCA6, 3% for SCA7, and 1.5% for X25). The lack of abnormal 
      repeat expansions in the majority of ataxis patients tested suggests that the 
      molecular defects associated with most ataxia cases are currently undetermined 
      and that this population includes both familial and sporadic cases. In contrast, 
      of the patients submitted for genetic testing for Friedrich's ataxia (FRDA), 44% 
      (69/157) showed at least one expansion in the X25 gene, indicating that FRDA 
      accounts for a significant proportion of the recessively inherited ataxias and 
      appears to have a high rate of accurate clinical diagnosis. On the basis of our 
      DNA studies, we propose a comprehensive and efficient approach for molecular 
      analysis of ataxia patients.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (SCA6) associated with small polyglutamine 
      expansions in the alpha 1A-voltage-dependent calcium channel.
PG  - 62-9
AB  - A polymorphic CAG repeat was identified in the human alpha 1A voltage-dependent 
      calcium channel subunit. To test the hypothesis that expansion of this CAG repeat 
      could be the cause of an inherited progressive ataxia, we genotyped a large 
      number of unrelated controls and ataxia patients. Eight unrelated patients with 
      late onset ataxia had alleles with larger repeat numbers (21-27) compared to the 
      number of repeats (4-16) in 475 non-ataxia individuals. Analysis of the repeat 
      length in families of the affected individuals revealed that the expansion 
      segregated with the phenotype in every patient. We identified six isoforms of the 
      human alpha 1A calcium channel subunit. The CAG repeat is within the open reading 
      frame and is predicted to encode glutamine in three of the isoforms. We conclude 
      that a small polyglutamine expansion in the human alpha 1A calcium channel is 
      most likely the cause of a newly classified autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      ataxia, SCA6.

TI  - A 3-Mb region for the familial hemiplegic migraine locus on 19p13.1-p13.2: 
      exclusion of PRKCSH as a candidate gene. Dutch Migraine Genetic Research Group.
PG  - 321-8
AB  - Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is an autosomal domianant subtype of migraine 
      with attacks, associated with transient episodes of hemiparesis. One of the genes 
      for FHM has been assigned to chromosome 19p13. Detailed analysis of critical 
      recombinants from two different chromosome 19-linked FHM families, using new 
      markers indicated a 6-cM candidate region on 19p13.1-p13.2 flanked by loci 
      D19S394 and D19S226. Another paroxysmal neurological disorder, episodic ataxia 
      type 2 (EA-2), has also been linked to the same chromosomal region. Most of the 
      interval was completely covered by YAC and cosmid contigs; the physical map 
      yielded approximately 3 Mb encompassing several genes including the protein 
      kinase substrate 80K-H (PRKCSH) gene. Since PRKCSH is involved in neuronal signal 
      transduction, it was considered to be an FHM candidate gene. The genomic 
      structure of this gene was established and mutation analysis for all exon and 
      flanking intron sequences was performed in FHM- and EA-2-affected individuals. 
      Five polymorphisms were identified, including a trinucleotide repeat length 
      variation in the coding sequence. However, no potential disease causing mutation 
      was found and therefore the PRKCSH gene can be excluded for both FHM and EA-2.
