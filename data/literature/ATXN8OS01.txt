AB  - There is an obvious clinical-pathological overlap between essential tremor and 
      some known tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansion disorders. The aim is 
      to analyse whether these short tandem repeat genes, including ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, TBP, BEAN1, NOP56, DAB1, ATN1, 
      SADM12 and FMR1, are associated with familial essential tremor patients. Genetic 
      analysis of repeat sizes in tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansions was 
      performed in a large cohort of 515 familial essential tremor probands and 300 
      controls. The demographic and clinical features among carriers of pathogenic 
      expansions, intermediate repeats and non-carriers were compared. A total of 18 
      out of 515 (18/515, 3.7%) patients were found to have repeats expansions, 
      including 12 cases (12/515, 2.5%) with intermediate repeat expansions (one ATXN1, 
      eight TBP, two FMR1, one ATN1), and six cases (6/515, 1.2%) with pathogenic 
      expansions (one ATXN1, one ATXN2, one ATXN8OS, one PPP2R2B, one FMR1, one 
      SAMD12). There were no statistically significant differences in intermediate 
      repeats compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, there were no significant 
      differences in demographics and clinical features among individuals with 
      pathogenic expansions, intermediate repeat expansions carriers and non-carriers. 
      Our study indicates that the intermediate repeat expansion in tremor-associated 
      short tandem repeat expansions does not pose an increased risk for essential 
      tremor, and rare pathogenic expansion carriers have been found in the familial 
      essential tremor cohort. The diagnosis of essential tremor based solely on 
      clinical symptoms remains a challenge in distinguishing it from known short 
      tandem repeat expansions diseases with overlapping clinical-pathological 
      features.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) is a neurological disease characterized by 
      action tremor in upper arms. Although its high heritability and prevalence 
      worldwide, its etiology and association with other diseases are still unknown. 
      METHOD: We investigated 10 common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), including SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, SCA36, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA) in 92 early-onset familial ET pedigrees in China collected from 
      2016 to 2022. RESULT: We found one SCA12 proband carried 51 CAG repeats within 
      PPP2R2B gene and one SCA3 proband with intermediate CAG repeats (55) with ATXN3 
      gene. The other 90 ET probands all had normal repeat expansions. CONCLUSION: 
      Tremor can be the initial phenotype of certain SCA. For early-onset, familial ET 
      patients, careful physical examinations are needed before genetic SCA screening.

AB  - The Cerebellar Cognitive Affective/Schmahmann Syndrome (CCAS) manifests as 
      impaired executive control, linguistic processing, visual spatial function, and 
      affect regulation. The CCAS has been described in the spinocerebellar ataxias 
      (SCAs), but its prevalence is unknown. We analyzed results of the CCAS/Schmahmann 
      Scale (CCAS-S), developed to detect and quantify CCAS, in two natural history 
      studies of 309 individuals Symptomatic for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, or SCA8, 
      26 individuals Pre-symptomatic for SCA1 or SCA3, and 37 Controls. We compared 
      total raw scores, domain scores, and total fail scores between Symptomatic, 
      Pre-symptomatic, and Control cohorts, and between SCA types. We calculated scale 
      sensitivity and selectivity based on CCAS category designation among Symptomatic 
      individuals and Controls, and correlated CCAS-S performance against age and 
      education, and in Symptomatic patients, against genetic repeat length, onset age, 
      disease duration, motor ataxia, depression, and fatigue. Definite CCAS was 
      identified in 46% of the Symptomatic group. False positive rate among Controls 
      was 5.4%. Symptomatic individuals had poorer global CCAS-S performance than 
      Controls, accounting for age and education. The domains of semantic fluency, 
      phonemic fluency, and category switching that tap executive function and 
      linguistic processing consistently separated Symptomatic individuals from 
      Controls. CCAS-S scores correlated most closely with motor ataxia. Controls were 
      similar to Pre-symptomatic individuals whose nearness to symptom onset was 
      unknown. The use of the CCAS-S identifies a high CCAS prevalence in a large 
      cohort of SCA patients, underscoring the utility of the scale and the notion that 
      the CCAS is the third cornerstone of clinical ataxiology.

      cerebellar atrophy, and prolonged alcohol use are a few possible causes. In a 
      group of people with sporadic cerebellar ataxia that was not MSA-C, an 
      autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) mutation was recently discovered. 
      Chinese single-hospital cohort will be used in this study to genetic screen for 
      SCA-related genes. One hundred forty individuals with CA were monitored over 8 
      years. Thirty-one individuals had familial CA, 109 patients had sporadic CA, 73 
      had MSA-C, and 36 had non-MSA-C sporadic CA. In 28 of the 31 non-MSA-C sporadic 
      patients who requested the test, we carried out gene analysis, including SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, SCA31, and 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The control group consisted of 
      family members of the patients. In 57% of the instances with spontaneous CA that 
      were not MSA-C, gene abnormalities were discovered. The most frequent exception 
      among individuals with sporadic CA was SCA6 (36%), followed by monsters in SCA1, 
      2, 3, 8, and DRPLA. In contrast, 75% of the patients with familial CA had gene 
      abnormalities, the most frequent of which was SCA6 abnormality. The age of 69 vs 
      59 was higher, and the CAG repeat length was a minor age of 23 vs 25 in the 
      former instances compared to the last one among individuals with SCA6 anomalies 
      that were sporadic as opposed to familial cases. In sporadic CA, 
      autosomal-dominant mutations in SCA genes, notably in SCA6, are common. Although 
      the cause of the increased incidence of SCA6 mutations is unknown, it may be 
      related to a greater age of onset and varied penetrance of SCA6 mutations.

TI  - The Frequency of Intermediate Alleles in Patients with Cerebellar Phenotypes.
PG  - 1135-1145
LID - 10.1007/s12311-023-01620-7 [doi]
AB  - Cerebellar syndromes are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and can be 
      classified as hereditary, neurodegenerative non-hereditary, or acquired. Few data 
      are available on the frequency of each form in the clinical setting. Growing 
      interest is emerging regarding the genetic forms caused by triplet repeat 
      expansions. Alleles with repeat expansion lower than the pathological threshold, 
      termed intermediate alleles (IAs), have been found to be associated with disease 
      manifestation. In order to assess the relevance of IAs as a cause of cerebellar 
      syndromes, we enrolled 66 unrelated Italian ataxic patients and described the 
      distribution of the different etiology of their syndromes and the frequency of 
      IAs. Each patient underwent complete clinical, hematological, and 
      neurophysiological assessments, neuroimaging evaluations, and genetic tests for 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (SCA) and fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia 
      syndrome (FXTAS). We identified the following diagnostic categories: 28% sporadic 
      adult-onset ataxia, 18% cerebellar variant of multiple system atrophy, 9% 
      acquired forms, 9% genetic forms with full-range expansion, and 12% cases with 
      intermediate-range expansion. The IAs were six in the FMR1 gene, two in the gene 
      responsible for SCA8, and one in the ATXN2 gene. The clinical phenotype of 
      patients carrying the IAs resembles, in most of the cases, the one associated 
      with full-range expansion. Our study provides an exhaustive description of the 
      causes of cerebellar ataxia, estimating for the first time the frequency of IAs 
      in SCAs- and FXTAS-associated genes. The high percentage of cases with IAs 
      supports further screening among patients with cerebellar syndromes.

TI  - Prevalence of repeat expansions causing autosomal dominant spinocerebellar 
      ataxias in Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan.

AB  - In Japan, approximately 30% of spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) is hereditary, 
      and more than 90% of hereditary SCD is autosomal dominant SCD (AD-SCD). We have 
      previously reported the types of AD-SCD in Hokkaido, twice. In this study, we 
      investigated the status of AD-SCD mainly due to repeat expansions, covering the 
      period since the last report. We performed genetic analysis for 312 patients with 
      a clinical diagnosis of SCD, except for multiple system atrophy at medical 
      institutions in Hokkaido between January 2007 and December 2020. The median age 
      at the time of analysis was 58 (1-86) years. Pathogenic variants causing AD-SCD 
      due to repeat expansion were found in 61.5% (192 cases). Spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) 6 was the most common type in 25.3% (79 cases), followed by Machado-Joseph 
      disease (MJD)/SCA3 in 13.8% (43), SCA1 in 6.4% (20), SCA2 in 5.1% (16), SCA31 in 
      4.8% (15), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy in 4.8% (15), SCA7 in 0.6% (2), 
      and SCA8 in 0.6% (2). SCA17, 27B, 36, and 37 were not found. Compared to previous 
      reports, this study found a higher prevalence of SCA6 and a lower prevalence of 
      MJD/SCA3. An increasing number of cases identified by genetic testing, including 
      cases with no apparent family history, accurately revealed the distribution of 
      disease types in Hokkaido.

AB  - Pathogenic short tandem repeat (STR) expansions cause over 20 neurodegenerative 
      diseases. To determine the contribution of STRs in sporadic amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), we used ExpansionHunter, 
      REviewer, and polymerase chain reaction validation to assess 21 neurodegenerative 
      disease-associated STRs in whole-genome sequencing data from 608 patients with 
      sporadic ALS, 68 patients with sporadic FTD, and 4703 matched controls. We also 
      propose a data-derived outlier detection method for defining allele thresholds in 
      rare STRs. Excluding C9orf72 repeat expansions, 17.6% of clinically diagnosed ALS 
      and FTD cases had at least one expanded STR allele reported to be pathogenic or 
      intermediate for another neurodegenerative disease. We identified and validated 
      162 disease-relevant STR expansions in C9orf72 (ALS/FTD), ATXN1 [spinal 
      cerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1)], ATXN2 (SCA2), ATXN8 (SCA8), TBP (SCA17), HTT 
      (Huntington's disease), DMPK [myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)], CNBP (DM2), and 
      FMR1 (fragile-X disorders). Our findings suggest clinical and pathological 
      pleiotropy of neurodegenerative disease genes and highlight their importance in 
      ALS and FTD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Plasma neurofilament light (NfL), glial fibrillary 
      acidic protein (GFAP), phosphorylated-tau (p-tau), and beta-amyloid (Abeta) have 
      emerged as promising markers in several neurodegenerative disorders, but whether 
      they can be used as biomarkers in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) is yet to be 
      determined. This study aimed to identify sensitive plasma markers for SCA and 
      investigate their effectiveness in tracking ataxia severity, cognition, non-motor 
      symptoms, and brain atrophy. METHODS: This observational study recruited 
      consecutive participants from Huashan Hospital and the CABLE study from November 
      2019. Patients with SCA were genetically diagnosed, grouped according to the 
      ataxia severity, and compared with healthy older individuals and patients with 
      multiple system atrophy type C (MSA-C). Plasma NfL, GFAP, p-tau, and Abeta levels 
      were measured by Simoa in all participants. Analysis of covariance, Spearman 
      correlation, and multivariable regression were used to explore candidate markers 
      in SCA. RESULTS: A total of 190 participants (60 SCA, 56 MSA-C, and 74 healthy 
      controls) were enrolled. Plasma NfL level increased early in the pre-ataxic stage 
      of SCA (32.23 +/- 3.07 vs. 11.41 +/- 6.62 pg/mL in controls), was positively 
      associated with the ataxia severity (r = 0.45, P = 0.005) and CAG repeat length 
      (r = 0.51, P = 0.001), varied among the different SCA subtypes 
      (39.57 +/- 13.50 pg/mL in SCA3, which was higher than 28.17 +/- 8.02 pg/mL in SCA2, 
      17.08 +/- 6.78 pg/mL in SCA8, and 24.44 +/- 18.97 pg/mL in rare SCAs; P < 0.05), and 
      was associated with brainstem atrophy. NfL alone (area under the curve [AUC] 
      0.867) or combined with p-tau181 and Abeta (AUC 0.929), showed excellent performance 
      in discriminating SCA patients from controls. Plasma GFAP distinguished SCA from 
      MSA-C with moderate accuracy (AUC > 0.700) and correlated with cognitive 
      performance and cortical atrophy. Changes in levels of p-tau181 and Abeta were 
      observed in SCA patients compared to controls. They were both correlated with 
      cognition, while Abeta was also associated with non-motor symptoms, such as anxiety 
      and depression. DISCUSSION: Plasma NfL may serve as a sensitive biomarker for 
      SCA, and its level is elevated in the pre-ataxic stage. The different performance 
      of NfL and GFAP indicates differences in the underlying neuropathology of SCA and 
      MSA-C. Moreover, amyloid markers may be useful for detecting memory dysfunction 
      and other non-motor symptoms in SCA.

TI  - Neuropathology of spinocerebellar ataxia type 8: Common features and unique 
      tauopathy.
PG  - 351-361
LID - 10.1111/neup.12894 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a neurodegenerative condition that 
      presents with several neurological symptoms, such as cerebellar ataxia, 
      parkinsonism, and cognitive impairment. It is caused by a CTA/CTG repeat 
      expansion on chromosome 13q21 (ataxin 8 opposite strand [ATXN8OS]). However, the 
      pathological significance of this expansion remains unclear. Moreover, abnormal 
      CTA/CTG repeat expansions in ATXN8OS have also been reported in other 
      neurodegenerative diseases, including progressive supranuclear palsy. In this 
      study, we analyzed all available autopsy cases in Japan to investigate common 
      pathological features and profiles of tau pathology in each case. Severe neuronal 
      loss in the substantia nigra and prominent loss of Purkinje cells, atrophy of the 
      molecular layer, and proliferation of Bergmann glia in the cerebellum were common 
      features. Regarding tauopathy, one case presented with progressive supranuclear 
      palsy-like 4-repeat tauopathy in addition to mild Alzheimer-type 3- and 4-repeat 
      tauopathy. Another case showed 3- and 4-repeat tauopathy accentuated in the 
      brainstem. The other two cases lacked tauopathy after extensive 
      immunohistochemical studies. The present study confirmed common pathological 
      features of SCA8 as degeneration of the substantia nigra in addition to the 
      cerebellum. Our study also confirmed unique tauopathy in two of four cases, 
      indicating the necessity to further collect autopsy cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic efficacy of clinical 
      exome-targeted sequencing (CES) and spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36) screening 
      in a real-life cohort of patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) from Eastern Spain. 
      METHODS: A total of 130 unrelated patients with CA, negative for common 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, 
      SCA17, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA], and Friedreich ataxia), were 
      studied with CES. Bioinformatic and genotype-phenotype analyses were performed to 
      assess the pathogenicity of the variants encountered. Copy number variants were 
      analyzed when appropriate. In undiagnosed dominant and sporadic cases, repeat 
      primed PCR was used to screen for the presence of a repeat expansion in the NOP56 
      gene. RESULTS: CES identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 50 
      families (39%), including 23 novel variants. Overall, there was a high genetic 
      heterogeneity, and the most frequent genetic diagnosis was SPG7 (n = 15), 
      followed by SETX (n = 6), CACNA1A (n = 5), POLR3A (n = 4), and SYNE1 (n = 3). In 
      addition, 17 families displayed likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants in 14 
      different genes: KCND3 (n = 2), KIF1C (n = 2), CYP27A1A (n = 2), AFG3L2 (n = 1), 
      ANO10 (n = 1), CAPN1 (n = 1), CWF19L1 (n = 1), ITPR1 (n = 1), KCNA1 (n = 1), OPA1 
      (n = 1), PNPLA6 (n = 1), SPG11 (n = 1), SPTBN2 (n = 1), and TPP1 (n = 1). 
      Twenty-two novel variants were characterized. SCA36 was diagnosed in 11 families, 
      all with autosomal dominant (AD) presentation. SCA36 screening increased the 
      total diagnostic rate to 47% (n = 61/130). Ultimately, undiagnosed patients 
      showed delayed age at onset (p < 0.05) and were more frequently sporadic. 
      DISCUSSION: Our study provides insight into the genetic landscape of CA in 
      Eastern Spain. Although CES was an effective approach to capture genetic 
      heterogeneity, most patients remained undiagnosed. SCA36 was found to be a 
      relatively frequent form and, therefore, should be tested prior to CES in 
      familial AD presentations in particular geographical regions.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8), a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by a CTG*CAG expansion, is unusual because most individuals that 
      carry the mutation do not develop ataxia. To understand the variable penetrance 
      of SCA8, we studied the molecular differences between highly penetrant families 
      and more common sporadic cases (82%) using a large cohort of SCA8 families 
      (n = 77). We show that repeat expansion mutations from individuals with multiple 
      affected family members have CCG*CGG interruptions at a higher frequency than 
      sporadic SCA8 cases and that the number of CCG*CGG interruptions correlates with 
      age at onset. At the molecular level, CCG*CGG interruptions increase RNA hairpin 
      stability, and in cell culture experiments, increase p-eIF2alpha and polyAla and 
      polySer RAN protein levels. Additionally, CCG*CGG interruptions, which encode 
      arginine interruptions in the polyGln frame, increase toxicity of the resulting 
      proteins. In summary, SCA8 CCG*CGG interruptions increase polyAla and polySer RAN 
      protein levels, polyGln protein toxicity, and disease penetrance and provide 
      novel insight into the molecular differences between SCA8 families with high vs. 
      low disease penetrance.

AB  - Epilepsies are a group of common neurological disorders with a substantial 
      genetic basis. Despite this, the molecular diagnosis of epilepsies remains 
      challenging due to its heterogeneity. Studies utilizing whole-genome sequencing 
      may provide additional insights into genetic causes of epilepsies of unknown 
      aetiology. Whole-genome sequencing was used to evaluate a cohort of adults with 
      unexplained developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (n = 30), for whom prior 
      genetic tests, including whole-exome sequencing in some cases, were negative or 
      inconclusive. Rare single nucleotide variants, insertions/deletions, copy number 
      variants and tandem repeat expansions were analysed. Seven pathogenic or likely 
      pathogenic single nucleotide variants, and two pathogenic deleterious copy number 
      variants were identified in nine patients (32.1% of the cohort). One of the copy 
      number variants, identified in a patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, was too 
      small to be detected by chromosomal microarray techniques. We also identified two 
      tandem repeat expansions with clinical implications in two other patients with 
      Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: a CGG repeat expansion in the 5'untranslated region of 
      DIP2B, and a CTG expansion in ATXN8OS (previously implicated in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 8). Three patients had KCNA2 pathogenic variants. One of them died of 
      sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. The other two patients had, in addition to a 
      KCNA2 variant, a second de novo variant impacting potential epilepsy-relevant 
      genes (KCNIP4 and UBR5). Overall, whole-genome sequencing provided a genetic 
      explanation in 32.1% of the total cohort. This is also the first report of coding 
      and non-coding tandem repeat expansions identified in patients with 
      Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This study demonstrates that using whole-genome 
      sequencing, the examination of multiple types of rare genetic variation, 
      including those found in the non-coding region of the genome, can help resolve 
      unexplained epilepsies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetics of cerebellar ataxia is complex. Hundreds of causative 
      genes have been identified, but only a few cause more than single cases. The 
      spectrum of ataxia-causing genes differs considerably between populations. The 
      aim of the study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of ataxia in the 
      Finnish population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients in hospital database were 
      reviewed for the diagnosis of unspecified ataxia. Acquired ataxias and nongenetic 
      ataxias such as those related to infection, trauma or stroke were excluded. Sixty 
      patients with sporadic ataxia with unknown etiology and 36 patients with familial 
      ataxia of unknown etiology were recruited in the study. Repeat expansions in the 
      SCA genes (ATXN1, 2, 3, 7, 8/OS, CACNA1A, TBP), FXN, and RFC1 were determined. 
      Point mutations in POLG, SPG7 and in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were investigated. 
      In addition, DNA from 8 patients was exome sequenced. RESULTS: A genetic cause of 
      ataxia was found in 33 patients (34.4%). Seven patients had a dominantly 
      inherited repeat expansion in ATXN8/OS. Ten patients had mitochondrial ataxia 
      resulting from mutations in nuclear mitochondrial genes POLG or RARS2, or from a 
      point mutation m.8561C > G or a single deletion in mtDNA. Interestingly, five 
      patients were biallelic for the recently identified pathogenic repeat expansion 
      in RFC1. All the five patients presented with the phenotype of cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia (CANVAS). Moreover, screening of 54 patients 
      with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy revealed four additional patients with 
      biallelic repeat expansion in RFC1, but none of them had cerebellar symptoms. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Expansion in ATXN8/OS results in the majority of dominant ataxias in 
      Finland, while mutations in RFC1 and POLG are the most common cause of recessive 
      ataxias. Our results suggest that analysis of RFC1 should be included in the 
      routine diagnostics of idiopathic ataxia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth polyneuropathy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hereditary ataxias demonstrate a high degree of clinical and 
      genetic heterogeneity. Understanding the genetic etiology of hereditary ataxias 
      is crucial for genetic counseling and clinical management. METHODS: The clinical 
      and genetic data of patients with familial or sporadic ataxias who referred to 
      our tertiary medical center were retrospectively analyzed. Probands in this study 
      underwent SCA repeat expansion panel firstly to screen for repeat expansion SCAs; 
      those with negative results had NGS-targeted panels or WES testing to detect 
      conventional mutations. RESULTS: A total of 223 patients were enrolled from 206 
      families. 5 kinds of coexisting SCA repeat expansions were observed (SCA3/SCA17, 
      SCA3/SCA8, SCA2/SCA8, SCA3/SCA12 and SCA8/SCA12) in 12 patients from 8 families, 
      among which SCA2/SCA8, SCA8/SCA12 and SCA3/SCA12 were reported for the first 
      time. The coexistence of expanded SCA3 with SCA17 alleles was the most common in 
      our study. NGS identified pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 12 ataxia 
      causative genes in 13 probands. Spastic paraplegia ataxia was the most common 
      diagnosis. Six novel mutations were detected in five ataxia-related genes. 
      CONCLUSION: Coexistence may not specific to a certain SCA subtype and the 
      frequency might have been underestimated before. SCA repeat expansion panel 
      should be considered in patients with overlapping SCA features. In addition, our 
      study broadened the conventional mutation spectrum in ataxia-related genes. These 
      results facilitate a better understanding of the genetic basis for hereditary 
      ataxias.

AB  - The range of genetic variation with potential clinical implications in 
      schizophrenia, beyond rare copy number variants (CNVs), remains uncertain. We 
      therefore analyzed genome sequencing data for 259 unrelated adults with 
      schizophrenia from a well-characterized community-based cohort previously 
      examined with chromosomal microarray for CNVs (none with 22q11.2 deletions). We 
      analyzed these genomes for rare high-impact variants considered causal for 
      neurodevelopmental disorders, including single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 
      small insertions/deletions (indels), for potential clinical relevance based on 
      findings for neurodevelopmental disorders. Also, we investigated a novel variant 
      type, tandem repeat expansions (TREs), in 45 loci known to be associated with 
      monogenic neurological diseases. We found several of these variants in this 
      schizophrenia population suggesting that these variants have a wider clinical 
      spectrum than previously thought. In addition to known pathogenic CNVs, we 
      identified 11 (4.3%) individuals with clinically relevant SNVs/indels in genes 
      converging on schizophrenia-relevant pathways. Clinical yield was significantly 
      enriched in females and in those with broadly defined learning/intellectual 
      disabilities. Genome analyses also identified variants with potential clinical 
      implications, including TREs (one in DMPK; two in ATXN8OS) and ultra-rare 
      loss-of-function SNVs in ZMYM2 (a novel candidate gene for schizophrenia). Of the 
      233 individuals with no pathogenic CNVs, we identified rare high-impact variants 
      (i.e., clinically relevant or with potential clinical implications) for 14 
      individuals (6.0%); some had multiple rare high-impact variants. Mean 
      schizophrenia polygenic risk score was similar between individuals with and 
      without clinically relevant rare genetic variation; common variants were not 
      sufficient for clinical application. These findings broaden the individual and 
      global picture of clinically relevant genetic risk in schizophrenia, and suggest 
      the potential translational value of genome sequencing as a single genetic 
      technology for schizophrenia.

PG  - 117-125

AB  - PURPOSE: Investigate single nucleotide variants and short tandem repeats in 39 
      genes related to spinocerebellar ataxia in clinical and pathologically defined 
      cohorts of multiple system atrophy. METHODS: Exome sequencing was conducted in 28 
      clinical multiple system atrophy patients to identify single nucleotide variants 
      in spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes. Novel variants were validated in two 
      independent disease cohorts: 86 clinically diagnosed multiple system atrophy 
      patients and 166 pathological multiple system atrophy cases. Expanded repeat 
      alleles in spinocerebellar ataxia genes were evaluated in 36 clinically diagnosed 
      multiple system atrophy patients, and CAG/CAA repeats in TATA-Box Binding Protein 
      (TBP, causative of SCA17) were screened in 216 clinical and pathological multiple 
      system atrophy patients and 346 controls. RESULTS: No known pathogenic 
      spinocerebellar ataxia single nucleotide variants or pathogenic range expanded 
      repeat alleles of ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, AXTN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, 
      and TBP were detected in any clinical multiple system atrophy patients. However, 
      four novel variants were identified in four spinocerebellar ataxia-related genes 
      across three multiple system atrophy patients. Additionally, four multiple system 
      atrophy patients (1.6%) and one control (0.3%) carried an intermediate length 41 
      TBP CAG/CAA repeat allele (OR = 4.11, P = 0.21). There was a significant 
      association between the occurrence of a repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) and an increased risk of multiple system atrophy (OR = 1.64, P = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: Occurrence of TBP CAG/CAA repeat length of longer alleles (> 38 
      repeats) is significantly associated with increased multiple system atrophy risk. 
      This discovery warrants further investigation and supports a possible genetic 
      overlap of multiple system atrophy with SCA17.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a rare autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by CTA/CTG repeat expansion in the ATXN8/ATXN8OS 
      gene. METHODS: To analyze the frequency and clinical characteristics of SCA8 
      patients in mainland China, we combined polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 
      triplet repeat-primed PCR (TRP-PCR) to detect the CTA/CTG expansion. We studied a 
      cohort of 362 ataxia patients in which the other known causative genes had been 
      previously excluded, from among 1294 index patients. Positive samples were 
      validated by southern blotting. RESULTS: The CTA/CTG expansion was observed in 
      six probands, accounting for approximately 0.46% (6/1294) in all patients, and 
      1.66% (6/362) in patients without definite molecular diagnosis. Clinically, aside 
      from the typical SCA8 phenotype, some patients carrying the CTA/CTG expansion 
      exhibited the cerebellar form of multisystem atrophy (MSA-C) and ataxia with 
      paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD). CONCLUSION: For the first time, we 
      described the PKD phenotype in association with CTA/CTG expansion, suggesting 
      that CTA/CTG expansion might play a role in the pathogenesis of paroxysmal 
      dyskinesia symptoms.

      gene.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the contribution of noncoding repeat expansions in Japanese 
      patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). METHODS: Sporadic ALS in 
      Western countries is frequently associated with noncoding repeat expansions in 
      the C9ORF72 gene. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is another noncoding 
      repeat disease caused by expanded CTA/CTG repeats in the ATXN8OS gene. Although 
      the involvement of upper and lower motor neurons in SCA8 has been reported, a 
      positive association between SCA8 and ALS remains unestablished. Spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 36 is a recently identified disease caused by noncoding repeat 
      expansions in the NOP56 gene and is characterized by motor neuron involvement. We 
      collected blood samples from 102 Japanese patients with sporadic ALS and analyzed 
      the ATXN8OS gene by the PCR-Sanger sequencing method and the C9ORF72 and NOP56 
      genes by repeat-primed PCR assay. RESULTS: Three patients with ALS (3%) had 
      mutations in the ATXN8OS gene, whereas no patient had a mutation in the C9ORF72 
      or NOP56 gene. The mutation-positive patients were clinically characterized by 
      neck weakness or bulbar-predominant symptoms. None of our patients had apparent 
      cerebellar atrophy on MRI, but 2 had nonsymptomatic abnormalities in the white 
      matter or putamen. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding reveals the importance of noncoding 
      repeat expansions in Japanese patients with ALS and extends the clinical 
      phenotype of SCA8. Three percent seems small but is still relatively large for 
      Japan, considering that the most commonly mutated genes, including the SOD1 and 
      SQSTM1 genes, only account for 2%-3% of sporadic patients each.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a rare autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by expanded CTA/CTG repeats in the ATXN8OS gene. 
      Many patients had pure cerebellar ataxia, while some had parkinsonism, both 
      without causal explanation. We analyzed the ATXN8OS gene in 150 Japanese patients 
      with ataxia and 76 patients with Parkinson's disease or related disorders. We 
      systematically reassessed 123 patients with SCA8, both our patients and those 
      reported in other studies. Two patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) 
      had mutations in the ATXN8OS gene. Systematic analyses revealed that patients 
      with parkinsonism had significantly shorter CTA/CTG repeat expansions and older 
      age at onset than those with predominant ataxia. We show the imaging results of 
      patients with and without parkinsonism. We also found a significant inverse 
      relationship between repeat sizes and age at onset in all patients, which has not 
      been detected previously. Our results may be useful to genetic counseling, 
      improve understanding of the pathomechanism, and extend the clinical phenotype of 
      SCA8.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) subtypes are often caused by expansions 
      in non-coding regions of genes like SCA8, SCA10, SCA12 and SCA36. Other ataxias 
      are known to be associated with repeat expansions such as fragile X-associated 
      tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) or expansions in the C9orf72 gene. When no 
      mutation has been identified in the aforementioned genes next-generation 
      sequencing (NGS)-based diagnostics may also be applied. In order to define an 
      optimal diagnostic strategy, more information about the frequency and phenotypic 
      characteristics of rare repeat expansion disorders associated with ataxia should 
      be at hand. METHODS: We analyzed a consecutive cohort of 440 German unrelated 
      patients with symptoms of cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria and other unspecific 
      symptoms who were referred to our center for SCA diagnostics. They showed alleles 
      in the normal range for the most common SCA subtypes SCA1-3, SCA6, SCA7 and 
      SCA17. These patients were screened for expansions causing SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA36 and FXTAS as well as for the pathogenic hexanucleotide repeat in the 
      C9orf72 gene. RESULTS: Expanded repeats for SCA10, SCA12 or SCA36 were not 
      identified in the analyzed patients. Five patients showed expanded SCA8 CTA/CTG 
      alleles with 92-129 repeats. One 51-year-old male with unclear dementia symptoms 
      was diagnosed with a large GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72. The analysis of 
      the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) revealed one patient with a 
      premutation (>50 CGG repeats) and seven patients with alleles in the grey zone 
      (41 to 54 CGG repeats). CONCLUSIONS: Altogether five patients showed 92 or more 
      SCA8 CTA/CTG combined repeats. Our results support the assumption that smaller 
      FMR1 gene expansions could be associated with the risk of developing neurological 
      signs. The results do not support genetic testing for C9orf72 expansion in ataxia 
      patients.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8), an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative 
      disorder showing slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, is caused by a 
      tri-nucleotide CTG repeat expansion (CTGexp) in the SCA8 gene. As the CTGexp is 
      not fully penetrant, the significance of screening CTGexp in ataxia subjects 
      remains obscure. We tested SCA8 CTGexp in a cohort of 797 ataxia subjects, and if 
      present, its sequence configuration was analyzed. CTGexp was found in 16 alleles 
      from 14 individuals, 2 of which was homozygous for CTGexp. Nucleotide sequencing 
      disclosed 3 types of CTGexp sequence configurations: uninterrupted CTGexp, 
      tri-nucleotide CTA interruption and CCG interruption. The 2 individuals with 
      homozygous expansions were both sporadic cases with clinical features compatible 
      with SCA8, supporting gene dosage effect. Seven out of 14 CTGexp-positive 
      subjects were also carriers of other SCA expansions [Machado-Joseph disease 
      (n=1), SCA6 (n=3) and SCA31 (n=3)], whereas 7 others were not complicated with 
      such major SCAs. Ages of onset in subjects with pure CTGexp tended to be earlier 
      than those with interrupted CTGexp among the 7 subjects not complicated by major 
      SCAs, suggesting that pure CTGexp have stronger pathogenic effect than 
      interrupted CTGexps. The present study underscores importance of disclosing 
      sequence configuration when testing SCA8.

TI  - Genetic Screening for Spinocerebellar Ataxia Genes in a Japanese Single-Hospital 
      Cohort.
PG  - 116-122
LID - 10.14802/jmd.17011 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diagnosis of sporadic cerebellar ataxia is a challenge for 
      neurologists. A wide range of potential causes exist, including chronic alcohol 
      use, multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type (MSA-C), and sporadic late 
      cortical cerebellar atrophy. Recently, an autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) mutation was identified in a cohort of patients with non-MSA-C 
      sporadic cerebellar ataxia. The aim of this study is to genetically screen genes 
      involved in SCA in a Japanese single-hospital cohort. METHODS: Over an 8-year 
      period, 140 patients with cerebellar ataxia were observed. There were 109 
      patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia (no family history for at least four 
      generations, 73 patients with MSA-C, and 36 patients with non-MSA-C sporadic 
      cerebellar ataxia) and 31 patients with familial cerebellar ataxia. We performed 
      gene analysis comprising SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, 17, 31, and 
      dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) in 28 of 31 non-MSA-C sporadic 
      patients who requested the test. Familial patients served as a control. RESULTS: 
      Gene abnormalities were found in 57% of non-MSA-C sporadic cerebellar ataxia 
      cases. Among patients with sporadic cerebellar ataxia, abnormalities in SCA6 were 
      the most common (36%), followed by abnormalities in SCA1 (7.1%), SCA2 (3.6%), 
      SCA3 (3.6%), SCA8 (3.6%), and DRPLA (3.6%). In contrast, gene abnormalities were 
      found in 75% of familial cerebellar ataxia cases, with abnormalities in SCA6 
      being the most common (29%). For sporadic versus familial cases for those with 
      SCA6 abnormalities, the age of onset was older (69 years vs. 59 years, 
      respectively), and CAG repeat length was shorter (23 vs. 25, respectively) in the 
      former than in the latter (not statistically significant). CONCLUSION: 
      Autosomal-dominant mutations in SCA genes, particularly in SCA6, are not rare in 
      sporadic cerebellar ataxia. The reason for the frequency of mutations in SCA6 
      remains unclear; however, the reason may reflect a higher age at onset and 
      variable penetrance of SCA6 mutations.

TI  - Analysis of a fully penetrant spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 Brazilian family.
PG  - 541-545
LID - 10.1111/ane.12744 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a progressive neurological disorder 
      caused by the expanded repeat CTA/CTG of two overlapping genes, ATXN8OS and 
      ATXN8, expressed bidirectionally. Normal alleles have 15-50 repeats, and 
      pathogenic alleles range from 71 to 1300 repeats. The disorder is relatively 
      rare, accounting for about 2%-5% of the autosomal dominant forms of hereditary 
      ataxia worldwide. However, the prevalence of disease-causing ATXN8OS/ATXN8 
      expansions is higher than the disease because of the reduced penetrance of the 
      expanded allele. The aim of this study was to describe the first fully penetrant 
      SCA8 family showing mixed Brazilian African and Amerindian origin. Eight members 
      of this family were evaluated-the mother and seven offspring-through a complete 
      neurological examination conducted at the Neurogenetics Clinic, HCFMRP-USP in 
      Brazil. The number of CTA/CTG repeats was obtained after polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) and fragment analysis. The haplotype analysis was conducted using 
      a microsatellite marker, D13S1296, and four single nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs), rs1831189, rs8002227, rs11841483, and rs72284461, all spanning a 70.1 Mb 
      region on chromosome 13q21.3. The molecular analysis showed that the expansions 
      ranged from 104 to 109 CTA/CTG repeats in the six affected individuals and were 
      absent in two asymptomatic daughters (aged 53 and 40 years). Three SNPs 
      cosegregate with the expanded alleles, confirming the connection between 
      expansion and disease in this family. As the SCA8 diagnosis demands careful 
      interpretation, we suggest the use of linkage analysis to observe segregation of 
      the mutation, making more accurate its genotyping.

TI  - Compound heterozygous intermediate MJD alleles cause cerebellar ataxia with 
      sensory neuropathy.
PG  - e123
LID - e123
AB  - Spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) is a group of disorders characterized by 
      progressive ataxia caused by dysfunction and atrophy of the cerebellum or its 
      projections. Approximately one-third of SCD cases are familial SCD, the majority 
      of which are attributed to CAG triplet repeat expansions including 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)1, SCA2, Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, and dentate-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      triplet repeat number of the alleles representing complete penetrance varies 
      among diseases. Generally, there is a gap between the normal alleles and the 
      complete penetrance alleles. Rarely, intermediate alleles with the repeat numbers 
      between the abnormal and normal ranges are observed, although the implications of 
      these intermediate alleles remain ambiguous.

AB  - BACKGROUND: About 50 % of Thai patients with adult-onset spinocerebellar ataxia 
      (SCA) was Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), SCA1, SCA2 and SCA6. The author 
      investigated further on less common SCAs in the patients without any known 
      mutations. METHODS: DNA samples of 82 index patients who were genetically 
      excluded MJD, SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and dentatorubro-pallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) were examined. Analysis of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, SCA17 and SCA19 genes were 
      comprehensively performed. Normal range of trinucleotide repeat expansion sizes 
      of TATA-box-binding protein gene (TBP) were also determined in 374 control 
      subjects. RESULTS: Eight patients carried >/=42 CAG/CAA repeat allele in the TBP 
      consistent with SCA17. The pathological repeat alleles ranged from 42 to 57 
      repeats. All patients had significant degree of cognitive dysfunction. Other 
      non-ataxic phenotypes comprised of parkinsonism, chorea, dystonia and myoclonus. 
      A sporadic patient carried a heterozygous 41-repeat allele developed chronic 
      progressive cerebellar degeneration commenced at the age of 28 years. Whilst, 2 % 
      of the control subjects (8/374) carried the 41-repeat allele. Five of the 
      carriers were re-examined, and revealed that four of them had parkinsonism and/or 
      cognitive impairment without cerebellar signs. Analysis of other types of SCAs 
      was all negative. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA17 and SCA19 in Thais. SCA17 appears to be an important cause of ataxia in 
      Thailand. Although, the pathological cut-off point of the TBP repeat allele 
      remains unclear, the finding suggests that the 41-repeat may be a pathological 
      allele resulting late-onset or mild phenotype. Apart from ataxia, cognitive 
      impairment and parkinsonism may be clinical presentations in these carriers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association of repeat expansion size in 10 common 
      degenerative hereditary ataxia genes with essential tremor. These genes were 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 
      (CACNA1A), SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), 
      SCA-17 (TBP) and dentatorubral-pallidolysian atrophy (DRPLA) (ATN1). METHODS: 
      Genetic analysis of repeat size in 10 degenerative hereditary ataxia loci was 
      performed in 323 essential tremor patients and 299 controls enrolled at Columbia 
      University. To test for differences in the allele distribution between patients 
      and controls, a CLUMP analysis was performed. RESULTS: None of the essential 
      tremor patients had a repeat expansion in the intermediate or pathogenic range. 
      Significant differences in the distribution of repeats in the 'normal' range for 
      SCA2 and SCA8 (both p </= 0.02) were observed between essential tremor patients and 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      SCA loci are not associated with essential tremor.

AB  - Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that are related 
      to at least 36 different genetic loci; they are clinically characterized by 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia and are frequently accompanied by other 
      neurological and non-neurological manifestations. The relative frequency of SCA 
      varies greatly among different regions, presumably because of a founder effect or 
      local ethnicities. Between July 1998 and May 2012, we investigated 320 Brazilian 
      patients with an SCA phenotype who belonged to 150 unrelated families with an 
      autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and 23 sporadic patients from 13 Brazilian 
      states. A total of 265 patients (82.8%) belonging to 131 unrelated families 
      (87.3%) were found to have a definite mutation, and SCA3 accounted for most of 
      the familial cases (70.7%), followed by SCA7 (6%), SCA1 (5.3%), SCA2 (2.7%), SCA6 
      (1.3%), SCA8 (0.7%) and SCA10 (0.7%). In the Ribeirao Preto mesoregion, which is 
      located in the northeast part of Sao Paulo State, the prevalence of SCA3 was 
      approximately 5 per 100,000 inhabitants, which is the highest prevalence found in 
      Brazil. No mutation was found in the SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA genes, and all the 
      sporadic cases remained without a molecular diagnosis. This study further 
      characterizes the spectrum of SCA mutations found in Brazilian patients, which 
      suggests the existence of regional differences and demonstrates the expansion of 
      the SCA8 locus in Brazilian families.

AB  - It has been reported that abnormal processing of pre-mRNA is caused by abnormal 
      triplet expansion. Non-coding triplet expansions produce toxic RNA to alter RNA 
      splicing activities. However, there has been no report on the globular RNA 
      aggregation in neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs) up to now. We herein report 
      on an autopsy case (genetically determined as spinocerebellar atrophy 8 (SCA8)) 
      with hitherto undescribed NCIs throughout the brain. NCIs were chiefly composed 
      of small granular particles, virtually identical to ribosomes. Neurological 
      features are comparable to the widespread lesions of the brain, including the 
      spinal cord. Although 1C2-positivity of NCIs might be induced by reverse 
      transcription of the CTG expansion, it remains to be clarified how abnormal 
      aggregations of ribosome and extensive brain degeneration are related to the 
      reverse or forward transcripts of the expanded repeat.

AB  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs) encompass a heterogeneous group of 
      rare diseases that affect the cerebellum and its connections. The most common 
      forms have been associated with dynamic mutations while some rarer forms with 
      conventional mutations. Studies in different populations revealed differences in 
      their relative frequencies both within and between the studied populations, 
      showing that the frequencies are depended on ethnic and geographical factors. 
      Previous investigation of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, 
      SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in the Cypriot population, revealed no 
      pathogenic expansion in the Cypriot SCA patients. We hereby present our recent 
      investigation of the SCA10 pentanucleotide repeat expansion. Forty-two 
      ascertained Cypriot sporadic ataxia patients, the index case from 1 ADCA and 14 
      ARCA families and a cohort of normal population individuals were included in the 
      study. All our patients have normal range ATXN10 gene ATTCT repeat numbers 
      (10-19). In the normal population group, repeat lengths ranged from 11 to 20 with 
      the 14 repeats allele being the most frequent. Therefore, all currently 
      established dynamic repeat SCA mutations are absent from the Cypriot population, 
      indicating distinct genetic causes.

TI  - Rapid detection of large expansions in progressive myoclonus epilepsy type 1, 
      myotonic dystrophy type 2 and spinocerebellar ataxia type 8.
PG  - 113-20
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Human genetic disorders associated with multiple unstable 
      repeats resulting in long DNA expansions are difficult to identify by 
      conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in routine molecular testing, and 
      therefore require time-consuming hybridisation. To improve and expedite the 
      diagnostic methods for progressive myoclonus epilepsy (EPM1), myotonic dystrophy 
      2 (DM2) and spinocerebellar ataxia 8 (SCA8) caused by dynamic mutations, we 
      adapted a repeat primed PCR (RP-PCR) assay which was previously developed for 
      testing of other triplet repeat disorders. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The new 
      algorithm for molecular analysis was to run a standard PCR to yield alleles in an 
      amplifiable range and then run a RP-PCR to detect larger expansions. 
      Electrophoresis and visualisation of PCR products on an automatic sequencer were 
      applied to determine normal and pathogenic alleles comprising (C4GC4GCG)n in EPM1 
      in 44 subjects, (CCTG)n in DM2 in 76 individuals and (CTG)n in SCA8 in 378 
      patients. RESULTS: The protocol combining conventional PCR and RP-PCR proved to 
      be a rapid and reliable test to diagnose the above named disorders. Among 44 
      individuals tested for EPM1, two expanded alleles were identified in 7 patients. 
      Out of 76 apparently homozygous subjects, RP-PCR allowed us to detect 56 
      expansions specific to DM2, and out of 378 ataxia patients, a large allele of the 
      ATXN8OS gene (SCA8) was found in 25 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Here, for the first 
      time, we report detection of large expansions in EPM1 and SCA8 patients. This 
      RP-PCR assay is high throughput, reproducible and sensitive enough to be 
      successfully used for diagnostic purposes.

TI  - Analysis of spinocerebellar ataxias due to expanded triplet repeats in Greek 
      patients with cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 178-80
LID - 10.1016/j.jns.2012.03.019 [doi]
AB  - The relative frequency of different autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias, 
      commonly referred to as spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), varies considerably among 
      populations of different ethnic origin. No data exist at present on the frequency 
      of different SCAs in the Greek population. In the present study we investigated 
      the presence of triplet repeat expansion SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, SCA12, SCA17 and DRPLA) in a cohort of 83 Greek patients with slowly 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia. Twenty patients came from autosomal dominant (AD) 
      pedigrees, seven displayed recessive or unclear inheritance and 56 were sporadic. 
      We found four patients with pathological SCA expansions, all from AD pedigrees. 
      Two patients had SCA1, one SCA2 and one SCA7 (10.0, 5.0 and 5.0% of the AD group, 
      respectively). The clinical features of these patients were within the expected 
      spectrum. In total, a pathological expansion was detected in 20% of patients from 
      AD pedigrees. Interestingly, no cases of SCA3 or SCA6 were detected in the AD 
      group. No expansions were found in other familial cases or in sporadic patients. 
      Overall, no cases of SCA3, SCA6, SCA12, SCA17 or DRPLA were identified in the 
      Greek population. In conclusion, SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 are present in Greek 
      patients with AD cerebellar ataxia in frequencies similar to those observed in 
      other populations. SCA3 and SCA6 appear however to be rare in Greece. The genetic 
      cause for the majority of AD ataxias remains to be identified.

TI  - Genetic screening of Greek patients with Huntington's disease phenocopies 
      identifies an SCA8 expansion.
PG  - 1874-8
AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a 
      triad of chorea, psychiatric disturbance and cognitive decline. Around 1% of 
      patients with HD-like symptoms lack the causative HD expansion and are considered 
      HD phenocopies. Genetic diseases that can present as HD phenocopies include 
      HD-like syndromes such as HDL1, HDL2 and HDL4 (SCA17), some spinocerebellar 
      ataxias (SCAs) and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). In this study we 
      screened a cohort of 21 Greek patients with HD phenocopy syndromes formutations 
      causing HDL2, SCA17, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3,SCA8, SCA12 and DRPLA. Fifteen patients 
      (71%) had a positive family history. We identified one patient (4.8% of the total 
      cohort) with an expansion of 81 combined CTA/CTG repeats at the SCA8 locus. This 
      falls within what is believed to be the high-penetrance allele range. In addition 
      to the classic HD triad, the patient had features of dystonia and oculomotor 
      apraxia. There were no cases of HDL2, SCA17, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA12 or DRPLA. 
      Given the controversy surrounding the SCA8 expansion, the present finding may be 
      incidental. However, if pathogenic, it broadens the phenotype that may be 
      associated with SCA8 expansions. The absence of any other mutations in our cohort 
      is not surprising, given the low probability of reaching a genetic diagnosis in 
      HD phenocopy patients.

TI  - Detection of large expansions in SCA8 using a fluorescent repeat-primed PCR 
      assay.
PG  - 63-6
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia. It is caused by 
      bidirectional expression of (CUG)n expansion in the ATXN80S/ATXN8 gene and (CAG)n 
      expansion transcripts in ATXN8. The diagnosis of SCA8 must be confirmed by the 
      presence of a (CTG)n trinucleotide repeat expansion in the ATXN8OS gene. On the 
      other hand, there are many human genetic diseases that are caused by expansion of 
      short tandem repeats. Since Werner et al proposed a repeat-primed fluorescent PCR 
      to detect large CTG-repeats in myotonic dystrophy, Friedreich ataxia, SCA2, SCA7, 
      SCA10 and SCA12 have been reported. In this study, we applied a fluorescent PCR 
      method for detection of expanded repeats in the ATXN8OS/ATXN8 gene. Although this 
      test cannot give a precise estimate of the size of the expansion, it proved 
      useful for confirming the presence of expansions in SCA8.

LID - 10.1073/pnas.1013343108 [doi]
AB  - Trinucleotide expansions cause disease by both protein- and RNA-mediated 
      mechanisms. Unexpectedly, we discovered that CAG expansion constructs express 
      homopolymeric polyglutamine, polyalanine, and polyserine proteins in the absence 
      of an ATG start codon. This repeat-associated non-ATG translation (RAN 
      translation) occurs across long, hairpin-forming repeats in transfected cells or 
      when expansion constructs are integrated into the genome in lentiviral-transduced 
      cells and brains. Additionally, we show that RAN translation across human 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) CAG 
      expansion transcripts results in the accumulation of SCA8 polyalanine and DM1 
      polyglutamine expansion proteins in previously established SCA8 and DM1 mouse 
      models and human tissue. These results have implications for understanding 
      fundamental mechanisms of gene expression. Moreover, these toxic, unexpected, 
      homopolymeric proteins now should be considered in pathogenic models of 
      microsatellite disorders.

AB  - We report the case of a 29 year old woman with a complex movement disorder 
      syndrome due to the combination of coexisting pathological triplet repeat 
      expansions of huntingtin and ATXN8 genes. The disease course was characterized by 
      mental disturbances including cognitive decline and changes in personality 
      starting at the age of 12 years, followed by twisting motions, intentional tremor 
      and gait ataxia. Later Parkinsonian symptoms of micrographia, bradykinesia, 
      muscle rigidity and mental decline became dominant. Brain MRI showed hypoplasia 
      of the nucleus caudatus and generalized atrophy; MR spectroscopy revealed a 
      decrease of all typical metabolites except for an increased level of lactate and 
      acetate. Therapeutic trials with pramipexole, ropinirole and tetrabenazine showed 
      no benefit, while levetiracetam caused agitation and hallucinations. We discuss 
      phenotype-genotype correlation and the rule of triplet repeat expansions of gene 
      ATXN8.

      population-based study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An increasing number of dominant and recessive disorders have been 
      associated with late onset chronic progressive ataxia (LOCA) complicating the 
      formulation of a rational diagnostic strategy. Furthermore, there is marked 
      geographic and ethnic variation in the relative importance of these individual 
      disorders and the cause of such observed variation remains unexplained. METHODS: 
      We have systematically investigated a population-based cohort of patients with 
      chronic progressive LOCA for SCA 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17, FXTAS and FRDA. In 
      addition we have examined repeat length polymorphism in chromosomes from a 
      genetically homogeneous and representative control population to investigate the 
      association of high-normal repeats and disease prevalence. RESULTS: A total of 
      178 patients including 55 familial cases segregating in 38 kindreds and 123 
      sporadic were investigated. Pathological expansions were identified in 11/38 
      (28.9 %) of families and in 5/123 (4.1 %) of sporadic patients. The most frequent 
      diagnoses were SCA6 (6 families and 1 sporadic patient), DRPLA (4 families) and 
      SCA8 (1 family). In addition, one elderly female patient was identified with 
      "possible FXTAS". Six (2 %) control patients were noted to have expanded SCA8 
      alleles. CONCLUSIONS: SCA6 and DRPLA were the most frequent genetic diagnoses 
      identified. Patterns of high-normal allele frequency in this UK population were 
      distinct compared to other ethnic groups but this was poorly predictive of the 
      distribution of disease in this region. The relative contribution of new mutation 
      formation and founder effects to the prevalence of familial ataxia is uncertain, 
      and further exploration of these factors will require detailed analysis of 
      disease allele haplotypes and meiotic instability of intermediate length alleles.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) involves bidirectional expression of CUG 
      (ATXN8OS) and CAG (ATXN8) expansion transcripts. The pathogenesis of SCA8 is 
      complex and the spectrum of clinical presentations is broad. In the present 
      study, we assessed the SCA8 repeat size ranges in Taiwanese Parkinson's disease, 
      Alzheimer's disease and atypical parkinsonism and investigated the genetic 
      variation modulating ATXN8 expression. Thirteen large SCA8 alleles and a novel 
      ATXN8 -62 G/A promoter SNP were found. There is a significant difference in the 
      proportion of the individuals carrying SCA8 larger alleles in atypical 
      parkinsonism (P = 0.044) as compared to that in the control subjects. In 
      lymphoblastoid cells carrying SCA8 large alleles, treatment of MG-132 or 
      staurosporine significantly increases the cell death or caspase 3 activity. 
      Although expressed at low steady-state, ATXN8 expression level is significantly 
      higher (P = 0.012) in cells with SCA8 large alleles than that of the control 
      cells. The ATXN8 transcriptional activity was significantly higher in the 
      luciferase reporter construct containing the -62G allele than that containing the 
      -62A allele in both neuroblastoma and embryonic kidney cells. Therefore, our 
      preliminary results suggest that ATXN8 gene -62 G/A polymorphism may be 
      functional in modulating ATXN8 expression.

AB  - We report a family with 16q-ADCA(16q 22.1 linked autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia) coexisting with SCA8 repeat expansion. The brothers in this family 
      presented with pyramidal signs, tremor, myoclonus and mental retardation in 
      addition to cerebellar symptom in childhood. They showed both C-to-T substitution 
      puratrophin-1 gene and an expanded allele of the SCA8 gene in the brothers and 
      their father. These siblings presented with atypical symptoms and early onset age 
      as16q-ADCA. Although it remains controversial whether the expanded SCA8 allele is 
      associated with cerebellar symptoms, the coexistence of SCA8 repeat expansion 
      with SCA6 was reported previously. Pure or predominant cerebellar symptoms were 
      found in patients with SCA8, SCA6 and 16q-ADCA. In addition, common findings in 
      neuropathology of SCA8, SCA6 and 16q-ADCA have been reported. We suppose that 
      coexistence of SCA8 repeat expansion with 16q-ADCA may be involved in the 
      pathogenesis and severe symptoms in this family.

LID - 10.1007/s12311-008-0010-7 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a dominantly inherited, slowly 
      progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CTG.CAG repeat expansion 
      located on chromosome 13q21. The expansion mutation was isolated directly from 
      the DNA of a single patient using RAPID cloning and subsequently shown to 
      co-segregate with disease in additional ataxia families including a 
      seven-generation kindred (the MN-A family). The size-dependent penetrance of the 
      repeat found in the large MN-A kindred makes it appear as though some parts of 
      the family have a dominant disorder while other parts of this same family have 
      recessive or sporadic forms of ataxia. While the linkage and size-dependent 
      penetrance of the SCA8 CTG.CAG expansion in the MN-A family argue that the SCA8 
      expansion causes ataxia, the reduced penetrance in other SCA8 families and the 
      discovery of expansions in the general population have led to a controversy 
      surrounding whether or not the SCA8 expansion is pathogenic. A recently reported 
      mouse model in which SCA8 BAC-expansion but not BAC-control lines develop a 
      progressive neurological phenotype now demonstrates the pathogenicity of the 
      (CTG.CAG)(n) expansion. These mice show a loss of cerebellar GABAergic inhibition 
      and, similar to human patients, have 1C2-positive intranuclear inclusions in 
      Purkinje cells and other neurons. Additional studies demonstrate that the SCA8 
      expansion is expressed in both directions (CUG and CAG) and that a novel gene 
      expressed in the CAG direction encodes a pure polyglutamine expansion protein 
      (ataxin 8, ATXN8). Moreover, the expression of non-coding (CUG)(n) expansion 
      transcripts (ataxin 8 opposite strand, ATXN8OS) and the discovery of intranuclear 
      polyglutamine inclusions suggest SCA8 pathogenesis may involve toxic 
      gain-of-function mechanisms at both the protein and RNA levels. Our data, 
      combined with the recently reported antisense transcripts spanning the DM1 repeat 
      expansion in the CAG direction and the growing number of reports of antisense 
      transcripts expressed throughout the mammalian genome, raises the possibility 
      that bidirectional expression across pathogenic microsatellite expansions may 
      occur in other expansion disorders, and that potential pathogenic effects of 
      mutations expressed from both strands should be considered.

TI  - Case control analysis of repeat expansion size in ataxia.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous neurological diseases. The expansion of unstable microsatellite 
      repeats has been identified as the underlying pathogenic cause of 10 subtypes of 
      autosomal dominant SCAs. The aetiology of sporadic SCA is unknown. The aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effect of large normal repeats in patients 
      presenting with sporadic or familial ataxia compared to a control population. The 
      size of the expansion was determined using a fluorescent PCR approach in 10 
      common SCA genes: SCA-1 (ATXN1), SCA-2 (ATXN2), SCA-3 (ATXN3), SCA-6 (CACNA1A), 
      SCA-7 (ATXN7), SCA-8 (ATXN8OS), SCA-10 (ATXN10), SCA-12 (PPP2R2B), SCA-17 (TBP) 
      and DRPLA (ATN1), in 165 ataxia patients and 307 controls of Welsh origin. There 
      was no difference between cases and controls in the distribution of the large 
      normal alleles, or in the distribution of the combined CAG repeats. The normal 
      allele distribution in the Welsh population was largely similar to that of other 
      Caucasian populations. Our study failed to demonstrate an effect of large normal 
      repeats on the susceptibility to develop ataxia.

TI  - Targeted deletion of a single Sca8 ataxia locus allele in mice causes abnormal 
      gait, progressive loss of motor coordination, and Purkinje cell dendritic 
      deficits.
PG  - 9975-82
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) patients typically have a slowly 
      progressive, adult-onset ataxia. SCA8 is dominantly inherited and is caused by 
      large CTG repeat expansions in the untranslated antisense RNA of the Kelch-like 1 
      gene (KLHL1), but the molecular mechanism through which this expansion leads to 
      disease is still unknown. To more fully characterize the underlying molecular 
      mechanisms involved in SCA8, we developed a mouse model in which Klhl1 is deleted 
      in either all tissues or is deleted specifically in Purkinje cells only. We found 
      that mice that are either homozygous or heterozygous for the Klhl1 deletion have 
      significant gait abnormalities at an early age and develop a significant loss of 
      motor coordination by 24 weeks of age. This loss progresses more rapidly in 
      homozygous knock-outs. Mice with Klhl1 specifically deleted in only Purkinje 
      cells had a loss of motor coordination that was almost identical to the 
      total-tissue deletion mice. Finally, we found significant Purkinje cell dendritic 
      deficits, as measured by the thickness of the molecular layer, in all mice in 
      which Klhl1 was deleted (both total and Purkinje cell-specific deletions) and an 
      intermediate reduction in molecular layer thickness in mice with reduced levels 
      of Klhl1 expression (heterozygous deletions). The results from this mouse model 
      show that even a partial loss of Klhl1 function leads to degeneration of Purkinje 
      cell function and indicates that loss of KLHL1 activity is likely to play a 
      significant part in the underlying pathophysiology of SCA8.

TI  - Haplotype diversity and somatic instability in normal and expanded SCA8 alleles.
PG  - 109-14
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is an autosomal dominant late-onset 
      neurodegenerative disorder, belonging to the group of diseases caused by 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions. SCA8 remains one of the most intriguing SCAs, 
      regarding the reduced disease penetrance, and the high instability and poorly 
      understood functional meaning of the (CTA)(n)(CTG)(n) expansion. We performed 
      haplotype and sequencing analysis in a large region, encompassing the repeat, in 
      four SCA8 and 20 control Portuguese families. The results from the haplotype 
      study including the combined repeat and six SNP markers showed two different 
      haplotypes, AG-Exp-GTTG and AG-Exp-CTTG, in the SCA8 families. Among the control 
      population, these were also the most frequent, in a total of five haplotypes 
      found unequally distributed throughout repeat sizes. From cloning fragments of 
      control, unstable normal and expanded chromosomes, eleven different base 
      substitutions were identified in exon A of the SCA8 gene. In some instances, 
      somatic variability in repeat size or base composition was found for a same 
      chromosome, regardless of its normal or expanded nature. In conclusion, our 
      results in Portuguese families with ataxia show that SCA8 expansions arose in 
      common backgrounds; in addition, this region seems to be unstable beyond the 
      repeat.

TI  - Expanded trinucleotide repeats in the TBP/SCA17 gene mapped to chromosome 6q27 
      are associated with schizophrenia.
PG  - 131-6
AB  - Schizophrenia has a complex and non-Mendelian mode of inheritance. Recently, 
      trinucleotide repeat (TNR)-containing genes have been considered as the candidate 
      genes predisposing to schizophrenia. The purpose of this study was to determine 
      whether a genetic association could be observed between schizophrenia and the TNR 
      polymorphisms within the KLHL1AS/SCA8, PPP2R2B/SCA12, and TBP/SCA17 genes. We 
      studied 100 unrelated schizophrenia patients and 124 controls without evident 
      neurodegenerative or psychiatric disorders. The overall allele frequency 
      distributions of the KLHL1AS/SCA8 and PPP2R2B/SCA12 genes were not significantly 
      different between the schizophrenic patients and the control subjects (P>0.05). 
      The allele frequency distribution in the schizophrenic patients was significantly 
      different from that in the controls at the TBP/SCA17 gene (P=0.0149), with an 
      increased frequency of 36 repeats in the patients and two patients carrying 45 
      TNR expansions were identified. TBP/SCA17 is the TATA box binding protein gene 
      mapped to chromosome 6q27. The study suggests that TNR expansions of the 
      TBP/SCA17 gene may contribute to the genetic risk of schizophrenia in rare cases.

TI  - Comparative genetics of functional trinucleotide tandem repeats in humans and 
      apes.
PG  - 329-39
AB  - Several human neurodegenerative disorders are caused by the expansion of 
      polymorphic trinucleotide repeat regions. Many of these loci are functional short 
      tandem repeats (STRs) located in brain-expressed genes, and their study is thus 
      relevant from both a medical and an evolutionary point of view. The aims of our 
      study are to infer the comparative pattern of variation and evolution of this set 
      of loci in order to show species-specific features in this group of STRs and on 
      their potential for expansion (therefore, an insight into evolutionary medicine) 
      and to unravel whether any human-specific feature may be identified in 
      brain-expressed genes involved in human disease. We analyzed the variability of 
      the normal range of seven expanding STR CAG/CTG loci (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3-MJD, SCA6, 
      SCA8, SCA12, and DRPLA) and two nonexpanding polymorphic CAG loci (KCNN3 and 
      NCOA3) in humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. The study showed a 
      general conservation of the repetitive tract and of the polymorphism in the four 
      species and high heterogeneity among loci distributions. Humans present slightly 
      larger alleles than the rest of species but a more relevant difference appears in 
      variability levels: Humans are the species with the largest variance, although 
      only for the expanding loci, suggesting a relationship between variability levels 
      and expansion potential. The sequence analysis shows high levels of sequence 
      conservation among species, a lack of correspondence between interruption 
      patterns and variability levels, and signs of conservative selective pressure for 
      some of the STR loci. Only two loci (SCA1 and SCA8) show a human specific 
      distribution, with larger alleles than the rest of species. This could account, 
      at the same time, for a human-specific trait and a predisposition to disease 
      through expansion.

TI  - Molecular genetics of hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia: mutation analysis of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia genes and CAG/CTG repeat expansion detection in 225 
      Italian families.
PG  - 727-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias are a clinical and genetically 
      heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, at present 
      associated with 22 loci (spinocerebellar ataxia [SCA] 1-SCA8, SCA10-SCA19, SCA21, 
      SCA22, fibroblast growth factor 14 [FGF14]-SCA, and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy [DRPLA]). The relevant gene has been identified in 12 cases (SCA1-3, 
      SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, FGF14, and DRPLA), and in all but the recently identified 
      SCA14, SCA17, PRKCG and FGF14 genes, the defect consists of the expansion of a 
      short nucleotide repeat. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relative prevalence of 
      SCA1-3, SCA6-8, SCA10, SCA12, and SCA17 gene expansions in Italian families with 
      hereditary ataxia, specifically to verify the occurrence of SCA10, SCA12, and 
      SCA17 in Italy; and to analyze samples from probands with negative test results 
      at the initial screening by means of the repeat expansion detection technique to 
      identify CAG/CTG expansions in novel loci.Patients Two hundred twenty-five 
      unrelated Italian index cases with hereditary ataxia, most (n = 183) of whom 
      presented with a clear dominantly transmitted trait. RESULTS: We found that SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene mutations accounted for most cases (21% and 24%, respectively). We 
      found SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, and SCA17 to be very rare (approximately 1% each), 
      and no case of SCA10 or SCA12 was identified. Half of the index cases (113/225) 
      were negative for expansions in the known SCA genes. Repeat expansion detection 
      analysis performed on 111 of these cases showed a CAG/CTG repeat expansion of at 
      least 50 triplets in 22 (20%). Twenty-one of 22 expansions could be attributed to 
      length variation at 2 polymorphic loci (expanded repeat domain CAG/CTG 1 [ERDA1] 
      or CTG repeat on chromosome 18q21.1 [CTG18.1]). In 1 patient, the expansion was 
      assigned to the DRPLA gene. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of SCA1-3 and SCA6-7 
      gene mutations is peculiar in Italy. We found a relatively high frequency of SCA1 
      and SCA2 gene expansions; SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 mutations were rare, compared with 
      other European countries. No SCA10 or SCA12 and only a few SCA8 (2/225) and SCA17 
      (2/225) families were detected. In patients negative for defects in known SCA 
      genes, repeat expansion detection data strongly suggest that, at least in our 
      population, CAG/CTG expansions in novel genes should be considered an unlikely 
      cause of the SCA phenotype.

TI  - Analysis of trinucleotide repeats in different SCA loci in spinocerebellar ataxia 
      patients and in normal population of Taiwan.
PG  - 355-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify various subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) among 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) patients referred to our research 
      center, SCA1, SCA2, SCA3/MJD (Machado-Joseph disease), SCA6, SCA7, SCA8 and SCA12 
      loci were assessed for expansion of trinucleotide repeats. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      A total of 211 ADCA patients, including 202 patients with dominantly inherited 
      ataxia from 81 Taiwanese families and nine patients with sporadic ataxia, were 
      included in this study and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. 
      The amplified products of all loci were analyzed on both 3% agarose gels and 6% 
      denaturing urea-polyacrylamide gels. PCR-based Southern blots were also applied 
      for the detection of SCA7 locus. RESULTS: The SCA1 mutation was detected in six 
      affected individuals from one family (1.2%) with expanded alleles of 50-53 CAG 
      repeats. Fourteen individuals from nine families (11%) had a CAG trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion at the SCA2 locus, while affected SCA2 alleles have 34-49 CAG 
      repeats. The SCA3/MJD CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in 60 affected 
      individuals from 26 families (32%) was expanded to 71-85 CAG repeats. As for the 
      SCA7 locus, there were two affected individuals from one family (1.2%) possessed 
      41 and 100 CAG repeats, respectively. However, we did not detect expansion in the 
      SCA6, SCA8 and SCA12 loci in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The SCA3/MJD CAG expansion 
      was the most frequent mutation among the SCA patients. The relative prevalence of 
      SCA3/MJD in Taiwan was higher than that of SCA2, SCA1 and SCA7.

TI  - The spinocerebellar ataxia 8 noncoding RNA causes neurodegeneration and 
      associates with staufen in Drosophila.
PG  - 302-8
AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia 8 (SCA8) appears unique among triplet repeat 
      expansion-induced neurodegenerative diseases because the predicted gene product 
      is a noncoding RNA. Little is currently known about the normal function of SCA8 
      in neuronal survival or how repeat expansion contributes to neurodegeneration. To 
      investigate the molecular context in which SCA8 operates, we have expressed the 
      human SCA8 noncoding RNA in Drosophila. SCA8 induces late-onset, progressive 
      neurodegeneration in the Drosophila retina. Using this neurodegenerative 
      phenotype as a sensitized background for a genetic modifier screen, we have 
      identified mutations in four genes: staufen, muscle-blind, split ends, and 
      CG3249. All four encode neuronally expressed RNA binding proteins conserved in 
      Drosophila and humans. Although expression of both wild-type and repeat-expanded 
      SCA8 induce neurodegeneration, the strength of interaction with certain modifiers 
      differs between the two SCA8 backgrounds, suggesting that CUG expansions alter 
      associations with specific RNA binding proteins. Our demonstration that SCA8 can 
      recruit Staufen and that the interaction domain maps to the portion of the SCA8 
      RNA that undergoes repeat expansion in the human disease suggests a specific 
      mechanism for SCA8 function and disease. Genetic modifiers identified in our 
      SCA8-based screens may provide candidates for designing therapeutic interventions 
      to treat this disease.

TI  - Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia: SCA2 is the most frequent mutation in 
      eastern India.
PG  - 448-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) has been reported as the 
      commonest dominant hereditary ataxia in India. However, India is an ethnically 
      and religiously diverse population. Previous studies have not clearly indicated 
      exact ethnic and religious origins, and must therefore be interpreted with 
      caution. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of different 
      SCA mutations in a relatively homogeneous population from eastern India. METHODS: 
      We identified 28 families with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia from eastern 
      India. Each underwent full clinical evaluation and were analysed for the presence 
      of SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, and SCA17 mutations. In addition, 
      haplotype analysis was carried out in seven of the 16 families with SCA2. 
      RESULTS: Seven patients from four (14%) families were positive for an expansion 
      in SCA1 and 26 patients from 16 (57%) families were positive for an expansion in 
      SCA2. No mutations were detected in the remaining eight families (29%). Most of 
      the SCA1 and SCA2 families were Hindu from the state of Bihar. Five out of 26 
      SCA2 patients in this study did not have slow saccades. In addition, four of 
      seven SCA1 patients had slow saccades. We found an association between the SCA2 
      CAG repeat expansion and the 285 base pair (bp) allele of microsatellite marker 
      D12S1672, and also data supportive of the association between the expansion and 
      the 225 bp allele of D12S1333, which has been previously described. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We conclude that (1) although slow ocular saccades are highly suggestive of SCA2, 
      that they are not universal, nor are they exclusive to this disorder and (2) SCA2 
      is likely to be the commonest dominant ataxia in eastern India, with further 
      evidence for a founder effect.

TI  - Polymorphism of trinucleotide repeats in non-translated regions of SCA8 and SCA12 
      genes: allele distribution in a Polish control group.
PG  - 101-5
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias are a group of neurodegenerative disorders caused by 
      dynamic mutations of microsatellite repeats. Two novel forms of SCAs have been 
      described recently: SCA8, with expansions of CTA/CTG repeats in 3'UTR of the SCA8 
      gene, and SCA12, caused by expansion of the CAG tract in 5'UTR of the 
      SCA12/PP2R2B gene. Analysis of CTA/CTG and CAG polymorphism in those two genes 
      was performed in a Polish control group consisting of 100 individuals without any 
      neurological signs. The distribution and ranges of the number of non-pathogenic 
      repeats were similar to those observed in other populations described previously. 
      Expansion of CTA/CTG repeats in the SCA8 locus was found in 2 of 100 controls and 
      in 5 probands among 150 pedigrees affected with unidentified ataxias. As such 
      expanded alleles were also observed in their healthy relatives, the pathogenic 
      role of expansions in the SCA8 gene remains uncertain.

TI  - Genetic testing in spinocerebellar ataxia in Taiwan: expansions of trinucleotide 
      repeats in SCA8 and SCA17 are associated with typical Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 209-14
AB  - DNA tests in normal subjects and patients with ataxia and Parkinson's disease 
      (PD) were carried out to assess the frequency of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) and 
      to document the distribution of SCA mutations underlying ethnic Chinese in 
      Taiwan. MJD/SCA3 (46%) was the most common autosomal dominant SCA in the 
      Taiwanese cohort, followed by SCA6 (18%) and SCA1 (3%). No expansions of SCA 
      types 2, 10, 12, or dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) were detected. The 
      clinical phenotypes of these affected SCA patients were very heterogeneous. All 
      of them showed clinical symptoms of cerebellar ataxia, with or without other 
      associated features. The frequencies of large normal alleles are closely 
      associated with the prevalence of SCA1, SCA2, MJD/SCA3, SCA6, and DRPLA among 
      Taiwanese, Japanese, and Caucasians. Interestingly, abnormal expansions of SCA8 
      and SCA17 genes were detected in patients with PD. The clinical presentation for 
      these patients is typical of idiopathic PD with the following characteristics: 
      late onset of disease, resting tremor in the limbs, rigidity, bradykinesia, and a 
      good response to levodopa. This study appears to be the first report describing 
      the PD phenotype in association with an expanded allele in the TATA-binding 
      protein gene and suggests that SCA8 may also be a cause of typical PD.

TI  - Do CTG expansions at the SCA8 locus cause ataxia?
PG  - 110-5
AB  - To evaluate the significance of expanded CTG repeats at the SCA8 locus, we 
      analyzed the allele distribution in 1,262 German ataxia patients. We found 
      intermediate and expanded CTG repeats with similar frequencies in ataxia patients 
      with and without established genetic diseases. One family linked to the SCA8 
      locus showed incomplete penetrance and an association of smaller CTG repeats with 
      more severe disease. Our data question the disease-causing character of CTG 
      expansions for SCA8 and advise great caution in genetic testing.

TI  - A novel autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA22) linked to chromosome 
      1p21-q23.
PG  - 1293-9
AB  - The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically, pathologically 
      and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. Ten responsible genes have been 
      identified for spinocerebellar ataxia types SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, 
      SCA10, SCA12 and SCA17, and dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA). The 
      mutation is caused by an expansion of a CAG, CTG or ATTCT repeat sequence of 
      these genes. Six additional loci, SCA4, SCA5, SCA11, SCA13, SCA14 and SCA16 have 
      also been mapped. The growing heterogeneity of the autosomal dominant forms of 
      these diseases shows that the genetic aetiologies of at least 20% of ADCA have 
      yet to be elucidated. We ascertained and clinically characterized a 
      four-generation Chinese pedigree segregating an autosomal dominant phenotype for 
      cerebellar ataxia. Direct mutation analysis, linkage analysis for all known SCA 
      loci and a genome-wide linkage study were performed. Direct mutation analysis 
      excluded SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17 and DRPLA, and genetic linkage analysis 
      excluded SCA4, 5, 11, 13, 14 and 16. The genome-wide linkage study suggested 
      linkage to a locus on chromosome 1p21-q23, with the highest two-point LOD score 
      at D1S1167 (Zmax = 3.46 at theta = 0.00). Multipoint analysis and haplotype 
      reconstruction traced this novel SCA locus (SCA22) to a 43.7-cM interval flanked 
      by D1S206 and D1S2878 (Zmax = 3.78 under four liability classes, and 2.67 using 
      affected-only method). The age at onset ranged from 10 to 46 years. All affected 
      members had gait ataxia with variable features of dysarthria and hyporeflexia. 
      Head MRI showed homogeneous atrophy of the cerebellum without involvement of the 
      brainstem. In six parent-child pairs, median onset occurred 10 years earlier in 
      offspring than in their parents, suggesting anticipation. This family is distinct 
      from other families with SCA and is characterized by a slowly progressive, pure 
      cerebellar ataxia.

TI  - SCA8 repeat expansion: large CTA/CTG repeat alleles are more common in ataxic 
      patients, including those with SCA6.
PG  - 704-9
AB  - We analyzed the SCA8 CTA/CTG repeat in a large group of Japanese subjects. The 
      frequency of large alleles (85-399 CTA/CTG repeats) was 1.9% in spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA), 0.4% in Parkinson disease, 0.3% in Alzheimer disease, and 0% in a 
      healthy control group; the frequency was significantly higher in the group with 
      SCA than in the control group. Homozygotes for large alleles were observed only 
      in the group with SCA. In five patients with SCA from two families, a large SCA8 
      CTA/CTG repeat and a large SCA6 CAG repeat coexisted. Age at onset was correlated 
      with SCA8 repeats rather than SCA6 repeats in these five patients. In one of 
      these families, at least one patient showed only a large SCA8 CTA/CTG repeat 
      allele, with no large SCA6 CAG repeat allele. We speculate that the presence of a 
      large SCA8 CTA/CTG repeat allele influences the function of channels such as 
      alpha(1A)-voltage-dependent calcium channel through changing or aberrant 
      splicing, resulting in the development of cerebellar ataxia, especially in 
      homozygous patients.

TI  - Understanding the dynamics of Spinocerebellar Ataxia 8 (SCA8) locus through a 
      comparative genetic approach in humans and apes.
PG  - 143-6
AB  - Spinocerebellar Ataxia 8 (SCA8) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      expansion of a trinucleotide repeat. We undertake a comparative genetic analysis 
      among human populations and primate species in the normal variation range, where 
      forces that shaped present diversity can be recognised. We determinate number of 
      repeats of the short tandem repeat through allele length sizing and sequencing 
      methods. Human allele distributions are very similar among populations, ruling 
      out ethnicity as a genetic risk for allele expansion. Primate comparison shows 
      human-specific features, with longer human alleles due to a novel variable 
      trinucleotide repeat, not present in non-human primates, which increased the 
      disease-causing expansion likelihood. SCA8 seems to be a human specific disease.

TI  - A family with spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 expansion and vitamin E deficiency 
      ataxia.
PG  - 1952-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency is a recessive autosomal 
      neurodegenerative disorder resembling the Friedreich ataxia phenotype but is due 
      to mutations in the alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (TTPA) gene. In a recent 
      article, we described a patient with ataxia carrying reduced serum vitamin E 
      levels and showing CTA/CTG expansions of 320 triplet repeats in the SCA8 gene. 
      OBJECTIVES: To perform a screening of the TTPA gene in the patient and to 
      evaluate the effects of treatment with vitamin E on the patient's neurologic 
      disturbances. PATIENT AND METHODS: We performed a single-strand conformation 
      polymorphism and nucleotide sequence analysis of the 5 exons of the TTPA gene in 
      the patient's family members. RESULTS: The results indicated the patient to be a 
      compound heterozygote for 2 mutations (in exon 3), each transmitted by one of the 
      2 parents, yielding a nonfunctional protein. CONCLUSIONS: We describe for the 
      first time, to our knowledge, a mutated form of the TTPA gene in a patient also 
      carrying an expansion in the SCA8 gene. The lack of improvement in the patient's 
      symptoms on supplementation with alpha-tocopherol suggests that the SCA8 
      mutations may act in the neurodegeneration process, worsening the neurologic 
      signs caused by the vitamin E deficit, and it could be speculated that the 
      co-occurrence of mutant alleles for 2 distinct loci may influence the clinical 
      course of the disease.

TI  - SCA8 in the Spanish population including one homozygous patient.
PG  - 404-9
AB  - Controversial data have been reported about SCA8 since its description in 1999. 
      The most accepted hypothesis is that CTG expansions within the CTA/CTG combined 
      repeat expansion in the SCA8 locus causes SCA8. It is inherited as a dominant 
      trait with reduced penetrance. The present study, reports the first data 
      regarding SCA8 in the Spanish population and the clinical findings in patients 
      carrying expanded alleles, including one homozygous patient. Two hundred and 
      forty-six individuals from the Spanish population, including controls (149) and 
      ataxic patients (97), were studied. DNA was extracted from blood samples using 
      standard methods. Amplification of the CTA/CTG 3'untranslated region was achieved 
      by PCR using primers SCA8-F3 and SCA8-R4 and conditions described previously. 
      Neurological reevaluation was done in individuals carrying the expanded allele. 
      We detected five unrelated expanded alleles corresponding to three affected 
      patients (one of them homozygous) and one healthy individual. SCA8 represents 4% 
      of the total dominant spinocerebellar ataxias studied in our group (Spanish 
      population) (three index patients out of 75 dominant ataxic independent nucleus). 
      The patient that resulted homozygous for the expansion is a 25-year-old man with 
      a clinical picture of progressive ataxia and dysarthria that began at the age of 
      12. On neurological examination, he showed ataxia, slight dysarthria and 
      nystagmus to the extreme lateral gaze. A cranial MRI showed global atrophy of 
      cerebellum but the brainstem was spared. Family history showed the presence of 
      ataxia in his grandfather and father. His mother is healthy at the age of 52 and 
      a molecular study of SCA8 reveals one allele that could be considered as 
      premutated. She has no ataxia antecedents in her family. Our results provide 
      additional information about the SCA8 expansion, within the Spanish population. 
      These results are in agreement with the hypothesis of the CTG expansion in the 
      SCA8 locus being responsible for the SCA8 ataxia showing reduced penetrance. 
      Besides homozygous status, advancing age at onset (as previously described for 
      other SCAs) supports this idea.

TI  - Genetic and clinical analysis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 repeat expansion 
      in Yugoslavia.
PG  - 321-4
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a slowly progressive ataxia causally 
      associated with untranslated CTG repeat expansion on chromosome 13q21. However, 
      the role of the CTG repeat in SCA8 pathology is not yet well understood. 
      Therefore, we studied the length of the SCA8 CTA/CTG expansions (combined 
      repeats, CRs) in 115 patients with ataxia, 64 unrelated individuals with 
      non-triplet neuromuscular diseases, 70 unrelated patients with schizophrenia, and 
      125 healthy controls. Only one patient with apparently sporadic ataxia was 
      identified with an expansion of 100 CRs. He had inherited the expansion from his 
      asymptomatic father (140 CRs) and transmitted the mutation to his son (92 CRs). 
      Paternal transmission in this family produced contractions of 40 and 8 CRs, 
      respectively. None of the subjects from other studied groups had an expansion at 
      the SCA8 locus. In the control group the number of CRs at the SCA8 locus ranged 
      from 14 to 34. Our findings support the notion that allelic variants of the 
      expansion mutation at the SCA8 locus can predispose to ataxia.

TI  - Analysis of SCA8 and SCA12 loci in 134 Italian ataxic patients negative for 
      SCA1-3, 6 and 7 CAG expansions.
PG  - 923-9
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      disorders, six of which are caused by expansion of a polyglutamine-coding CAG 
      repeats ( SCA1- 3, 6, 7 and 17). In addition, expansions of a CAG triplet in the 
      5' region of a gene and a CTG triplet in an antisense RNA have been demonstrated 
      in the SCA12 and SCA8 genes respectively. Our series of 134 ataxic patients (22 
      familial and 112 sporadic, tested negative for SCAI-3, 6, 7) was investigated for 
      the presence of triplet expansions in the SCA8 and SCA12 genes. No SCA12 
      expansion was identified. A moderate SCA8 expansion (85-97 repeats) was found in 
      two unrelated families with slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia. The frequency 
      of SCA8 expansion accounts for approximately 4.3 % of the whole pool of our 
      ataxia families (2 out of 46), while none of the 127 controls screened carried > 
      35 CTG+CTA repeats. Our data suggest a possible pathogenetic role of this 
      mutation, which at present is still controversial, and confirm the rarity of the 
      SCA12 expansion in Italian patients.

TI  - Increased (CTG/CAG)(n) lengths in myotonic dystrophy type 1 and Machado-Joseph 
      disease genes in idiopathic azoospermia patients.
PG  - 1578-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increase in CAG trinucleotide repeat length in the androgen 
      receptor (AR) gene has been linked to idiopathic azoospermia. METHODS: In order 
      to test whether other (CAG/CTG)(n) loci are also affected, the (CAG/CTG)(n) 
      frequency distribution at myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), Machado-Joseph disease 
      (MJD), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) and spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 8 (SCA8) loci, in addition to the AR gene, was investigated in 48 
      azoospermia patients and 47 controls. RESULTS: The median CAG repeat length in 
      the AR gene was significantly longer in azoospermia patients than in controls (23 
      versus 21, P < 0.001). Significant differences were also noted in the upper tails 
      of trinucleotide repeat length distributions at both DM1 and MJD loci between the 
      two populations. At the DM1 locus, alleles of more than 18 repeats were observed 
      only in azoospermia patients, and not in controls (P = 0.014). At the MJD locus, 
      the frequency of normal alleles (ANs) with 29 or more CAG repeats was also much 
      higher in azoospermia patients (29.2 versus 7.4%; P = 0.0001). However, the 
      repeat length distribution at DRPLA and SCA8 loci did not differ in the two 
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicated that, at least in a subset of 
      azoospermia patients, there was an increase in the number of trinucleotide 
      repeats in some disease loci. Thus, it is noteworthy to evaluate whether 
      offspring of these azoospermia patients, if born by assisted reproductive 
      technologies, have an increased risk of trinucleotide repeat diseases.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeats in 202 families with ataxia: a small expanded (CAG)n allele 
      at the SCA17 locus.
PG  - 623-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ten neurodegenerative disorders characterized by spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) are known to be caused by trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansions. 
      However, in some instances the molecular diagnosis is considered indeterminate 
      because of the overlap between normal and affected allele ranges. In addition, 
      the mechanism that generates expanded alleles is not completely understood. 
      OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical and molecular characteristics of a large group 
      of Portuguese and Brazilian families with ataxia to improve knowledge of the 
      molecular diagnosis of SCA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have (1) assessed repeat 
      sizes at all known TNR loci implicated in SCA; (2) determined frequency 
      distributions of normal alleles and expansions; and (3) looked at 
      genotype-phenotype correlations in 202 unrelated Portuguese and Brazilian 
      patients with SCA. Molecular analysis of TNR expansions was performed using 
      polymerase chain reaction amplification. RESULTS: Patients from 110 unrelated 
      families with SCA showed TNR expansions at 1 of the loci studied. Dominantly 
      transmitted cases had (CAG)(n) expansions at the Machado-Joseph disease gene 
      (MJD1) (63%), at SCA2 (3%), the gene for dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) (2%), SCA6 (1%), or SCA7 (1%) loci, or (CTG)(n) expansions at the SCA8 
      (2%) gene, whereas (GAA)(n) expansions in the Freidreich ataxia gene (FRDA) were 
      found in 64% of families with recessive ataxia. Isolated patients also had TNR 
      expansions at the MJD1 (6%), SCA8 (6%), or FRDA (8%) genes; in addition, an 
      expanded allele at the TATA-binding protein gene (TBP), with 43 CAGs, was present 
      in a patient with ataxia and mental deterioration. Associations between 
      frequencies of SCA2 and SCA6 and a frequency of large normal alleles were found 
      in Portuguese and Brazilian individuals, respectively. Interestingly, no 
      association between the frequencies of DRPLA and large normal alleles was found 
      in the Portuguese group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that (1) a significant 
      number of isolated cases of ataxia are due to TNR expansions; (2) expanded DRPLA 
      alleles in Portuguese families may have evolved from an ancestral haplotype; and 
      (3) small (CAG)(n) expansions at the TBP gene may cause SCA17.

TI  - Spastic paraplegia, ataxia, mental retardation (SPAR): a novel genetic disorder.
PG  - 411-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a kindred with a dominantly inherited neurologic disorder 
      manifested either as uncomplicated spastic paraplegia or ataxia, spastic 
      paraplegia, and mental retardation. METHODS: Neurologic examinations and 
      molecular genetic analysis (exclusion of known SCA and HSP genes and loci; and 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion detection [RED]) were performed in six affected 
      and four unaffected subjects in this family. MRI, electromyography (EMG), and 
      nerve conduction studies were performed in three affected subjects. RESULTS: The 
      phenotype of this dominantly inherited syndrome varied in succeeding generations. 
      Pure spastic paraplegia was present in the earliest generation; subsequent 
      generations had ataxia and mental retardation. MRI showed marked atrophy of the 
      spinal cord in all patients and cerebellar atrophy in those with ataxia. 
      Laboratory analysis showed that the disorder was not caused by mutations in genes 
      that cause SCA-1, SCA-2, SCA-3, SCA-6, SCA-7, SCA-8, and SCA-12; not linked to 
      other known loci for autosomal dominant ataxia (SCA-4, SCA-5, SCA-10, SCA-11, 
      SCA-13, SCA-14, and SCA-16); and not linked to known loci for autosomal dominant 
      hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (SPG-3, SPG-4, SPG-6, SPG-8, SPG-9, SPG-10, 
      SPG-12, and SPG-13) or autosomal recessive HSP SPG-7. Analysis of 
      intergenerational differences in age at onset of symptoms suggests genetic 
      anticipation. Using RED, the authors did not detect expanded CAG, CCT, TGG, or 
      CGT repeats that segregate with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The authors describe an 
      unusual, dominantly inherited neurologic disorder in which the phenotype (pure 
      spastic paraplegia or spastic ataxia with variable mental retardation) differed 
      in subsequent generations. The molecular explanation for apparent genetic 
      anticipation does not appear to involve trinucleotide repeat expansion.

TI  - Is the 31 CAG repeat allele of the spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) gene locus 
      non-specifically associated with trinucleotide expansion diseases?
PG  - 201-5
AB  - A number of human hereditary neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders are 
      caused by the expansion of trinucleotide repeats within certain genes. The 
      molecular mechanisms that underlie these expansions are not yet known. We have 
      analyzed six trinucleotide repeat-containing loci [spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA1, 
      SCA3, SCA8), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), Huntington chorea (HD) 
      and fragile X syndrome (FRAXA)] in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) patients (n = 
      52). As controls, we analyzed two groups of subjects: healthy control subjects (n 
      =133), and a group of patients with non-triplet neuromuscular diseases (n = 68) 
      caused by point mutations, deletions or duplications (spinal muscular atrophy, 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 1A, hereditary neuropathy with liability to 
      pressure palsies, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy). Allele frequency 
      distributions for all tested loci were similar in these three groups with the 
      exception of the SCA1 locus. In DM1 patients, the SCA1 allele with 31 CAG repeats 
      account for 40.4% of all chromosomes tested, which is significantly higher than 
      in two other groups (11.3% in healthy controls and 6.6% in the group of 
      non-triplet diseased patients; P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). This is 
      consistent with our previous findings in HD patients. The absence of this 
      association in non-triplet diseases as well as in healthy controls could indicate 
      a possible role of this SCA1 allele with 31 repeats in triplet diseases. Here we 
      discuss a possible role of the SCA1 region in pathological trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions.

TI  - Genetic and clinical analysis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 repeat expansion 
      in Italy.
PG  - 1856-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are clinically heterogeneous 
      disorders caused by triplet repeat expansions in the sequence of specific disease 
      genes. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8), originally described in a family 
      characterized by pure cerebellar ataxia with slow disease progression, presents 
      with expansion of combined CTA/CTG repeats. OBJECTIVE: To perform SCA8 repeat 
      expansion analysis in a heterogeneous group of ataxic patients, to determine the 
      prevalence of this mutation in our patients and establish the frequency of 
      expanded CTA/CTG repeats in a large group of control subjects. PATIENTS: One 
      hundred sixty-seven patients affected by sporadic, autosomal dominant and 
      recessive hereditary ataxia were clinically examined and analyzed for SCA8 
      expansion. We further studied 161 control subjects and 125 patients with 
      psychiatric disorders. RESULTS: We found abnormally expanded CTA/CTG repeats in 5 
      ataxic patients, 3 of them characterized by pure cerebellar ataxia. One patient 
      had vitamin E deficiency and 1 patient with a sporadic case was affected by 
      gluten ataxia. No evidence of expanded alleles was found in healthy control 
      subjects and in patients with psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Our data 
      support the evidence that CTG expansions may be linked to SCA8, since the 
      pathogenic expansions have been found only among patients with genetically 
      unidentified forms of hereditary and sporadic ataxia. Patients carrying expanded 
      alleles present peculiar phenotypic features, thus suggesting that unknown 
      additional factors could probably predispose to the disease.

TI  - SCA8 repeat expansions in ataxia: a controversial association.
PG  - 1310-2
AB  - The observation of large SCA8 alleles in healthy control subjects and nonataxic 
      patients, together with a lack of segregation of the expanded repeat with ataxia 
      in several families, has raised questions about the pathogenic role of the SCA8 
      expansion. The authors found allele sizes within the proposed pathogenic range in 
      three patients with ataxia of unknown etiology, in two individuals from pedigrees 
      with either SCA2 or Friedreich's ataxia, and in two patients with Alzheimer's 
      disease. Sizing of SCA8 alleles should not be a routine diagnostic test until its 
      etiologic role is clarified and the pathogenic threshold is determined.

TI  - Frequency analysis of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias in Taiwanese patients 
      and clinical and molecular characterization of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6.
PG  - 1105-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders. The mutational basis for most of these disorders is 
      an expanded CAG repeat sequence within the coding regions of the genes involved. 
      The prevalence of SCA in the ethnic Chinese on Taiwan remains unclear. Moreover, 
      there has been no report of SCA type 6 (SCA6) among Chinese people. OBJECTIVES: 
      To characterize the prevalence of SCA in the ethnic Chinese on Taiwan, and to 
      specifically characterize Chinese patients with SCA6 in terms of clinical and 
      molecular features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a molecular approach, we 
      investigated SCA in 74 Taiwanese families with dominantly inherited ataxias and 
      in 49 Taiwanese patients with sporadic ataxias. Clinical and molecular features 
      of SCA6 were further characterized in 12 patients from 8 families and in 2 
      sporadic cases. Furthermore, the intragenic polymorphic marker D19S1150 was 
      amplified by polymerase chain reaction to analyze for linkage disequilibrium. 
      RESULTS: Machado-Joseph disease-SCA3 was the most common type of autosomal 
      dominant SCA in the Taiwanese cohort, accounting for 35 cases (47.3%), followed 
      by SCA6 (8 [10.8%]), SCA2 (8 [10.8%]), SCA1 (4 [5.4%]), SCA7 (2 [2.7%]), 
      dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (1 [1.4%]), and SCA8 (0%). The genes 
      responsible for 16 (21.6%) of Taiwanese dominantly inherited SCA cases remain to 
      be determined. Among the 49 patients with sporadic ataxias in the present series, 
      2 (4.1%) were found to harbor SCA6 mutations. In the families with SCA6, we found 
      significant anticipation in the absence of genetic instability on transmission, 
      indicating that some other mechanism might account for the anticipation. The same 
      frequent allele of the intragenic DNA marker (D19S1150) was shared by 7 of 10 
      Taiwanese families with SCA6. CONCLUSIONS: Although SCA6 has, so far, not been 
      reported in mainland Chinese, we found a geographic cluster of families with SCA6 
      on Taiwan. Genotyping studies suggest a founder effect in the Taiwanese patients 
      with SCA6.

TI  - Clinical features and genetic analysis of a new form of spinocerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 234-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a clinically 
      heterogeneous group of disorders. The mutations for SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, 
      SCA8, and SCA-12 are identified and caused by an expansion of a CAG or a CTG 
      repeat sequence of these genes. Six additional loci for SCA4, SCA5, SCA-10, 
      SCA-11, SCA-13, and SCA-14 are mapped. The growing heterogeneity of the autosomal 
      dominant forms of these diseases shows that the genetic etiologies of at least 
      20% of ADCA have yet to be elucidated. METHODS: The authors ascertained and 
      clinically characterized a four-generation pedigree segregating an autosomal 
      dominant phenotype for SCA. Direct mutation analysis, repeat expansion detection 
      analysis, and linkage analysis for all known SCA loci were performed. RESULTS: 
      Direct mutational analysis excluded SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 12; genetic linkage 
      analysis excluded SCA4, 5,10, 11, 13, and 14, giving significant negative lod 
      scores. Examination of the family showed that all affected members had gait 
      ataxia and akinesia with variable features of dysarthria, hyporeflexia, and mild 
      intellectual impairment. Eye movements were normal. Head MRI showed atrophy of 
      the cerebellum without involvement of the brainstem. In 10 parent-child pairs, 
      median onset occurred 10.5 years earlier in offspring than in their parents, 
      suggesting anticipation. CONCLUSION: This family is distinct from other families 
      with SCA and is characterized by cerebellar ataxia and extrapyramidal signs.

TI  - Detection of expansion regions in Portuguese bipolar families.
PG  - 854-7
AB  - We have studied 24 families with multiple affected members with bipolar disorder 
      to test the hypothesis that in those families clinically showing genetic 
      anticipation [Macedo et al., 1999] we would find large repeat expansions. The 
      families meeting inclusion criteria had a minimum of two affected members over 
      two generations and showed marked anticipation both in terms of age of onset and 
      disease severity. We used the repeat expansion detection (RED) method to test 
      patients (n = 24) and controls from these families and unrelated controls (n = 
      53). We also genotyped patients and family members from two families with large 
      expansions at the known expansion loci on chromosomes 13, 17, and 18. The RED 
      method revealed a higher number of large expansions in patients compared with 
      controls (t-test; P < 0.0055: Mann-Whitney U; P = 0.02). The patients with the 
      largest expansions were typed at the specific loci on chromosomes 13, 17, and 18 
      and the chromosome 18 expansion locus segregated with disease in one family, and 
      a second family showed segregation with the expansion located at the SCA8 locus 
      on chromosome 13. Genetic anticipation had been analyzed in this cohort of 
      families, with correction for potential ascertainment bias, possible proband 
      effects, cohort effects, regression to the mean, gender effects, and maternal vs. 
      paternal transmission. None of these potential confounds appeared to account for 
      the observed anticipation. We also identified that the presence of large 
      expansions in affected family members derives primarily from two families from 
      the genetically isolated Azores population. One family shows segregation with the 
      chromosome 18 locus, whereas the other family segregates with expansions at the 
      SCA8 locus. Am. J. Med. Genet. (Neuropsychiatr. Genet.) 96:854-857, 2000.

TI  - Asymptomatic CTG expansion at the SCA8 locus is associated with cerebellar 
      atrophy on MRI.
PG  - 76-9
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is the first example of dominantly inherited 
      ataxia reported to be caused by a dynamic mutation of the untranslated CTG 
      trinucleotide repeat. We performed genetic and clinical analyses of a family with 
      an isolated case with young onset cerebellar ataxia carrying an expanded 95 
      CTA/CTG repeats, and revealed that the asymptomatic father was also carrying a 
      much greater expansion of 136 repeats. This paternal transmission developed a 
      large contraction of -41 CTG repeats. The ataxia patient showed almost pure 
      cerebellar symptoms, and a cerebral MRI of the patient demonstrated significant 
      atrophy of the cerebellar vermis and hemispheres with preservation of brainstem 
      and cerebrum. Although the father did not show any neurological abnormalities, 
      his MRI demonstrated mild atrophy of the cerebellar hemispheres. The genetic 
      phenomenon on this family has not been observed in other types of SCAs, and this 
      reduced penetrance may cause reproduction of sporadic SCA8 frequently. Therefore, 
      we must perform careful interviews regarding family history, and suggest the 
      genetic and neuroradiological investigations on family members when we encounter 
      a sporadic patient with the CTG expansion at the SCA8 locus.

TI  - Genetic background of apparently idiopathic sporadic cerebellar ataxia.
PG  - 132-7
AB  - Disease-causing mutations have been identified in various entities of autosomal 
      dominant ataxia and in Friedreich's ataxia. However, no molecular pathogenic 
      factor is known to cause idiopathic cerebellar ataxias. We investigated the 
      CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats causing spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 
      8 and 12, and the GAA repeat of the frataxin gene in 124 patients apparently 
      suffering from idiopathic sporadic ataxia, including 20 patients with the 
      clinical diagnosis of multiple system atrophy. Patients with a positive family 
      history, a typical Friedreich phenotype, or symptomatic ataxia were excluded. 
      Genetic analyses uncovered the most common Friedreich mutation in 10 patients 
      with an age at onset between 13 and 36 years. The SCA6 mutation was present in 
      nine patients with disease onset between 47 and 68 years of age. The CTG repeat 
      associated with SCA8 was expanded in three patients. One patient had SCA2 
      attributable to a de novo mutation from a paternally transmitted, intermediate 
      allele. We did not identify the SCA1, SCA3, SCA7 or SCA12 mutation in idiopathic 
      sporadic ataxia patients. No trinucleotide repeat expansion was detected in the 
      MSA subgroup. This study has revealed the genetic basis in 19% of apparently 
      idiopathic ataxia patients. SCA6 is the most frequent mutation in late onset 
      cerebellar ataxia. The frataxin trinucleotide expansion should be investigated in 
      all sporadic ataxia patients with onset before age 40, even when the phenotype is 
      atypical for Friedreich's ataxia.

TI  - Clinical and genetic findings in Finnish ataxia patients with the spinocerebellar 
      ataxia 8 repeat expansion.
PG  - 354-61
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 8 (SCA8) is caused by a CTG repeat expansion in an 
      untranslated region of a recently cloned gene on 13q21. The pathogenic role of 
      this trinucleotide repeat was evaluated by examining 154 Finnish ataxia patients 
      and 448 controls. Expansions ranging from 100 to 675 repeats were present in 9 
      (6%) unrelated patients and in 13 (3%) controls. There was a threefold excess of 
      shorter expansions (<204 repeats) in the ataxia series, and the expansions tended 
      to cluster in patients with a family history for the disease. Clinical and 
      genetic data were subsequently collected from 15 patients. Common initial 
      symptoms included gait instability, dysarthria, and tremor. A marked cerebellar 
      atrophy in magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography was found in all 
      patients. Pyramidal affection was often seen, and various kinds of cognitive 
      impairment were evident in 40% of patients. Disease progression was slow, and 
      fluctuation of symptoms was commonly observed. A maternal penetrance bias was not 
      seen, nor was there any clear-cut negative correlation between age of onset and 
      repeat number. Meiotic but not mitotic instability of the repeat expansion was 
      evident. Haplotype analysis suggests multiple origins for the Finnish 
      spinocerebellar ataxia 8 repeat expansions.

TI  - SCA8 CTG repeat: en masse contractions in sperm and intergenerational sequence 
      changes may play a role in reduced penetrance.
PG  - 2125-30
AB  - We recently described an untranslated CTG expansion that causes a previously 
      undescribed form of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA8). The SCA8 CTG repeat is 
      preceded by a polymorphic but stable CTA tract, with the configuration 
      (CTA)(1-21)(CTG)(n). The CTG portion of the repeat is elongated on pathogenic 
      alleles, which nearly always change in size when transmitted from generation to 
      generation. To better understand the reduced penetrance and maternal penetrance 
      bias associated with SCA8 we analyzed the sequence configurations and instability 
      patterns of the CTG repeat in affected and unaffected family members. In contrast 
      to other triplet repeat diseases, expanded alleles found in affected SCA8 
      individuals can have either a pure uninterrupted CTG repeat tract or an allele 
      with one or more CCG, CTA, CTC, CCA or CTT interruptions. Surprisingly, we found 
      six different sequence configurations of the CTG repeat on expanded alleles in a 
      seven generation family. In two instances duplication of CCG interruptions 
      occurred over a single generation and in other instances duplications that had 
      occurred in different branches of the family could be inferred. We also evaluated 
      SCA8 instability in sperm samples from individuals with expansions ranging in 
      size from 80 to 800 repeats in blood. Surprisingly the SCA8 repeat tract in sperm 
      underwent contractions, with nearly all of the resulting expanded alleles having 
      repeat lengths of <100 CTGs, a size that is not often associated with disease. 
      These en masse repeat contractions in sperm likely underlie the reduced 
      penetrance associated with paternal transmission.

TI  - Prevalence of triplet repeat expansion in ataxia patients from Hokkaido, the 
      northernmost island of Japan.
PG  - 45-51
AB  - Approximately 44% of cases of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) in Hokkaido, the 
      northernmost island of Japan, were estimated to be inherited. To determine the 
      prevalence of triplet repeat expansion in hereditary SCA patients, we genotyped 
      seven genetically defined dominant SCAs in 349 patients, including 266 patients 
      from 77 families, 78 probands from unrelated families with hereditary late-onset 
      SCA, and five patients in whom a family history of SCA was not demonstrated. The 
      frequency of each disorder in a total of 155 unrelated families was 23.9% for 
      Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), 29.0% for SCA6, 9.7% for SCA1, 7.7% for SCA2, and 
      2.6% for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy. Abnormal expansion of triplet 
      repeats for SCA7 and SCA8 was not detected. A total of 27.1% of the patients had 
      still unknown SCA mutations. In addition, the GAA repeat in the frataxin gene was 
      not abnormally expanded in 13 early-onset SCA patients with clinical features 
      similar to those of Friedreich ataxia. Comparison of our results with those from 
      other centers handling SCA showed that MJD is prevalent throughout Japan, but the 
      frequencies of other dominant SCAs differ considerably even within Japan.

TI  - An unstable trinucleotide-repeat region on chromosome 13 implicated in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia: a common expansion locus.
PG  - 819-29
AB  - Larger CAG/CTG trinucleotide-repeat tracts in individuals affected with 
      schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) in comparison with 
      control individuals have previously been reported, implying a possible 
      etiological role for trinucleotide repeats in these diseases. Two unstable 
      CAG/CTG repeats, SEF2-1B and ERDA1, have recently been cloned, and studies 
      indicate that the majority of individuals with large repeats as detected by 
      repeat-expansion detection (RED) have large repeat alleles at these loci. These 
      repeats do not show association of large alleles with either BPAD or SCZ. Using 
      RED, we have identified a BPAD individual with a very large CAG/CTG repeat that 
      is not due to expansion at SEF2-1B or ERDA1. From this individual's DNA, we have 
      cloned a highly polymorphic trinucleotide repeat consisting of (CTA)n (CTG)n, 
      which is very long ( approximately 1,800 bp) in this patient. The repeat region 
      localizes to chromosome 13q21, within 1.2 cM of fragile site FRA13C. Repeat 
      alleles in our sample were unstable in 13 (5.6%) of 231 meioses. Large alleles 
      (>100 repeats) were observed in 14 (1. 25%) of 1,120 patients with psychosis, 
      borderline personality disorder, or juvenile-onset depression and in 5 (.7%) of 
      710 healthy controls. Very large alleles were also detected for Centre d'Etude 
      Polymorphisme Humaine (CEPH) reference family 1334. This triplet expansion has 
      recently been reported to be the cause of spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8); 
      however, none of our large alleles above the disease threshold occurred in 
      individuals either affected by SCA or with known family history of SCA. The high 
      frequency of large alleles at this locus is inconsistent with the much rarer 
      occurrence of SCA8. Thus, it seems unlikely that expansion alone causes SCA8; 
      other genetic mechanisms may be necessary to explain SCA8 etiology.

TI  - Molecular and clinical analyses of spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 in Japan.
PG  - 950-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the molecular and clinical features of the newly identified 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8). METHODS: We analyzed the CTG repeat region 
      of the SCA8 gene in a series of Japanese patients with cerebellar ataxia. We also 
      investigated the frequency of the CTG repeat length in Japanese normal elderly 
      subjects older than age 79. Morphometric measurements on the cerebral MRI were 
      compared between patients with SCA8 and SCA6. RESULTS: The number of the combined 
      CTA/CTG repeats of six affected SCA8 alleles was 106.3+/-24.4 (mean +/- SD) 
      ranging from 89 to 155 and that of normal elderly subjects was 24.3+/-4.4 (n = 
      104 alleles) ranging from 15 to 34. The mean age at onset of the SCA8 cases was 
      53.8+/-19.7 years, with a range from 20 to 73 years. One father and daughter from 
      an SCA8 family showed remarkable paternal anticipation. The number increase from 
      father to daughter was + 16 CTG repeats, with a 31-year acceleration of onset. 
      The six identified SCA8 patients were clinically characterized by high 
      frequencies of incoordination of trunk and limbs, ataxic dysarthria, impaired 
      smooth pursuit, and horizontal nystagmus, and the MRI showed significant atrophy 
      of the cerebellar vermis and hemispheres compared with that of normal controls. 
      There was no significant difference between SCA8 and SCA6 on the morphometric MRI 
      study. CONCLUSIONS: The CTG repeat expansions in the SCA8 alleles were much 
      greater than the range of repeats in normal elderly subjects. The SCA8 phenotype 
      manifested by cerebellar symptoms and atrophy corresponded to features of the 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type III (ADCA III).

      (SCA8).

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the only disease reported to be caused by a CTG 
      expansion. We now report that a non-coding CTG expansion causes a novel form of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA8). This expansion, located on chromosome 13q21, was 
      isolated directly from the genomic DNA of an ataxia patient by RAPID cloning. 
      SCA8 patients have expansions similar in size (107-127 CTG repeats) to those 
      found among adult-onset DM patients. SCA8 is the first example of a dominant SCA 
      not caused by a CAG expansion translated as a polyglutamine tract.
