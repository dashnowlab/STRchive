AB  - There is an obvious clinical-pathological overlap between essential tremor and 
      some known tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansion disorders. The aim is 
      to analyse whether these short tandem repeat genes, including ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, TBP, BEAN1, NOP56, DAB1, ATN1, 
      SADM12 and FMR1, are associated with familial essential tremor patients. Genetic 
      analysis of repeat sizes in tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansions was 
      performed in a large cohort of 515 familial essential tremor probands and 300 
      controls. The demographic and clinical features among carriers of pathogenic 
      expansions, intermediate repeats and non-carriers were compared. A total of 18 
      out of 515 (18/515, 3.7%) patients were found to have repeats expansions, 
      including 12 cases (12/515, 2.5%) with intermediate repeat expansions (one ATXN1, 
      eight TBP, two FMR1, one ATN1), and six cases (6/515, 1.2%) with pathogenic 
      expansions (one ATXN1, one ATXN2, one ATXN8OS, one PPP2R2B, one FMR1, one 
      SAMD12). There were no statistically significant differences in intermediate 
      repeats compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, there were no significant 
      differences in demographics and clinical features among individuals with 
      pathogenic expansions, intermediate repeat expansions carriers and non-carriers. 
      Our study indicates that the intermediate repeat expansion in tremor-associated 
      short tandem repeat expansions does not pose an increased risk for essential 
      tremor, and rare pathogenic expansion carriers have been found in the familial 
      essential tremor cohort. The diagnosis of essential tremor based solely on 
      clinical symptoms remains a challenge in distinguishing it from known short 
      tandem repeat expansions diseases with overlapping clinical-pathological 
      features.

TI  - Insights into familial adult myoclonus epilepsy pathogenesis: How the same repeat 
      expansion in six unrelated genes may lead to cortical excitability.
PG  - S31-S38
LID - 10.1111/epi.17504 [doi]
AB  - Familial adult myoclonus epilepsy (FAME) results from the same pathogenic 
      TTTTA/TTTCA pentanucleotide repeat expansion in six distinct genes encoding 
      proteins with different subcellular localizations and very different functions, 
      which poses the issue of what causes the neurobiological disturbances that lead 
      to the clinical phenotype. Postmortem and electrophysiological studies have 
      pointed to cortical hyperexcitability as well as dysfunction and 
      neurodegeneration of both the cortex and cerebellum of FAME subjects. FAME 
      expansions, contrary to the same expansion in DAB1 causing spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 37, seem to have no or limited impact on their recipient gene expression, 
      which suggests a pathophysiological mechanism independent of the gene and its 
      function. Current hypotheses include toxicity of the RNA molecules carrying UUUCA 
      repeats, or toxicity of polypeptides encoded by the repeats, a mechanism known as 
      repeat-associated non-AUG translation. The analysis of postmortem brains of FAME1 
      expansion (in SAMD12) carriers has revealed the presence of RNA foci that could 
      be formed by the aggregation of RNA molecules with abnormal UUUCA repeats, but 
      evidence is still lacking for other FAME subtypes. Even when the expansion is 
      located in a gene ubiquitously expressed, expression of repeats remains 
      undetectable in peripheral tissues (blood, skin). Therefore, the development of 
      appropriate cellular models (induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons) or 
      the study of affected tissues in patients is required to elucidate how FAME 
      repeat expansions located in unrelated genes lead to disease.

PG  - 2427-2439
LID - 10.1002/mds.29221 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coding and noncoding repeat expansions are an important cause of 
      neurodegenerative diseases. OBJECTIVE: This study determined the clinical and 
      genetic features of a large German family that has been followed for almost 2 
      decades with an autosomal dominantly inherited spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) and 
      independent co-occurrence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD). METHODS: We carried out clinical examinations and 
      telephone interviews, reviewed medical records, and performed magnetic resonance 
      imaging and positron emission tomography scans of all available family members. 
      Comprehensive genetic investigations included linkage analysis, short-read genome 
      sequencing, long-read sequencing, repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction, and 
      Southern blotting. RESULTS: The family comprises 118 members across seven 
      generations, 30 of whom were definitely and five possibly affected. In this 
      family, two different pathogenic mutations were found, a heterozygous repeat 
      expansion in C9ORF72 in four patients with ALS/FTD and a heterozygous repeat 
      expansion in DAB1 in at least nine patients with SCA, leading to a diagnosis of 
      DAB1-related ataxia (ATX-DAB1; SCA37). One patient was affected by ALS and SCA 
      and carried both repeat expansions. The repeat in DAB1 had the same configuration 
      but was larger than those previously described ([ATTTT]( approximately 75) [ATTTC]( approximately 40-100) 
      [ATTTT]( approximately 415) ). Clinical features in patients with SCA included spinocerebellar 
      symptoms, sometimes accompanied by additional ophthalmoplegia, vertical 
      nystagmus, tremor, sensory deficits, and dystonia. After several decades, some of 
      these patients suffered from cognitive decline and one from additional 
      nonprogressive lower motor neuron affection. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate genetic 
      and clinical findings during an 18-year period in a unique family carrying two 
      different pathogenic repeat expansions, providing novel insights into their 
      genotypic and phenotypic spectrums. (c) 2022 The Authors. Movement Disorders

TI  - ATTCT and ATTCC repeat expansions in the ATXN10 gene affect disease penetrance of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 10.
PG  - 100137
LID - 10.1016/j.xhgg.2022.100137 [doi]
LID - 100137
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal-dominant disorder caused 
      by an expanded pentanucleotide repeat in the ATXN10 gene. This repeat expansion, 
      when fully penetrant, has a size of 850-4,500 repeats. It has been shown that the 
      repeat composition can be a modifier of disease, e.g., seizures. Here, we 
      describe a Mexican kindred in which we identified both pure (ATTCT)(n) and mixed 
      (ATTCT)(n)-(ATTCC)(n) expansions in the same family. We used amplification-free 
      targeted sequencing and optical genome mapping to decipher the composition of 
      these repeat expansions. We found a considerable degree of mosaicism of the 
      repeat expansion. This mosaicism was confirmed in skin fibroblasts from 
      individuals with ATXN10 expansions with RNAScope in situ hybridization. All 
      affected family members with the mixed ATXN10 repeat expansion showed typical 
      clinical signs of spinocerebellar ataxia and epilepsy. In contrast, individuals 
      with the pure ATXN10 expansion present with Parkinson's disease or are 
      unaffected, even in individuals more than 20 years older than the average age at 
      onset for SCA10. Our findings suggest that the pure (ATTCT)(n) expansion is 
      non-pathogenic, while repeat interruptions, e.g., (ATTCC)(n), are necessary to 
      cause SCA10. This mechanism has been recently described for several other repeat 
      expansions including SCA31 (BEAN1), SCA37 (DAB1), and three loci for benign adult 
      familial myoclonic epilepsy BAFME (SAMD12, TNRC6A, RAPGEF2). Therefore, long-read 
      sequencing and optical genome mapping of the entire genomic structure of repeat 
      expansions are critical for clinical practice and genetic counseling, as 
      variations in the repeat can affect disease penetrance, symptoms, and disease 
      trajectory.

TI  - Prevalence of RFC1-mediated spinocerebellar ataxia in a North American ataxia 
      cohort.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the prevalence of pathogenic repeat expansions in 
      replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) and disabled adaptor protein 1 (DAB1) in an 
      undiagnosed ataxia cohort from North America. METHODS: A cohort of 596 
      predominantly adult-onset patients with undiagnosed familial or sporadic 
      cerebellar ataxia was evaluated at a tertiary referral ataxia center and excluded 
      for common genetic causes of cerebellar ataxia. Patients were then screened for 
      the presence of pathogenic repeat expansions in RFC1 (AAGGG) and DAB1 (ATTTC) 
      using fluorescent repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). Two additional undiagnosed ataxia 
      cohorts from different centers, totaling 302 and 13 patients, respectively, were 
      subsequently screened for RFC1, resulting in a combined 911 subjects tested. 
      RESULTS: In the initial cohort, 41 samples were identified with 1 expanded allele 
      in the RFC1 gene (6.9%), and 9 had 2 expanded alleles (1.5%). For the additional 
      cohorts, we found 20 heterozygous samples (6.6%) and 17 biallelic samples (5.6%) 
      in the larger cohort and 1 heterozygous sample (7.7%) and 3 biallelic samples 
      (23%) in the second. In total, 29 patients were identified with biallelic repeat 
      expansions in RFC1 (3.2%). Of these 29 patients, 8 (28%) had a clinical diagnosis 
      of cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), 14 
      had cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy (48%), 4 had pure cerebellar ataxia (14%), 
      and 3 had spinocerebellar ataxia (10%). No patients were identified with 
      expansions in the DAB1 gene (spinocerebellar ataxia type 37). CONCLUSIONS: In a 
      large undiagnosed ataxia cohort from North America, biallelic pathogenic repeat 
      expansion in RFC1 was observed in 3.2%. Testing should be strongly considered in 
      patients with ataxia, especially those with CANVAS or neuropathy.

TI  - Mutational mechanism for DAB1 (ATTTC)(n) insertion in SCA37: ATTTT repeat 
      lengthening and nucleotide substitution.
PG  - 404-412
LID - 10.1002/humu.23704 [doi]
AB  - Dynamic mutations by microsatellite instability are the molecular basis of a 
      growing number of neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases. Repetitive 
      stretches in the human genome may drive pathogenicity, either by expansion above 
      a given threshold, or by insertion of abnormal tracts in nonpathogenic 
      polymorphic repetitive regions, as is the case in spinocerebellar ataxia type 37 
      (SCA37). We have recently established that this neurodegenerative disease is 
      caused by an (ATTTC)(n) insertion within an (ATTTT)(n) in a noncoding region of 
      DAB1. We now investigated the mutational mechanism that originated the (ATTTC)(n) 
      insertion within an ancestral (ATTTT)(n) . Approximately 3% of nonpathogenic 
      (ATTTT)(n) alleles are interspersed by AT-rich motifs, contrarily to mutant 
      alleles that are composed of pure (ATTTT)(n) and (ATTTC)(n) stretches. Haplotype 
      studies in unaffected chromosomes suggested that the primary mutational 
      mechanism, leading to the (ATTTC)(n) insertion, was likely one or more T>C 
      substitutions in an (ATTTT)(n) pure allele of approximately 200 repeats. Then, 
      the (ATTTC)(n) expanded in size, originating a deleterious allele in DAB1 that 
      leads to SCA37. This is likely the mutational mechanism in three similar 
      (TTTCA)(n) insertions responsible for familial myoclonic epilepsy. Because 
      (ATTTT)(n) tracts are frequent in the human genome, many loci could be at risk 
      for this mutational process.

AB  - Advances in human genetics in recent years have largely been driven by 
      next-generation sequencing (NGS); however, the discovery of disease-related gene 
      mutations has been biased toward the exome because the large and very repetitive 
      regions that characterize the non-coding genome remain difficult to reach by that 
      technology. For autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), 28 genes have 
      been identified, but only five SCAs originate from non-coding mutations. Over 
      half of SCA-affected families, however, remain without a genetic diagnosis. We 
      used genome-wide linkage analysis, NGS, and repeat analysis to identify an 
      (ATTTC)(n) insertion in a polymorphic ATTTT repeat in DAB1 in chromosomal region 
      1p32.2 as the cause of autosomal-dominant SCA; this region has been previously 
      linked to SCA37. The non-pathogenic and pathogenic alleles have the 
      configurations [(ATTTT)(7-400)] and [(ATTTT)(60-79)(ATTTC)(31-75)(ATTTT)(58-90)], 
      respectively. (ATTTC)(n) insertions are present on a distinct haplotype and show 
      an inverse correlation between size and age of onset. In the DAB1-oriented 
      strand, (ATTTC)(n) is located in 5' UTR introns of cerebellar-specific 
      transcripts arising mostly during human fetal brain development from the usage of 
      alternative promoters, but it is maintained in the adult cerebellum. 
      Overexpression of the transfected (ATTTC)(58) insertion, but not (ATTTT)(n), 
      leads to abnormal nuclear RNA accumulation. Zebrafish embryos injected with RNA 
      of the (AUUUC)(58) insertion, but not (AUUUU)(n), showed lethal developmental 
      malformations. Together, these results establish an unstable repeat insertion in 
      DAB1 as a cause of cerebellar degeneration; on the basis of the genetic and 
      phenotypic evidence, we propose this mutation as the molecular basis for SCA37.
