TI  - Description of a family with X-linked oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum 
      associated with polyalanine tract expansion in ZIC3.
PG  - 384-389
LID - 10.1111/cge.13811 [doi]
AB  - Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAVS) [MIM:164210], or Goldenhar syndrome, is 
      a developmental disorder associating defects of structures derived from the first 
      and second branchial arches. The genetic origin of OAVS is supported by the 
      description of rare deleterious variants in a few causative genes, and several 
      chromosomal copy number variations. We describe here a large family with eight 
      male members affected by a mild form of the spectrum, mostly auricular defects, 
      harboring a hemizygous ZIC3 variant detected by familial exome sequencing: 
      c.159_161dup p.(Ala55dup), resulting in an expansion of the normal 10 consecutive 
      alanine residues to 11 alanines. Segregation analysis shows its presence in all 
      the affected individuals, with a recessive X-linked transmission. Whole-genome 
      sequencing performed in another affected male allowed to exclude linkage 
      disequilibrium between this ZIC3 variant and another potential pathogenic variant 
      in this family. Furthermore, by screening of a cohort of 274 OAVS patients, we 
      found 1 male patient carrying an expansion of 10 to 12 alanines, a variant 
      previously reported in patient presenting with VACTERL. Loss-of-function variants 
      of ZIC3 are causing heterotaxy or cardiac malformations. These alanine expansion 
      variants could have a different impact on the protein and thereby resulting in a 
      different phenotype within the OAVS/VACTERL.

TI  - Polyalanine expansion in the ZIC3 gene leading to X-linked heterotaxy with 
      VACTERL association: a new polyalanine disorder?
PG  - 351-5
LID - 10.1136/jmg.2008.060913 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The VACTERL association is a non-random association of congenital 
      defects with an unknown aetiology in the majority of patients. METHODS: A male 
      newborn is reported with features of the VACTERL association, including anal 
      atresia, laryngeal and oesophageal atresia with tracheo-oesophageal fistula, 
      dextroposition of the heart with persistent left superior vena cava, and 
      unilateral multicystic kidney. As the clinical picture of this patient overlaps 
      with that of X-linked heterotaxy caused by ZIC3 mutations, the ZIC3 coding region 
      was sequenced. RESULTS: In a patient with the VACTERL association a 6-nucleotide 
      insertion was found in the GCC repeat of the ZIC3 gene, which is predicted to 
      expand the amino-terminal polyalanine repeat from 10 to 12 polyalanines. The 
      polyalanine expansion is a novel ZIC3 mutation which was not found in 336 
      chromosomes from 192 ethnically matched controls. The mutation was also not 
      present in the mother, suggesting it occurred de novo in the patient and is 
      therefore a pathogenetic mutation. CONCLUSION: It is hypothesized that this novel 
      and de novo polyalanine expansion in ZIC3 contributes to the VACTERL association 
      in this patient. A newborn male is described with features of the VACTERL 
      association, including anal atresia, laryngeal and oesophageal atresia with 
      tracheo-oesophageal fistula, dextroposition of the heart with persistent left 
      superior vena cava, and unilateral multicystic kidney. As the clinical picture of 
      the VACTERL association overlaps with X-linked heterotaxy caused by ZIC3 
      mutations, the ZIC3 coding region was sequenced, and a 6-nucleotide insertion was 
      found that is predicted to expand the amino-terminal polyalanine repeat from 10 
      to 12 polyalanines. This novel mutation was not present in the mother, nor in 336 
      chromosomes from 192 ethnically matched controls. It is hypothesised that this 
      novel and de novo polyalanine expansion in the ZIC3 gene contributes to the 
      VACTERL association in this patient.
