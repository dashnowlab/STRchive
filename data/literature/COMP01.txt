AB  - Autoimmune diseases are characterized by alteration in balance of various 
      cytokines. Rheumatoid arthritis is a well-known inflammatory disease leading to 
      destruction of cartilage at knee and hands. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a 
      common autoimmune model for rheumatoid arthritis study. Here, we have 
      investigated the therapeutic role of medicarpin, a natural pterocarpan with known 
      anti-osteoclastogenic activities, in postmenopausal polyarthritis model of DBA/1J 
      mice. For this, mice were ovariectomized and CIA was induced in OVx animals with 
      primary immunization. After 21 days, booster dose was injected in Ovariectomy 
      (OVx) mice to develop postmenopausal poly-arthritis mice model. Medicarpin 
      treatment in mice at dose of 10.0 mg/kg/body wt was started after 21 days of 
      primary immunization for one month of time period every day orally. We found that 
      medicarpin prevented alteration of TH-17/Treg ratio in CIA model leading to 
      reduced osteoclastogenesis. Micro Computed Tomography (Micro-CT) analysis 
      demonstrated that medicarpin prevents cartilage erosion in joints and restores 
      loss of trabeculae parameters in distal tibia. Treatment with medicarpin also 
      prevented alteration of various cytokines level by down-regulating various 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-17A, while up-regulating 
      anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in CIA model of mice. Biological marker of 
      arthritis is cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). COMP level was 
      up-regulated in CIA induced mice while treatment with medicarpin significantly 
      restored the serum level of COMP compared with untreated groups. Cartilage 
      staining by Safranin-O also indicates that cartilage destruction in joints of CIA 
      mice was prevented by medicarpin treatment. From this study, we can conclude that 
      medicarpin is effective in preventing arthritis in post-menopausal conditions.

TI  - A B-Z junction induced by an A ... A mismatch in GAC repeats in the gene for

AB  - GAC repeat expansion from five to seven in the exonic region of the gene for 
      cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) leads to pseudoachondroplasia, a 
      skeletal abnormality. However, the molecular mechanism by which GAC expansions in 
      the COMP gene lead to skeletal dysplasias is poorly understood. Here we used 
      molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that an A ... A mismatch in a 
      d(GAC)(6).d(GAC)(6) duplex induces negative supercoiling, leading to a local 
      B-to-Z DNA transition. This transition facilitates the binding of 
      d(GAC)(7).d(GAC)(7) with the Zalpha-binding domain of human adenosine deaminase 
      acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1, hZalpha(ADAR1)), as confirmed by CD, NMR, and microscale 
      thermophoresis studies. The CD results indicated that hZalpha(ADAR1) recognizes the 
      zigzag backbone of d(GAC)(7).d(GAC)(7) at the B-Z junction and subsequently 
      converts it into Z-DNA via the so-called passive mechanism. Molecular dynamics 
      simulations carried out for the modeled hZalpha(ADAR1)-d(GAC)(6)d(GAC)(6) complex 
      confirmed the retention of previously reported important interactions between the 
      two molecules. These findings suggest that hZalpha(ADAR1) binding with the GAC 
      hairpin stem in COMP can lead to a non-genetic, RNA editing-mediated substitution 
      in COMP that may then play a crucial role in the development of 
      pseudoachondroplasia.

TI  - Identification of novel and recurrent mutations in the calcium binding type III 
      repeats of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein in patients with 
      pseudoachondroplasia.

AB  - Pseudoachondroplasia is an autosomal dominant osteochondrodysplasia characterized 
      by disproportionate short stature, joint laxity, and early onset osteoarthrosis. 
      Pseudoachondroplasia is caused by mutations in the gene encoding cartilage 
      oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). We looked for mutations in the COMP gene in 
      three sporadic Chinese pseudoachondroplasia patients and identified two novel 
      mutations, c.1189G>T (p.D397Y) and c.1220G>A (p.C407Y), and one recurrent 
      mutation, c.1318G>C (p.G440R), in the calcium binding type III repeats of COMP. 
      This study confirms the relationship between mutations of the COMP gene and 
      clinical findings of pseudoachondroplasia; it also provides evidence for the 
      importance of the calcium binding domains to the functioning of COMP.

AB  - Cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs), which give rise to the most abundant 
      neuronal type in the mammalian brain, arise from a restricted pool of primary 
      progenitors in the rhombic lip (RL). Sonic hedgehog (Shh) secreted by developing 
      Purkinje cells is essential for the expansion of GCPs and for cerebellar 
      morphogenesis. Recent studies have shown that the primary cilium concentrates 
      components of Shh signaling and that this structure is required for Shh 
      signaling. GCPs have a primary cilium on their surface [Del Cerro, M.P., Snider, 
      R.S. (1972). Studies on the developing cerebellum. II. The ultrastructure of the 
      external granular layer. J Comp Neurol 144, 131-64.]. Here, we show that 1) this 
      cilium can be conditionally ablated by crossing Kif3a(fl/-) mice with hGFAP-Cre 
      mice, 2) removal of Kif3a from GCPs disrupts cerebellar development, and 3) these 
      defects are due to a drastic reduction in Shh-dependent expansion of GCPs. A 
      similar phenotype is observed when Smoothened (Smo), an essential transducer of 
      Shh signaling, is removed from the same population of GCPs. Interestingly, 
      Kif3a-Smo double conditional mutants show that Kif3a is epistatic to Smo. This 
      work shows that Kif3a is essential for Shh-dependent expansion of cerebellar 
      progenitors. Dysfunctional cilia are associated with diverse human disorders 
      including Bardet-Biedl and Joubert syndromes. Cerebellar abnormalities observed 
      in these patients could be explained by defects in Shh-induced GCP expansion.

TI  - Structure of a thrombospondin C-terminal fragment reveals a novel calcium core in 
      the type 3 repeats.
PG  - 1223-33
AB  - Thrombospondins (TSPs) are extracellular regulators of cell-matrix interactions 
      and cell phenotype. The most highly conserved region of all TSPs are the 
      calcium-binding type 3 (T3) repeats and the C-terminal globular domain (CTD). The 
      crystal structure of a cell-binding TSP-1 fragment, spanning three T3 repeats and 
      the CTD, reveals a compact assembly. The T3 repeats lack secondary structure and 
      are organised around a core of calcium ions; two DxDxDGxxDxxD motifs per repeat 
      each encapsulate two calcium ions in a novel arrangement. The CTD forms a 
      lectin-like beta-sandwich and contains four strictly conserved calcium-binding 
      sites. Disruption of the hairpin structure of T3 repeats 6 and 7 decreases 
      protein secretion and stability. The availability for cell attachment of an RGD 
      motif in T3 repeat 7 is modulated by calcium loading. The central architectural 
      role of calcium explains how it is critical for the functions of the TSP 
      C-terminal region. Mutations in the T3 repeats of TSP-5/COMP, which cause two 
      human skeletal disorders, are predicted to disrupt the tertiary structure of the 
      T3-CTD assembly.

TI  - Autosomal dominant precocious osteoarthropathy due to a mutation of the cartilage 
      oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) gene: further expansion of the phenotypic 
      variations of COMP defects.
PG  - 730-7
AB  - We report on a Japanese family of four generations with an autosomal dominant 
      precocious osteoarthropathy. The cardinal clinical manifestations of affected 
      individuals were painful weight-bearing large joints, which started in late 
      childhood or adolescence. The radiological hallmarks included coxa plana, mild 
      epiphyseal dysplasia of the knee, and round talar domes with tibiotalar slant in 
      childhood, which evolved into degenerative joint diseases in adulthood. The 
      disease phenotype was cosegregated with a mutation of the cartilage oligomeric 
      matrix protein (COMP) gene in the family members, who underwent molecular 
      evaluation. COMP mutations have been reported in a mild form of multiple 
      epiphyseal dysplasia (MED), Ribbing type, as well as allied disorders with more 
      severe manifestations, such as MED Fairbank type and pseudoachondroplasia. Unlike 
      previously reported cases with the Ribbing type, the present patients did not 
      have short stature or brachydactyly. This report expands further the phenotypic 
      variations of COMP defects.

TI  - Trinucleotide expansion mutations in the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein 
      (COMP) gene.
PG  - 123-8
AB  - Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) are two 
      human autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasias characterized by variable short 
      stature, joint laxity and early-onset degenerative joint disease. Both disorders 
      can result from mut-ations in the gene for cartilage oligomeric matrix protein 
      (COMP), an extracellular matrix glycoprotein. About one-third of PSACH cases 
      result from heterozygosity for deletion of one codon within a very short triplet 
      repeat, (GAC)5, which encodes five consecutive aspartic acid residues within the 
      calmodulin-like region of the COMP protein. We have identified two expansion 
      mut-ations in this repeat: an MED patient carrying a (GAC)6allele and a PSACH 
      patient carrying a (GAC)7allele. These are among the shortest disease-causing 
      triplet repeat expansion mutations described thus far, and are the first 
      identified in a GAC repeat. A unique feature of this sequence is that expansion 
      as well as shortening of the repeat can cause the same disease. In cartilage, 
      both patients have rough endoplasmic reticulum inclusions in chondrocytes. The 
      inclusions are also present in tendon tissue and can be reproduced in cultured 
      tendon cells, suggesting that the pathophysiology of disease is similar in both 
      cartilage and tendon.
