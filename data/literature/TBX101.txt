TI  - Mammalian TBX1 preferentially binds and regulates downstream targets via a tandem 
      T-site repeat.

AB  - Haploinsufficiency or mutation of TBX1 is largely responsible for the etiology of 
      physical malformations in individuals with velo-cardio-facial/DiGeorge syndrome 
      (VCFS/DGS/22q11.2 deletion syndrome). TBX1 encodes a transcription factor protein 
      that contains an evolutionarily conserved DNA binding domain termed the T-box 
      that is shared with other family members. All T-box proteins, examined so far, 
      bind to similar but not identical consensus DNA sequences, indicating that they 
      have specific binding preferences. To identify the TBX1 specific consensus 
      sequence, Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) was 
      performed. In contrast to other TBX family members recognizing palindrome 
      sequences, we found that TBX1 preferentially binds to a tandem repeat of 
      5'-AGGTGTGAAGGTGTGA-3'. We also identified a second consensus sequence comprised 
      of a tandem repeat with a degenerated downstream site. We show that three known 
      human disease-causing TBX1 missense mutations (F148Y, H194Q and G310S) do not 
      alter nuclear localization, or disrupt binding to the tandem repeat consensus 
      sequences, but they reduce transcriptional activity in cell culture reporter 
      assays. To identify Tbx1-downstream genes, we performed an in silico genome wide 
      analysis of potential cis-acting elements in DNA and found strong enrichment of 
      genes required for developmental processes and transcriptional regulation. We 
      found that TBX1 binds to 19 different loci in vitro, which may correspond to 
      putative cis-acting binding sites. In situ hybridization coupled with luciferase 
      gene reporter assays on three gene loci, Fgf8, Bmper, Otog-MyoD, show that these 
      motifs are directly regulated by TBX1 in vitro. Collectively, the present studies 
      establish new insights into molecular aspects of TBX1 binding to DNA. This work 
      lays the groundwork for future in vivo studies, including chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to further 
      elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of VCFS/DGS.

TI  - Timed mutation and cell-fate mapping reveal reiterated roles of Tbx1 during 
      embryogenesis, and a crucial function during segmentation of the pharyngeal 
      system via regulation of endoderm expansion.
PG  - 4387-95
AB  - The definition of time-specific requirements for a developmental gene can 
      pinpoint the processes within which the gene is involved and can reveal potential 
      late functions in structures and organs that fail to develop in germline mutants. 
      Here, we show the first systematic time-course deletion, in parallel with timed 
      cell fate mapping, of a developmentally crucial gene, Tbx1, during mouse 
      embryogenesis. Tbx1 mouse mutants model DiGeorge syndrome, a disorder of 
      pharyngeal and cardiovascular development. Results revealed different time 
      requirements for the development of individual structures, as well as multiple 
      and time-distinct roles during the development of the same organ or system. We 
      also show that Tbx1 is required throughout pharyngeal segmentation for the 
      regulation of endoderm expansion, thus this is the first gene implicated directly 
      in this process. A genetic-based blueprint of crucial developmental times for 
      organs and systems should be a valuable asset for our understanding of birth 
      defect pathogenesis.

TI  - Patient with a 22q11.2 deletion with no overlap of the minimal DiGeorge syndrome 
      critical region (MDGCR).
PG  - 27-33
AB  - The apparent lack of genotype/phenotype correlation in patients with the DiGeorge 
      anomaly and velocardiofacial syndrome (DGA/VCFS; the "22q11 deletion syndrome") 
      indicates a complex genetic condition. Most cases, whatever the phenotype, have a 
      1.5-3 Mb chromosomal deletion that includes the minimal DiGeorge critical region 
      (MDGCR). Another potential critical region on 22q11 has been suggested based on 
      two patients with distal deletions outside the MDGCR. We report on a patient with 
      a VCFS phenotype who has a deletion, mapped by short tandem repeat polymorphic 
      loci and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, distal to and not 
      overlapping the MDGCR. This patient is deleted for several genes, including the 
      T-box 1 gene (TBX1; a transcription regulator expressed early in embryogenesis) 
      and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT; involved in neurotransmitter metabolism). 
      We discuss the role these two genes may play in the clinical phenotype of the 
      patient.
