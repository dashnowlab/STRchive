AB  - Amoebiasis, caused by the enteric parasite, Entamoeba histolytica, is one of the 
      major food- and water-borne parasitic diseases in developing countries with 
      improper sanitation and poor hygiene. Infection with E. histolytica has diverse 
      disease outcomes, which are determined by the genetic diversity of the infecting 
      strains. Comparative genetic analysis of infecting E. histolytica strains 
      associated with differential disease outcomes from different geographical regions 
      of the world is important to identify the specific genetic patterns of the 
      pathogen that trigger certain disease outcomes of Amoebiasis. The strategy is 
      able to elucidate the genealogical relation and population structure of infecting 
      E. histolytica strains from different geographical regions. In the present study, 
      we have performed a comparative genetic analysis of circulating E. histolytica 
      strains identified from different parts of the world, including our study region, 
      based on five tRNA-linked short tandem repeat (STR) loci (i.e., D-A, NK2, R-R, 
      S(TGA)-D and A-L) and evaluated their potential associations with differential 
      disease outcomes of Amoebiasis. A number of regional-specific, emerging 
      haplotypes of E. histolytica, significantly associated with specific disease 
      outcomes have been identified. Haplotypes, which have a significant positive 
      association with asymptomatic and amoebic liver abscess outcomes, showed a 
      significant negative association with diarrheal outcome, or vice versa. 
      Comparative multi-locus analysis revealed that E. histolytica isolates from our 
      study region are phylogenetically segregated from the isolates of other 
      geographical regions. This study provides a crucial overview of the population 
      structure and emerging pattern of the enteric parasite, E. histolytica.

AB  - Amoebiasis, caused by the enteric parasite Entamoeba histolytica has differential 
      disease outcomes. The association of parasite genotypes with outcomes of amoebic 
      infection is still a paradox and requires to be explored. The genetic information 
      of infecting strains from endemic settings of different geographical regions is 
      essential to evaluate the relation. Comparative genetics of E. histolytica 
      clinical isolates from different disease outcomes have been explored based on two 
      tRNA-linked STR loci (S(TGA)-D and A-L). All of the repeat patterns in the A-L 
      locus were newly identified and unique to Indian isolates. The majority of newly 
      identified repeat patterns in S(TGA)-D locus have outcome-specific distributions, 
      predicting the emergence of disease-specific mutations in this target locus. 
      Statistical analysis further reinforces this observation, as identified repeat 
      patterns only from S(TGA)-D but not A-L locus were significantly associated with 
      disease outcomes. Phylogenetic analysis indicates independent segregation and 
      divergence of tRNA-linked STR arrays for each STR locus.

AB  - Gene expression, often determined by single nucleotide polymorphisms, short 
      repeated sequences known as short tandem repeats (STRs), structural variants, and 
      environmental factors, provides means for an organism to produce gene products 
      necessary to live. Variation in expression levels, sometimes known as enrichment 
      patterns, has been associated with disease progression. Thus, the STR enrichment 
      patterns have recently gained interest as potential genetic markers for disease 
      progression. However, to the best of our knowledge, we are unaware of any study 
      that evaluates and explores STRs, particularly trinucleotide sequences, as 
      machine learning features for classifying neurological disease genes for the 
      purpose of discovering genetic features. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a new 
      metric and a novel feature extraction and selection algorithm based on 
      statistically significant STR-based features and their respective enrichment 
      patterns to create a statistically significant feature set. The proposed new 
      metric has shown that the neurological disease family genes have a non-random AA, 
      AT, TA, TG, and TT enrichment pattern. This is an important result, as it 
      supports prior research that has established that certain trinucleotides, such as 
      AAT, ATA, ATT, TAT, and TTA, are favored during protein misfolding. In contrast, 
      trinucleotides, such as TAA, TAG, and TGA, are favored during premature 
      termination codon mutations as they are stop codons. This suggests that the 
      metric has the potential to identify patterns that may be genetic features in a 
      sample of neurological genes. Moreover, the practical performance and high 
      prediction results of the statistically significant STR-based feature set 
      indicate that variations in STR enrichment patterns can distinguish neurological 
      disease genes. In conclusion, the proposed approach may have the potential to 
      discover differential genetic features for other diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leucine-rich repeat sequence domains are known to mediate 
      protein...protein interactions. Recently, some studies showed that members of the 
      leucine rich repeat containing (LRRC) protein superfamily may become new targets 
      for the diagnosis and treatment of tumours. However, it is not known whether any 
      of the LRRC superfamily genes is expressed in the stroma of ovarian cancer (OC) 
      and is associated with prognosis. METHODS: The clinical data and transcriptional 
      profiles of OC patients from the public databases TCGA (n = 427), GTEx (n = 88) 
      and GEO (GSE40266 and GSE40595) were analysed by R software. A nomogram model was 
      also generated through R. An online public database was used for auxiliary 
      analysis of prognosis, immune infiltration and protein...protein interaction (PPI) 
      networks. Immunohistochemistry and qPCR were performed to determine the protein 
      and mRNA levels of genes in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) tissues of 
      participants and the MRC-5 cell line induced by TGF-beta. RESULTS: LRRC15 and LRRC32 
      were identified as differentially expressed genes from the LRRC superfamily by 
      GEO transcriptome analysis. PPI network analysis suggested that they were most 
      enriched in TGF-beta signalling. The TCGA-GTEx analysis results showed that only 
      LRRC15 was highly expressed in both cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and the 
      tumour stroma of OC and was related to clinical prognosis. Based on this, we 
      developed a nomogram model to predict the incidence of adverse outcomes in OC. 
      Moreover, LRRC15 was positively correlated with CAF infiltration and negatively 
      correlated with CD8 + T-cell infiltration. As a single indicator, LRRC15 had the 
      highest accuracy (AUC = 0.920) in predicting the outcome of primary platinum 
      resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The LRRC superfamily is related to the TGF-beta pathway in 
      the microenvironment of OC. LRRC15, as a stromal biomarker, can predict the 
      clinical prognosis of HGSC and promote the immunosuppressive microenvironment. 
      LRRC15 may be a potential therapeutic target for reversing primary resistance in 
      OC.

      Indian non...habitual tongue carcinoma patients.

AB  - Oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) is one of the major causes of 
      fatality in India due to very high percentage of patients with habits of smoking 
      and chewing tobacco and associated products. Being highly heterogeneous in 
      nature, every patient poses a different challenge clinically. To understand 
      disease progression in an improved way, knowledge of cross...talk between tumor 
      stroma and the tumor cells becomes indispensable. Patient...derived in vitro cell 
      line models are helpful to understand the complexity of diseases. However, they 
      have very low efficiency of establishment from the tumor samples, particularly 
      the cancer...associated fibroblasts (CAFs). In the present study, two novel 
      autologous pairs were immortalized spontaneously from non...habitual, HPV...positive 
      patients, who presented with OTSCC. The epithelial and fibroblast cell lines had 
      typical polygonal and spindle...shaped morphology, respectively. Positive staining 
      with epithelial specific Pan...cytokeratin (PanCK) and fibroblast specific protein 
      (FSP...1) further confirmed their epithelial and fibroblast origin. Unique Short 
      Tandem Repeat (STR) profile of the cultures confirmed their novelty, while the 
      similarity of the STR profiles between the epithelial and fibroblast cells from 
      the same patient, confirmed their autologous nature. DNA analysis revealed 
      aneuploidy of the established cultures. An increase in the tumorigenic potential 
      of the established epithelial cultures upon treatment with CAF...conditioned medium 
      proved the 'CAF...ness' of the established fibroblast cells. The established 
      cultures are the first of their kind which would serve as a useful platform in 
      understanding the tumor...stroma cross...talk in tongue cancer progression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemo-resistance is still a major obstacle in leukemia treatment. 
      Accumulating evidence indicates that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the 
      most abundant stromal cells in tumor microenvironment (TME), play a crucial role 
      in cancer progression and response to chemotherapy. To Figure out the role of 
      leukemia-associated fibroblasts (LAFs) in relapsed/refractory leukemia, we 
      constructed the first leukemia-associated fibroblastic tumor cell line, HXWMF-1. 
      METHODS: A cell culture technique was used to establish the leukemia-associated 
      fibroblastic tumor cell line. Molecular and cellular biological techniques 
      including flow cytometry, MTT assay, western blotting, and short tandem repeat 
      (STR) analysis were used to characterize the cell line. Nude mice were used for 
      xenograft studies. RESULTS: We established a LAFs derived tumor cell line 
      HXWMF-1, originated from the subcutaneous xenografts of HXEX-ALL1, a cell line 
      originated from a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at the second 
      relapse. The HXWMF-1 cell line was authenticated as a tumor cell line and being 
      derived from CAFs based on morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and STR 
      analyses and tumorigenicity test in nude mice. To clarify the reliability of the 
      method, we got the LAFs derived tumor cells from three different tumor mass of 
      HXEX-ALL1 xenografts. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, HXWMF-1 is the first 
      fibroblastic tumor cell line derived from LAFs or CAFs. In addition, the cell 
      line provided firm evidence for that leukemia cells may induce LAFs/CAFs 
      malignant transformation, which may help to develop brand new theory and 
      therapeutic strategies for patients with relapsed /refractory ALL.

      DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome.
PG  - 40031

LID - 40031
AB  - DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome (DGS/VCFS) is a disorder caused by a 22q11.2 
      deletion mediated by non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between low-copy 
      repeats (LCRs). We have evaluated the role of LCR22 genomic architecture and 
      PRDM9 variants as DGS/VCFS predisposing factors. We applied FISH using fosmid 
      probes on chromatin fibers to analyze the number of tandem repeat blocks in LCR22 
      in two DGS/VCFS fathers-of-origin with proven 22q11.2 NAHR susceptibility. 
      Results revealed copy number variations (CNVs) of L9 and K3 fosmids in these 
      individuals compared to controls. The total number of L9 and K3 copies was also 
      characterized using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Although we were unable to 
      confirm variations, we detected an additional L9 amplicon corresponding to a 
      pseudogene. Moreover, none of the eight DGS/VCFS parents-of-origin was 
      heterozygote for the inv(22)(q11.2) haplotype. PRDM9 sequencing showed equivalent 
      allelic distributions between DGS/VCFS parents-of-origin and controls, although a 
      new PRDM9 allele (L50) was identified in one case. Our results support the 
      hypothesis that LCR22s variations influences 22q11.2 NAHR events, however further 
      studies are needed to confirm this association and clarify the contribution of 
      pseudogenes and rare PDRM9 alleles to NAHR susceptibility.

      astrocytoma of the spinal cord.

AB  - We report on a 9-years-old patient with mild intellectual disability, facial 
      dimorphisms, bilateral semicircular canal dysplasia, periventricular nodular 
      heterotopias, bilateral hippocampal malrotation and abnormal cerebellar 
      foliation, who developed mild motor impairment and gait disorder due to a 
      pilocytic astrocytoma of the spinal cord. Array-CGH analysis revealed two 
      paternal inherited chromosomal events: a 484.3 Kb duplication on chromosome 
      15q26.3 and a 247 Kb deletion on 22q11.23. Further, a second de novo 1.5 Mb 
      deletion on 22q11.21 occurred. Chromosome 22 at q11.2 and chromosome 15 at q24q26 
      are considered unstable regions subjected to copy number variations, i.e. 
      structural alterations of genome, mediated by low copy repeat sequences or 
      segmental duplications. The link between some structural CNVs, which compromise 
      fundamental processes controlling DNA stability, and genomic disorders suggest a 
      plausible scenario for cancer predisposition. Evaluation of the genes at the 
      breakpoints cannot account simultaneously for the phenotype and tumour 
      development in this patient. The two paternal inherited CNVs arguably are not 
      pathogenic and do not contribute to the clinical manifestations. Similarly, 
      although the de novo large deletion at 22q11.21 overlaps with the Di George (DGS) 
      critical region and results in haploinsufficiency of genes compromising critical 
      processes for DNA stability, this case lacks several hallmarks of DGS.

TI  - Mammalian TBX1 preferentially binds and regulates downstream targets via a tandem 
      T-site repeat.
PG  - e95151
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0095151 [doi]
LID - e95151
AB  - Haploinsufficiency or mutation of TBX1 is largely responsible for the etiology of 
      physical malformations in individuals with velo-cardio-facial/DiGeorge syndrome 
      (VCFS/DGS/22q11.2 deletion syndrome). TBX1 encodes a transcription factor protein 
      that contains an evolutionarily conserved DNA binding domain termed the T-box 
      that is shared with other family members. All T-box proteins, examined so far, 
      bind to similar but not identical consensus DNA sequences, indicating that they 
      have specific binding preferences. To identify the TBX1 specific consensus 
      sequence, Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) was 
      performed. In contrast to other TBX family members recognizing palindrome 
      sequences, we found that TBX1 preferentially binds to a tandem repeat of 
      5'-AGGTGTGAAGGTGTGA-3'. We also identified a second consensus sequence comprised 
      of a tandem repeat with a degenerated downstream site. We show that three known 
      human disease-causing TBX1 missense mutations (F148Y, H194Q and G310S) do not 
      alter nuclear localization, or disrupt binding to the tandem repeat consensus 
      sequences, but they reduce transcriptional activity in cell culture reporter 
      assays. To identify Tbx1-downstream genes, we performed an in silico genome wide 
      analysis of potential cis-acting elements in DNA and found strong enrichment of 
      genes required for developmental processes and transcriptional regulation. We 
      found that TBX1 binds to 19 different loci in vitro, which may correspond to 
      putative cis-acting binding sites. In situ hybridization coupled with luciferase 
      gene reporter assays on three gene loci, Fgf8, Bmper, Otog-MyoD, show that these 
      motifs are directly regulated by TBX1 in vitro. Collectively, the present studies 
      establish new insights into molecular aspects of TBX1 binding to DNA. This work 
      lays the groundwork for future in vivo studies, including chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to further 
      elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of VCFS/DGS.

AB  - Genotypes of Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica) may contribute clinical 
      phenotypes of amoebiasis such as amoebic liver abscess (ALA), dysentery and 
      asymptomatic cyst passers state. Hence, we evaluated allelic variation due to 
      short tandem repeats (STRs) in tRNA gene of E. histolytica and clinical 
      phenotypes of amoebiasis. Asymptomatic cyst passers (n=24), patients with 
      dysentery (n=56) and ALA (n=107) were included. Extracted DNA from stool 
      (dysentery, asymptomatic cyst passers) and liver aspirate was amplified using 6 
      E. histolytica specific tRNA-linked STRs (D-A, A-L, N-K2, R-R, S-Q, and S(TGA)-D) 
      primers. PCR products were subjected to sequencing. Association between allelic 
      variation and clinical phenotypes was analyzed. A total of 9 allelic variations 
      were found in D-A, 8 in A-L, 4 in N-K2, 5 in R-R, 10 in S(TAG)-D and 7 in S-Q 
      loci. A significant association was found between allelic variants and clinical 
      phenotypes of amoebiasis. This study reveals that allelic variation due to short 
      tandem repeats (STRs) in tRNA gene of E. histolytica is associated different 
      clinical outcome of amoebiasis.

AB  - A few PCR-based DNA typing methods using repetitive elements contained within 
      both protein-coding genes and noncoding DNAs have been reported for Entamoeba 
      histolytica over the years. The serine-rich E. histolytica protein and 
      tRNA-linked short tandem repeats (STRs) are most commonly used to investigate the 
      relationship between parasite genotype and E. histolytica infection outcome. Many 
      E. histolytica infections in China have been reported; however, little genome 
      information has been provided. In the current paper, five Chinese E. histolytica 
      samples were reported: three amoebic liver abscess cases, one combined case and 
      one asymptomatic case. Our study is the first to report on the DNA typing 
      information of E. histolytica in China. We included two city, one imported, and 
      two country cases. Sequence analysis of serine-rich protein genes confirmed the 
      presence of seven sequence types in five isolates. The STRs amplified from the 
      samples revealed five STR variations in the A-L, four in the N-K2, and R-R loci, 
      three in D-A, S(TGA)-D and S-Q loci. Two country patients were found to have a 
      different outcome of infection with the same genotypes of E. histolytica, whereas 
      in a city case, one E. histolytica strain had led to different outcome of the 
      infection in one patient. Analyses of the results suggest that more genome 
      information of E. histolytica strains from China through accurate methods is 
      needed to interpret how the parasite genome plays a role in determining the 
      outcome of E. histolytica infections.

TI  - Endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene polymorphisms associated with 
      susceptibility to high altitude pulmonary edema in Chinese railway construction 
      workers at Qinghai-Tibet over 4 500 meters above sea level.
PG  - 215-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the polymorphisms of endothelial nitric oxide 
      synthase (eNOS) gene are associated with the susceptibility to high altitude 
      pulmonary edema (HAPE) in Chinese railway construction workers at Qinghai-Tibet 
      where the altitude is over 4 500 m above sea level. METHODS: A case-control study 
      was conducted including 149 HAPE patients in the construction workers and 160 
      healthy controls randomly recruited from their co-workers, matching the patients 
      in ethnicity, age, sex, lifestyle, and working conditions. Three polymorphisms of 
      eNOS gene, T-786C in promoter, 894G/T in exon 7, and 27bp variable number tandem 
      repeat (VNTR) in intron 4, were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      and confirmed with DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The frequencies of 894T allele and 
      heterozygous G/T of the 894G/T variant were significantly higher in HAPE patients 
      group than in the control group (P=0.0028 and P=0.0047, respectively). However, 
      the frequencies of the T-786C in promoter and the 27bp VNTR in intron 4 were not 
      significantly different between the two groups. Haplotypic analysis revealed that 
      the frequencies of two haplotypes (H3,T-T-b, b indicates 5 repeats of 27 bp VNTR; 
      H6, C-G-a, a indicates 4 repeats of 27 bp VNTR) were significantly higher in HAPE 
      patients (both Pu0.0001). On the contrary, the frequencies of H1 (T-G-b) and H2 
      (T-G-a) were lower in HAPE patients than in healthy controls (both Pu0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Two haplotypes (T-T-b and C-G-a) may be strongly associated with 
      susceptibility to HAPE. Compared with the individual alleles of eNOS gene, the 
      interaction of multiple genetic markers within a haplotype may be a major 
      determinant for the susceptibility to HAPE.

TI  - Gene dosage analysis identifies large deletions of the FECH gene in 10% of 
      families with erythropoietic protoporphyria.
PG  - 2790-4
AB  - Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is an inherited cutaneous porphyria 
      characterized by partial deficiency of ferrochelatase (FECH), accumulation of 
      protoporphyrin IX in erythrocytes, skin, and liver, and acute photosensitivity. 
      Genetic counseling in EPP requires identification of FECH mutations, but current 
      sequencing-based procedures fail to detect mutations in about one in six 
      families. We have used gene dosage analysis by quantitative PCR to identify large 
      deletions of the FECH gene in 19 (58%) of 33 unrelated UK patients with EPP in 
      whom mutations could not be detected by sequencing. Seven deletions were 
      identified, six of which were previously unreported. Breakpoints were identified 
      for six deletions (c.1-7887-IVS1+2425insTTCA; c.1-9629-IVS1+2437; 
      IVS2-1987-IVS4+352del; c.768-IVS7+244del; IVS7+2784-IVS9+108del; 
      IVS6+2350-TGA+95del). Five breakpoints were in intronic repeat sequences (AluSc, 
      AluSq, AluSx, L1MC4). The remaining deletion (Del Ex3-4) is likely to be a large 
      insertion-deletion. Combining quantitative PCR with routine sequencing increased 
      the sensitivity of mutation detection in 189 unrelated UK patients with EPP from 
      83% (95% CI: 76-87%) to 93% (CI: 88-96%) (P=0.003). Our findings show that large 
      deletions of the FECH gene are an important cause of EPP. Gene dosage analysis 
      should be incorporated into routine procedures for mutation detection in EPP.

TI  - Low copy repeats mediate distal chromosome 22q11.2 deletions: sequence analysis 
      predicts breakpoint mechanisms.
PG  - 482-91
AB  - Genomic disorders contribute significantly to genetic disease and, as detection 
      methods improve, greater numbers are being defined. Paralogous low copy repeats 
      (LCRs) mediate many of the chromosomal rearrangements that underlie these 
      disorders, predisposing chromosomes to recombination errors. Deletions of 
      proximal 22q11.2 comprise the most frequently occurring microdeletion syndrome, 
      DiGeorge/Velocardiofacial syndrome (DGS/VCFS), in which most breakpoints have 
      been localized to a 3 Mb region containing four large LCRs. Immediately distal to 
      this region, there are another four related but smaller LCRs that have not been 
      characterized extensively. We used paralog-specific primers and long-range PCR to 
      clone, sequence, and examine the distal deletion breakpoints from two patients 
      with de novo deletions mapping to these distal LCRs. Our results present 
      definitive evidence of the direct involvement of LCRs in 22q11 deletions and map 
      both breakpoints to the BCRL module, common to most 22q11 LCRs, suggesting a 
      potential region for LCR-mediated rearrangement both in the distal LCRs and in 
      the DGS interval. These are the first reported cases of distal 22q11 deletions in 
      which breakpoints have been characterized at the nucleotide level within LCRs, 
      confirming that distal 22q11 LCRs can and do mediate rearrangements leading to 
      genomic disorders.

TI  - Cardiac Registry screening for DiGeorge Critical Region deletion using loss of 
      heterozygosity analysis.
PG  - 266-79
AB  - DiGeorge (DGS), velocardiofacial, and conotruncal anomaly face syndromes comprise 
      a phenotypic spectrum that is associated with a submicroscopic 22q11.2 deletion 
      in the majority of cases. These syndromes variably express complex congenital 
      heart disease, cellular immune deficits, hypocalcemia, craniofacial anomalies, 
      and learning disabilities. This retrospective study correlates the presence of a 
      deletion in this region with autopsy and clinical findings in a cohort of 
      patients selected from the Cardiac Registry at Boston Children's Hospital. DNA 
      was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cardiac tissue sampled from 
      189 patients with conotruncal anomalies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was 
      performed using 4 fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide primer pairs for unique 
      short tandem repeat polymorphisms in the DGS critical region. The PCR products 
      were analyzed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and a deletion was assumed when 
      at least 3 consecutive loci demonstrated homozygosity. Of the 189 cases, 16 (8%) 
      met our criteria for LOH and were assumed to have a deletion. These patients 
      included 6 (35%) of 17 patients diagnosed clinically with DGS prior to death. Of 
      the 10 non-DGS patients with LOH, 4 had aortic atresia and 3 had tetralogy of 
      Fallot, both frequently seen in DGS. Polymerase chain reaction is a useful 
      screening alternative to fluorescence in situ hydridization for detecting 22q11.2 
      deletions in archived tissue samples. This study identified a probable deletion 
      in a subset of cases from a cardiac registry with cardiac defects associated with 
      the DGS phenotype.

TI  - 22q11.2 deletion mosaicism in patients with conotruncal heart defects.
PG  - 262-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some patients with conotruncal heart defects (CTDs) have a chromosome 
      22q11.2 deletion, but we do not know whether patients with CTDs who are missing 
      the peripheral blood-cell chromosome 22q11.2 deletion are also missing the 
      22q11.2 deletion in myocardial cells, and whether patients with the 22q11.2 
      deletion can show a different 22q11.2 deletion in peripheral blood cells and 
      myocardial cells due to a postzygotic mutation during the embryonic period. 
      METHODS: A total of 32 Chinese pediatric nonsyndromic CTD patients (21 with 
      tetralogy of fallot [TOF], 9 with double outlet right ventricle [DORV], 1 with 
      pulmonary artery atresia with ventricular septal defect [PAA/VSD], and 1 with 
      congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries [CCTGA]), 12 females 
      and 20 males ranging in age from 5 months to 7 years, were included in our study. 
      We used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to find the chromosome 22q11.2 
      deletion in peripheral blood cells and compared genotypes of 15 short tandem 
      repeat (STR) markers within 22q11.2 between peripheral blood cells and myocardial 
      cells to search for genetic mosaicism of the chromosome 22q11.2 deletion. 
      RESULTS: Three patients, 2 with TOF and 1 with DORV, were determined to have the 
      peripheral blood cell chromosome 22q11.2 deletion. There was no STR genotypic 
      difference observed between peripheral blood cells and myocardial cells in 
      patients with or without the chromosome 22q11.2 deletion. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic 
      mosaicism may not play a major role in the etiology of isolated CTDs.

TI  - Timed mutation and cell-fate mapping reveal reiterated roles of Tbx1 during 
      embryogenesis, and a crucial function during segmentation of the pharyngeal 
      system via regulation of endoderm expansion.
PG  - 4387-95
AB  - The definition of time-specific requirements for a developmental gene can 
      pinpoint the processes within which the gene is involved and can reveal potential 
      late functions in structures and organs that fail to develop in germline mutants. 
      Here, we show the first systematic time-course deletion, in parallel with timed 
      cell fate mapping, of a developmentally crucial gene, Tbx1, during mouse 
      embryogenesis. Tbx1 mouse mutants model DiGeorge syndrome, a disorder of 
      pharyngeal and cardiovascular development. Results revealed different time 
      requirements for the development of individual structures, as well as multiple 
      and time-distinct roles during the development of the same organ or system. We 
      also show that Tbx1 is required throughout pharyngeal segmentation for the 
      regulation of endoderm expansion, thus this is the first gene implicated directly 
      in this process. A genetic-based blueprint of crucial developmental times for 
      organs and systems should be a valuable asset for our understanding of birth 
      defect pathogenesis.

TI  - Association study between CAG trinucleotide repeats in the PCQAP gene (PC2 
      glutamine/Q-rich-associated protein) and schizophrenia.
PG  - 32-5
AB  - Schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders are quite common features in patients 
      with DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome (DGS/VCFS) as a result of hemizygosity of 
      chromosome 22q11.2. We evaluated the PCQAP gene, which maps within the DGS/VCFS 
      interval, as a potential candidate for schizophrenia susceptibility. PCQAP 
      encodes for a subunit of the large multiprotein complex PC2, which exhibits a 
      coactivator function in RNA polymerase II mediated transcription. Using a 
      case-control study, we searched association between schizophrenia and the 
      intragenic coding trinucleotide polymorphism. The distribution of the CAG repeat 
      alleles was significantly different between patients and controls with the 
      Mann-Whitney test (z = -2.5694, P = 0.0051; schizophrenics: n = 378, W = 
      161,002.5, Mean rank = 425.9325; controls: n = 444, W = 177,250.5, Mean rank = 
      399.2128). This result may indicate a possible involvement of the multiprotein 
      complex PC2 in schizophrenia susceptibility.

TI  - Molecular analysis of syndromic congenital heart disease using short tandem 
      repeat markers and semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction method.
PG  - 264-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Velo-cardiofacial syndrome (VCFS) and DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) are 
      developmental disorders characterized by craniofacial anomalies and conotruncal 
      heart defects. Many of them have hemizygous deletions within chromosome 22q11.2, 
      suggesting that haploinsufficiency in this region are responsible for their 
      etiologies. METHODS: To effectively understand the molecular basis for the 
      chromosomal deletions, a semiquantitative fluores-cent polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) method using 11 highly polymorphic markers located in 22q11.2 to perform 
      genotyping analysis on 10 probands (five VCFS and five DGS) and their unaffected 
      relatives were designed. RESULTS: Two VCFS and four DGS patients have a 3-Mb 
      deletion; the other DGS patient has a 1.5-Mb deletion and a cross-over occurs in 
      the same interval at the other allele. CONCLUSION: This results supports that the 
      specific regions in 22q11.2 are susceptible to rearrangement and the deletions 
      might be the genetic etiology of these syndromes. Most important of all, the new 
      method, semiquantitative fluorescent PCR, is an effective method for detecting 
      chromosomal microdeletions and has the following features: (i) the cost is 
      inexpensive; (ii) the testing time is short; and (iii) the result is accurate.

TI  - Association of tetralogy of Fallot with a distinct region of del22q11.2.
PG  - 294-8
AB  - Congenital heart defects (CHDs) appear in greater frequency among relatives of 
      patients and in individuals with DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) or velo-cardio-facial 
      syndrome (VCFS). A majority of these patients and part of the apparently 
      nonsyndromic CHD patients with conotruncal defects manifest hemizygous deletions 
      within chromosome 22q11.2 (del22q11). We tested myocardial tissues of 31 CHD 
      patients, 21 with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and 10 with a double-chamber right 
      ventricle (DCRV). DNA isolated from tissues removed at corrective surgery was 
      analyzed for homo- or heterozygosity of nine polymorphic short tandem repeat 
      (STR) markers along the 22q11.2 region. DNA from the blood of 45 healthy 
      individuals represented the general population. Ten of the 21 TOF patients (48%) 
      showed homozygosity for three or more consecutive markers, indicating deletions 
      of various sizes. No such indication was found for DCRV patients. Heterozygosity 
      for markers D22S1648, D22S941, and D22S944 was lower in the TOF group than in 
      normal controls, defining a minimal critical region (MCR) for the deletion. Our 
      findings support an association between TOF and hemizygosity in 22q11.2, 
      suggesting a distinct region, between markers D22S1638 and COMT, that may harbor 
      TOF susceptibility genes.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of a novel gene containing WD40 repeats from the 
      region deleted in velo-cardio-facial/DiGeorge syndrome on chromosome 22q11.
PG  - 264-71
AB  - Three congenital disorders, cat-eye syndrome (CES), der(22) syndrome, and 
      velo-cardio-facial syndrome/DiGeorge syndrome (VCFS/DGS), result from tetrasomy, 
      trisomy, and monosomy, respectively, of part of 22q11. They share a 1.5-Mb region 
      of overlap, which contains 24 known genes. Although the region has been sequenced 
      and extensively analyzed, it is expected to contain additional genes, which have 
      thus far escaped identification. To understand completely the molecular etiology 
      of VCFS/DGS, der(22) syndrome, and CES, it is essential to isolate all genes in 
      the interval. We have identified and characterized a novel human gene, located 
      within the 1.5-Mb region deleted in VCFS/DGS, trisomic in der(22) syndrome and 
      tetrasomic in CES. The deduced amino acid sequence of the human gene and its 
      mouse homologue contain several WD40 repeats, but lack homology to known 
      proteins. We termed this gene WDR14 (WD40 repeat-containing gene deleted in 
      VCFS). It is expressed in a variety of human and mouse adult and fetal tissues 
      with substantial expression levels in the adult thymus, an organ hypoplastic in 
      VCFS/DGS.

TI  - Mouse RNA helicase II/Gu: cDNA and genomic sequences, chromosomal localization,

PG  - 184-94
AB  - RNA helicase II/Gu (RH II/Gu) is a mammalian nucleolar RNA helicase previously 
      identified using an autoimmune serum from a patient with watermelon stomach 
      disease. RH II/Gu can unwind double-stranded RNA and can fold or introduce a 
      secondary structure to a single-stranded RNA. These two enzymatic activities 
      reside in two separate domains of the RH II/Gu molecule. The present study 
      reports the molecular analysis of the cDNA and genomic sequences of the mouse RH 
      II/Gu, its chromosomal localization, and the regulation of expression. The 
      cDNA-derived amino acid sequence shows three tandem repeats at the NH(2)-terminal 
      end of the protein, which are not conserved in the human homologue. Each repeat 
      has 37 amino acids that are rich in basic residues. The helicase and foldase 
      domains are highly conserved between the mouse and the human RH II/Gu. The basic 
      promoter region of the mouse RH II/Gu gene is within 300 nucleotides upstream of 
      a putative ATG initiation codon. Upstream of this promoter region is a silencer 
      that represses transcription of the mouse RH II/Gu gene. This inhibitory region 
      contains three 38-nucleotide repeats in tandem. The mouse RH II/Gu consists of 14 
      exons and 13 introns. The 3' flanking sequence of the gene contains three 
      putative polyadenylation sites but only two sites are probably functional as 
      shown by Northern blot analysis and 3' end sequences of mouse RH II/Gu cDNA in 
      the EST database. These two alternative polyadenylation sites are approximately 
      240 and 2100 nucleotides from the TGA stop codon. Both mouse and human RH II/Gu 
      genes are localized on chromosome 10. The availability of the mouse RH II/Gu gene 
      will facilitate its functional analysis including creation of a mouse deficient 
      in RH II/Gu protein.

TI  - Chromosome 22-specific low copy repeats and the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: 
      genomic organization and deletion endpoint analysis.
PG  - 489-501
AB  - The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which includes DiGeorge and velocardiofacial 
      syndromes (DGS/VCFS), is the most common microdeletion syndrome. The majority of 
      deleted patients share a common 3 Mb hemizygous deletion of 22q11.2. The 
      remaining patients include those who have smaller deletions that are nested 
      within the 3 Mb typically deleted region (TDR) and a few with rare deletions that 
      have no overlap with the TDR. The identification of chromosome 22-specific 
      duplicated sequences or low copy repeats (LCRs) near the end-points of the 3 Mb 
      TDR has led to the hypothesis that they mediate deletions of 22q11.2. The entire 
      3 Mb TDR has been sequenced, permitting detailed investigation of the LCRs and 
      their involvement in the 22q11.2 deletions. Sequence analysis has identified four 
      LCRs within the 3 Mb TDR. Although the LCRs differ in content and organization of 
      shared modules, those modules that are common between them share 97-98% sequence 
      identity with one another. By fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, 
      the end-points of four variant 22q11.2 deletions appear to localize to the LCRs. 
      Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern hybridization have been used to 
      identify rearranged junction fragments from three variant deletions. Analysis of 
      junction fragments by PCR and sequencing of the PCR products implicate the LCRs 
      directly in the formation of 22q11.2 deletions. The evolutionary origin of the 
      duplications on chromosome 22 has been assessed by FISH analysis of non-human 
      primates. Multiple signals in Old World monkeys suggest that the duplication 
      events may have occurred at least 20-25 million years ago.

TI  - Patient with a 22q11.2 deletion with no overlap of the minimal DiGeorge syndrome 
      critical region (MDGCR).
PG  - 27-33
AB  - The apparent lack of genotype/phenotype correlation in patients with the DiGeorge 
      anomaly and velocardiofacial syndrome (DGA/VCFS; the "22q11 deletion syndrome") 
      indicates a complex genetic condition. Most cases, whatever the phenotype, have a 
      1.5-3 Mb chromosomal deletion that includes the minimal DiGeorge critical region 
      (MDGCR). Another potential critical region on 22q11 has been suggested based on 
      two patients with distal deletions outside the MDGCR. We report on a patient with 
      a VCFS phenotype who has a deletion, mapped by short tandem repeat polymorphic 
      loci and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis, distal to and not 
      overlapping the MDGCR. This patient is deleted for several genes, including the 
      T-box 1 gene (TBX1; a transcription regulator expressed early in embryogenesis) 
      and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT; involved in neurotransmitter metabolism). 
      We discuss the role these two genes may play in the clinical phenotype of the 
      patient.

TI  - Incidence and significance of 22q11.2 hemizygosity in patients with interrupted 
      aortic arch.
PG  - 322-31
AB  - Interruption of the aortic arch (IAA) is a severe malformation of the heart with 
      known association to DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) and 22q11.2 hemizygosity. The aim of 
      this study was to establish incidence and significance of 22q11.2 hemizygosity in 
      an unbiased sample of patients with IAA. All 15 children with IAA who were 
      referred to our hospital in a 3-year period were tested by chromosome and 
      fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with the probes D22S75, 
      Tuplel, and cHKAD26 and by a set of 10 simple tandem repeat polymorphic (STRP) 
      markers. In nine of 11 children with IAA type B, 22q11.2 hemizygosity was 
      demonstrated by FISH and STRP analysis, but in none of the four children with 
      type A. In all but one child, deletion size was approximately 3 Mb. The girl with 
      the smaller deletion of approximately 1.5 Mb differed because of an 
      Ullrich-Turner syndrome-like phenotype and severe T-cell defect. Additionally, in 
      one patient with phenotypic signs of DGS, a small deletion distal to the known 
      DGS region containing the marker D22S308 was suspected by STRP analysis. One 
      deletion was shown to be inherited from a healthy father and one IAA type A 
      recurred in a sib. T-cell anomalies were evident in eight of the nine children 
      with classical deletion, five of whom suffered also from hypoparathyroidism. With 
      respect to cause and clinical course, IAA type A and B were shown to represent 
      different entities. This study showed that variable symptoms of 22q11.2 
      hemizygosity may cluster.

TI  - Unstable insertion in the 5' flanking region of the cystatin B gene is the most 
      common mutation in progressive myoclonus epilepsy type 1, EPM1.
PG  - 298-302
AB  - Progressive myoclonus epilepsy type 1 (EPM1, also known as Unverricht-Lundborg 
      disease) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressively 
      worsening myoclonic jerks, frequent generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and a 
      slowly progressive decline in cognition. Recently, two mutations in the cystatin 
      B gene (also known as stefin B, STFB) mapping to 21q22.3 have been implicated in 
      the EPM1 phenotype: a G-->C substitution in the last nucleotide of intron 1 that 
      was predicted to cause a splicing defect in one family, and a C-->T substitution 
      that would change an Arg codon (CGA) to a stop codon (TGA) at amino acid position 
      68, resulting in a truncated cystatin B protein in two other families. A fourth 
      family showed undetectable amounts of STFB mRNA by northern blot analysis in an 
      affected individual. We present haplotype and mutational analyses of our 
      collection of 20 unrelated EPM1 patients and families from different ethnic 
      groups. We identify four different mutations, the most common of which consists 
      of an unstable approximately 600-900 bp insertion which is resistant to PCR 
      amplification. This insertion maps to a 12-bp polymorphic tandem repeat located 
      in the 5' flanking region of the STFB gene, in the region of the promoter. The 
      size of the insertion varies between different EPM1 chromosomes sharing a common 
      haplotype and a common origin, suggesting some level of meiotic instability over 
      the course of many generations. This dynamic mutation, which appears distinct 
      from conventional trinucleotide repeat expansions, may arise via a novel 
      mechanism related to the instability of tandemly repeated sequences.

TI  - The bovine interleukin-4 gene: genomic organization, localization, and evolution.
PG  - 350-6
AB  - Interleukin-4 (IL4) is involved in the immune response to certain parasites and 
      possibly in the development of some atopic diseases since it triggers the T 
      helper 2 lymphocyte response. Therefore, IL4 is a candidate gene, for example, 
      for disease association studies and gene mapping. We isolated bovine IL4 cosmids 
      and determined the genomic organization. Fragments carrying the exons as well as 
      725 base pairs (bp) from the 5' flanking and 190 bp from the 3' flanking region 
      were cloned and sequenced. The first 481 base pairs of the 5' flanking region, 
      including the putative promoter sequences, are surprisingly similar (92%) between 
      cattle and human. In addition, we cloned and sequenced a mixed [(t/g)a]m(ca)n 
      repeat located approximately 35 kilobases upstream from the IL4 gene. It showed 
      seven repeat length alleles in a limited number of animals. The IL4 gene has been 
      assigned to 7q15-q21 by fluorescence in situ hybridization in cattle. 
      Evolutionary aspects are discussed on the basis of sequence data as well as 
      interspecies chromosomal homologies.

      disease were collated in order to study underlying causative mechanisms. Deletion 
      breakpoint junction regions were found to be non-random both at the nucleotide 
      and dinucleotide sequence levels, an observation consistent with an endogenous 
      sequence-directed mechanism of mutagenesis. Direct repeats of between 2bp and 8bp 
      were found in the immediate vicinity of all but one of the 60 deletions analysed. 
      Direct repeats are a feature of a number of recombination, replication or 
      repair-based models of deletion mutagenesis and the possible contribution of each 
      to the spectrum of mutations examined was assessed. The influence of parameters 
      such as repeat length and length of DNA between repeats was studied in relation 
      to the frequency, location and extent of these deletions. Findings were broadly 
      consistent with a slipped mispairing model but the predicted deletion of one 
      whole repeat copy was found only rarely. A modified version of the slipped 
      mispairing hypothesis was therefore proposed and was shown to possess 
      considerable explanatory value for approximately 25% of deletions examined. 
      Whereas the frequency of inverted repeats in the vicinity of gene deletions was 
      not significantly elevated, these elements may nevertheless promote instability 
      by facilitating the formation of secondary structure intermediates. A significant 
      excess of symmetrical sequence elements was however found at sites of single base 
      deletions. A new model to explain the involvement of symmetric elements in 
      frameshift mutagenesis was devised, which successfully accounted for a majority 
      of the single base deletions examined. In general, the loss of one or a few base 
      pairs of DNA was found to be more compatible with a replication-based model of 
      mutagenesis than with a recombination or repair hypothesis. Seven hitherto 
      unrecognized hotspots for deletion were noted in five genes (AT3, F8, HBA, HBB 
      and HPRT). Considerable sequence homology was found between these different 
      sites, and a consensus sequence (TGA/GA/GG/TA/C) was drawn up. Sequences fitting 
      this consensus (i) were noted in the immediate vicinity of 41% of the other 
      (sporadic) gene deletions, (ii) were found frequently at sites of spontaneous 
      deletion in the hamster APRT gene, (iii) were found to be associated with many 
      larger human gene deletions/translocations, (iv) act as arrest sites for human 
      polymerase alpha during DNA replication and (v) have been shown by in vitro 
      studies of human polymerase alpha to be especially prone to frameshift 
      mutation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
