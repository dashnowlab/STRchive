AB  - There is an obvious clinical-pathological overlap between essential tremor and 
      some known tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansion disorders. The aim is 
      to analyse whether these short tandem repeat genes, including ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, TBP, BEAN1, NOP56, DAB1, ATN1, 
      SADM12 and FMR1, are associated with familial essential tremor patients. Genetic 
      analysis of repeat sizes in tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansions was 
      performed in a large cohort of 515 familial essential tremor probands and 300 
      controls. The demographic and clinical features among carriers of pathogenic 
      expansions, intermediate repeats and non-carriers were compared. A total of 18 
      out of 515 (18/515, 3.7%) patients were found to have repeats expansions, 
      including 12 cases (12/515, 2.5%) with intermediate repeat expansions (one ATXN1, 
      eight TBP, two FMR1, one ATN1), and six cases (6/515, 1.2%) with pathogenic 
      expansions (one ATXN1, one ATXN2, one ATXN8OS, one PPP2R2B, one FMR1, one 
      SAMD12). There were no statistically significant differences in intermediate 
      repeats compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, there were no significant 
      differences in demographics and clinical features among individuals with 
      pathogenic expansions, intermediate repeat expansions carriers and non-carriers. 
      Our study indicates that the intermediate repeat expansion in tremor-associated 
      short tandem repeat expansions does not pose an increased risk for essential 
      tremor, and rare pathogenic expansion carriers have been found in the familial 
      essential tremor cohort. The diagnosis of essential tremor based solely on 
      clinical symptoms remains a challenge in distinguishing it from known short 
      tandem repeat expansions diseases with overlapping clinical-pathological 
      features.

TI  - Origin and evolution of pentanucleotide repeat expansions at the familial 
      cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy type1 - SAMD12 locus.
LID - 10.1038/s41431-024-01586-y [doi]
AB  - Familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy type 1 (FCMTE1) is caused by 
      (TTTTA)exp(TTTCA)exp repeat expansions in SAMD12, while pure (TTTTA)exp is 
      polymorphic. Our investigation focused on the origin and evolution of pure 
      (TTTTA)exp and (TTTTA)exp(TTTCA)exp at this locus. We observed a founder effect 
      between them. The phylogenetic analysis suggested that the (TTTTA)exp(TTTCA)exp 
      might be generated from pure (TTTTA)exp through infrequent transformation events. 
      Long-read sequencing revealed somatic generation of (TTTTA)exp(TTTCA)exp from 
      pure (TTTTA)exp, likely via long segment (TTTCA) repeats insertion. Our findings 
      indicate close relationships between the non-pathogenic (TTTTA)exp and the 
      pathogenic (TTTTA)exp(TTTCA)exp, with dynamic interconversions. This sheds light 
      on the genesis of pathogenic repeat expansions from ancestral premutation 
      alleles. Our results may guide future studies in detecting novel repeat expansion 
      disorders and elucidating repeat expansion mutational processes, thereby 
      enhancing our understanding of human genomic variation.

TI  - Seizures and electrophysiological features in familial cortical myoclonic tremor 
      with epilepsy 1.
PG  - 414-423
LID - 10.1002/acn3.51961 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate and characterize epileptic seizures and 
      electrophysiological features of familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy 
      (FCMTE) type 1 patients in a large Chinese cohort. METHODS: We systematically 
      evaluated 125 FCMTEtype 1 patients carrying the pentanucleotide (TTTCA) repeat 
      expansion in the SAMD12 gene in China. RESULTS: Among the 28 probands, epileptic 
      seizures (96.4%, 27/28) were the most common reason for an initial clinic visit. 
      Ninety-seven (77.6%, 97/125) patients had experienced seizures. The seizures 
      onset age was 36.5 +/- 9.0 years, which was 6.9 years later than cortical tremors. 
      The seizures were largely rare (<1/year, 58.8%) and occasional (1-6/year, 37.1%). 
      Prolonged prodromes were reported in 57.7% (56/97). Thirty-one patients (24.8%, 
      31/125) reported photosensitivity history, and 79.5% (31/39) had a 
      photoparoxysmal response. Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) were recorded 
      in 69.1% (56/81) of patients. Thirty-three patients showed generalized IEDs and 
      72.7% (24/33) were occipitally dominant, while 23 patients presented with focal 
      IEDs with 65.2% (15/23) taking place over the occipital lobe. Overnight EEG of 
      FCMTE patients displayed paradoxical sleep-wake fluctuation, with a higher 
      average IED index of 0.82 +/- 0.88/min during wakefulness and a lower IED index of 
      0.04 +/- 0.06/min during non-rapid eye movement sleep stages I-II. INTERPRETATION: 
      FCMTE type 1 has a benign course of epilepsy and distinct clinical and 
      electrophysiological features. In addition to a positive family history and 
      cortical myoclonus tremor, the seizure prodromes, specific seizure triggers, 
      photosensitivity, distribution of IEDs, and unique fluctuations during sleep-wake 
      cycle are cues for proper genetic testing and an early diagnosis of FCMTE.

      dominant, adult-onset neurological disease caused by SAMD12 repeat expansion. In 
      BAFME1, anticipation, such as the earlier onset of tremor and/or seizures in the 
      next generation, was reported. This could be explained by intergenerational 
      repeat instability, leading to larger expansions in successive generations. We 
      report a four-generation BAFME1-affected family with anticipation. Using Nanopore 
      long-read sequencing, detailed information regarding the sizes, configurations, 
      and compositions of the expanded SAMD12 repeats across generations was obtained. 
      Unexpectedly, a grandmother-mother-daughter triad showed similar repeat 
      structures but with slight repeat expansions, despite quite variable age of onset 
      of seizures (range: 52-14 years old), implying a complex relationship between the 
      SAMD12 repeat expansion sequence and anticipation. This study suggests that 
      different factor(s) from repeat expansion could modify the anticipation in 
      BAFME1.

AB  - Familial adult myoclonic epilepsy (FAME) is an adult-onset neurological disease 
      characterized by cortical tremor, myoclonus, and seizures due to a 
      pentanucleotide repeat expansion: a combination of pathogenic TTTCA expansion 
      associated with a TTTTA repeat in introns of six different genes. Repeat-primed 
      PCR (RP-PCR) is an inexpensive test for expansions at known loci. The analysis of 
      the SAMD12 locus revealed that the repeats have different size, configuration, 
      and composition. The TTTCA repeats can be very long (>1000 repeats) but also very 
      short (14 being the shortest identified). Here, we report siblings of European 
      descent with the clinical diagnosis of FAME yet a negative RP-PCR test. Using 
      short-read genome sequencing, we identified the pentanucleotide expansion in 
      intron 4 of SAMD12, which was confirmed by CRIPSR-Cas9-mediated enrichment and 
      long-read sequencing to be of (TTTTA)(~879) (TTTCA)(3) (TTTTA)(7) (TTTCA)(7) 
      configuration. Our finding is the first to associate the SAMD12 locus in European 
      patients with FAME and currently represents the shortest identified TTTCA 
      expansion. Our results suggest that the SAMD12 locus should be tested in patients 
      with suspected FAME independent of ethnicity. Furthermore, RP-PCR may miss the 
      underlying mutation, and genome sequencing may be needed to confirm the 
      pathogenic repeat.

TI  - Insights into familial adult myoclonus epilepsy pathogenesis: How the same repeat 
      expansion in six unrelated genes may lead to cortical excitability.
PG  - S31-S38
LID - 10.1111/epi.17504 [doi]
AB  - Familial adult myoclonus epilepsy (FAME) results from the same pathogenic 
      TTTTA/TTTCA pentanucleotide repeat expansion in six distinct genes encoding 
      proteins with different subcellular localizations and very different functions, 
      which poses the issue of what causes the neurobiological disturbances that lead 
      to the clinical phenotype. Postmortem and electrophysiological studies have 
      pointed to cortical hyperexcitability as well as dysfunction and 
      neurodegeneration of both the cortex and cerebellum of FAME subjects. FAME 
      expansions, contrary to the same expansion in DAB1 causing spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 37, seem to have no or limited impact on their recipient gene expression, 
      which suggests a pathophysiological mechanism independent of the gene and its 
      function. Current hypotheses include toxicity of the RNA molecules carrying UUUCA 
      repeats, or toxicity of polypeptides encoded by the repeats, a mechanism known as 
      repeat-associated non-AUG translation. The analysis of postmortem brains of FAME1 
      expansion (in SAMD12) carriers has revealed the presence of RNA foci that could 
      be formed by the aggregation of RNA molecules with abnormal UUUCA repeats, but 
      evidence is still lacking for other FAME subtypes. Even when the expansion is 
      located in a gene ubiquitously expressed, expression of repeats remains 
      undetectable in peripheral tissues (blood, skin). Therefore, the development of 
      appropriate cellular models (induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons) or 
      the study of affected tissues in patients is required to elucidate how FAME 
      repeat expansions located in unrelated genes lead to disease.

TI  - ATTCT and ATTCC repeat expansions in the ATXN10 gene affect disease penetrance of 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 10.
PG  - 100137
LID - 10.1016/j.xhgg.2022.100137 [doi]
LID - 100137
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is an autosomal-dominant disorder caused 
      by an expanded pentanucleotide repeat in the ATXN10 gene. This repeat expansion, 
      when fully penetrant, has a size of 850-4,500 repeats. It has been shown that the 
      repeat composition can be a modifier of disease, e.g., seizures. Here, we 
      describe a Mexican kindred in which we identified both pure (ATTCT)(n) and mixed 
      (ATTCT)(n)-(ATTCC)(n) expansions in the same family. We used amplification-free 
      targeted sequencing and optical genome mapping to decipher the composition of 
      these repeat expansions. We found a considerable degree of mosaicism of the 
      repeat expansion. This mosaicism was confirmed in skin fibroblasts from 
      individuals with ATXN10 expansions with RNAScope in situ hybridization. All 
      affected family members with the mixed ATXN10 repeat expansion showed typical 
      clinical signs of spinocerebellar ataxia and epilepsy. In contrast, individuals 
      with the pure ATXN10 expansion present with Parkinson's disease or are 
      unaffected, even in individuals more than 20 years older than the average age at 
      onset for SCA10. Our findings suggest that the pure (ATTCT)(n) expansion is 
      non-pathogenic, while repeat interruptions, e.g., (ATTCC)(n), are necessary to 
      cause SCA10. This mechanism has been recently described for several other repeat 
      expansions including SCA31 (BEAN1), SCA37 (DAB1), and three loci for benign adult 
      familial myoclonic epilepsy BAFME (SAMD12, TNRC6A, RAPGEF2). Therefore, long-read 
      sequencing and optical genome mapping of the entire genomic structure of repeat 
      expansions are critical for clinical practice and genetic counseling, as 
      variations in the repeat can affect disease penetrance, symptoms, and disease 
      trajectory.

AB  - A pentanucleotide TTTCA repeat insertion into a polymorphic TTTTA repeat element 
      in SAMD12 causes benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy. Although the precise 
      determination of the entire SAMD12 repeat sequence is important for molecular 
      diagnosis and research, obtaining this sequence remains challenging when using 
      conventional genomic/genetic methods, and even short-read and long-read 
      next-generation sequencing technologies have been insufficient. Incomplete 
      information regarding expanded repeat sequences may hamper our understanding of 
      the pathogenic roles played by varying numbers of repeat units, 
      genotype-phenotype correlations, and mutational mechanisms. Here, we report a new 
      approach for the precise determination of the entire expanded repeat sequence and 
      present a workflow designed to improve the diagnostic rates in various repeat 
      expansion diseases. We examined 34 clinically diagnosed benign adult familial 
      myoclonic epilepsy patients, from 29 families using repeat-primed PCR, Southern 
      blot, and long-read sequencing with Cas9-mediated enrichment. Two cases with 
      questionable results from repeat-primed PCR and/or Southern blot were confirmed 
      as pathogenic using long-read sequencing with Cas9-mediated enrichment, resulting 
      in the identification of pathogenic SAMD12 repeat expansions in 76% of examined 
      families (22/29). Importantly, long-read sequencing with Cas9-mediated enrichment 
      was able to provide detailed information regarding the sizes, configurations, and 
      compositions of the expanded repeats. The inserted TTTCA repeat size and the 
      proportion of TTTCA sequences among the overall repeat sequences were highly 
      variable, and a novel repeat configuration was identified. A genotype-phenotype 
      correlation study suggested that the insertion of even short (TTTCA)14 repeats 
      contributed to the development of benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy. 
      However, the sizes of the overall TTTTA and TTTCA repeat units are also likely to 
      be involved in the pathology of benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy. Seven 
      unsolved SAMD12-negative cases were investigated using whole-genome long-read 
      sequencing, and infrequent, disease-associated, repeat expansions were identified 
      in two cases. The strategic workflow resolved two questionable SAMD12-positive 
      cases and two previously SAMD12-negative cases, increasing the diagnostic yield 
      from 69% (20/29 families) to 83% (24/29 families). This study indicates the 
      significant utility of long-read sequencing technologies to explore the 
      pathogenic contributions made by various repeat units in complex repeat 
      expansions and to improve the overall diagnostic rate.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Two configurations of TTTTA/TTTCA expansion in SAMD12 have been 
      identified in familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy type 1 (FCMTE1). 
      This study investigated the clinical and neurophysiological features of FCMTE1 
      and their association with TTTTA/TTTCA expansion patterns. METHODS: In total, 76 
      patients from 20 Chinese pedigrees were enrolled. Genetic (TTTTA/TTTCA 
      configuration), clinical (e.g., onset, medication, prognosis, and anticipation) 
      and neurophysiological examination (e.g., electroencephalogram and 
      magnetoencephalography) data were evaluated, and associations between these 
      parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: All patients carried the TTTTA/TTTCA expansion 
      mutation, 19 displayed the (TTTTA)exp(TTTCA)exp (type I) configuration and 1 
      displayed the (TTTTA)exp (TTTCA)exp(TTTTA)exp (type II) configuration. All 
      patients manifested as progressive tremor, but symptoms of patients carrying type 
      II expansion were more severe. The onset of tremor but not generalized tonic and 
      clonic seizures displayed clinical anticipation between generations of 7 
      pedigrees, but the pedigree carrying the type II mutation did not show 
      anticipation. Nanopore sequencing showed that the repeats expanded during 
      maternal/offspring transmission (pedigree #7) but shrank during 
      paternal/offspring transmission (pedigree #9). Magnetoencephalographic dipoles 
      were localized in the right frontal lobe near the central sulcus in 4 patients 
      carrying the type I mutation and on the left side in one patient carrying the 
      type II mutation. SIGNIFICANCE: We confirmed the causative roles played by 
      TTTTA/TTTCA repeat expansion in the SAMD12 gene in FCTME1. Both the length and 
      the configuration of the repeats contribute to the clinical and 
      neurophysiological characteristics of the disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to perform detailed clinical and genomic analysis of a 
      large multigenerational Chinese family with 21 individuals showing symptoms of 
      Familial Cortical Myoclonic Tremor with Epilepsy (FCMTE) that we have followed 
      for over 20 years. METHODS: Patients were subjected to clinical evaluation, 
      routine EEG, and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Whole exome sequencing, 
      repeat-primed PCR, long-range PCR, and PacBio sequencing were performed to 
      characterize the disease-causing mutation in this family. RESULTS: All evaluated 
      patients manifested adult-onset seizures and presented with progressive myoclonic 
      postural tremors starting after the third or fourth decade of life. Seizures 
      typically diminished markedly in frequency with implementation of antiseizure 
      medications but did not completely cease. The electroencephalogram of affected 
      individuals showed generalized or multifocal spikes and slow wave complexes. An 
      expansion of TTTTA motifs with addition of TTTCA motifs in intron 4 of SAMD12 was 
      identified to segregate with the disease phenotype in this family. Furthermore, 
      we found that the mutant allele is unstable and can undergo both contraction and 
      expansion by changes in the number of repeat motifs each time it is passed to the 
      next generation. The size of mutant allele varied from 5 to 5.5 kb with 549-603 
      copies of TTTTA and 287-343 copies of TTTCA repeat motifs in this family. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides a detailed description of clinical progression 
      of FCMTE symptoms and its management with antiseizure medications. Our method of 
      repeat analysis by PacBio sequencing of long-range PCR products does not require 
      high-quality DNA and hence can be easily applied to other families to elucidate 
      any correlation between the repeat size and phenotypic variables, such as, age of 
      onset, and severity of symptoms.

AB  - Autosomal Dominant Cortical Tremor, Myoclonus and Epilepsy is a non-progressive 
      disorder characterized by distal tremors. Autosomal Dominant Cortical Tremor, 
      Myoclonus and Epilepsy has been reported globally with different genetic 
      predispositions of autosomal dominant inheritance with a high degree of 
      penetrance. In south India, Autosomal Dominant Cortical Tremor, Myoclonus and 
      Epilepsy has been reported in a large cohort of 48 families, in which the genetic 
      defect was not identified. This report pertains to the whole-genome analysis of 
      four individuals followed by repeat-primed PCR for 102 patients from a familial 
      cohort of 325 individuals. All the patients underwent extensive clinical 
      evaluation including neuropsychological examinations. The whole-genome sequencing 
      was done for two affected and two unaffected individuals, belonging to two 
      different families. The whole-genome sequencing analysis revealed the repeat 
      expansion of TTTTA and TTTCA in intron 4 of the SAMD12 gene located on chromosome 
      8 in the patients affected with Autosomal Dominant Cortical Tremor, Myoclonus and 
      Epilepsy, whereas the unaffected family members were negative for the similar 
      expansion. Further, the repeat-primed PCR analysis of 102 patients showed the 
      expansion of the TTTCA repeats in the intron 4 of SAMD12 gene. All patients 
      registered for this study belong to a single community called "Nadar" whose 
      nativity is confined to the southern districts of India, with reported unique 
      genetic characteristics. This is the largest and most comprehensive single report 
      on clinically and genetically characterized Autosomal Dominant Cortical Tremor, 
      Myoclonus and Epilepsy patients belonging to a unique ethnic group worldwide.

TI  - DNA analysis of benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy reveals associations 
      between the pathogenic TTTCA repeat insertion in SAMD12 and the nonpathogenic 
      TTTTA repeat expansion in TNRC6A.
PG  - 419-429

AB  - Benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy (BAFME) is an autosomal dominant disease 
      characterized by adult-onset tremulous hand movement, myoclonus, and infrequent 
      epileptic seizures. Recently, intronic expansion of unstable TTTCA/TTTTA 
      pentanucleotide repeats in SAMD12, TNRC6A, or RAPGEF2 was identified as 
      pathological mutations in Japanese BAFME pedigrees. To confirm these mutations, 
      we performed a genetic analysis on 12 Japanese BAFME pedigrees. A total of 143 
      participants, including 43 familial patients, 5 suspected patients, 3 sporadic 
      nonfamilial patients, 22 unaffected familial members, and 70 unrelated controls, 
      were screened for expanded abnormal pentanucleotide repeats in SAMD12, TNRC6A, 
      RAPGEF2, YEAT2, MARCH6, and STARD7. DNA samples were analyzed using Southern 
      blotting, long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR), repeat-primed PCR, and 
      long-range PCR followed by Southern blotting. Of the 51 individuals with 
      clinically diagnosed or suspected BAFME, 49 carried a SAMD12 allele with an 
      expanded TTTCA/TTTTA pentanucleotide repeat. Genetic and clinical anticipation 
      was observed. As in previous reports, the one patient with homozygous mutant 
      alleles showed more severe symptoms than the heterozygous carriers. In addition, 
      screening for expanded pentanucleotide repeats in TNRC6A revealed that the 
      frequency of expanded TTTTA repeat alleles in the BAFME group was significantly 
      higher than in the control group. All patients who were clinically diagnosed with 
      BAFME, including those in the original family reported by Yasuda, carried 
      abnormally expanded TTTCA/TTTTA repeat alleles of SAMD12. Patients with BAFME 
      also frequently carried a TTTTA repeat expansion in TNRC6A, suggesting that there 
      may be unknown factors in the ancestry of patients with BAFME that make 
      pentanucleotide repeats unstable.

AB  - Benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy type 1 (BAFME1) in several Japanese and 
      Chinese families has recently been found to be caused by pentanucleotide repeat 
      expansions in SAMD12. We identified a Thai family with six members affected with 
      BAFME. Microsatellite studies suggested a linkage to the BAFME1 region on 
      chromosome 8q24. Subsequently, long-read whole-genome sequencing showed the 
      (TTTTA)(446)(TTTCA)(149) in intron 4 of SAMD12 in an affected member. 
      Repeat-primed PCR and long-range PCR revealed that the pentanucleotide repeat 
      expansions segregated with the disease status. Our Thai family is the first 
      non-Japanese and non-Chinese family with BAFME1. SNP array showed that the 
      aberrant repeats had the same haplotype as those previously determined in 
      Japanese and Chinese patients suggesting a common ancestry. The variant is 
      estimated to arise ~12,000 years ago.

TI  - Familial adult myoclonic epilepsy type 1 SAMD12 TTTCA repeat expansion arose 
      17,000 years ago and is present in Sri Lankan and Indian families.
PG  - 973-978
LID - 10.1038/s41431-020-0606-z [doi]
AB  - Familial adult myoclonic epilepsy 1 (FAME1), first recognised in Japanese 
      families, was recently shown to be caused by a TTTCA repeat insertion in intron 4 
      of SAMD12 on chromosome 8. We performed whole genome sequencing on two families 
      with FAME, one of Sri Lankan origin and the other of Indian origin, and 
      identified a TTTCA repeat insertion in SAMD12 in both families. Haplotype 
      analysis revealed that both families shared the same core ancestral haplotype 
      reported in Japanese and Chinese families with FAME1. Mutation dating, based on 
      the length of shared haplotypes, estimated the age of the ancestral haplotype to 
      be ~670 generations, or 17,000 years old. Our data extend the geographic range of 
      this repeat expansion to Southern Asia and potentially implicate an even broader 
      regional distribution given the age of the variant. This finding suggests 
      patients of Asian ancestry with suspected FAME should be screened for the SAMD12 
      TTTCA expansion.

AB  - Recently, expanded intronic TTTCA and TTTTA repeat in SAMD12 were identified in 
      families with familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy (FCMTE). We 
      conducted to this study to clarify the genetic etiology and to describe the 
      clinical, neurophysiologic, and imaging features in two unrelated Chinese 
      families with FCMTE. In this study, we performed the RP-PCR and long-range PCR 
      analysis to examine and verifyTTTCA and TTTTA expansions in five affected members 
      whose severities of cortical tremor, neuropsychology and MRI were also evaluated. 
      Reliable clinical information was collected from another two affected members. 
      Our results revealed that expansions of intronic TTTCA and TTTTA repeats in 
      SAMD12 were both identified in all five affected subjects. All seven affected 
      living patients had cortical tremor with a median age at onset of 16.4 years 
      (range, 10-22 years). Convulsions occurred in 5 of 7 with a median age at onset 
      of 32.4 years (range, 10-42 years). Among five patients evaluated for cortical 
      tremor severity and psychiatric comorbidity, two patients had severe cortical 
      tremor, anxiety and depression. Abnormal brain MRI findings including the 
      possible existence of demyelination, severe atrophy of the cerebral hemisphere 
      and abnormal bilateral symmetrical signals in the globus pallidus were observed 
      in three patients, respectively. These results further expanded the known 
      genotype in two Chinese families affected with FCMTE. Border clinical spectrum 
      needs to be confirmed in future studies from additional FCMTE families 
      genetically diagnosed.

AB  - Benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy (BAFME) is an autosomal dominant 
      disorder characterized by adult-onset cortical myoclonus with or without 
      seizures. Recently, it was reported to be associated with intronic TTTTA/TTTCA 
      expansions. To investigate whether these abnormal expansions are involved in our 
      new pedigree from China, whole exome sequencing (WES) and repeat-primed 
      polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR) analysis were performed to detect potential 
      mutation in pedigree members. Neither causal mutations cosegregated with the 
      disease in the family nor any novel mutation was identified through WES, while an 
      abnormal TTTCA expansion in SAMD12 was identified by RP-PCR and then proved to be 
      cosegregated in the pedigree. All the 12 alive affected individuals (M/F = 4/8; 
      average age = 46.7 years old, range from 27 to 66) showed typical characteristics 
      of BAFME. In addition, maternal clinical anticipation was observed in six 
      mother/child pairs. In conclusion, our study offered the evidence of intronic 
      pentanucleotide expansions in SAMD12 from a new Chinese BAFME pedigree, which 
      further confirmed the association between this expansion and the pathogenesis of 
      BAFME.

AB  - Familial Adult Myoclonic Epilepsy (FAME) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder 
      characterized by cortical tremor and seizures. Intronic TTTTA/TTTCA repeat 
      expansions in SAMD12 (FAME1) are the main cause of FAME in Asia. Using genome 
      sequencing and repeat-primed PCR, we identify another site of this repeat 
      expansion, in MARCH6 (FAME3) in four European families. Analysis of single DNA 
      molecules with nanopore sequencing and molecular combing show that expansions 
      range from 3.3 to 14 kb on average. However, we observe considerable variability 
      in expansion length and structure, supporting the existence of multiple expansion 
      configurations in blood cells and fibroblasts of the same individual. Moreover, 
      the largest expansions are associated with micro-rearrangements occurring near 
      the expansion in 20% of cells. This study provides further evidence that FAME is 
      caused by intronic TTTTA/TTTCA expansions in distinct genes and reveals that 
      expansions exhibit an unexpectedly high somatic instability that can ultimately 
      result in genomic rearrangements.

TI  - Intronic (TTTGA)(n) insertion in SAMD12 also causes familial cortical myoclonic 
      tremor with epilepsy.
PG  - 1571-1576

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intronic (TTTCA)(n) insertions in the SAMD12, TNRC6A, and RAPGEF2 
      genes have been identified as causes of familial cortical myoclonic tremor with 
      epilepsy. OBJECTIVE: To identify the cause of familial cortical myoclonic tremor 
      with epilepsy pedigrees without (TTTCA)(n) insertions in SAMD12, TNRC6A, and 
      RAPGEF2. METHODS: Repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction, long-range polymerase 
      chain reaction, and Sanger sequencing were performed to identify the existence of 
      a novel (TTTGA)(n) insertion. Targeted long-read sequencing was performed to 
      confirm the accurate structure of the (TTTGA)(n) insertion. RESULTS: We 
      identified a novel expanded intronic (TTTGA)(n) insertion at the same site as the 
      previously reported (TTTCA)(n) insertion in SAMD12. This insertion cosegregated 
      with familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy in 1 Chinese pedigree with 
      no (TTTCA)(n) insertion. In the targeted long-read sequencing of 2 patients and 1 
      asymptomatic carrier in this pedigree, with 1 previously reported (TTTCA)(n) 
      -insertion-carrying patient as a positive control, a respective total of 302, 
      159, 207, and 50 on-target subreads (predicated accuracy: >/=90%) spanning the 
      target repeat expansion region were generated. These sequencing data revealed the 
      accurate repeat expansion structures as (TTTTA)(114-123) (TTTGA)(108-116) in the 
      pedigree and (TTTTA)(38) (TTTCA)(479) in (TTTCA)(n) -insertion-carrying patient. 
      CONCLUSION: The targeted long-read sequencing helped us to elucidate the accurate 
      structures of the (TTTGA)(n) and (TTTCA)(n) insertions. Our finding offers a 
      novel possible cause for familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy and 
      might shed light on the identification of genetic causes of this disease in 
      pedigrees with no detected (TTTCA)(n) insertion in the reported causative genes.

TI  - Detecting a long insertion variant in SAMD12 by SMRT sequencing: implications of 
      long-read whole-genome sequencing for repeat expansion diseases.
PG  - 191-197
LID - 10.1038/s10038-018-0551-7 [doi]
AB  - Long-read sequencing technology is now capable of reading single-molecule DNA 
      with an average read length of more than 10 kb, fully enabling the coverage of 
      large structural variations (SVs). This advantage may pave the way for the 
      detection of unprecedented SVs as well as repeat expansions. Pathogenic SVs of 
      only known genes used to be selectively analyzed based on prior knowledge of 
      target DNA sequence. The unbiased application of long-read whole-genome 
      sequencing (WGS) for the detection of pathogenic SVs has just begun. Here, we 
      apply PacBio SMRT sequencing in a Japanese family with benign adult familial 
      myoclonus epilepsy (BAFME). Our SV selection of low-coverage WGS data (7x) 
      narrowed down the candidates to only six SVs in a 7.16-Mb region of the BAFME1 
      locus and correctly determined an approximately 4.6-kb SAMD12 intronic repeat 
      insertion, which is causal of BAFME1. These results indicate that long-read WGS 
      is potentially useful for evaluating all of the known SVs in a genome and 
      identifying new disease-causing SVs in combination with other genetic methods to 
      resolve the genetic causes of currently unexplained diseases.

TI  - TTTCA repeat expansion causes familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy.
PG  - 513-518
LID - 10.1111/ene.13848 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim was to investigate whether abnormal TTTTA and 
      TTTCA repeat expansions in introns of SAMD12, TNRC6A and RAPGEF2 are involved in 
      the pathogenesis of familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy (FCMTE). 
      METHODS: Five families diagnosed with FCMTE were included in the current genetic 
      analysis. Whole-exome sequencing was performed in selected patients of each 
      family. TTTTA and TTTCA expansions were examined by repeat-primed 
      polymerase chain reaction. The clinical features of FCMTE were elicited as 
      defined by the common genetic mechanism of 14 patients. RESULTS: Abnormal TTTCA 
      expansion was identified and co-segregated in all five FCMTE families, four 
      inserted in SAMD12 and one in RAPGEF2. The insertion of expanded TTTCA was not 
      found in 116 control alleles. TTTTA expansion in SAMD12 was detected in 90.9% 
      (10/11) of patients or mutation carriers; TTTTA expansion in RAPGEF2 was not 
      found. The onset age of myoclonic tremor was 27.4 +/- 5.9 (19-37) and epilepsy 
      usually presented around age 34. Focal and generalized seizures were witnessed 
      with various origins recorded by electroencephalogram. Cognitive deficits were 
      not common within the first 3 years after epilepsy onset. Emotional instability 
      was reported by most patients. No patients showed any cerebellar deficits. 
      Valproate added with clonazepam is effective in controlling seizures but cannot 
      guarantee a complete remission of tremor. Repeat length showed intergenerational 
      instability and was inversely correlated with age at onset of myoclonic tremor 
      and epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: TTTCA expansion insertion is associated with FCMTE in 
      Chinese families. The homogenous genetic mechanism allowed for a higher precision 
      of FCMTE description.

TI  - Long-read sequencing identified intronic repeat expansions in SAMD12 from Chinese 
      pedigrees affected with familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy.
PG  - 265-270
LID - 10.1136/jmedgenet-2018-105484 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The locus for familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy 
      (FCMTE) has long been mapped to 8q24 in linkage studies, but the causative 
      mutations remain unclear. Recently, expansions of intronic TTTCA and TTTTA repeat 
      motifs within SAMD12 were found to be involved in the pathogenesis of FCMTE in 
      Japanese pedigrees. We aim to identify the causative mutations of FCMTE in 
      Chinese pedigrees. METHODS: We performed genetic linkage analysis by 
      microsatellite markers in a five-generation Chinese pedigree with 55 members. We 
      also used array-comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) and next-generation 
      sequencing (NGS) technologies (whole-exome sequencing, capture region deep 
      sequencing and whole-genome sequencing) to identify the causative mutations in 
      the disease locus. Recently, we used low-coverage (~10x) long-read genome 
      sequencing (LRS) on the PacBio Sequel and Oxford Nanopore platforms to identify 
      the causative mutations, and used repeat-primed PCR for validation of the repeat 
      expansions. RESULTS: Linkage analysis mapped the disease locus to 8q23.3-24.23. 
      Array-CGH and NGS failed to identify causative mutations in this locus. LRS 
      identified the intronic TTTCA and TTTTA repeat expansions in SAMD12 as the 
      causative mutations, thus corroborating the recently published results in 
      Japanese pedigrees. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the pentanucleotide repeat 
      expansion in SAMD12 as the causative mutation in Chinese FCMTE pedigrees. Our 
      study also suggested that LRS is an effective tool for molecular diagnosis of 
      genetic disorders, especially for neurological diseases that cannot be positively 
      diagnosed by conventional clinical microarray and NGS technologies.

AB  - Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, and mutations in genes encoding ion 
      channels or neurotransmitter receptors are frequent causes of monogenic forms of 
      epilepsy. Here we show that abnormal expansions of TTTCA and TTTTA repeats in 
      intron 4 of SAMD12 cause benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy (BAFME). 
      Single-molecule, real-time sequencing of BAC clones and nanopore sequencing of 
      genomic DNA identified two repeat configurations in SAMD12. Intriguingly, in two 
      families with a clinical diagnosis of BAFME in which no repeat expansions in 
      SAMD12 were observed, we identified similar expansions of TTTCA and TTTTA repeats 
      in introns of TNRC6A and RAPGEF2, indicating that expansions of the same repeat 
      motifs are involved in the pathogenesis of BAFME regardless of the genes in which 
      the expanded repeats are located. This discovery that expansions of noncoding 
      repeats lead to neuronal dysfunction responsible for myoclonic tremor and 
      epilepsy extends the understanding of diseases with such repeat expansion.
