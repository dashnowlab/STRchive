AB  - Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), the leading indication for corneal 
      transplantation in the U.S., causes loss of corneal endothelial cells (CECs) and 
      corneal edema leading to vision loss. FECD pathogenesis is linked to impaired 
      response to oxidative stress and environmental ultraviolet A (UVA) exposure. 
      Although UVA is known to cause nonapoptotic oxidative cell death resulting from 
      iron-mediated lipid peroxidation, ferroptosis has not been characterized in FECD. 
      We investigated the roles of genetic background and UVA exposure in causing CEC 
      degeneration in FECD. Using ungenotyped FECD patient surgical samples, we found 
      increased levels of cytosolic ferrous iron (Fe(2+)) and lipid peroxidation in 
      end-stage diseased tissues compared with healthy controls. Using primary and 
      immortalized cell cultures modeling the TCF4 intronic trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion genotype, we found altered gene and protein expression involved in 
      ferroptosis compared to controls including elevated levels of Fe(2+), basal lipid 
      peroxidation, and the ferroptosis-specific marker transferrin receptor 1. 
      Increased cytosolic Fe(2+) levels were detected after physiologically relevant 
      doses of UVA exposure, indicating a role for ferroptosis in FECD disease 
      progression. Cultured cells were more prone to ferroptosis induced by RSL3 and 
      UVA than controls, indicating ferroptosis susceptibility is increased by both 
      FECD genetic background and UVA. Finally, cell death was preventable after RSL3 
      induced ferroptosis using solubilized ubiquinol, indicating a role for 
      anti-ferroptosis therapies in FECD. This investigation demonstrates that genetic 
      background and UVA exposure contribute to iron-mediated lipid peroxidation and 
      cell death in FECD, and provides the basis for future investigations of 
      ferroptosis-mediated disease progression in FECD.

TI  - Change in Visual Acuity of Patients With Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy Over 
      1 Year.
PG  - 1207-1215
LID - 10.1097/ICO.0000000000003590 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether the clinical and paraclinical course of Fuchs 
      endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) over 1 year is related to the extent of 
      triplet repetition in the transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene. METHODS: A 
      prospective study with a 1-year follow-up was conducted. A total of 104 patients 
      (160 eyes) with FECD and an equivalent number of age- and sex-matched control 
      subjects without FECD were included. At inclusion, the corneas were graded using 
      the modified Krachmer grade (KG) and patients were genotyped for the number of 
      trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) in the TCF4 gene by the short tandem repeat assay. 
      Visual acuity, Scheimpflug tomographic features, and the Visual Function and 
      Corneal Health Status using a visual disability instrument were measured on 2 
      visits at 1-year intervals. RESULTS: KGs ranged from 1 to 6, and 46% of eyes had 
      grades 1 to 4. 71% of the patients harbored TNR expansion (>40) versus 13% in 
      control subjects ( P < 0.001). Severity at inclusion was higher in the presence 
      of TNR expansion when considering eyes independently (mean grade +/-SD, 4.08 +/- 
      1.42) without TNR expansion and 4.66 +/- 1.27 with TNR expansion ( P = 0.024). In 1 
      year, the ETDRS score significantly decreased by -2.97 (95% confidence interval 
      -4.69 to -1.26, P = 0.001) and the ETDRS score with glare by -4.25 (95% 
      confidence interval -6.22 to -2.27, P < 10 -5 ). There was no relationship 
      between the rate of decline and TNR expansion or KG. Central corneal thickness 
      and Visual Function and Corneal Health Status scores did not significantly vary. 
      CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to measure a subtle progression of FECD over a period 
      as short as 1 year. We did not find a relationship between the presence of TNR 
      expansion and the speed of deterioration over 1 year. This work should facilitate 
      the design of future clinical trials on FECD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is the most common 
      repeat-mediated disease in humans. It exclusively affects corneal endothelial 
      cells (CECs), with </=81% of cases associated with an intronic TCF4 triplet repeat 
      (CTG18.1). Here, we utilise optical genome mapping (OGM) to investigate CTG18.1 
      tissue-specific instability to gain mechanistic insights. METHODS: We applied OGM 
      to a diverse range of genomic DNAs (gDNAs) from patients with FECD and controls 
      (n = 43); CECs, leukocytes and fibroblasts. A bioinformatics pipeline was 
      developed to robustly interrogate CTG18.1-spanning DNA molecules. All results 
      were compared with conventional polymerase chain reaction-based fragment 
      analysis. FINDINGS: Analysis of bio-samples revealed that expanded CTG18.1 
      alleles behave dynamically, regardless of cell-type origin. However, clusters of 
      CTG18.1 molecules, encompassing  approximately 1800-11,900 repeats, were exclusively detected 
      in diseased CECs from expansion-positive cases. Additionally, both progenitor 
      allele size and age were found to influence the level of leukocyte-specific 
      CTG18.1 instability. INTERPRETATION: OGM is a powerful tool for analysing somatic 
      instability of repeat loci and reveals here the extreme levels of CTG18.1 
      instability occurring within diseased CECs underpinning FECD pathophysiology, 
      opening up new therapeutic avenues for FECD. Furthermore, these findings 
      highlight the broader translational utility of FECD as a model for developing 
      therapeutic strategies for rarer diseases similarly attributed to somatically 
      unstable repeats. FUNDING: UK Research and Innovation, Moorfields Eye Charity,

TI  - Increased Risk of Glaucoma in Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy Is Independent 
      of TCF4 Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion.
LID - 10.1097/ICO.0000000000003695 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of glaucoma 
      and/or ocular hypertension (G/OHTN) in patients with Fuchs endothelial corneal 
      dystrophy (FECD) and correlate with FECD severity and TCF4 
      cytosine-thymine-guanine18.1 (CTG18.1) trinucleotide repeat expansion genotype. 
      METHODS: We included 167 FECD probands and 110 controls from the University of 
      Texas Southwestern Medical Center FECD Genetics Study to estimate the association 
      between FECD and G/OHTN. Participants underwent slit-lamp microscopy for the 
      assessment of Krachmer grade disease severity of FECD. The diagnosis of G/OHTN 
      was ascertained using a patient-reported history of G/OHTN, previous glaucoma 
      surgery and/or glaucoma laser procedure, and use of glaucoma drops. Genomic DNA 
      from blood of participants was used to genotype the CTG18.1 repeat polymorphism 
      by fragment analysis using short tandem repeat and triplet repeat primed 
      polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: We observed a 19.2% prevalence of 
      G/OHTN in the FECD probands compared with that of 7.3% in controls. The odds 
      ratio of developing G/OHTN in FECD cases compared with controls was estimated to 
      be 3.34 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.42-7.79 adjusting for age and sex. 
      Among FECD cases, the likelihood of developing G/OHTN correlated positively with 
      Krachmer grade (P = 0.043) and age (P = 0.026). There was no statistical 
      difference of the proportions of patients developing G/OHTN between FECD cases 
      with and without TCF4 CTG18.1 repeat expansion (16 out of 94 and 15 out of 72, 
      respectively, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with clinically significant FECD 
      should be routinely monitored for the development of glaucoma regardless of their 
      TCF4 repeat expansion genotype.

TI  - Deciphering novel TCF4-driven mechanisms underlying a common triplet repeat 
      expansion-mediated disease.

AB  - Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is an age-related cause of vision 
      loss, and the most common repeat expansion-mediated disease in humans 
      characterised to date. Up to 80% of European FECD cases have been attributed to 
      expansion of a non-coding CTG repeat element (termed CTG18.1) located within the 
      ubiquitously expressed transcription factor encoding gene, TCF4. The non-coding 
      nature of the repeat and the transcriptomic complexity of TCF4 have made it 
      extremely challenging to experimentally decipher the molecular mechanisms 
      underlying this disease. Here we comprehensively describe CTG18.1 
      expansion-driven molecular components of disease within primary patient-derived 
      corneal endothelial cells (CECs), generated from a large cohort of individuals 
      with CTG18.1-expanded (Exp+) and CTG 18.1-independent (Exp-) FECD. We employ 
      long-read, short-read, and spatial transcriptomic techniques to interrogate 
      expansion-specific transcriptomic biomarkers. Interrogation of long-read 
      sequencing and alternative splicing analysis of short-read transcriptomic data 
      together reveals the global extent of altered splicing occurring within Exp+ 
      FECD, and unique transcripts associated with CTG18.1-expansions. Similarly, 
      differential gene expression analysis highlights the total transcriptomic 
      consequences of Exp+ FECD within CECs. Furthermore, differential exon usage, 
      pathway enrichment and spatial transcriptomics reveal TCF4 isoform ratio skewing 
      solely in Exp+ FECD with potential downstream functional consequences. Lastly, 
      exome data from 134 Exp- FECD cases identified rare (minor allele frequency 
      <0.005) and potentially deleterious (CADD>15) TCF4 variants in 7/134 FECD Exp- 
      cases, suggesting that TCF4 variants independent of CTG18.1 may increase FECD 
      risk. In summary, our study supports the hypothesis that at least two distinct 
      pathogenic mechanisms, RNA toxicity and TCF4 isoform-specific dysregulation, both 
      underpin the pathophysiology of FECD. We anticipate these data will inform and 
      guide the development of translational interventions for this common 
      triplet-repeat mediated disease.

TI  - Transcription factor 4 promotes increased corneal endothelial cellular migration 
      by altering microtubules in Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy.
PG  - 10276

AB  - Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a complex corneal disease 
      characterized by the progressive decline and morphological changes of corneal 
      endothelial cells (CECs) that leads to corneal edema and vision loss. The most 
      common mutation in FECD is an intronic CTG repeat expansion in transcription 
      factor 4 (TCF4) that leads to its altered expression. Corneal endothelial wound 
      healing occurs primarily through cell enlargement and migration, and FECD CECs 
      have been shown to display increased migration speeds. In this study, we aim to 
      determine whether TCF4 can promote cellular migration in FECD CECs. We generated 
      stable CEC lines derived from FECD patients that overexpressed different TCF4 
      isoforms and investigated epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) expression, 
      morphological analysis and cellular migration speeds. We found that full length 
      TCF4-B isoform overexpression promotes cellular migration in FECD CECs in an 
      EMT-independent manner. RNA-sequencing identified several pathways including the 
      negative regulation of microtubules, with TUBB4A (tubulin beta 4A class IVa) as 
      the top upregulated gene. TUBB4A expression was increased in FECD ex vivo 
      specimens, and there was altered expression of cytoskeleton proteins, tubulin and 
      actin, compared to normal healthy donor ex vivo specimens. Additionally, there 
      was increased acetylation and detyrosination of microtubules in FECD supporting 
      that microtubule stability is altered in FECD and could promote cellular 
      migration. Future studies could be aimed at investigating if targeting the 
      cytoskeleton and microtubules would have therapeutic potential for FECD by 
      promoting cellular migration and regeneration.

TI  - Comparison of Scheimpflug and Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography 
      Imaging Parameters for Japanese Patients With Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy 
      With and Without TCF4 Repeat Expansions.
PG  - 805-811
LID - 10.1097/ICO.0000000000003488 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between 
      cytosine-thymine-guanine trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansion in TCF4 and the 
      clinical phenotypes of corneal densitometry or anterior segment morphology in 
      Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional 
      study included 150 eyes from 75 Japanese consecutive patients with Fuchs 
      endothelial corneal dystrophy. Cytosine-thymine-guanine repeat expansion of 
      leukocyte-derived genomic DNA was analyzed through fragment analysis using 
      polymerase chain reaction and triplet repeat primed polymerase chain reaction. 
      Scheimpflug-based densitometry and anterior segment optical coherence tomography 
      were applied. Corneal densitometry, and corneal and anterior segment morphology 
      parameters were compared between patients with and without TNR expansion of 50 or 
      more (expansion and nonexpansion groups, respectively) using a mixed model. 
      RESULTS: The average age of the patients was 66.8 +/- 13.0 years, and the modified 
      Krachmer grading scale was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for 7, 32, 28, 51, 6, and 18 
      eyes, respectively. Sixteen patients (21%) exhibited >/=50 TNR expansion. No 
      significant differences in sex, age, history of keratoplasty, modified Krachmer 
      grade, and corneal densitometry in either diameter or depth were observed between 
      the 2 groups. No significant differences in anterior segment morphology, 
      including the anterior chamber depth and anterior chamber angle width parameters, 
      were observed using a univariate mixed model, except for central corneal 
      thickness ( P = 0.047). However, according to the multivariate mixed model, 
      repeat expansion was not significantly associated with central corneal thickness 
      ( P = 0.27). CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in clinical phenotypes were 
      found between Japanese patients having Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy with 
      and without TNR expansion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the relationship between the number of trinucleotide 
      repeats (TNR) in late-onset Fuchs corneal endothelial dystrophy (FCED) and to 
      compare the endothelial properties of FCED, first-degree relatives, and controls. 
      METHODS: Blood samples were collected from FCEDs to determine TNR number. The 
      FCED patients, first-degree relatives, and controls were examined with specular 
      microscopy for central corneal thickness (CCT), endothelial cell density (ECD), 
      pleomorphism and polymegatism, and with corneal topography for specific 
      indicators such as (i) displacement of thinnest point of cornea, (ii) loss of 
      isopachs, (iii) focal posterior surface depression towards anterior chamber. 
      RESULTS: This study included 92 patients with FCED, 92 first-degree relatives, 
      and 96 controls. CCT was thickest in FCEDs (558.0 mum) (p < 0.05) while there was 
      no difference between relatives (533.0 mum) and controls (530.4 mum) (p = 0.845). 
      ECD was decreased in both FCED (2069.2 mm(2)) and relatives (2171.4 mm(2)) than 
      controls (2822.9 mm(2)) (p < 0.05 in both). The presence of pleomorphism and 
      polymegatism was significant in patients with FCED (93.4% and 93.4%, 
      respectively), relatives (86.9% and 86.04%, respectively), and controls (8.33% 
      and 1.04%, respectively) (p < 0.05). Specific topographic indicators differed 
      among the groups (p < 0.05). The mean repeat number of the FCED patients was 
      17.48 +/- 4.54 (12-25) times. The TNR number of FCED cases correlated with the 
      relative CCT (p < 0.05, R = 0.615) and cell density (p = 0.009, R = -0.499). 
      CONCLUSIONS: A strong association between the corneal endothelium in relatives 
      and TNR number of FCEDs was defined. Relatives tended to have fewer corneal 
      endothelial cells, even though they did not have clinical findings.

TI  - The TCF4 Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion of Fuchs' Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy: 
      Implications for the Anterior Segment of the Eye.
PG  - 16

LID - 16
AB  - PURPOSE: In the United States, 70% of Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) 
      cases are caused by an intronic trinucleotide repeat expansion in the TCF4 gene. 
      CUG repeat RNA transcripts from this expansion accumulate as nuclear foci in the 
      corneal endothelium. In this study, we sought to detect foci in other anterior 
      segment cell types and assess their molecular impact. METHODS: We examined CUG 
      repeat RNA foci appearance, expression of downstream affected genes, gene 
      splicing, and TCF4 RNA expression in corneal endothelium, corneal stromal 
      keratocytes, corneal epithelium, trabecular meshwork cells, and lens epithelium. 
      RESULTS: CUG repeat RNA foci, the hallmark of FECD in corneal endothelium (found 
      in 84% of endothelial cells), are less detectable in trabecular meshwork cells 
      (41%), much less prevalent in stromal keratocytes (11%) or corneal epithelium 
      (4%), and absent in lens epithelium. With few exceptions including mis-splicing 
      in the trabecular meshwork, differential gene expression and splicing changes 
      associated with the expanded repeat in corneal endothelial cells are not observed 
      in other cell types. Expression of the TCF4 transcripts including full-length 
      isoforms containing the repeat sequence at the 5' end is much higher in the 
      corneal endothelium or trabecular meshwork than in the corneal stroma or corneal 
      epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of the CUG repeat containing TCF4 transcripts 
      is higher in the corneal endothelium, likely contributing to foci formation and 
      the large molecular and pathologic impact on those cells. Further studies are 
      warranted to examine any glaucoma risk and impact of the observed foci in the 
      trabecular meshwork of these patients.

AB  - Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD), a late-onset oxidative stress 
      disorder, is the most common cause of corneal endothelial degeneration and is 
      genetically associated with CTG repeat expansion in Transcription Factor 4 
      (TCF4). We previously reported accumulation of nuclear (nDNA) and mitochondrial 
      (mtDNA) damage in FECD. Specifically, mtDNA damage was a prominent finding in 
      development of disease in the ultraviolet-A (UVA) induced FECD mouse model. We 
      hypothesize that an aberrant DNA repair may contribute to the increased DNA 
      damage seen in FECD. We analyzed differential expression profiles of 84 DNA 
      repair genes by real-time PCR arrays using Human DNA Repair RT-Profiler plates 
      using cDNA extracted from Descemet's membrane-corneal endothelium (DM-CE) 
      obtained from FECD patients with expanded (>40) or non-expanded (<40) intronic 
      CTG repeats in TCF4 gene and from age-matched normal donors. Change in mRNA 
      expression of <0.5- or >2.0-fold in FECD relative to normal was set as cutoff for 
      down- or upregulation. Downregulated mitochondrial genes were further validated 
      using the UVA-based mouse model of FECD. FECD specimens exhibited downregulation 
      of 9 genes and upregulation of 8 genes belonging to the four major DNA repair 
      pathways, namely, base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), 
      mismatch repair (MMR), and double strand break (DSB) repair, compared to normal 
      donors. MMR gene MSH2 and BER gene POLB were preferentially upregulated in 
      expanded FECD. BER genes LIG3 and NEIL2, DSB repair genes PARP3 and TOP3A, NER 
      gene XPC, and unclassified pathway gene TREX1, were downregulated in both 
      expanded and non-expanded FECD. MtDNA repair genes, Lig3, Neil2, and Top3a, were 
      also downregulated in the UVA-based mouse model of FECD. Our findings identify 
      impaired DNA repair pathways that may play an important role in DNA damage due to 
      oxidative stress as well as genetic predisposition noted in FECD.

AB  - PURPOSE: To characterise the phenotype and genotype of concurrent keratoconus and 
      Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (KC + FECD). METHODS: We recruited 20 
      patients with concurrent KC + FECD for a retrospective observational case series 
      from the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic. We compared eight parameters of 
      corneal shape (Pentacam, Oculus) with two groups of age-matched controls who had 
      either isolated keratoconus (KC) or isolated FECD. We genotyped probands for an 
      intronic triplet TCF4 repeat expansion (CTG18.1) and the ZEB1 variant c.1920G >T 
      p.(Gln640His). RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis of patients with KC + FECD 
      was 54 (interquartile range 46 to 66) years, with no evidence of KC progression 
      (median follow-up 84 months, range 12 to 120 months). The mean (standard 
      deviation (SD)) of the minimum corneal thickness, 493 (62.7) mum, was greater than 
      eyes with KC, 458 (51.1) mum, but less than eyes with FECD, 590 (55.6) mum. Seven 
      other parameters of corneal shape were more like KC than FECD. Seven (35%) 
      probands with KC + FECD had a TCF4 repeat expansion of >/=50 compared to five 
      controls with isolated FECD. The average of the largest TCF4 expansion in cases 
      with KC + FECD (46 repeats, SD 36 repeats) was similar to the age-matched 
      controls with isolated FECD (36 repeats, SD 28 repeats; p = 0.299). No patient 
      with KC + FECD harboured the ZEB1 variant. CONCLUSIONS: The KC + FECD phenotype 
      is consistent with KC but with superimposed stromal swelling from endothelial 
      disease. The proportion of cases with a TCF4 expansion is similar in concurrent 
      KC + FECD and age-matched controls with isolated FECD.

AB  - Late-onset Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a disease affecting the 
      corneal endothelium (CE), associated with a cytosine-thymine-guanine repeat 
      expansion at the CTG18.1 locus in the transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene. It is 
      unknown whether CTG18.1 expansions affect global methylation including TCF4 gene 
      in CE or whether global CE methylation changes at advanced age. Using genome-wide 
      DNA methylation array, we investigated methylation in CE from FECD patients with 
      CTG18.1 expansions and studied the methylation in healthy CE at different ages. 
      The most revealing DNA methylation findings were analyzed by gene expression and 
      protein analysis. 3488 CpGs had significantly altered methylation pattern in FECD 
      though no substantial changes were found in TCF4. The most hypermethylated site 
      was in a predicted promoter of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) gene, and the most 
      hypomethylated site was in a predicted promoter of coagulation factor V (F5 for 
      gene, FV for protein). In FECD, AQP1 mRNA expression was variable, while F5 gene 
      expression showed a ~ 23-fold increase. FV protein was present in both healthy 
      and affected CE. Further gene expression analysis of coagulation factors 
      interacting with FV revealed a ~ 34-fold increase of thrombomodulin (THBD). THBD 
      protein was detected only in CE from FECD patients. Additionally, we observed an 
      age-dependent hypomethylation in elderly healthy CE.Thus, tissue-specific 
      genome-wide and gene-specific methylation changes associated with altered gene 
      expression were discovered in FECD. TCF4 pathological methylation in FECD because 
      of CTG18.1 expansion was ruled out.

AB  - Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) have been found to play a role in a myriad of complex 
      traits and genetic diseases. We examined the variability in the lengths of over 
      850,000 STR loci in 996 children with suspected genetic disorders and 1,178 
      parents across six separate ancestral groups: Africans, Europeans, East Asians, 
      Admixed Americans, Non-admixed Americans, and Pacific Islanders. For each STR 
      locus we compared allele length between and within each ancestry group. In 
      relation to Europeans, admixed Americans had the most similar STR lengths with 
      only 623 positions either significantly expanded or contracted, while the 
      divergence was highest in Africans, with 4,933 chromosomal positions contracted 
      or expanded. We also examined probands to identify STR expansions at known 
      pathogenic loci. The genes TCF4, AR, and DMPK showed significant expansions with 
      lengths 250% greater than their various average allele lengths in 49, 162, and 11 
      individuals respectively. All 49 individuals containing an expansion in TCF4 and 
      six individuals containing an expansion in DMPK presented with allele lengths 
      longer than the known pathogenic length for these genes. Next, we identified 
      individuals with significant expansions in highly conserved loci across all 
      ancestries. Eighty loci in conserved regions met criteria for divergence. Two of 
      these individuals were found to have exonic STR expansions: one in ZBTB4 and the 
      other in SLC9A7, which is associated with X-linked mental retardation. Finally, 
      we used parent-child trios to detect and analyze de novo mutations. In total, we 
      observed 3,219 de novo expansions, where proband allele lengths are greater than 
      twice the longest parental allele length. This work helps lay the foundation for 
      understanding STR lengths genome-wide across ancestries and may help identify new 
      disease genes and novel mechanisms of pathogenicity in known disease genes.

TI  - Loss of Corneal Nerves and Corneal Haze in Patients with Fuchs' Endothelial

      Expansion.
PG  - 100214

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Seventy percent of Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) cases 
      are caused by an intronic trinucleotide repeat expansion in the transcription 
      factor 4 gene (TCF4). The objective of this study was to characterize the corneal 
      subbasal nerve plexus and corneal haze in patients with FECD with (RE+) and 
      without the trinucleotide repeat expansion (RE-) and to assess the correlation of 
      these parameters with disease severity. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, single-center 
      study. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-two eyes of 29 subjects with a modified Krachmer grade 
      of FECD severity from 1 to 6 were included in the study. Fifteen of the 29 
      subjects carried an expanded TCF4 allele length of >/= 40 cytosine-thymine-guanine 
      repeats (RE+). MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: In vivo confocal microscopy assessments of 
      corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL), corneal nerve branch density, corneal nerve 
      fiber density (CNFD), and anterior corneal stromal backscatter (haze); 
      Scheimpflug tomography densitometry measurements of haze in anterior, central, 
      and posterior corneal layers. RESULTS: Using confocal microscopy, we detected a 
      negative correlation between FECD severity and both CNFL and CNFD in the eyes of 
      RE+ subjects (Spearman rho = -0.45, P = 0.029 and rho = -0.62, P = 0.0015, 
      respectively) but not in the eyes of RE- subjects. Additionally, CNFD negatively 
      correlated with the repeat length of the expanded allele in the RE+ subjects 
      (Spearman rho = -0.42, P = 0.038). We found a positive correlation between anterior 
      stromal backscatter and severity in both the RE+ and RE- groups (rho = 0.60, P = 
      0.0023 and rho = 0.44, P = 0.024, respectively). The anterior, central, and 
      posterior Scheimpflug densitometry measurements also positively correlated with 
      severity in both the RE+ and RE- groups (P = 5.5 x 10(-5), 2.5 x 10(-4), and 
      2.9 x 10(-4), respectively, after adjusting for the expansion status in a pooled 
      analysis. However, for patients with severe FECD (Krachmer grades 5 and 6), the 
      posterior densitometry measurements were higher in the RE+ group than in the RE- 
      group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Loss of corneal nerves in FECD supports the 
      classification of the TCF4 trinucleotide repeat expansion disorder as a 
      neurodegenerative disease. Haze in the anterior, central, and posterior cornea 
      correlate with severity, irrespective of the genotype. Quantitative assessments 
      of corneal nerves and corneal haze may be useful to gauge and monitor FECD 
      disease severity in RE+ patients.

      expansion in multiple sclerosis.

LID - e156254
AB  - B cell depletion in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) 
      markedly prevents new MRI-detected lesions and disease activity, suggesting the 
      hypothesis that altered B cell function leads to the activation of T cells 
      driving disease pathogenesis. Here, we performed comprehensive analyses of CD40 
      ligand- (CD40L-) and IL-21-stimulated memory B cells from patients with MS and 
      healthy age-matched controls, modeling the help of follicular helper T cells (Tfh 
      cells), and found a differential gene expression signature in multiple B cell 
      pathways. Most striking was the impaired TIGIT expression on MS-derived B cells 
      mediated by dysregulation of the transcription factor TCF4. Activated circulating 
      Tfh cells (cTfh cells) expressed CD155, the ligand of TIGIT, and TIGIT on B cells 
      revealed their capacity to suppress the proliferation of IL-17-producing cTfh 
      cells via the TIGIT/CD155 axis. Finally, CCR6+ cTfh cells were significantly 
      increased in patients with MS, and their frequency was inversely correlated with 
      that of TIGIT+ B cells. Together, these data suggest that the dysregulation of

TI  - Lower Fractions of TCF4 Transcripts Spanning over the CTG18.1 Trinucleotide 
      Repeat in Human Corneal Endothelium.

AB  - Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a bilateral disease of the cornea 
      caused by gradual loss of corneal endothelial cells. Late-onset FECD is strongly 
      associated with the CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeat expansion in the Transcription 
      Factor 4 gene (TCF4), which forms RNA nuclear foci in corneal endothelial cells. 
      To date, 46 RefSeq transcripts of TCF4 are annotated by the National Center of 
      Biotechnology information (NCBI), however the effect of the CTG18.1 expansion on 
      expression of alternative TCF4 transcripts is not completely understood. To 
      investigate this, we used droplet digital PCR for quantification of TCF4 
      transcripts spanning over the CTG18.1 and transcripts with transcription start 
      sites immediately downstream of the CTG18.1. TCF4 expression was analysed in 
      corneal endothelium and in whole blood of FECD patients with and without CTG18.1 
      expansion, in non-FECD controls without CTG18.1 expansion, and in five additional 
      control tissues. Subtle changes in transcription levels in groups of TCF4 
      transcripts were detected. In corneal endothelium, we found a lower fraction of 
      transcripts spanning over the CTG18.1 tract compared to all other tissues 
      investigated.

TI  - Should Patients with Kearns-Sayre Syndrome and Corneal Endothelial Failure Be 
      Genotyped for a TCF4 Trinucleotide Repeat, Commonly Associated with Fuchs 
      Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy?
LID - 10.3390/genes12121918 [doi]
LID - 1918
AB  - The aim of this study was to describe the ocular phenotype in a case with 
      Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) spectrum and to determine if corneal endothelial cell 
      dysfunction could be attributed to other known distinct genetic causes. Herein, 
      genomic DNA was extracted from blood and exome sequencing was performed. 
      Non-coding gene regions implicated in corneal endothelial dystrophies were 
      screened by Sanger sequencing. In addition, a repeat expansion situated within an 
      intron of TCF4 (termed CTG18.1) was genotyped using the short tandem repeat 
      assay. The diagnosis of KSS spectrum was based on the presence of ptosis, chronic 
      progressive external ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary retinopathy, hearing loss, and 
      muscle weakness, which were further supported by the detection of ~6.5 kb mtDNA 
      deletion. At the age of 33 years, the proband's best corrected visual acuity was 
      reduced to 0.04 in the right eye and 0.2 in the left eye. Rare ocular findings 
      included marked corneal oedema with central corneal thickness of 824 and 844 microm 
      in the right and left eye, respectively. No pathogenic variants in the genes, 
      which are associated with corneal endothelial dystrophies, were identified. 
      Furthermore, the CTG18.1 genotype was 12/33, which exceeds a previously 
      determined critical threshold for toxic RNA foci appearance in corneal 
      endothelial cells.

AB  - Expansion of CTG trinucleotide repeats (TNR) in the transcription factor 4 (TCF4) 
      gene is highly associated with Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD). Due to 
      limitations in the availability of DNA from diseased corneal endothelium, sizing 
      of CTG repeats in FECD patients has typically been determined using DNA samples 
      isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes. However, it is non-feasible to extract 
      enough DNA from surgically isolated FECD corneal endothelial tissue to determine 
      repeat length based on current technology. To circumvent this issue, total RNA 
      was isolated from FECD corneal endothelium and sequenced using long-read 
      sequencing. Southern blotting of DNA samples isolated from primary cultures of 
      corneal endothelium from these same affected individuals was also assessed. Both 
      long read sequencing and Southern blot analysis showed significantly longer CTG 
      TNR expansion (>1000 repeats) in the corneal endothelium from FECD patients than 
      those characterized in leukocytes from the same individuals (<90 repeats). Our 
      findings suggest that the TCF4 CTG repeat expansions in the FECD corneal 
      endothelium are much longer than those found in leukocytes.

TI  - Impact of TCF4 Repeat Number on Resolution of Corneal Edema after Descemet's 
      Stripping Only in Fuchs Dystrophy: A Pilot Study.
LID - 10.3390/vision5040047 [doi]
LID - 47
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate whether Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) 
      genotype, specifically transcription factor 4 (TCF4) CTG triplet repeat "load" 
      predicts time to clearance following Descemet's Stripping Only (DSO). METHODS: 
      This prospective, interventional trial was conducted on consecutive FECD patients 
      undergoing DSO. Genetic analysis using patients' saliva was performed to assess 
      the extent of CTG expansion using short tandem repeat analysis, corroborated gel 
      electrophoresis and Sanger sequencing. Polymerase chain reaction and 
      bidirectional Sanger sequencing was undertaken. Partial least square regression 
      and logistic regression modelling was used to evaluate the predictive power of 
      TCF4 repeats on corneal clearance. RESULTS: Of 11 eyes of 11 patients, 8 showed 
      complete corneal clearance. For these 8 patients, mean TCF4 allele repeat was 
      24.8 (SD: 23.7, range: 11-63) and 63.4 (SD: 30.3; range: 11-97), respectively. In 
      total, 9/11 (81.8%) had expanded CTG repeats (>40) in one allele. In cases with 
      an allele repeat >/=80, there was a significantly increased risk of corneal 
      non-clearance (odds ratio 18.2, p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Whilst it was not 
      possible to predict time to corneal clearance based on CTG repeats, there is a 
      significant correlation between allele repeats and achievement of corneal 
      clearance.

TI  - TCF4 trinucleotide repeat expansion in Swedish cases with Fuchs' endothelial 
      corneal dystrophy.
PG  - 541-548
LID - 10.1111/aos.15032 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) has been considered a 
      genetically heterogeneous disease but is increasingly associated with the 
      transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene. This study investigates the prevalence of the 
      cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG)(n) repeat expansion in TCF4 among FECD patients in 
      northern Sweden coupled to the phenotype. METHODS: Blood samples were collected 
      from 85 FECD cases at different stages. Short tandem repeat PCR and triplet 
      repeat-primed PCR were applied in order to determine TCF4 (CTG)(n) genotype. 
      RESULTS: A (CTG)(n) repeat expansion (n > 50) in TCF4 was identified in 76 of 85 
      FECD cases (89.4%) and in four of 102 controls (3.9%). The median (CTG)(n) repeat 
      length was 81 (IQR 39.3) in mild FECD and 87 (IQR 13.0) in severe FECD 
      (p = 0.01). A higher number of (CTG)(n) repeats in an expanded TCF4 allele 
      increased the probability of severe FECD. Other ocular surgery was 
      overrepresented in FECD cases without a (CTG)(n) repeat expansion (44.4%, n = 4) 
      compared with 3.9% (n = 3) in FECD cases with an (CTG)(n) repeat expansion 
      (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In northern Sweden, the FECD phenotype is associated 
      with (CTG)(n) expansion in the TCF4 gene, with nearly 90% of patients being 
      hetero- or homozygous for (CTG)(n) expansion over 50 repeats. Furthermore, the 
      severity of FECD was associated with the repeat length in the TCF4 gene. Ocular 
      surgery might act as an environmental factor explaining the clinical disease in 
      FECD without a repeat expansion in TCF4.

TI  - Relationship of Body Mass Index With Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy Severity 
      and TCF4 CTG18.1 Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion.
PG  - 1567-1570
LID - 10.1097/ICO.0000000000002689 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the association of body mass index (BMI) with Fuchs 
      endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) severity and TCF4 CTG18.1 expansion. 
      METHODS: A total of 343 patients with FECD were enrolled from the Mayo Clinic. 
      FECD severity was graded by slit-lamp biomicroscopy. BMI values were obtained 
      from the electronic medical records. DNA extracted from leukocytes was analyzed 
      for CTG18.1 expansion length, with >/=40 repeats considered expanded. Wilcoxon 
      signed-rank tests were used to compare FECD grade and CTG18.1 expansion length in 
      patients by BMI (<25, >/=25 to <30, and >/=30 kg/m2). FECD grade was regressed on 
      age, sex, BMI, and CTG18.1 expansion and, separately, BMI on CTG18.1 expansion. 
      Models were investigated for effect modification by age and sex with an 
      interaction term of P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: When 
      examining the association between BMI and FECD, there was a significant 
      interaction between BMI and sex (P for interaction = 0.004). When controlling for 
      age and CTG18.1 expansion, a positive association was observed between BMI and 
      FECD grade in women, but not in men. In addition, BMI was not associated with 
      CTG18.1 expansion when controlling for age and sex. CONCLUSIONS: BMI was 
      positively associated with FECD severity among women but not men. There was no 
      significant association between BMI and CTG18.1 expansion. These findings suggest 
      that increased BMI is potentially a modifiable risk factor for FECD disease 
      progression among women.

TI  - Increased Corneal Endothelial Cell Migration in Fuchs Endothelial Corneal 
      Dystrophy: A Live Cell Imaging Study.
PG  - 100006
LID - 10.1016/j.xops.2021.100006 [doi]
LID - 100006
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate if corneal endothelial cells (CECs) in Fuchs endothelial 
      corneal dystrophy (FECD) have altered cellular migration compared with normal 
      controls. DESIGN: Comparative analysis. MATERIALS: Descemet's membrane and CECs 
      derived from patients with FECD undergoing endothelial keratoplasty or normal 
      cadaveric donors. METHODS: Ex vivo specimens were used for live cell imaging and 
      generation of immortalized cell lines. Live imaging was performed on FECD and 
      normal CECs and on ex vivo specimens transfected with green fluorescent protein. 
      Migration speeds were determined as a function of cellular density using 
      automated cell tracking. Ex vivo specimens were classified as either FECD or 
      normal low cell density (nonconfluent) or high cell density (confluent). Scratch 
      assay was performed on CECs seeded at high confluence to determine migration 
      speed. Genetic analysis from blood samples or CECs was performed to detect a CTG 
      repeat expansion in the TCF4 gene. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean cell migration 
      speed. RESULTS: Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy CECs in low cell density 
      areas displayed increased mean speed (0.391 +/- 0.005 mum/minute vs. 0.364 +/- 0.005 
      mum/minute; P < 0.001) and mean maximum speed (0.961 +/- 0.010 mum/minute vs. 0.787 +/- 
      0.011 mum/minute; P < 0.001) compared with normal CECs, and increased mean maximum 
      speed (0.778 +/- 0.014 mum/minute vs. 0.680 +/- 0.011 mum/minute; P < 0.001) in high 
      cell density areas ex vivo. Similarly, FECD CECs displayed increased mean speed 
      compared with normal CECs (1.958 +/- 0.020 mum/minute vs. 2.227 +/- 0.021 mum/minute 
      vs. 1.567 +/- 0.019 mum/minute; P < 0.001) under nonconfluent conditions in vitro. 
      Moreover, FECD CECs also displayed increased mean speed compared with normal CECs 
      under high confluent conditions as detected by scratch assay (37.2 +/- 1.1% vs. 
      44.3 +/- 4.1% vs. 70.7 +/- 5.2%; P < 0.001). Morphologic analysis showed that FECD 
      CECs displayed an increased fibroblastic phenotype as detected by 
      filamentous-actin labeling. CONCLUSIONS: Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy CECs 
      demonstrated increased migration speed compared with normal CECs. Further 
      investigation into the mechanisms of heightened cell migration in FECD is needed 
      and may provide insight into its pathogenesis, as well as having implications on 
      descemetorhexis without endothelial keratoplasty.

AB  - The CTG trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansion in Transcription factor 4 (TCF4) 
      intron 3 is the main cause of Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) and may 
      confer an increased risk of developing bipolar disorder (BD). Usage of 
      alternative 5' exons for transcribing the human TCF4 gene results in numerous 
      TCF4 transcripts which encode for at least 18 N-terminally different protein 
      isoforms that vary in their function and transactivation capability. Here we 
      studied the TCF4 region containing the CTG TNR and characterized the 
      transcription initiation sites of the nearby downstream 5' exons 4a, 4b and 4c. 
      We demonstrate that these exons are linked to alternative promoters and show that 
      the CTG TNR expansion decreases the activity of the nearby downstream TCF4 
      promoters in primary cultured neurons. We confirm this finding using two RNA 
      sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets of corneal endothelium from FECD patients with 
      expanded CTG TNR in the TCF4 gene. Furthermore, we report an increase in the 
      expression of various other TCF4 transcripts in FECD, possibly indicating a 
      compensatory mechanism. We conclude that the CTG TNR affects TCF4 expression in a 
      transcript-specific manner both in neurons and in the cornea.

TI  - Trinucleotide Repeat-Targeting dCas9 as a Therapeutic Strategy for Fuchs' 
      Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy.

AB  - PURPOSE: Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is the leading indication 
      for corneal transplantation. Seventy percent of cases are caused by an intronic 
      CTG triplet repeat expansion in the TCF4 gene that results in accumulation of 
      pathogenic expanded CUG repeat RNA (CUG(exp)) as nuclear foci in corneal 
      endothelium. A catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) can serve as an effective guide to 
      target genomic DNA or RNA transcripts. Here, we examined the utility of the 
      clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-dCas9 system 
      to effectively target and reduce CUG(exp). METHODS: We delivered dCas9 and 
      repeat-targeting single guide RNA (sgRNA) expression plasmids to patient-derived 
      endothelial cells using lipofection or lentiviral transduction. We used 
      fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and RNA dot-blot hybridization to 
      quantify CUG(exp) foci and repeat RNA levels, respectively. TCF4 expression 
      levels were assessed using quantitative PCR (qPCR). RESULTS: Using FISH, we found 
      that expression of both dCas9 and a (CAG)(n) sgRNA complementary to CUG(exp) are 
      necessary to reduce foci. We observed a reduction in percentage of cells with 
      foci from 59% to 5.6% and number of foci per 100 cells from 73.4 to 7.45 (P < 
      0.001) in cells stably expressing dCas9-(CAG)(n) sgRNA but saw no decrease in 
      cells expressing dCas9-(CUG)(n) sgRNA or nontargeting control sgRNA. In cells 
      with dCas9-(CAG)(n) sgRNA, we detected a reduction in CUG(exp) RNA by dot-blot 
      without any reduction in TCF4 mRNA levels using qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: Using 
      CRISPR-dCas9 to target the trinucleotide repeat is a promising treatment for FECD 
      contingent on effective in vivo delivery. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: This work 
      advances a gene therapy for a common age-related degenerative disorder.

TI  - Lower Corneal Haze and Aberrations in Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty 
      Versus Descemet Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty in Fellow Eyes for 
      Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy.
PG  - 1227-1234
LID - 10.1097/ICO.0000000000002416 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the long-term corneal changes in patients with Fuchs 
      endothelial corneal dystrophy contributing to superior postoperative visual 
      outcomes after Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) compared with 
      Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK). METHODS: Using 
      retrospective analysis, we evaluated 9 patients with Fuchs endothelial corneal 
      dystrophy who underwent DSAEK in 1 eye and DMEK in the fellow eye. Patients were 
      genotyped for the triplet repeat expansion in the TCF4 gene and imaged using 
      optical coherence tomography, Scheimpflug imaging, and in vivo confocal 
      microscopy through focusing. RESULTS: Eight of 9 subjects were genotyped, and all 
      were found to harbor the triplet repeat expansion. The average time between 
      endothelial keratoplasty and imaging was 76 +/- 22 and 37 +/- 9 months after DSAEK 
      and DMEK, respectively. The mean best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (logMAR) 
      was 0.04 +/- 0.05 and 0.11 +/- 0.03 in the DMEK eyes versus DSAEK eyes (P = 0.02), 
      respectively. Posterior corneal higher order aberrations were less in the DMEK 
      eyes compared with fellow DSAEK eyes (0.25 +/- 0.06 and 0.66 +/- 0.25, respectively, 
      P </= 0.01). Using confocal microscopy through focusing, we found that the 
      persistent anterior stromal haze was correlated between the right and left eyes 
      (R = 0.73, P </= 0.05), but total stromal backscattering was higher for the DSAEK 
      eyes (P </= 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: DSAEK inherently results in higher total stromal 
      backscattering (haze) compared with DMEK because of the addition of stromal 
      tissue. Lower higher order aberrations of the posterior cornea and lower total 
      stromal backscattering (haze) may both contribute to superior visual outcomes 
      after DMEK compared with DSAEK.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeat expansion in the transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene in Thai 
      patients with Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy.
PG  - 880-885
LID - 10.1038/s41433-019-0595-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
      and the intronic expansion of a trinucleotide repeat (TNR) in the TCF4 gene with 
      Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) in a Thai population. METHODS: In 
      total, 54 Thai FECD patients and 54 controls were recruited for the study. Five 
      SNPs (rs613872, rs2123392, rs17089887, rs1452787, and rs1348047), previously 
      reported to be associated with FECD, were genotyped by direct sequencing. The 
      repeat length was determined by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA (a short 
      tandem repeat; STR assay) and by triplet repeat primed PCR (TP-PCR). RESULTS: 
      Only one of the 54 patients with FECD harboured rs613872 (1.9%). Four SNPs 
      (rs2123392, rs17089887, rs1452787, and rs1348047), which are not rare 
      polymorphisms in the Thai population, were found in approximately half of the 
      patients. Of the 54 patients, 21 (1 homozygous and 20 heterozygous patients; 39%) 
      harboured a TNR >/= 40, while 33 patients (61%) harboured a TNR < 40. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The association of TNR expansion in TCF4 with FECD is shown for the first time in 
      the Thai population. The intronic TNR expansion identified in various ethnic 
      groups underlines the importance of expansion as a potent pathophysiological 
      cause of FECD.

TI  - Gene Expression and Missplicing in the Corneal Endothelium of Patients With a 
      TCF4 Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion Without Fuchs' Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy.
PG  - 3636-3643
LID - 10.1167/iovs.19-27689 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: CTG trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansion in an intron of the TCF4 gene 
      is the most common genetic variant associated with Fuchs' endothelial corneal 
      dystrophy (FECD). Although several mechanisms have been implicated in the disease 
      process, their exact pathophysiologic importance is unclear. To understand events 
      leading from TCF4 TNR expansion to disease phenotype, we characterized splicing, 
      gene expression, and exon sequence changes in a rare cohort of patients with TNR 
      expansions but no phenotypic FECD (RE+/FECD-). METHODS: Corneal endothelium and 
      blood were collected from patients undergoing endothelial keratoplasty for 
      non-FECD corneal edema. Total RNA was isolated from corneal endothelial tissue (n 
      = 3) and used for RNASeq. Gene splicing and expression was assessed by Mixture of 
      Isoforms (MISO) and MAP-RSeq software. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood 
      mononuclear cells and used for whole genome exome sequencing. Base calling was 
      performed using Illumina's Real-Time Analysis. RESULTS: Three genes (MBNL1, 
      KIF13A, AKAP13) that were previously identified as misspliced in patients with a 
      CTG TNR expansion and FECD disease (RE+/FECD+) were found normally spliced in 
      RE+/FECD- samples. Gene expression differences in pathways associated with the 
      innate immune response, cell signaling (e.g., TGFbeta, WNT), and cell senescence 
      markers were also identified between RE+/FECD- and RE+/FECD+ groups. No 
      consistent genetic variants were identified in RE+/FECD- patient exomes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Identification of novel splicing patterns and differential gene 
      expression in RE+/FECD- samples provides new insights and more relevant gene 
      targets that may be protective against FECD disease in vulnerable patients with 
      TCF4 CTG TNR expansions.

AB  - Amplification of a CAG trinucleotide motif (CTG18.1) within the TCF4 gene has 
      been strongly associated with Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD). 
      Nevertheless, a small minority of clinically unaffected elderly patients who have 
      expanded CTG18.1 sequences have been identified. To test the hypothesis that the 
      CAG expansions in these patients are protected from FECD because they have 
      interruptions within the CAG repeats, we utilized a combination of an 
      amplification-free, long-read sequencing method and a new target-enrichment 
      sequence analysis tool developed by Pacific Biosciences to interrogate the 
      sequence structure of expanded repeats. The sequencing was successful in 
      identifying a previously described interruption within an unexpanded allele and 
      provided sequence data on expanded alleles greater than 2000 bases in length. The 
      data revealed considerable heterogeneity in the size distribution of expanded 
      repeats within each patient. Detailed analysis of the long sequence reads did not 
      reveal any instances of interruptions to the expanded CAG repeats, but did reveal 
      novel variants within the AGG repeats that flank the CAG repeats in two of the 
      five samples from clinically unaffected patients with expansions. This first 
      examination of the sequence structure of CAG repeats in CTG18.1 suggests that 
      factors other than interruptions to the repeat structure account for the absence 
      of disease in some elderly patients with repeat expansions in the TCF4 gene.

TI  - Association of rs613872 and Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion in the TCF4 Gene of 
      German Patients With Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy.
PG  - 799-805

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and trinucleotide 
      repeat (TNR) expansion in the transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene in a large 
      cohort of German patients with Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD). 
      METHODS: Genomic DNA was obtained from 398 patients with FECD and from 58 
      non-FECD controls. Thirty-seven previously reported SNPs were evaluated by 
      genotyping. The 398 FECD samples were analyzed for TNR expansions by short tandem 
      repeat assays and Southern blotting. The possible associations between the TNR 
      length and clinical parameters (age, sex, visual acuity, and central corneal 
      thickness) were analyzed in 132 patients. RESULTS: The SNPs in COL8A2, TCF8, 
      LOXHD1, and AGBL1 showed no heterogeneity in 36 cases, although SLCA411 showed 3 
      nonsense mutations. SNPs were detected for TCF4 (rs613872, rs2123392, rs17089887, 
      rs1452787, and rs1348047), but only rs613872 showed a significant association 
      with FECD (P = 9.93 x 10). Overall, 315/398 (79%) patients harbored TNR lengths 
      >50, whereas no non-FECD controls harbored TNR lengths >50. The TCF4 SNP rs613872 
      genotype was TT: 39 (67%), TG: 18 (31%), and GG: 1 (2%) in non-FECD controls; TT: 
      39 (47%), TG: 38 (46%), and GG: 6 (7%) in FECD cases harboring TNR <50; and TT: 
      23 (8%), TG: 224 (79%), and GG: 38 (13%) in FECD cases harboring TNR >50 (P = 
      2.93 x 10). No significant association was detected between the TNR length and 
      clinical parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Our large German cohort demonstrated a 
      significant association between the risk allele G in rs613872 and FECD, 
      irrespective of TNR expansion, although this risk allele was more frequent in 
      FECD cases with TNR expansion than without.

TI  - Effect of Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion on the Expression of TCF4 mRNA in Fuchs' 
      Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy.
PG  - 779-786
LID - 10.1167/iovs.18-25760 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: CTG trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansion is frequently found in 
      transcription factor 4 (TCF4) in Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), 
      though the effect of TNR expansion on FECD pathophysiology remains unclear. The 
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of TNR expansion on TCF4 
      expression in corneal endothelium of patients with FECD. METHODS: Peripheral 
      blood DNA and Descemet membrane with corneal endothelium were obtained from 203 
      German patients with FECD. The CTG TNR repeat length in TCF4 was determined by 
      short tandem repeat (STR) assays and Southern blotting using genomic DNA. 
      Genotyping of rs613872 in TCF4 was performed by PCR. TCF4 mRNA levels in corneal 
      endothelium were evaluated by quantitative PCR using three different probes. 
      Control corneal endothelial samples were obtained from 35 non-FECD subjects. 
      RESULTS: The STR assay and Southern blotting showed that 162 of the 203 patients 
      with FECD (80%) harbored CTG trinucleotide repeat lengths larger than 50. 
      Quantitative PCR using all three probes demonstrated that TCF4 mRNA is 
      significantly upregulated in the corneal endothelium of patients with FECD, 
      regardless of the presence of TNR expansion. However, the length of the TNR 
      tended to show a positive correlation with TCF4 expression level. No correlation 
      was shown between the genotype of TCF4 SNP, rs613872, and the level of TCF4 
      expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that TCF4 mRNA is upregulated in the 
      corneal endothelium of patients with FECD. Further studies on the effects of TCF4 
      upregulation on corneal endothelial cell function will aid in understanding the 
      pathophysiology of FECD.

TI  - CRISPR/Cas9-targeted enrichment and long-read sequencing of the Fuchs endothelial 
      corneal dystrophy-associated TCF4 triplet repeat.
PG  - 2092-2102
LID - 10.1038/s41436-019-0453-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To demonstrate the utility of an amplification-free long-read sequencing 
      method to characterize the Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD)-associated 
      intronic TCF4 triplet repeat (CTG18.1). METHODS: We applied an amplification-free 
      method, utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 system, in combination with PacBio 
      single-molecule real-time (SMRT) long-read sequencing, to study CTG18.1. FECD 
      patient samples displaying a diverse range of CTG18.1 allele lengths and zygosity 
      status (n = 11) were analyzed. A robust data analysis pipeline was developed to 
      effectively filter, align, and interrogate CTG18.1-specific reads. All results 
      were compared with conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based fragment 
      analysis. RESULTS: CRISPR-guided SMRT sequencing of CTG18.1 provided accurate 
      genotyping information for all samples and phasing was possible for 18/22 alleles 
      sequenced. Repeat length instability was observed for all expanded (>/=50 repeats) 
      phased CTG18.1 alleles analyzed. Furthermore, higher levels of repeat instability 
      were associated with increased CTG18.1 allele length (mode length >/=91 repeats) 
      indicating that expanded alleles behave dynamically. CONCLUSION: CRISPR-guided 
      SMRT sequencing of CTG18.1 has revealed novel insights into CTG18.1 length 
      instability. Furthermore, this study provides a framework to improve the 
      molecular diagnostic accuracy for CTG18.1-mediated FECD, which we anticipate will 
      become increasingly important as gene-directed therapies are developed for this 
      common age-related and sight threatening disease.

TI  - CTG18.1 Expansion is the Best Classifier of Late-Onset Fuchs' Corneal Dystrophy 
      Among 10 Biomarkers in a Cohort From the European Part of Russia.
PG  - 4748-4754
LID - 10.1167/iovs.18-24590 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the occurrence and diagnostic performance of nine 
      single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the TCF4, SLC4A11, LOXHD1, and AGBL1 genes 
      and the CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeat expansion in a Russian cohort of Fuchs' 
      endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) patients. METHODS: This retrospective 
      case-control study included 100 patients diagnosed with FECD (cases) and 100 
      patients with cataracts (controls). Blood DNA was used to perform PCR and 
      subsequent Sanger sequencing of rs613872 and rs17595731 in TCF4, c.99-100delTC, 
      rs267607065, rs267607064, and rs267607066 in SLC4A11, rs113444922 in LOXHD1, and 
      rs181958589 and rs185919705 in AGBL1. The number of CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeats 
      was determined by a combination of conventional PCR or triplet primed PCR with 
      fragment analysis. RESULTS: At least one rs613872 marker allele was found in 78% 
      of FECD patients and 21% of controls, and at least one rs17595731 marker allele 
      was found in 14% and 2%, respectively. CTG18.1 trinucleotide expansion (>40 
      repeats) was detected in 72% of FECD patients and 5% of controls. Marker alleles 
      of the tested SNVs in SLC4A11, LOXHD1, and rs185919705 in AGBL1 were not found in 
      our FECD cohort. One FECD patient carried the marker allele of the rs181958589 
      SNV. Analysis of the diagnostic performance of individual markers in TCF4 and 
      their combinations showed that the CTG18.1 repeat expansion was the best 
      classifier for FECD (AUC = 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: Patients carrying CTG18.1 repeat 
      expansion constituted a high proportion of the Russian FECD cohort; therefore, 
      this marker is suitable for development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

TI  - Clinical and genetic investigation of amantadine-associated corneal edema.
PG  - 1367-1371
LID - 10.2147/OPTH.S166384 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Amantadine use has been temporally associated with bilateral corneal 
      edema in a series of cases; however, its pathophysiological mechanisms have yet 
      to be elucidated. We sought to rule out subclinical Fuchs dystrophy as a 
      contributor, characterize its pattern of corneal edema, and describe the 
      long-term outcome of concurrent topical steroids while resuming amantadine. 
      PATIENT AND METHODS: After a 44-year-old woman presented with new acute onset 
      bilateral corneal edema, amantadine was discontinued, with clinical improvement. 
      However, neurological decompensation required restarting amantadine, which she 
      did concurrently with topical loteprednol. To determine whether subclinical Fuchs 
      dystrophy might be present, triplet-primed polymerase chain reaction was 
      conducted to measure copy number of the CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeat in TCF4. 
      Specular microscopy and Scheimpflug imaging were conducted and followed for 32 
      months to assess for resolution and stability. Literature review was conducted to 
      assess for consistency of the clinical phenotype. RESULTS: Corneal edema resolved 
      clinically 4 weeks after discontinuation of amantadine. Serial Scheimpflug 
      imaging demonstrated resolution of posterior and central corneal edema and 
      specular microscopy revealed intracellular opacities with loss of endothelial 
      cell density. Despite resuming amantadine, Scheimpflug imaging and specular 
      microscopy measurements remained stable at 32 months. Triplet-primed PCR of 
      CTG18.1 in TCF4 revealed no trinucleotide repeat expansion. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Amantadine-associated corneal edema is characteristically posterior and central 
      and appears unlikely to represent early or subclinical decompensation of Fuchs 
      dystrophy. We describe the unique outcome of continued corneal clearance after 
      restarting amantadine concurrently with steroids, a pattern that has persisted 
      over 32 months to date.

TI  - Instability of TCF4 Triplet Repeat Expansion With Parent-Child Transmission in 
      Fuchs' Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy.
PG  - 4065-4070
LID - 10.1167/iovs.18-24119 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) caused by the CTG triplet 
      repeat expansion in the TCF4 gene (CTG18.1 locus) is the most common repeat 
      expansion disorder. Intergenerational instability of expanded repeats and 
      clinical anticipation are hallmarks of other repeat expansion disorders. In this 
      study, we examine stability of triplet repeat allele length and FECD disease 
      severity in parent-child transmission of the expanded CTG18.1 allele. METHODS: We 
      studied 44 parent-child transmissions of the mutant expanded CTG18.1 allele from 
      26 FECD families. The CTG18.1 polymorphism was genotyped using short tandem 
      repeat analysis, triplet repeat primed PCR assay, and Southern blot analysis. 
      FECD severity was assessed using modified Krachmer grading (KG) system. Triplet 
      repeat length of mutant allele and KG severity were compared between generations. 
      RESULTS: Instability of the expanded allele was seen in 14 of 44 (31.8%) 
      parent-child transmissions, and the likelihood of an unstable event increased 
      with the size of the parental allele (P = 5.9 x 10;-3). A tendency for 
      contraction was seen in transmission of large alleles (repeat length > 120), 
      whereas intermediate alleles (repeat length between 77 and 120) had predilection 
      for further expansion (P = 1.3 x 10; - 3). Although we noted increased KG 
      severity in the offspring in three pairs, none of these transmissions were 
      associated with allele instability. CONCLUSIONS: We observed instability of the 
      TCF4 triplet repeat expansion in nearly a third of parent-child transmissions. 
      Large mutant CTG18.1 alleles are prone to contraction, whereas intermediate 
      mutant alleles tend to expand when unstably transmitted. Intergenerational 
      instability of TCF4 repeat expansion has implications on FECD disease 
      inheritance.

LID - e0200005
AB  - Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FECD) is a late onset, autosomal dominant 
      eye disease that can lead to loss of vision. Expansion of a CTG trinucleotide 
      repeat in the third intron of the transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene is highly 
      associated with FECD. However, only about 75% of FECD patients in the northern 
      European population possess an expansion of this repeat. The remaining FECD cases 
      appear to be associated with variants in other genes. To better understand the 
      pathophysiology of this disease, we compared gene expression profiles of corneal 
      endothelium from FECD patients with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (RE+) to 
      those that do not have a repeat expansion (RE-). Comparative analysis of these 
      two cohorts showed widespread RNA mis-splicing in RE+, but not in RE- samples. 
      Quantitatively, we identified 39 genes in which expression was significantly 
      different between RE+ and RE- samples. Examination of the mutation profiles in 
      the RE- samples did not find any mutations in genes previously associated with 
      FECD, but did reveal one sample with a rare variant of laminin subunit gamma 1 
      (LAMC1) and three samples with rare variants in the gene coding for the 
      mitochondrial protein peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor-associated protein 
      1 (TSPOAP1).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a complex degenerative 
      disease of the corneal endothelium with genetic predisposition. Pathogenic rare 
      variants have been identified in SLC4A11, LOXHD1, ZEB1, and AGBL1. Association of 
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and CTG trinucleotide repeat expansions in 
      the intron of TCF4 gene to FECD has been studied across multiple ethnicities. 
      Recently, genome-wide association studies have also identified KANK4, LAMC1, and 
      ATP1B1 as novel loci for FECD. Here, we report the contribution of ZEB1 and 
      LOXHD1 genes in our sporadic late-onset FECD cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 
      the experimental study, coding regions of ZEB1 and LOXHD1 were screened by Sanger 
      DNA sequencing in 52 late-onset and 5 early-onset FECD cases of Indian origin, 
      recruited at a tertiary eye care center. Further, bioinformatics analysis was 
      done. RESULTS: One reported missense mutation, c.2522A>C; p.(Q841P), and one 
      variant of uncertain significance (VUS), c.619A>G; p.(S207G), were identified in 
      the ZEB1 gene. One VUS, c.6413G>Ap.(R2138Q), was observed in LOXHD1. A 3D 
      structural bioinformatic analysis of the missense variant in LOXHD1 predicted the 
      variant to affect the structure-function relationship of the protein. DISCUSSION: 
      While mutations in ZEB1 contributed to 2% of the late-onset FECD cases, the exact 
      role of the two VUS identified in ZEB1 and LOXHD1 in FECD pathogenesis needs to 
      be studied.

AB  - Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a common disease for which corneal 
      transplantation is the only treatment option in advanced stages, and alternative 
      treatment strategies are urgently required. Expansion (>/=50 copies) of a 
      non-coding trinucleotide repeat in TCF4 confers >76-fold risk for FECD in our 
      large cohort of affected individuals. An FECD subject-derived corneal endothelial 
      cell (CEC) model was developed to probe disease mechanism and investigate 
      therapeutic approaches. The CEC model demonstrated that the repeat expansion 
      leads to nuclear RNA foci, with the sequestration of splicing factor proteins 
      (MBNL1 and MBNL2) to the foci and altered mRNA processing. Antisense 
      oligonucleotide (ASO) treatment led to a significant reduction in the incidence 
      of nuclear foci, MBNL1 recruitment to the foci, and downstream aberrant splicing 
      events, suggesting functional rescue. This proof-of-concept study highlights the 
      potential of a targeted ASO therapy to treat the accessible and tractable corneal 
      tissue affected by this repeat expansion-mediated disease.

TI  - Oligonucleotides targeting TCF4 triplet repeat expansion inhibit RNA foci and 
      mis-splicing in Fuchs' dystrophy.
PG  - 1015-1026
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddy018 [doi]
AB  - Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is the most common repeat expansion 
      disorder. FECD impacts 4% of U.S. population and is the leading indication for 
      corneal transplantation. Most cases are caused by an expanded intronic CUG tract 
      in the TCF4 gene that forms nuclear foci, sequesters splicing factors and impairs 
      splicing. We investigated the sense and antisense RNA landscape at the FECD gene 
      and find that the sense-expanded repeat transcript is the predominant species in 
      patient corneas. In patient tissue, sense foci number were negatively correlated 
      with age and showed no correlation with sex. Each endothelial cell has  approximately 2 sense 
      foci and each foci is single RNA molecule. We designed antisense oligonucleotides 
      (ASOs) to target the mutant-repetitive RNA and demonstrated potent inhibition of 
      foci in patient-derived cells. Ex vivo treatment of FECD human corneas 
      effectively inhibits foci and reverses pathological changes in splicing. FECD has 
      the potential to be a model for treating many trinucleotide repeat diseases and 
      targeting the TCF4 expansion with ASOs represents a promising therapeutic 
      strategy to prevent and treat FECD.

TI  - CTG18.1 Expansion in TCF4 Among African Americans With Fuchs' Corneal Dystrophy.
PG  - 6046-6049
LID - 10.1167/iovs.17-21661 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Studies of Fuchs' dystrophy have largely focused on individuals of 
      European origin. Characterization of disease among African Americans is required 
      to ensure prognostic factors and therapeutic approaches are applicable across 
      diverse patient populations. METHODS: We assessed all self-reported black and 
      white patients aged older than 40 years at a tertiary care institution with a 
      diagnosis of cataract over a 3-year period for concurrent diagnosis of Fuchs' 
      dystrophy. Affected patients in a longitudinal cohort were invited to provide a 
      blood sample from which we extracted genomic DNA. The CTG18.1 trinucleotide 
      repeat length was determined using a two-step, triplet repeat primed PCR 
      protocol. Expansion was defined as >40 CTG repeats. Demographic information, 
      including race, was documented. RESULTS: Of 59,365 self-reported black and white 
      adults who presented for cataract evaluation, the odds ratio of presenting with 
      Fuchs' dystrophy among black compared to white patients was 0.6992 (95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 0.6210-0.7872). A total of 60 black and 549 white 
      patients with Fuchs' corneal dystrophy enrolled in the longitudinal study, of 
      which 21 (35.0%) black and 343 (62.5%) white patients demonstrated trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion, a significant difference (P = 7.7 x 10-5). In a multivariable 
      linear regression model, repeat expansion but not race was significantly 
      associated with mean clinical grading of severity. CONCLUSIONS: Black patients 
      with Fuchs' dystrophy were less likely than white patients to demonstrate CTG18.1 
      allele expansion. The data contribute to our understanding of population 
      differences in clinical presentation, and highlight the need for considering 
      diversity of patient populations in clinical research.

TI  - Association of polymorphisms in the intron of TCF4 gene to late-onset Fuchs 
      endothelial corneal dystrophy: An Indian cohort study.
PG  - 931-935
LID - 10.4103/ijo.IJO_191_17 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a progressive degenerative 
      disease of the corneal endothelium. It is genetically heterogeneous and follows 
      either an autosomal dominant or sporadic pattern of inheritance. Here, we have 
      explored the association of four previously reported intronic single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms and intronic CTG repeat expansions in TCF4 gene to FECD in an 
      Indian cohort. METHODS: The cohort consisting of 52 sporadic late-onset cases, 5 
      early-onset cases, and 148 controls was taken for the study. rs2286812 and 
      rs613872 were genotyped by allele specific polymerase chain reaction (ASPCR) and 
      PCR-based restriction digestion, respectively; rs17595731 and rs9954153 were 
      genotyped by Taqman assay using real-time PCR. The quantitative assessment of the 
      CTG repeat region was performed by PCR/Sanger DNA sequencing. The repeats were 
      assessed qualitatively by short tandem repeat and triplet repeat primed PCR 
      assays. The statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed Fisher's exact 
      probability test. RESULTS: SNPsrs613872 (G/T) for the 'G' allele (P value: 4.57 x 
      10-5) and rs17595731 (C/T) for the 'C' allele (P value: 1.87 x 10-5), 
      respectively, showed a significant association to sporadic late-onset FECD. CTG 
      repeat expansions were found to be associated with FECD with a P value = 2.4 x 
      10-3. CONCLUSION: rs613872, rs17595731, and CTG repeat expansions in intronic 
      region of TCF4 are associated with increased risk of sporadic late-onset FECD in 
      the Indian cohort studied.

TI  - Fuchs' Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy and RNA Foci in Patients With Myotonic 
      Dystrophy.
PG  - 4579-4585
LID - 10.1167/iovs.17-22350 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The most common cause of Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is 
      an intronic CTG repeat expansion in TCF4. Expanded CUG repeat RNA colocalize with 
      splicing factor, muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1), in nuclear foci in endothelium as a 
      molecular hallmark. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a neuromuscular disorder 
      caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of DMPK. In 
      this study, we examine for RNA-MBNL1 foci in endothelial cells of FECD subjects 
      with DM1, test the hypothesis that DM1 patients are at risk for FECD, and 
      determine prevalence of TCF4 and DMPK expansions in a FECD cohort. METHODS: Using 
      FISH, we examined for nuclear RNA-MBNL1 foci in endothelial cells from FECD 
      subjects with DM1. We examined 13 consecutive unrelated DM1 patients for FECD 
      using slit-lamp and specular microscopy. We genotyped TCF4 and DMPK repeat 
      polymorphisms in a FECD cohort of 317 probands using short-tandem repeat and 
      triplet repeat-primed PCR assays. RESULTS: We detected abundant nuclear RNA foci 
      colocalizing with MBNL1 in endothelial cells of FECD subjects with DM1. Six of 
      thirteen DM1 patients (46%) had slit-lamp and specular microscopic findings of 
      FECD, compared to 4% disease prevalence (P = 5.5 x 10-6). As expected, 222 out of 
      317 (70%) FECD probands harbored TCF4 expansion, while one subject harbored DMPK 
      expansion without prior diagnosis of DM1. CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that DM1 
      patients are at risk for FECD. DMPK mutations contribute to the genetic burden of 
      FECD but are uncommon. We establish a connection between two repeat expansion 
      disorders converging upon RNA-MBNL1 foci and FECD.

TI  - TGC repeat expansion in the TCF4 gene increases the risk of Fuchs' endothelial 
      corneal dystrophy in Australian cases.
PG  - e0183719

LID - e0183719
AB  - Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a progressive, vision impairing 
      disease. Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a trinucleotide repeat 
      polymorphism, thymine-guanine-cytosine (TGC), in the TCF4 gene have been 
      associated with the risk of FECD in some populations. We previously reported 
      association of SNPs in TCF4 with FECD risk in the Australian population. The aim 
      of this study was to determine whether TGC repeat polymorphism in TCF4 is 
      associated with FECD in the Australian population. In 189 unrelated Australian 
      cases with advanced late-onset FECD and 183 matched controls, the TGC repeat 
      polymorphism located in intron 3 of TCF4 was genotyped using a short tandem 
      repeat (STR) assay. The repeat length was verified by direct sequencing in 
      selected homozygous carriers. We found significant association between the 
      expanded TGC repeat (>/= 40 repeats) in TCF4 and advanced FECD (P = 2.58 x 10-22; 
      OR = 15.66 (95% CI: 7.79-31.49)). Genotypic analysis showed that 51% of cases 
      (97) compared to 5% of controls (9) were heterozygous or homozygous for the 
      expanded repeat allele. Furthermore, the repeat expansion showed stronger 
      association than the most significantly associated SNP, rs613872, in TCF4, with 
      the disease in the Australian cohort. This and haplotype analysis of both the 
      polymorphisms suggest that considering both the polymorphisms together rather 
      than either of the two alone would better predict susceptibility to FECD in the 
      Australian population. This is the first study to report association of the TGC 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in TCF4 with advanced FECD in the Australian 
      population.

TI  - CTG18.1 repeat expansion may reduce TCF4 gene expression in corneal endothelial 
      cells of German patients with Fuchs' dystrophy.
PG  - 1621-1631
LID - 10.1007/s00417-017-3697-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: It was the aim of this investigation to elucidate the functional effects 
      of CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeat expansion and the polymorphism rs613872 in the 
      transcription factor 4 (TCF4) in corneas of patients affected by Fuchs' 
      endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD). METHODS: Sixty-one unrelated German 
      patients with FECD and 113 unaffected controls were investigated and genotyped 
      for the CTG18.1 locus by triplet primed PCR (TP-PCR) and the rs613872 
      polymorphism via Sanger sequencing and by employing genomic DNA from peripheral 
      blood leucocytes. DNA and RNA retrieved from human corneal endothelial explants 
      were examined for alterations in the gene expression of TCF4, ZEB1, E-cadherin, 
      N-cadherin, as well as the CTG18.1 locus. RESULTS: The CTG18.1 trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion (>50 repeats) was detected in the peripheral blood in 77% of 
      affected FECD patients and 11.5% of the healthy volunteers. Applying the TP-PCR 
      method, the length of CTG18.1 repeat expansions correlates in the blood and 
      corneal cells. We noted that the CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeat expansion was 
      associated with reduced TCF4 and ZEB1 gene expression, especially in the 
      explanted corneal endothelial cells. While E-cadherin gene expression was not 
      detected in any corneal endothelial cells, expression of CDH2 (N-cadherin) was 
      detected in FECD-affected endothelium and in our controls. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      CTG18.1 repeat expansion may reduce gene expression of TCF4 and ZEB1, suggesting 
      that a mechanism triggering a loss of function may contribute to FECD. The 
      correlation of CTG18.1 repeat expansion from blood and the cornea may represent 
      the first step toward investigating the potential relevance of testing the blood 
      of cornea donors to minimize the risk of transplanting grafts potentially 
      affected with FECD.

TI  - Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion in the Transcription Factor 4 (TCF4) Gene Leads to 
      Widespread mRNA Splicing Changes in Fuchs' Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy.
PG  - 343-352
LID - 10.1167/iovs.16-20900 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify RNA missplicing events in human corneal endothelial tissue 
      isolated from Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD). METHODS: Total RNA was 
      isolated and sequenced from corneal endothelial tissue obtained during 
      keratoplasty from 12 patients with FECD and 4 patients undergoing keratoplasty or 
      enucleation for other indications. The length of the trinucleotide repeat (TNR) 
      CTG in the transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene was determined using 
      leukocyte-derived DNA analyzed by a combination of Southern blotting and Genescan 
      analysis. Commercial statistical software was used to quantify expression of 
      alternatively spliced genes. Validation of selected alternative splicing events 
      was performed by using RT-PCR. Gene sets identified were analyzed for 
      overrepresentation using Web-based analysis system. RESULTS: Corneal endothelial 
      tissue from FECD patients containing a CTG TNR expansion sequence in the TCF4 
      gene revealed widespread changes in mRNA splicing, including a novel splicing 
      event involving FGFR2. Differential splicing of NUMA1, PPFIBP1, MBNL1, and MBNL2 
      transcripts were identified in all FECD samples containing a TNR expansion. The 
      differentially spliced genes were enriched for products that localize to the cell 
      cortex and bind cytoskeletal and cell adhesion proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Corneal 
      endothelium from FECD patients harbors a unique signature of mis-splicing events 
      due to CTG TNR expansion in the TCF4 gene, consistent with the hypothesis that 
      RNA toxicity contributes to the pathogenesis of FECD. Changes to the endothelial 
      barrier function, a known event in the development of FECD, was identified as a 
      key biological process influenced by the missplicing events.

TI  - CTG18.1 Expansion in TCF4 Increases Likelihood of Transplantation in Fuchs 
      Corneal Dystrophy.
PG  - 40-43
AB  - PURPOSE: Fuchs dystrophy is the leading indication of corneal transplantation in 
      the United States. A CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeat in TCF4 correlates with 
      increased severity in Fuchs dystrophy; however, quantitative estimates of 
      increased transplantation risk, including effects of age and sex, are unclear. 
      METHODS: In a tertiary institution clinical practice, 574 participants were 
      enrolled in a longitudinal study of Fuchs dystrophy after slit-lamp biomicroscopy 
      confirmed significant central guttae and/or corneal transplantation in both eyes. 
      We documented clinical history, examination findings, and demographic 
      information. We acquired blood samples, extracted DNA, and sequenced the CTG18.1 
      trinucleotide repeat in TCF4. In this retrospective case-control study, the 
      number of participants with triplet expansion, defined as greater than 40 CTG 
      repeats, and transplantation status were assessed. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 
      timing and transplantation events were produced. The Cox proportional hazard 
      regression model was used to assess the relationship between age, sex, triplet 
      expansion, and surgery. RESULTS: A total of 106 participants (18.5%) previously 
      underwent corneal transplantation in at least 1 eye at the time of initial 
      evaluation. A higher proportion of individuals harboring allele expansion had 
      undergone transplantation (78/357, 21.8%) compared with those without the 
      expanded allele (28/217, 12.9%), a significant association (P = 0.007). The 
      log-rank test demonstrates a significant difference in survival function over 
      time (P = 0.027), with a hazard ratio of 1.64 (95% confidence interval, 
      1.05-2.55). CONCLUSIONS: Expansion of the TCF4 CTG trinucleotide repeat was 
      associated with 1.64 times higher likelihood of corneal transplantation at a 
      given age in patients with Fuchs dystrophy.

      Repeat Expansion in TCF4.
PG  - 1386-91
LID - 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2015.3430 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The CTG18.1 triplet repeat expansion in TCF4 has recently been found 
      to be a common functional variant contributing significant risk to the 
      development of Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) in Eurasian 
      populations. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of the expanded CTG18.1 allele 
      of TCF4 on FECD severity and to correlate CTG triplet repeat allele length to the 
      severity of FECD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a cross-sectional 
      analysis, we studied 139 index cases (probands and unrelated individuals) with 
      FECD recruited from a cornea referral practice at the University of Texas 
      Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, from April 2010 through February 2015. The 
      triplet repeat polymorphism CTG18.1 was genotyped using a combination of short 
      tandem repeat analysis, triplet repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction assay, 
      and Southern blot analysis. Severity of FECD was graded using a modified Krachmer 
      grading system (severity scale of 0-6 based on extent of confluent guttae). MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The CTG triplet repeat length of the largest allele was 
      compared with the Krachmer grade of FECD severity, keratoplasty proportion, and 
      central corneal thickness in the white subset. RESULTS: Eighty-five of 122 white 
      index cases with FECD (69.7%) harbored the triplet repeat expansion. The mean 
      (SD) Krachmer grade was 5.61 (0.76) in the group with the repeat expansion 
      compared with 5.11 (1.05) in the group without the expanded repeats (P = .01). 
      Forty-seven participants with the repeat expansion (55.3%) had undergone 
      keratoplasty at the time of recruitment, compared with 13 (35.1%) of those 
      without the expansion (P = .0497). There was a positive correlation of Krachmer 
      grade to triplet repeat number (P = .002) and a nominal association of the 
      keratoplasty proportion with triplet repeat number (P = .04). The mean (SD) 
      central corneal thickness was 605.9 (50.5) mum in the group with the expanded 
      repeats compared with 581.3 (50.5) mum in the group without the expansion 
      (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The Krachmer grade of disease severity was 
      greater in FECD cases with the CTG18.1 triplet repeat expansion in TCF4 than in 
      those without the expansion. The CTG triplet repeat allele length was positively 
      correlated with the Krachmer grade of severity. The TCF4 triplet repeat expansion 
      resulted in a more severe form of FECD, with clinical and surgical therapeutic 
      implications.

TI  - Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion in the TCF4 Gene in Fuchs' Endothelial Corneal 
      Dystrophy in Japanese.
PG  - 4865-9
LID - 10.1167/iovs.15-17082 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between the 
      intronic expansion of a trinucleotide repeat (TNR) in the TCF4 gene and Fuchs' 
      endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) in a Japanese population. METHODS: 
      Forty-seven Japanese FECD patients and 96 age-matched controls were recruited. 
      FECD patients and controls were examined by slit-lamp and noncontact specular 
      microscopy. The repeat length was determined by direct sequencing and short 
      tandem repeat assay of PCR-amplified DNA and Southern blotting of unamplified 
      DNA. RESULTS: A TNR expansion, defined as >50 CTG repeats in the TCF4 gene was 
      identified in 12 of 47 FECD cases (26%) and 0 of 96 controls (0%; P < 0.001). 
      Sensitivity and specificity in this study were 26% and 100%, respectively. The 
      clinical characteristics of FECD patients with TNR expansion were not distinct 
      from those without TNR expansion. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show for the first 
      time in a Japanese population the association of the TNR expansion in TCF4 with 
      FECD. In contrast to Caucasian cohorts in whom the TNR expansion is present in 
      most patients with FECD, a CTG expansion is present in a minority of Japanese 
      subjects, indicating other genetic variants as common causes of phenotypically 
      identical disease in this population.

TI  - Expansion of CTG18.1 Trinucleotide Repeat in TCF4 Is a Potent Driver of Fuchs' 
      Corneal Dystrophy.
PG  - 4531-6
LID - 10.1167/iovs.14-16122 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the expansion of CTG18.1 allele associated with Fuchs' 
      corneal dystrophy (FCD) in our large cohort of late-onset FCD cases. METHODS: CTG 
      repeats within the CTG18.1 allele were estimated by short tandem repeat (STR) and 
      triplet primed PCR (TP-PCR) assays in our large cohort of 574 late-onset FCD 
      cases and 354 controls and large multigeneration familial cases. The age versus 
      severity relationships were analyzed in FCD genotypes, namely, nonexpanded (N/N), 
      monoallelic expansion (N/X), and biallelic expansion (X/X) with N </= 40 CTG 
      monomers. The threshold for causality conferred by an expansion of CTG18.1 was 
      identified by excluding the population of FCD cases who harbored an allele length 
      equivalent to the maximum CTG monomers observed in the controls. RESULTS: The 
      expanded CTG18.1 for (CTG)n>40 showed a strong association (P = 1.56 x 10(-82)) 
      with FCD. Importantly, we delineated the threshold of expansion to 103 CTG 
      repeats above which the allele confers causality in 17.8% of FCD cases. 
      Regression analyses demonstrated a significant correlation between disease 
      severity and age in individuals who harbor either a monoallelic expansion or a 
      biallelic expansion at (CTG) n > 40. These analyses helped predict FCD in two 
      previously unaffected individuals based on their CTG18.1 expansion genotype. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A monoallelic expansion of CTG18.1 contributes to increased disease 
      severity and is causal at (CTG)n>103, whereas a biallelic expansion is sufficient 
      to be causal for FCD at (CTG)n>40. This study highlights the largest contributory 
      causal allele for FCD.

TI  - TCF4 Triplet Repeat Expansion and Nuclear RNA Foci in Fuchs' Endothelial Corneal 
      Dystrophy.
PG  - 2003-11
LID - 10.1167/iovs.14-16222 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Expansion of the intronic CTG18.1 triplet repeat locus within TCF4 
      contributes significant risk to the development of Fuchs' endothelial corneal 
      dystrophy (FECD) in Eurasian populations, but the mechanisms by which the 
      expanded repeats result in degeneration of the endothelium have been hitherto 
      unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine FECD endothelial samples for 
      the presence of RNA nuclear foci, the hallmark of toxic RNA, as well as evidence 
      of haploinsufficiency of TCF4. METHODS: Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, 
      we examined for the presence of nuclear RNA foci containing expanded CUG 
      transcripts in corneal endothelial samples from FECD subjects with CTG18.1 
      expansion. We also examined for any changes in expression levels of TCF4 by 
      quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: Numerous discrete nuclear RNA foci were 
      identified in endothelial samples of FECD subjects (n = 8) harboring the CTG18.1 
      expansion, but not in controls lacking the expansion (n = 5) (P = 7.8 x 10(-4)). 
      Percentage of cells with foci in expansion-positive endothelial samples ranged 
      from 33% to 88%. RNA foci were absent in endothelial samples from an FECD subject 
      without CTG18.1 expansion and a subject with endothelial dysfunction without 
      FECD. Expression of the constitutive TCF4 exon encoding the basic 
      helix-loop-helix domain was unaltered with CTG18.1 expansion. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings suggest that the RNA nuclear foci are pathognomonic for CTG18.1 
      expansion-mediated endothelial disease. The RNA nuclear foci have been previously 
      found only in rare neurodegenerative disorders caused by repeat expansions. Our 
      detection of abundant ribonuclear foci in FECD implicates a role for toxic RNA in 
      this common disease.

AB  - Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is an inherited degenerative disease 
      that affects the internal endothelial cell monolayer of the cornea and can result 
      in corneal edema and vision loss in severe cases. FECD affects  approximately 5% of middle-aged 
      Caucasians in the United States and accounts for >14,000 corneal transplantations 
      annually. Among the several genes and loci associated with FECD, the strongest 
      association is with an intronic (CTG.CAG)n trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 
      TCF4 gene, which is found in the majority of affected patients. Corneal 
      endothelial cells from FECD patients harbor a poly(CUG)n RNA that can be 
      visualized as RNA foci containing this condensed RNA and associated proteins. 
      Similar to myotonic dystrophy type 1, the poly(CUG)n RNA co-localizes with and 
      sequesters the mRNA-splicing factor MBNL1, leading to missplicing of essential 
      MBNL1-regulated mRNAs. Such foci and missplicing are not observed in similar 
      cells from FECD patients who lack the repeat expansion. RNA-Seq splicing data 
      from the corneal endothelia of FECD patients and controls reveal hundreds of 
      differential alternative splicing events. These include events previously 
      characterized in the context of myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 
      epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, as well as splicing changes in genes 
      related to proposed mechanisms of FECD pathogenesis. We report the first instance 
      of RNA toxicity and missplicing in a common non-neurological/neuromuscular 
      disease associated with a repeat expansion. The FECD patient population with this 
      (CTG.CAG)n trinucleotide repeat expansion exceeds that of the combined number of 
      patients in all other microsatellite expansion disorders.

TI  - Transethnic replication of association of CTG18.1 repeat expansion of TCF4 gene 
      with Fuchs' corneal dystrophy in Chinese implies common causal variant.
PG  - 7073-8
LID - 10.1167/iovs.14-15390 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To test the association between the CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion of TCF4 gene and Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) in a 
      Chinese population. METHODS: The trinucleotide repeat polymorphism CTG18.1 was 
      genotyped using short tandem repeat and triplet repeat primed polymerase chain 
      reaction assays in 57 Chinese subjects with FECD and 121 controls. Statistical 
      association of the expanded CTG18.1 allele and 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs) across TCF4 with FECD was evaluated. To investigate the linkage 
      disequilibrium structure of the TCF4 region, haplotype analysis was performed on 
      our study subjects and compared with genotyping data of 97 Han Chinese and 85 
      Caucasians in the 1000 Genomes Project. RESULTS: The expanded CTG18.1 allele was 
      associated with FECD (P = 4.7 x 10(-14)), with the odds ratio of each copy of the 
      expanded allele estimated to be 66.5 (95% confidence interval: 12.6-350.1). Five 
      TCF4 SNPs showed association with FECD at a nominal level (P < 5.0 x 10(-2)); 
      however, conditional on the expanded CTG18.1 polymorphism, none of the SNPs 
      showed association with FECD. The only haplotype associated with the disease was 
      the one with the expansion at the CTG18.1 locus. CONCLUSIONS: Transethnic 
      replication of the association between the CTG18.1 repeat expansion in the TCF4 
      gene and FECD suggests it is a common, causal variant shared in Eurasian 
      populations conferring significant risk for the development of FECD. Our data 
      suggest that the expanded CTG18.1 allele is the main, if not sole, causal variant 
      at this gene locus in the Chinese population.

TI  - Comprehensive assessment of genetic variants within TCF4 in Fuchs' endothelial 
      corneal dystrophy.
PG  - 6101-7
LID - 10.1167/iovs.14-14958 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The single nucleotide variant (SNV), rs613872, in the transcription 
      factor 4 (TCF4) gene was previously found to be strongly associated (P = 6 x 
      10(-26)) with Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD). Subsequently, an 
      intronic expansion of the repeating trinucleotides, TGC, was found to be even 
      more predictive of disease. We performed comprehensive sequencing of the TCF4 
      gene region in order to identify the best marker for FECD within TCF4 and to 
      identify other novel variants that may be associated with FECD. METHODS: 
      Leukocyte DNA was isolated from 68 subjects with FECD and 16 unaffected 
      individuals. A custom capture panel was used to isolate the region surrounding 
      the two previously validated markers of FECD. Sequencing of the TCF4 coding 
      region, introns and flanking sequence, spanning 465 kb was performed at >1000x 
      average coverage using the Illumina HiSequation 2000. RESULTS: TGC expansion (>50 
      repeats) was present in 46 (68%) FECD-affected subjects and one (6%) normal 
      subject. A total of 1866 variants, including 1540 SNVs, were identified. Only two 
      previously reported SNVs resided in the TCF4 coding region, neither of which 
      segregated with disease. No variant, including TGC expansion, correlated 
      perfectly with disease status. Trinucleotide repeat expansion was a better 
      predictor of disease than any other variant. CONCLUSIONS: Complete sequencing of 
      the TCF4 genomic region revealed no single causative variant for FECD. The 
      intronic trinucleotide repeat expansion within TCF4 continues to be more strongly 
      associated with FECD than any other genetic variant.

TI  - Association and familial segregation of CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeat expansion of 
      TCF4 gene in Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy.
PG  - 33-42
LID - 10.1167/iovs.13-12611 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We tested the association between two intronic polymorphisms (CTG18.1 
      and rs613872) in TCF4 and Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), and 
      analyzed their segregation patterns in families. METHODS: We recruited 120 
      unrelated Caucasian subjects with FECD and 100 controls. Available family members 
      of probands were recruited. Genotyping of the single nucleotide polymorphism 
      (SNP) rs613872 was performed using Sanger sequencing or real-time allelic 
      discrimination assay. The trinucleotide repeat polymorphism, CTG18.1, was 
      genotyped using a combination of short tandem repeat assay and triplet repeat 
      primed PCR assay. The cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) repeat length of >/=40 was 
      classified as an expanded CTG18.1 allele. Association of the two loci with FECD 
      was evaluated. Segregation in 29 families was examined. RESULTS: The two 
      polymorphisms are in linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 0.65 in cases and 0.31 in 
      controls). Significant associations were found between FECD and rs613872 (P = 3.1 
      x 10(-17)), expanded CTG18.1 allele (P = 6.5 x 10(-25)), and their haplotypes (P 
      = 5.9 x 10(-19)). The odds ratio (OR) of each copy of the rs613872 G allele for 
      FECD was estimated to be 9.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.1-17.5). The OR of 
      each copy of the CTG18.1 expanded allele was estimated to be 32.3 (95% CI, 
      13.4-77.6). The expanded CTG 18.1 allele cosegregated with the trait in 52% 
      (15/29) of families with complete penetrance and 10% (3/29) with incomplete 
      penetrance. CONCLUSIONS: We report, to our knowledge, the first independent 
      replication of the expanded CTG 18.1 allele conferring significant risk for FECD 
      (>30-fold increase). The expanded allele cosegregates with the trait with 
      complete penetrance in a majority of families, but we also document cases of 
      incomplete penetrance.

AB  - Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a common, familial disease of the 
      corneal endothelium and is the leading indication for corneal transplantation. 
      Variation in the transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene has been identified as a 
      major contributor to the disease. We tested for an association between an 
      intronic TGC trinucleotide repeat in TCF4 and FECD by determining repeat length 
      in 66 affected participants with severe FECD and 63 participants with normal 
      corneas in a 3-stage discovery/replication/validation study. PCR primers flanking 
      the TGC repeat were used to amplify leukocyte-derived genomic DNA. Repeat length 
      was determined by direct sequencing, short tandem repeat (STR) assay and Southern 
      blotting. Genomic Southern blots were used to evaluate samples for which only a 
      single allele was identified by STR analysis. Compiling data for 3 arms of the 
      study, a TGC repeat length >50 was present in 79% of FECD cases and in 3% of 
      normal controls cases (p<0.001). Among cases, 52 of 66 (79%) subjects had >50 TGC 
      repeats, 13 (20%) had <40 repeats and 1 (2%) had an intermediate repeat length. 
      In comparison, only 2 of 63 (3%) unaffected control subjects had >50 repeats, 60 
      (95%) had <40 repeats and 1 (2%) had an intermediate repeat length. The repeat 
      length was greater than 1000 in 4 FECD cases. The sensitivity and specificity of 
      >50 TGC repeats identifying FECD in this patient cohort was 79% and 96%, 
      respectively Expanded TGC repeat was more specific for FECD cases than the 
      previously identified, highly associated, single nucleotide polymorphism, 
      rs613872 (specificity = 79%). The TGC trinucleotide repeat expansion in TCF4 is 
      strongly associated with FECD, and a repeat length >50 is highly specific for the 
      disease This association suggests that trinucleotide expansion may play a 
      pathogenic role in the majority of FECD cases and is a predictor of disease risk.

AB  - In this study, the coding region of type O FMDV capsid protein VP1 and a series 
      of codon optimized DNA sequences coding for VP1 amino acid residues 141-160 
      (epitope1), tandem repeat 200-213 (epitope2 (+2)) and the combination of two 
      epitopes (epitope1-2) was genetically cloned into the prokaryotic expression 
      vector pP(RO)ExHTb and pGEX4T-1, respectively. VP1 and the fused epitopes GST-E1, 
      GST-E2 (+2) and GST-E1-2 were successfully solubly expressed in the cytoplasm of 
      Escherichia coli and Western blot analysis demonstrated they retained 
      antigenicity. Indirect VP1-ELISA and epitope ELISAs were subsequently developed 
      to screen a panel of 80 field pig sera using LPB-ELISA as a standard test. For 
      VP1-ELISA and all the epitope ELISAs, there were clear distinctions between the 
      FMDV-positive and the FMDV-negative samples. Cross-reactions with pig sera 
      positive to the viruses of swine vesicular disease virus that produce clinically 
      indistinguishable syndromes in pigs or guinea pig antisera to FMDV strains of 
      type A, C and Asia1 did not occur. The relative sensitivity and specificity for 
      the GST-E1 ELISA, GST-E2 (+2), GST-E1-2 ELISA and VP1-ELISA in comparison with 
      LPB-ELISA were 93.3% and 85.0%, 95.0% and 90%, 100% and 81.8%, 96.6% and 80.9% 
      respectively. This study shows the potential use of the aforementioned epitopes 
      as alternatives to the complex antigens used in current detection for antibody to 
      FMDV structural proteins.

TI  - Association and linkage studies between bipolar affective disorder and the 
      polymorphic CAG/CTG repeat loci ERDA1, SEF2-1B, MAB21L and KCNN3.
PG  - 565-9
AB  - Several reports have suggested the presence of anticipation in bipolar affective 
      disorder (BPAD). In addition, independent studies using the RED (repeat expansion 
      detection) have shown association between BPAD and longer CAG/CTG repeats. 
      Therefore loci with large CAG/CTG repeats are plausible candidates in the 
      inheritance of BPAD. The present study assesses the length of the repeats in four 
      loci: the ERDA-1 locus which is known to account for most of the long CAG repeats 
      detected by RED, the SEF2-1b locus which is placed in a region where positive 
      linkage results have been reported and the loci MAB21L and KCNN3 as functional 
      candidate genes. A Brazilian case-control sample with 115 unrelated BPAD patients 
      and 196 healthy control subjects and 14 multiply affected bipolar families was 
      investigated. With the case-control design the distribution of alleles between 
      the two groups did not approach statistical significance. The extended 
      transmission disequilibrium test (ETDT) performed in our families did not show 
      evidence for linkage disequilibrium. Parametric and non-parametric linkage 
      analysis also did not provide support for linkage between any of the four loci 
      and BPAD. Our data do not support the hypothesis that variation at the 
      polymorphic CAG/CTG repeat loci ERDA-1, SEF2-1b, MAB21L or KCNN3 influence 
      susceptibility to BPAD in our sample.

TI  - An unstable trinucleotide-repeat region on chromosome 13 implicated in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia: a common expansion locus.
PG  - 819-29
AB  - Larger CAG/CTG trinucleotide-repeat tracts in individuals affected with 
      schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) in comparison with 
      control individuals have previously been reported, implying a possible 
      etiological role for trinucleotide repeats in these diseases. Two unstable 
      CAG/CTG repeats, SEF2-1B and ERDA1, have recently been cloned, and studies 
      indicate that the majority of individuals with large repeats as detected by 
      repeat-expansion detection (RED) have large repeat alleles at these loci. These 
      repeats do not show association of large alleles with either BPAD or SCZ. Using 
      RED, we have identified a BPAD individual with a very large CAG/CTG repeat that 
      is not due to expansion at SEF2-1B or ERDA1. From this individual's DNA, we have 
      cloned a highly polymorphic trinucleotide repeat consisting of (CTA)n (CTG)n, 
      which is very long ( approximately 1,800 bp) in this patient. The repeat region 
      localizes to chromosome 13q21, within 1.2 cM of fragile site FRA13C. Repeat 
      alleles in our sample were unstable in 13 (5.6%) of 231 meioses. Large alleles 
      (>100 repeats) were observed in 14 (1. 25%) of 1,120 patients with psychosis, 
      borderline personality disorder, or juvenile-onset depression and in 5 (.7%) of 
      710 healthy controls. Very large alleles were also detected for Centre d'Etude 
      Polymorphisme Humaine (CEPH) reference family 1334. This triplet expansion has 
      recently been reported to be the cause of spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8); 
      however, none of our large alleles above the disease threshold occurred in 
      individuals either affected by SCA or with known family history of SCA. The high 
      frequency of large alleles at this locus is inconsistent with the much rarer 
      occurrence of SCA8. Thus, it seems unlikely that expansion alone causes SCA8; 
      other genetic mechanisms may be necessary to explain SCA8 etiology.

TI  - Analysis of genome-wide CAG/CTG repeats, and at SEF2-1B and ERDA1 in 
      schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder.
PG  - 229-34
AB  - A shift towards larger CAG/CTG triplet repeats and schizophrenia (SCZ) and 
      bipolar affective disorder (BPAD) has been detected by several recent studies, 
      using the Repeat Expansion Detection (RED) technique, however no specific loci 
      have been shown to be responsible for this shift. Further analyses by our group 
      of RED (CTG)10 ligation products amongst an extended sample of patients and 
      comparison with controls matched for age, sex and ethnicity show no significant 
      differences in distribution (P= 0.23, n=95; P=0.93, n=91, for SCZ and BPAD 
      respectively). Alleles at two recently discovered unstable trinucleotide repeat 
      loci at 18q21.1 (SEF2-1B) and 17q21.3 (ERDA1) have also been analysed in 
      affecteds and matched controls. We observed no increase in frequency of larger 
      alleles (>37 repeats) in affected individuals at SEF2-1B (BPAD: P=0.95, n= 100; 
      SCZ: P=0.61, n=97) or at ERDA1 (BPAD: P= 0.4, n = 101; SCZ: P= 0.05, n = 151, 
      with larger alleles more frequent in controls). Our findings suggest that larger 
      CAG/CTG repeats at these loci are neither major contributory factors to the 
      etiology of psychosis, nor in linkage disequilibrium with a gene that is. 
      Furthermore, when the RED results were compared to allele sizes at SEF2-1B and 
      ERDA1, it was observed that a majority of SCZ, BPAD and control individuals with 
      large RED products had a large allele at either or both sites (78% for RED 
      products > or =270 bp; 62% for RED products > or =180 bp).
