TI  - Different outcomes of endurance and resistance exercise in skeletal muscles of 
      Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exercise is widely considered to have beneficial impact on skeletal 
      muscle aging. In addition, there are also several studies demonstrating a 
      positive effect of exercise on muscular dystrophies. Oculopharyngeal muscular 
      dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset autosomal dominant inherited neuromuscular 
      disorder caused by mutations in the PAPBN1 gene. These mutations consist in short 
      (1-8) and meiotically stable GCN trinucleotide repeat expansions in its coding 
      region responsible for the formation of PAPBN1 intranuclear aggregates. This 
      study aims to characterize the effects of two types of chronic exercise, 
      resistance and endurance, on the OPMD skeletal muscle phenotype using a relevant 
      murine model of OPMD. METHODS: In this study, we tested two protocols of 
      exercise. In the first, based on endurance exercise, FvB (wild-type) and A17 
      (OPMD) mice underwent a 6-week-long motorized treadmill protocol consisting in 
      three sessions per week of running 20 cm/s for 20 min. In the second protocol, 
      based on resistance exercise generated by chronic mechanical overload (OVL), 
      surgical removal of gastrocnemius and soleus muscles was performed, inducing 
      hypertrophy of the plantaris muscle. In both types of exercise, muscles of A17 
      and FvB mice were compared with those of respective sedentary mice. For all the 
      groups, force measurement, muscle histology, and molecular analyses were 
      conducted. RESULTS: Following the endurance exercise protocol, we did not observe 
      any major changes in the muscle physiological parameters, but an increase in the 
      number of PABPN1 intranuclear aggregates in both tibialis anterior (+24%, 
      **P = 0.0026) and gastrocnemius (+18%, ****P < 0.0001) as well as enhanced 
      collagen deposition (+20%, **P = 0.0064 in the tibialis anterior; +35%, 
      **P = 0.0042 in the gastrocnemius) in the exercised A17 OPMD mice. In the 
      supraphysiological resistance overload protocol, we also observed an increased 
      collagen deposition (x2, ****P < 0.0001) in the plantaris muscle of A17 OPMD mice 
      which was associated with larger muscle mass (x2, ****P < 0.0001) and fibre cross 
      sectional area (x2, ***P = 0.0007) and increased absolute maximal force (x2, 
      ****P < 0.0001) as well as a reduction in PABPN1 aggregate number (-16%, 
      ****P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Running exercise and mechanical overload led to 
      very different outcome in skeletal muscles of A17 mice. Both types of exercise 
      enhanced collagen deposition but while the running protocol increased aggregates, 
      the OVL reduced them. More importantly OVL reversed muscle atrophy and maximal 
      force in the A17 mice. Our study performed in a relevant model gives an 
      indication of the effect of different types of exercise on OPMD muscle which 
      should be further evaluated in humans for future recommendations as a part of the 
      lifestyle of individuals with OPMD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a rare 
      progressive neuromuscular disease. MRI is one of the techniques that is used in 
      neuromuscular disorders to evaluate muscle alterations. The aim of this study was 
      to describe the pattern of fatty infiltration of orofacial and leg muscles using 
      quantitative muscle MRI in a large national cohort and to determine whether MRI 
      can be used as an imaging biomarker of disease progression in OPMD. METHODS: 
      Patients with OPMD (18 years or older) were invited from the national 
      neuromuscular database or by their treating physicians and were examined twice 
      with an interval of 20 months, with quantitative MRI of orofacial and leg muscles 
      to assess fatty infiltration which were compared with clinical measures. RESULTS: 
      In 43 patients with genetically confirmed OPMD, the muscles that were affected 
      most severely were the tongue (mean fat fraction: 37.0%, SD 16.6), adductor 
      magnus (31.9%; 27.1), and soleus (27.9%; 21.5) muscles. The rectus femoris and 
      tibialis anterior muscles were least severely affected (mean fat fractions: 6.8%; 
      SD 4.7, 7.5%; 5.9). Eleven of 14 significant correlations were found between fat 
      fraction and a clinical task in the corresponding muscles (r = -0.312 to -0.769, 
      CI = -0.874 to -0.005). At follow-up, fat fractions had increased significantly 
      in 17 of the 26 muscles: mean 1.7% in the upper leg muscles (CI = 0.8-2.4), 1.7% 
      (1.0-2.3) in the lower leg muscles, and 1.9% (0.6-3.3) in the orofacial muscles 
      (p < 0.05). The largest increase was seen for the soleus (3.8%, CI = 2.5-5.1). 
      Correlations were found between disease duration and repeat length vs increased 
      fat fraction in 7 leg muscles (r = 0.323 to -0.412, p < 0.05). DISCUSSION: 
      According to quantitative muscle MRI, the tongue, adductor magnus and soleus show 
      the largest fat infiltration levels in patients with OPMD. Fat fractions 
      increased in several orofacial and leg muscles over 20 months, with the largest 
      fat fraction increase seen in the soleus. This study supports that this technique 
      is sensitive enough to show worsening in fat fractions of orofacial and leg 
      muscles and therefore a responsive biomarker for future clinical trials.

      binding efficacy with d(CGG)(15) quadruplex is investigated. Circular dichroism 
      (CD) wavelength scan titration experiments of RuS and RuSe compounds with the 
      intermolecular parallel quadruplex formed by d(CGG)(15) (associated with 
      neurodegenerative/neuromuscular/neuronal intranuclear inclusion disorders like 
      FXTAS, OPMD, OPDM types 1-4, and OPML as well as FXPOI) and with the control 
      d(CGG)(15).d(CCG)(15) duplex indicate their specificity toward the former. 
      Electrophoretic mobility shift titration experiments also confirm the binding of 
      the ligands with d(CGG)(15). CD thermal denaturation experiments indicate that 
      both RuS and RuSe destabilize the quadruplex, specifically at 10 mM concentration 
      of the ligands. This is further confirmed by 1D (1)H NMR experiments. Such a 
      destabilizing effect of these ligands on the d(CGG)(15) quadruplex indicates that 
      RuS and RuSe chalcogen complexes can act as a template for the design of novel 
      molecules for the diagnostics and/or therapeutics of CGG repeat 
      expansion-associated diseases.

      heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q (HNRNPQ)/SYNCRIP is required to 
      stimulate early events in autophagosome biogenesis, in particular the induction 
      of VPS34 kinase by ULK1-mediated beclin 1 phosphorylation. The RBPs HNRNPQ and 
      poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) form a regulatory network that 
      controls the turnover of distinct autophagy-related (ATG) proteins. We also show 
      that oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) mutations engender a switch from 
      autophagosome stimulation to autophagosome inhibition by impairing PABPN1 and 
      HNRNPQ control of the level of ULK1. The overexpression of HNRNPQ in OPMD 
      patient-derived cells rescues the defective autophagy in these cells. Our data 
      reveal a regulatory mechanism of autophagy induction that is compromised by 
      PABPN1 disease mutations, and may thus further contribute to their deleterious 
      effects.

AB  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset myopathic genetic 
      disorder characterized by chronic progressive dysphagia and ptosis with or 
      without proximal limb weakness. It is most often caused by an abnormal 
      alanine-encoding (GCN) trinucleotide repeat expansion in the first exon of the 
      poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene. Patients with hypothyroidism may 
      similarly report bilateral ptosis, dysphagia, and limb weakness. Here, we report 
      the case of a 65-year-old Austrian female with hypothyroidism living in the 
      Philippines who presented with gradually progressive ptosis, dysphagia, and 
      intermittent choking episodes. No known relatives had similar symptoms. Physical 
      examination showed bilateral symmetric ptosis, good cough reflex, and good limb 
      muscle strength. Electromyographic studies of facial and laryngeal muscles were 
      found to be normal. Thyroid evaluation showed biochemically hyperthyroid status 
      while taking Levothyroxine. With a clinical suspicion for genetic progressive 
      myopathy, we considered OPMD. Genetic testing revealed abnormal expansion of GCN 
      trinucleotide repeats in the PABPN1 gene. We describe the first reported case of 
      OPMD with detected PABPN1 gene expansion in the Philippines simulating 
      hypothyroidism symptoms, suggesting possible points for misidentification and 
      underdiagnosis of OPMD in developing countries.

TI  - Frequency and type of cancers in myotonic dystrophy: A retrospective 
      cross-sectional study.
PG  - 142-148
LID - 10.1002/mus.27801 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Myotonic dystrophies (DMs) are autosomal dominant diseases in 
      which expression of a mutant expanded repeat mRNA leads to abnormal splicing of 
      downstream effector genes thought to be responsible for their multisystem 
      involvement. Cancer risk and cancer-related deaths are increased in DM patients 
      relative to the general population. We aimed at determining the frequency and 
      type of cancers in both DM1 and DM2 vs a non-DM muscular dystrophy cohort. 
      METHODS: A retrospective, cross-sectional study was carried out on patients with 
      genetically confirmed DM1, DM2, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), 
      and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) at our institutions from 2000 to 
      2020. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-five DM1, 67 DM2, 187 FSHD, and 109 OPMD 
      patients were included. Relative to non-DM, DM patients had an increased cancer 
      risk that was independent of age and sex. Specifically, an increased risk of 
      sex-related (ovarian) and non-sex-related (non-melanoma skin, urological, and 
      hematological) cancers was observed in DM1 and DM2, respectively. The length of 
      CTG repeat expansion was not associated with cancer occurrence in the DM1 group. 
      DISCUSSION: In addition to current consensus-based care recommendations, our 
      findings prompt consideration of screening for skin, urological, and 
      hematological cancers in DM2 patients, and screening of ovarian malignancies in 
      DM1 female patients.

TI  - Muscle ultrasound is a sensitive biomarker in oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy.
PG  - 453-461
LID - 10.1002/mus.27679 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset, 
      progressive muscle disease. Quantitative muscle ultrasound (QMUS) assesses 
      structural changes in muscles and is a sensitive biomarker in neuromuscular 
      disorders. Our aim of this study was to determine whether QMUS can detect muscle 
      pathology and can be used as longitudinal imaging biomarker in OPMD. METHODS: 
      Genetically confirmed OPMD patients, recruited by their treating physicians or 
      from the national neuromuscular database, were examined twice, 20 months apart, 
      using QMUS of orofacial and limb muscles, and measurements of functional capacity 
      and muscle strength. Absolute echo intensity (AEI) and muscle thickness of all 
      muscles were analyzed and correlated with clinical data. RESULTS: The tongue, 
      deltoid, iliopsoas, rectus femoris, and soleus muscles showed increased AEI at 
      baseline compared with normal values in 43 OPMD patients, with the rectus femoris 
      being most often affected (51%).The AEI and muscle thickness of 9 of 11 muscles 
      correlated significantly with the motor function measure, 10-step stair test, 
      swallowing capacity, dynamometry, Medical Research Council grade, tongue 
      strength, and bite force (r = 0.302 to -0.711). Between baseline and follow-up, 
      deterioration in AEI was found for the temporalis, tongue, and deltoid muscles, 
      and decreased muscle thickness was detected for the temporalis, masseter, 
      digastric, tongue, deltoid, iliopsoas, and soleus muscles (P < .05). No relation 
      was found between the change in AEI and repeat length or disease duration. 
      DISCUSSION: QMUS detected muscle pathology and disease progression in OPMD over 
      20 months. We conclude that QMUS should be considered as a biomarker in treatment 
      trials.

TI  - Intranuclear inclusions in skin biopsies are not limited to neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusion disease but can also be seen in oculopharyngodistal myopathy.
PG  - e12787
LID - 10.1111/nan.12787 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is caused by the expansion of CGG 
      repeats in NOTCH2NLC (OPDM_NOTCH2NLC) GIPC1 (OPDM_GIPC1), or LRP12 (OPDM_LRP12). 
      Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is clinically distinct from OPDM 
      but is also caused by the expansion of CGG repeats in NOTCH2NLC, which may be an 
      indicator of intranuclear inclusion in skin biopsy. We investigated the presence 
      of intranuclear inclusions in skin biopsies from patients with OPDM and muscle 
      diseases with a similar pathology to evaluate whether they will have similar 
      diagnostic findings on skin biopsy. METHODS: We analysed the frequency of 
      p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in sweat gland cells, adipocytes and 
      fibroblasts in skin biopsy samples from patients with OPDM (OPDM_NOTCH2NLC 
      [n = 2], OPDM_GIPC1 [n = 6] and OPDM_LRP12 [n = 3]), NIID (n = 1), OPMD (n = 1), 
      IBM (n = 4) and GNE myopathy (n = 2). RESULTS: The p62-postive intranuclear 
      inclusions were observed in all three cell types in both patients with 
      OPDM_NOTCH2NLC and a patient with NIID, in at least one cell type in all six 
      patients with OPDM_GIPC1, and all in three cell types in one of the three 
      patients with OPDM_LRP12. These findings were not observed in patients with OPMD, 
      IBM or GNE myopathy. CONCLUSION: Intranuclear inclusions in skin biopsy samples 
      are not specific to NIID and are found in all three types of genetically 
      confirmed OPDM, suggesting that the underlying mechanism of OPDM may be similar 
      to NIID, regardless of causative genes.

TI  - A Japanese case of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) with PABPN1 
      c.35G > C; p.Gly12Ala point mutation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset muscular 
      dystrophy characterised by slowly progressive ptosis, dysphagia, and proximal 
      limb muscle weakness. A common cause of OPMD is the short expansion of a GCG or 
      GCA trinucleotide repeat in PABPN1 gene. CASE PRESENTATION: A 78-year-old woman 
      presented with ptosis and gradually progressive dysphagia. Her son had the same 
      symptoms. A physical examination and muscle imaging (MRI and ultrasound) showed 
      impairment of the tongue, proximal muscles of the upper limbs, and flexor muscles 
      of the lower limbs. Needle-electromyography (EMG) of bulbar and facial muscles 
      revealed a myopathic pattern. Based on the characteristic muscle involvement 
      pattern and needle-EMG findings, we suspected that the patient had OPMD. Gene 
      analysis revealed PABPN1 c.35G > C point mutation, which mimicked the effect of a 
      common causative repeat expansion mutation of OPMD. CONCLUSION: We herein 
      describe the first reported Japanese case of OPMD with PABPN1 point mutation, 
      suggesting that this mutation is causative in Asians as well as in Europeans, in 
      whom it was originally reported.

TI  - Clinicopathologic Features of Oculopharyngodistal Myopathy With LRP12 CGG Repeat 
      Expansions Compared With Other Oculopharyngodistal Myopathy Subtypes.
PG  - 853-863
LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2021.1509 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Repeat expansion of CGG in LRP12 has been identified as the causative 
      variation of oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM). However, to our knowledge, the 
      clinicopathologic features of OPDM with CGG repeat expansion in LRP12 (hereafter 
      referred to as OPDM_LRP12) remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: To identify and 
      characterize the clinicopathologic features of patients with OPDM_LRP12. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case series included 208 patients with a clinical 
      or clinicopathologic diagnosis of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPDM) from 
      January 1, 1978, to December 31, 2020. Patients with GCN repeat expansions in 
      PABPN1 were excluded from the study. Repeat expansions of CGG in LRP12 were 
      screened by repeat primed polymerase chain reaction and/or Southern blot. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical information, muscle imaging data obtained by 
      either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, and muscle pathologic 
      characteristics. RESULTS: Sixty-five Japanese patients with OPDM (40 men [62%]; 
      mean [SD] age at onset, 41.0 [10.1] years) from 59 families with CGG repeat 
      expansions in LRP12 were identified. This represents the most common OPDM subtype 
      among all patients in Japan with genetically diagnosed OPDM. The expansions 
      ranged from 85 to 289 repeats. A negative correlation was observed between the 
      repeat size and the age at onset (r2 = 0.188, P = .001). The most common initial 
      symptoms were ptosis and muscle weakness, present in 24 patients (37%). Limb 
      muscle weakness was predominantly distal in 53 of 64 patients (83%), but 2 of 64 
      patients (3%) had predominantly proximal muscle weakness. Ptosis was observed in 
      62 of 64 patients (97%), and dysphagia or dysarthria was observed in 63 of 64 
      patients (98%). A total of 21 of 64 patients (33%) had asymmetric muscle 
      weakness. Aspiration pneumonia was seen in 11 of 64 patients (17%), and 5 of 64 
      patients (8%) required mechanical ventilation. Seven of 64 patients (11%) 
      developed cardiac abnormalities, and 5 of 64 patients (8%) developed neurologic 
      abnormalities. Asymmetric muscle involvement was detected on computed tomography 
      scans in 6 of 27 patients (22%) and on magnetic resonance imaging scans in 4 of 
      15 patients (27%), with the soleus and the medial head of the gastrocnemius being 
      the worst affected. All 42 muscle biopsy samples showed rimmed vacuoles. 
      Intranuclear tubulofilamentous inclusions were observed in only 1 of 5 patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that OPDM_LRP12 is the most 
      frequent OPDM subtype in Japan and is characterized by oculopharyngeal weakness, 
      distal myopathy that especially affects the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, and 
      rimmed vacuoles in muscle biopsy.

AB  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a rare autosomal dominant late-onset 
      muscular dystrophy affecting approximately 1:100 000 individuals in Europe. OPMD 
      is mainly characterized by progressive eyelid drooping (ptosis) and dysphagia 
      although muscles of the limbs can also be affected late in life. This muscle 
      disease is due to a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the polyA-binding protein 
      nuclear-1 gene. Patients express a protein with an 11-18 alanine tract that is 
      misfolded and prone to form intranuclear inclusions, which are the hallmark of 
      the disease. Other features of OPMD include muscle fibrosis and atrophy in 
      affected muscles. Currently, no pharmacological treatments are available, and 
      OPMD patients can only be referred to surgeons for cricopharyngeal myotomy or 
      corrective surgery of extraocular muscles to ease ptosis. We recently tested a 
      two-AAV ;silence' and ;replace' vector-based gene therapy treatment in a mouse 
      model of OPMD. We demonstrate here that this gene therapy approach can revert 
      already established insoluble aggregates and partially rescues the muscle from 
      atrophy, which are both crucially important since in most cases OPMD patients 
      already have an established disease when diagnosed. This strategy also prevents 
      the formation of muscle fibrosis and stabilizes the muscle strength to the level 
      of healthy muscles. Furthermore, we show here that similar results can be 
      obtained using a single AAV vector incorporating both the ;silence' and ;replace' 
      cassettes. These results further support the application of a gene therapy 
      approach as a novel treatment for OPMD in humans.

AB  - Short tandem repeats (STRs) are scattered throughout the human genome. Some STRs, 
      like trinucleotide repeat expansion (TRE) variants, cause hereditable disorders. 
      Unambiguous molecular diagnostics of TRE disorders is hampered by current 
      technical limitations imposed by traditional PCR and DNA sequencing methods. Here 
      we report a novel pipeline for TRE variant diagnosis employing the massively 
      parallel sequencing (MPS) combined with an opensource software package 
      (FDSTools), which together are designed to distinguish true STR sequences from 
      STR sequencing artifacts. We show that this approach can improve TRE diagnosis, 
      such as Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). OPMD is caused by a 
      trinucleotide expansion in the PABPN1 gene. A short GCN expansion, (GCN[10]), 
      coding for a 10 alanine repeat is not pathogenic, but an alanine expansion is 
      pathogenic. Applying this novel procedure in  a Dutch OPMD patient cohort, we 
      found expansion variants from GCN[11] to GCN[16], with the GCN[16] as the most 
      abundant variant. The repeat expansion length did not correlate with clinical 
      features. However, symptom severity was found to correlate with age and with the 
      initial affected muscles, suggesting that aging and muscle-specific factors 
      can play a role in modulating OPMD.

LID - 14848
AB  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an autosomal dominant, late-onset 
      muscle disorder characterized by ptosis, swallowing difficulties, proximal limb 
      weakness and nuclear aggregates in skeletal muscles. OPMD is caused by a 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in the PABPN1 gene that results in an N-terminal 
      expanded polyalanine tract in polyA-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1). Here we 
      show that the treatment of a mouse model of OPMD with an adeno-associated 
      virus-based gene therapy combining complete knockdown of endogenous PABPN1 and 
      its replacement by a wild-type PABPN1 substantially reduces the amount of 
      insoluble aggregates, decreases muscle fibrosis, reverts muscle strength to the 
      level of healthy muscles and normalizes the muscle transcriptome. The efficacy of 
      the combined treatment is further confirmed in cells derived from OPMD patients. 
      These results pave the way towards a gene replacement approach for OPMD 
      treatment.

TI  - Characterization of PABPN1 expansion mutations in a large cohort of Mexican 
      patients with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD).

AB  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an autosomal-dominant, adult-onset 
      disorder defined by blepharoptosis, dysphagia, and proximal muscle weakness. OPMD 
      arises from heterozygous expansions of a trinucleotide (GCN) tract situated at 
      the 5' region of the polyadenylate RNA binding protein 1 (PABPN1) gene. The 
      frequency of a particular (GCN) expansion in a given population of patients with 
      OPMD is largely influenced by the occurrence of founder mutations. Analysis of 
      large groups of patients with OPMD from different ethnic origins will help to 
      estimate the relative contribution of each expanded allele to the disease. The 
      purpose of this study was to characterize the type of PABPN1 expanded alleles in 
      a large cohort of OPMD individuals from Mexico. Molecular analysis procedures 
      included genomic DNA extraction from blood leukocytes in each patient followed by 
      PCR amplification of PABPN1 exon 1, and direct nucleotide sequencing of PCR 
      products. A total of 102 patients with OPMD were included in the study. Expanded 
      PABPN1 gene alleles were demonstrated in all patients: 65% (66 out of 102) had a 
      (GCN)15 expansion while the remaining 35% (36 out of 102) exhibited a (GCN)13 
      expansion. This is one of the largest series of molecularly confirmed patients 
      with OPMD in a non-Caucasian population. Ethnic-specific differences in the 
      prevalence of specific PABPN1 expansions must be considered for genetic screening 
      of patients with OPMD.

TI  - A South African family with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy: Clinical and 
      molecular genetic characteristics.
PG  - 540-3
LID - 10.7196/SAMJnew.7880 [doi]
AB  - Autosomal dominantly inherited oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is 
      caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in exon 1 of the polyadenylate binding 
      protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene on chromosome 14q. A large family with OPMD was 
      recently identified in Pretoria, South Africa (SA). Molecular studies revealed a 
      (GCG)11(GCA)3GCG or (GCN)15 mutant allele. The (GCN)15 mutation detected in this 
      family has been described previously in families from Uruguay and Mexico as a 
      founder effect. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an SA Afrikaner 
      family with molecularly confirmed OPMD. The proband, a 64-year-old woman, 
      presented to the neurology outpatient department at Steve Biko Academic Hospital, 
      Pretoria. A sibship of 18 individuals was identified, of whom eight had OPMD. 
      Four patients were interviewed and examined clinically, and electromyographic 
      studies were performed. Molecular analysis of the PABPN1 gene was performed by 
      polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing of exon 1 in three 
      of the patients. Patients presented with ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, 
      dysphagia, dysarthria and mild proximal weakness. High foot arches and absent 
      ankle reflexes raised the possibility of peripheral neuropathy, but

TI  - A decline in PABPN1 induces progressive muscle weakness in oculopharyngeal muscle 
      dystrophy and in muscle aging.
PG  - 412-26
AB  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is caused by trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion mutations in Poly(A) binding protein 1 (PABPN1). PABPN1 is a regulator 
      of mRNA stability and is ubiquitously expressed. Here we investigated how 
      symptoms in OPMD initiate only at midlife and why a subset of skeletal muscles is 
      predominantly affected. Genome-wide RNA expression profiles from Vastus lateralis 
      muscles human carriers of expanded-PABPN1 at pre-symptomatic and symptomatic 
      stages were compared with healthy controls. Major expression changes were found 
      to be associated with age rather than with expression of expanded-PABPN1, instead 
      transcriptomes of OPMD and elderly muscles were significantly similar (P<0.05). 
      Using k-means clustering we identified age-dependent trends in both OPMD and 
      controls, but trends were often accelerated in OPMD. We report an age-regulated 
      decline in PABPN1 levels in Vastus lateralis muscles from the fifth decade. In 
      concurrence with severe muscle degeneration in OPMD, the decline in PABPN1 
      accelerated in OPMD and was specific to skeletal muscles. Reduced PABPN1 levels 
      (30% to 60%) in muscle cells induced myogenic defects and morphological 
      signatures of cellular aging in proportion to PABPN1 expression levels. We 
      suggest that PABPN1 levels regulate muscle cell aging and OPMD represents an 
      accelerated muscle aging disorder.

TI  - Atrophy, fibrosis, and increased PAX7-positive cells in pharyngeal muscles of 
      oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy patients.
PG  - 234-43

AB  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset autosomal dominant 
      inherited dystrophy caused by an abnormal trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 
      poly(A)-binding-protein-nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene. Primary muscular targets of OPMD 
      are the eyelid elevator and pharyngeal muscles, including the cricopharyngeal 
      muscle (CPM), the progressive involution of which leads to ptosis and dysphagia, 
      respectively. To understand the consequences of PABPN1 polyalanine expansion in 
      OPMD, we studied muscle biopsies from 14 OPMD patients, 3 inclusion body myositis 
      patients, and 9 healthy controls. In OPMD patient CPM (n = 6), there were typical 
      dystrophic features with extensive endomysial fibrosis and marked atrophy of 
      myosin heavy-chain IIa fibers. There were more PAX7-positive cells in all CPM 
      versus other muscles (n = 5, control; n = 3, inclusion body myositis), and they 
      were more numerous in OPMD CPM versus control normal CPM without any sign of 
      muscle regeneration. Intranuclear inclusions were present in all OPMD muscles but 
      unaffected OPMD patient muscles (i.e. sternocleidomastoid, quadriceps, or 
      deltoid; n = 14) did not show evidence of fibrosis, atrophy, or increased 
      PAX7-positive cell numbers. These results suggest that the specific involvement 
      of CPM in OPMD might be caused by failure of the regenerative response with 
      dysfunction of PAX7-positive cells and exacerbated fibrosis that does not 
      correlate with the presence of PABPN1 inclusions.

TI  - Expression of the polyalanine expansion mutant of nuclear poly(A)-binding protein 
      induces apoptosis via the p53 pathway.
PG  - 697-704
LID - 10.1042/CBI20110348 [doi]
AB  - The PABPN1 [nuclear poly(A)-binding protein 1] is ubiquitous, binds to the 
      nascent mRNA transcript and controls the poly(A) tract elongation process in 
      multicellular organisms. Expansion of GCG repeats that encode first 6 of the 10 
      alanine residues of a polyalanine tract at the N-terminus of wild-type PABPN1 to 
      12-17 alanine residues causes aggregation of the protein and cell death. Patients 
      with the adult onset autosomal dominant OPMD (oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy) 
      carry the GCG expansion mutation in their PABPN1 gene. The symptoms of OPMD 
      include drooping eye lids and difficulty swallowing. The severity of symptoms 
      increases with the length of the expansion. We have investigated the mechanism of 
      cell death in HeLa and HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cultured cells expressing 
      the mutant PABPN1 with a polyalanine tract containing 17 alanine residues 
      (PABPN1-A17). In cells expressing PABPN1-A17, the abundance of pro-apoptotic 
      proteins, p53, PUMA (p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis) and Noxa, are 
      up-regulated. This was associated with the redistribution of p53 to the nucleus 
      and mitochondria. Concomitantly Bax was translocated to the mitochondria, 
      followed by the release of cytochrome c and the cleavage of caspase 3. 
      Furthermore, blocking p53-mediated transcription using pifithrin significantly 
      reduced apoptosis. Our findings suggest a key role of p53-mediated apoptosis in 
      death of cells expressing the polyalanine expansion mutant of PABPN1.

TI  - Two cases of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) with the rare PABPN1 
      c.35G>C; p.Gly12Ala point mutation.
PG  - 809-11
LID - 10.1016/j.nmd.2011.06.003 [doi]
AB  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy is a neuromuscular disease usually presenting 
      in the 5th or 6th decades of life with a dominant inheritance pattern. In almost 
      all cases the cause of the disease is the expansion of a DNA repeat sequence 
      containing GCG and GCA codons in exon 1 of the PABPN1 gene from 10 to between 12 
      and 17 repeats. However one case has been previously reported without the gene 
      expansion but instead with a c.35G>C missense mutation converting a glycine codon 
      to an alanine and resulting in a sequence of 13 contiguous alanine codons, thus 
      mimicking the effect of the common expansion mutation. Here we report two further 
      cases of OPMD caused by the c.35G>C point mutation. Clinical and pedigree data 
      indicate the usual OPMD dominant inheritance pattern.

TI  - A GCG expansion (GCG)(1)(1) in polyadenylate-binding protein nuclear 1 gene caused 
      oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy in a Chinese family.
PG  - 1350-4
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the mutation in polyadenylate-binding protein nuclear 1 gene 
      (PABPN1, previously termed PABP2) in a Chinese family with autosomal, dominantly 
      inherited oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). METHODS: Clinical and 
      ophthalmologic examinations were conducted on available living family members 
      from three generations. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood 
      leukocytes of every available family member, and the fragment flanking the 
      (GCG)(n) of the PABPN1 gene was amplified by PCR. Mutations were screened by DNA 
      sequencing. Photographs of deceased family members were examined for signs of 
      OPMD. RESULTS: Clinical features of OPMD were found in all patients in generation 
      II except the youngest sister, and no clinical manifestations were found in 
      generation III. Mutation sequencing demonstrated that (GCG)(6) in the wild PABPN1 
      gene was expanded to heterozygous (GCG)(1)(1) in all affected family members and in 
      some but not all unaffected members. CONCLUSIONS: In a Chinese family with 
      autosomal dominantly inherited OPMD, a heterozygous (GCG)(1)(1) expansion was 
      identified in all affected family members and in several young unaffected 
      members.

TI  - Delayed diagnosis of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy in Scotland.
PG  - 281-3
LID - 10.1136/bjo.2010.200378 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) presents with progressive 
      ptosis, dysphagia and limb girdle weakness, and is caused by expansion of a 
      trinucleotide tandem repeat within the gene encoding poly-(A) binding protein 2. 
      AIM: To review the clinical manifestations of all genetically confirmed patients 
      with OPMD in Scotland identified since 2002, and to estimate the delay between 
      symptom onset and diagnosis. Method Retrospective case note review. RESULTS: The 
      authors identified 17 patients. The commonest first symptom was ptosis at about 
      the age of 60 years. Three to 20 years elapsed from the onset of ptosis to OPMD 
      diagnosis. In 14 (82%) patients, dysphagia had developed by the time of 
      diagnosis, and four (24%) out of these 14 patients with dysphagia had undergone a 
      decade of investigation and treatment for pharyngeal problems. Thirteen patients 
      (77%) also had symptoms of limb girdle muscle weakness. Every patient had a 
      first-degree relative with ptosis. CONCLUSIONS: OPMD could have been diagnosed 
      earlier in every patient in this case series. Greater awareness of OPMD among 
      ophthalmologists, gastroenterologists and otolaryngologists may lead to earlier 
      diagnosis, improved management and avoidance of unnecessary investigations.

AB  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an inherited neuromuscular disease 
      associated with a short trinucleotide repeat expansion in Exon 1 of the PABPN1 
      gene. OPMD is uncommon in East Asian populations, and there have been no previous 
      reports of Thai patients. We studied clinical and molecular genetic features of 
      six unrelated Thai patients with autosomal dominant OPMD. All patients had 
      expansions of the guanine-cytosine-guanine (GCG) repeat ranging from three to 
      seven additional repeats in the PABPN1 gene. Haplotype analysis showed that these 
      mutations might have originated independently. Analysis of the size of the GCG 
      repeat in the PABPN1 gene in 200 Thai control patients showed that 0.5% of the 
      control subjects possessed (GCG)(7), thereby suggesting that the prevalence of 
      autosomal recessive OPMD in the Thai population was approximately 1 in 160,000. 
      In conclusion, our data suggest that OPMD in Thailand may be more common than 
      previously thought.

AB  - Genomic instability at loci with tandem arrays of simple repeats is the cause for 
      many neurological, neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. When located in 
      coding regions, disease-associated expansions of trinucleotide repeats are 
      translated into homopolymeric amino acid stretches of glutamine or alanine. 
      Polyalanine expansions in the poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene 
      causes oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). To gain novel insight into the 
      molecular pathophysiology of OPMD, we studied the interaction of cellular 
      proteins with normal and expanded PABPN1. Pull-down assays show that heat shock 
      proteins including Hsp70, and type I arginine methyl transferases (PRMT1 and 
      PRMT3) associate preferentially with expanded PABPN1. Immunofluorescence 
      microscopy further reveals accumulation of these proteins at intranuclear 
      inclusions in muscle from OPMD patients. Recombinant PABPN1 with expanded 
      polyalanine stretches binds Hsp70 with higher affinity, and data from molecular 
      simulations suggest that expansions of the PABPN1 polyalanine tract result in 
      transition from a disordered, flexible conformation to a stable helical secondary 
      structure. Taken together, our results suggest that the pathological mutation in 
      the PABPN1 gene alters the protein conformation and induces a preferential 
      interaction with type I PRMTs and Hsp70 chaperones. This in turn causes 
      sequestration in intranuclear inclusions, possibly leading to a progressive 
      cellular defect in arginine methylation and chaperone activity.

PG  - 21-4
LID - 10.1016/j.jns.2008.11.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late onset autosomal 
      dominant muscle disorder. OPMD is caused by a short trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion encoding an expanded polyalanine tract in the polyadenylate 
      binding-protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene. We identified and characterized a PABPN1 
      mutation in a Taiwanese family with OPMD. METHODS: The phenotypic and genotypic 
      characteristics of all subjects were evaluated in a Taiwanese OPMD family. 
      Genetic alterations in the PABPN1 gene were identified using PCR and DNA 
      sequencing. RESULTS: Ten subjects with OPMD (6 symptomatic and 4 asymptomatic) 
      within the Taiwanese family carried a novel mutation in the PABPN1 gene. The 
      normal (GCG)6(GCA)3GCG sequence was replaced by (GCG)6(GCA)(GCG)4(GCA)3GCG due to 
      an insertion of (GCG)4GCA into the normal allele in the Taiwanese OPMD subjects. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to a single GCG expansion in most of OPMD patients in 
      the literature, an insertion of (GCG)4GCA in the PABPN1 gene was found in the 
      Taiwanese OPMD subjects. The identification of this mutation appears to support 
      the molecular mechanism of unequal cross-over of two PABPN1 alleles.

      alanine expansion domain using proteolysis and solid-state NMR spectroscopy.
PG  - 7172-3
LID - 10.1021/ja800120s [doi]
AB  - The nuclear poly(A) binding protein PABPN1 possesses a natural 10 alanine stretch 
      that can be extended to 17 Ala by codon expansion. The expansions are associated 
      with the disease oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), which is 
      characterized histopathologically by intranuclear fibrillar deposits. Here, we 
      have studied the Ala extended fibrillar N-terminal fragment of PABPN1, 
      (N-(+7)Ala), comprising 152 amino acids. At natural abundance, cross-polarized 
      13C MAS NMR spectra are dominated by the three Ala signals with characteristic 
      beta-sheet chemical shifts. In contrast, directly polarized 13C MAS spectra show 
      a multitude of narrow lines, suggesting a large portion of highly mobile sites. 
      Proteolytic cleavage of the protein combined with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry 
      revealed a protease-resistant peptide encompassing residues 13/14 to 50-52 with 
      the poly-Ala stretch in the center. Measurements of the 1H-13Calpha dipolar 
      couplings of 13C/15N-labeled N-(+7)Ala revealed high order parameters of 0.77 for 
      the poly-Ala stretch of the fibril, while the majority of the residues of 
      N-(+7)Ala exhibited very low order parameters between 0.06 and 0.15. Only some 
      Gly residues that are flanking the Ala-rich region had significant order 
      parameters of 0.47. Thus, site-specific dynamic mapping represents a useful tool 
      to identify the topology of fibrillar proteins.

AB  - Expansions of a (GCN)10/polyalanine tract in the Poly(A) Binding Protein Nuclear 
      1 (PABPN1) cause autosomal dominant oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). In 
      OPMD muscles, as in models, PABPN1 accumulates in intranuclear inclusions (INIs) 
      whereas in other diseases caused by similar polyalanine expansions, the mutated 
      proteins have been shown to abnormally accumulate in the cytoplasm. This study 
      presents the impact on the subcellular localization of PABPN1 produced by large 
      expansions or deletion of its polyalanine tract. Large tracts of more than 24 
      alanines result in the nuclear accumulation of PABPN1 in SFRS2-positive 
      functional speckles and a significant decline in cell survival. These large 
      expansions do not cause INIs formation nor do they lead to cytoplasmic 
      accumulation. Deletion of the polyalanine tract induces the formation of 
      aggregates that are located on either side and cross the nuclear membrane, 
      highlighting the possible role of the N-terminal polyalanine tract in PABPN1 
      nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. We also show that even though five other proteins 
      with polyalanine tracts tend to aggregate when over-expressed they do not 
      co-aggregate with PABPN1 INIs. This study presents the first experimental 
      evidence that there may be a relative loss of function in OPMD by decreasing the 
      availability of PABPN1 through an INI-independent mechanism.

AB  - Formation of nuclear inclusions consisting of aggregates of a polyalanine 
      expansion mutant of nuclear poly(A)-binding protein (PABPN1) is the hallmark of 
      oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). OPMD is a late onset autosomal 
      dominant disease. Patients with this disorder exhibit progressive swallowing 
      difficulty and drooping of their eye lids, which starts around the age of 50. 
      Previously we have shown that treatment of cells expressing the mutant PABPN1 
      with a number of chemicals such as ibuprofen, indomethacin, ZnSO(4), and 
      8-hydroxy-quinoline induces HSP70 expression and reduces PABPN1 aggregation. In 
      these studies we have shown that expression of additional HSPs including HSP27, 
      HSP40, and HSP105 were induced in mutant PABPN1 expressing cells following 
      exposure to the chemicals mentioned above. Furthermore, all three additional HSPs 
      were translocated to the nucleus and probably helped to properly fold the mutant 
      PABPN1 by co-localizing with this protein.

TI  - Identification of a novel mutation in a Korean patient with oculopharyngeal 
      muscular dystrophy.
PG  - 89-92
AB  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset muscle disorder 
      characterized by progressive dysphagia and bilateral ptosis. Mutations in the 
      polyadenylate binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene have been found to cause 
      OPMD. The typical mutation is a stable trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 
      first exon of the PABPN1 gene, in which (GCG)(6) is the normal repeat length. We 
      investigated a Korean patient with OPMD and identified a novel mutation: a 
      heterozygous insertion of a 9-bp sequence [(GCG)(GCA)(GCA); c.27_28insGCGGCAGCA] 
      instead of the (GCG) repeat expansion, resulting in an in-frame insertion of 
      three alanines (p.A10insAAA). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
      report of a genetically confirmed case of OPMD in Korea.

TI  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy: a point mutation which mimics the effect of 
      the PABPN1 gene triplet repeat expansion mutation.
PG  - e23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an autosomal dominant 
      late onset neuromuscular disease characterised by proximal muscle weakness, 
      ptosis, and swallowing difficulty. The only causative mutation described to date 
      is a triplet repeat expansion consisting of two to seven additional base triplets 
      in a repeat sequence in exon 1 of the polyadenine binding protein nuclear 1 
      (PABPN1) gene. This results in an increase in length of a polyalanine tract in 
      the PABPN1 protein from 10 to 12-17 residues. OBJECTIVE: Description of another 
      mutation in a case of OPMD. METHODS: Sequence analysis of exon 1 of the PABPN1 
      gene was undertaken on 202 patients referred for a possible diagnosis of OPMD but 
      negative for the triplet repeat expansion mutation. RESULTS: A case was 
      identified with typical symptoms of OPMD, negative for the repeat expansion 
      mutation but with a missense mutation in PABPN1 close to the 3' end of the normal 
      polyalanine codon repeat sequence. CONCLUSIONS: The single base mutation changes 
      a glycine codon to an alanine codon and results in an increase in the number of 
      contiguous polyalanine codons. This mimics the effect of the common triplet 
      repeat expansion mutation and represents a previously undescribed mechanism of 
      mutation.

TI  - A Drosophila model of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy reveals intrinsic 
      toxicity of PABPN1.
PG  - 2253-62
AB  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an adult-onset syndrome 
      characterized by progressive degeneration of particular muscles. OPMD is caused 
      by short GCG repeat expansions within the gene encoding the nuclear 
      poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABPN1) that extend an N-terminal polyalanine tract in 
      the protein. Mutant PABPN1 aggregates as nuclear inclusions in OMPD patient 
      muscles. We have created a Drosophila model of OPMD that recapitulates the 
      features of the human disorder: progressive muscle degeneration, with muscle 
      defects proportional to the number of alanines in the tract, and formation of 
      PABPN1 nuclear inclusions. Strikingly, the polyalanine tract is not absolutely 
      required for muscle degeneration, whereas another domain of PABPN1, the 
      RNA-binding domain and its function in RNA binding are required. This 
      demonstrates that OPMD does not result from polyalanine toxicity, but from an 
      intrinsic property of PABPN1. We also identify several suppressors of the OPMD 
      phenotype. This establishes our OPMD Drosophila model as a powerful in vivo test 
      to understand the disease process and develop novel therapeutic strategies.

TI  - A de novo PABPN1 germline mutation in a patient with oculopharyngeal muscular 
      dystrophy.
PG  - 111-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset autosomal 
      dominantly inherited disorder characterized by dysphagia, ptosis, and proximal 
      limb weakness and is caused by germline mutations (triplet repeat expansions) in 
      the polyadenylate binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene. OBJECTIVE: To describe 
      a 70-year-old female patient with OPMD on the clinical and molecular genetic 
      level and to develop a rapid and efficient molecular genetic screening method to 
      study large patient groups. METHODS: Detailed family history and clinical 
      assessment of the OPMD patient were followed by mutation analysis of the PABPN1 
      gene by direct DNA sequencing and by our newly developed method, fluorescent 
      PABPN1 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product (flPPP) method. A cohort of 50 
      healthy Swiss probands was screened using the flPPP to assess the frequency of 
      the (GCG)7 allele in the Swiss population. Cricopharyngeal myotomy was performed 
      as treatment for dysphagia. RESULTS: A heterozygous (GCG)9 triplet repeat 
      expansion in PABPN1 was identified. Since the family history proved to be 
      negative, the mutation is likely to have occurred de novo. The frequency of the 
      (GCG)7 allele among healthy Swiss controls amounted to 1%. The flPPP method 
      showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. Two years after cricopharyngeal 
      myotomy, the patient is still relieved of dysphagia. CONCLUSIONS: An 
      otolaryngologist should include OPMD in the differential diagnosis of a patient 
      presenting with dysphagia, as this symptom can be the first sign of the disease 
      and family history can be negative. Molecular genetic testing represents a highly 
      accurate and rapid way to confirm the clinical diagnosis of OPMD. Cricopharyngeal 
      myotomy relieves the patient of dysphagia in the majority of cases.

TI  - Ectopic expression of a polyalanine expansion mutant of poly(A)-binding protein 
      N1 in muscle cells in culture inhibits myogenesis.
PG  - 815-22
AB  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an adult-onset dominant genetic 
      disease caused by the expansion of a GCG trinucleotide repeat that encodes the 
      polyalanine tract at the N-terminus of the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein 
      (PABPN1). Presence of intranuclear inclusions (INIs) containing PABPN1 aggregates 
      in the skeletal muscles is the hallmark of OPMD. Here, we show that ectopic 
      expression of the mutant PABPN1 produced INIs in a muscle cell culture model and 
      reduced expression of several muscle-specific proteins including alpha-actin, 
      slow troponin C, muscle creatine kinase, and two myogenic transcription factors, 
      myogenin and MyoD. However, the levels of two upstream regulators of the MyoD 
      gene, the Myf-5 and Pax3/7, were not affected, but both proteins co-localized 
      with the PABPN1 aggregates in the mutant PABPN1 overexpressing cells. In these 
      cells, although myogenin and MyoD levels were reduced, these two transcription 
      factors did not co-localize with the mutant PABPN1 aggregates. Therefore, 
      sequestration of Myf5 and Pax3/7 by the mutant PABPN1 aggregates was a specific 
      effect on these factors. Our results suggest that trapping of these two important 
      myogenic determinants may interfere with an early step in myogenesis.

TI  - Induction of HSP70 expression and recruitment of HSC70 and HSP70 in the nucleus 
      reduce aggregation of a polyalanine expansion mutant of PABPN1 in HeLa cells.
PG  - 3673-84
AB  - Nuclear inclusions formed by the aggregation of a polyalanine expansion mutant of 
      the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein (PABPN1) is a hallmark of oculopharyngeal 
      muscular dystrophy (OPMD). OPMD is a dominant autosomal disease in which patients 
      exhibit progressive difficulty of swallowing and eyelid elevation, starting 
      around the age of 50. At present, there is no specific treatment to reduce the 
      aggregate burden in patients. However, in cell culture models of OPMD, reduction 
      of protein aggregation can be achieved by ectopic expression of HSP70. As gene 
      transfer may not be the most effective means to elevate HSP70 levels, we tested 
      four pharmacological agents for their ability to induce HSP70, recruit both HSP70 
      and HSC70 into the cell nucleus and reduce mutant PABPN1 aggregation in a HeLa 
      cell culture model. We show here that exposure to moderate levels of ZnSO4, 
      8-hydroxyquinoline, ibuprofen and indomethacin produced a robust stress response 
      resulting in the induction of HSP70 in HeLa cells expressing the mutant PABPN1 as 
      a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein. Both HSP70 and the constitutive 
      chaperone HSC70 localized in the nucleus of cells treated with any one of the 
      four agents. This stress response was similar to what was observed following 
      hyperthermia. All four agents also caused a significant reduction in the cellular 
      burden of protein aggregates, as was judged by confocal microscopy and solubility 
      changes of the aggregates. A concomitant reduction of cell death in drug-treated 
      mutant PABPN1 expressing cells was also observed.

TI  - In vivo aggregation properties of the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1.
PG  - 752-62
AB  - A broad range of degenerative diseases is associated with intracellular 
      inclusions formed by toxic, aggregation-prone mutant proteins. Intranuclear 
      inclusions constitute a pathological hallmark of oculopharyngeal muscular 
      dystrophy (OPMD), a dominantly inherited disease caused by (GCG) repeat 
      expansions in the gene that encodes for nuclear poly(A) binding protein (PABPN1). 
      The mutation results in an extended polyalanine stretch that has been proposed to 
      induce protein aggregation and formation of intranuclear inclusions. Here we show 
      that normal PABPN1 is inherently aggregation-prone when exogenously expressed in 
      either HeLa or myogenic C2 cells. Similar deposits of insoluble PABPN1 are formed 
      by variant forms of the protein containing either a polyalanine expansion or a 
      complete deletion of the polyalanine tract, indicating that the mutation 
      responsible for OPMD is not essential for formation of PABPN1 inclusions. In 
      contrast, interfering with any of the protein domains required for stimulation of 
      poly(A) polymerase prevents the formation of inclusions. Most surprisingly, 
      photobleaching experiments reveal that both normal and expanded PABPN1 molecules 
      are not irreversibly sequestered into aggregates, but rather move rapidly in and 
      out of the inclusions. These findings have important implications for the 
      interpretation of OPMD model systems based on exogenous expression of PABPN1.

TI  - Transgenic expression of an expanded (GCG)13 repeat PABPN1 leads to weakness and 
      coordination defects in mice.
PG  - 528-36
AB  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset disorder caused by a 
      (GCG)n trinucleotide repeat expansion in the poly(A) binding protein nuclear-1 
      (PABPN1) gene, which in turn leads to an expanded polyalanine tract in the 
      protein. We generated transgenic mice expressing either the wild type or the 
      expanded form of human PABPN1, and transgenic animals with the expanded form 
      showed clear signs of abnormal limb clasping, muscle weakness, coordination 
      deficits, and peripheral nerves alterations. Analysis of mitotic and postmitotic 
      tissues in those transgenic animals revealed ubiquitinated PABPN1-positive 
      intranuclear inclusions (INIs) in neuronal cells. This latter observation led us 
      to test and confirm the presence of similar INIs in postmortem brain sections 
      from an OPMD patient. Our results indicate that expanded PABPN1, presumably via 
      the toxic effects of its polyalanine tract, can lead to inclusion formation and 
      neurodegeneration in both the mouse and the human.

TI  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy with PABPN1 mutation in a Chinese Malaysian 
      woman.
PG  - 262-4
AB  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an autosomal dominant disorder of 
      middle age presenting as progressive dysphagia and eyelid ptosis, due to short 
      expansions of the GCG trinucleotide repeat (from GCG6 to GCG8-13) in the 
      polyadenylate binding-protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene. OPMD is rarely seen in 
      Asians and morphologically and/or genetically confirmed cases have been reported 
      in Japanese kindreds only. We report a 64 year old Chinese-Malaysian woman who 
      presented with progressive dysphagia and bilateral ptosis for about 6 years. Her 
      mother and elder brother (both deceased) were believed to be affected. Muscle 
      histopathology revealed angulated fibres with rimmed vacuoles. Genetic analysis 
      showed repeat expansion in one allele to (GCG)9 while normal in the other (GCG)6. 
      This is the first non-Japanese Asian family with genetically confirmed OPMD.

TI  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD): analysis of the PABPN1 gene expansion 
      sequence in 86 patients reveals 13 different expansion types and further evidence 
      for unequal recombination as the mutational mechanism.
PG  - 267-71
AB  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an autosomal dominant late-onset 
      neuromuscular degenerative disease characterised by proximal muscle weakness, 
      ptosis and swallowing difficulty. The causative genetic abnormality is an 
      expansion consisting of 2-7 additional base triplets in a repeat sequence in exon 
      1 of the PABPN1 (PABP2) gene and results in an increase in length of the 
      polyalanine tract in the PABPN1 protein from 10 to 12-17 residues. The expansions 
      are stable through meiosis and mitosis suggesting a different mechanism of 
      mutation from that of most other triplet repeat mutations. Most reports describe 
      OPMD expansions as consisting of multiples of a GCG sequence. However, some 
      studies have detected GCA interspersions. We have analysed 86 OPMD patients with 
      a PABPN1 gene expansion, including three compound heterozygotes, and have 
      identified 13 different types of expansion mutation, six of which contain GCA and 
      GCG and almost all of which are consistent with a mutational mechanism of unequal 
      recombination.

TI  - Trinucleotide expansions leading to an extended poly-L-alanine segment in the 
      poly (A) binding protein PABPN1 cause fibril formation.
PG  - 2685-92
AB  - The nuclear poly(A) binding protein (PABPN1) stimulates poly(A) polymerase and 
      controls the lengths of poly(A) tails during pre-mRNA processing. The wild-type 
      protein possesses 10 consecutive Ala residues immediately after the start 
      methionine. Trinucleotide expansions in the coding sequence result in an 
      extension of the Ala stretch to maximal 17 Ala residues in total. Individuals 
      carrying the trinucleotide expansions suffer from oculopharyngeal muscular 
      dystrophy (OPMD). Intranuclear inclusions consisting predominantly of PABPN1 have 
      been recognized as a pathological hallmark of the genetic disorder. To elucidate 
      the molecular events that lead to disease, recombinant PABPN1, and N-terminal 
      fragments of the protein with varying poly-L-alanine stretches were analyzed. As 
      the full-length protein displayed a strong tendency to aggregate into amorphous 
      deposits, soluble N-terminal fragments were also studied. Expansion of the 
      poly-L-alanine sequence to the maximal length observed in OPMD patients led to an 
      increase of alpha-helical structure. Upon prolonged incubation the protein was 
      found in fibrils that showed all characteristics of amyloid-like fibers. The 
      lag-phase of fibril formation could be reduced by seeding. Structural analysis of 
      the fibrils indicated antiparallel beta-sheets.

TI  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) due to a small duplication in the 
      PABPN1 gene.
PG  - 553
AB  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late onset autosomal dominant 
      muscle disorder. The OPMD-locus has been mapped to chromosome 14q11.2-q13. The 
      polyadenylate binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1; PABP2) gene has been identified 
      as the mutated gene. The mutation consists of a short meiotically stable 
      trinucleotide repeat in the first exon of PABPN1 gene. We have investigated Dutch 
      OPMD patients from four unrelated families and identified a new mutation in two 
      of the four families. Instead of a repeat expansion we found a duplication in the 
      first exon of the PABPN1 gene (c.27_28ins12, p.11_12insAAAA). The identification 
      of this new mutation supports the theory of unequal crossing-over as molecular 
      mechanism causing the mutation in the PABPN1 gene responsible for OPMD, and not 
      the slippage model.

TI  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy in Hispanic New Mexicans.
PG  - 2437-40
AB  - CONTEXT: Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a rare myopathy caused by 
      polyalanine triplet repeat expansion in the gene for poly(A) binding protein 2 
      (PABP2) and is found in isolated cohorts throughout the world. We have observed 
      numerous cases of OPMD in New Mexico. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinical, 
      genetic, and demographic features of the OPMD population in New Mexico. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort study with analysis of outpatient clinic 
      medical records from 1965 to 2001 at the University of New Mexico Hospital and 
      the New Mexico VA Health Care System in Albuquerque, which serve the entire 
      state. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical phenotype, supplemented with genetic 
      confirmation (n = 10 patients) and in-depth clinical evaluations (n = 49 
      patients). RESULTS: We identified 216 cases of OPMD (99 women and 117 men) from 
      39 kindreds of New Mexicans spanning up to 4 generations. All patients were 
      Hispanic, and the majority of probands came from northern New Mexico. In patients 
      who had both ocular and pharyngeal muscle weakness, ptosis was just as likely to 
      occur before or concurrent with dysphagia. Proximal limb muscle weakness and gait 
      abnormalities were common and occurred later than ocular or pharyngeal weakness. 
      The clinical expression of OPMD caused marked debility, although life-table 
      analysis showed no decrease in life expectancy compared with unaffected family 
      members (P =.81). Ten individuals from different kindreds were found to have an 
      identical polyalanine triplet repeat expansion ([GCG](9)) in the PABP2 gene. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Individuals in this cohort had clinical and genetic characteristics 
      of classic OPMD. Longevity was not affected, but patients experienced 
      considerable morbidity. The origin of the PABP2 mutation in New Mexican OPMD 
      patients is unclear, although the geographic and genetic isolation of northern 
      New Mexicans with a long ancestry in this region may have contributed to the 
      development of this cohort. This disease cohort represents a large and previously 
      unrecognized health care issue in the state of New Mexico and should serve to 
      raise the awareness of this disorder among clinicians who treat Hispanics in the 
      Southwest and throughout the United States.

TI  - Unusual triplet expansion associated with neurogenic changes in a family with 
      oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy.
PG  - 45-52
AB  - The occasional observation of neurogenic features in oculopharyngeal muscular 
      dystrophy (OPMD) is unclear both in nosological and in etiological respects. 
      Studies are reported here of a family with autosomal-dominant OPMD involving 
      seven members over three generations. In three of them muscle biopsies were 
      performed. Two of the patients (a 45-year-old sister and a 57-year-old brother of 
      the third generation) were studied in more detail and, in addition to the typical 
      changes of OPMD, showed a neurogenic component both by electrophysiology and 
      morphology. Molecular genetic investigations revealed a repeat unit of 
      (GCG/GCA)13 in the first exon of the poly(A)binding-protein2 gene in both 
      siblings. A possible association of this unusually long triplet repeat extension 
      with the atypical phenotype is considered and has to be verified in other cases.

TI  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy: phenotypic and genotypic studies in a UK 
      population.
PG  - 522-6
AB  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an autosomal dominant disorder of 
      late onset that commonly presents with ptosis and dysphagia. The genetic basis of 
      the condition has been identified recently as a stable trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in exon 1 of the poly(A) binding protein 2 gene (PABP2), in which 
      (GCG)(6) is the normal repeat length. The prevalence of OPMD is greatest in 
      patients of French-Canadian origin. It is not clear if expansion repeat length is 
      a reliable test in other populations. In this study, we analysed the phenotypic 
      and genotypic characteristics of 31 patients with OPMD in the UK. Ptosis was the 
      first reported symptom in two-thirds of the patients, and half of the subjects 
      studied had evidence of ophthalmoplegia. All but one family had a pathological 
      expansion in the PABP2 gene, ranging from (GCG)(8) to (GCG)(13). In contrast to 
      the French-Canadian population, (GCG)(10) was almost as common as (GCG)(9), 
      evidence against a strong founder effect in the UK population. There was a weak 
      association between repeat length and age of disease onset. Patients with longer 
      repeat lengths, such as (GCG)(13), developed severe limb weakness early in the 
      disease. We were unable to detect the (GCG)(7) polymorphism in over 200 normal 
      controls, suggesting that the frequency of this expansion is lower than that 
      found in the French-Canadian population. One family was negative for the 
      expansion. Affected members presented with the classical features of OPMD, namely 
      ptosis, dysphagia and cytoplasmic inclusions on muscle biopsy, although with some 
      atypical features, such as early age of onset, high serum levels of creatine 
      kinase and a profound ophthalmoplegia. This family is an example of a GCG 
      expansion-negative oculopharyngeal syndrome requiring further genetic 
      investigation. We conclude that PABP2 analysis is a reliable non-invasive 
      diagnostic test for OPMD in the UK population.

AB  - Short GCG repeat expansions in the PABP2 gene were recently shown to cause 
      oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) in French-Canadian and Italian 
      pedigrees. We diagnosed OPMD in 16 German patients by the detection of GCG repeat 
      expansions, confirming genetic homogeneity. Myopathic and neurogenic changes were 
      found in skeletal muscle biopsies. Age of onset and severity of disease were not 
      correlated with the number of repeats.

TI  - Oculopharyngeal MD among Bukhara Jews is due to a founder (GCG)9 mutation in the 
      PABP2 gene.
PG  - 1267-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether all cases of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy 
      (OPMD) among Bukhara Jews share the same founder mutation. BACKGROUND: Autosomal 
      dominant OPMD is caused by a (GCG)8-13 repeat expansion in the polyadenylation 
      binding protein 2 (PABP2) gene. The disease has a worldwide distribution but is 
      particularly prevalent in Bukhara Jews and in French Canadians, in whom it was 
      introduced by three sisters in 1648. METHODS: We established the size of the 
      PABP2 mutation in 23 Bukhara Jewish patients belonging to eight unrelated 
      families. In all families, we constructed haplotypes for the carrying chromosomes 
      composed of the alleles for eight chromosome 14q polymorphic markers. RESULTS: 
      All patients share a (GCG)9 PABP2 mutation and a four-marker haplotype. 
      Furthermore, a shared intron single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the PABP2 
      gene 2.6Kb from the mutation was not observed in 22 families with (GCG)9 
      mutations from nine different countries. The smaller size of the chromosomal 
      region in linkage disequilibrium around the mutation in Bukhara Jews, as compared 
      with French Canadians, suggests a founder effect that occurred more than 350 
      years ago. Based on the Luria-Delbruck corrected "genetic clock," we estimate 
      that the mutation appeared or was introduced once in the Bukhara Jewish 
      population between AD 872 and 1512 (mean, AD 1243). CONCLUSION: OPMD among 
      Bukhara Jews is the result of a shared, historically distinct, PABP2 (GCG)9 
      mutation that likely arose or was introduced in this population at the time they 
      first settled in Bukhara and Samarkand during the 13th or 14th centuries.

TI  - Nuclear accumulation of expanded PABP2 gene product in oculopharyngeal muscular 
      dystrophy.
PG  - 1549-54
AB  - Autosomal dominant oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an adult-onset 
      disease caused by (GCG) repeat expansions in exon 1 of the poly(A) binding 
      protein 2 gene (PABP2). To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the 
      disease, we raised an antiserum against a synthetic peptide fragment predicted 
      from PABP2 cDNA. The peptide corresponded to amino acids 271-291 where a cluster 
      of posttranslational arginine methylation occurs. We examined the subcellular 
      localization of PABP2 in muscle specimens from five patients with OPMD, 14 
      patients with various neuromuscular disorders, and three normal controls. All 
      Japanese patients with OPMD have been shown to have expanded (GCG)(8, 9, or 11) 
      mutations in PABP2, as well as intranuclear tubulofilamentous inclusions (ITFI) 
      of 8.5 nm. None of 50 separate Japanese control individuals were shown to have 
      expanded (GCG) repeat in PABP2. Positive immunoreaction for polyclonal PABP2 was 
      confined to the intranuclear aggregates of muscle fibers exclusively in patients 
      with OPMD. Frequency of the nuclei positive for PABP2 (2%) was similar to that of 
      ITFI detected by electron microscopy (2.5%). There was no apparent relationship 
      between the frequency of PABP2-positive intranuclear aggregates and the severity 
      of muscle fiber damage. In contrast, nuclear immunoreaction was not detected in 
      any samples from normal controls or from other neuromuscular diseases. These 
      results suggest the presence of molecular modification of the product of expanded 
      (GCG) repeat in PABP2, since the synthetic antigen peptide may not recognize a 
      highly dimethylated cluster of arginine residues of the native PABP2, but may 
      recognize the mutated form. Nuclear accumulation of expanded PABP2 product 
      implies a causative role for ITFI.

      oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy are reported. The family has 54 members, ten 
      of whom are affected (seven male and three female), in 3 generations. Three 
      affected males, one affected female and one unaffected female of seven living 
      siblings in the third generation were examined. Bilateral ptosis developed in the 
      4th and 5th decades in the three male cases, and in the 7th decade in the female, 
      and this was followed by diplopia, nasal voice, dysphagia and muscle weakness. In 
      addition, severe external ophthalmoplegia, dysphonia, and proximal amyotrophy 
      were prominent in this family. Electromyographs revealed myogenic/neurogenic 
      changes, and computed tomography disclosed selective muscle wasting with fatty 
      replacement, predominantly in the lower extremities. Muscle biopsy in the four 
      affected patients showed variation in fiber size, and the presence of small 
      angulated fibers and occasional rimmed vacuoles. Electron microscopic examination 
      revealed an accumulation of filamentous inclusions in muscle fiber nuclei. DNA 
      analysis identified that (GCG)(6) in the PABP2 gene was expanded to (GCG)(11) in 
      the four affected cases examined. All studies were negative in the one 
      unaffected. These results confirm that OPMD is caused by GCG short expansion and 
      provides insights into the genetic mechanisms which may contribute to adult onset 
      myopathy, confined to oculopharyngeal muscles.

TI  - GCG genetic expansions in Italian patients with oculopharyngeal muscular 
      dystrophy.
PG  - 608-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To screen Italian patients with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy 
      (OPMD) for GCG repeat expansions in the Poly(A) binding-protein 2 (PABP2) gene. 
      BACKGROUND: Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy is an adult-onset autosomal 
      dominant muscle disease linked to 14q11 pathologically characterized by unique 
      8.5 nm intranuclear filaments in skeletal muscle fibers. Short expansions of a 
      (GCG)6 repeat located in exon 1 of the newly isolated PABP2 gene have been 
      demonstrated in a large number of OPMD families. METHODS: We studied 18 patients 
      diagnosed with OPMD. A muscle biopsy was performed in 16 patients. Screening for 
      the pathologic expansion was performed on a PCR amplified DNA fragment 
      encompassing the GCG repeat. RESULTS: Heterozygous (GCG)-repeat expansions were 
      detected in 13 patients in association with (GCG)6 normal allele or (GCG)7 
      polymorphic allele. All the patients whose muscle biopsy showed typical 8.5 nm 
      intranuclear filaments had a mutated PABP2 allele. Five patients with no 
      intranuclear filaments were homozygous for the normal (GCG)6 allele. The 
      pathologic expansion appeared to be stable with no variation among family members 
      and between different tissues as blood and skeletal muscle in the same 
      individual. CONCLUSIONS: These data 1) further confirm PABP2 gene analysis as a 
      valuable tool in OPMD diagnosis; 2) indicate that PABP2 gene mutations are always 
      present among Italian patients with morphologically proven OPMD, suggesting 
      genetic homogeneity of the disease; and 3) strengthen the putative role of 
      mutated PABP2 protein in filamentous inclusions accumulation.

TI  - Short GCG expansions in the PABP2 gene cause oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy.
PG  - 164-7
AB  - Autosomal dominant oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an adult-onset 
      disease with a world-wide distribution. It usually presents in the sixth decade 
      with progressive swallowing difficulties (dysphagia), eyelid drooping (ptosis) 
      and proximal limb weakness. Unique nuclear filament inclusions in skeletal muscle 
      fibres are its pathological hallmark. We isolated the poly(A) binding protein 2 
      gene (PABP2) from a 217-kb candidate interval on chromosome 14q11 (B.B. et al., 
      manuscript submitted). A (GCG)6 repeat encoding a polyalanine tract located at 
      the N terminus of the protein was expanded to (GCG)8-13 in the 144 OPMD families 
      screened. More severe phenotypes were observed in compound heterozygotes for the 
      (GCG)9 mutation and a (GCG)7 allele that is found in 2% of the population, 
      whereas homozygosity for the (GCG)7 allele leads to autosomal recessive OPMD. 
      Thus the (GCG)7 allele is an example of a polymorphism which can act either as a 
      modifier of a dominant phenotype or as a recessive mutation. Pathological 
      expansions of the polyalanine tract may cause mutated PABP2 oligomers to 
      accumulate as filament inclusions in nuclei.

TI  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD)--report and genetic studies of an 
      Australian kindred.
PG  - 52-5
AB  - Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset autosomal dominant 
      disease. Due to a founder effect, it is most commonly found in the French 
      Canadian population. The gene has recently been mapped to chromosome 14q11.2-q13 
      in some of these families. Here we report an Australian kindred of German descent 
      with OPMD. Linkage analysis supports its locus to chromosome 14q. Repeat 
      expansion studies were also carried out, but a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion 
      detected did not cosegregate with the disease. We conclude that there is no 
      evidence of genetic heterogeneity or involvement of repeat expansion in OPMD.
