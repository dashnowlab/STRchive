      repeat expansion in AFF3 associated with intellectual disability.

AB  - GC-rich tandem repeat expansions (TREs) are often associated with DNA 
      methylation, gene silencing and folate-sensitive fragile sites, and underlie 
      several congenital and late-onset disorders. Through a combination of 
      DNA-methylation profiling and tandem repeat genotyping, we identified 24 
      methylated TREs and investigated their effects on human traits using phenome-wide 
      association studies in 168,641 individuals from the UK Biobank, identifying 156 
      significant TRE-trait associations involving 17 different TREs. Of these, a GCC 
      expansion in the promoter of AFF3 was associated with a 2.4-fold reduced 
      probability of completing secondary education, an effect size comparable to 
      several recurrent pathogenic microdeletions. In a cohort of 6,371 probands with 
      neurodevelopmental problems of suspected genetic etiology, we observed a 
      significant enrichment of AFF3 expansions compared with controls. With a 
      population prevalence that is at least fivefold higher than the TRE that causes 
      fragile X syndrome, AFF3 expansions represent a major cause of neurodevelopmental 
      delay.

AB  - Folate-sensitive fragile sites (FSFS) are a rare cytogenetically visible subset 
      of dynamic mutations. Of the eight molecularly characterized FSFS, four are 
      associated with intellectual disability (ID). Cytogenetic expression results from 
      CGG tri-nucleotide-repeat expansion mutation associated with local CpG 
      hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing. The best studied is the FRAXA 
      site in the FMR1 gene, where large expansions cause fragile X syndrome, the most 
      common inherited ID syndrome. Here we studied three families with FRA2A 
      expression at 2q11 associated with a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental 
      phenotypes. We identified a polymorphic CGG repeat in a conserved, brain-active 
      alternative promoter of the AFF3 gene, an autosomal homolog of the X-linked 
      AFF2/FMR2 gene: Expansion of the AFF2 CGG repeat causes FRAXE ID. We found that 
      FRA2A-expressing individuals have mosaic expansions of the AFF3 CGG repeat in the 
      range of several hundred repeat units. Moreover, bisulfite sequencing and 
      pyrosequencing both suggest AFF3 promoter hypermethylation. cSNP-analysis 
      demonstrates monoallelic expression of the AFF3 gene in FRA2A carriers thus 
      predicting that FRA2A expression results in functional haploinsufficiency for 
      AFF3 at least in a subset of tissues. By whole-mount in situ hybridization the 
      mouse AFF3 ortholog shows strong regional expression in the developing brain, 
      somites and limb buds in 9.5-12.5dpc mouse embryos. Our data suggest that there 
      may be an association between FRA2A and a delay in the acquisition of motor and 
      language skills in the families studied here. However, additional cases are 
      required to firmly establish a causal relationship.
