TI  - Repeat Expansions in PLIN4 Cause Autosomal Dominant Vacuolar Myopathy With 
      Sarcolemmal Features.
LID - 10.1002/acn3.70146 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aim to describe and characterize two unrelated Spanish families 
      suffering from an autosomal dominant autophagic vacuolar myopathy caused by 
      repeat expansions in PLIN4. METHODS: We evaluated the clinical phenotype and 
      muscle imaging, and performed a genetic workup that included exome sequencing, 
      muscle RNAseq, and long-read genome sequencing. Muscle pathology was assessed by 
      means of histochemistry, electron microscopy, PLIN4, p62, LC3, and NBR1 
      immunofluorescence and/or western blotting. Detailed characterization of 
      autophagic vacuoles was performed. RESULTS: Patients presented around the age of 
      30 with mild proximal weakness followed by prominent distal weakness in lower 
      legs, eventually spreading to other muscle groups. Muscle biopsies showed unique 
      pathological features characterized by numerous rimmed vacuoles that displayed 
      sarcolemmal features and were located beneath the sarcolemma and within the 
      cytoplasm. Ultrastructural studies showed autophagic vacuoles, replications, and 
      loops of the basal lamina and tubulofilamentous sarcoplasmic inclusions. p62 and 
      NBR1 co-localized with PLIN4 at the sarcolemma and vacuoles. LC3 immunoreactivity 
      and other lysosomal markers were increased at the vacuoles. Targeted long-read 
      sequencing of PLIN4 in affected individuals revealed a single expanded allele of 
      39 x 99 bp repeats in family 1 and of 37 x 99 bp repeats in family 2. 
      INTERPRETATION: We characterize two new families suffering from an autosomal 
      dominant myopathy carrying repeat expansions in PLIN4. Subsarcolemmal p62 
      expression is a powerful although nonspecific marker of this disease. No 
      correlation between the size of the expansion and clinical severity can be 
      clearly established. PLIN4 expansions should be considered in the diagnosis of 
      autosomal dominant vacuolar myopathies, especially when sarcolemmal features are 
      present.

TI  - dmTGS: Precise Targeted Enrichment Long-Read Sequencing Panel for Tandem Repeat 
      Detection.
PG  - 319-331
LID - 10.1093/clinchem/hvae164 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tandem repeats (TRs) are abundant in the human genome and associated 
      with repeat expansion disorders. Our study aimed to develop a tandem repeat panel 
      utilizing targeted long-read sequencing to evaluate known TRs associated with 
      these disorders and assess its clinical utility. METHODS: We developed a targeted 
      long-read sequencing panel for 70 TR loci, termed dynamic mutation 
      third-generation sequencing (dmTGS), using the PacBio Sequel II platform. We 
      tested 108 samples with suspected repeat expansion disorders and compared the 
      results with conventional molecular methods. RESULTS: For 108 samples, dmTGS 
      achieved an average of 8000 high-fidelity reads per sample, with a mean read 
      length of 4.7 kb and read quality of 99.9%. dmTGS outperformed repeat-primed-PCR 
      and fluorescence amplicon length analysis-PCR in distinguishing expanded from 
      normal alleles and accurately quantifying repeat counts. The method demonstrated 
      high concordance with confirmatory methods (rlinear = 0.991, P < 0.01), and 
      detected mosaicism with sensitivities of 1% for FMR1 CGG premutation and 5% for 
      full mutations. dmTGS successfully identified interruptive motifs in genes that 
      conventional methods had missed. For variable number TRs in the PLIN4 gene, dmTGS 
      identified precise repeat counts and sequence motifs. Screening 57 patients with 
      suspected genetic muscular diseases, dmTGS confirmed repeat expansions in genes 
      such as GIPC1, NOTCH2NLC, NUTM2B-AS1/LOC642361, and DMPK. Additionally, dmTGS 
      detected CCG interruptions in CTG repeats in 8 myotonic dystrophy type 1 patients 
      with detailed characterization. CONCLUSIONS: dmTGS accurately detects repeat 
      sizes and interruption motifs associated with repeat expansion disorders and 
      demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional molecular methods.

TI  - Subsarcolemmal and cytoplasmic p62 positivity and rimmed vacuoles are distinctive 
      for PLIN4-myopathy.
PG  - 1813-1819
LID - 10.1002/acn3.51666 [doi]
AB  - PLIN4-myopathy is a recently identified autosomal dominant muscular disorder 
      caused by the coding 99 bp repeat expansion in PLIN4, presenting with distal or 
      proximal weakness. Here, we report one family and one sporadic case of 
      adult-onset PLIN4-associated limb-girdle weakness, whose diagnoses were achieved 
      by a comprehensive genetic analysis workup. We provided additional evidence that 
      the combination of subsarcolemmal/cytoplasmic ubiquitin/p62 positive deposits and 
      rimmed vacuoles could serve as a strong indicator of PLIN4-myopathy. Moreover, we 
      found novel myopathological features that were ultrastructural subsarcolemmal 
      filamentous materials and membrane-bound granulofilamentous inclusions formed by 
      the co-deposition of disrupted lipid droplets and p62 protein aggregates.
