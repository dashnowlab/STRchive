TI  - dmTGS: Precise Targeted Enrichment Long-Read Sequencing Panel for Tandem Repeat 
      Detection.
PG  - 319-331
LID - 10.1093/clinchem/hvae164 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tandem repeats (TRs) are abundant in the human genome and associated 
      with repeat expansion disorders. Our study aimed to develop a tandem repeat panel 
      utilizing targeted long-read sequencing to evaluate known TRs associated with 
      these disorders and assess its clinical utility. METHODS: We developed a targeted 
      long-read sequencing panel for 70 TR loci, termed dynamic mutation 
      third-generation sequencing (dmTGS), using the PacBio Sequel II platform. We 
      tested 108 samples with suspected repeat expansion disorders and compared the 
      results with conventional molecular methods. RESULTS: For 108 samples, dmTGS 
      achieved an average of 8000 high-fidelity reads per sample, with a mean read 
      length of 4.7 kb and read quality of 99.9%. dmTGS outperformed repeat-primed-PCR 
      and fluorescence amplicon length analysis-PCR in distinguishing expanded from 
      normal alleles and accurately quantifying repeat counts. The method demonstrated 
      high concordance with confirmatory methods (rlinear = 0.991, P < 0.01), and 
      detected mosaicism with sensitivities of 1% for FMR1 CGG premutation and 5% for 
      full mutations. dmTGS successfully identified interruptive motifs in genes that 
      conventional methods had missed. For variable number TRs in the PLIN4 gene, dmTGS 
      identified precise repeat counts and sequence motifs. Screening 57 patients with 
      suspected genetic muscular diseases, dmTGS confirmed repeat expansions in genes 
      such as GIPC1, NOTCH2NLC, NUTM2B-AS1/LOC642361, and DMPK. Additionally, dmTGS 
      detected CCG interruptions in CTG repeats in 8 myotonic dystrophy type 1 patients 
      with detailed characterization. CONCLUSIONS: dmTGS accurately detects repeat 
      sizes and interruption motifs associated with repeat expansion disorders and 
      demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional molecular methods.

TI  - Subsarcolemmal and cytoplasmic p62 positivity and rimmed vacuoles are distinctive 
      for PLIN4-myopathy.
PG  - 1813-1819
LID - 10.1002/acn3.51666 [doi]
AB  - PLIN4-myopathy is a recently identified autosomal dominant muscular disorder 
      caused by the coding 99 bp repeat expansion in PLIN4, presenting with distal or 
      proximal weakness. Here, we report one family and one sporadic case of 
      adult-onset PLIN4-associated limb-girdle weakness, whose diagnoses were achieved 
      by a comprehensive genetic analysis workup. We provided additional evidence that 
      the combination of subsarcolemmal/cytoplasmic ubiquitin/p62 positive deposits and 
      rimmed vacuoles could serve as a strong indicator of PLIN4-myopathy. Moreover, we 
      found novel myopathological features that were ultrastructural subsarcolemmal 
      filamentous materials and membrane-bound granulofilamentous inclusions formed by 
      the co-deposition of disrupted lipid droplets and p62 protein aggregates.
