AB  - Background: Progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      marked by recurrent seizures and progressive myoclonus. To date, based on the 
      phenotypes and causal genes, more than 40 subtypes of PMEs have been identified, 
      and more remain to be characterized. Our study is aimed at identifying the 
      aberrant gene(s) possibly associated with PMEs in two siblings born to 
      asymptomatic parents, in the absence of known genetic mutations. Methods: 
      Clinical assessments and molecular analyses, such as the repeat expansion test 
      for CSTB; SCA1, 2, 3, 6, and 7; whole exome sequencing (WES); and mitochondrial 
      genome sequencing coupled with computational analysis, were performed. Results: A 
      family-based segregation analysis of WES data was performed to identify novel 
      genes associated with PMEs. The potassium channel, KCNH8 [c.298T>C; 
      (p.Tyr100His)], a DNA repair gene, regulator of telomere elongation helicase 1 
      (RTEL1) [c.691G>T; (p.Asp231Tyr)] and long noncoding RNA, RTEL1-TNFRSF6B 
      [chr20:62298898_G>T; NR_037882.1, hg19] were among the candidate genes that were 
      found to be associated with PMEs. These homozygous variations in siblings belong 
      to genes with a loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score of </= 0.86, expected to be 
      detrimental by multiple computational analyses, and were heterozygous in parents. 
      Additionally, computational analysis and the expression of RTEL1 and 
      RTEL1-TNFRSF6B revealed that RTEL1-TNFRSF6B may modulate RTEL1 via 
      hsa-miR-3529-3p. In the patient with the severe phenotype, a further deleterious 
      mutation in SLC22A17 was identified. No de novo variants specific to these 
      probands were identified in the mitochondrial genome. Conclusions: Our study is 
      the first to report variants in KCNH8, RTEL1, and RTEL1-TNFRSF6B among PME cases. 
      These genes when characterized fully may shed light on pathogenicity and have the 
      potential to be used in the diagnosis of PME.

TI  - CSTB gene replacement improves neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and ataxia in 
      murine type 1 progressive myoclonus epilepsy.

AB  - EPM1 is the most common form of Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy characterized by 
      late-childhood onset, ever-worsening and disabling myoclonus, seizures, ataxia, 
      psychiatric disease, and shortened lifespan. EPM1 is caused by expansions of a 
      dodecamer repeat sequence in the promoter of CSTB (cystatin B), which 
      dramatically reduces, but does not eliminate, gene expression. The relatively 
      late onset and consistent presence of a minimal amount of protein product makes 
      EPM1 a favorable target for gene replacement therapy. If treated early, these 
      children's normally developed brains could be rescued from the neurodegeneration 
      that otherwise follows, and their cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM) 
      positive status greatly reduces transgene related toxicity. We performed a 
      proof-of-concept CSTB gene replacement study in Cstb knockout mice by introducing 
      full-length human CSTB driven by the CBh promoter packaged in AAV9 and 
      administered at postnatal days 21 and 60. Mice were sacrificed at 2 or 9 months 
      of age, respectively. We observed significant improvements in expression levels 
      of neuroinflammatory pathway genes and cerebellar granule cell layer apoptosis, 
      as well as amelioration of motor impairment. The data suggest that gene 
      replacement is a promising therapeutic modality for EPM1 and could spare affected 
      children and families the ravages of this otherwise severe neurodegenerative 
      disease.

TI  - Short- and long-interval intracortical inhibition in EPM1 is related to genotype.
PG  - 208-217
LID - 10.1111/epi.17466 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Progressive myoclonic epilepsy type 1 (EPM1) is caused by biallelic 
      alterations in the CSTB gene, most commonly dodecamer repeat expansions. Although 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced long-interval intracortical 
      inhibition (LICI) was previously reported to be normal in EPM1, short-interval 
      intracortical inhibition (SICI) was reduced. We explored the association between 
      these measures and the clinical and genetic features in a separate group of 
      patients with EPM1. METHODS: TMS combined with electromyography was performed 
      under neuronavigation. LICI was induced with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 
      100 ms, and SICI with ISIs of 2 and 3 ms, and their means (mSICIs) were expressed 
      as the ratio of conditioned to unconditioned stimuli. LICI and mSICI were 
      compared between patients and controls. Nonparametric correlation was used to 
      study the association between inhibition and parameters of clinical severity, 
      including the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale (UMRS); among patients with EPM1 due 
      to biallelic expansion repeats, also the association with the number of repeats 
      was assessed. RESULTS: The study protocol was completed in 19 patients (15 with 
      biallelic expansion repeats and 4 compound heterozygotes), and 7 healthy, age- 
      and sex-matched control participants. Compared to controls, patients demonstrated 
      significantly less SICI (median mSICI ratio 1.18 vs 0.38; p < .001). Neither LICI 
      nor SICI was associated with parameters of clinical severity. In participants 
      with biallelic repeat expansions, the number of repeats in the more affected 
      allele (greater repeat number [GRN]) correlated with LICI (rho = 0.872; p < .001) 
      and SICI (rho = 0.689; p = .006). SIGNIFICANCE: Our results strengthen the 
      finding of deranged gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibition in EPM1. LICI and 
      SICI may have use as markers of GABAergic impairment in future trials of 
      disease-modifying treatment in this condition. Whether a higher number of 
      expansion repeats leads to greater GABAergic impairment warrants further study.

TI  - Insights into the Genetic Profile of Two Siblings Affected by Unverricht-Lundborg 
      Disease Using Patient-Derived hiPSCs.
LID - 10.3390/cells11213491 [doi]
LID - 3491
AB  - Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD), also known as progressive myoclonic epilepsy 1 
      (EPM1), is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
      a complex symptomatology that includes action- and stimulus-sensitive myoclonus 
      and tonic-clonic seizures. The main cause of the onset and development of ULD is 
      a repeat expansion of a dodecamer sequence localized in the promoter region of 
      the gene encoding cystatin B (CSTB), an inhibitor of lysosomal proteases. 
      Although this is the predominant mutation found in most patients, the 
      physio-pathological mechanisms underlying the disease complexity remain largely 
      unknown. In this work, we used patient-specific iPSCs and their neuronal 
      derivatives to gain insight into the molecular and genetic machinery responsible 
      for the disease in two Italian siblings affected by different phenotypes of ULD. 
      Specifically, fragment length analysis on amplified CSTB promoters found 
      homozygous status for dodecamer expansion in both patients and showed that the 
      number of dodecamer repeats is the same in both. Furthermore, the luciferase 
      reporter assay showed that the CSTB promoter activity was similarly reduced in 
      both lines compared to the control. This information allowed us to draw important 
      conclusions: (1) the phenotypic differences of the patients do not seem to be 
      strictly dependent on the genetic mutation around the CSTB gene, and (2) that 
      some other molecular mechanisms, not yet clearly identified, might be taken into 
      account. In line with the inhibitory role of cystatin B on cathepsins, molecular 
      investigations performed on iPSCs-derived neurons showed an increased expression 
      of lysosomal cathepsins (B, D, and L) and a reduced expression of CSTB protein. 
      Intriguingly, the increase in cathepsin expression does not appear to be 
      correlated with the residual amount of CSTB, suggesting that other mechanisms, in 
      addition to the regulation of cathepsins, could be involved in the pathological 
      complexity of the disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hearing loss is a highly prevalent condition in the pediatric 
      population. Pediatric maxillary expansion is a widespread treatment to address 
      transverse maxillary deficiency. First reports describing an association between 
      improvements for patients with HL and PME initiated in the 1960s. In this 
      systematic review and meta-analysis we aim to review the role of maxillary 
      expansion in reducing conductive hearing loss in pediatric population. REVIEW 
      METHODS: Pubmed (Medline), the Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Trip Database were 
      checked. Main outcome was expressed as the difference between air-bone gap, 
      compliance, ear volume and conductive hearing thresholds before and after 
      treatment and the 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies (218 
      patients) met inclusion criteria. The pooled data in the meta-analysis under a 
      random effects model shows a statistically significant difference of 10.57dB mean 
      reduction after palatal expansion. The air-bone gap was significantly reduced by 
      5.39dB (CI 95% 3.68, 7.10). Compliance and volume were assessed in three studies, 
      with a non-significant positive difference in the compliance (0.14) and a 
      statistically significant difference for volume (0.80) after palatal expansion. 
      CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis found a positive effect of 
      pediatric maxillary expansion in conductive hearing loss in well-select children. 
      However, results cannot be extrapolated for children with conductive hearing loss 
      without an accompanying orthodontic indication (maxillary constriction). It 
      showed that the existing prospective studies exhibited qualitative pitfalls, 
      limiting the ability to obtain conclusive evidence about the role of pediatric 
      maxillary expansion on conductive hearing loss in children.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD) is a common type of 
      progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME). It is caused mostly by biallelic dodecamer 
      repeat expansions in the promoter region of CSTB gene. Despite highly prevalent 
      in the Mediterranean countries, no studies have been reported from Egypt. This 
      article study the presence of CSTB gene mutations among Egyptian patients 
      clinically suspected with ULD, and describes the clinical and genetic 
      characteristics of those with confirmed gene mutation. METHODS: Medical records 
      of patients following up in two specialized epilepsy clinics in Cairo, Egypt were 
      retrospectively reviewed. Twenty patients who belonged to 13 unrelated families 
      were provisionally diagnosed with ULD based on the clinical presentation. Genetic 
      testing was done. Clinical characteristics, demographic data and EEG findings 
      were documented. RESULTS: Genetic studies confirmed the presence of the CSTB 
      dodecamer repeat expansion in 14 patients from 8 families (frequency 70 %). The 
      mean duration of the follow-up was 5 years. Male to female distribution was 1:1 
      with a mean age of onset 9.7 years. Consanguinity was noted in 4 families. Eight 
      patients had their first seizure between the age of 10 and 20 years. Myoclonic 
      jerks ranged in severity from mild in three unrelated patients to severe in one. 
      Only 3 had cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the presence of 
      CSTB mutation among Egyptian patients suspected with ULD. There was no clear 
      phenotype-genotype correlation among the studied group of patients. In addition, 
      we noticed variable inter and intra familial severity among patients from the 
      same family.

AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to explore genetic findings and the 
      phenotype in Polish patients with Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD). MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated mutations in the cystatin B (CSTB) gene 
      and clinical presentation in a cohort of patients with ULD. The study population 
      consisted of 19 (14 males) patients with genetically confirmed disease. RESULTS: 
      Sixteen patients were homozygous for the expanded dodecamer repeat mutation 
      alleles, one subject was compound heterozygous for the dodecamer repeat expansion 
      and other mutation, in two, the type of mutation has not yet been established. 
      The numbers of repeats in the CSTB gene varied from 60 to 81. Clinical 
      information was available for 16 subjects. The disease course was progressive in 
      all patients, leading to severe disability, mainly due to myoclonus, in nine. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Genetic findings and the clinical picture 
      of our patients with ULD were in accordance with available studies. The most 
      common genetic defect underlying ULD was homozygosity for an unstable expansion 
      of a dodecamer repeat in the CSTB gene. Patients with action or/and stimulus 
      sensitive myoclonus or intractable myoclonus epilepsy, especially with onset in 
      late childhood/adolescence should be screened for ULD.

AB  - Acid ceramidase deficiency is an orphan lysosomal disorder caused by ASAH1 
      pathogenic variants and presenting with either Farber disease or spinal muscle 
      atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMA-PME). Phenotypic and genotypic 
      features are rarely explored beyond the scope of case reports. Furthermore, the 
      new biomarker C26-Ceramide requires validation in a clinical setting. We 
      evaluated the clinical, biomarker and genetic spectrum of 15 Egyptian children 
      from 14 unrelated families with biallelic pathogenic variants in ASAH1 (12 Farber 
      and 3 SMA-PME). Recruited children were nine females/six males ranging in age at 
      diagnosis from 13 to 118 months. We detected ASAH1 pathogenic variants in all 30 
      alleles including three novel variants (c.1126A>G (p.Thr376Ala), c.1205G>A 
      (p.Arg402Gln), exon-5-deletion). Both total C26-Ceramide and its trans- isomer 
      showed 100% sensitivity for the detection of ASAH1-related disorders in tested 
      patients. A 10-year-old girl with the novel variant c.1205G>A (p.Arg402Gln) 
      presented with a new peculiar phenotype of PME without muscle atrophy. We 
      expanded the phenotypic spectrum of ASAH1-related disorders and validated the 
      biomarker C26-Ceramide for supporting diagnosis in symptomatic patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The progressive myoclonic epilepsies (PME) are a heterogeneous group 
      of disorders in which a specific diagnosis cannot be made in a subset of 
      patients, despite exhaustive investigation. C9orf72 repeat expansions are 
      emerging as an important causal factor in several adult-onset neurodegenerative 
      disorders, in particular frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis. An association with PME has not been reported previously. 
      OBJECTIVE: To identify the causative mutation in a Belgian family where the 
      proband had genetically unexplained PME. RESULTS: We report a 33-year old woman 
      who had epilepsy since the age of 15 and then developed progressive cognitive 
      deterioration and multifocal myoclonus at the age of 18. The family history 
      suggested autosomal dominant inheritance of psychiatric disorders, epilepsy, and 
      dementia. Thorough workup for PME including whole exome sequencing did not reveal 
      an underlying cause, but a C9orf72 repeat expansion was found in our patient and 
      affected relatives. Brain biopsy confirmed the presence of characteristic 
      p62-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions. CONCLUSION: C9orf72 mutation 
      analysis should be considered in patients with PME and psychiatric disorders or 
      dementia, even when the onset is in late childhood or adolescence.

TI  - No evidence of a role for cystatin B gene in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.
PG  - e40-3

AB  - Genetic factors play a major role in the etiology of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy 
      (JME), a common form of idiopathic generalized epilepsy, but so far, genes 
      related to JME remain largely unknown. JME shares electroclinical features with 
      Unverricht-Lundborg disease (progressive myoclonic epilepsy type 1; EPM1), a form 
      of progressive myoclonus epilepsy characterized by myoclonus, epilepsy, and 
      gradual neurologic deterioration. EPM1 is caused by mutations in the gene that 
      codes for cystatin B (CSTB), an inhibitor of cysteine protease. In the present 
      study, we wished to investigate the role of the CSTB gene in patients with JME. 
      Fifty-seven unrelated patients (35 women; mean age +/- standard deviation [SD], 
      24.1 +/- 7.7; mean age +/- SD at onset, 15.3 +/- 2.4) with JME were enrolled. 
      Twenty-three of 57 patients were the probands of families with JME. The molecular 
      diagnosis was carried out to identify the common dodecamer repeat expansion 
      mutation or other disease-causing mutations in the CSTB gene. The molecular 
      analysis did not depict mutations in any of the 57 patients with JME. Our study 
      did not support a role for the CSTB gene in patients with familial or sporadic 
      JME.

TI  - A shared haplotype indicates a founder event in Unverricht-Lundborg disease

LID - 10.3109/00207454.2013.828723 [doi]
AB  - Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by 
      dodecamer repeat expansion in the promoter region of the cystatin B (CSTB) gene 
      in approximately 90% of the disease alleles worldwide. This study presents 
      results of genetic findings in four Serbian unrelated patients with clinical and 
      molecular diagnosis of ULD. Using newly established PCR protocol with betaine, we 
      detected a homozygous expansion of dodecamer repeats in the CSTB gene in four 
      patients with clinical diagnosis of ULD. Our results are in agreement with 
      previous studies showing that dodecamer repeats expansion is the most common 
      mutation associated with ULD. Haplotype analysis of eight unrelated ULD 
      chromosomes was performed using seven markers flanking CSTB gene and one 
      intragenic variant. We demonstrated the existence of a founder effect, strongly 
      supported by LD calculations. Size of the minimal common haplotype implies that 
      the most recent common ancestor of the Serbian ULD patients lived about 110 
      generations ago. We showed that Serbian ULD patients share the same common 
      ancestor with patients from Baltic countries and North Africa. In the light of 
      our data, we proposed extended minimal common haplotype, which could be 
      considered as initial haplotype of the founder event common for Serbian, Baltic, 
      and North African ULD patients.

TI  - Rapid detection of large expansions in progressive myoclonus epilepsy type 1, 
      myotonic dystrophy type 2 and spinocerebellar ataxia type 8.
PG  - 113-20
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Human genetic disorders associated with multiple unstable 
      repeats resulting in long DNA expansions are difficult to identify by 
      conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in routine molecular testing, and 
      therefore require time-consuming hybridisation. To improve and expedite the 
      diagnostic methods for progressive myoclonus epilepsy (EPM1), myotonic dystrophy 
      2 (DM2) and spinocerebellar ataxia 8 (SCA8) caused by dynamic mutations, we 
      adapted a repeat primed PCR (RP-PCR) assay which was previously developed for 
      testing of other triplet repeat disorders. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The new 
      algorithm for molecular analysis was to run a standard PCR to yield alleles in an 
      amplifiable range and then run a RP-PCR to detect larger expansions. 
      Electrophoresis and visualisation of PCR products on an automatic sequencer were 
      applied to determine normal and pathogenic alleles comprising (C4GC4GCG)n in EPM1 
      in 44 subjects, (CCTG)n in DM2 in 76 individuals and (CTG)n in SCA8 in 378 
      patients. RESULTS: The protocol combining conventional PCR and RP-PCR proved to 
      be a rapid and reliable test to diagnose the above named disorders. Among 44 
      individuals tested for EPM1, two expanded alleles were identified in 7 patients. 
      Out of 76 apparently homozygous subjects, RP-PCR allowed us to detect 56 
      expansions specific to DM2, and out of 378 ataxia patients, a large allele of the 
      ATXN8OS gene (SCA8) was found in 25 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Here, for the first 
      time, we report detection of large expansions in EPM1 and SCA8 patients. This 
      RP-PCR assay is high throughput, reproducible and sensitive enough to be 
      successfully used for diagnostic purposes.

TI  - Severer phenotype in Unverricht-Lundborg disease (EPM1) patients compound 
      heterozygous for the dodecamer repeat expansion and the c.202C>T mutation in the 
      CSTB gene.
PG  - 515-22
LID - 10.1159/000323470 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Unverricht-Lundborg disease (EPM1) is caused by mutations in the 
      cystatin B (CSTB) gene. Most patients are homozygous for the expanded dodecamer 
      repeat mutation alleles, but 9 other EPM1-associated mutations have also been 
      identified. We describe the clinical, cognitive and imaging characteristics of 5 
      Finnish EPM1 patients who are compound heterozygous for the dodecamer repeat 
      expansion and the c.202C>T mutations. METHODS: Five compound heterozygous 
      patients and 21 patients homozygous for the expansion mutation, participating in 
      an ongoing nationwide clinical and molecular genetics study, were evaluated using 
      the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale test and comprehensive neuropsychological 
      testing. All patients underwent MR imaging. The MR data were also compared with 
      those of 24 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: Age at onset of symptoms was 
      significantly lower in the compound heterozygotes than in the homozygous EPM1 
      patients. They also had severer myoclonus and drug-resistant tonic-clonic 
      seizures. Moreover, they had lower cognitive performance. In MRI a voxel-based 
      morphometry analysis of primary and premotor cortex, supplementary motor cortex 
      and thalami revealed gray matter volume loss when compared with the healthy 
      controls, similar to patients homozygous for the expansion mutation. CONCLUSION: 
      Patients compound heterozygous for the dodecamer repeat expansion and the 
      c.202C>T mutations seem to have a severer form of EPM1 than patients homozygous 
      for the expansion mutation. These findings have implications for counseling of 
      EPM1 patients with different genetic defects.

      Unverricht-Lundborg disease (EPM1).
PG  - 65-71

AB  - PURPOSE: Unverricht-Lundborg disease (EPM1) is the most common form of 
      progressive myoclonus epilepsies. The genetic background is a homozygous 
      dodecamer repeat extension mutation in the cystatin B (CSTB) gene. However, 
      mutations occurring in a compound heterozygous form with the expansion mutation 
      have also been reported. In Finland, we have found five EPM1 patients compound 
      heterozygous for the dodecamer repeat expansion and the c.202C>T mutation in the 
      CSTB gene (chEPM1). There are no previous clinical or neurophysiological studies 
      on these patients. Thus, we aimed to characterize possible functional alterations 
      in primary motor cortical areas. METHODS: Five chEPM1 patients were compared with 
      homozygous patients and healthy controls. All patients underwent a clinical 
      evaluation to characterize the severity of the symptoms. Navigated transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to study cortical excitability by determining 
      the motor thresholds (MT), silent periods (SP) and motor evoked potential (MEP) 
      characteristics. Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during the 
      measurements. Voxel-based MRI morphometry (VBM) was used to study differences in 
      gray matter volume. RESULTS: The chEPM1 patients exhibited an inhibitory cortical 
      tonus reflected as elevated MTs and prolonged SPs. EEG showed spontaneous focal 
      epileptiform activity in centro-temporal and parietal areas in addition to more 
      widespread and generalized discharges. VBM revealed loss of gray matter volume in 
      primary motor cortical areas and thalami. DISCUSSION: The chEPM1 patients 
      exhibited functional and structural changes in primary motor cortical areas. The 
      functional changes are more profound as compared to homozygous patients, 
      suggesting a neurophysiological background for the more severe clinical symptoms.

TI  - Unverricht-Lundborg progressive myoclonus epilepsy in Oman.
PG  - 252-5
LID - 10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2007.11.006 [doi]
AB  - We analyzed the clinical, electrophysiologic, and genetic features of Omani Arab 
      patients suspected of manifesting the Unverricht-Lundborg form of progressive 
      myoclonus epilepsy. Ten patients (five boys, five girls; mean age at onset, 10.2 
      years) were evaluated. Unverricht-Lundborg disease was confirmed in all by 
      detection of dodecamer repeat expansion mutations in the EPM1 gene. There was no 
      correlation between age at onset or severity of disease with sizes of dodecamer 
      repeats. Myoclonic seizures were the presenting symptom in 70% of patients. 
      Myoclonus was severe in adolescence, but remained stable or improved beyond 5-6 
      years of disease onset. No significant cognitive decline occurred. Nearly 75% of 
      patients exhibited mild to moderate cerebellar dysfunction, which was 
      nonprogressive after adulthood. Slowing of background activity, generalized 
      spike-wave discharges, and photoparoxysmal responses were evident in all 
      patients' electroencephalograms. Spike-wave discharges and photoparoxysmal 
      responses tended to disappear in adulthood. This cluster of progressive myoclonus 
      epilepsy patients manifested typical Unverricht-Lundborg disease. All cases had 
      mutations in EPM1, the known gene for this disorder, and therefore do not 
      contribute to identifying the gene in a second Unverricht-Lundborg disease locus 
      recently mapped in Arab patients from Israel. Although Unverricht-Lundborg 
      disease is very severe in adolescence, its clinical signs stabilize and improve 
      somewhat in adulthood in this so-called "progressive epilepsy."

TI  - Cystatin B: mutation detection, alternative splicing and expression in 
      progressive myclonus epilepsy of Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1) patients.
PG  - 185-93
AB  - Progressive myoclonus epilepsy of Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1) is an autosomal 
      recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the cystatin B gene 
      (CSTB) that encodes an inhibitor of several lysosomal cathepsins. An unstable 
      expansion of a dodecamer repeat in the CSTB promoter accounts for the majority of 
      EPM1 disease alleles worldwide. We here describe a novel PCR protocol for 
      detection of the dodecamer repeat expansion. We describe two novel 
      EPM1-associated mutations, c.149G > A leading to the p.G50E missense change and 
      an intronic 18-bp deletion (c.168+1_18del), which affects splicing of CSTB. The 
      p.G50E mutation that affects the conserved QVVAG amino acid sequence critical for 
      cathepsin binding fails to associate with lysosomes. This further supports the 
      previously implicated physiological importance of the CSTB-lysosome association. 
      Expression of CSTB mRNA and protein was markedly reduced in lymphoblastoid cells 
      of the patients irrespective of the mutation type. Patients homozygous for the 
      dodecamer expansion mutation showed 5-10% expression compared to controls. By 
      combining database searches with RT-PCR we identified several alternatively 
      spliced CSTB isoforms. One of these, CSTB2, was also present in mouse and was 
      analyzed in more detail. In real-time PCR quantification, CSTB2 expression was 
      less than 5% of total CSTB expression in all human adult and fetal tissues 
      analyzed. In patients homozygous for the minisatellite mutation, the level of 
      CSTB2 was reduced similarly to that of CSTB implicating regulation from the same 
      promoter. The physiological significance of CSTB2 remains to be determined.

TI  - Polymerase chain reaction-based analysis using deaminated DNA of dodecamer 
      expansions in CSTB, associated with Unverricht-Lundborg myoclonus epilepsy.
PG  - 328-33
AB  - Progressive myoclonus epilepsy of the Unverricht-Lundborg type is an autosomal 
      recessive disorder that is characterized clinically by myoclonic seizures and 
      ataxia. The majority of affected individuals carry repeat expansions of a 
      dodecamer in the promoter region of the cystatin B gene. The unusually high GC 
      content of this tract is refractory to conventional polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR), and, as a result, a circumventive procedure involving the deamination of 
      DNA with sodium bisulfite has been proposed. This study evaluates the 
      effectiveness of this deamination modification for the detection of dodecamer 
      repeat variants. An analysis of 258 healthy Japanese individuals revealed an 
      allele with four copies of the dodecamer repeat with a frequency of 0.01, in 
      addition to the more commonly observed two and three copy repeat alleles. 
      Homozygous repeat expansions 600 and 680 base pairs in length were detected in 
      the analyses of two affected individuals. For these cases, sequencing, along with 
      an alternative PCR-stutter formation, revealed 41 and 48 copies, respectively, of 
      the dodecamer repeat. The complete conversion of C to T was observed in the 
      expanded tracts, indicating that no methylation occurred at the CpG sites. Based 
      on these results, it was concluded that the use of deaminated DNA allows for a 
      precise analysis of consecutive GC tracts.

TI  - Loss of lysosomal association of cystatin B proteins representing progressive 
      myoclonus epilepsy, EPM1, mutations.
PG  - 208-15
AB  - Loss-of-function mutations in the cystatin B (CSTB), a cysteine protease 
      inhibitor, gene underlie progressive myoclonus epilepsy of Unverricht-Lundborg 
      type (EPM1), characterized by myoclonic and tonic-clonic seizures, ataxia and a 
      progressive course. A minisatellite repeat expansion in the promoter region of 
      the CSTB gene is the most common mutation in EPM1 patients and leads to reduced 
      mRNA levels. Seven other mutations altering the structure of CSTB, or predicting 
      altered splicing, have been described. Using a novel monoclonal CSTB antibody and 
      organelle-specific markers in human primary myoblasts, we show here that 
      endogenous CSTB localizes not only to the nucleus and cytoplasm but also 
      associates with lysosomes. Upon differentiation to myotubes, CSTB becomes 
      excluded from the nucleus and lysosomes, suggesting that the subcellular 
      distribution of CSTB is dependent on the differentiation status of the cell. Four 
      patient mutations altering the CSTB polypeptide were transiently expressed in 
      BHK-21 cells. The p.Lys73fsX2-truncated mutant protein shows diffuse cytoplasmic 
      and nuclear distribution, whereas p.Arg68X is rapidly degraded. Two missense 
      mutations, the previously described p.Gly4Arg affecting the highly conserved 
      glycine, critical for cathepsin binding, and a novel mutation, p.Gln71Pro, fail 
      to associate with lysosomes. These data imply an important lysosome-associated 
      physiological function for CSTB and suggest that loss of this association 
      contributes to the molecular pathogenesis of EPM1.

TI  - DNA deamination enables direct PCR amplification of the cystatin B (CSTB) 
      gene-associated dodecamer repeat expansion in myoclonus epilepsy type 
      Unverricht-Lundborg.
PG  - 404-8
AB  - The Unverricht-Lundborg type of progressive myoclonus epilepsy (EPM1) is an 
      autosomal recessive disorder that is caused by the dysfunction of the cystatin B 
      (CSTB) gene product. In the vast majority of affected cases, mRNA transcription 
      is impaired by a biallelic expansion of a dodecamer repeat within the 
      5'-untranslated region of the respective gene. Since this minisatellite contains 
      exclusively G and C nucleotides, direct PCR analysis of allele expansion is 
      extremely difficult and error prone. To circumvent these problems, we have 
      developed a PCR assay that is based on the deamination of the DNA prior to 
      amplification. We have developed a method based on PCR after DNA deamination of 
      the GC-rich repeat region, which improves the PCR condition to such an extent 
      that we were not only able to reliably amplify expanded alleles of affected 
      individuals (homozygotes and compound heterozygotes), but also the two alleles of 
      full mutation carriers, whose analysis is particularly difficult because of PCR 
      bias and heteroduplex formation between the two alleles. We used promoter- and 
      repeat-specific primer combinations to investigate whether dodecamer repeat 
      expansion concurs with de novo methylation of the CSTB gene promoter in a similar 
      fashion to other repeat expansion syndromes. We confirmed previous evidence 
      obtained by HpaII digestion and Southern blot analysis that both the promoter and 
      the repeat regions are unmethylated, in both healthy and affected individuals. 
      Thus, in contrast to certain trinucleotide repeat expansion-associated diseases, 
      such as fragile X syndrome (FRAXA) and myotonic dystrophy, methylation analyses 
      can not be utilized for indirect diagnostic testing.

TI  - FOunder effect in patients with Unverricht-Lundborg disease on reunion island.
PG  - 1357-60
AB  - PURPOSE: Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD) is the most frequent form of 
      progressive myoclonus epilepsy. ULD is caused mostly by a homozygous expansion of 
      a dodecamer repeat in the cystatin B gene (CSTB) promoter. We present here a 
      clinical and molecular study of 14 ULD patients originating from Reunion Island, 
      a French island in the Indian Ocean. METHODS: These ULD patients were clinically 
      evaluated, and the diagnosis of ULD was confirmed molecularly. We analyzed 12 
      microsatellites flanking CSTB and estimated the date of introduction of the ULD 
      mutation on Reunion Island. RESULTS: These cases were clinically very similar, 
      with the typical myoclonus syndrome associated with generalized tonic-clonic 
      seizures, cerebellar involvement and, in some cases, mild mental deterioration. 
      The mean age at onset was 9.6 years (range, 5-14 years), and the mean disease 
      duration was 27 years (range, 5-47 years). The 14 patients harbored the typical 
      ULD mutation, with variable degrees of expansion (mean of 56.3 repeats; range, 
      49-63). A founder effect was detected, with all but one of the Reunion ULD 
      chromosomes displaying expansions belonging to the same haplotype, 1-1-1-2-6-4-3. 
      We estimated the date of arrival of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of 
      these patients on Reunion Island to the middle of the eighteenth century. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These Reunion ULD patients displayed a homogeneous phenotype. Our 
      molecular results are compatible with the instability of the repeat expansion and 
      revealed a founder effect in Reunion ULD patients and the existence of a MRCA 
      about 12 generations ago.

TI  - Haplotype study of West European and North African Unverricht-Lundborg 
      chromosomes: evidence for a few founder mutations.
PG  - 255-62
AB  - Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD) is a progressive myoclonus epilepsy common in 
      Finland and North Africa, and less common in Western Europe. ULD is mostly caused 
      by expansion of a dodecamer repeat in the cystatin B gene ( CSTB) promoter. We 
      performed a haplotype study of ULD chromosomes (ULDc) with the repeat expansion. 
      We included 48 West European Caucasian (WEC) and 47 North African (NA) ULDc. We 
      analysed eight markers flanking CSTB(GT10-D21S1890-D21S1885-D21S2040-D21S1259- 
      CSTB-D21S1912-PFKL-D21S171) and one intragenic variant in the CSTB 3' UTR 
      (A2575G). We observed a founder effect in most of the NA ULD patients, as 61.7% 
      of the NA ULDc (29/47) shared the same haplotype, A1 (1-1-A-1-6-7), for markers 
      D21S1885-D21S2040-A2575G-D21S1259-D21S1912-PFKL. Moreover, if we considered only 
      the markers D21S1885, D21S2040, A2575G and D21S1259, 43 of the 47 NA ULDc shared 
      the same alleles 1-1-A-1, haplotype A. As previously shown, the WEC ULDc were 
      heterogeneous. However, the Baltic haplotype, A3 (5-1-1-A-1-1), was observed in 
      ten WEC ULDc (20.8%) and the CSTB 3'UTR variant, which we called the Alps 
      variant, was observed in 17 ULDc (35.4%). Finally, as almost all NA patients, 
      like Scandinavian patients, were of the haplotype A, we assumed that there was an 
      ancient common founder effect in NA and Baltic ULD patients. We estimated that 
      the putative most recent common ancestral ULD carrier with this haplotype A must 
      have existed about 2,500 years ago (100-150 generations). Finally, this work 
      provides evidence for the existence of only a small number of founder mutations 
      in ULD.

TI  - Molecular dynamics studies of trinucleotide repeat DNA involved in 
      neurodegenerative disorders.
PG  - 479-95
AB  - Expansion of trinucleotide repeat DNA of the classes CAG-CTG, CGG-CCG and GAA-TTC 
      are found to be associated with several neurodegenerative disorders. Different 
      mechanisms have been attributed to the expansion of triplets, mainly involving 
      the formation of alternate secondary structures by such repeats. This paper 
      reports the molecular dynamics simulation of triplet repeat DNA sequences to 
      study the basic structural features of DNA that are responsible for the formation 
      of structures such as hairpins and slip-strand DNA leading to expansion. All the 
      triplet repeat sequences studied were found to be more flexible compared to the 
      control sequence unassociated with disease. Moreover, flexibility was found to be 
      in the order CAG-CTG > CGG-CCG approximately GAA-TTC, the highly flexible CAG-CTG 
      repeat being the most common cause of neurodegenerative disorders. In another 
      simulation, a single G-C to T-A mutation at the 9th position of the CAG-CTG 
      repeat exhibited a reduction in bending compared to the pure 15-mer CAG-CTG 
      repeat. EPM1 dodecamer repeat associated with the pathogenesis of progressive 
      myoclonus epilepsy was also simulated and showed flexible nature suggesting a 
      similar expansion mechanism.

TI  - Progressive myoclonus epilepsy [EPM1] repeat d(CCCCGCCCCGCG)n forms folded 
      hairpin structures at physiological pH.
PG  - 293-305
AB  - The secondary structure of DNA has been shown to be an important component in the 
      mechanism of expansion of the trinucleotide repeats that are associated with many 
      neurodegenerative disorders. Recently, expansion of a dodecamer repeat, 
      (CCCCGCCCCGCG)n upstream of cystatin B gene has been shown to be the most common 
      mutation associated with Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy (EPM1) of 
      Unverricht-Lundborg type. We have investigated structure of oligonucleotides 
      containing one, two and three copies of the EPM1 repeat sequences at 
      physiological pH. CD spectra and anomalous faster gel electrophoretic mobilty 
      indicates formation of intramolecularly folded structures that are formed 
      independent of concentration. Hydroxylamine probing allowed us to identify the C 
      residues that are involved in C.G base pairing. P1 nuclease studies elucidated 
      the presence of unpaired regions in the folded back structures. UV melting 
      studies show biphasic melting curves for the oligonucleotides containing two and 
      three EPM1 repeats. Our data suggests multiple hairpin structures for two and 
      three repeat containing oligonucleotides. In this paper we show that 
      oligonucleotides containing EPM1 repeat adopt secondary structures that may 
      facilitate strand slippage thereby causing the expansion.

TI  - Unverricht-Lundborg disease in a five-generation Arab family: instability of 
      dodecamer repeats.
PG  - 1050-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD) is the prototypical form of 
      progressive myoclonus epilepsy, and subjects are usually very photosensitive. ULD 
      is caused by mutations in the cystatin B (CSTB) gene; the most common mutation is 
      expansion of a dodecamer repeat near the promoter. The authors studied a 
      five-generation Arab family with ULD lacking photosensitivity. METHODS: An Arab 
      family from the Galilee region of Israel with progressive myoclonus epilepsy was 
      clinically evaluated. Blood samples were obtained from three living affected and 
      16 unaffected individuals. Expansion of dodecamer repeat in the CSTB gene was 
      examined. RESULTS: The three living affected individuals showed spontaneous and 
      action myoclonus, ataxia, and mild dementia. EEG in two individuals showed 
      generalized polyspike-wave without photosensitivity. The family structure with 
      large sibships and multiple consanguineous loops allowed the authors to examine 
      the gene over four generations of adults. The three living affected individuals 
      were homozygous for repeat expansions and 11 of the 16 unaffected family members 
      were heterozygous. Instability was demonstrated by the presence of expansions of 
      different sizes occurring on the same haplotype background in this inbred family. 
      Fragment size variations could be unequivocally detected in two sibships. The 
      expansions were in the 49 to 54 dodecamer repeat range. Changes in one generation 
      were small, 1 to 4 repeat units, consisting of either enlargements or 
      contractions. CONCLUSIONS: Instability of the expanded dodecamer repeats in the 
      cystatin B gene is frequent. Almost invariably, a small change is observed in 
      parent-child transmission. The lack of photosensitivity in this family is 
      unexplained.

TI  - Juvenile Huntington's disease presenting as progressive myoclonic epilepsy.
PG  - 708-11
AB  - A 9-year-old girl, who had no family history of neurologic diseases in the 
      first-degree relatives, had a 3-year history of progressive myoclonus epilepsy 
      (PME). A thorough laboratory investigation was normal. As two sisters of her 
      paternal grandmother were said to have Huntington's disease (HD), the authors 
      looked for HD and found a CAG repeat expansion of 115 repeats. This diagnosis 
      should be considered in addition to other causes in patients with PME. Moreover, 
      the current case further supports the notion that HD should be considered even 
      when a family history is not obvious.

TI  - Tetraplex formation by the progressive myoclonus epilepsy type-1 repeat: 
      implications for instability in the repeat expansion diseases.
PG  - 184-7
AB  - The repeat expansion diseases are a group of genetic disorders resulting from an 
      increase in size or expansion of a specific array of tandem repeats. It has been 
      suggested that DNA secondary structures are responsible for this expansion. If 
      this is so, we would expect that all unstable repeats should form such 
      structures. We show here that the unstable repeat that causes progressive 
      myoclonus epilepsy type-1 (EPM1), like the repeats associated with other diseases 
      in this category, forms a variety of secondary structures. However, EPM1 is 
      unique in that tetraplexes are the only structures likely to form in long 
      unpaired repeat tracts under physiological conditions.

TI  - A patient with 2 different repeat expansion mutations.
PG  - 1199-203
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many inherited progressive encephalopathies have a poor outcome, and 
      some are caused by repeat expansion mutations. How would the presence of 2 
      different expansion mutations affect the phenotype? OBJECTIVE: To describe a 
      patient who has 2 distinct, rare genetic disorders: myotonic dystrophy (DM, OMIM 
      160900) and progressive myoclonus epilepsy of the Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1, 
      OMIM 254800). Both conditions are caused by repeat expansion mutations. They 
      affect the central nervous system causing mental retardation, but also produce a 
      wide spectrum of disabilities in daily living. SETTING: Referral center. METHODS: 
      Clinical description with accompanying photographs, electroencephalography and 
      magnetic resonance imaging; DNA analysis of both of the mutations and chromosomal 
      analysis with prometaphase spreads. RESULTS: The patient had clinical 
      characteristics and findings of both myotonic dystrophy and progressive myoclonus 
      epilepsy of the Unverricht-Lundborg type. Electroencephalographic recordings over 
      a 3-year period showed typical findings for myoclonus epilepsy. The patient had 
      no gross anomalies in brain magnetic resonance imaging. She had a normal 
      karyotype, and both of the diagnoses were confirmed at the molecular level with 
      the direct detection of the mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Despite having 2 different 
      progressive inherited disorders affecting the central nervous system, the 
      patient, at age 28 years, showed only mild mental retardation with very slow 
      progression. However, clear deterioration in activities of daily living has taken 
      place during last 3 years. Arch Neurol. 2000;57:1199-1203

TI  - Characterization of the cystatin B gene promoter harboring the dodecamer repeat 
      expanded in progressive myoclonus epilepsy, EPM1.
PG  - 65-73
AB  - Mutations in the gene encoding cystatin B (CSTB) are responsible for the primary 
      defect in progressive myoclonus epilepsy of Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1). A 
      novel and unique type of disease-causing mutation, an unstable dodecamer repeat 
      expansion, accounts for the majority of EPM1 patients world-wide. This 
      minisatellite repeat expansion, located in the putative promoter of CSTB 175 bp 
      upstream from the translation initiation codon, appears to downregulate CSTB gene 
      expression in vivo. We report here the characterization of the CSTB promoter 
      using different promoter-luciferase gene constructs. Transient transfections of 
      cultured mammalian cells suggest that the region from -670 to -1 bp from the 
      translation initiation codon functions as the CSTB promoter. Active binding to 
      five Sp1 and four AP1 sites as well as weak binding to an androgen response 
      element (ARE) half site was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift 
      assays. The effect of the minisatellite expansion on the promoter activity was 
      evaluated by comparing the activity of constructs containing wild-type and 
      expanded alleles. An increase in the number of dodecamer units from three to 19 
      repeats lowered transcription in vitro by 10-fold. Northern analysis of 
      lymphoblastoid RNA from individuals with 'premutation' length dodecamer repeat 
      (12-17 copies) expansions showed decreased levels of CSTB mRNA expression. These 
      data indicate that expansion of the dodecamer repeat located in the proximal 
      promoter of CSTB severely disrupts the function of the promoter and thereby 
      reduces transcription of CSTB.

PG  - 218
AB  - Mutations in the cystatin B (CSTB) gene underlie progressive myoclonus epilepsy 
      of Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1) (Pennacchio et al., 1996). We previously 
      described an unstable minisatellite expansion mutation in the putative promoter 
      region of CSTB that accounts for the majority of EPM1 patients. Sequencing of a 
      genomic lambda clone, generated from a Finnish EPM1 patient homozygous for an 
      enlarged restriction fragment, revealed a 15- to 18-mer minisatellite repeat 
      expansion (Virtaneva et al., 1997). Later, sequencing of plasmid clones generated 
      from Swiss and French patients revealed a dodecamer repeat expansion (Lalioti et 
      al., 1997a). By restriction enzyme analysis of our original patient clone and a 
      clone generated from an Italian patient, we now show that the expansion is 
      neither a 15-mer nor an 18-mer contrary to our initial results. Moreover, direct 
      sequencing of the Finnish patient clone with Pfu exo polymerase confirmed that 
      the expanded repeat is a dodecamer. Based on this finding and additional 
      experiments, we suggest that the discrepancy between the two studies was due to 
      errors caused by the combination of native Pfu polymerase and modified guanosine 
      deaza-7-dGTP used in the PCR reaction.

TI  - Differences in evoked potential characteristics between DRPLA patients and 
      patients with progressive myoclonic epilepsy: preliminary findings indicating 
      usefulness for differential diagnosis.
PG  - 3-11
AB  - The characteristics of evoked potentials in patients with 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) were investigated. Twelve patients 
      with DRPLA and three patients with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) 
      attributable to other causes participated in the study. In 11 out of the 12 
      patients, the diagnosis of DRPLA was genetically confirmed, based on a 56-75 CAG 
      triplet repeat expansion on chromosome 12p; in the remaining patient, the 
      diagnosis was not genetically confirmed but the patient was clinically diagnosed 
      as having DRPLA and was within the same pedigree as one of the 11 genetically 
      confirmed patients. Two out of the three patients with PME, who had been tested 
      for dodecamer repeat expansion in the cystatin B gene, were genetically confirmed 
      as having Unverricht-Lundborg disease (UL); the remaining patient was also 
      clinically diagnosed as having UL, but the patient did not have the 
      aforementioned genetic abnormality. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and 
      brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAERs) were recorded. The amplitudes of the 
      SEPs were determined as the peak-to-peak amplitudes between P2 and N2 
      deflections. The results revealed that high-amplitude SEPs were not evoked in any 
      of the DRPLA patients; on the other hand, high-amplitude SEPs were evoked in all 
      the patients with UL. Moreover, BAERs were absent in seven out of the 12 patients 
      with DRPLA; on the other hand, all UL patients showed BAERs in which all peaks, 
      from I to V, were distinguishable. These results suggest differences in 
      pathophysiology between DRPLA, which predominantly affects the brainstem and 
      subcortical regions, and PME, characterized by cortical hyperexcitability. Thus, 
      evoked potential measurements may be useful to differentiate DRPLA patients from 
      those with progressive myoclonic epilepsy.

TI  - Altered spacing of promoter elements due to the dodecamer repeat expansion 
      contributes to reduced expression of the cystatin B gene in EPM1.
PG  - 1791-8
AB  - Progressive myoclonus epilepsy of the Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1; MIM 254800) 
      is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by seizures, myoclonus and 
      progression to cerebellar ataxia. EPM1 arises due to mutations in the cystatin B 
      (CSTB) gene which encodes a cysteine proteinase inhibitor. Only a minority of 
      EPM1 alleles carry point mutations, while the majority contain large expansions 
      of the dodecamer CCCCGCCCCGCG repeat which is present at two to three copies in 
      normal individuals. The dodecamer repeat is located in the 5' flanking region of 
      the CSTB gene, presumably in its promoter. The pathological repeat expansion 
      results in a reduction in CSTB mRNA, which may be cell specific. To elucidate the 
      mechanism of this reduction of gene expression, we have studied the putative CSTB 
      promoter in vitro. A 3.8 kb fragment, containing the putative promoter with a 600 
      bp repeat expansion, showed a 2- to 4-fold reduction in luciferase activity 
      compared with an identical fragment with a normal repeat; this reduction was 
      observed only in certain cell types. Introduction of heterologous DNA fragments 
      of 730 and 1000 bp into the normal promoter, instead of the repeat expansion, 
      showed similarly reduced activity. Terminal deletions of the promoter implicate a 
      putative AP-1 binding site, upstream of the repeat, in CSTB transcription 
      activation. We propose that a novel mechanism of pathogenesis, the altering of 
      the spacing of transcription factor binding sites from each other and/or the 
      transcription initiation site due to repeat expansion, is among the causes of 
      reduction in CSTB expression and thus EPM1.

TI  - A PCR amplification method reveals instability of the dodecamer repeat in 
      progressive myoclonus epilepsy (EPM1) and no correlation between the size of the 
      repeat and age at onset.
PG  - 842-7
AB  - Progressive myoclonus epilepsy of the Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1) is a rare, 
      autosomal recessive disorder characterized by onset at age 6-16 years, 
      generalized seizures, incapacitating myoclonus, and variable progression to 
      cerebellar ataxia. The gene that causes EPM1, cystatin B, encodes a cysteine 
      proteinase inhibitor. Only a minority of EPM1 patients carry a point mutation 
      within the transcription unit. The majority of EPM1 alleles contain large 
      expansions of a dodecamer repeat, CCC CGC CCC GCG, located upstream of the 5' 
      transcription start site of the cystatin B gene; normal alleles contain two or 
      three copies of this repeat. All EPM1 alleles with an expansion were resistant to 
      standard PCR amplification. To precisely determine the size of the repeat in 
      affected individuals, we developed a detection protocol involving PCR 
      amplification and subsequent hybridization with an oligonucleotide containing the 
      repeat. The largest detected expansion was approximately 75 copies; the smallest 
      was approximately 30 copies. We identified affected siblings with repeat 
      expansions, of different sizes, on the same haplotype, which confirms the 
      repeat's instability during transmissions. Expansions were observed directly; 
      contractions were deduced by comparison of allele sizes within a family. In a 
      sample of 28 patients, we found no correlation between age at onset of EPM1 and 
      the size of the expanded dodecamer. This suggests that once the dodecamer repeat 
      expands beyond a critical threshold, cystatin B expression is reduced in certain 
      cells, with pathological consequences.

PG  - 847-51
AB  - Progressive myoclonus epilepsy of the Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1; MIM 254800) 
      is an autosomal recessive disorder with onset between 6 and 13 years followed by 
      variable progression to mental deterioration and cerebellar ataxia. It is a rare 
      disorder but more common in Finland (1 in 20,000) and the western Mediterranean. 
      Two point mutations in the cysteine proteinase inhibitor gene cystatin B (CSTB), 
      proved that this gene is responsible for EPM1 (ref. 3). An extensive search in 
      the CSTB gene revealed mutations accounting only for 14% of the 58 unrelated EPM1 
      alleles studied. Here we report that the majority of EPM1 alleles contain 
      expansions of a dodecamer (12-mer) repeat located about 70 nucleotides upstream 
      of the transcription start site nearest to the 5' end of the CSTB gene. Normal 
      alleles contain 2 or 3 copies of this repeat whereas mutant alleles contain more 
      than 60 such repeats and have reduced levels of CSTB messenger RNA in blood but 
      not in cell lines. 'Premutation' CSTB alleles with 12-17 repeats show marked 
      instability when transmitted to offspring.

TI  - Unstable minisatellite expansion causing recessively inherited myoclonus 
      epilepsy, EPM1.
PG  - 393-6
AB  - Progressive myoclonus epilepsy of Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1; MIM 254800) is 
      an autosomal recessive disorder that occurs with a low frequency in many 
      populations but is more common in Finland and the Mediterranean region. It is 
      characterized by stimulus-sensitive myoclonus and tonic-clonic seizures with 
      onset at age 6-15 years, typical electroencephalographic abnormalities and a 
      variable rate of progression between and within families. Following the initial 
      mapping of the EPM1 gene to chromosome 21 (ref. 6) and the refinement of the 
      critical region to a small interval, positional cloning identified the gene 
      encoding cystatin B (CST6), a cysteine protease inhibitor, as the gene underlying 
      EPM1 (ref. 10). Levels of messenger RNA encoded by CST6 were dramatically 
      decreased in patients. A 3' splice site and a stop codon mutation were identified 
      in three families, leaving most mutations uncharacterized. In this study, we 
      report a novel type of disease-causing mutation, an unstable 15- to 18-mer 
      minisatellite repeat expansion in the putative promoter region of the CST6 gene. 
      The mutation accounts for the majority of EPM1 patients worldwide. Haplotype data 
      are compatible with a single ancestral founder mutation. The length of the repeat 
      array differs between chromosomes and families, but changes in repeat number seem 
      to be comparatively rare events.

TI  - Unstable insertion in the 5' flanking region of the cystatin B gene is the most 
      common mutation in progressive myoclonus epilepsy type 1, EPM1.
PG  - 298-302
AB  - Progressive myoclonus epilepsy type 1 (EPM1, also known as Unverricht-Lundborg 
      disease) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressively 
      worsening myoclonic jerks, frequent generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and a 
      slowly progressive decline in cognition. Recently, two mutations in the cystatin 
      B gene (also known as stefin B, STFB) mapping to 21q22.3 have been implicated in 
      the EPM1 phenotype: a G-->C substitution in the last nucleotide of intron 1 that 
      was predicted to cause a splicing defect in one family, and a C-->T substitution 
      that would change an Arg codon (CGA) to a stop codon (TGA) at amino acid position 
      68, resulting in a truncated cystatin B protein in two other families. A fourth 
      family showed undetectable amounts of STFB mRNA by northern blot analysis in an 
      affected individual. We present haplotype and mutational analyses of our 
      collection of 20 unrelated EPM1 patients and families from different ethnic 
      groups. We identify four different mutations, the most common of which consists 
      of an unstable approximately 600-900 bp insertion which is resistant to PCR 
      amplification. This insertion maps to a 12-bp polymorphic tandem repeat located 
      in the 5' flanking region of the STFB gene, in the region of the promoter. The 
      size of the insertion varies between different EPM1 chromosomes sharing a common 
      haplotype and a common origin, suggesting some level of meiotic instability over 
      the course of many generations. This dynamic mutation, which appears distinct 
      from conventional trinucleotide repeat expansions, may arise via a novel 
      mechanism related to the instability of tandemly repeated sequences.

TI  - Identification of mutations in cystatin B, the gene responsible for the 
      Unverricht-Lundborg type of progressive myoclonus epilepsy (EPM1).
PG  - 342-51
AB  - Progressive myoclonus epilepsy (EPM1) is an autosomal recessive disorder, 
      characterized by severe, stimulus-sensitive myoclonus and tonic-clonic seizures. 
      The EPM1 locus was mapped to within 0.3 cM from PFKL in chromosome 21q22.3. The 
      gene for the proteinase inhibitor cystatin B was recently localized in the EPM1 
      critical region, and mutations were identified in two EPM1 families. We have 
      identified six nucleotide changes in the cystatin B gene of non-Finnish EPM1 
      families from northern Africa and Europe. The 426G-->C change in exon 1 results 
      in a Gly4Arg substitution and is the first missense mutation described that is 
      associated with EPM1. Molecular modeling predicts that this substitution severely 
      affects the contact of cystatin B with papain. Mutations in the invariant AG 
      dinucleotides of the acceptor sites of introns 1 and 2 probably result in 
      abnormal splicing. A deletion of two nucleotides in exon 3 produces a frameshift 
      and truncates the protein. Therefore, these four mutations are all predicted to 
      impair the production of functional protein. These mutations were found in 7 of 
      the 29 unrelated EPM1 patients analyzed, in homozygosity in 1, and in 
      heterozygosity in the others. The remaining two sequence changes, 431G-->T and 
      2575A-->G, probably represent polymorphic variants. In addition, a tandem repeat 
      in the 5' UTR (CCCCGCCCCGCG) is present two or three times in normal alleles. It 
      is peculiar that in the majority of patients no mutations exist within the exons 
      and splice sites of the cystatin B gene.

TI  - High-intensity proton and T2-weighted MRI signals in the globus pallidus in 
      juvenile-type of dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy.
PG  - 234-7
AB  - Dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is an autosomal dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder. An expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat sequence motif 
      in a gene on the short arm of chromosome 12 has recently been identified in 
      patients with DRPLA. Juvenile-type DRPLA is characterized by childhood onset and 
      progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME). According to the pathological study, the 
      degeneration of the globus pallidus is more marked in this than in other types. 
      We observed high-intensity signals in the globus pallidus on proton and 
      T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a patient clinically diagnosed as 
      juvenile-type DRPLA who had the expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat motif in the 
      DRPLA gene. The globus pallidus may be affected in the early stages of this type 
      of DRPLA, and MRI may be useful for the early diagnosis of DRPLA.
