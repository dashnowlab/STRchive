AB  - The extensive clinical and genetic heterogeneity of congenital limb malformation 
      calls for comprehensive genome-wide analysis of genetic variation. Genome 
      sequencing (GS) has the potential to identify all genetic variants. Here we aim 
      to determine the diagnostic potential of GS as a comprehensive one-test-for-all 
      strategy in a cohort of undiagnosed patients with congenital limb malformations. 
      We collected 69 cases (64 trios, 1 duo, 5 singletons) with congenital limb 
      malformations with no molecular diagnosis after standard clinical genetic testing 
      and performed genome sequencing. We also developed a framework to identify 
      potential noncoding pathogenic variants. We identified likely 
      pathogenic/disease-associated variants in 12 cases (17.4%) including four in 
      known disease genes, and one repeat expansion in HOXD13. In three unrelated cases 
      with ectrodactyly, we identified likely pathogenic variants in UBA2, establishing 
      it as a novel disease gene. In addition, we found two complex structural variants 
      (3%). We also identified likely causative variants in three novel high confidence 
      candidate genes. We were not able to identify any noncoding variants. GS is a 
      powerful strategy to identify all types of genomic variants associated with 
      congenital limb malformation, including repeat expansions and complex structural 
      variants missed by standard diagnostic approaches. In this cohort, no causative 
      noncoding SNVs could be identified.

TI  - TLR2/6 signaling promotes the expansion of premalignant hematopoietic stem and 
      progenitor cells in the NUP98-HOXD13 mouse model of MDS.

AB  - Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression is increased on hematopoietic stem and 
      progenitor cells (HSPCs) of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and 
      enhanced TLR2 signaling is thought to contribute to MDS pathogenesis. Notably, 
      TLR2 heterodimerizes with TLR1 or TLR6, and while high TLR2 is associated with 
      lower-risk disease, high TLR6, but not TLR1, correlates with higher-risk disease. 
      This raises the possibility of heterodimer-specific effects of TLR2 signaling in 
      MDS, and in the work described here, we tested the effects of specific modulation 
      of TLR1/2 versus TLR2/6 signaling on premalignant HSPCs. Indeed, chronic 
      stimulation of TLR2/6, but not TLR1/2, accelerates leukemic transformation in the 
      NHD13 mouse model of MDS, and conversely, loss of TLR6, but not TLR1, slows this 
      process. TLR2/6 stimulation expands premalignant HSPCs, and chimeric mouse 
      studies revealed that cell-autonomous signaling contributes to this expansion. 
      Finally, TLR2/6 stimulation is associated with an enrichment of Myc and mTORC1 
      activities. While Myc inhibition partially suppressed the TLR2/6 agonist-mediated 
      expansion of premalignant HSPCs, inhibition of mTORC1 exacerbated it, suggesting 
      that these pathways play opposite roles in regulating the effects of TLR2/6 
      ligation on HSPCs. Together, these data reveal heterodimer-specific effects of 
      TLR2 signaling on premalignant HSPCs, with TLR2/6 signaling promoting their 
      expansion and leukemic transformation.

AB  - Expansions of amino acid repeats occur in >20 inherited human disorders, and many 
      occur in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of transcription factors (TFs). 
      Such diseases are associated with protein aggregation, but the contribution of 
      aggregates to pathology has been controversial. Here, we report that alanine 
      repeat expansions in the HOXD13 TF, which cause hereditary synpolydactyly in 
      humans, alter its phase separation capacity and its capacity to co-condense with 
      transcriptional co-activators. HOXD13 repeat expansions perturb the composition 
      of HOXD13-containing condensates in vitro and in vivo and alter the 
      transcriptional program in a cell-specific manner in a mouse model of 
      synpolydactyly. Disease-associated repeat expansions in other TFs (HOXA13, RUNX2, 
      and TBP) were similarly found to alter their phase separation. These results 
      suggest that unblending of transcriptional condensates may underlie human 
      pathologies. We present a molecular classification of TF IDRs, which provides a 
      framework to dissect TF function in diseases associated with transcriptional 
      dysregulation.

TI  - A NUP98-HOXD13 fusion gene impairs differentiation of B and T lymphocytes and 
      leads to expansion of thymocytes with partial TCRB gene rearrangement.

AB  - Expression of a NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) fusion gene leads to myelodysplastic 
      syndrome in mice. In addition to ineffective hematopoiesis, we observed that 
      NHD13 mice were lymphopenic; the lymphopenia was due to a decrease in both T and 
      B lymphocytes. Although the pro-B cell (B220(+)/CD43(+)) populations from the 
      NHD13 and wild-type mice were similar, the NHD13 mice showed decreased pre-B 
      cells (B220(+)/CD43(-)), indicating impaired differentiation at the pro-B to 
      pre-B stage. Thymi from NHD13 mice were smaller and overexpressed Hoxa cluster 
      genes, including Hoxa7, Hoxa9, and Hoxa10. In addition, the NHD13 thymi contained 
      fewer thymocytes, with an increased percentage of CD4(-)/CD8(-) (double-negative 
      (DN)) cells and a decreased percentage of CD4(+)/CD8(+) (double-positive) cells; 
      the DN1/DN2 population was increased and the DN3/DN4 population was decreased, 
      suggesting a partial block at the DN2 to DN3 transition. To determine clonality 
      of the thymocytes, we used degenerate RT-PCR to identify clonal Tcrb gene 
      rearrangements. Five of six NHD13 thymi showed an unusual Tcrb gene rearrangement 
      pattern with common, clonal DJ rearrangements, but distinct V-D junctions, 
      suggesting a marked clonal expansion of thymocytes that had undergone a DJ 
      rearrangement, but not completed a VDJ rearrangement. Taken together, these 
      findings demonstrate that expression of the NHD13 transgene inhibits lymphoid as 
      well as myeloid and erythroid differentiation, results in overexpression of Hoxa 
      cluster genes, and leads to a precursor T cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.

TI  - Fork stalling and template switching as a mechanism for polyalanine tract 
      expansion affecting the DYC mutant of HOXD13, a new murine model of 
      synpolydactyly.
PG  - 23-30
LID - 10.1534/genetics.109.104695 [doi]
AB  - Polyalanine expansion diseases are proposed to result from unequal crossover of 
      sister chromatids that increases the number of repeats. In this report we suggest 
      an alternative mechanism we put forward while we investigated a new spontaneous 
      mutant that we named "Dyc" for "Digit in Y and Carpe" phenotype. Phenotypic 
      analysis revealed an abnormal limb patterning similar to that of the human 
      inherited congenital disease synpolydactyly (SPD) and to the mouse mutant model 
      Spdh. Both human SPD and mouse Spdh mutations affect the Hoxd13 gene within a 
      15-residue polyalanine-encoding repeat in the first exon of the gene, leading to 
      a dominant negative HOXD13. Genetic analysis of the Dyc mutant revealed a 
      trinucleotide expansion in the polyalanine-encoding region of the Hoxd13 gene 
      resulting in a 7-alanine expansion. However, unlike the Spdh mutation, this 
      expansion cannot result from a simple duplication of a short segment. Instead, we 
      propose the fork stalling and template switching (FosTeS) described for 
      generation of nonrecurrent genomic rearrangements as a possible mechanism for the 
      Dyc polyalanine extension, as well as for other polyalanine expansions described 
      in the literature and that could not be explained by unequal crossing over.

TI  - Molecular characterization of HOXA13 polyalanine expansion proteins in 
      hand-foot-genital syndrome.
PG  - 3161-8
AB  - We report on a father and daughter with hand-foot-genital syndrome (HFGS) with 
      typical skeletal and genitourinary anomalies due to a 14-residue polyalanine 
      expansion in HOXA13. This is the largest (32 residues) polyalanine tract so far 
      described for any polyalanine mutant protein. Polyalanine expansion results in 
      protein misfolding, cytoplasmic aggregation and degradation; however, HOXA13 
      polyalanine expansions appear to act as loss of function mutations in contrast to 
      gain of function for HOXD13 polyalanine expansions. To address this paradox we 
      examined the cellular consequences of polyalanine expansions on HOXA13 protein 
      using COS cell transfection and immunocytochemistry. HOXA13 polyalanine expansion 
      proteins form cytoplasmic aggregates, and distribution between cytoplasmic 
      aggregates or the nucleus is polyalanine tract size-dependent. Geldanamycin, an 
      Hsp90 inhibitor, reduces the steady-state abundance of all polyalanine-expanded 
      proteins in transfected cells. We also found that wild-type HOXA13 or HOXD13 
      proteins are sequestered in HOXA13 polyalanine expansion cytoplasmic aggregates. 
      Thus, the difference between HOXA13 polyalanine expansion loss-of-function and 
      HOXD13 polyalanine expansion dominant-negative effect is not the ability to 
      aggregate wild-type group 13 paralogs but perhaps to variation in activities 
      associated with refolding, aggregation or degradation of the proteins.

TI  - HOXD13 polyalanine tract expansion in classical synpolydactyly type Vordingborg.
PG  - 116-21
AB  - In 1927, Oluf Thomsen, in a classic paper, described a seven-generation family 
      with autosomal dominant axial synpolydactyly (SPD)--the Vordingborgtyp of axis 
      duplication and dysostosis. Expansion of a polyalanine tract in the HOXD13 gene 
      is known to cause synpolydactyly. We have rediscovered part of the family 
      described by Thomsen, and detected a 9 triplet polyalanine expansion within 
      HOXD13segregating with the disorder. The phenotypic spectrum in mutation carriers 
      ranged from severe to inapparent bone malformations. In the latter case, only 
      dermatoglyphics revealed the genetic status.

TI  - The mouse Hoxd13(spdh) mutation, a polyalanine expansion similar to human type II 
      synpolydactyly (SPD), disrupts the function but not the expression of other Hoxd 
      genes.
PG  - 345-53
AB  - Polyalanine expansion in the human HOXD13 gene induces synpolydactyly (SPD), an 
      inherited congenital limb malformation. A mouse model was isolated, which showed 
      a spontaneous alanine expansion due to a 21-bp duplication at the corresponding 
      place in the mouse gene. This mutation (synpolydactyly homolog, spdh), when 
      homozygous, causes malformations in mice similar to those seen in affected human 
      patients. We have studied the genetics of this condition, by using several 
      engineered Hoxd alleles, as well as by looking at the expression of Hox and other 
      marker genes. We show that the mutated SPDH protein induces a gain-of-function 
      phenotype, likely by behaving as a dominant negative over other Hox genes. The 
      mutation, however, seems to act independently from Hoxa13 and doesn't appear to 
      affect Hox gene expression, except for a slight reduction of the HOXD13 protein 
      itself. Developmental studies indicate that the morphological effect is mostly 
      due to a severe retardation in the growth and ossification of the bony elements, 
      in agreement with a general impairment in the function of posterior Hoxd genes.
