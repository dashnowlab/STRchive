TI  - Assessment of the Clinical Interactions of GAA Repeat Expansions in FGF14 and 
      FXN.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The number of GAA repeats in the FXN gene is a major 
      but not sole determinant of the clinical presentation of Friedreich ataxia 
      (FRDA). The objective of this study was to establish whether the length of the 
      GAA repeat tract in the FGF14 gene, which is associated with another 
      neurodegenerative disorder (SCA27B), affects the clinical presentation (age at 
      onset, mFARS score) of patients with FRDA. METHODS: The number of GAA repeats in 
      the FXN and FGF14 genes was determined using PCR in a cohort of 221 patients with 
      FRDA. Next, we compared absolute lengths of the FGF14 GAAs with FXN GAAs, 
      followed by correlative analyses to determine potential effects of FGF14 GAA 
      length on age at onset and clinical presentation (mFARS) of FRDA. RESULTS: We 
      found no significant correlation between the size of the GAA repeats in FXN and 
      FGF14 loci in our FRDA cohort. Moreover, the number of GAAs in FGF14 did not 
      affect the clinical presentation of FRDA even in a small number of cases where a 
      long FGF14 allele was present. DISCUSSION: Despite both molecular and clinical 
      similarities between FRDA and SCA27B, the length of the GAA repeats in the FGF14 
      gene, including potentially pathogenic alleles, did not influence the clinical 
      presentation of FRDA.

TI  - Screening for SCA27B, CANVAS and other repeat expansion disorders in Greek 
      patients with late-onset cerebellar ataxia suggests a need to update current 
      diagnostic algorithms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Late-onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA) is a slowly progressive cerebellar 
      disorder with symptom onset >/=30years of age. Intronic tandem repeat expansions 
      (TREs) in RFC1 and FGF14 have recently emerged as common causes of LOCA. The 
      relative contribution of classic vs. newly discovered TREs has not been 
      systematically investigated in LOCA cohorts. METHODS: Over 28 years, 206 
      consecutive Greek LOCA index patients were referred for genetic testing and, 
      based on clinical data and inheritance pattern, screened for FRDA, SCA1,2,3,6,7, 
      FXTAS, CANVAS and SCA27B. RESULTS: A genetic diagnosis was reached in 62 of 206 
      cases (30.1 %). Mean age was 60.1 +/- 11.2 (35-87) years and mean age at onset 
      (AAO) 52.5 +/- 11.4 (30-80) years. SCA27B accounted for 9.7 % of LOCA cases, CANVAS 
      for 7.8 % and FRDA for 4.4 %. The overall frequency of SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 was 
      6.8 %. No cases of SCA3 and SCA6 were identified. FXTAS contributed 1.5 % of 
      cases. In sporadic cases, the diagnostic yield was 22.8 % (34 of 149; SCA27B: 
      8.7 %, CANVAS: 8.1 %, FRDA: 2.7 %, SCA2: 1.3 %, FXTAS: 1.3 % and SCA7: 0.7 %). In 
      familial cases, the diagnostic yield was 49.1 % (28 of 57). Two cases with CANVAS 
      had pseudodominant inheritance. Patients with SCA27B, CANVAS and FXTAS had mean 
      AAO > 50 years, whereas patients with FRDA, SCA1, SCA2 and SCA7 had mean 
      AAO < 50 years. CONCLUSION: Recently-discovered TREs causing SCA27B and CANVAS 
      represent the commonest known genetic causes of LOCA. Prioritizing testing for 
      FGF14 and RFC1 expansions in the diagnostic algorithm of LOCA is recommended.

TI  - Differential Gene Expression in Late-Onset Friedreich Ataxia: A Comparative 
      Transcriptomic Analysis Between Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Sisters.
LID - 10.3390/ijms252111615 [doi]
LID - 11615
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is the most common inherited ataxia, primarily impacting 
      the nervous system and the heart. It is characterized by GAA repeat expansion in 
      the FXN gene, leading to reduced mitochondrial frataxin levels. Previously, we 
      described a family displaying two expanded GAA alleles, not only in the proband 
      affected by late-onset FRDA but also in the younger asymptomatic sister. The 
      molecular characterization of the expanded repeats showed that the affected 
      sister carried two canonical uninterrupted GAA expended repeats, whereas the 
      asymptomatic sister had a compound heterozygous for a canonical GAA repeat and an 
      expanded GAAGGA motif. Therefore, we decided to perform RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) 
      on fibroblasts from both sisters in order to understand whether some genes and/or 
      pathways might be differently involved in the occurrence of FRDA clinical 
      manifestation. The transcriptomic analysis revealed 398 differentially expressed 
      genes. Notably, TLR4, IL20RB, and SLITRK5 were up-regulated, while TCF21 and 
      GRIN2A were down-regulated, as validated by qRT-PCR. Gene ontology (GO) 
      enrichment and network analysis highlighted significant involvement in immune 
      response and neuronal functions. Our results, in particular, suggest that TLR4 
      may contribute to inflammation in FRDA, while IL20RB, SLITRK5, TCF21, and GRIN2A 
      dysregulation may play roles in the disease pathogenesis. This study introduces 
      new perspectives on the inflammatory and developmental aspects in FRDA, offering 
      potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Uniparental IsoDisomy: a case study on a new mechanism of Friedreich ataxia.
LID - 10.1038/s41431-024-01728-2 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA) is the most common hereditary ataxia and is mainly 
      caused by biallelic GAA repeat expansion in the FXN gene. Rare patients carrying 
      FXN point mutations or intragenic deletions are reported. We describe the first 
      FRDA patient with a chromosome 9 segmental Uniparental isoDisomy (UPiD) unmasking 
      a homozygous FXN expansion initially undetected by TP-PCR. The child presented 
      with a progressive proprioceptive ataxia associated with peripheral sensory 
      neuronopathy and severe scoliosis. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) identified a 
      maternal segmental Uniparental Isodisomy (UPiD) encompassing FXN. Short tandem 
      repeats analysis on WGS showed a biallelic FXN expansion. The identification of a 
      deletion in the primer-annealing region of the TP-PCR explained the initial 
      TP-PCR failure. This is the first documented case of FRDA caused by segmental 
      UPiD. This case highlights the complexity of the molecular diagnosis of FRDA, and 
      emphasises the importance of integrating results from various technical 
      diagnostic approaches.

TI  - Case Report of Friedreich's Ataxia and ALG1-Related Biochemical Abnormalities in 
      a Patient With Progressive Spastic Paraplegia.
PG  - e63890
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.63890 [doi]
AB  - Frataxin is an evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial protein responsible for 
      iron homeostasis and metabolism. A deficiency of frataxin (encoded by FXN) leads 
      to Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), a progressive disorder that affects both the 
      central and peripheral nervous systems, most commonly via a pathogenic GAA 
      trinucleotide expansion. In contrast, pathogenic variants in ALG1 in humans cause 
      a form of congenital disorder of glycosylation. Here, we present a 15-year-old 
      boy with a clinical presentation that raised concern for complex hereditary 
      spastic paraplegia (HSP), with motor features including progressive spastic 
      paraparesis, cervical dystonia, cerebellar dysfunction, and diminished lower 
      extremity reflexes. The proband was initially found to have a novel compound 
      heterozygous variant in ALG1 on exome sequencing, along with N-glycan profiling 
      revealing evidence of defective mannosylation and Western blot analysis 
      demonstrating an 84% reduction in ALG1 expression. Although several of his 
      clinical features could be explained by the ALG1 variant specifically or 
      considered as part of the presentation of CDGs in general, there were additional 
      phenotypes that suggested an alternative, or additional, genetic diagnosis. 
      Subsequently, he was found to have biallelic pathogenic GAA repeat expansions in 
      FXN on genome sequencing, leading to a diagnosis of FRDA. Given that FRDA 
      explained all his clinical features, the ALG1 variant may have been a hypomorphic 
      form and/or a biochemical phenotype. Our findings underscore the importance of 
      considering FRDA as a differential diagnosis in cases of complex HSP and 
      demonstrate the utility of unbiased genome sequencing approaches that include 
      detection of trinucleotide repeat expansions for progressive motor disorders.

TI  - Unusual Age-Dependent Behavior of Leukocytes Telomere Length in Friedreich's 
      Ataxia.
PG  - 2058-2066
LID - 10.1002/mds.29976 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by an expanded GAA repeat in the first intron of the FXN gene. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze leukocyte telomeres length (LTL) 
      in FRDA to verify the possible relationships between LTL and disease progression. 
      We investigated LTL in a cohort of FRDA biallelic patients (n = 61), heterozygous 
      (n = 29), and age-matched healthy subjects (n = 87). METHODS: LTL was measured by 
      real-time polymerase chain reaction quantitative analysis (qPCR). RESULTS: The 
      results showed that before 35 years of age, leukocyte telomeres were longer in 
      patients than in controls, whereas the reverse applies in patients above 36 years 
      of age. Interestingly, LTL was greater than controls at any age in heterozygous 
      subjects. This picture mirrors what has been previously observed in vitro in FRDA 
      cultured fibroblasts, showing significantly longer telomeres at early passages 
      because of activation of an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)-like 
      mechanism, but showing accelerated telomere shortening as population doubling 
      increases. GAA1 repeat length is positively correlated with the LTL and 
      negatively correlated with the age at blood sampling. The relationship of LTL 
      with clinical parameters (cardiomyopathy, diabetes, dependence on a wheelchair) 
      was also analyzed. Significantly shorter leukocyte telomeres were associated with 
      the presence of cardiomyopathy, but not with diabetes and the dependence on a 
      wheelchair. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the present study indicates that telomere 
      length analysis in FRDA may be a relevant biomarker for following the stages of 
      the disease. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Movement Disorders published by Wiley

TI  - Nerve ultrasound in CANVAS-spectrum disease: Reduced nerve size distinguishes 
      genetically confirmed CANVAS from other axonal polyneuropathies.
LID - 10.1111/jns.12655 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ultrasound nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) of patients 
      affected with axonal neuropathy usually shows normal value. Cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) seems to represent an 
      exception, showing smaller CSA, but previous reports did not test for biallelic 
      RFC1 gene repeat expansions. METHODS: We compared nerve CSA from CANVAS patients 
      (tested positive for biallelic RFC1 gene repeat expansions) with the CSA from a 
      group of patients with chronic idiopathic axonal polyneuropathy (CIAP) who tested 
      negative for RFC1 gene repeat expansions, hereditary axonal neuropathy 
      (Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2, CMT2), and Friedreich ataxia (FRDA). RESULTS: We 
      enrolled 15 CANVAS patients (eight men, mean age 66.3 +/- 11.5 years, mean disease 
      duration 9.3 +/- 4.1 years), affected with sensory axonal neuronopathy. Controls 
      consisted of 13 CIAP (mean age 68.5 +/- 12.8 years, seven men), seven CMT2 (mean 
      age 47.9 +/- 18.1 years, four men), 12 FRDA (mean age 33.7 +/- 8.8, five men). Nerve 
      ultrasound was performed at median, ulnar, sciatic, sural, and tibial nerves and 
      brachial plexus, bilaterally. The nerve CSA from CANVAS patients was 
      significantly smaller than the one from the other cohorts at several sites with 
      significant and high accuracy at Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
      analyses. RFC1 AAGGG pentanucleotide expansion, disease duration, and disability 
      did not correlate with CSA at any site, after Bonferroni correction. 
      INTERPRETATION: Decreased sonographic nerve sizes, in arms and legs, in patients 
      with sensory neuropathy and normal motor conduction studies could point to 
      CANVAS-spectrum disease and help guide appropriate genetic testing.

TI  - DNA Base Damage Repair Crosstalks with Chromatin Structures to Contract Expanded 
      GAA Repeats in Friedreich's Ataxia.
LID - 10.3390/biom14070809 [doi]
LID - 809
AB  - Trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansion is the cause of over 40 neurodegenerative 
      diseases, including Huntington's disease and Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). There 
      are no effective treatments for these diseases due to the poor understanding of 
      molecular mechanisms underlying somatic TNR expansion and contraction in neural 
      systems. We and others have found that DNA base excision repair (BER) actively 
      modulates TNR instability, shedding light on the development of effective 
      treatments for the diseases by contracting expanded repeats through DNA repair. 
      In this study, temozolomide (TMZ) was employed as a model DNA base damaging agent 
      to reveal the mechanisms of the BER pathway in modulating GAA repeat instability 
      at the frataxin (FXN) gene in FRDA neural cells and transgenic mouse mice. We 
      found that TMZ induced large GAA repeat contraction in FRDA mouse brain tissue, 
      neurons, and FRDA iPSC-differentiated neural cells, increasing frataxin protein 
      levels in FRDA mouse brain and neural cells. Surprisingly, we found that TMZ 
      could also inhibit H3K9 methyltransferases, leading to open chromatin and 
      increasing ssDNA breaks and recruitment of the key BER enzyme, pol beta, on the 
      repeats in FRDA neural cells. We further demonstrated that the H3K9 
      methyltransferase inhibitor BIX01294 also induced the contraction of the expanded 
      repeats and increased frataxin protein in FRDA neural cells by opening the 
      chromatin and increasing the endogenous ssDNA breaks and recruitment of pol beta on 
      the repeats. Our study provides new mechanistic insight illustrating that 
      inhibition of H3K9 methylation can crosstalk with BER to induce GAA repeat 
      contraction in FRDA. Our results will open a new avenue for developing novel gene 
      therapy by targeting histone methylation and the BER pathway for repeat expansion 
      diseases.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a rare neurodegenerative disease caused by an 
      expansion of a GAA repeat sequence within the Frataxin (FXN) gene. Prominent 
      regions of neurodegeneration include sensory neurons within the dorsal root 
      ganglia. Here we present a set of genetically modified FRDA induced pluripotent 
      stem cell (iPSC) lines that carry an inducible neurogenin-2 (NGN2) expression 
      cassette. Exogenous expression of NGN2 in iPSC derived neural crest progenitors 
      efficiently generates functionally mature sensory neurons. These cell lines will 
      provide a streamlined source of FRDA iPSC sensory neurons for studying both 
      disease mechanism and screening potential therapeutics.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), the most common recessive inherited ataxia, results 
      from homozygous guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) repeat expansions in intron 1 of 
      the FXN gene, which leads to the deficiency of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein 
      essential for iron-sulphur cluster synthesis. The study of frataxin protein 
      regulation might yield new approaches for FRDA treatment. Here, we report 
      tumorous imaginal disc 1 (TID1), a mitochondrial J-protein cochaperone, as a 
      binding partner of frataxin that negatively controls frataxin protein levels. 
      TID1 interacts with frataxin both in vivo in mouse cortex and in vitro in 
      cortical neurons. Acute and subacute depletion of frataxin using RNA interference 
      markedly increases TID1 protein levels in multiple cell types. In addition, TID1 
      overexpression significantly increases frataxin precursor but decreases 
      intermediate and mature frataxin levels in HEK293 cells. In primary cultured 
      human skin fibroblasts, overexpression of TID1S results in decreased levels of 
      mature frataxin and increased fragmentation of mitochondria. This effect is 
      mediated by the last 6 amino acids of TID1S as a peptide made from this sequence 
      rescues frataxin deficiency and mitochondrial defects in FRDA patient-derived 
      cells. Our findings show that TID1 negatively modulates frataxin levels, and 
      thereby suggests a novel therapeutic target for treating FRDA.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia is a spinocerebellar degenerative disease caused by 
      microsatellite (GAA.TTC)n repeat expansion in the first intron of FXN gene. Here, 
      we developed iPSC lines from an FRDA patient (IGIBi016-A) and non-FRDA healthy 
      control (IGIBi017-A). Both iPSC lines displayed typical iPSC morphology, 
      expression of pluripotency markers, regular karyotypes (46, XY; 46, XX), capacity 
      to grow into three germ layers, and FRDA hallmark -GAA repeat expansion and 
      decreased FXN mRNA. Through these iPSC lines, FRDA phenotypes may be replicated

TI  - Phenotypic variation of FXN compound heterozygotes in a Friedreich ataxia cohort.
PG  - 1110-1121
LID - 10.1002/acn3.52027 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Most individuals with Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) have homozygous GAA 
      triplet repeat expansions in the FXN gene, correlating with a typical phenotype 
      of ataxia and cardiomyopathy. A minority are compound heterozygotes carrying a 
      GAA expansion on one allele and a mutation on the other. The study aim was to 
      examine phenotypic variation among compound heterozygotes. METHODS: Data on FXN 
      mutations were obtained from the Friedreich Ataxia Clinical Outcome Measures 
      Study (FA-COMS). We compared clinical features in a single-site FA-COMS cohort of 
      51 compound heterozygous and 358 homozygous patients, including quantitative 
      measures of cardiac, neurologic, and visual disease progression. RESULTS: Non-GAA 
      repeat mutations were associated with reduced cardiac disease, and patients with 
      minimal/no function mutations otherwise had a typical FRDA phenotype but with 
      significantly more severe progression. The partial function mutation group was 
      characterized by relative sparing of bulbar and upper limb function, as well as 
      particularly low cardiac involvement. Other clinical features in this group, 
      including optic atrophy and diabetes mellitus, varied widely depending on the 
      specific type of partial function mutation. INTERPRETATION: These data support 
      that the typical FRDA phenotype is driven by frataxin deficiency, especially 
      severe in compound heterozygotes with minimal/no function mutations, whereas the 
      heterogeneous presentations of those with partial function mutations may indicate 
      other contributing factors to FRDA pathogenesis.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the hyper expansion 
      of (GAA-TTC)n triplet repeats in the first intron of the FXN gene. Here, we 
      generated iPSC lines from two individuals with FRDA, both of whom have homozygous 
      GAA repeat expansion in the first intron of FXN gene. Both iPSC lines 
      demonstrated characteristics of pluripotency, including expression of 
      pluripotency markers, stable karyotypes and ability to develop into all three 
      germ layers, and presence of GAA repeat expansion with reduced FXN mRNA 
      expression. These iPSC lines will serve as invaluable tools for investigating the 
      pathophysiology and phenotypes of FRDA.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal-recessive disorder primarily 
      attributed to biallelic GAA repeat expansions that reduce expression of the 
      mitochondrial protein frataxin (FXN). FRDA is characterized by progressive 
      neurodegeneration, with many patients developing cardiomyopathy that progresses 
      to heart failure and death. The potential to reverse or prevent progression of 
      the cardiac phenotype of FRDA was investigated in a mouse model of FRDA, using an 
      adeno-associated viral vector (AAV8) containing the coding sequence of the FXN 
      gene. The Fxn(flox/null)::MCK-Cre conditional knockout mouse (FXN-MCK) has an FXN 
      gene ablation that prevents FXN expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle, 
      leading to cardiac insufficiency, weight loss, and morbidity. FXN-MCK 
      mice received a single intravenous injection of an AAV8 vector containing human 
      (hFXN) or mouse (mFXN) FXN genes under the control of a phosphoglycerate kinase 
      promoter. Compared to vehicle-treated FXN-MCK control mice, AAV-treated FXN-MCK 
      mice displayed increases in body weight, reversal of cardiac deficits, and 
      increases in survival without apparent toxicity in the heart or liver for up to 
      12 weeks postdose. FXN protein expression in heart tissue was detected in a 
      dose-dependent manner, exhibiting wide distribution throughout the heart similar 
      to wild type, but more speckled. These results support an AAV8-based approach to 
      treat FRDA-associated cardiomyopathy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich ataxia is a progressive multisystem disorder caused by 
      deficiency of the protein frataxin; a small mitochondrial protein involved in 
      iron sulfur cluster synthesis. Two types of frataxin exist: FXN-M, found in most 
      cells, and FXN-E, found almost exclusively in red blood cells. Treatments in 
      clinical trials include frataxin restoration by gene therapy, protein 
      replacement, and epigenetic therapies, all of which necessitate sensitive assays 
      for assessing frataxin levels. METHODS: In the present study, we have used a 
      triple quadrupole mass spectrometry-based assay to examine the features of both 
      types of frataxin levels in blood in a large heterogenous cohort of 106 patients 
      with FRDA. RESULTS: Frataxin levels (FXN-E and FXN M) were predicted by GAA 
      repeat length in regression models (R(2) values = 0.51 and 0.27, respectively), 
      and conversely frataxin levels predicted clinical status as determined by 
      modified Friedreich Ataxia Rating scale scores and by disability status (R(2) 
      values = 0.13-0.16). There was no significant change in frataxin levels in 
      individual subjects over time, and apart from start codon mutations, FXN-E and 
      FXN-M levels were roughly equal. Accounting for hemoglobin levels in a smaller 
      sub-cohort improved prediction of both FXN-E and FXN-M levels from R(2) values of 
      (0.3-0.38 to 0.20-0.51). CONCLUSION: The present data show that assay of FXN-M 
      and FXN-E levels in blood provides an appropriate biofluid for assessing their 
      repletion in particular clinical contexts.

AB  - Deficiency in human mature frataxin (hFXN-M) protein is responsible for the 
      devastating neurodegenerative and cardiodegenerative disease of Friedreich's 
      ataxia (FRDA). It results primarily through epigenetic silencing of the FXN gene 
      by GAA triplet repeats on intron 1 of both alleles. GAA repeat lengths are most 
      commonly between 600 and 1200 but can reach 1700. A subset of approximately 3% of 
      FRDA patients have GAA repeats on one allele and a mutation on the other. FRDA 
      patients die most commonly in their 30s from heart disease. Therefore, increasing 
      expression of heart hFXN-M using gene therapy offers a way to prevent early 
      mortality in FRDA. We used rhesus macaque monkeys to test the pharmacology of an 
      adeno-associated virus (AAV)hu68.CB7.hFXN therapy. The advantage of using 
      non-human primates for hFXN-M gene therapy studies is that hFXN-M and monkey 
      FXN-M (mFXN-M) are 98.5% identical, which limits potential immunologic 
      side-effects. However, this presented a formidable bioanalytical challenge in 
      quantification of proteins with almost identical sequences. This could be 
      overcome by the development of a species-specific quantitative mass 
      spectrometry-based method, which has revealed for the first time, robust 
      transgene-specific human protein expression in monkey heart tissue. The dose 
      response is non-linear resulting in a ten-fold increase in monkey heart hFXN-M 
      protein expression with only a three-fold increase in dose of the vector.

AB  - In a currently 13-year-old girl of consanguineous Turkish parents, who developed 
      unsteady gait and polyneuropathy at the ages of 3 and 6 years, respectively, we 
      performed whole genome sequencing and identified a biallelic missense variant 
      c.424C>T, p.R142W in glypican 1 (GPC1) as a putative disease-associated variant. 
      Up to date, GPC1 has not been associated with a neuromuscular disorder, and we 
      hypothesized that this variant, predicted as deleterious, may be causative for 
      the disease. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we investigated the 
      interactome of GPC1 WT and the missense variant. We identified 198 proteins 
      interacting with GPC1, of which 16 were altered for the missense variant. This 
      included CANX as well as vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) and the mammalian target of 
      rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) complex members, whose dysregulation could have a 
      potential impact on disease severity in the patient. Importantly, these proteins 
      are novel interaction partners of GPC1. At 10.5 years, the patient developed 
      dilated cardiomyopathy and kyphoscoliosis, and Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) was 
      suspected. Given the unusually severe phenotype in a patient with FRDA carrying 
      only 104 biallelic GAA repeat expansions in FXN, we currently speculate that 
      disturbed GPC1 function may have exacerbated the disease phenotype. LC-MS/MS data 
      are accessible in the ProteomeXchange Consortium (PXD040023).

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia, an autosomal recessive disorder, is caused by tandem GAA 
      nucleotide repeat expansions in intron 1 of the frataxin gene. The GAA repeats 
      over 66 in number are considered as pathogenic, and commonly occurring pathogenic 
      repeats are within a range of 600-1200. Clinically, the spectrum of features is 
      confined mainly to neurological tissues; however, cardiomyopathy and diabetes 
      mellitus have been reported in 60 and 30% of the subjects, respectively. The 
      accurate detection of GAA repeat count is of utmost importance for clinical 
      genetic correlation, and no study so far has attempted an approach that is of 
      high-throughput nature and defines the exact sequence of GAA repeats. Largely, 
      the method for detection of GAA repeats so far is either through the conventional 
      polymerase chain reaction-based screening or Southern blot, which remains the 
      gold standard method. We utilized an approach of long-range targeted 
      amplification of FXN-GAA repeats using Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION 
      platform for accurate estimation of repeat length. We were able to achieve 
      successful amplification of GAA repeats ranging from  approximately 120 to 1100 at  approximately 2600x mean 
      coverage. The total throughput achievable through our protocol can allow for 
      screening of up to 96 samples per flow cell in less than 24 h. The proposed 
      method is clinically scalable and deployable for day-to-day diagnostics. In this 
      paper, we demonstrate to resolve the genotype-phenotype correlation of 
      Friedreich's ataxia patients with better accuracy.

TI  - A Novel Metric for Predicting Severity of Disease Features in Friedreich's 
      Ataxia.
PG  - 970-977
LID - 10.1002/mds.29370 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), most commonly caused by a GAA triplet 
      repeat (GAA-TR) expansion in intron 1 of the FXN gene, is characterized by 
      deficiency of frataxin protein and clinical features such as progressive ataxia, 
      dysarthria, impaired proprioception and vibration, abolished deep tendon 
      reflexes, Babinski sign, and vision loss in association with non-neurological 
      features such as skeletal anomalies, hearing loss, cardiomyopathy, and diabetes. 
      Pathogenic GAA-TRs range in size from 60 to 1500 triplets and negatively 
      correlate with age of onset. Clinical severity is predicted by a combination of 
      GAA-TR length and disease duration (DD) via multivariable regressions, which 
      cannot typically be used for the small sample sizes in most studies on this rare 
      disease. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a single metric, which we call "disease 
      burden" (DB), that encompasses both GAA-TR length and DD for predicting disease 
      features of FRDA in small sample sizes. METHODS: Linear regression and 
      multivariable regression analysis was used to determine correlation coefficients 
      between different disease features of FRDA. RESULTS: Using large datasets for 
      validation, we found that DB predicts measures of neurological dysfunction in 
      FRDA better than GAA-TR length or DD. Analogous results were found using small 
      datasets. CONCLUSIONS: FRDA DB is a novel metric of disease severity that has 
      utility in small datasets to demonstrate correlations that would not otherwise be 
      evident with either GAA-TR or DD alone. This is important for discovering new 
      biomarkers, as well as improving the prediction of severity of disease features 
      in FRDA. (c) 2023 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

TI  - Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Frataxin Proteoforms in Whole 
      Blood as Biomarkers of the Genetic Disease Friedreich's Ataxia.
PG  - 4251-4260
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.3c00091 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is caused primarily by expanded GAA repeats in intron 
      1 of both alleles of the FXN gene, which causes transcriptional silencing and 
      reduced expression of frataxin mRNA and protein. FRDA is characterized by slowly 
      progressive ataxia and cardiomyopathy. Symptoms generally appear during 
      adolescence, and patients slowly progress to wheelchair dependency usually in the 
      late teens or early twenties with death on average in the 4th decade. There are 
      two known mature proteoforms of frataxin. Mitochondrial frataxin (frataxin-M) is 
      a 130-amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 14,268 Da, and there is an 
      alternatively spliced N-terminally acetylated 135-amino acid form (frataxin-E) 
      with a molecular weight of 14,953 Da found in erythrocytes. There is reduced 
      expression of frataxin in the heart and brain, but frataxin is not secreted into 
      the systemic circulation, so it cannot be analyzed in serum or plasma. Blood is a 
      readily accessible biofluid that contains numerous different cell types that 
      express frataxin. We have found that pig blood can serve as an excellent 
      surrogate matrix to validate an assay for frataxin proteoforms because pig 
      frataxin is lost during the immunoprecipitation step used to isolate human 
      frataxin. Frataxin-M is expressed in blood cells that contain mitochondria, 
      whereas extra-mitochondrial frataxin-E is found in erythrocytes. This means that 
      the analysis of frataxin in whole blood provides information on the concentration 
      of both proteoforms without having to isolate the individual cell types. In the 
      current study, we observed that the distributions of frataxin levels for a sample 
      of 25 healthy controls and 50 FRDA patients were completely separated from each 
      other, suggesting 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity for distinguishing 
      healthy controls from FRDA cases, a very unusual finding for a biomarker assay. 
      Additionally, frataxin levels were significantly correlated with the GAA repeat 
      length and age of onset with higher correlations for extra-mitochondrial 
      frataxin-E than those for mitochondrial frataxin-M. These findings auger well for 
      using frataxin levels measured by the validated stable isotope dilution 
      ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring/mass 
      spectrometry assay to monitor therapeutic interventions and the natural history 
      of FRDA. Our study also illustrates the utility of using whole blood for protein 
      disease biomarker discovery and validation.

AB  - GAA repeat expansion in the first intron of the frataxin (FXN) gene represses the 
      transcription of FXN, and that induces Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). 
      Pyrrole-imidazole polyamides (PIPs) are the class of oligopeptide that targets 
      double-stranded DNA with sequence selectivity. Previously, bromodomain inhibitors 
      such as JQ1 conjugated with PIPs were reported to selectively increase 
      transcription. Here, we report the synthesis of a compound that increases the 
      transcription of FXN in cells derived from an FRDA patient. The compound was 
      effective in lower (one tenth) concentration than the compound that previously 
      reported. High concentration of the compound is toxic, but toxicity was reduced 
      with a host-guest complex.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an inherited recessive 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a homozygous guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) 
      repeat expansion within intron 1 of the FXN gene, which encodes the essential 
      mitochondrial protein frataxin. There is still no effective therapy for FRDA, 
      therefore the development of optimal cell and animal models of the disease is one 
      of the priorities for preclinical therapeutic testing. METHODS: We obtained the 
      latest FRDA humanized mouse model that was generated on the basis of our previous 
      YG8sR, by Jackson laboratory [YG8JR, Fxn (null):YG8s(GAA) > 800]. We 
      characterized the behavioral, cellular, molecular and epigenetics properties of 
      the YG8JR model, which has the largest GAA repeat sizes compared to all the 
      current FRDA mouse models. RESULTS: We found statistically significant behavioral 
      deficits, together with reduced levels of frataxin mRNA and protein, and 
      aconitase activity in YG8JR mice compared with control Y47JR mice. YG8JR mice 
      exhibit intergenerational GAA repeat instability by the analysis of parent and 
      offspring tissue samples. Somatic GAA repeat instability was also detected in 
      individual brain and cerebellum tissue samples. In addition, increased DNA 
      methylation of CpG U13 was identified in FXN GAA repeat region in the brain, 
      cerebellum, and heart tissues. Furthermore, we show decreased histone H3K9 
      acetylation and increased H3K9 methylation of YG8JR cerebellum tissues within the 
      FXN gene, upstream and downstream of the GAA repeat region compared to Y47JR 
      controls. DISCUSSION: These studies provide a detailed characterization of the 
      GAA repeat expansion-based YG8JR transgenic mouse models that will help 
      investigations of FRDA disease mechanisms and therapy.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by reduced 
      expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin (FXN). Most FRDA patients are 
      homozygous for large expansions of GAA repeats in intron 1 of FXN, while some are 
      compound heterozygotes with an expanded GAA tract in one allele and a missense or 
      nonsense mutation in the other. A missense mutation, changing a glycine to valine 
      at position 130 (G130V), is prevalent among the clinical variants. We and others 
      have demonstrated that levels of mature FXN protein in FRDA G130V samples are 
      reduced below those detected in samples harboring homozygous repeat expansions. 
      Little is known regarding expression and function of endogenous FXN-G130V protein 
      due to lack of reagents and models that can distinguish the mutant FXN protein 
      from the wild-type FXN produced from the GAA-expanded allele. We aimed to 
      determine the effect of the G130V (murine G127V) mutation on Fxn expression and 
      to define its multi-system impact in vivo. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce the 
      G127V missense mutation in the Fxn coding sequence and generated homozygous mice 
      (Fxn(G127V/G127V)). We also introduced the G127V mutation into a GAA repeat 
      expansion FRDA mouse model (Fxn(GAA230/KO); KIKO) to generate a compound 
      heterozygous strain (Fxn(G127V/GAA230)). We performed neurobehavioral tests on 
      cohorts of WT and Fxn mutant animals at three-month intervals for one year, and 
      collected tissue samples to analyze molecular changes during that time. The 
      endogenous Fxn G127V protein is detected at much lower levels in all tissues 
      analyzed from Fxn(G127V/G127V) mice compared to age and sex-matched WT mice 
      without differences in Fxn transcript levels. Fxn(G127V/G127V) mice are 
      significantly smaller than WT counterparts, but perform similarly in most 
      neurobehavioral tasks. RNA sequencing analysis revealed reduced expression of 
      genes in oxidative phosphorylation and protein synthesis, underscoring the

TI  - FXN gene methylation determines carrier status in Friedreich ataxia.
PG  - 797-800
LID - 10.1136/jmg-2022-108742 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is typically caused by homozygosity for an 
      expanded GAA triplet-repeat (GAA-TRE) in intron 1 of the FXN gene. Some patients 
      are compound heterozygous for the GAA-TRE and another FXN pathogenic variant. 
      Detection of the GAA-TRE in the heterozygous state, occasionally technically 
      challenging, is essential for diagnosing compound heterozygotes and asymptomatic 
      carriers. OBJECTIVE: We explored if the FRDA differentially methylated region 
      (FRDA-DMR) in intron 1, which is hypermethylated in cis with the GAA-TRE, 
      effectively detects heterozygous GAA-TRE. METHODS: FXN DNA methylation was 
      assayed by targeted bisulfite deep sequencing using the Illumina platform. 
      RESULTS: FRDA-DMR methylation effectively identified a cohort of known 
      heterozygous carriers of the GAA-TRE. In an individual with clinical features of 
      FRDA, commercial testing showed a paternally inherited pathogenic FXN initiation 
      codon variant but no GAA-TRE. Methylation in the FRDA-DMR effectively identified 
      the proband, his mother and various maternal relatives as heterozygous carriers 
      of the GAA-TRE, thus confirming the diagnosis of FRDA. CONCLUSION: FXN DNA 
      methylation reliably detects the GAA-TRE in the heterozygous state and offers a 
      robust alternative strategy to diagnose FRDA due to compound heterozygosity and 
      to identify asymptomatic heterozygous carriers of the GAA-TRE.

AB  - Cerebellar ataxias (CAs) represent a group of autosomal dominant and recessive 
      neurodegenerative disorders affecting cerebellum with or without spinal cord. 
      Overall, CAs have preponderance for tandem nucleotide repeat expansions as an 
      etiological factor (10 TREs explain nearly 30-40% of ataxia cohort globally). The 
      experience of 10 years of common genetic ataxia subtypes for  approximately 5600 patients' 
      referrals (Pan-India) received at a single center is shared herein. Frequencies 
      (in %, n) of SCA types and FRDA in the sample cohort are observed as follows: 
      SCA12 (8.6%, 490); SCA2 (8.5%, 482); SCA1 (4.8%, 272); SCA3 (2%, 113); SCA7 
      (0.5%, 28); SCA6 (0.1%, 05); SCA17 (0.1%, 05), and FRDA (2.2%, 127). A 
      significant amount of variability in TRE lengths at each locus is observed, we 
      noted presence of biallelic expansion, co-occurrence of SCA-subtypes, and the 
      presence of premutable normal alleles. The frequency of mutated GAA-FRDA allele 
      in healthy controls is 1/158 (0.63%), thus an expected FRDA prevalence of 1:100 
      000 persons. The data of this study are relevant not only for clinical decision 
      making but also for guidance in direction of genetic investigations, 
      transancestral comparison of genotypes, and lastly provide insight for policy 
      decision for the consideration of SCAs under rare disease category.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia is an incurable disease caused by frataxin (FXN) protein 
      deficiency, which is mostly induced by GAA repeat expansion in intron 1 of the 
      FXN gene. Here, we identified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), complementary to 
      two regions within the first intron of FXN pre-mRNA, which could increase FXN 
      mRNA by  approximately 2-fold in patient fibroblasts. The increase in FXN mRNA was confirmed by 
      the identification of multiple overlapping FXN-activating ASOs at each region, 
      two independent RNA quantification assays, and normalization by multiple 
      housekeeping genes. Experiments on cells with the ASO-binding sites deleted 
      indicate that the ASO-induced FXN activation was driven by indirect effects. RNA 
      sequencing analyses showed that the two ASOs induced similar transcriptome-wide 
      changes, which did not resemble the transcriptome of wild-type cells. This 
      RNA-seq analysis did not identify directly base-paired off-target genes shared 
      across ASOs. Mismatch studies identified two guanosine-rich motifs (CCGG and G4) 
      within the ASOs that were required for FXN activation. The phosphorodiamidate 
      morpholino oligomer analogs of our ASOs did not activate FXN, pointing to a 
      PS-backbone-mediated effect. Our study demonstrates the importance of multiple, 
      detailed control experiments and target validation in oligonucleotide studies 
      employing novel mechanisms such as gene activation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive disease, whereby 
      homozygous inheritance of an expanded GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 
      first intron of the FXN gene leads to transcriptional repression of the encoded 
      protein frataxin. FRDA is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, but the 
      primary cause of death is heart disease which occurs in 60% of the patients. 
      Several functions of frataxin have been proposed, but none of them fully explain 
      why its deficiency causes the FRDA phenotypes nor why the most affected cell 
      types are neurons and cardiomyocytes. METHODS: To investigate, we generated 
      iPSC-derived neurons (iNs) and cardiomyocytes (iCMs) from an FRDA patient and 
      upregulated FXN expression via lentivirus without altering genomic GAA repeats at 
      the FXN locus. RESULTS: RNA-seq and differential gene expression enrichment 
      analyses demonstrated that frataxin deficiency affected the expression of 
      glycolytic pathway genes in neurons and extracellular matrix pathway genes in 
      cardiomyocytes. Genes in these pathways were differentially expressed when 
      compared to a control and restored to control levels when FRDA cells were 
      supplemented with frataxin. CONCLUSIONS: These results offer novel insight into 
      specific roles of frataxin deficiency pathogenesis in neurons and cardiomyocytes.

AB  - Introduction: Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a recessive neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized by progressive ataxia, dyscoordination, and loss of vision. The 
      variable length of the pathogenic GAA triplet repeat expansion in the FXN gene in 
      part explains the interindividual variability in the severity of disease. The GAA 
      repeat expansion leads to epigenetic silencing of FXN; therefore, variability in 
      properties of epigenetic effector proteins could also regulate the severity of 
      FRDA. Methods: In an exploratory analysis, DNA from 88 individuals with FRDA was 
      analyzed to determine if any of five non-synonymous SNPs in HDACs/SIRTs predicted 
      FRDA disease severity. Results suggested the need for a full analysis at the 
      rs352493 locus in SIRT6 (p.Asn46Ser). In a cohort of 569 subjects with FRDA, 
      disease features were compared between subjects homozygous for the common thymine 
      SIRT6 variant (TT) and those with the less common cytosine variant on one allele 
      and thymine on the other (CT). The biochemical properties of both variants of 
      SIRT6 were analyzed and compared. Results: Linear regression in the exploratory 
      cohort suggested that an SNP (rs352493) in SIRT6 correlated with neurological 
      severity in FRDA. The follow-up analysis in a larger cohort agreed with the 
      initial result that the genotype of SIRT6 at the locus rs352493 predicted the 
      severity of disease features of FRDA. Those in the CT SIRT6 group performed 
      better on measures of neurological and visual function over time than those in 
      the more common TT SIRT6 group. The Asn to Ser amino acid change resulting from 
      the SNP in SIRT6 did not alter the expression or enzymatic activity of SIRT6 or 
      frataxin, but iPSC-derived neurons from people with FRDA in the CT SIRT6 group 
      showed whole transcriptome differences compared to those in the TT SIRT6 group. 
      Conclusion: People with FRDA in the CT SIRT6 group have less severe neurological 
      and visual dysfunction than those in the TT SIRT6 group. Biochemical analyses 
      indicate that the benefit conferred by T to C SNP in SIRT6 does not come from 
      altered expression or enzymatic activity of SIRT6 or frataxin but is associated 
      with changes in the transcriptome.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA, OMIM#229300) is the most common hereditary ataxia, 
      resulting from the reduction of frataxin protein levels due to the expansion of 
      GAA repeats in the first intron of the FXN gene. Why the triplet repeat expansion 
      causes a decrease in Frataxin protein levels is not entirely known. Generation of 
      effective FRDA disease models is crucial for answering questions regarding the 
      pathophysiology of this disease. There have been considerable efforts to generate 
      in vitro and in vivo models of FRDA. In this perspective article, we highlight 
      studies conducted using FRDA animal models, patient-derived materials, and 
      particularly induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived models. We discuss the 
      current challenges in using FRDA animal models and patient-derived cells. 
      Additionally, we provide a brief overview of how iPSC-based models of FRDA were 
      used to investigate the main pathways involved in disease progression and to 
      screen for potential therapeutic agents for FRDA. The specific focus of this 
      perspective article is to discuss the outlook and the remaining challenges in the 
      context of FRDA iPSC-based models.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by a triplet guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) repeat expansion in intron 1 of 
      the FXN gene, which leads to decreased levels of the frataxin protein. Frataxin 
      is involved in the formation of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster prosthetic groups for 
      various metabolic enzymes. To provide a better understanding of the metabolic 
      status of patients with FRDA, here we used patient-derived fibroblast cells as a 
      surrogate tissue for metabolic and lipidomic profiling by liquid 
      chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. We found elevated HMG-CoA and 
      beta-hydroxybutyrate-CoA levels, implying dysregulated fatty acid oxidation, which 
      was further demonstrated by elevated acyl-carnitine levels. Lipidomic profiling 
      identified dysregulated levels of several lipid classes in FRDA fibroblast cells 
      when compared with non-FRDA fibroblast cells. For example, levels of several 
      ceramides were significantly increased in FRDA fibroblast cells; these results 
      positively correlated with the GAA repeat length and negatively correlated with 
      the frataxin protein levels. Furthermore, stable isotope tracing experiments 
      indicated increased ceramide synthesis, especially for long-chain fatty 
      acid-ceramides, in FRDA fibroblast cells compared with ceramide synthesis in 
      healthy control fibroblast cells. In addition, PUFA-containing triglycerides and 
      phosphatidylglycerols were enriched in FRDA fibroblast cells and negatively 
      correlated with frataxin levels, suggesting lipid remodeling as a result of FXN 
      deficiency. Altogether, we demonstrate patient-derived fibroblast cells exhibited 
      dysregulated metabolic capabilities, and their lipid dysfunction predicted the 
      severity of FRDA, making them a useful surrogate to study the metabolic status in 
      FRDA.

AB  - Frataxin deficiency in Friedreich's ataxia results from transcriptional 
      downregulation of the FXN gene caused by expansion of the intronic trinucleotide 
      guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) repeats. We used multiple transcriptomic approaches 
      to determine the molecular mechanism of transcription inhibition caused by long 
      GAAs. We uncovered that transcription of FXN in patient cells is prematurely 
      terminated upstream of the expanded repeats leading to the formation of a novel, 
      truncated and stable RNA. This FXN early terminated transcript (FXN-ett) 
      undergoes alternative, non-productive splicing and does not contribute to the 
      synthesis of functional frataxin. The level the FXN-ett RNA directly correlates 
      with the length of the longer of the two expanded GAA tracts. Targeting GAAs with 
      antisense oligonucleotides or excision of the repeats eliminates the 
      transcription impediment, diminishes expression of the aberrant FXN-ett, while 
      increasing levels of FXN mRNA and frataxin. Non-productive transcription may 
      represent a common phenomenon and attractive therapeutic target in diseases 
      caused by repeat-mediated transcription aberrations.

AB  - Friedreich ataxia is a rare autosomal recessive, neuromuscular degenerative 
      disease caused by an expansion of a trinucleotide [guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA)] 
      repeat in intron 1 of the FXN gene. It is common in the White population, 
      characterized by progressive gait and limb ataxia, lack of tendon reflexes in the 
      legs, loss of position sense, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Detection and 
      genotyping of the trinucleotide repeat length is important for the diagnosis and 
      prognosis of the disease. A two-tier genotyping assay with an improved 
      triple-repeat primed PCR (TR-PCR) for alleles <200 GAA repeats (+/-1 to 5 repeats) 
      and an agarose gel-based, long-range PCR (LR-PCR) assay to genotype expanded 
      alleles >200 GAA repeats (+/-50 repeats) is described. Of the 1236 DNA samples 
      tested using TR-PCR, 31 were identified to have expanded alleles >200 repeats and 
      were reflexed to the LR-PCR procedure for confirmation and quantification. The 
      TR-PCR assay described herein is a diagnostic genotyping assay that reduces the 
      need for further testing. The LR-PCR component is a confirmatory test for true 
      homozygous and heterozygous samples with normal and expanded alleles, as 
      indicated by the TR-PCR assay. The use of this two-tier method offers a 
      comprehensive evaluation to detect and genotype the smallest and largest number 
      of GAA repeats, improving the classification of FXN alleles as normal, mutable 
      normal, borderline, and expanded alleles.

AB  - AIMS: Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive neuromuscular disorder 
      typically caused by GAA triplet repeat expansions in both frataxin gene alleles. 
      FRDA can be complicated by diabetes mellitus (DM). The objective of this study 
      was to describe the prevalence of, risk factors for, and management practices of 
      FRDA-related DM. METHODS: FACOMS, a prospective, multi-site natural history 
      study, includes 1,104 individuals. Extracted data included the presence of DM and 
      other co-morbidities, genetic diagnosis, and markers of disease severity. We 
      performed detailed medical record review and a survey for the subset of 
      individuals with FRDA-related DM followed at one FACOMS site, Children's Hospital 
      of Philadelphia. RESULTS: FRDA-related DM was reported by 8.7% of individuals. 
      Age, severe disease, and FRDA cardiac complications were positively associated 
      with DM risk. FRDA-related DM was generally well-controlled, as reflected by 
      HbA1c, though diabetic ketoacidosis did occur. Insulin is the mainstay of 
      treatment (64-74% overall); in adults, metformin use was common and newer 
      glucose-lowering agents were used rarely. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical factors identify 
      individuals at increased risk for FRDA-related DM. Future studies should test 
      strategies for FRDA-related DM screening and management, in particular the 
      potential role for novel glucose-lowering therapies in preventing or delaying 
      FRDA-related cardiac disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansion disorders affect about 1 in 3000 individuals and are 
      clinically heterogeneous diseases caused by expansions of short tandem DNA 
      repeats. Genetic testing is often locus-specific, resulting in underdiagnosis of 
      people who have atypical clinical presentations, especially in paediatric 
      patients without a previous positive family history. Whole genome sequencing is 
      increasingly used as a first-line test for other rare genetic disorders, and we 
      aimed to assess its performance in the diagnosis of patients with neurological 
      repeat expansion disorders. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the diagnostic 
      accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect the most common repeat expansion 
      loci associated with neurological outcomes (AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, 
      C9orf72, CACNA1A, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, and TBP) using samples obtained within 
      the National Health Service in England from patients who were suspected of having 
      neurological disorders; previous PCR test results were used as the reference 
      standard. The clinical accuracy of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat 
      expansions was prospectively examined in previously genetically tested and 
      undiagnosed patients recruited in 2013-17 to the 100 000 Genomes Project in the 
      UK, who were suspected of having a genetic neurological disorder (familial or 
      early-onset forms of ataxia, neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, dementia, motor 
      neuron disease, parkinsonian movement disorders, intellectual disability, or 
      neuromuscular disorders). If a repeat expansion call was made using whole genome 
      sequencing, PCR was used to confirm the result. FINDINGS: The diagnostic accuracy 
      of whole genome sequencing to detect repeat expansions was evaluated against 793 
      PCR tests previously performed within the NHS from 404 patients. Whole genome 
      sequencing correctly classified 215 of 221 expanded alleles and 1316 of 1321 
      non-expanded alleles, showing 97.3% sensitivity (95% CI 94.2-99.0) and 99.6% 
      specificity (99.1-99.9) across the 13 disease-associated loci when compared with 
      PCR test results. In samples from 11 631 patients in the 100 000 Genomes Project, 
      whole genome sequencing identified 81 repeat expansions, which were also tested 
      by PCR: 68 were confirmed as repeat expansions in the full pathogenic range, 11 
      were non-pathogenic intermediate expansions or premutations, and two were 
      non-expanded repeats (16% false discovery rate). INTERPRETATION: In our study, 
      whole genome sequencing for the detection of repeat expansions showed high 
      sensitivity and specificity, and it led to identification of neurological repeat 
      expansion disorders in previously undiagnosed patients. These findings support 
      implementation of whole genome sequencing in clinical laboratories for diagnosis 
      of patients who have a neurological presentation consistent with a repeat 
      expansion disorder. FUNDING: Medical Research Council, Department of Health and

TI  - Characterizing cardiac phenotype in Friedreich's ataxia: The CARFA study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich's ataxia is an autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease 
      caused by a triplet repeat expansion in the frataxin gene (FXN), exhibiting 
      cerebellar sensory ataxia, diabetes and cardiomyopathy. Cardiac complications are 
      the major cause of early death. AIMS: To characterize the cardiac phenotype 
      associated with Friedreich's ataxia, and to assess the evolution of the 
      associated cardiopathy over 1 year. METHODS: This observational single-centre 
      open label study consisted of two groups: 20 subjects with Friedreich's ataxia 
      and 20 healthy controls studied over two visits over 1 year. All subjects had 
      transthoracic echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, 
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing, quantification of serum cardiac biomarkers and 
      neurological assessment. RESULTS: Patients with Friedreich's ataxia had left 
      ventricular hypertrophy, with significantly smaller left ventricular diastolic 
      diameters and volumes and increased wall thicknesses. Cardiac magnetic resonance 
      imaging demonstrated significant concentric left ventricular remodelling, 
      according to the mass/volume ratio, and focal myocardial fibrosis in 50% of 
      patients with Friedreich's ataxia. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing showed 
      alteration of left ventricular diastolic filling in patients with Friedreich's 
      ataxia, with an elevated VE/VCO(2) slope (ventilatory flow/exhaled volume of 
      carbon dioxide). High-sensitivity troponin T plasma concentrations were higher in 
      subjects with Friedreich's ataxia. None of the previous variables changed at 1 
      year. Neurological assessments remained stable for both groups, except for the 
      nine-hole pegboard test, which was altered over 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      multivariable characterization of the cardiac phenotype of patients with 
      Friedreich's ataxia was significantly different from controls at baseline. Over 1 
      year there were no clinically significant changes in patients with Friedreich's 
      ataxia compared with healthy controls, whereas the neurological severity score 
      increased modestly.

TI  - Rad9-mediated checkpoint activation is responsible for elevated expansions of GAA 
      repeats in CST-deficient yeast.
LID - 10.1093/genetics/iyab125 [doi]
LID - iyab125
AB  - Large-scale expansion of (GAA)n repeats in the first intron of the FXN gene is 
      responsible for the severe neurodegenerative disease, Friedreich's ataxia in 
      humans. We have previously conducted an unbiased genetic screen for GAA repeat 
      instability in a yeast experimental system. The majority of genes that came from 
      this screen encoded the components of DNA replication machinery, strongly 
      implying that replication irregularities are at the heart of GAA repeat 
      expansions. This screen, however, also produced two unexpected hits: members of 
      the CST complex, CDC13 and TEN1 genes, which are required for telomere 
      maintenance. To understand how the CST complex could affect intra-chromosomal GAA 
      repeats, we studied the well-characterized temperature-sensitive cdc13-1 mutation 
      and its effects on GAA repeat instability in yeast. We found that in-line with 
      the screen results, this mutation leads to  approximately 10-fold increase in the rate of 
      large-scale expansions of the (GAA)100 repeat at semi-permissive temperature. 
      Unexpectedly, the hyper-expansion phenotype of the cdc13-1 mutant largely depends 
      on activation of the G2/M checkpoint, as deletions of individual genes RAD9, 
      MEC1, RAD53, and EXO1 belonging to this pathway rescued the increased GAA 
      expansions. Furthermore, the hyper-expansion phenotype of the cdc13-1 mutant 
      depended on the subunit of DNA polymerase delta, Pol32. We hypothesize, therefore, 
      that increased repeat expansions in the cdc13-1 mutant happen during 
      post-replicative repair of nicks or small gaps within repetitive tracts during 
      the G2 phase of the cell cycle upon activation of the G2/M checkpoint.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Body mass index (BMI) and height are important indices 
      of health. We tested the association between these outcomes and clinical 
      characteristics in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), a progressive neuromuscular 
      disorder. METHODS: Participants (N = 961) were enrolled in a prospective natural 
      history study (Friedreich Ataxia Clinical Outcome Measure Study). Age- and 
      sex-specific BMI and height Z-scores were calculated using CDC 2000 references 
      for participants younger than 18 years. For adults aged 18 years or older, height 
      Z-scores were also calculated, and absolute BMI was reported. Univariate and 
      multivariate linear regression analyses tested the associations between 
      exposures, covariates, and BMI or height measured at the baseline visit. In 
      children, the superimposition by translation and rotation analysis method was 
      used to compare linear growth trajectories between FRDA and a healthy reference 
      cohort, the Bone Mineral Density in Childhood Study (n = 1,535 used for 
      analysis). RESULTS: Median age at the baseline was 20 years (IQR, 13-33 years); 
      49% (n = 475) were women. A substantial proportion of children (17%) were 
      underweight (BMI-Z < fifth percentile), and female sex was associated with lower 
      BMI-Z (beta = -0.34, p < 0.05). In adults, older age was associated with higher BMI 
      (beta = 0.09, p < 0.05). Regarding height, in children, older age (beta -0.06, p < 
      0.05) and worse modified Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS) scores (beta = -1.05 
      for fourth quartile vs first quartile, p < 0.01) were associated with shorter 
      stature. In girls, the magnitude of the pubertal growth spurt was less, and in 
      boys, the pubertal growth spurt occurred later (p < 0.001 for both) than in a 
      healthy reference cohort. In adults, in unadjusted analyses, both earlier age of 
      FRDA symptom onset (=0.09, p < 0.05) and longer guanine-adenine-adenine repeat 
      length (shorter of the 2 GAA repeats, beta = -0.12, p < 0.01) were associated with 
      shorter stature. Both adults and children with higher mFARS scores and/or who 
      were nonambulatory were less likely to have height and weight measurements 
      recorded at clinical visits. DISCUSSION: FRDA affects both weight gain and linear 
      growth. These insights will inform assessments of affected individuals in both 
      research and clinical settings.

TI  - Clinical and Molecular Features of First Mexican Friedreich's Ataxia Patients

AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is caused by homozygous GAA repeat 
      expansions or compound heterozygous (CH) mutations in FXN gene. Its broad 
      clinical spectrum makes it difficult to identify, thus an accurate diagnosis can 
      only be made by genetic testing. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to present data on 
      FXN variants observed in patients with sporadic or recessive ataxia, including 
      detailed data of the first CH Mexican patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One 
      hundred and eight patients with recessive or sporadic cerebellar ataxia were 
      referred to our institution between 2009 and 2019 for FXN molecular testing. This 
      was achieved using a combined methodology of triplet repeat-primed PCR 
      (polymerase chain reaction), long PCR, FXN sequencing and multiplex-ligation 
      probe-amplification. RESULTS: Eighteen patients had a homozygous FXN genotype; 
      whereas five were CH patients with a slow progression and phenotypic variability, 
      including a late-onset case with spastic paraparesis, and a 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth-like case. CONCLUSIONS: These first Mexican CH patients pose 
      important implications for genetic counseling and FRDA management.

TI  - Longitudinal investigation of brain activation during motor tasks in Friedreich 
      ataxia: 24-month data from IMAGE-FRDA.
PG  - 809-819
LID - 10.1007/s00429-021-02413-6 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive autosomal recessive disease. While 
      motor dysfunction is the primary neurological hallmark, little is known about the 
      underlying neurobiological changes associated with motor deficits over the course 
      of disease. We investigated the hypothesis that progressive functional changes in 
      both the cerebellum and cerebrum are related to longitudinal changes in 
      performance on complex motor tasks in individuals with FRDA. Twenty-two 
      individuals with FRDA and 28 controls participated over 24 months. The 
      longitudinal investigation included finger tapping tasks with different levels of 
      complexity (i.e., visually cued, multi-finger; self-paced, single finger), 
      performed in conjunction with fMRI acquisitions, to interrogate changes in the 
      neurobiology of motor and attentional brain networks including the cerebellum and 
      cerebrum. We demonstrated evidence for significant longitudinal decreased 
      cerebral fMRI activity over time in individuals with FRDA, relative to controls, 
      during an attentionally-demanding motor task (visually cued tapping of multiple 
      fingers) in six cerebral regions: right and left superior frontal gyri, right 
      superior temporal gyrus, right primary somatosensory area, right anterior 
      cingulate cortex, and right medial frontal gyrus. Importantly, longitudinal 
      decreased activity was associated with more severe disease status at baseline, 
      higher GAA1 repeat length and earlier age of onset. These findings suggest a 
      dynamic pattern of neuronal activity in motor, attention and executive control 
      networks over time in individuals with FRDA, which is associated with increased 
      disease severity at baseline, increased GAA1 repeat length and earlier age at 
      onset.

TI  - Neuroinflammation in the Cerebellum and Brainstem in Friedreich Ataxia: An 
      [18F]-FEMPA PET Study.
PG  - 218-224
LID - 10.1002/mds.28825 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation is proposed to accompany, or even contribute to, 
      neuropathology in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), with implications for disease 
      treatment and tracking. OBJECTIVES: To examine brain glial activation and 
      systemic immune dysfunction in people with FRDA and quantify their relationship 
      with symptom severity, duration, and onset age. METHODS: Fifteen individuals with 
      FRDA and 13 healthy controls underwent brain positron emission tomography using 
      the translocator protein (TSPO) radioligand [(18) F]-FEMPA, a marker of glial 
      activation, together with the quantification of blood plasma inflammatory 
      cytokines. RESULTS: [(18) F]-FEMPA binding was significantly increased in the 
      dentate nuclei (d = 0.67), superior cerebellar peduncles (d = 0.74), and midbrain 
      (d = 0.87), alongside increased plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) (d = 0.73), in 
      individuals with FRDA compared to controls. Increased [(18) F]-FEMPA binding in 
      the dentate nuclei, brainstem, and cerebellar anterior lobe correlated with 
      earlier age of symptom onset (controlling for the genetic triplet repeat 
      expansion length; all r (part)  < -0.6), and in the pons and anterior lobe with 
      shorter disease duration (r = -0.66; -0.73). CONCLUSIONS: Neuroinflammation is 
      evident in brain regions implicated in FRDA neuropathology. Increased neuroimmune 
      activity may be related to earlier disease onset and attenuate over the course of 
      the illness. (c) 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetics of cerebellar ataxia is complex. Hundreds of causative 
      genes have been identified, but only a few cause more than single cases. The 
      spectrum of ataxia-causing genes differs considerably between populations. The 
      aim of the study was to investigate the molecular epidemiology of ataxia in the 
      Finnish population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients in hospital database were 
      reviewed for the diagnosis of unspecified ataxia. Acquired ataxias and nongenetic 
      ataxias such as those related to infection, trauma or stroke were excluded. Sixty 
      patients with sporadic ataxia with unknown etiology and 36 patients with familial 
      ataxia of unknown etiology were recruited in the study. Repeat expansions in the 
      SCA genes (ATXN1, 2, 3, 7, 8/OS, CACNA1A, TBP), FXN, and RFC1 were determined. 
      Point mutations in POLG, SPG7 and in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were investigated. 
      In addition, DNA from 8 patients was exome sequenced. RESULTS: A genetic cause of 
      ataxia was found in 33 patients (34.4%). Seven patients had a dominantly 
      inherited repeat expansion in ATXN8/OS. Ten patients had mitochondrial ataxia 
      resulting from mutations in nuclear mitochondrial genes POLG or RARS2, or from a 
      point mutation m.8561C > G or a single deletion in mtDNA. Interestingly, five 
      patients were biallelic for the recently identified pathogenic repeat expansion 
      in RFC1. All the five patients presented with the phenotype of cerebellar ataxia, 
      neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia (CANVAS). Moreover, screening of 54 patients 
      with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy revealed four additional patients with 
      biallelic repeat expansion in RFC1, but none of them had cerebellar symptoms. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Expansion in ATXN8/OS results in the majority of dominant ataxias in 
      Finland, while mutations in RFC1 and POLG are the most common cause of recessive 
      ataxias. Our results suggest that analysis of RFC1 should be included in the 
      routine diagnostics of idiopathic ataxia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth polyneuropathy.

TI  - Treatment with ROS detoxifying gold quantum clusters alleviates the functional 
      decline in a mouse model of Friedreich ataxia.
LID - eabe1633 [pii]
LID - 10.1126/scitranslmed.abe1633 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is caused by the reduced expression of the mitochondrial 
      protein frataxin (FXN) due to an intronic GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in 
      the FXN gene. Although FRDA has no cure and few treatment options, there is 
      research dedicated to finding an agent that can curb disease progression and 
      address symptoms as neurobehavioral deficits, muscle endurance, and heart 
      contractile dysfunctions. Because oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions 
      are implicated in FRDA, we demonstrated the systemic delivery of catalysts 
      activity of gold cluster superstructures (Au(8)-pXs) to improve cell response to 
      mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and thereby alleviate FRDA-related 
      pathology in mesenchymal stem cells from patients with FRDA. We also found that 
      systemic injection of Au(8)-pXs ameliorated motor function and cardiac 
      contractility of YG8sR mouse model that recapitulates the FRDA phenotype. These 
      effects were associated to long-term improvement of mitochondrial functions and 
      antioxidant cell responses. We related these events to an increased expression of 
      frataxin, which was sustained by reduced autophagy. Overall, these results 
      encourage further optimization of Au(8)-pXs in experimental clinical strategies 
      for the treatment of FRDA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening for short tandem repeat (STR) expansions in next-generation 
      sequencing data can enable diagnosis, optimal clinical management/treatment, and 
      accurate genetic counseling of patients with repeat expansion disorders. We aimed 
      to develop an efficient computational workflow for reliable detection of STR 
      expansions in next-generation sequencing data and demonstrate its clinical 
      utility. METHODS: We characterized the performance of eight STR analysis methods 
      (lobSTR, HipSTR, RepeatSeq, ExpansionHunter, TREDPARSE, GangSTR, STRetch, and 
      exSTRa) on next-generation sequencing datasets of samples with known 
      disease-causing full-mutation STR expansions and genomes simulated to harbor 
      repeat expansions at selected loci and optimized their sensitivity. We then used 
      a machine learning decision tree classifier to identify an optimal combination of 
      methods for full-mutation detection. In Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA)-aligned 
      genomes, the ensemble approach of using ExpansionHunter, STRetch, and exSTRa 
      performed the best (precision = 82%, recall = 100%, F1-score = 90%). We applied 
      this pipeline to screen 301 families of children with suspected genetic 
      disorders. RESULTS: We identified 10 individuals with full-mutations in the AR, 
      ATXN1, ATXN8, DMPK, FXN, or HTT disease STR locus in the analyzed families. 
      Additional candidates identified in our analysis include two probands with 
      borderline ATXN2 expansions between the established repeat size range for 
      reduced-penetrance and full-penetrance full-mutation and seven individuals with 
      FMR1 CGG repeats in the intermediate/premutation repeat size range. In 67 
      probands with a prior negative clinical PCR test for the FMR1, FXN, or DMPK 
      disease STR locus, or the spinocerebellar ataxia disease STR panel, our pipeline 
      did not falsely identify aberrant expansion. We performed clinical PCR tests on 
      seven (out of 10) full-mutation samples identified by our pipeline and confirmed 
      the expansion status in all, showing absolute concordance between our 
      bioinformatics and molecular findings. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully 
      demonstrated the application of a well-optimized bioinformatics pipeline that 
      promotes the utility of genome-wide sequencing as a first-tier screening test to 
      detect expansions of known disease STRs. Interrogating clinical next-generation 
      sequencing data for pathogenic STR expansions using our ensemble pipeline can 
      improve diagnostic yield and enhance clinical outcomes for patients with repeat 
      expansion disorders.

TI  - Interruptions of the FXN GAA Repeat Tract Delay the Age at Onset of Friedreich's 
      Ataxia in a Location Dependent Manner.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22147507 [doi]
LID - 7507
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a comparatively rare autosomal recessive 
      neurological disorder primarily caused by the homozygous expansion of a GAA 
      trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the FXN gene. The repeat expansion causes 
      gene silencing that results in deficiency of the frataxin protein leading to 
      mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and cell death. The GAA repeat tract 
      in some cases may be impure with sequence variations called interruptions. It has 
      previously been observed that large interruptions of the GAA repeat tract, 
      determined by abnormal MboII digestion, are very rare. Here we have used triplet 
      repeat primed PCR (TP PCR) assays to identify small interruptions at the 5' and 
      3' ends of the GAA repeat tract through alterations in the electropherogram trace 
      signal. We found that contrary to large interruptions, small interruptions are 
      more common, with 3' interruptions being most frequent. Based on detection of 
      interruptions by TP PCR assay, the patient cohort (n = 101) was stratified into 
      four groups: 5' interruption, 3' interruption, both 5' and 3' interruptions or 
      lacking interruption. Those patients with 3' interruptions were associated with 
      shorter GAA1 repeat tracts and later ages at disease onset. The age at disease 
      onset was modelled by a group-specific exponential decay model. Based on this 
      modelling, a 3' interruption is predicted to delay disease onset by approximately 
      9 years relative to those lacking 5' and 3' interruptions. This highlights the 
      key role of interruptions at the 3' end of the GAA repeat tract in modulating the 
      disease phenotype and its impact on prognosis for the patient.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder which is caused 
      by triplet repeat expansion (GAA) in the first intron of FXN gene. In this 
      present study, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) lines from 
      fibroblasts of three unrelated FRDA patients using integration-free episomal 
      vectors. All iPSC lines express the pluripotency markers such as OCT4 and SSEA4, 
      display normal karyotypes and can differentiate into all three germ layers via in 
      vivo teratoma formation assay.

TI  - Remember Friedreich ataxia even in a toddler with apparently isolated dilated 
      (not hypertrophic!) cardiomyopathy. Revisited.
PG  - 117-123
LID - 10.23736/S2724-5276.21.05969-3 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is the most common form of ataxia in late childhood. 
      Neurological manifestations often precede cardiac involvement, presenting mainly 
      as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We describe a toddler with apparently isolated 
      severe heart failure, successfully managed with heart transplant (HT). Although 
      well described in adolescents and adults, onset of FRDA is very uncommon in 
      toddlers and neurological ataxic features are predominant. The presenting symptom 
      of cardiomyopathy is very rare. Similar history is rarely reported in literature, 
      that we described, including an aggressive cardiomyopathy in children younger 
      than 5 years-old. RESULTS: Our patient was diagnosed with FRDA at a postoperative 
      stage due to minimal neurological manifestations. Moreover, the novelty of this 
      study lies in demonstrating a major DNA triplet repeat expansion in skeletal 
      muscle compared to DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes. These results support 
      the concept that triplet repeat expansion is variable among different tissues in 
      FRDA, and in our case it was more expanded in the post mitotic muscular tissue 
      than in blood cells. We believe on the importance of taking in consideration this 
      rare condition even in a toddler with apparently isolated cardiomyopathy and 
      especially when conventional investigations give negative results. We discuss 
      potential trigger effect of HT as a precipitating factor in manifesting 
      neurological symptoms. This observation corresponds to our experience and relates 
      to three patients described so far (the third patient died suddenly). Early onset 
      cardiomyopathy with FRDA should increase awareness of this rare condition and we 
      highlight HT successful outcome. Further reports are needed to delineate this 
      rare condition in youngsters.

TI  - The displacement of frataxin from the mitochondrial cristae correlates with 
      abnormal respiratory supercomplexes formation and bioenergetic defects in cells 
      of Friedreich ataxia patients.
PG  - e21362
LID - 10.1096/fj.202000524RR [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from a severe 
      decrease of frataxin (FXN). Most patients carry a GAA repeat expansion in both 
      alleles of the FXN gene, whereas a small fraction of them are compound 
      heterozygous for the expansion and a point mutation in the other allele. FXN is 
      involved in the mitochondrial biogenesis of the FeS-clusters. Distinctive feature 
      of FRDA patient cells is an impaired cellular respiration, likely due to a 
      deficit of key redox cofactors working as electrons shuttles through the 
      respiratory chain. However, a definite relationship between FXN levels, 
      FeS-clusters assembly dysregulation and bioenergetics failure has not been 
      established. In this work, we performed a comparative analysis of the 
      mitochondrial phenotype of cell lines from FRDA patients, either homozygous for 
      the expansion or compound heterozygotes for the G130V mutation. We found that, in 
      healthy cells, FXN and two key proteins of the FeS-cluster assembly machinery are 
      enriched in mitochondrial cristae, the dynamic subcompartment housing the 
      respiratory chain. On the contrary, FXN widely redistributes to the matrix in 
      FRDA cells with defects in respiratory supercomplexes assembly and altered 
      respiratory function. We propose that this could be relevant for the early 
      mitochondrial defects afflicting FRDA cells and that perturbation of 
      mitochondrial morphodynamics could in turn be critical in terms of disease 
      mechanisms.

TI  - The Complex Genetic Landscape of Hereditary Ataxias in Turkey and Implications in 
      Clinical Practice.
PG  - 1676-1688
LID - 10.1002/mds.28518 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genetic and epidemiological features of hereditary ataxias have 
      been reported in several populations; however, Turkey is still unexplored. Due to 
      high consanguinity, recessive ataxias are more common in Turkey than in Western 
      European populations. OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevalence and genetic structure 
      of hereditary ataxias in the Turkish population. METHODS: Our cohort consisted of 
      1296 index cases and 324 affected family members. Polymerase chain reaction 
      followed by Sanger sequencing or fragment analysis were performed to screen for 
      the trinucleotide repeat expansions in families with a dominant inheritance 
      pattern, as well as in sporadic cases. The expansion in the frataxin (FXN) gene 
      was tested in all autosomal recessive cases and in sporadic cases with a 
      compatible phenotype. Whole-exome sequencing was applied to 251 probands, 
      selected based on the family history, age of onset, and phenotype. RESULTS: 
      Mutations in known ataxia genes were identified in 30% of 1296 probands. 
      Friedreich's ataxia was found to be the most common recessive ataxia in Turkey, 
      followed by autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay. 
      Spinocerebellar ataxia types 2 and 1 were the most common dominant ataxias. 
      Whole-exome sequencing was performed in 251 probands with an approximate 
      diagnostic yield of 50%. Forty-eight novel variants were found in a plethora of 
      genes, suggesting a high heterogeneity. Variants of unknown significance were 
      discussed in light of clinical data. CONCLUSION: With the large sample size 
      recruited across the country, we consider that our results provide an accurate 
      picture of the frequency of hereditary ataxias in Turkey. (c) 2021 International

AB  - Auditory neural impairment is a key clinical feature of Friedreich's Ataxia 
      (FRDA). We aimed to characterize the phenotypical spectrum of the auditory 
      impairment in FRDA in order to facilitate early identification and timely 
      management of auditory impairment in FRDA patients and to explore the 
      relationship between the severity of auditory impairment with genetic variables 
      (the expansion size of GAA trinucleotide repeats, GAA1 and GAA2), when controlled 
      for variables such as disease duration, severity of the disease and cognitive 
      status. Twenty-seven patients with genetically confirmed FRDA underwent baseline 
      audiological assessment (pure-tone audiometry, otoacoustic emissions, auditory 
      brainstem response). Twenty of these patients had additional psychophysical 
      auditory processing evaluation including an auditory temporal processing test 
      (gaps in noise test) and a binaural speech perception test that assesses spatial 
      processing (Listening in Spatialized Noise-Sentences Test). Auditory spatial and 
      auditory temporal processing ability were significantly associated with the 
      repeat length of GAA1. Patients with GAA1 greater than 500 repeats had more 
      severe auditory temporal and spatial processing deficits, leading to poorer 
      speech perception. Furthermore, the spatial processing ability was strongly 
      correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. To our knowledge, 
      this is the first study to demonstrate an association between genotype and 
      auditory spatial processing phenotype in patients with FRDA. Auditory temporal 
      processing, neural sound conduction, spatial processing and speech perception 
      were more severely affected in patients with GAA1 greater than 500 repeats. The 
      results of our study may indicate that auditory deprivation plays a role in the 
      development of mild cognitive impairment in FRDA patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive mitochondrial 
      disease most commonly due to a triplet repeat expansion guanine-adenine-adenine 
      (GAA) in the FXN gene. Cardiac disease is the major cause of death, patients with 
      reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) having the worse prognosis. 
      Longitudinal strain (LS) appeared to be a better predictor of outcome than LVEF 
      in different diseases. We compared the prognostic value of LS measured from the 4 
      chambers view to LVEF. METHODS: From 2003 to 2017 consecutive patients with FA 
      were included and LS analysis was retrospectively performed. RESULTS: We studied 
      140 patients, with a median age of 34 (26-41) years (Q1-Q3) with age at onset of 
      14 (11-19) years and GAA repeats on the shorter allele of 600 (467-783) pb. Mean 
      LS was 19.9 +/- 5.0% and LVEF 64 +/- 8%. After a mean follow-up of 7.4 +/- 3.9 years, 
      14 patients died. In univariate Cox analysis, all-cause mortality was associated 
      with: LS (HR 0.83; 95%CI, 0.75-0.91, p = 0.0002), LVEF (HR 0.30; 95%CI, 
      0.19-0.49, p < 0.0001), GAA repeats on the shorter allele (HR 1.29; 95%CI, 
      1.10-1.51, p = 0.002), age at onset (HR 0.87; 95%CI, 0.77-0.98, p = 0.018), 
      LVSystolic Diameter (HR 1.17; 95%CI, 1.09-1.26, p < 0.0001), LVMass index (HR 
      1.02; 95%CI, 1.00-1.04, p = 0.027), and LVDiastolic Diameter (HR1.12; 95%CI, 
      1.01-1.23, p = 0.028). In multivariate analysis, LVEF was the only independent 
      predictor of mortality (HR 0.41; 95%CI, 0.23-0.74, p = 0.0029). CONCLUSION: In 
      FA, LS was not an independent predictor of mortality, LVEF remained the only 
      independent predictor in the present study.

AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a frequent autosomal recessive disease caused by a 
      GAA repeat expansion in the FXN gene encoding frataxin, a mitochondrial protein 
      involved in iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis. Resulting frataxin deficiency 
      affects ISC-containing proteins and causes iron to accumulate in the brain and 
      heart of FRDA patients. Here we report on abnormal cellular iron homeostasis in 
      FRDA fibroblasts inducing a massive iron overload in cytosol and mitochondria. We 
      observe membrane transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) accumulation, increased TfR1 
      endocytosis, and delayed Tf recycling, ascribing this to impaired TfR1 
      palmitoylation. Frataxin deficiency is shown to reduce coenzyme A (CoA) 
      availability for TfR1 palmitoylation. Finally, we demonstrate that artesunate, 
      CoA, and dichloroacetate improve TfR1 palmitoylation and decrease iron overload, 
      paving the road for evidence-based therapeutic strategies at the actionable level 
      of TfR1 palmitoylation in FRDA.

TI  - Efficacy and Tolerability of Interferon Gamma in Treatment of Friedreich's 
      Ataxia: Retrospective Study.
PG  - 270-273
LID - 10.29399/npa.25047 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA) is the most common form of autosomal recessive ataxia. 
      The disease primarily results from a GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion within 
      the FXN gene in up to 97% of patients. The clinical presentation begins 
      approximately between the ages of 5 and 15. The major clinical findings of FRDA 
      are progressive extremity and gait ataxia. Although it is known that the disease 
      is caused by low levels of functional protein in the target tissues, there is no 
      effective treatment available for this pathology. However, significant 
      improvements have been achieved in the research into pharmacological treatments 
      for FRDA in recent years. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) has been shown to induce 
      frataxin production in many cell types. In this study, the clinical features, 
      tolerability, and the prognosis of individuals with FRDA to whom IFN-gamma was 
      administered in a university hospital were evaluated retrospectively and the 
      results were discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study 
      conducted in our country to evaluate the effect of IFN gamma on this patient 
      group.

LID - e12813
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia is a rare degenerative neuromuscular disorder, caused by a 
      homozygous GAA triplet repeat expansion in the frataxin (FXN) gene, with a broad 
      clinical phenotype characterized by progressive gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, 
      and loss of lower limb reflexes; cardiac involvement is represented by 
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac deaths. 
      Currently, no definite therapy is available, while many drugs are under 
      investigation; for this reasons, we need markers of short- and long-term 
      treatment efficacy acting on different tissue for trial evaluation. We describe 
      the case of a 21-year-old patient affected by Friedreich's ataxia on wheel-chair, 
      with initial cardiac involvement and electrocardiographic features characterized 
      by thiamine treatment-related negative T wave and QTc variations. We discuss 
      plausible physiopathology and potential ECG role implications as an intermediate 
      marker of treatment response in future clinical trials considering patients 
      affected by Friedreich's ataxia.

AB  - The molecular mechanisms of reduced frataxin (FXN) expression in Friedreich's 
      ataxia (FRDA) are linked to epigenetic modification of the FXN locus caused by 
      the disease-associated GAA expansion. Here, we identify that SUV4-20 histone 
      methyltransferases, specifically SUV4-20 H1, play an important role in the 
      regulation of FXN expression and represent a novel therapeutic target. Using a 
      human FXN-GAA-Luciferase repeat expansion genomic DNA reporter model of FRDA, we 
      screened the Structural Genomics Consortium epigenetic probe collection. We found 
      that pharmacological inhibition of the SUV4-20 methyltransferases by the tool 
      compound A-196 increased the expression of FXN by  approximately 1.5-fold in the reporter cell 
      line. In several FRDA cell lines and patient-derived primary peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells, A-196 increased FXN expression by up to 2-fold, an effect not 
      seen in WT cells. SUV4-20 inhibition was accompanied by a reduction in H4K20me2 
      and H4K20me3 and an increase in H4K20me1, but only modest (1.4-7.8%) perturbation 
      in genome-wide expression was observed. Finally, based on the structural activity 
      relationship and crystal structure of A-196, novel small molecule A-196 analogs 
      were synthesized and shown to give a 20-fold increase in potency for increasing 
      FXN expression. Overall, our results suggest that histone methylation is 
      important in the regulation of FXN expression and highlight SUV4-20 H1 as a 
      potential novel therapeutic target for FRDA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In rare disorders diagnosis may be delayed due to limited awareness 
      and unspecific presenting symptoms. Herein, we address the issue of diagnostic 
      delay in Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA), a genetic disorder usually caused by 
      homozygous GAA-repeat expansions. METHODS: Six hundred eleven genetically 
      confirmed FRDA patients were recruited within a multicentric natural history 
      study conducted by the EFACTS (European FRDA Consortium for Translational 
      Studies, ClinicalTrials.gov -Identifier NCT02069509). Age at first symptoms as 
      well as age at first suspicion of FRDA by a physician were collected 
      retrospectively at the baseline visit. RESULTS: In 554 of cases (90.7%), disease 
      presented with gait or coordination disturbances. In the others (n = 57, 9.3%), 
      non-neurological features such as scoliosis or cardiomyopathy predated ataxia. 
      Before the discovery of the causal mutation in 1996, median time to diagnosis was 
      4(IQR = 2-9) years and it improved significantly after the introduction of 
      genetic testing (2(IQR = 1-5) years, p < 0.001). Still, after 1996, time to 
      diagnosis was longer in patients with a) non-neurological presentation (mean 6.7, 
      95%CI [5.5,7.9] vs 4.5, [4.2,5] years in those with neurological presentation, 
      p = 0.001) as well as in b) patients with late-onset (3(IQR = 1-7) vs 
      2(IQR = 1-5) years compared to typical onset < 25 years of age, p = 0.03). Age at 
      onset significantly correlated with the length of the shorter GAA repeat (GAA1) 
      in case of neurological onset (r = - 0,6; p < 0,0001), but not in patients with 
      non-neurological presentation (r = - 0,1; p = 0,4). Across 54 siblings' pairs, 
      differences in age at onset did not correlate with differences in GAA-repeat 
      length (r = - 0,14, p = 0,3). CONCLUSIONS: In the genetic era, presentation with 
      non-neurological features or in the adulthood still leads to a significant 
      diagnostic delay in FRDA. Well-known correlations between GAA1 repeat length and 
      disease milestones are not valid in case of atypical presentations or positive 
      family history.

TI  - A Drosophila model of Friedreich ataxia with CRISPR/Cas9 insertion of GAA repeats 
      in the frataxin gene reveals in vivo protection by N-acetyl cysteine.
PG  - 2831-2844
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddaa170 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FA) is caused by GAA repeat expansions in the first intron of 
      FXN, the gene encoding frataxin, which results in decreased gene expression. 
      Thanks to the high degree of frataxin conservation, the Drosophila melanogaster 
      fruitfly appears as an adequate animal model to study this disease and to 
      evaluate therapeutic interventions. Here, we generated a Drosophila model of FA 
      with CRISPR/Cas9 insertion of approximately 200 GAA in the intron of the fly 
      frataxin gene fh. These flies exhibit a developmental delay and lethality 
      associated with decreased frataxin expression. We were able to bypass preadult 
      lethality using genetic tools to overexpress frataxin only during the 
      developmental period. These frataxin-deficient adults are short-lived and present 
      strong locomotor defects. RNA-Seq analysis identified deregulation of genes 
      involved in amino-acid metabolism and transcriptomic signatures of oxidative 
      stress. In particular, we observed a progressive increase of Tspo expression, 
      fully rescued by adult frataxin expression. Thus, Tspo expression constitutes a 
      molecular marker of the disease progression in our fly model and might be of 
      interest in other animal models or in patients. Finally, in a candidate drug 
      screening, we observed that N-acetyl cysteine improved the survival, locomotor 
      function, resistance to oxidative stress and aconitase activity of 
      frataxin-deficient flies. Therefore, our model provides the opportunity to 
      elucidate in vivo, the protective mechanisms of this molecule of therapeutic 
      potential. This study also highlights the strength of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology 
      to introduce human mutations in endogenous orthologous genes, leading to 
      Drosophila models of human diseases with improved physiological relevance.

TI  - Genome-wide detection of tandem DNA repeats that are expanded in autism.
PG  - 80-86
LID - 10.1038/s41586-020-2579-z [doi]
AB  - Tandem DNA repeats vary in the size and sequence of each unit (motif). When 
      expanded, these tandem DNA repeats have been associated with more than 40 
      monogenic disorders(1). Their involvement in disorders with complex genetics is 
      largely unknown, as is the extent of their heterogeneity. Here we investigated 
      the genome-wide characteristics of tandem repeats that had motifs with a length 
      of 2-20 base pairs in 17,231 genomes of families containing individuals with 
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD)(2,3) and population control individuals(4). We 
      found extensive polymorphism in the size and sequence of motifs. Many of the 
      tandem repeat loci that we detected correlated with cytogenetic fragile sites. At 
      2,588 loci, gene-associated expansions of tandem repeats that were rare among 
      population control individuals were significantly more prevalent among 
      individuals with ASD than their siblings without ASD, particularly in exons and 
      near splice junctions, and in genes related to the development of the nervous 
      system and cardiovascular system or muscle. Rare tandem repeat expansions had a 
      prevalence of 23.3% in children with ASD compared with 20.7% in children without 
      ASD, which suggests that tandem repeat expansions make a collective contribution 
      to the risk of ASD of 2.6%. These rare tandem repeat expansions included 
      previously undescribed ASD-linked expansions in DMPK and FXN, which are 
      associated with neuromuscular conditions, and in previously unknown loci such as 
      FGF14 and CACNB1. Rare tandem repeat expansions were associated with lower IQ and 
      adaptive ability. Our results show that tandem DNA repeat expansions contribute 
      strongly to the genetic aetiology and phenotypic complexity of ASD.

AB  - A new way to detect GAA trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) based on a solution-gated 
      graphene transistor (SGGT) with high performance was developed. Friedreich's 
      ataxia (FRDA) is a neurodegenerative disease where the first intron of the 
      frataxin (FXN) gene exhibits an extended GAA repeat region. Herein, a SGGT 
      biosensor was constructed based on G-quadruplex DNAzymes and graphene channels. 
      The DNAzymes quantify the captured target DNA by producing a strong catalytic 
      current signal depending on the peroxidase-like activity. The higher the target 
      DNA quantity captured on the gate electrode is, the higher is the concentration 
      of DNAzymes on the surface of the gate electrode, which generates a high 
      catalytic current. Due to the excellent self-amplifying performance of the 
      transistor, the current signal of the SGGT is several hundreds of times larger 
      than in conventional electrochemistry under identical detection conditions. 
      Moreover, a large current signal can be obtained in the case of a low 
      concentration of H(2)O(2) when compared to the case of an enzyme-catalyzed 
      transistor. The SGGT biosensor also exhibits an ultra-low detection limit (32.25 
      fM), a wide linear range (100 fM-100 nM), and excellent selectivity. The results 
      show that the SGGT biosensor has great potential in the early diagnosis of 
      neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Mitochondrial damage and senescence phenotype of cells derived from a novel 
      frataxin G127V point mutation mouse model of Friedreich's ataxia.
LID - 10.1242/dmm.045229 [doi]
LID - dmm045229
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin (FXN). Most 
      FRDA patients are homozygous for large expansions of GAA repeat sequences in 
      intron 1 of FXN, whereas a fraction of patients are compound heterozygotes, with 
      a missense or nonsense mutation in one FXN allele and expanded GAAs in the other. 
      A prevalent missense mutation among FRDA patients changes a glycine at 
      position 130 to valine (G130V). Herein, we report generation of the first mouse 
      model harboring an Fxn point mutation. Changing the evolutionarily conserved 
      glycine 127 in mouse Fxn to valine results in a failure-to-thrive phenotype in 
      homozygous animals and a substantially reduced number of offspring. Like G130V in 
      FRDA, the G127V mutation results in a dramatic decrease of Fxn protein without 
      affecting transcript synthesis or splicing. Fxn(G127V) mouse embryonic 
      fibroblasts exhibit significantly reduced proliferation and increased cell 
      senescence. These defects are evident in early passage cells and are exacerbated 
      at later passages. Furthermore, increased frequency of mitochondrial DNA lesions 
      and fragmentation are accompanied by marked amplification of mitochondrial DNA in 
      Fxn(G127V) cells. Bioenergetics analyses demonstrate higher sensitivity and 
      reduced cellular respiration of Fxn(G127V) cells upon alteration of fatty acid 
      availability. Importantly, substitution of Fxn(WT) with Fxn(G127V) is compatible 
      with life, and cellular proliferation defects can be rescued by mitigation of 
      oxidative stress via hypoxia or induction of the NRF2 pathway. We propose 
      Fxn(G127V) cells as a simple and robust model for testing therapeutic approaches 
      for FRDA.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      a homozygous GAA repeat expansion mutation in intron 1 of the frataxin gene 
      (FXN), which instigates reduced transcription. As a consequence, reduced levels 
      of frataxin protein lead to mitochondrial iron accumulation, oxidative stress, 
      and ultimately cell death; particularly in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory 
      neurons and the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum. In addition to neurological 
      disability, FRDA is associated with cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, and 
      skeletal deformities. Currently there is no effective treatment for FRDA and 
      patients die prematurely. Recent findings suggest that abnormal GAA expansion 
      plays a role in histone modification, subjecting the FXN gene to heterochromatin 
      silencing. Therefore, as an epigenetic-based therapy, we investigated the 
      efficacy and tolerability of two histone methyltransferase (HMTase) inhibitor 
      compounds, BIX0194 (G9a-inhibitor) and GSK126 (EZH2-inhibitor), to specifically 
      target and reduce H3K9me2/3 and H3K27me3 levels, respectively, in FRDA 
      fibroblasts. We show that a combination treatment of BIX0194 and GSK126, 
      significantly increased FXN gene expression levels and reduced the repressive 
      histone marks. However, no increase in frataxin protein levels was observed. 
      Nevertheless, our results are still promising and may encourage to investigate 
      HMTase inhibitors with other synergistic epigenetic-based therapies for further 
      preliminary studies.

TI  - Significance of NT-proBNP and High-sensitivity Troponin in Friedreich Ataxia.
LID - 10.3390/jcm9061630 [doi]
LID - 1630
AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive mitochondrial 
      disease resulting of a triplet repeat expansion guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) in 
      the frataxin (FXN) gene, exhibiting progressive cerebellar ataxia, diabetes and 
      cardiomyopathy. We aimed to determine the relationship between cardiac 
      biomarkers, serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and serum 
      cardiac high-sensitivity troponin (hsTnT) concentrations, and the extent of 
      genetic abnormality and cardiac parameters. METHODS: Between 2013 and 2015, 85 
      consecutive genetically confirmed FA adult patients were prospectively evaluated 
      by measuring plasma hsTnT and NT-proBNP concentrations, electrocardiogram, and 
      echocardiography. RESULTS: The 85 FA patients (49% women) with a mean age of 39 +/- 
      12 years, a mean disease onset of 17 +/- 11 years had a mean SARA (Scale for the 
      Assessment and Rating of Ataxia) score of 26 +/- 10. The median hsTnT concentration 
      was 10 ng/L (3 to 85 ng/L) and 34% had a significant elevated hsTnT >/= 14 ng/L. 
      Increased septal wall thickness was associated with increased hsTnT plasma levels 
      (p < 0.001). The median NT-proBNP concentration was 31 ng/L (5 to 775 ng/L) and 
      14% had significant elevated NT-proBNP >/= 125 ng/L. Markers of increased left 
      ventricular filling pressure (trans mitral E/A and lateral E/E' ratio) were 
      associated with increased NT-proBNP plasma levels (p = 0.01 and p = 0.01). Length 
      of GAA or the SARA score were not associated with hsTnT or NT-proBNP plasma 
      levels. CONCLUSION: hsTnT was increased in 1/3 of the adult FA and associated 
      with increased septal wall thickness. Increased NT-proBNP remained a marker of 
      increased left ventricular filling pressure. This could be used to identify 
      patients that should undergo a closer cardiac surveillance.

TI  - Neurofilament light chain as a potential biomarker of disease status in

AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study evaluates serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) as 
      a biomarker of disease features in Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). METHODS: NfL 
      levels from serum of 117 subjects (85 FRDA patients, 13 carriers, and 19 
      controls) were assayed and correlated with disease features such as smaller GAA 
      repeat length (GAA1), age, sex, and level of neurological dysfunction. RESULTS: 
      Mean serum NfL levels were higher in FRDA patients than in carriers or unaffected 
      controls in two independent cohorts of subjects. In longitudinal samples from 
      FRDA patients drawn monthly or 1 year apart, values changed minimally. No 
      difference was noted between carriers and controls. NfL levels correlated 
      positively with age in controls and carriers of similar age, (Rs = 0.72, 
      p < 0.0005), whereas NfL levels inversely correlated with age in FRDA patients 
      (Rs =  - 0.63, p < 0.001). NfL levels were not associated with sex or GAA1 length 
      in patients, and linear regression revealed a significant relationship between 
      NfL levels in the cohort with age (coefficient =  - 0.36, p < 0.001), but not sex 
      (p = 0.64) or GAA1 (p = 0.13). CONCLUSION: Because NfL is elevated in patients, 
      but decreases with age and disease progression, our results suggest that age is 
      the critical determinant of NfL in FRDA (rather than clinical or genetic 
      severity).

TI  - A Comprehensive Transcriptome Analysis Identifies FXN and BDNF as Novel Targets 
      of miRNAs in Friedreich's Ataxia Patients.
PG  - 2639-2653
LID - 10.1007/s12035-020-01899-1 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease that is caused 
      by guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) nucleotide repeat expansions in the first intron 
      of the frataxin (FXN) gene. Although present in the intron, this mutation leads 
      to a substantial decrease in protein expression. Currently, no effective 
      treatment is available for FRDA, and, in addition to FXN, other targets with 
      therapeutic potential are continuously sought. As miRNAs can regulate the 
      expression of a broad spectrum of genes, are used as biomarkers, and can serve as 
      therapeutic tools, we decided to identify and characterize differentially 
      expressed miRNAs and their targets in FRDA cells compared to unaffected control 
      (CTRL) cells. In this study, we performed an integrated miRNAseq and RNAseq 
      analysis using the same cohort of primary FRDA and CTRL cells. The results of the 
      transcriptome studies were supported by bioinformatic analyses and validated by 
      qRT-PCR. miRNA interactions with target genes were assessed by luciferase assays, 
      qRT-PCR, and immunoblotting. In silico analysis identified the FXN transcript as 
      a target of five miRNAs upregulated in FRDA cells. Further studies confirmed that 
      miRNA-224-5p indeed targets FXN, resulting in decreases in mRNA and protein 
      levels. We also validated the ability of miRNA-10a-5p to bind and regulate the 
      levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), an important modulator of 
      neuronal growth. We observed a significant decrease in the levels of miRNA-10a-5p 
      and increase in the levels of BDNF upon correction of FRDA cells via zinc-finger 
      nuclease (ZFN)-mediated excision of expanded GAA repeats. Our comprehensive 
      transcriptome analyses identified miRNA-224-5p and miRNA-10a-5p as negative 
      regulators of the FXN and BDNF expression, respectively. These results emphasize 
      not only the importance of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of FRDA but also their 
      potential as therapeutic targets for this disease.

TI  - Large-scale contractions of Friedreich's ataxia GAA repeats in yeast occur during 
      DNA replication due to their triplex-forming ability.
PG  - 1628-1637
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1913416117 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a human hereditary disease caused by the presence 
      of expanded (GAA)(n) repeats in the first intron of the FXN gene [V. Campuzano et 
      al., Science 271, 1423-1427 (1996)]. In somatic tissues of FRDA patients, 
      (GAA)(n) repeat tracts are highly unstable, with contractions more common than 
      expansions [R. Sharma et al., Hum. Mol. Genet. 11, 2175-2187 (2002)]. Here we 
      describe an experimental system to characterize GAA repeat contractions in yeast 
      and to conduct a genetic analysis of this process. We found that large-scale 
      contraction is a one-step process, resulting in a median loss of  approximately 60 triplet 
      repeats. Our genetic analysis revealed that contractions occur during DNA 
      replication, rather than by various DNA repair pathways. Repeats contract in the 
      course of lagging-strand synthesis: The processivity subunit of DNA polymerase delta, 
      Pol32, and the catalytic domain of Rev1, a translesion polymerase, act together 
      in the same pathway to counteract contractions. Accumulation of single-stranded 
      DNA (ssDNA) in the lagging-strand template greatly increases the probability that 
      (GAA)(n) repeats contract, which in turn promotes repeat instability in rfa1, 
      rad27, and dna2 mutants. Finally, by comparing contraction rates for 
      homopurine-homopyrimidine repeats differing in their mirror symmetry, we found 
      that contractions depend on a repeat's triplex-forming ability. We propose that 
      accumulation of ssDNA in the lagging-strand template fosters the formation of a 
      triplex between the nascent and fold-back template strands of the repeat. 
      Occasional jumps of DNA polymerase through this triplex hurdle, result in repeat 
      contractions in the nascent lagging strand.

TI  - Multiple mechanisms underpin cerebral and cerebellar white matter deficits in 
      Friedreich ataxia: The IMAGE-FRDA study.
PG  - 1920-1933
LID - 10.1002/hbm.24921 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with reported 
      abnormalities in cerebellar, brainstem, and cerebral white matter. White matter 
      structure can be measured using in vivo neuroimaging indices sensitive to 
      different white matter features. For the first time, we examined the relative 
      sensitivity and relationship between multiple white matter indices in Friedreich 
      ataxia to more richly characterize disease expression and infer possible 
      mechanisms underlying the observed white matter abnormalities. Diffusion-tensor, 
      magnetization transfer, and T1-weighted structural images were acquired from 31 
      individuals with Friedreich ataxia and 36 controls. Six white matter indices were 
      extracted: fractional anisotropy, diffusivity (mean, axial, radial), 
      magnetization transfer ratio (microstructure), and volume (macrostructure). For 
      each index, whole-brain voxel-wise between-group comparisons and correlations 
      with disease severity, onset age, and gene triplet-repeat length were undertaken. 
      Correlations between pairs of indices were assessed in the Friedreich ataxia 
      cohort. Spatial similarities in the voxel-level pattern of between-group 
      differences across the indices were also assessed. Microstructural abnormalities 
      were maximal in cerebellar and brainstem regions, but evident throughout the 
      brain, while macroscopic abnormalities were restricted to the brainstem. Poorer 
      microstructure and reduced macrostructural volume correlated with greater disease 
      severity and earlier onset, particularly in peri-dentate nuclei and brainstem 
      regions. Microstructural and macrostructural abnormalities were largely 
      independent. Reduced fractional anisotropy was most strongly associated with 
      axial diffusivity in cerebral tracts, and magnetization transfer in cerebellar 
      tracts. Multiple mechanisms likely underpin white matter abnormalities in 
      Friedreich ataxia, with differential impacts in cerebellar and cerebral pathways.

      Friedreich ataxia.

AB  - Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease associated 
      with a high diabetes prevalence. No treatment is available to prevent or delay 
      disease progression. Friedreich ataxia is caused by intronic GAA trinucleotide 
      repeat expansions in the frataxin-encoding FXN gene that reduce frataxin 
      expression, impair iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, cause oxidative stress, and 
      result in mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Here we examined the 
      metabolic, neuroprotective, and frataxin-inducing effects of glucagon-like 
      peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs in in vivo and in vitro models and in patients with 
      Friedreich ataxia. The GLP-1 analog exenatide improved glucose homeostasis of 
      frataxin-deficient mice through enhanced insulin content and secretion in 
      pancreatic beta cells. Exenatide induced frataxin and iron-sulfur cluster-containing 
      proteins in beta cells and brain and was protective to sensory neurons in dorsal 
      root ganglia. GLP-1 analogs also induced frataxin expression, reduced oxidative 
      stress, and improved mitochondrial function in Friedreich ataxia patients' 
      induced pluripotent stem cell-derived beta cells and sensory neurons. The 
      frataxin-inducing effect of exenatide was confirmed in a pilot trial in 
      Friedreich ataxia patients, showing modest frataxin induction in platelets over a 
      5-week treatment course. Taken together, GLP-1 analogs improve mitochondrial 
      function in frataxin-deficient cells and induce frataxin expression. Our findings 
      identify incretin receptors as a therapeutic target in Friedreich ataxia.

TI  - The first biallelic missense mutation in the FXN gene in a consanguineous Turkish 
      family with Charcot-Marie-Tooth-like phenotype.
PG  - 73-78
LID - 10.1007/s10048-019-00594-1 [doi]
AB  - Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is the most common inherited neuropathy with a 
      prevalence of 1 in 2500 individuals worldwide. Here, we report three Turkish 
      siblings from consanguineous parents presenting with a CMT-like phenotype who 
      carry a homozygous c.493C>T, p.Arg165Cys mutation in the FXN gene that is the 
      only known causative gene for Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). The identified missense 
      mutation has been reported previously in two FRDA cases in compound 
      heterozygosity with the common GAA repeat expansion in the first intron of the 
      FXN gene. Analysis of skin biopsy samples from our family indicated that the 
      mutation does not affect the expression levels of the frataxin, pointing to 
      functional impairment of the corresponding protein. The CMT phenotype in the 
      siblings was associated with visual impairment, optic nerve atrophy, and 
      dysarthria. To the best of our knowledge, this family represents the first FXN 
      missense mutation in homozygosity and challenges the notion that missense 
      mutations have not been reported yet due to their embryonic lethality. 
      Furthermore, this finding poses an interesting genetic overlap between autosomal 
      recessive CMT and FRDA that we believe may have important implications on 
      understanding the pathogenesis of these neurological disorders.

TI  - Predictors of Left Ventricular Dysfunction in Friedreich's Ataxia in a 16-Year 
      Observational Study.
PG  - 209-216

AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a cerebellar ataxia due to GAA repeat 
      expansions in the FXN gene, and in affected patients, lower left ventricular 
      ejection fraction (LVEF) leads to poorer prognosis. We aimed to identify patients 
      likely to develop worsening LVEF at an early stage. METHODS: We included 115 FRDA 
      patients aged 30 +/- 10 years with 620 +/- 238 GAA repeats on the shorter allele and 
      disease onset of 15 +/- 7 years. RESULTS: At baseline, left ventricular (LV) 
      hypertrophy was present in 53%, with LVEF 65 +/- 7%, LV end diastolic diameter 
      (LVEDD) 43 +/- 5 mm, septal wall thickness (SWT) 11.8 +/- 2.7 mm, and posterior wall 
      thickness 11.1 +/- 2.5 mm. After a mean follow-up of 13 +/- 6 years, LVEF </= 50% was 
      observed in 12 patients. The main determinants of LVEF </= 50% were GAA repeat 
      number on the shorter allele (odds ratio [OR] 1.007, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      1.003-1.012, p = 0.002), LVEDD (OR 1.217, 95% CI 1.058-1.399, p = 0.006), and SWT 
      (OR 1.352, 95% CI 1.016-1.799, p = 0.04). High-risk patients were predicted 
      5 years before LVEF </= 50% occurred: area under the curve of 0.91, 95% CI 
      0.85-0.97. Patients with GAA repeats > 800 were categorized as high risk, 
      patients with 500 < GAA < 800 were high risk if LVEDD was >/= 52.6 mm and SWT 
      was >/= 13.3 mm, and patients with GAA < 500 were low risk if LVEDD was < 52.6 mm 
      and SWT was < 13.3 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiographic follow-up combined with 
      size assessment of GAA repeat expansions is a powerful tool to identify patients 
      at high risk of developing LV systolic dysfunction up to 5 years before clinical 
      symptoms. Further studies are mandatory to investigate if these patients would 
      benefit from cardiac interventions.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia is caused by large homozygous, intronic expansions of GAA 
      repeats in the frataxin (FXN) gene, resulting in severe downregulation of its 
      expression. Pathogenic repeats are located in intron one, hence patients express 
      unaffected FXN protein, albeit in low quantities. Although FRDA symptoms 
      typically afflict the nervous system, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the 
      predominant cause of death. Our studies were conducted using cardiomyocytes 
      differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from control 
      individuals, FRDA patients, and isogenic cells corrected by zinc finger 
      nucleases-mediated excision of pathogenic expanded GAA repeats. This correction 
      of the FXN gene removed the primary trigger of the transcription defect, 
      upregulated frataxin expression, reduced pathological lipid accumulation observed 
      in patient cardiomyocytes, and reversed gene expression signatures of FRDA 
      cardiomyocytes. Transcriptome analyses revealed hypertrophy-specific expression 
      signatures unique to FRDA cardiomyocytes, and emphasized similarities between 
      unaffected and ZFN-corrected FRDA cardiomyocytes. Thus, the iPSC-derived FRDA 
      cardiomyocytes exhibit various molecular defects characteristic for cellular 
      models of cardiomyopathy that can be corrected by genome editing of the expanded 
      GAA repeats. These results underscore the utility of genome editing in generating 
      isogenic cellular models of FRDA and the potential of this approach as a future 
      therapy for this disease.

AB  - Frataxin is the protein that is down-regulated in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), an 
      autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by an intronic GAA repeat expansion in 
      intron-1 of the FXN gene. The GAA repeats result in epigenetic silencing of the 
      FXN gene and reduced expression of the cytosolic full-length frataxin (1-210) 
      protein. Full length frataxin translocates to the mitochondria, leading to 
      formation of mature frataxin (81-210) formed by cleavage of the mitochondrial 
      targeting sequence at K-80 of the full-length protein. There are currently no 
      approved treatments for FRDA, although experimental approaches involving 
      up-regulation or replacement of mature frataxin protein through numerous 
      approaches are being tested. Many of the pre-clinical studies of these 
      experimental approaches are conducted in mouse and monkey models as well as in 
      human cell lines. Consequently, well-validated antibodies are required for use in 
      western blot analysis to determine whether levels of various forms of frataxin 
      have been increased. Here we examined the specificity of five commercially 
      available anti-frataxin antibodies and determined whether they detect mature 
      frataxin in mouse heart tissue. Four protein standards of monkey, human, and 
      mouse frataxin as well as mouse heart tissue were examined using polyacrylamide 
      gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in combination with western blot analysis. One 
      antibody failed to detect any of the frataxin standards or endogenous frataxin in 
      mouse heart tissue. Three of the antibodies detected a protein in mouse heart 
      tissue that ran slightly faster on PAGE (at 23.4...kDa) to that predicted for 
      full-length frataxin (23.9...kDa). One antibody detected all four frataxin 
      standards as well as endogenous mouse mature frataxin in mouse tissue. 
      Significantly, this antibody, which will be useful for monitoring mature frataxin 
      levels in monkey, human, and mouse tissues, did not detect a protein in mouse 
      heart tissue at 23.4...kDa. Therefore, antibodies detecting the immunoreactive 
      protein at 23.4...kDa could be misleading when testing for the up-regulation of 
      frataxin in animal models.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      trinucleotide (GAA) repeat expansion in frataxin (fxn) gene which results in 
      decreased levels of frataxin protein. Insufficient frataxin levels leads to iron 
      and copper deposits in the brain and cardiac cells. A total of hundred and twenty 
      patients, suspected of FRDA were screened for the (GAA) repeats in the fxn gene 
      and only confirmed patients (n = 25) were recruited in the study. The total Iron 
      and total copper concentrations were measured in blood plasma using Nitro PAPS 
      and Dibrom PAESA method, respectively both in patients and age, sex matched 
      healthy controls. The iron levels mean +/- SD (6.2 +/- 3.8) in plasma of FRDA 
      patients were found to be significantly decreased as compared to healthy controls 
      mean +/- SD (15.2 +/- 4.2). A similar trend was observed in case of plasma copper 
      levels in FRDA patient (8.15 +/- 4.6) as compared to controls (17.5 +/- 3.40). 
      Present results clearly prove abnormal distribution of extra-cellular iron in 
      FRDA patients, which is in accordance with the well established fact of 
      intracellular iron overload, which is the key feature of the pathogenesis of this 
      disease. This can be of importance in understanding the pathophysiology of the 
      disease in association with frataxin/iron. It appears that intracellular 
      sequestration of trace metals in FRDA patients (due to low frataxin) results in 
      their sub-optimal levels in blood plasma (extra-cellular) an observation that can 
      find prognostic application in clinical trials.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive multisystem 
      disease mainly affecting the peripheral and central nervous systems, and heart. 
      FRDA is caused by a GAA repeat expansion in the first intron of the frataxin 
      (FXN) gene, that leads to reduced expression of FXN mRNA and frataxin protein. 
      Neuronal and cardiac cells are primary targets of frataxin deficiency and 
      generating models via differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) 
      into these cell types is essential for progress towards developing therapies for 
      FRDA. AREAS COVERED: This review is focused on modeling FRDA using human iPSCs 
      and various iPSC-differentiated cell types. We emphasized the importance of 
      patient and corrected isogenic cell line pairs to minimize effects caused by 
      biological variability between individuals. EXPERT OPINION: The versatility of 
      iPSC-derived cellular models of FRDA is advantageous for developing new 
      therapeutic strategies, and rigorous testing in such models will be critical for 
      approval of the first treatment for FRDA. Creating a well-characterized and 
      diverse set of iPSC lines, including appropriate isogenic controls, will 
      facilitate achieving this goal. Also, improvement of differentiation protocols, 
      especially towards proprioceptive sensory neurons and organoid generation, is 
      necessary to utilize the full potential of iPSC technology in the drug discovery 
      process.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an unstable 
      GAA repeat expansion within intron 1 of the FXN gene and characterized by 
      peripheral neuropathy. A major feature of FRDA is frataxin deficiency with the 
      loss of large sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), namely 
      proprioceptive neurons, undergoing dying-back neurodegeneration with progression 
      to posterior columns of the spinal cord and cerebellar ataxia. We used isolated 
      DRGs from a YG8R FRDA mouse model and C57BL/6J control mice for a proteomic study 
      and a primary culture of sensory neurons from DRG to test novel pharmacological 
      strategies. We found a decreased expression of electron transport chain (ETC) 
      proteins, the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system and antioxidant enzymes, 
      confirming a clear impairment in mitochondrial function and an oxidative 
      stress-prone phenotype. The proteomic profile also showed a decreased expression 
      in Ca(2+) signaling related proteins and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 
      These receptors modulate intracellular cAMP/cGMP and Ca(2+) levels. Treatment of 
      frataxin-deficient sensory neurons with phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors was 
      able to restore improper cytosolic Ca(2+) levels and revert the axonal dystrophy 
      found in DRG neurons of YG8R mice. In conclusion, the present study shows the 
      effectiveness of PDE inhibitors against axonal degeneration of sensory neurons in 
      YG8R mice. Our findings indicate that PDE inhibitors may become a future FRDA 
      pharmacological treatment.

TI  - Ferroptosis as a Novel Therapeutic Target for Friedreich's Ataxia.

AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive neuro- and cardio-degenerative disorder 
      characterized by ataxia, sensory loss, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In most 
      cases, the disorder is caused by GAA repeat expansions in the first introns of 
      both alleles of the FXN gene, resulting in decreased expression of the encoded 
      protein, frataxin. Frataxin localizes to the mitochondrial matrix and is required 
      for iron-sulfur-cluster biosynthesis. Decreased expression of frataxin is 
      associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, mitochondrial iron accumulation, and 
      increased oxidative stress. Ferropotosis is a recently identified pathway of 
      regulated, iron-dependent cell death, which is biochemically distinct from 
      apoptosis. We evaluated whether there is evidence for ferroptotic pathway 
      activation in cellular models of FRDA. We found that primary patient-derived 
      fibroblasts, murine fibroblasts with FRDA-associated mutations, and murine 
      fibroblasts in which a repeat expansion had been introduced (knockin/knockout) 
      were more sensitive than normal control cells to erastin, a known ferroptosis 
      inducer. We also found that the ferroptosis inhibitors ethyl 
      3-(benzylamino)-4-(cyclohexylamino)benzoate (SRS11-92) and ethyl 
      3-amino-4-(cyclohexylamino)benzoate, used at 500 nM, were efficacious in 
      protecting human and mouse cellular models of FRDA treated with ferric ammonium 
      citrate (FAC) and an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis [L-buthionine 
      (S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO)], whereas caspase-3 inhibitors failed to show significant 
      biologic activity. Cells treated with FAC and BSO consistently showed decreased 
      glutathione-dependent peroxidase activity and increased lipid peroxidation, both 
      hallmarks of ferroptosis. Finally, the ferroptosis inhibitor SRS11-92 decreased 
      the cell death associated with frataxin knockdown in healthy human fibroblasts. 
      Taken together, these data suggest that ferroptosis inhibitors may have 
      therapeutic potential in FRDA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative 
      condition which also has effects on the heart. In 96% of affected individuals 
      FRDA is due to homozygosity of a GAA repeat expansion in intron 1 of the frataxin 
      (FXN) gene. The number of GAA repeats have been shown to relate to disease 
      severity in FRDA, this thought to be via an inverse relationship of GAA repeat 
      number and cellular frataxin levels. We investigated the effects of FRDA on 
      regional long axis function of the left and right ventricles, and also the 
      relationship of long axis systolic (s;) and early diastolic (e;) peak velocities 
      with GAA repeat number on the shorter (GAA1) and longer FXN alleles (GAA2). 
      METHODS: The study group of 78 adult subjects (age 32+/-9 years) with FRDA and 
      normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction were compared to 54 healthy 
      control subjects of similar age, sex and body size. Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) 
      signals were recorded at the mitral annulus for measurement of s;and e;of the 
      septal, lateral, anterior and inferior walls and at the tricuspid annulus for 
      measurement of right ventricular (RV) s;and e;. RESULTS: All the regional LV 
      s;and e;, and both RV s;and RV e;, were lower in individuals with FRDA compared 
      to controls (p<0.001 for all). On multivariate analysis, which included LV septal 
      wall thickness (SWT), RV s;and RV e;were both inversely correlated with GAA1 (beta = 
      -0.32 & -0.33, respectively, p = 0.01), but not with GAA2, whereas anterior and 
      lateral s;were both inversely correlated with GAA2 (beta = -0.25 and beta = -0.28, p = 
      0.02) but not with GAA1. Increasing SWT was the most consistent LV structural 
      correlate of lower s;and e;, whereas age was a consistent inverse correlate of 
      e;but not of s;. CONCLUSION: There are generalized abnormalities of both LV 
      regional and RV long axis function in FRDA, but there are also regional 
      differences in the association of this dysfunction with the smaller and larger 
      GAA repeats in the FXN gene.

TI  - GRP75 overexpression rescues frataxin deficiency and mitochondrial phenotypes in 
      Friedreich ataxia cellular models.
PG  - 1594-1607
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddy448 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by the deficiency of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein crucial for 
      iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. 
      Currently, there is no therapy to slow down the progression of FRDA. Recent 
      evidence indicates that posttranslational regulation of residual frataxin levels 
      can rescue some of the functional deficit of FRDA, raising the possibility of 
      enhancing levels of residual frataxin as a treatment for FRDA. Here, we present 
      evidence that mitochondrial molecular chaperone GRP75, also known as 
      mortalin/mthsp70/PBP74, directly interacts with frataxin both in vivo in mouse 
      cortex and in vitro in cortical neurons. Overexpressing GRP75 increases the 
      levels of both wild-type frataxin and clinically relevant missense frataxin 
      variants in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, while clinical GRP75 variants such 
      as R126W, A476T and P509S impair the binding of GRP75 with frataxin and the 
      effect of GRP75 on frataxin levels. In addition, GRP75 overexpression rescues 
      frataxin deficiency and abnormal cellular phenotypes such as the abnormal 
      mitochondrial network and decreased ATP levels in FRDA patient-derived cells. The 
      effect of GRP75 on frataxin might be in part mediated by the physical interaction 
      between GRP75 and mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP), which makes frataxin 
      more accessible to MPP. As GRP75 levels are decreased in multiple cell types of 
      FRDA patients, restoring GRP75 might be effective in treating both typical FRDA 
      patients with two guanine-adenine-adenine repeat expansions and compound 
      heterozygous patients with point mutations.

AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      transcriptional silencing of the frataxin (FXN) gene, resulting in loss of the 
      essential mitochondrial protein frataxin. Based on the knowledge that a GAA.TTC 
      repeat expansion in the first intron of FXN induces heterochromatin, we 
      previously showed that 2-aminobenzamide-type histone deacetylase inhibitors 
      (HDACi) increase FXN mRNA levels in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived 
      FRDA neurons and in circulating lymphocytes from patients after HDACi oral 
      administration. How the reduced expression of frataxin leads to neurological and 
      other systemic symptoms in FRDA patients remains unclear. Similar to other 
      triplet-repeat disorders, it is unknown why FRDA affects only specific cell 
      types, primarily the large sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia and 
      cardiomyocytes. The combination of iPSC technology and genome-editing techniques 
      offers the unique possibility to address these questions in a relevant cell model 
      of FRDA, obviating confounding effects of variable genetic backgrounds. Here, 
      using "scarless" gene-editing methods, we created isogenic iPSC lines that differ 
      only in the length of the GAA.TTC repeats. To uncover the gene expression 
      signatures due to the GAA.TTC repeat expansion in FRDA neuronal cells and the 
      effect of HDACi on these changes, we performed RNA-seq-based transcriptomic 
      analysis of iPSC-derived central nervous system (CNS) and isogenic sensory 
      neurons. We found that cellular pathways related to neuronal function, regulation 
      of transcription, extracellular matrix organization, and apoptosis are affected 
      by frataxin loss in neurons of the CNS and peripheral nervous system and that 
      these changes are partially restored by HDACi treatment.

AB  - Friedreich ataxia is a multi-system autosomal recessive inherited disorder 
      primarily caused by homozygous GAA repeat expansion mutations within intron 1 of 
      the frataxin gene. The resulting deficiency of frataxin protein leads to 
      progressive mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and cell death, with the 
      main affected sites being the large sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia 
      and the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum. The GAA repeat expansions may be pure 
      (GAA)(n) in sequence or may be interrupted with regions of non-GAA sequence. To 
      our knowledge, there has been no large-scale study of FRDA patient DNA samples to 
      determine the frequency of large interruptions in GAA repeat expansions. 
      Therefore, we have investigated a panel of 245 Friedreich ataxia patient and 
      carrier DNA samples using GAA repeat PCR amplification and MboII restriction 
      enzyme digestion. We demonstrate that the vast majority (97.8%) of Friedreich 
      ataxia GAA repeat expansion samples do not contain significant sequence changes 
      that would result in abnormal MboII digestion profiles, indicating that they are 
      primarily pure GAA repeats. These results show for the first time that large 
      interruptions in the GAA repeats are very rare.

LID - 17217
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a multisystem genetic disorder caused by GAA repeat 
      expansion mutations within the FXN gene, resulting in heterochromatin formation 
      and deficiency of frataxin protein. Elevated levels of the FXN antisense 
      transcript (FAST-1) have previously been detected in FRDA. To investigate the 
      effects of FAST-1 on the FXN gene expression, we first stably overexpressed 
      FAST-1 in non-FRDA cell lines and then we knocked down FAST-1 in FRDA fibroblast 
      cells. We observed decreased FXN expression in each FAST-1 overexpressing cell 
      type compared to control cells. We also found that FAST-1 overexpression is 
      associated with both CCCTC-Binding Factor (CTCF) depletion and heterochromatin 
      formation at the 5'UTR of the FXN gene. We further showed that knocking down 
      FAST-1 in FRDA fibroblast cells significantly increased FXN expression. Our 
      results indicate that FAST-1 can act in trans in a similar manner to the 
      cis-acting FAST-1 overexpression that has previously been identified in FRDA 
      fibroblasts. The effects of stably transfected FAST-1 expression on CTCF 
      occupancy and heterochromatin formation at the FXN locus suggest a direct role 
      for FAST-1 in the FRDA molecular disease mechanism. Our findings also support the 
      hypothesis that inhibition of FAST-1 may be a potential approach for FRDA 
      therapy.

AB  - Background: Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is the most common autosomal recessive 
      ataxia. Disease-modifying treatments are not available yet; however, several 
      compounds are currently under investigation. As a result, there is a growing need 
      for the identification of robust and easily accessible biomarkers for the 
      monitoring of disease activity and therapeutic efficacy. The simultaneous 
      measurement of multiple brain-derived proteins could represent a time- and 
      cost-efficient approach for biomarker investigation in pathologically complex 
      neurodegenerative diseases like FRDA. Objectives: To investigate the role of 
      plasma neurofilament-light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), 
      total tau (t-tau) and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1(UCHL1) as biomarkers in 
      FRDA. Additionally, NfL measurements derived from the novel multiplex assay were 
      compared to those from an established NfL singleplex assay. Methods: In this 
      study, an ultrasensitive Single molecule array (Simoa) 4-plex assay was used for 
      the measurement of plasma NfL, GFAP, t-tau, and UCHL1 in 33 FRDA patients and 13 
      age-matched controls. Differences in biomarker concentrations between these 
      groups were computed and associations with genetic and disease related parameters 
      investigated. Additionally, the agreement between NfL measurements derived from 
      the 4-Plex and an established Simoa NfL singleplex assay was assessed. Results: 
      Mean plasma NfL, GFAP and UCHL1 levels were significantly higher in FRDA patients 
      than in controls (NfL: p < 0.001; GFAP: p = 0.006, and UCHL1: p = 0.020). 
      Conversely, there was no significant difference in concentrations of t-tau in the 
      patient and control group (p = 0.236). None of the proteins correlated with the 
      GAA repeat length or the employed measures of disease severity. The individual 
      NfL values derived from the two assays showed a strong concordance (r(c) = 0.93). 
      Although the mean difference of 1.29 pg/mL differed significantly from 0 (p = 
      0.006), regression analysis did not indicate the presence of a proportional bias. 
      Conclusion: This is the first study demonstrating that NfL, GFAP, and UCHL1 
      levels are raised in FRDA, potentially reflecting ongoing neuronal degeneration 
      and glial activation. Further studies are required to determine their role as 
      marker for disease activity and progression. Furthermore, the novel 4-plex assay 
      appears to be a valid tool to simultaneously measure brain-derived proteins at 
      extremely low concentrations in the peripheral circulation.

TI  - Intraepidermal Nerve Fiber Density in Friedreich's Ataxia.
PG  - 1137-1143
LID - 10.1093/jnen/nly100 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA) is caused by a homozygous intronic GAA expansion in 
      the FXN gene. FRDA affects primarily the peripheral nervous system (PNS) with 
      cumulative evidence from postmortem studies and in vitro models suggesting a 
      developmental component of its pathology. In the present study, we aimed at 
      gaining further insight in the PNS involvement in FRDA by investigating small 
      nerve fibers in vivo. For this purpose, we evaluated the intraepidermal nerve 
      fiber (IENF) density in skin-biopsies of the lower leg and applied clinical 
      assessments of small fiber function (painDETECT, quantitative sensory testing) in 
      17 FRDAs. Mean IENF density was significantly lower in FRDAs compared to controls 
      (5.77 +/- 4.68 vs 9.33 +/- 1.41, p = 0.013). Clinically, cold detection threshold was 
      decreased in FRDAs (FRDA = -3.47(-6.64; -3.14), controls = -1.71 (-3.43; -1.23), 
      p = 0.001) while other measures of small fiber function such as warm and pain 
      sensation thresholds did not differ from controls. Five patients had sensory 
      complaints, but none was diagnosed with neuropathic pain at painDETECT. The 
      degree of small fiber loss was markedly variable in our cohort and showed an 
      inverse correlation with the GAA repeat length (R2 = 0.573, p = 0.001). Our 
      findings support a genetically determined small fiber loss in FRDA.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a rare hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused 
      by a GAA repeat expansion in the FXN gene. There is still no cure or quantitative 
      biomarkers reliaby correlating with the progression rate and disease severity. 
      Investigation of functional and structural alterations characterizing white (WM) 
      and gray matter (GM) in FRDA are needed prerequisite to monitor progression and 
      response to treatment. Here we report the results of a multimodal cross-sectional 
      MRI study of FRDA including Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM), diffusion-tensor 
      imaging (DTI), functional MRI (fMRI), and a correlation analysis with clinical 
      severity scores. Twenty-one early-onset FRDA patients and 18 age-matched healthy 
      controls (HCs) were imaged at 3T. All patients underwent a complete cognitive and 
      clinical assessment with ataxia scales. VBM analysis showed GM volume reduction 
      in FRDA compared to HCs bilaterally in lobules V, VI, VIII (L>R), as well as in 
      the crus of cerebellum, posterior lobe of the vermis, in the flocculi and in the 
      left tonsil. Voxel-wise DTI analysis showed a diffuse fractional anisotropy 
      reduction and mean, radial, axial (AD) diffusivity increase in both 
      infratentorial and supratentorial WM. ROI-based analysis confirmed the results 
      showing differences of the same DTI metrics in cortico-spinal-tracts, forceps 
      major, corpus callosum, posterior thalamic radiations, cerebellar penduncles. 
      Additionally, we observed increased AD in superior (SCP) and middle cerebellar 
      peduncles. The WM findings correlated with age at onset (AAO), short-allelle GAA, 
      and disease severity. The intragroup analysis of fMRI data from right-handed 14 
      FRDA and 15 HCs showed similar findings in both groups, including activation in 
      M1, insula and superior cerebellar hemisphere (lobules V-VIII). Significant 
      differences emerged only during the non-dominant hand movement, with HCs showing 
      a stronger activation in the left superior cerebellar hemisphere compared to 
      FRDA. Significant correlations were found between AAO and the fMRI activation in 
      cerebellar anterior and posterior lobes, insula and temporal lobe. Our multimodal 
      neuroimaging protocol suggests that MRI is a useful tool to document the 
      extension of the neurological impairment in FRDA.

TI  - Friedreich's Ataxia: Clinical Presentation of a Compound Heterozygote Child with

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with a GAA 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in intron 1 of the frataxin (FXN) gene. It is the 
      most common autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia, with a mean age of onset at 16 
      years. Nearly 95-98% of patients are homozygous for a 90-1300 GAA repeat 
      expansion with only 2-5% demonstrating compound heterozygosity. Compound 
      heterozygous individuals have a repeat expansion in one allele and a point 
      mutation/deletion/insertion in the other. Compound heterozygosity and point 
      mutations are very rare causes of Friedreich's ataxia and nonsense mutations are 
      a further rarity among point mutations. We report a rare compound heterozygous 
      Friedrich's ataxia patient who was found to have one expanded GAA FXN allele and 
      a nonsense point mutation in the other. We summarize the four previously 
      published cases of nonsense mutations and compare the phenotype to that of our 
      patient. We compared clinical information from our patient with other nonsense 
      FXN mutations reported in the literature. This nonsense mutation, to our 
      knowledge, has only been described once previously; interestingly the individual 
      was also of Cuban ancestry. A comparison with previously published cases of 
      nonsense mutations demonstrates some common clinical characteristics.

TI  - Nonataxia symptoms in Friedreich Ataxia: Report from the Registry of the European 
      Friedreich's Ataxia Consortium for Translational Studies (EFACTS).
PG  - e917-e930

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide a systematic evaluation of the broad clinical variability 
      in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), a multisystem disorder presenting mainly with 
      afferent ataxia but also a complex phenotype of nonataxia symptoms. METHODS: From 
      the large database of the European Friedreich's Ataxia Consortium for 
      Translational Studies, 650 patients with genetically confirmed FRDA were 
      included. Detailed data of medical history documentation, questionnaires, and 
      reports on clinical features were analyzed to provide in-depth description of the 
      clinical profile and frequency rates of phenotypical features with a focus on 
      differences between typical-onset and late-onset FRDA. Logistic regression 
      modeling was used to identify predictors for the presence of the most common 
      clinical features. RESULTS: The most frequent clinical features beyond afferent 
      ataxia were abnormal eye movements (90.5%), scoliosis (73.5%), deformities of the 
      feet (58.8%), urinary dysfunction (42.8%), cardiomyopathy and cardiac hypertrophy 
      (40.3%), followed by decreased visual acuity (36.8%); less frequent features 
      were, among others, depression (14.1%) and diabetes (7.1%). Most of these 
      features were more common in the typical-onset group compared to the late-onset 
      group. Logistic regression models for the presence of these symptoms demonstrated 
      the predictive value of GAA repeat length on the shorter allele and age at onset, 
      but also severity of ataxia signs, sex, and presence of neonatal problems. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This joint European effort demonstrates the multisystem nature of 
      this neurodegenerative disease encompassing most the central nervous, 
      neuromuscular, cardiologic, and sensory systems. A distinct and deeper knowledge 
      of this rare and chronic disease is highly relevant for clinical practice and 
      designs of clinical trials.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin (FXN). The genetic cause 
      of the disease is an expanded GAA repeat within the FXN gene. Agents that 
      increase expression of FXN protein are a potential approach to therapy. We 
      previously described anti-trinucleotide GAA duplex RNAs (dsRNAs) and antisense 
      oligonucleotides (ASOs) that activate FXN protein expression in multiple patient 
      derived cell lines. Here we test two distinct series of compounds for their 
      ability to increase FXN expression. ASOs with butane linkers showed low potency, 
      which is consistent with the low T(m) values and suggesting that flexible 
      conformation impairs activity. By contrast, single-stranded siRNAs (ss-siRNAs) 
      that combine the strengths of dsRNA and ASO approaches had nanomolar potencies. 
      ss-siRNAs provide an additional option for developing nucleic acid therapeutics 
      to treat FRDA.

AB  - Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder, 
      affecting dorsal root ganglia (DRG), cerebellar dentate nuclei and heart. It is 
      caused by a GAA repeat expansion mutation within the frataxin gene (FXN). This 
      impedes FXN transcription resulting in a progressive decrease of the 
      mitochondrial protein, frataxin. Increased oxidative stress leading to a chronic 
      depletion of endogenous antioxidants affects the survival of the cells and causes 
      neurodegeneration. In particular, cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) show a 
      significant increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and 
      lower level of reduced glutathione (GSH). In FRDA, one of the major pathways of 
      oxidant scavengers, the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, is defective. Previous studies 
      on FRDA-like CGNs showed that the reduced level of frataxin and the oxidative 
      stress induce mitochondrial impairments. By triggering the Nrf2 endogenous 
      pathway pharmacologically we determined whether this could promote mitochondrial 
      fitness and counteract oxidative stress. In this work, we sought to investigate 
      the beneficial effect of a promising Nrf2-inducer, omaveloxolone (omav), in CGNs 
      from two FRDA mouse models, KIKO and YG8R, and human fibroblasts from patients. 
      We found that CGNs from both KIKO and YG8R presented Complex I deficiency and 
      that omav was able to restore substrate availability and Complex I activity. This 
      was also confirmed in human primary fibroblasts from FRDA patients. Although 
      fibroblasts are not the major tissue affected, we found that they show 
      significant differences recapitulating the disease; this is therefore an 
      important tool to investigate patients' pathophysiology. Interestingly, we found 
      that patient fibroblasts had an increased level of endogenous lipid peroxidation 
      and mitochondrial ROS (mROS), and lower GSH at rest. Omav was able to reverse 
      this phenotype, protecting the cells against oxidative stress. By stimulating the 
      cells with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and looking for potential mitochondrial 
      pathophysiology, we found that fibroblasts could not maintain their mitochondrial 
      membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)). Remarkably, omav was protective to mitochondrial 
      depolarization, promoting mitochondrial respiration and preventing cell death. 
      Our results show that omav promotes Complex I activity and protect cells from 
      oxidative stress. Omav could, therefore, be used as a novel therapeutic drug to 
      ameliorate the pathophysiology of FRDA.

TI  - Genetic testing for clinically suspected spinocerebellar ataxias: report from a 
      tertiary referral centre in India.
PG  - 219-224
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative 
      syndromes, characterized by a wide range of muscular weakness and motor deficits, 
      caused due to cerebellar degeneration. The prevalence of the syndromes of SCA 
      varies across the world and is known to be linked to the instability of 
      trinucleotide repeats within the high-end normal alleles, along with susceptible 
      haplotype. We estimated sizes of the CAG or GAA repeat expansions at the SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA12 and frataxin loci among 864 referrals of subjects to genetic 
      counselling and testing (GCAT) clinic, National Institute of Mental Health and 
      Neurosciences, Bengaluru, India, with suspected SCA. The most frequent mutations 
      detected were SCA1 (n = 100 (11.6%)) and SCA2 (n = 98 (11.3%)) followed by SCA3 
      (n = 40 (4.6%)), FRDA (n = 20 (2.3%)) and SCA12 (n = 8 (0.9%)).

TI  - GAA*TTC repeat expansion in human cells is mediated by mismatch repair complex 
      MutLgamma and depends upon the endonuclease domain in MLH3 isoform one.
PG  - 4022-4032
LID - 10.1093/nar/gky143 [doi]
AB  - DNA repeat expansion underlies dozens of progressive neurodegenerative disorders. 
      While the mechanisms driving repeat expansion are not fully understood, 
      increasing evidence suggests a central role for DNA mismatch repair. The mismatch 
      repair recognition complex MutSbeta (MSH2-MSH3) that binds mismatched bases and/or 
      insertion/deletion loops has previously been implicated in GAA*TTC, CAG*CTG and 
      CGG*CCG repeat expansion, suggesting a shared mechanism. MutSbeta has been studied 
      in a number of models, but the contribution of subsequent steps mediated by the 
      MutL endonuclease in this pathway is less clear. Here we show that MutLgamma 
      (MLH1-MLH3) is the MutL complex responsible for GAA*TTC repeat expansion. 
      Lentiviral expression of shRNA targeting MutL nuclease components MLH1, PMS2, and 
      MLH3 revealed that reduced expression of MLH1 or MLH3 reduced the repeat 
      expansion rate in a human Friedreich ataxia cell model, while targeting PMS2 did 
      not. Using splice-switching oligonucleotides we show that MLH3 isoform 1 is 
      active in GAA*TTC repeat expansion while the nuclease-deficient MLH3 isoform 2 is 
      not. MLH3 isoform switching slowed repeat expansion in both model cells and FRDA 
      patient fibroblasts. Our work indicates a specific and active role for MutLgamma in 
      the expansion process and reveals plausible targets for disease-modifying 
      therapies.

LID - e0189990
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      transcriptional silencing of the frataxin gene (FXN) due to expansions of GAA 
      repeats in intron 1. FRDA manifests with multiple symptoms, which may include 
      ataxia, cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus. Expanded GAA tracts are genetically 
      unstable, exhibiting both expansions and contractions. GAA length correlates with 
      severity of FRDA symptoms and inversely with age of onset. Thus, tissue-specific 
      somatic instability of long GAA repeats may be implicated in the development of 
      symptoms and disease progression. Herein, we determined the extent of somatic 
      instability of the GAA repeats in heart, cerebral cortex, spinal cord, cerebellar 
      cortex, and pancreatic tissues from 15 FRDA patients. Results demonstrate 
      differences in the lengths of the expanded GAAs among different tissues, with 
      significantly longer GAA tracts detected in heart and pancreas than in other 
      tissues. The expansion bias detected in heart and pancreas may contribute to 
      disease onset and progression, making the mechanism of somatic instability an 
      important target for therapy. Additionally, we detected significant differences 
      in GAA tract lengths between lymphocytes and fibroblast pairs derived from 16 
      FRDA patients, with longer GAA tracts present in the lymphocytes. This result 
      urges caution in direct comparisons of data obtained in these frequently used 
      FRDA models. Furthermore, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of the GAA repeat 
      length in lymphocytes collected over a span of 7-9 years and demonstrated 
      progressive expansions of the GAAs with maximum gain of approximately 9 repeats 
      per year. Continuous GAA expansions throughout the patient's lifespan, as 
      observed in FRDA lymphocytes, should be considered in clinical trial designs and 
      data interpretation.

TI  - Comprehensive analysis of gene expression patterns in Friedreich's ataxia 
      fibroblasts by RNA sequencing reveals altered levels of protein synthesis factors 
      and solute carriers.
PG  - 1353-1369
LID - 10.1242/dmm.030536 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease 
      usually caused by large homozygous expansions of GAA repeat sequences in intron 1 
      of the frataxin (FXN) gene. FRDA patients homozygous for GAA expansions have low 
      FXN mRNA and protein levels when compared with heterozygous carriers or healthy 
      controls. Frataxin is a mitochondrial protein involved in iron-sulfur cluster 
      synthesis, and many FRDA phenotypes result from deficiencies in cellular 
      metabolism due to lowered expression of FXN Presently, there is no effective 
      treatment for FRDA, and biomarkers to measure therapeutic trial outcomes and/or 
      to gauge disease progression are lacking. Peripheral tissues, including blood 
      cells, buccal cells and skin fibroblasts, can readily be isolated from FRDA 
      patients and used to define molecular hallmarks of disease pathogenesis. For 
      instance, FXN mRNA and protein levels as well as FXN GAA-repeat tract lengths are 
      routinely determined using all of these cell types. However, because these 
      tissues are not directly involved in disease pathogenesis, their relevance as 
      models of the molecular aspects of the disease is yet to be decided. Herein, we 
      conducted unbiased RNA sequencing to profile the transcriptomes of fibroblast 
      cell lines derived from 18 FRDA patients and 17 unaffected control individuals. 
      Bioinformatic analyses revealed significantly upregulated expression of genes 
      encoding plasma membrane solute carrier proteins in FRDA fibroblasts. Conversely, 
      the expression of genes encoding accessory factors and enzymes involved in 
      cytoplasmic and mitochondrial protein synthesis was consistently decreased in 
      FRDA fibroblasts. Finally, comparison of genes differentially expressed in FRDA 
      fibroblasts to three previously published gene expression signatures defined for 
      FRDA blood cells showed substantial overlap between the independent datasets, 
      including correspondingly deficient expression of antioxidant defense genes. 
      Together, these results indicate that gene expression profiling of cells derived 
      from peripheral tissues can, in fact, consistently reveal novel molecular 
      pathways of the disease. When performed on statistically meaningful sample group 
      sizes, unbiased global profiling analyses utilizing peripheral tissues are 
      critical for the discovery and validation of FRDA disease biomarkers.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an incurable autosomal recessive neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin due to 
      an intronic GAA-repeat expansion in the FXN gene. We report the therapeutic 
      efficacy of transplanting wild-type mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells 
      (HSPCs) into the YG8R mouse model of FRDA. In the HSPC-transplanted YG8R mice, 
      development of muscle weakness and locomotor deficits was abrogated as was 
      degeneration of large sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and 
      mitochondrial capacity was improved in brain, skeletal muscle, and heart. 
      Transplanted HSPCs engrafted and then differentiated into microglia in the brain 
      and spinal cord and into macrophages in the DRGs, heart, and muscle of YG8R FRDA 
      mice. We observed the transfer of wild-type frataxin and Cox8 mitochondrial 
      proteins from HSPC-derived microglia/macrophages to FRDA mouse neurons and muscle 
      myocytes in vivo. Our results show the HSPC-mediated phenotypic rescue of FRDA in 
      YG8R mice and suggest that this approach should be investigated further as a 
      strategy for treating FRDA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Friedreich ataxia (FA) is a progressive neuromuscular disorder caused 
      by GAA triplet repeat expansions or point mutations in the FXN gene. FA is 
      associated with increased risk of diabetes mellitus (DM). This study assessed the 
      age-specific prevalence of FA-associated DM and its impact on neurologic 
      outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were 811 individuals with FA 
      from 12 international sites in a prospective natural history study (FA Clinical 
      Outcome Measures Study, FACOMS). Physical function was assessed, using validated 
      instruments. Multivariable regression analyses examined the independent 
      association of DM with outcomes. RESULTS: Mean age of participants was 30.1 years 
      (SD 15.3, range: 7-82), 50% were female, and 94% were non-Hispanic white. 9% 
      (42/459) of adults and 3% (10/352) of children had DM. Individuals with 
      FA-associated DM were older (P < 0.001), had longer GAA repeat length on the 
      least affected FXN allele (P = 0.037), and more severe FA (P = 0.0001). Of 
      individuals with DM, 65% (34/52) were taking insulin. Even after accounting 
      statistically for both age and GAA repeat length, DM was independently associated 
      with greater FA symptom burden (P = 0.010), reduced capacity to perform 
      activities of daily living (P = 0.021), and a decrease of 0.33 SDs on a composite 
      performance measure (95% CI: -0.56-0.11, P = 0.004); the relative impact of DM 
      was most apparent in younger individuals. CONCLUSIONS: DM-associated FA has an 
      independent adverse impact on well-being in affected individuals, particularly at 
      younger ages. In future, evidence-based approaches for identification and 
      management of FA-related DM may improve both health and function.

TI  - Selected missense mutations impair frataxin processing in Friedreich ataxia.
PG  - 575-584
LID - 10.1002/acn3.433 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Frataxin (FXN) is a highly conserved mitochondrial protein. Reduced 
      FXN levels cause Friedreich ataxia, a recessive neurodegenerative disease. 
      Typical patients carry GAA repeat expansions on both alleles, while a subgroup of 
      patients carry a missense mutation on one allele and a GAA repeat expansion on 
      the other. Here, we report that selected disease-related FXN missense mutations 
      impair FXN localization, interaction with mitochondria processing peptidase, and 
      processing. METHODS: Immunocytochemical studies and subcellular fractionation 
      were performed to study FXN import into the mitochondria and examine the 
      mechanism by which mutations impair FXN processing. Coimmunoprecipitation was 
      performed to study the interaction between FXN and mitochondrial processing 
      peptidase. A proteasome inhibitor was used to model traditional therapeutic 
      strategies. In addition, clinical profiles of subjects with and without point 
      mutations were compared in a large natural history study. RESULTS: FXN(I)(154F) 
      and FXN(G)(130V) missense mutations decrease FXN (81-210) levels compared with 
      FXN(WT), FXN(R)(165C), and FXN(W)(155R), but do not block its association with 
      mitochondria. FXN(I)(154F) and FXN(G)(130V) also impair FXN maturation and 
      enhance the binding between FXN (42-210) and mitochondria processing peptidase. 
      Furthermore, blocking proteosomal degradation does not increase FXN (81-210) 
      levels. Additionally, impaired FXN processing also occurs in fibroblasts from 
      patients with FXN(G)(130V). Finally, clinical data from patients with 
      FXN(G)(130V) and FXN(I)(154F) mutations demonstrates a lower severity compared 
      with other individuals with Friedreich ataxia. INTERPRETATION: These data suggest 
      that the effects on processing associated with FXN(G)(130V) and FXN(I)(154F) 
      mutations lead to higher levels of partially processed FXN, which may contribute 
      to the milder clinical phenotypes in these patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: DNA extraction prior to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification 
      in genetic diagnoses of triplet repeat disorders (TRDs) is tedious and 
      labour-intensive and has the limitations of sample contamination with foreign 
      DNA, including that from preceding samples. Therefore, we aimed to develop a 
      rapid, robust, and cost-effective method for expeditious genetic investigation of 
      TRDs from whole blood as a DNA template. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were 
      collected from 70 clinically suspected patients of progressive ataxia. The 
      conventional method using genomic DNA and single-step Blood-Direct PCR (BD-PCR) 
      method with just 2mul of whole blood sample were tested to amplify triplet repeat 
      expansion in genes related to spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 12 and 
      Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). Post-PCR, the allele sizes were mapped and repeat 
      numbers were calculated using GeneMapper and macros run in Microsoft Excel 
      programmes. RESULTS: Successful amplification of target regions was achieved in 
      all samples by both methods. The frequency of the normal and mutated allele was 
      concordant between both methods, diagnosing 37% positive for a mutation in either 
      of the candidate genes. The BD-PCR resulted in higher intensities of product 
      peaks of normal and pathogenic alleles. CONCLUSIONS: The nearly-accurate sizing 
      of the normal and expanded allele was achieved in a shorter time (4-5h), without 
      DNA extraction and any risk of cross contamination, which suggests the BD-PCR to 
      be a reliable, inexpensive, and rapid method to confirm TRDs. This technique can 
      be introduced in routine diagnostic procedures of other tandem repeat disorders.

TI  - Comparison of Two Different PCR-based Methods for Detection of GAA Expansions in 
      Frataxin Gene.
PG  - 222-228
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expansion of GAA trinucleotide repeats is the molecular basis of 
      Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). Precise detection of the GAA expansion repeat in 
      frataxin gene has always been a challenge. Different molecular methods have been 
      suggested for detection of GAA expansion, including; short-PCR, long-PCR, Triplet 
      repeat primed-PCR (TP-PCR) and southern blotting. The aim of study was to 
      evaluate two PCR-based methods, TP-PCR and long-PCR, and to explore the use of 
      TP-PCR accompanying with long-PCR for accurate genotyping of FRDA patients. 
      METHODS: Blood samples were collected from six Iranian patients suspected to 
      FRDA, who referred to the Department of Medical Genetics at Tehran University of 
      Medical Sciences during the year 2014. For one of these patients' four 
      asymptomatic members of the family were also recruited for the analysis. DNA 
      extraction was performed by two different methods. TP-PCR and long-PCR were 
      carried out in all samples. The type of this study is assessment / investigation 
      of methods. RESULTS: Using a combination of the above methods, the genotypes of 
      all samples were confirmed as five homozygous mutants (expanded GAA repeats), two 
      heterozygous and three homozygous normal (normal repeat size). The results 
      obtained by TP-PCR are consistent with long-PCR results. CONCLUSION: The presence 
      or absence of expanded alleles can be identified correctly by TP-PCR. Performing 
      long-PCR and Fluorescent-long-PCR enables accurate genotyping in all samples. 
      This approach is highly reliable. It could be successfully used for detection of 
      GAA expansion repeats.

TI  - Early-Onset Friedreich's Ataxia With Oculomotor Apraxia.
PG  - 128-130
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a rare autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia 
      which in the majority of cases is associated with a GAA-trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in the first intron of Frataxin gene located on chromosome 9. The 
      clinical features include progressive gait and limb ataxia, cerebellar 
      dysarthria, neuropathy, optic atrophy, and loss of vibration and proprioception. 
      Ataxia with ocular motor apraxia type 1 (AOA1) is another autosomal recessive 
      cerebellar ataxia which is associated with oculomotor apraxia, hypoalbuminaemia, 
      and hypercholesterolemia. Here we describe two siblings (13- and 10-year-old) 
      display overlapping clinical features of both early-onset FRDA and AOA1. Almost 
      all of laboratory test (including urinary analysis/culture, biochemistry, 
      peripheral blood smear, C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation 
      rate-1h) results were within the normal range for both patients. Due to the 
      normal laboratory test results; we concluded that the diagnosis was more likely 
      to be FRDA than AOA1. Therefore, neurologists should bear in mind that clinical 
      presentations of FRDA may vary widely from the classical phenotype of gait and 
      limb ataxia to atypical manifestations such as oculomotor apraxia.

AB  - Friedreich Ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder 
      most commonly caused by guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions in both alleles of the FXN gene. Although progressive ataxia remains 
      the hallmark clinical feature, patients with FRDA are at high risk of developing 
      cardiomyopathy, often resulting in premature death. There is no specific 
      treatment for FRDA-associated cardiomyopathy; even in advanced cardiac failure 
      cardiac transplantation is not commonly pursued. This case series describes 
      extended follow-up of three FRDA cases with end-stage heart failure but mild 
      neurologic disease who underwent successful heart transplantation. We also review 
      and examine the ethical considerations for heart transplantation in the setting 
      of neurodegenerative disease.

TI  - Lentivirus-meditated frataxin gene delivery reverses genome instability in 
      Friedreich ataxia patient and mouse model fibroblasts.
PG  - 846-856
LID - 10.1038/gt.2016.61 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by 
      deficiency of frataxin protein, with the primary sites of pathology being the 
      large sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia and the cerebellum. FRDA is also 
      often accompanied by severe cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus. Frataxin is 
      important in mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis and low-frataxin 
      expression is due to a GAA repeat expansion in intron 1 of the FXN gene. FRDA 
      cells are genomically unstable, with increased levels of reactive oxygen species 
      and sensitivity to oxidative stress. Here we report the identification of 
      elevated levels of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in FRDA patient and YG8sR FRDA 
      mouse model fibroblasts compared to normal fibroblasts. Using lentivirus FXN gene 
      delivery to FRDA patient and YG8sR cells, we obtained long-term overexpression of 
      FXN mRNA and frataxin protein levels with reduced DSB levels towards normal. 
      Furthermore, gamma-irradiation of FRDA patient and YG8sR cells revealed impaired DSB 
      repair that was recovered on FXN gene transfer. This suggests that frataxin may 
      be involved in DSB repair, either directly by an unknown mechanism, or indirectly 
      via ISC biogenesis for DNA repair enzymes, which may be essential for the 
      prevention of neurodegeneration.

AB  - Here, we describe the clinical features of several members of the same family 
      diagnosed with Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) and cerebral lesions, demyelinating 
      neuropathy, and late-age onset without a significant cardiac involvement and 
      presenting with similar symptoms, although genetic testing was negative for the 
      GAA repeat expansion in one patient of the family. The GAA repeat expansion in 
      the frataxin gene was shown in all of the family members except in a young female 
      patient. MRI revealed arachnoid cysts in two patients; MRI was consistent with 
      both cavum septum pellucidum-cavum vergae and nodular signal intensity increase 
      in one patient. EMG showed demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy in another 
      patient. The GAA expansion-negative 11-year-old female patient had mental-motor 
      retardation, epilepsy, and ataxia. None of the patients had significant cardiac 
      symptoms. Description of FRDA families with different ethnic backgrounds may 
      assist in identifying possible phenotypic and genetic features of the disease. 
      Furthermore, the genetic heterogeneity observed in this family draws attention to 
      the difficulty of genetic counseling in an inbred population and to the need for 
      genotyping all affected members before delivering comprehensive genetic 
      counseling.

TI  - Progression of Friedreich ataxia: quantitative characterization over 5 years.
PG  - 684-94
LID - 10.1002/acn3.332 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder 
      of adults and children. This study analyzed neurological outcomes and changes to 
      identify predictors of progression and generate power calculations for clinical 
      trials. METHODS: Eight hundred and twelve subjects in a natural history study 
      were evaluated annually across 12 sites using the Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale 
      (FARS), 9-Hole Peg Test, Timed 25-Foot Walk, visual acuity tests, self-reported 
      surveys and disability scales. Cross-sectional outcomes were assessed from recent 
      visits, and longitudinal changes were gaged over 5 years from baseline. RESULTS: 
      Cross-sectional outcomes correlated with measures of disease severity. Age, 
      genetic severity (guanine-adenine-adenine [GAA] repeat length), and testing site 
      predicted performance. Serial progression was relatively linear using FARS and 
      composite measures of performance, while individual performance outcomes were 
      nonlinear over time. Age strongly predicted change from baseline until removing 
      the effects of baseline FARS scores, when GAA becomes a more important factor. 
      Progression is fastest in younger subjects and subjects with longer GAA repeats. 
      Improved coefficients of variation show that progression results are more 
      reproducible over longer assessment durations. INTERPRETATION: While age 
      predicted progression speed in simple analyses and may provide an effective way 
      to stratify cohorts, separating the effects of age and genetic severity is 
      difficult. Controlling for baseline severity, GAA is the major determinant of 
      progression rate in FRDA. Clinical trials will benefit from enrollment of younger 
      subjects, and sample size requirements will shrink with longer assessment 
      periods. These findings should prove useful in devising gene therapy trials in 
      the near future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCA) are a group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders characterized by early onset of gait impairment, 
      disturbed limb coordination, dysarthria, and eye movement abnormalities, most 
      likely due to the degeneration of cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. Despite 
      of the rarity, ARCA are both clinically and genetically heterogeneous. To date, 
      more than 30 culprit genes have been identified in ARCA. Unraveling the specific 
      causative mutation in cases with ARCA remains challenging so far. METHODS: Three 
      ARCA pedigrees of Chinese ancestry were recruited. Clinical features were 
      evaluated and peripheral blood was collected after obtaining the written inform. 
      Laboratory examinations, brain MRI, and EMG were performed for all the affected 
      individuals. Genomic DNA was extracted, followed by the screening of GAA repeat 
      expansion in FXN gene to exclude Friedreich's ataxia. Targeted next-generation 
      sequencing combining Sanger sequencing was performed in each proband of these 
      families. RESULTS: Compound heterozygous mutations, c.3190G > T (p.E1064X) and 
      c.4883C > G (p.S1628X) of senataxin (SETX) gene were identified in one family 
      with two affected cases. Both of the patients presented with early onset of 
      unsteady walk, dysarthria, and diplopia. EMG test revealed decreased conduction 
      velocity and evoked potential of both motor and sensory nerve. Moreover, elevated 
      serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and apparent cerebellar atrophy were observed. 
      These features were typical features of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 
      (AOA2) and in line with the genetic results. However, no specific mutation was 
      identified in the other two pedigrees. CONCLUSIONS: We identified novel compound 
      heterozygous mutations of SETX in Chinese AOA2 pedigree, which broaden the 
      mutation spectrum of SETX. To our knowledge, this is the first report concerning 
      Chinese AOA2 cases with SETX mutations.

TI  - Cerebral and cerebellar grey matter atrophy in Friedreich ataxia: the IMAGE-FRDA 
      study.
PG  - 2215-2223
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is traditionally associated with neuropathology in the 
      cerebellar dentate nucleus and spinal cord. Growing evidence also suggests 
      involvement of the cerebral and cerebellar cortices, although reports of 
      structural abnormalities remain mixed. This study assessed the structural 
      integrity of cortical grey matter in FRDA, focussing on regions in which 
      pathology may underlie the motor deficits characteristic of this disorder. 
      T1-weighted anatomical magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired from 31 
      individuals with FRDA and 37 healthy controls. Cortical thickness (FreeSurfer) 
      and cortical volume (SPM-VBM) were measured in cerebral motor regions-of-interest 
      (primary motor, dorsal and ventral premotor, and supplementary motor areas) 
      alongside unconstrained exploratory analyses of the cerebral and cerebellar 
      cortices. Correlations were assessed between cortical thickness/volume measures 
      and each of disease severity, length of the causative genetic triplet-repeat 
      expansion, and finger-tapping behavioural measures. Individuals with FRDA had 
      significantly reduced cortical thickness, relative to controls, in the premotor 
      and supplementary motor areas. Reduced cortical thickness and/or volume were also 
      observed in the cuneus and precuneus, posterior aspects of the medial and lateral 
      prefrontal cortices, insula, temporal poles, and cerebellar lobules V, VI, and 
      VII. Measures of clinical severity, genetic abnormality, and motor dysfunction 
      correlated with volume loss in the lateral cerebellar hemispheres. These results 
      suggest that atrophy preferentially affects premotor relative to primary areas of 
      the cortical motor system, and also extends to a range of non-motor brain 
      regions. Furthermore, cortical thickness and cortical volume findings were 
      largely divergent, suggesting that each is sensitive to different aspects of 
      neuropathology in FRDA. Overall, this study supports a disease model involving 
      neural aberrations within the cerebral and cerebellar cortices, beyond those 
      traditionally associated with this disorder.

TI  - Stalled DNA Replication Forks at the Endogenous GAA Repeats Drive Repeat 
      Expansion in Friedreich's Ataxia Cells.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is caused by the expansion of GAA repeats located in 
      the Frataxin (FXN) gene. The GAA repeats continue to expand in FRDA patients, 
      aggravating symptoms and contributing to disease progression. The mechanism 
      leading to repeat expansion and decreased FXN transcription remains unclear. 
      Using single-molecule analysis of replicated DNA, we detected that expanded GAA 
      repeats present a substantial obstacle for the replication machinery at the FXN 
      locus in FRDA cells. Furthermore, aberrant origin activation and lack of a proper 
      stress response to rescue the stalled forks in FRDA cells cause an increase in 
      3'-5' progressing forks, which could enhance repeat expansion and hinder FXN 
      transcription by head-on collision with RNA polymerases. Treatment of FRDA cells 
      with GAA-specific polyamides rescues DNA replication fork stalling and alleviates 
      expansion of the GAA repeats, implicating DNA triplexes as a replication 
      impediment and suggesting that fork stalling might be a therapeutic target for 
      FRDA.

TI  - Deep sequencing of mitochondrial genomes reveals increased mutation load in 
      Friedreich's ataxia.
PG  - 523-36
LID - 10.1002/acn3.322 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion disorder caused by epigenetic silencing of the frataxin gene 
      (FXN). Current research suggests that damage and variation of mitochondrial DNA 
      (mtDNA) contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of FRDA. We sought to establish 
      the extent of the mutation burden across the mitochondrial genome in FRDA cells 
      and investigate the molecular mechanisms connecting FXN downregulation and the 
      acquisition of mtDNA damage. METHODS: Damage and mutation load in mtDNA of a 
      panel of FRDA and control fibroblasts were determined using qPCR and 
      next-generation MiSeq sequencing, respectively. The capacity of FRDA and control 
      cells to repair oxidative lesions in their mtDNA was measured using a 
      quantitative DNA damage assay. Comprehensive RNA sequencing gene expression 
      analyses were conducted to assess the status of DNA repair and metabolism genes 
      in FRDA cells. RESULTS: Acute or prolonged downregulation of FXN expression 
      resulted in a significant increase in mtDNA damage that translated to a 
      significant elevation of mutation load in mtDNA. The predominant mutations 
      identified throughout the mtDNA were C>T, G>A transitions (P = 0.007). Low FXN 
      expression reduced capacity to repair oxidative damage in mtDNA. Downregulation 
      of FXN expression strongly correlated (r = 0.73) with decreased levels of base 
      excision repair (BER) DNA glycosylase NTHL1. INTERPRETATION: Downregulation of 
      FXN expression in FRDA cells elevates mtDNA damage, increases mutation load of 
      the mitochondrial genome, and diminishes DNA repair capacity. Progressive 
      accumulation of mtDNA mutations in vulnerable FRDA patient cells reduces 
      mitochondrial fitness ultimately leading to cell death.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease. The 
      mutation consists of a GAA repeat expansion within the FXN gene, which 
      downregulates frataxin, leading to abnormal mitochondrial iron accumulation, 
      which may in turn cause changes in mitochondrial function. Although, many studies 
      of FRDA patients and mouse models have been conducted in the past two decades, 
      the role of frataxin in mitochondrial pathophysiology remains elusive. Are the 
      mitochondrial abnormalities only a side effect of the increased accumulation of 
      reactive iron, generating oxidative stress? Or does the progressive lack of 
      iron-sulphur clusters (ISCs), induced by reduced frataxin, cause an inhibition of 
      the electron transport chain complexes (CI, II and III) leading to reactive 
      oxygen species escaping from oxidative phosphorylation reactions? To answer these 
      crucial questions, we have characterised the mitochondrial pathophysiology of a 
      group of disease-relevant and readily accessible neurons, cerebellar granule 
      cells, from a validated FRDA mouse model. By using live cell imaging and 
      biochemical techniques we were able to demonstrate that mitochondria are 
      deregulated in neurons from the YG8R FRDA mouse model, causing a decrease in 
      mitochondrial membrane potential (triangle upPsim) due to an inhibition of Complex I, which 
      is partially compensated by an overactivation of Complex II. This complex 
      activity imbalance leads to ROS generation in both mitochondrial matrix and 
      cytosol, which results in glutathione depletion and increased lipid peroxidation. 
      Preventing this increase in lipid peroxidation, in neurons, protects against in 
      cell death. This work describes the pathophysiological properties of the 
      mitochondria in neurons from a FRDA mouse model and shows that lipid peroxidation 
      could be an important target for novel therapeutic strategies in FRDA, which 
      still lacks a cure.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is one of the most devastating childhood onset 
      neurodegenerative disease affecting multiple organs in the course of progression. 
      FRDA is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction due to deficit in a nuclear 
      encoded mitochondrial protein, frataxin. Identification of disease-specific 
      biomarker for monitoring the severity remains to be a challenging topic. This 
      study was aimed to identify whether circulating cell-free nuclear DNA (nDNA) and 
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in blood plasma can be a potential biomarker for FRDA. 
      Clinical information was assessed using International Cooperative Ataxia Rating 
      Scale and the disease was confirmed using Long-range PCR for GAA repeat expansion 
      within the gene encoding frataxin. The frataxin expression was measured using 
      Western blot. Plasma nDNA and mtDNA levels were quantified by Multiplex real-time 
      PCR. The major observation is that the levels of nDNA found to be increased, 
      whereas mtDNA levels were reduced significantly in the plasma of FRDA patients 
      (n=21) as compared to healthy controls (n=21). Further, plasma mtDNA levels 
      showed high sensitivity (90%) and specificity (76%) in distinguishing from 
      healthy controls with optimal cutoff indicated at 4.1x10(5)GE/mL. Interestingly, 
      a small group of follow-up patients (n=9) on intervention with, a nutrient 
      supplement, omega-3 fatty acid (a known enhancer of mitochondrial metabolism) 
      displayed a significant improvement in the levels of plasma mtDNA, supporting our 
      hypothesis that plasma mtDNA can be a potential monitoring or prognosis biomarker 
      for FRDA.

      inflammation.
PG  - 46

LID - 46
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are highly vulnerable to frataxin 
      deficiency in Friedreich ataxia (FA), an autosomal recessive disease due to 
      pathogenic homozygous guanine-adenine-adenine trinucleotide repeat expansions in 
      intron 1 of the FXN gene (chromosome 9q21.11). An immunohistochemical and 
      immunofluorescence study of DRG in 15 FA cases and 12 controls revealed that FA 
      causes major primary changes in satellite cells and inflammatory destruction of 
      neurons. A panel of antibodies was used to reveal the cytoplasm of satellite 
      cells (glutamine synthetase, S100, metabotropic glutamate receptors 2/3, 
      excitatory amino acid transporter 1, ATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium 
      channel 10, and cytosolic ferritin), gap junctions (connexin 43), basement 
      membranes (laminin), mitochondria (ATP synthase subunit beta and frataxin), and 
      monocytes (CD68 and IBA1). RESULTS: Reaction product of the cytoplasmic markers 
      and laminin confirmed proliferation of satellite cells and processes into 
      multiple perineuronal layers and residual nodules. The formation of connexin 
      43-reactive gap junctions between satellite cells was strongly upregulated. 
      Proliferating satellite cells in FA displayed many more frataxin- and 
      ATP5B-reactive mitochondria than normal. Monocytes entered into the satellite 
      cell layer, appeared to penetrate neuronal plasma membranes, and infiltrated 
      residual nodules. Satellite cells and IBA1-reactive monocytes displayed 
      upregulated ferritin biosynthesis, which was most likely due to leakage of iron 
      from dying neurons. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that FA differentially affects the 
      key cellular elements of DRG, and postulate that the disease causes loss of 
      bidirectional trophic support between satellite cells and neurons.

TI  - Friedreich ataxia is not only a GAA repeats expansion disorder: implications for 
      molecular testing and counselling.
PG  - 349-55
LID - 10.1007/s13353-015-0331-4 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is the most common hereditary ataxia. It is an autosomal 
      recessive disorder caused by mutations of the FXN gene, mainly the biallelic 
      expansion of the (GAA)n repeats in its first intron. Heterozygous expansion/point 
      mutations or deletions are rare; no patients with two point mutations or a point 
      mutation/deletion have been described, suggesting that loss of the FXN gene 
      product, frataxin, is lethal. This is why routine FRDA molecular diagnostics is 
      focused on (GAA)n expansion analysis. Additional tests are considered only in 
      cases of heterozygous expansion carriers and an atypical clinical picture. 
      Analyses of the parent's carrier status, together with diagnostic tests, are 
      performed in rare cases, and, because of that, we may underestimate the frequency 
      of deletions. Even though FXN deletions are characterised as 'exquisitely rare,' 
      we were able to identify one case (2.4 %) of a (GAA)n expansion/exonic deletion 
      in a group of 41 probands. This was a patient with very early onset of disease 
      with rapid progression of gait instability and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We 
      compared the patient's clinical data to expansion/deletion carriers available in 
      the literature and suggest that, in clinical practice, the FXN deletion test 
      should be taken into account in patients with early-onset, rapid progressive 
      ataxia and severe scoliosis.

TI  - Reversal of epigenetic promoter silencing in Friedreich ataxia by a class I 
      histone deacetylase inhibitor.
PG  - 5095-104
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkw107 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia, the most prevalent inherited ataxia, is caused by an expanded 
      GAA triplet-repeat sequence in intron 1 of the FXN gene. Repressive chromatin 
      spreads from the expanded GAA triplet-repeat sequence to cause epigenetic 
      silencing of the FXN promoter via altered nucleosomal positioning and reduced 
      chromatin accessibility. Indeed, deficient transcriptional initiation is the 
      predominant cause of transcriptional deficiency in Friedreich ataxia. Treatment 
      with 109, a class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, resulted in increased 
      level of FXN transcript both upstream and downstream of the expanded GAA 
      triplet-repeat sequence, without any change in transcript stability, suggesting 
      that it acts via improvement of transcriptional initiation. Quantitative analysis 
      of transcriptional initiation via metabolic labeling of nascent transcripts in 
      patient-derived cells revealed a >3-fold increase (P < 0.05) in FXN promoter 
      function. A concomitant 3-fold improvement (P < 0.001) in FXN promoter structure 
      and chromatin accessibility was observed via Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome 
      Sequencing, a high-resolution in vivo footprint assay for detecting nucleosome 
      occupancy in individual chromatin fibers. No such improvement in FXN promoter 
      function or structure was observed upon treatment with a chemically-related 
      inactive compound (966). Thus epigenetic promoter silencing in Friedreich ataxia 
      is reversible, and the results implicate class I HDACs in repeat-mediated 
      promoter silencing.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of a GAA.TTC triplet in the first 
      intron of the FXN gene, encoding the essential mitochondrial protein frataxin. 
      Repeat expansion results in transcriptional silencing through an epigenetic 
      mechanism, resulting in significant decreases in frataxin protein in affected 
      individuals. Since the FXN protein coding sequence is unchanged in FRDA, an 
      attractive therapeutic approach for this disease would be to increase 
      transcription of pathogenic alleles with small molecules that target the 
      silencing mechanism. AREAS COVERED: We review the evidence that histone 
      postsynthetic modifications and heterochromatin formation are responsible for FXN 
      gene silencing in FRDA, along with efforts to reverse silencing with drugs that 
      target histone modifying enzymes. Chemical and pharmacological properties of 
      histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, which reverse silencing, together with 
      enzyme target profiles and kinetics of inhibition, are discussed. Two HDAC 
      inhibitors have been studied in human clinical trials and the properties of these 
      compounds are compared and contrasted. Efforts to improve on bioavailability, 
      metabolic stability, and target activity are reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: 
      2-aminobenzamide class I HDAC inhibitors are attractive therapeutic small 
      molecules for FRDA. These molecules increase FXN gene expression in human 
      neuronal cells derived from patient induced pluripotent stem cells, and in two 
      mouse models for the disease, as well as in circulating lymphocytes in patients 
      treated in a phase Ib clinical trial. Medicinal chemistry efforts have identified 
      compounds with improved brain penetration, metabolic stability and efficacy in 
      the human neuronal cell model. A clinical candidate will soon be identified for 
      further human testing.

TI  - Compound heterozygous FXN mutations and clinical outcome in friedreich ataxia.
PG  - 485-95
LID - 10.1002/ana.24595 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized by ataxia and cardiomyopathy. Homozygous GAA trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions in the first intron of FXN occur in 96% of affected individuals and 
      reduce frataxin expression. Remaining individuals are compound heterozygous for a 
      GAA expansion and a FXN point/insertion/deletion mutation. We examined 
      disease-causing mutations and the impact on frataxin structure/function and 
      clinical outcome in FRDA. METHODS: We compared clinical information from 111 
      compound heterozygotes and 131 individuals with homozygous expansions. Frataxin 
      mutations were examined using structural modeling, stability analyses and 
      systematic literature review, and categorized into four groups: (1) homozygous 
      expansions, and three compound heterozygote groups; (2) null (no frataxin 
      produced); (3) moderate/strong impact; and (4) minimal impact. Mean age of onset 
      and the presence of cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus were compared using 
      regression analyses. RESULTS: Mutations in the hydrophobic core of frataxin 
      affected stability whereas surface residue mutations affected interactions with 
      iron sulfur cluster assembly and heme biosynthetic proteins. The null group of 
      compound heterozygotes had significantly earlier age of onset and increased 
      diabetes mellitus, compared to the homozygous expansion group. There were no 
      significant differences in mean age of onset between homozygotes and the minimal 
      and moderate/strong impact groups. INTERPRETATION: In compound heterozygotes, 
      expression of partially functional mutant frataxin delays age of onset and 
      reduces diabetes mellitus, compared to those with no frataxin expression from the 
      non-expanded allele. This integrated analysis of categorized frataxin mutations 
      and their correlation with clinical outcome provide a definitive resource for 
      investigating disease pathogenesis in FRDA.

TI  - A 22-Year Follow-up Study of Long-term Cardiac Outcome and Predictors of Survival 
      in Friedreich Ataxia.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is the most common genetic sensory ataxia, 
      and myocardial involvement is a major determinant of survival. OBJECTIVE: To 
      assess FRDA survival and cardiac outcome to adapt future therapeutic trials. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a longitudinal follow-up study, all 
      patients with genetically confirmed FRDA seen in the reference center and 
      referred for cardiac evaluation (standard 12-lead electrocardiogram and 
      transthoracic echocardiography) to the cardiology department were enrolled and 
      followed up from April 27, 1990, to July 31, 2013. The setting was the French 
      National Reference Center for Rare Diseases and the Department of Cardiology, 
      Salpetriere University Hospital, Paris, France. In total, 138 patients with FRDA 
      were followed up. Among 133 patients homozygous for expanded GAA repeats, the 
      mean (SD) age was 31 (10) years (age range, 11-62 years), with a mean (SD) age at 
      disease onset of 16 (8) years (age range, 3-50 years) and a mean (SD) age at 
      first wheelchair use of 26 (9) years (age range, 11-64 years). Cardiac 
      hypertrophy was present in 57.9% (77 of 133), and electrocardiography was normal 
      in 6.8% (9 of 133). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Long-term cardiac outcome and 
      predictors of survival in FRDA. RESULTS: After a mean (SD) follow-up of 10.5 
      (5.5) years (range, 0.6-23.0 years), the 10-year survival rate was 88.5%. In 
      80.0% of patients (12 of 15), death was due to cardiac causes. Predictors of 
      survival were a shorter GAA repeat length on the smaller allele of the frataxin 
      gene (hazard ratio [HR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.28-2.69), left ventricular ejection 
      fraction (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20-0.89), and left ventricular mass index (HR, 
      1.19; 95% CI, 1.04-1.36). Two cardiac evolutions were distinguished with a 
      group-based trajectory model, including a low-risk cardiac group (78.6% [81 of 
      103] with normal ejection fraction at baseline that declined slightly over time 
      but remained within the normal range) and a high-risk cardiac group (21.4% [22 of 
      103] in which the ejection fraction progressively declined during follow-up). The 
      patients with the worse cardiac evolution had longer GAA repeats. Neurological 
      impairment was not predictive of cardiac change over time. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: Survival in FRDA is determined by cardiac complications, which are 
      dependent on the mutation (ie, the size of the expanded GAA repeat). Patients 
      with progressive decline of the left ventricular ejection fraction had a worse 
      prognosis. This finding demonstrates that cardiac follow-up is important in FRDA 
      to identify individuals at risk for further cardiac complications.

TI  - Expanded GAA repeats impede transcription elongation through the FXN gene and 
      induce transcriptional silencing that is restricted to the FXN locus.
PG  - 6932-43
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddv397 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a severe neurodegenerative disease caused by 
      homozygous expansion of the guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) repeats in intron 1 of 
      the FXN gene leading to transcriptional repression of frataxin expression. 
      Post-translational histone modifications that typify heterochromatin are enriched 
      in the vicinity of the repeats, whereas active chromatin marks in this region are 
      underrepresented in FRDA samples. Yet, the immediate effect of the expanded 
      repeats on transcription progression through FXN and their long-range effect on 
      the surrounding genomic context are two critical questions that remain unanswered 
      in the molecular pathogenesis of FRDA. To address these questions, we conducted 
      next-generation RNA sequencing of a large cohort of FRDA and control primary 
      fibroblasts. This comprehensive analysis revealed that the GAA-induced silencing 
      effect does not influence expression of neighboring genes upstream or downstream 
      of FXN. Furthermore, no long-range silencing effects were detected across a large 
      portion of chromosome 9. Additionally, results of chromatin immunoprecipitation 
      studies confirmed that histone modifications associated with repressed 
      transcription are confined to the FXN locus. Finally, deep sequencing of FXN 
      pre-mRNA molecules revealed a pronounced defect in the transcription elongation 
      rate in FRDA cells when compared with controls. These results indicate that 
      approaches aimed to reactivate frataxin expression should simultaneously address 
      deficits in transcription initiation and elongation at the FXN locus.

TI  - FXN Promoter Silencing in the Humanized Mouse Model of Friedreich Ataxia.
PG  - e0138437
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0138437 [doi]
LID - e0138437
AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich ataxia is caused by an expanded GAA triplet-repeat 
      sequence in intron 1 of the FXN gene that results in epigenetic silencing of the 
      FXN promoter. This silencing mechanism is seen in patient-derived lymphoblastoid 
      cells but it remains unknown if it is a widespread phenomenon affecting multiple 
      cell types and tissues. METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The humanized mouse 
      model of Friedreich ataxia (YG8sR), which carries a single transgenic insert of 
      the human FXN gene with an expanded GAA triplet-repeat in intron 1, is deficient 
      for FXN transcript when compared to an isogenic transgenic mouse lacking the 
      expanded repeat (Y47R). We found that in YG8sR the deficiency of FXN transcript 
      extended both upstream and downstream of the expanded GAA triplet-repeat, 
      suggestive of deficient transcriptional initiation. This pattern of deficiency 
      was seen in all tissues tested, irrespective of whether they are known to be 
      affected or spared in disease pathogenesis, in both neuronal and non-neuronal 
      tissues, and in cultured primary fibroblasts. FXN promoter function was directly 
      measured via metabolic labeling of newly synthesized transcripts in fibroblasts, 
      which revealed that the YG8sR mouse was significantly deficient in 
      transcriptional initiation compared to the Y47R mouse. CONCLUSIONS / 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Deficient transcriptional initiation accounts for FXN 
      transcriptional deficiency in the humanized mouse model of Friedreich ataxia, 
      similar to patient-derived cells, and the mechanism underlying promoter silencing 
      in Friedreich ataxia is widespread across multiple cell types and tissues.

AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a member of the Repeat Expansion Diseases, a group of 
      genetic conditions resulting from an increase/expansion in the size of a specific 
      tandem array. FRDA results from expansion of a GAA/TTC-tract in the first intron 
      of the frataxin gene (FXN). The disease-associated tandem repeats all form 
      secondary structures that are thought to contribute to the propensity of the 
      repeat to expand. The subset of these diseases that result from a CGG/CCG-repeat 
      expansion, such as Fragile X syndrome, also express a folate-sensitive fragile 
      site coincident with the repeat on the affected chromosome. This chromosome 
      fragility involves the generation of chromosome/chromatid gaps or breaks, or the 
      high frequency loss of one or both copies of the affected gene when cells are 
      grown under folate stress or as we showed previously, in the presence of an 
      inhibitor of the ATM checkpoint kinase. Whether Repeat Expansion Disease loci 
      containing different repeats form similar fragile sites was not known. We show 
      here that the region of chromosome 9 that contains the FXN locus is intrinsically 
      prone to breakage in vivo even in control cells. However, like FXS alleles, FRDA 
      alleles show significantly elevated levels of chromosome abnormalities in the 
      presence of an ATM inhibitor, consistent with the formation of a fragile site.

TI  - Frataxin levels in peripheral tissue in Friedreich ataxia.
PG  - 831-42
LID - 10.1002/acn3.225 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive ataxia resulting 
      from mutations in the frataxin gene (FXN). Such mutations, usually expanded 
      guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) repeats, give rise to decreased levels of frataxin 
      protein in both affected and unaffected tissues. The goal was to understand the 
      relationship of frataxin levels in peripheral tissues to disease status. METHODS: 
      Frataxin levels were measured in buccal cells and blood, and analyzed in relation 
      to disease features. Site-directed mutant frataxin was also transfected into 
      human embryonic kidney cells to model results from specific point mutations. 
      RESULTS: There was no evidence for change in frataxin levels over time with 
      repeated measures analysis, although linear regression analysis of 
      cross-sectional data predicted a small increase over decades. GAA repeat length 
      predicted frataxin levels in both tissues, and frataxin levels themselves 
      predicted neurological ratings (accounting for age). Compound heterozygous 
      patients for a GAA expansion and a point mutation in FXN generally had lower 
      levels of frataxin than those homozygous for the presence of two GAA repeat 
      expansions, though levels varied dramatically between tissues in some compound 
      heterozygotes for point mutations. The G130V mutation led to decreased levels of 
      frataxin in vitro as well as in vivo, while the R165C mutation produced normal 
      immunoreactive levels of frataxin both in vitro and in vivo. Start codon 
      mutations led to low levels of frataxin in buccal cells but preserved 
      immunoreactive frataxin levels in blood. INTERPRETATION: The present data show 
      that peripheral frataxin levels reflect disease features in FRDA, but emphasize 
      the need for interpretation of such levels in the context of specific mutations.

LID - 108
AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive hereditary 
      spinocerebellar disorder, characterized by progressive limb and gait ataxia due 
      to proprioceptive loss, often complicated by cardiomyopathy, diabetes and 
      skeletal deformities. Friedreich ataxia is the most common hereditary ataxia, 
      with a reported prevalence of 1:20 000 - 1:50 000 in Central Europe. Previous 
      reports from south Norway have found a prevalence varying from 1:100 000 - 1:1 
      350 000; no studies are previously done in the rest of the country. METHODS: In 
      this cross-sectional study, Friedreich ataxia patients were identified through 
      colleagues in neurological, pediatric and genetic departments, hospital archives 
      searches, patients' associations, and National Centre for Rare Disorders. All 
      included patients, carriers and controls were investigated clinically and 
      molecularly with genotype characterization including size determination of GAA 
      repeat expansions and frataxin measurements. 1376 healthy blood donors were 
      tested for GAA repeat expansion for carrier frequency analysis. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-nine Friedreich ataxia patients were identified in Norway, of which 23 
      were ethnic Norwegian, corresponding to a prevalence of 1:176 000 and 1:191 000, 
      respectively. The highest prevalence was seen in the north. Carrier frequency of 
      1:196 (95 % CI = [1:752-1:112]) was found. Homozygous GAA repeat expansions in 
      the FXN gene were found in 27/29, while two patients were compound heterozygous 
      with c.467 T < C, L157P and the deletion (g.120032_122808del) including exon 5a. 
      Two additional patients were heterozygous for GAA repeat expansions only. 
      Significant differences in the level of frataxin were found between the included 
      patients (N = 27), carriers (N = 37) and controls (N = 27). CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      first thorough study of a complete national cohort of Friedreich ataxia patients, 
      and first nation-wide study of Friedreich ataxia in Norway, the prevalence of 
      Friedreich ataxia in Norway is lower than in Central Europe, but higher than in 
      the last Norwegian report, and as expected from migration studies. A south-north 
      prevalence gradient is present. Based on Hardy Weinberg's equilibrium, the 
      carrier frequency of 1:196 is consistent with the observed prevalence. All 
      genotypes, and typical and atypical phenotypes were present in the Norwegian 
      population. The patients were phenotypically similar to European cohorts. 
      Frataxin was useful in the diagnostic work-up of heterozygous symptomatic cases.

AB  - The classic phenotype of Friedreich ataxia is characterized by dysarthria, 
      progressive limb and trunk ataxia, loss of reflexes, and gait disturbance with 
      the onset of disease before the second decade. Homozygous trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion of GAA in the FXN gene is found in 98% of patients. Two-5% of all 
      patients have a repeat expansion on one allele and a point mutation on the other 
      allele. Atypical phenotype is found in 25% of patients. A 10-year-old boy 
      presented with congenital biliary atresia and progressive gait abnormality. His 
      examination was significant for spastic gait, hyperreflexia, and sensory 
      neuropathy. Genetic testing revealed a compound heterozygous mutation in the FXN 
      gene. The absence of dysarthria and ataxia, retention of reflexes, absence of 
      diabetes, and variable development of cardiomyopathy support a slow progression 
      of disease with compound heterozygous mutation at G130V. Missense mutations are 
      rare causes of Friedreich ataxia that can only be detected by sequencing of the 
      FXN gene. Sequencing of the FXN gene is essential to make an early diagnosis when 
      there is an atypical phenotype.

AB  - Purine repeat sequences present in the human genome are known to act as hotspots 
      for mutations leading to chromosomal imbalances. It is established that large 
      purine repeats (PRs) form stable DNA triplex structure which can inhibit gene 
      expression. Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), the autosomal neurodegenerative disorder 
      is the only human disease known so far, where a large purine (GAA) repeat in the 
      FXN gene is known to inhibit the expression of frataxin protein. We explored the 
      hidden purine repeats (PRn with n >/= 200) if any, in the human genome to find out 
      how they are associated with neurological disorders. The results showed 28 PRs, 
      which are mostly restricted to the intronic regions. Interestingly, the 
      transcriptome expression analysis of PR-carrying genes (PR-genes) revealed that 
      most of them are down-regulated in neurological disorders (autism, Alzheimer's 
      disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, mental retardation, Parkinson's disease, brain 
      tumor) as compared to that in healthy controls. The altered gene expression in 
      brain disorders can be interpreted in terms of a possible expansion of purine 
      repeats leading to formation of very stable DNA-triplex and/or alleviation of the 
      repair enzymes and/or other unknown cellular factors. Interactome analysis 
      identified four PR-genes in signaling pathways whose dysregulation is correlated 
      directly with pathogenesis: GRK5 and KLK6 in Alzheimer's disease; FGF14 in 
      craniosynostosis, mental retardation and FLT1 in neuroferritinopathy. By virtue 
      of being mutational hotspots and their ability to form DNA-triplex, purine 
      repeats in genome disturb the genome integrity and interfere with the 
      transcriptional regulation. However, validation of the disease linkage of 
      PR-genes can be validated using knock-out techniques.

AB  - A hexanucleotide repeat expansion residing within the C9ORF72 gene represents the 
      most common known cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and places the 
      disease among a growing family of repeat expansion disorders. The presence of RNA 
      foci, repeat-associated translation products, and sequestration of RNA binding 
      proteins suggests that toxic RNA gain-of-function contributes to pathology while 
      C9ORF72 haploinsufficiency may be an additional pathological factor. One viable 
      therapeutic strategy for treating expansion diseases is the use of small molecule 
      inhibitors of epigenetic modifier proteins to reactivate expanded genetic loci. 
      Indeed, previous studies have established proof of this principle by increasing 
      the drug-induced expression of expanded (and abnormally heterochromatinized) 
      FMR1, FXN and C9ORF72 genes in respective patient cells. While epigenetic 
      modifier proteins are increasingly recognized as druggable targets, there have 
      been few screening strategies to address this avenue of drug discovery in the 
      context of expansion diseases. Here we utilize a semi-high-throughput gene 
      expression based screen to identify siRNAs and small molecule inhibitors of 
      epigenetic modifier proteins that regulate C9ORF72 RNA in patient fibroblasts, 
      lymphocytes and reprogrammed motor neurons. We found that several bromodomain 
      small molecule inhibitors increase the expression of C9ORF72 mRNA and pre-mRNA 
      without affecting repressive epigenetic signatures of expanded C9ORF72 alleles. 
      These data suggest that bromodomain inhibition increases the expression of 
      unexpanded C9ORF72 alleles and may therefore compensate for haploinsufficiency 
      without increasing the production of toxic RNA and protein products, thereby 
      conferring therapeutic value.

TI  - An open-label trial in Friedreich ataxia suggests clinical benefit with high-dose 
      resveratrol, without effect on frataxin levels.
PG  - 1344-53
LID - 10.1007/s00415-015-7719-2 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is due to a triplet repeat expansion in FXN, resulting 
      in deficiency of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Resveratrol is a naturally 
      occurring polyphenol, identified to increase frataxin expression in cellular and 
      mouse models of FRDA and has anti-oxidant properties. This open-label, 
      non-randomized trial evaluated the effect of two different doses of resveratrol 
      on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) frataxin levels over a 12-week period 
      in individuals with FRDA. Secondary outcome measures included PMBC FXN mRNA, 
      oxidative stress markers, and clinical measures of disease severity. Safety and 
      tolerability were studied. Twenty-four participants completed the study; 12 
      received low-dose resveratrol (1 g daily) and 12 high-dose resveratrol (5 g 
      daily). PBMC frataxin levels did not change in either dosage group [low-dose 
      group change: 0.08 pg/mug protein (95% CI -0.05, 0.21, p = 0.21); high-dose group 
      change: 0.03 pg/mug protein (95% CI -0.10, 0.15, p = 0.62)]. Improvement in 
      neurologic function was evident in the high-dose group [change in Friedreich 
      Ataxia Rating Scale -3.4 points, 95% CI (-6.6, -0.3), p = 0.036], but not the 
      low-dose group. Significant improvements in audiologic and speech measures, and 
      in the oxidative stress marker plasma F2-isoprostane were demonstrated in the 
      high-dose group only. There were no improvements in cardiac measures or 
      patient-reported outcome measures. No serious adverse events were recorded. 
      Gastrointestinal side-effects were a common, dose-related adverse event. This 
      open-label study shows no effect of resveratrol on frataxin levels in FRDA, but 
      suggests that independent positive clinical and biologic effects of high-dose 
      resveratrol may exist. Further assessment of efficacy is warranted in a 
      randomized placebo-controlled trial.

AB  - Reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein Frataxin (FXN) is the underlying 
      cause of Friedreich's ataxia. We propose a model of premature termination of FXN 
      transcription induced by pathogenic expanded GAA repeats that links R-loop 
      structures, antisense transcription, and heterochromatin formation as a novel 
      mechanism of transcriptional repression in Friedreich's ataxia.

TI  - Expanded GAA repeats impair FXN gene expression and reposition the FXN locus to 
      the nuclear lamina in single cells.
PG  - 3457-71
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddv096 [doi]
AB  - Abnormally expanded DNA repeats are associated with several neurodegenerative 
      diseases. In Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), expanded GAA repeats in intron 1 of the 
      frataxin gene (FXN) reduce FXN mRNA levels in averaged cell samples through a 
      poorly understood mechanism. By visualizing FXN expression and nuclear 
      localization in single cells, we show that GAA-expanded repeats decrease the 
      number of FXN mRNA molecules, slow transcription, and increase FXN localization 
      at the nuclear lamina (NL). Restoring histone acetylation reverses NL 
      positioning. Expanded GAA-FXN loci in FRDA patient cells show increased NL 
      localization with increased silencing of alleles and reduced transcription from 
      alleles positioned peripherally. We also demonstrate inefficiencies in 
      transcription initiation and elongation from the expanded GAA-FXN locus at 
      single-cell resolution. We suggest that repressive epigenetic modifications at 
      the expanded GAA-FXN locus may lead to NL relocation, where further repression 
      may occur.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurological disease caused 
      by expansions of guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) repeats in intron 1 of the 
      frataxin (FXN) gene. The expansion results in significantly decreased frataxin 
      expression. We report that human FRDA cells can be corrected by zinc finger 
      nuclease-mediated excision of the expanded GAA repeats. Editing of a single 
      expanded GAA allele created heterozygous, FRDA carrier-like cells and 
      significantly increased frataxin expression. This correction persisted during 
      reprogramming of zinc finger nuclease-edited fibroblasts to induced pluripotent 
      stem cells and subsequent differentiation into neurons. The expression of FRDA 
      biomarkers was normalized in corrected patient cells and disease-associated 
      phenotypes, such as decreases in aconitase activity and intracellular ATP levels, 
      were reversed in zinc finger nuclease corrected neuronal cells. Genetically and 
      phenotypically corrected patient cells represent not only a preferred 
      disease-relevant model system to study pathogenic mechanisms, but also a critical 
      step towards development of cell replacement therapy.

TI  - Very late-onset friedreich ataxia with laryngeal dystonia.
PG  - 287-90
LID - 10.1159/000370062 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by progressive gait and limb ataxia, cerebellar, pyramidal and 
      dorsal column involvement, visual defects, scoliosis, pes cavus and 
      cardiomyopathy. It is caused by a homozygous guanine-adenine-adenine (GAA) 
      trinucleotide repeat expansion in intron 1 of the frataxin gene (FXN) on 
      chromosome 9q13-q21.1. Onset is usually in the first or second decade of life; 
      however, late-onset cases of Freidreich ataxia (LOFA), after the age of 25 years, 
      and very late-onset cases of Freidreich ataxia (VLOFA), after the age of 40 
      years, have been reported. VLOFA is quite rare and usually presents a milder 
      progression of the disease. We report the case of a 64-year-old woman affected 
      with VLOFA whose first symptoms (balance and gait disturbances) occurred at the 
      age of 44 years. At the age of 62 years, she started complaining of a slowly 
      progressive dysphonia showing the clinical aspects of laryngeal dystonia. 
      Molecular analysis showed a 210- and 230-trinucleotide GAA repeat expansion in 
      the two alleles of the FXN gene. Laryngeal dystonia has been reported only in 
      very few cases of ataxia syndrome and never before in FRDA patients. It may 
      represent a rare clinical manifestation of VLOFA thus confirming the high 
      variability of the clinical spectrum of FRDA.

TI  - A novel GAA-repeat-expansion-based mouse model of Friedreich's ataxia.
PG  - 225-35
LID - 10.1242/dmm.018952 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by a GAA repeat expansion mutation within intron 1 of the FXN gene, 
      resulting in reduced levels of frataxin protein. We have previously reported the 
      generation of human FXN yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) transgenic FRDA mouse 
      models containing 90-190 GAA repeats, but the presence of multiple GAA repeats 
      within these mice is considered suboptimal. We now describe the cellular, 
      molecular and behavioural characterisation of a newly developed YAC transgenic 
      FRDA mouse model, designated YG8sR, which we have shown by DNA sequencing to 
      contain a single pure GAA repeat expansion. The founder YG8sR mouse contained 120 
      GAA repeats but, due to intergenerational expansion, we have now established a 
      colony of YG8sR mice that contain ~200 GAA repeats. We show that YG8sR mice have 
      a single copy of the FXN transgene, which is integrated at a single site as 
      confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis of metaphase and 
      interphase chromosomes. We have identified significant behavioural deficits, 
      together with a degree of glucose intolerance and insulin hypersensitivity, in 
      YG8sR FRDA mice compared with control Y47R and wild-type (WT) mice. We have also 
      detected increased somatic GAA repeat instability in the brain and cerebellum of 
      YG8sR mice, together with significantly reduced expression of FXN, FAST-1 and 
      frataxin, and reduced aconitase activity, compared with Y47R mice. Furthermore, 
      we have confirmed the presence of pathological vacuoles within neurons of the 
      dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of YG8sR mice. These novel GAA-repeat-expansion-based 
      YAC transgenic FRDA mice, which exhibit progressive FRDA-like pathology, 
      represent an excellent model for the investigation of FRDA disease mechanisms and 
      therapy.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia is a neurodegenerative disease caused by deficiency of the 
      mitochondrial protein frataxin. This deficiency results from expansion of a 
      trinucleotide repeat in the first intron of the frataxin gene. Because this 
      repeat expansion resides in an intron and hence does not alter the amino acid 
      sequence of the frataxin protein, gene reactivation could be of therapeutic 
      benefit. High-throughput screening for frataxin activators has so far met with 
      limited success because current cellular models may not accurately assess 
      endogenous frataxin gene regulation. Here we report the design and validation of 
      genome-engineering tools that enable the generation of human cell lines that 
      express the frataxin gene fused to a luciferase reporter gene from its endogenous 
      locus. Performing a pilot high-throughput genomic screen in a newly established 
      reporter cell line, we uncovered novel negative regulators of frataxin 
      expression. Rational design of small-molecule inhibitors of the identified 
      frataxin repressors and/or high-throughput screening of large siRNA or compound 
      libraries with our system may yield treatments for Friedreich's ataxia.

AB  - Perceptual speech research in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) has identified altered 
      nasality as a key component of the dysarthria profile, however the incidence and 
      severity of abnormal nasality remains unknown. Utilizing objective and perceptual 
      methods, data on the relationship between resonance, disease duration, severity, 
      age of onset and genetic profiles were collated. Thirty-seven participants with 
      FRDA and 24 healthy controls provided contemporaneous speech samples for 
      perceptual analysis, and single word samples for acoustic analysis. A subset of 
      participants (eight participants with FRDA and eight controls) underwent 
      nasometry assessment. Twenty-seven participants with FRDA presented with 
      hypernasality and five with hyponasality on perceptual assessment. Acoustic 
      analysis revealed participants with FRDA had greater nasality than controls 
      (p < 0.05). Perceptual ratings of hypernasality correlated with GAA2 repeat 
      length (rho = 0.37, p = 0.03). Findings highlight the variability of nasality in 
      FRDA, potentially reflecting variation in the neuropathological profile. Data 
      also suggest the influence of genetic profiles on nasality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative 
      disorder, caused by a GAA repeat expansion mutation within intron 1 of the FXN 
      gene. We have previously established and performed preliminary characterisation 
      of several human FXN yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) transgenic FRDA mouse 
      models containing GAA repeat expansions, Y47R (9 GAA repeats), YG8R (90 and 190 
      GAA repeats) and YG22R (190 GAA repeats). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We now 
      report extended cellular, molecular and functional characterisation of these FXN 
      YAC transgenic mouse models. FXN transgene copy number analysis of the FRDA mice 
      demonstrated that the YG22R and Y47R lines each have a single copy of the FXN 
      transgene while the YG8R line has two copies. Single integration sites of all 
      transgenes were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis 
      of metaphase and interphase chromosomes. We identified significant functional 
      deficits, together with a degree of glucose intolerance and insulin 
      hypersensitivity, in YG8R and YG22R FRDA mice compared to Y47R and wild-type 
      control mice. We also confirmed increased somatic GAA repeat instability in the 
      cerebellum and brain of YG22R and YG8R mice, together with significantly reduced 
      levels of FXN mRNA and protein in the brain and liver of YG8R and YG22R compared 
      to Y47R. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together these studies provide a detailed 
      characterisation of our GAA repeat expansion-based YAC transgenic FRDA mouse 
      models that will help investigations of FRDA disease mechanisms and therapy.

TI  - Epigenetic promoter silencing in Friedreich ataxia is dependent on repeat length.
PG  - 522-8
LID - 10.1002/ana.24249 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is caused by an expanded GAA triplet-repeat 
      (GAA-TR) mutation in the FXN gene. Patients are typically homozygous for expanded 
      alleles containing 100 to 1,300 triplets, and phenotypic severity is 
      significantly correlated with the length of the shorter of the 2 expanded 
      alleles. Patients have a severe deficiency of FXN transcript, which is 
      predominantly caused by epigenetic silencing of the FXN promoter. We sought to 
      determine whether the severity of FXN promoter silencing is related to the length 
      of the expanded GAA-TR mutation in FRDA. METHODS: Patient-derived lymphoblastoid 
      cell lines bearing a range of expanded alleles (200-1,122 triplets) were 
      evaluated for FXN transcript levels by quantitative reverse transcriptase 
      polymerase chain reaction. FXN promoter function was directly measured by 
      quantitative analysis of transcriptional initiation via metabolic labeling of 
      newly synthesized transcripts in living cells. RESULTS: FXN transcriptional 
      deficiency was significantly correlated with the length of the shorter of the 2 
      expanded alleles, which was noted both upstream (R(2)  = 0.84, p = 0.014) and 
      downstream (R(2)  = 0.89, p = 0.002) of the expanded GAA-TR mutation, suggesting 
      that FXN promoter silencing in FRDA is related to repeat length. A bilinear 
      regression model revealed that length dependence was strongest when the shorter 
      of the 2 expanded alleles contained <400 triplets. Direct measurement of FXN 
      promoter activity in patients with expanded alleles containing <400 versus >400 
      triplets in the shorter of the 2 expanded alleles revealed a significantly 
      greater deficiency in individuals with longer GAA-TR alleles (p < 0.05). 
      INTERPRETATION: FXN promoter silencing in FRDA is dependent on the length of the 
      expanded GAA-TR mutation.

TI  - Sensitivity of spatiotemporal gait parameters in measuring disease severity in 
      Friedreich ataxia.
PG  - 677-88
LID - 10.1007/s12311-014-0583-2 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive disease with gait ataxia being 
      the main source of morbidity. Mobility progressively declines, from initial 
      symptom onset at approximately 10-15 years of age to being unable to ambulate 
      10-15 years later. Here, we sought to investigate the relationship between 
      spatiotemporal gait parameters and clinical markers of disease severity. Thirteen 
      people with FRDA walked along an 8.3-m GAITRite(R) mat six times each at their 
      preferred fast and slow speeds. Relationships between spatiotemporal gait 
      parameters and a range of clinical and disease characteristics were examined. 
      Significant correlations were found between spatiotemporal gait characteristics 
      at each of the walking speeds and Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) score and 
      disease duration. During the fast-walking condition, gait speed and cadence 
      decreased with an increase in disease duration and the FARS score. GAA1 repeat 
      expansion negatively correlated with double-support percentage of the gait cycle 
      in all speed conditions demonstrating a relationship between the genetic mutation 
      and compensatory strategies for impaired dynamic balance. In all speed 
      conditions, there were correlations between a range of spatiotemporal gait 
      characteristics and the timed 25-ft walk test, a well-established measure of gait 
      mobility. These findings suggest that spatiotemporal gait parameters are a 
      sensitive measure of gait decline in individuals with FRDA and should be 
      considered for inclusion in intervention studies whilst participants are still 
      ambulant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), the most common autosomal recessive ataxia 
      disorder, is caused by a dynamic GAA repeat expansion mutation within intron 1 of 
      FXN gene, resulting in down-regulation of frataxin expression. Studies of cell 
      and mouse models have revealed a role for the mismatch repair (MMR) 
      MutS-heterodimer complexes and the PMS2 component of the MutLalpha complex in the 
      dynamics of intergenerational and somatic GAA repeat expansions: MSH2, MSH3 and 
      MSH6 promote GAA repeat expansions, while PMS2 inhibits GAA repeat expansions. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To determine the potential role of the other 
      component of the MutLalpha complex, MLH1, in GAA repeat instability in FRDA, we have 
      analyzed intergenerational and somatic GAA repeat expansions from FXN transgenic 
      mice that have been crossed with Mlh1 deficient mice. We find that loss of Mlh1 
      activity reduces both intergenerational and somatic GAA repeat expansions. 
      However, we also find that loss of either Mlh1 or Pms2 reduces FXN transcription, 
      suggesting different mechanisms of action for Mlh1 and Pms2 on GAA repeat 
      expansion dynamics and regulation of FXN transcription. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Both MutLalpha components, PMS2 and MLH1, have now been shown to modify the molecular 
      phenotype of FRDA. We propose that upregulation of MLH1 or PMS2 could be 
      potential FRDA therapeutic approaches to increase FXN transcription.

AB  - We advance the overarching hypothesis that stem cell therapy is a potent 
      treatment for Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). Here, we discuss the feasibility of 
      autologous transplantation in FRDA, highlighting the need for the successful 
      isolation of the FRDA patient's bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, 
      followed by characterization that these cells maintain the GAA repeat expansion 
      and the reduced FXN mRNA expression, both hallmark features of FRDA. Next, we 
      discuss the need for assessment of the proliferative capability and pluripotency 
      of FRDA patient's bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. In particular, we 
      view the need for characterizing the in vitro differentiation of bone 
      marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells into the two cell types primarily affected 
      in FRDA, peripheral neurons and cardiomyocytes. Finally, we discuss the need to 
      test the application of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells as potent 
      autologous donor cells for FRDA. The demonstration of the functional correction 
      of the mutated gene in these cells will be a critical endpoint of determining the 
      potential of stem cell therapy in FRDA. We envision a gene-based cell transplant 
      strategy as a likely therapeutic approach for FRDA, involving stable insertion of 
      functional human bacterial artificial chromosomes or BACs containing the intact 
      FXN gene into stem cells, thereafter leading to the expression of frataxin 
      protein in differentiated neurons/cardiomyocytes.

LID - 10.1007/s12311-014-0568-1 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is the most common inherited neurodegenerative ataxia. 
      Apart from predominant neurological features an involvement of the skeletal 
      system in terms of scoliosis and foot deformities is frequent. Disease-related 
      falls, mobility restrictions, and wheelchair-dependency in later disease stages 
      might additionally compromise bone structure in FRDA. The aim of this pilot study 
      was to systematically evaluate the bone status in a representative FRDA cohort. 
      Twenty-eight FRDA patients became enrolled in this cross-sectional study. 
      Neurological assessment, a questionnaire comprising the history of fractures and 
      osteoporosis as well as osteodensitometric measurements complemented with general 
      and bone-specific laboratory parameters were performed. The WHO Fracture Risk 
      Assessment tool (FRAX(R)) was applied, calculating the 10-year risk of suffering an 
      osteoporotic fracture. Six patients (21.4 %) presented with a bone mineral 
      density below the expected range for age in at least one of the examined sites 
      (femoral neck, lumbar spine, and forearm) irrespective of their gender. 
      Corresponding Z scores were significantly lower compared to normative values for 
      the femoral neck and lumbar spine. Vitamin D status was insufficient in 11 and 
      deficient in 8 FRDA patients. There was a strong negative correlation between 
      ataxia severity, GAA repeat expansion and bone density in the femoral neck of 
      FRDA patients. This is the first report of an increased rate of low bone mineral 
      density in FRDA. Given the increased risk of falls, this data rectifies routine 
      bone mineral density measurements in FRDA which may help to initiate therapeutic 
      interventions to prevent this condition.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between disease features in Friedreich 
      ataxia and aberrant glucose metabolism. METHODS: Fasting glucose, fasting insulin 
      and random HbA1C were obtained in 158 patients with Friedreich ataxia. Regression 
      analysis evaluated glucose, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) of 
      insulin resistance (IR) and beta-cell function (ss) in relation to age, BMI, sex, 
      and genetic severity. Categorical glucose values were analyzed in relation to 
      other FRDA-associated disease characteristics. RESULTS: In the FRDA cohort, age 
      and GAA repeat length predicted fasting glucose and HbA1c levels (accounting for 
      sex and BMI), while insulin and HOMA-IR were not predicted by these parameters. 
      Within the cohort, average BMI was consistently lower than the national average 
      by age and was marginally associated with insulin levels and HOMA-IR. Within 
      juvenile subjects, insulin and HOMA-IR were predicted by age. Controlling for age 
      and genetic severity, diabetes-related measures were not independent predictors 
      of any quantitative measure of disease severity in FRDA. Glucose handling 
      properties were also predicted by the presence of a point mutation, with 40% of 
      individuals heterozygous for point mutations having diabetes, compared to 4.3% of 
      subjects who carried two expanded GAA repeats. INTERPRETATION: In FRDA, aberrant 
      glucose metabolism is linked to increasing age, longer GAA repeat length on the 
      shorter allele, frataxin point mutations, and increasing BMI. The effect of age 
      to some degree may be mediated through changes in BMI, with increasing age 
      associated with increases in BMI, and with HOMA-IR and insulin increases in 
      children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Compound heterozygosity for a trinucleotide repeat expansion and a 
      point mutation in the FXN gene is a rare cause of Friedreich ataxia (FRDA). 
      METHODS: We identified three Swedish FRDA patients with an FXN p.R165P missense 
      mutation and compared their clinical features with six homozygote trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion carriers. Patients were assessed clinically. Trinucleotide 
      expansion length was determined and lymphocyte frataxin levels measured. RESULTS: 
      p.R165P mutation carriers became wheelchair bound early, but had retained 
      reflexes, better arm function, milder dysarthria, and were more independent in 
      activities of daily living. One p.R165P mutation carrier developed psychosis. 
      Frataxin levels were higher than in homozygous trinucleotide expansion patients. 
      One patient with homozygous trinucleotide repeat expansions and comorbid 
      hemochromatosis had more severe FRDA symptoms than his sibling without 
      hemochromatosis. CONCLUSION: p.R165P patients progress to a less disabling 
      disease state than typical FRDA. Comorbid hemochromatosis may worsen FRDA 
      symptoms through additive effects on iron metabolism.

AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) and Fragile X syndrome (FXS) are among 40 diseases 
      associated with expansion of repeated sequences (TREDs). Although their molecular 
      pathology is not well understood, formation of repressive chromatin and unusual 
      DNA structures over repeat regions were proposed to play a role. Our study now 
      shows that RNA/DNA hybrids (R-loops) form in patient cells on expanded repeats of 
      endogenous FXN and FMR1 genes, associated with FRDA and FXS. These 
      transcription-dependent R-loops are stable, co-localise with repressive H3K9me2 
      chromatin mark and impede RNA Polymerase II transcription in patient cells. We 
      investigated the interplay between repressive chromatin marks and R-loops on the 
      FXN gene. We show that decrease in repressive H3K9me2 chromatin mark has no 
      effect on R-loop levels. Importantly, increasing R-loop levels by treatment with 
      DNA topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin leads to up-regulation of repressive 
      chromatin marks, resulting in FXN transcriptional silencing. This provides a 
      direct molecular link between R-loops and the pathology of TREDs, suggesting that 
      R-loops act as an initial trigger to promote FXN and FMR1 silencing. Thus R-loops 
      represent a common feature of nucleotide expansion disorders and provide a new 
      target for therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Frataxin silencing inactivates mitochondrial Complex I in NSC34 motoneuronal 
      cells and alters glutathione homeostasis.
PG  - 5789-806
LID - 10.3390/ijms15045789 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized by a reduced synthesis of the mitochondrial iron chaperon protein 
      frataxin as a result of a large GAA triplet-repeat expansion within the first 
      intron of the frataxin gene. Despite neurodegeneration being the prominent 
      feature of this pathology involving both the central and the peripheral nervous 
      system, information on the impact of frataxin deficiency in neurons is scant. 
      Here, we describe a neuronal model displaying some major biochemical and 
      morphological features of FRDA. By silencing the mouse NSC34 motor neurons for 
      the frataxin gene with shRNA lentiviral vectors, we generated two cell lines with 
      40% and 70% residual amounts of frataxin, respectively. Frataxin-deficient cells 
      showed a specific inhibition of mitochondrial Complex I (CI) activity already at 
      70% residual frataxin levels, whereas the glutathione imbalance progressively 
      increased after silencing. These biochemical defects were associated with the 
      inhibition of cell proliferation and morphological changes at the axonal 
      compartment, both depending on the frataxin amount. Interestingly, at 70% 
      residual frataxin levels, the in vivo treatment with the reduced glutathione 
      revealed a partial rescue of cell proliferation. Thus, NSC34 frataxin silenced 
      cells could be a suitable model to study the effect of frataxin deficiency in 
      neurons and highlight glutathione as a potential beneficial therapeutic target 
      for FRDA.

AB  - Expansion of GAA.TTC repeats within the first intron of the frataxin gene is the 
      cause of Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative 
      disorder. However, no effective treatment for the disease has been developed as 
      yet. In this study, we explored a possibility of shortening expanded GAA repeats 
      associated with FRDA through chemotherapeutically-induced DNA base lesions and 
      subsequent base excision repair (BER). We provide the first evidence that 
      alkylated DNA damage induced by temozolomide, a chemotherapeutic DNA damaging 
      agent can induce massive GAA repeat contractions/deletions, but only limited 
      expansions in FRDA patient lymphoblasts. We showed that temozolomide-induced GAA 
      repeat instability was mediated by BER. Further characterization of BER of an 
      abasic site in the context of (GAA)20 repeats indicates that the lesion mainly 
      resulted in a large deletion of 8 repeats along with small expansions. This was 
      because temozolomide-induced single-stranded breaks initially led to DNA slippage 
      and the formation of a small GAA repeat loop in the upstream region of the 
      damaged strand and a small TTC loop on the template strand. This allowed limited 
      pol beta DNA synthesis and the formation of a short 5'-GAA repeat flap that was 
      cleaved by FEN1, thereby leading to small repeat expansions. At a later stage of 
      BER, the small template loop expanded into a large template loop that resulted in 
      the formation of a long 5'-GAA repeat flap. Pol beta then performed limited DNA 
      synthesis to bypass the loop, and FEN1 removed the long repeat flap ultimately 
      causing a large repeat deletion. Our study indicates that 
      chemotherapeutically-induced alkylated DNA damage can induce large 
      contractions/deletions of expanded GAA repeats through BER in FRDA patient cells. 
      This further suggests the potential of developing chemotherapeutic alkylating 
      agents to shorten expanded GAA repeats for treatment of FRDA.

AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
      neurodegeneration and cardiomyopathy. The presence of a GAA trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in the first intron of the FXN gene results in the inhibition of gene 
      expression and an insufficiency of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. We 
      previously generated BAC-based transgenic mice containing an FXN-EGFP genomic 
      reporter construct in which the EGFP gene is fused in-frame immediately following 
      the final codon of exon 5a of the human FXN gene. These transgenic mice were 
      mated with mice heterozygous for a knockout mutation of the murine Fxn gene, to 
      generate mice homozygous for the Fxn knockout mutation and hemizygous or 
      homozygous for the human transgene. Rescue of the embryonic lethality that is 
      associated with homozygosity for the Fxn knockout mutation was observed. Rescue 
      mice displayed normal behavioral and histological parameters with normal 
      viability, fertility and life span and without any signs of aberrant phenotype. 
      Immunoblotting demonstrated the production of full-length frataxin-EGFP fusion 
      protein that appears to act as a bifunctional hybrid protein. This study shows 
      frataxin replacement may be a viable therapeutic option. Further, these mice 
      should provide a useful resource for the study of human FXN gene expression, 
      frataxin function, the evaluation of pharmacologic inducers of FXN expression in 
      a whole-animal model and provide a useful source of cells for stem cell 
      transplantation studies.

TI  - Novel Point Mutations in Frataxin Gene in Iranian Patients with Friedreich's 
      Ataxia.
PG  - 32-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Friedreich's ataxia is the most common form of hereditary ataxia with 
      autosomal recessive pattern. More than 96% of patients are homozygous for GAA 
      repeat extension on both alleles in the first intron of FXN gene and the 
      remaining patients have been shown to be heterozygous for a GAA extension in one 
      allele and point mutation in other allele. MATERIALS & METHODS: In this study, 
      exons of 1, 2, 3, and 5 of frataxin gene were searched by single strand 
      conformation polymorphism polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSCP) in 5 patients with 
      GAA extension in one allele. For detection of exact mutation, samples with band 
      shifts were sent for DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Three novel point mutations were 
      found in patients heterozygous for the GAA repeat expansion, p.S81A, p.Y123D, and 
      p.S192C. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that these point mutations in one allele 
      with GAA extension in another allele are associated with FRDA signs. Thus, these 
      results emphasize the importance of performing molecular genetic analysis for 
      point mutations in FRDA patients.

AB  - Homozygous trinucleotide expansions in the frataxin (FXN) gene are responsible 
      for Friedreich's ataxia. However, heterozygous trinucleotide expansion in FXN 
      results in a decreased expression of frataxin, a component of the mitochondrial 
      respiratory chain, and is associated with a subclinical metabolic phenotype. In 
      this study we thus investigated whether heterozygous FXN trinucleotide expansion 
      is a risk factor or modifier for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Genomic DNA 
      from familial and sporadic ALS patients and control individuals was tested for 
      extended FXN trinucleotide repeats by polymerase chain reaction analysis. 
      Screening of 652 ALS patients and 238 controls revealed a lower overall frequency 
      of heterozygously extended FXN repeats than expected. A significant difference in 
      the frequency of the FXN expansion or an associated modification of the disease 
      phenotype in ALS was not detected. Our findings strengthen the view that 
      different DNA repeat expansions are toxic on the basis of specific biological 
      mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by GAA repeat expansion in the first intron of the FXN gene, which 
      encodes frataxin, an essential mitochondrial protein. To further characterise the 
      molecular abnormalities associated with FRDA pathogenesis and to hasten drug 
      screening, the development and use of animal and cellular models is considered 
      essential. Studies of lower organisms have already contributed to understanding 
      FRDA disease pathology, but mammalian cells are more related to FRDA patient 
      cells in physiological terms. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have generated 
      fibroblast cells and neural stem cells (NSCs) from control Y47R mice (9 GAA 
      repeats) and GAA repeat expansion YG8R mice (190+120 GAA repeats). We then 
      differentiated the NSCs in to neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes as 
      confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis of cell specific markers. The three YG8R 
      mouse cell types (fibroblasts, NSCs and differentiated NSCs) exhibit GAA repeat 
      stability, together with reduced expression of frataxin and reduced aconitase 
      activity compared to control Y47R cells. Furthermore, YG8R cells also show 
      increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and downregulation of Pgc-1alpha and 
      antioxidant gene expression levels, especially Sod2. We also analysed various DNA 
      mismatch repair (MMR) gene expression levels and found that YG8R cells displayed 
      significant reduction in expression of several MMR genes, which may contribute to 
      the GAA repeat stability. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We describe the first 
      fibroblast and NSC models from YG8R FRDA mice and we confirm that the NSCs can be 
      differentiated into neurons and glia. These novel FRDA mouse cell models, which 
      exhibit a FRDA-like cellular and molecular phenotype, will be valuable resources 
      to further study FRDA molecular pathogenesis. They will also provide very useful 
      tools for preclinical testing of frataxin-increasing compounds for FRDA drug 
      therapy, for gene therapy, and as a source of cells for cell therapy testing in 
      FRDA mice.

AB  - Previous studies have examined DNA methylation in different trinucleotide repeat 
      diseases. We have combined this data and used a pattern searching algorithm to 
      identify motifs in the DNA surrounding aberrantly methylated CpGs found in the 
      DNA of patients with one of the three trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansion 
      diseases: fragile X syndrome (FRAXA), myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1), or 
      Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). We examined sequences surrounding both the variably 
      methylated (VM) CpGs, which are hypermethylated in patients compared with 
      unaffected controls, and the nonvariably methylated CpGs which remain either 
      always methylated (AM) or never methylated (NM) in both patients and controls. 
      Using the J48 algorithm of WEKA analysis, we identified that two patterns are all 
      that is necessary to classify our three regions CCGG * which is found in VM and 
      not in AM regions and AATT * which distinguished between NM and VM + AM using 
      proportional frequency. Furthermore, comparing our software with MEME software, 
      we have demonstrated that our software identifies more patterns than MEME in 
      these short DNA sequences. Thus, we present evidence that the DNA sequence 
      surrounding CpG can influence its susceptibility to be de novo methylated in a 
      disease state associated with a trinucleotide repeat.

PG  - 392-9
LID - 10.1007/s00415-013-7208-4 [doi]
AB  - Dysphagia in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) and its impact on quality of life is not 
      adequately understood. The objective of this study was to characterise dysphagia 
      in FRDA and to determine the impact of swallowing dysfunction on activities, 
      participation, and sense of well-being. Thirty-six individuals with a confirmed 
      diagnosis of FRDA were assessed via a clinical bedside examination (CBE), the 
      Royal Brisbane Hospital outcome measure for swallowing, an oral-motor examination 
      and the Australian therapy outcome measures for speech and swallowing (AusTOMS). 
      Data on swallowing function, diet modification and swallowing strategies were 
      collated. Thirty-three (91.67 %) participants exhibited clinical signs of 
      dysphagia according to the CBE, and all participants received ratings indicating 
      swallowing difficulties on at least one other measure. Dysphagia in FRDA is 
      characterised by oral and pharyngeal stage impairment relating to incoordination, 
      weakness and spasticity. A significant positive correlation was found between the 
      severity of impairment, activity, participation and distress/well-being on the 
      AusTOMS, suggesting that swallowing function decreases with overall reductions in 
      quality of life. A significant correlation was found between activity on the 
      AusTOMS and disease duration (r = -0.283, p = 0.012). No significant correlations 
      were found between dysphagia severity and GAA repeat length, age of onset or 
      disease severity. Participants employing diet modification and swallowing 
      strategies demonstrated higher dysphagia severity, activity limitations and 
      participation restrictions. These data advocate a holistic approach to dysphagia 
      management in FRDA. Early detection of swallowing impairment and consideration of 
      the potential impact dysphagia has on quality of life should be key aspects in 
      disease management.

TI  - Modeling of Friedreich ataxia-related iron overloading cardiomyopathy using 
      patient-specific-induced pluripotent stem cells.
PG  - 1831-44

AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), a recessive neurodegenerative disorder commonly 
      associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is due to GAA repeat expansions 
      within the first intron of the frataxin (FXN) gene encoding the mitochondrial 
      protein involved in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis. The triplet codon repeats 
      lead to heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing and loss of frataxin. 
      Nevertheless, inadequacy of existing FRDA-cardiac cellular models limited 
      cardiomyopathy studies. We tested the hypothesis that iron homeostasis 
      deregulation accelerates reduction in energy synthesis dynamics which contributes 
      to impaired cardiac calcium homeostasis and contractile force. Silencing of FXN 
      expressions occurred both in somatic FRDA-skin fibroblasts and two of the induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) clones; a sign of stress condition was shown in 
      FRDA-iPSC cardiomyocytes with disorganized mitochondrial network and 
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion; hypertrophic cardiac stress responses were 
      observed by an increase in alpha-actinin-positive cell sizes revealed by FACS 
      analysis as well as elevation in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) gene expression; 
      the intracellular iron accumulated in FRDA cardiomyocytes might be due to 
      attenuated negative feedback response of transferring receptor (TSFR) expression 
      and positive feedback response of ferritin (FTH1); energy synthesis dynamics, in 
      terms of ATP production rate, was impaired in FRDA-iPSC cardiomyocytes, which 
      were prone to iron overload condition. Energetic insufficiency determined slower 
      Ca(2+) transients by retarding calcium reuptake to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) 
      and impaired the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses to adrenergic 
      stimulation. Our data showed for the first time that FRDA-iPSCs cardiac 
      derivatives represent promising models to study cardiac stress response due to 
      impaired iron homeostasis condition and mitochondrial damages. The cardiomyopathy 
      phenotype was accelerated in an iron-overloaded condition early in calcium 
      homeostasis aspect.

AB  - Limited data exist on the spectrum of heredoataxias in Greece, including the 
      prevalence and phenotype of Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) and the prevalence and 
      subtypes of dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). We analyzed clinically and 
      investigated genetically for FRDA and triplet-repeat expansion SCAs a consecutive 
      series of 186 patients with suspected heredoataxia referred to Athens over 18 
      years. For prevalence estimates we included patients with molecular diagnosis 
      from Cyprus that were absent from the Athens cohort. The minimum prevalence of 
      FRDA was ~0.9/100,000, with clusters of high prevalence in Aegean islands. FRDA 
      was diagnosed in 73 probands. The genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of FRDA was 
      similar to other populations, with one patient compound heterozygote for a known 
      point mutation in FXN (Asn146Lys). Undiagnosed recessive ataxias included 
      FRDA-like and spastic ataxias. The minimum prevalence of dominant SCAs was 
      ~0.7/100,000. SCA1 (4), SCA7 (4), SCA2, SCA6, and SCA17 (1 each) probands were 
      identified. A molecular diagnosis was reached in 31% of dominant cases. 
      Undiagnosed dominant patients included a majority of type III autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxias. FRDA is the commonest heredoataxia in the Greek population 
      with prevalence towards the lower end of other European populations. Dominant 
      SCAs are almost as prevalent. SCA1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7 and SCA17 patients complete 
      the spectrum of cases with a specific molecular diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is caused by a homozygous GAA repeat 
      expansion mutation within intron 1 of the FXN gene, which induces epigenetic 
      changes and FXN gene silencing. Bisulfite sequencing studies have identified 
      5-methylcytosine (5 mC) DNA methylation as one of the epigenetic changes that may 
      be involved in this process. However, analysis of samples by bisulfite sequencing 
      is a time-consuming procedure. In addition, it has recently been shown that 
      5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hmC) is also present in mammalian DNA, and bisulfite 
      sequencing cannot distinguish between 5 hmC and 5 mC. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: We have developed specific MethylScreen restriction enzyme digestion 
      and qPCR-based protocols to more rapidly quantify DNA methylation at four CpG 
      sites in the FXN upstream GAA region. Increased DNA methylation was confirmed at 
      all four CpG sites in both FRDA cerebellum and heart tissues. We have also 
      analysed the DNA methylation status in FRDA cerebellum and heart tissues using an 
      approach that enables distinction between 5 hmC and 5 mC. Our analysis reveals 
      that the majority of DNA methylation in both FRDA and unaffected tissues actually 
      comprises 5 hmC rather than 5 mC. We have also identified decreased occupancy of 
      the chromatin insulator protein CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) at the FXN 5' UTR 
      region in the same FRDA cerebellum tissues. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Increased 
      DNA methylation at the FXN upstream GAA region, primarily 5 hmC rather than 5 mC, 
      and decreased CTCF occupancy at the FXN 5' UTR are associated with FRDA 
      disease-relevant human tissues. The role of such molecular mechanisms in FRDA 
      pathogenesis has now to be determined.

LID - 10.1002/jnr.23262 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive ataxia, characterized by 
      progressive gait ataxia, limb ataxia, dysarthria, and areflexia associated with 
      diabetes and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The primary cause of FRDA is the 
      presence of expanded DNA triplet (GAA) repeats in the first intron of the fxn 
      gene on chromosome 9q13. The expanded DNA repeats in fxn inhibit expression of 
      the protein frataxin, which leads to neuronal degeneration. The aim of the study 
      was to identify differentially expressed plasma proteins in FRDA patients for 
      their diagnostic/prognostic applications. Clinically suspected FRDA patients (n = 
      42) were assessed on the International Co-Operative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS), 
      and genetic confirmation was performed by analyzing (GAA) repeats via PCR. 
      Eighteen patients were confirmed to be homozygous for FRDA, with ICARS scores of 
      40 +/- 8. Plasma proteomics of homozygous FRDA patients and age- and gender-matched 
      healthy controls was done using two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis 
      and LC-MS/MS. Quantitative proteomic analysis (fold change >/=1.5; P < 0.05) 
      revealed 13 differentially expressed protein spots. These proteins were found to 
      be associated with neuropathy (alpha1-antitrypsin), ataxia (apolipoprotein A-I), 
      oxidative stress (albumin), altered lipid metabolism (apolipoprotein C-II, 
      C-III), etc. Further investigations of these differentially expressed proteins 
      can aid in identifying prognostic/diagnostic markers for FRDA.

TI  - A GAA repeat expansion reporter model of Friedreich's ataxia recapitulates the 
      genomic context and allows rapid screening of therapeutic compounds.
PG  - 5173-87
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddt370 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is caused by large GAA expansions in intron 1 of the 
      frataxin gene (FXN), which lead to reduced FXN expression through a mechanism not 
      fully understood. Understanding such mechanism is essential for the 
      identification of novel therapies for FRDA and this can be accelerated by the 
      development of cell models which recapitulate the genomic context of the FXN 
      locus and allow direct comparison of normal and expanded FXN loci with rapid 
      detection of frataxin levels. Here we describe the development of the first 
      GAA-expanded FXN genomic DNA reporter model of FRDA. We modified BAC vectors 
      carrying the whole FXN genomic DNA locus by inserting the luciferase gene in exon 
      5a of the FXN gene (pBAC-FXN-Luc) and replacing the six GAA repeats present in 
      the vector with an  approximately 310 GAA repeat expansion (pBAC-FXN-GAA-Luc). We generated 
      human clonal cell lines carrying the two vectors using site-specific integration 
      to allow direct comparison of normal and expanded FXN loci. We demonstrate that 
      the presence of expanded GAA repeats recapitulates the epigenetic modifications 
      and repression of gene expression seen in FRDA. We applied the GAA-expanded 
      reporter model to the screening of a library of novel small molecules and 
      identified one molecule which up-regulates FXN expression in FRDA patient primary 
      cells and restores normal histone acetylation around the GAA repeats. These 
      results suggest the potential use of genomic reporter cell models for the study 
      of FRDA and the identification of novel therapies, combining physiologically 
      relevant expression with the advantages of quantitative reporter gene expression.

TI  - Friedreich ataxia: executive control is related to disease onset and GAA repeat 
      length.
PG  - 9-16
LID - 10.1007/s12311-013-0513-8 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is the most frequent inherited ataxia. 
      Neuropsychological studies suggest that FRDA may be associated with specific 
      cognitive impairment. Very little is known about the relation between cognitive 
      performance, demographics and disease-related parameters, such as GAA repeat 
      size, age of onset and disease duration. The present investigation aimed at 
      assessing cognitive functions in a representative sample of FRDA patients and at 
      identifying the most relevant disease-related parameters. Twenty-nine adult FRDA 
      patients underwent neuropsychological tests assessing executive functions, 
      attention, memory and visual perception. Performance was compared with 28 age- 
      and education-matched controls as well as with standardized norms. The relation 
      between neuropsychological outcome, demographical variables and disease-related 
      parameters was assessed. Cognitive impairment affected only a subgroup of 
      patients and mostly concerned attentional and executive functions. Good cognitive 
      performance was associated with a later disease onset, shorter GAA repeat length 
      and lower burden of disease. Age at disease onset has been found to be a good 
      predictor when a cut-off of 14 years was chosen. No correlation was found between 
      cognitive performance and education, age or disease duration. The present study 
      extends earlier findings in FRDA showing that performance in attentional and 
      executive function tasks is best predicted by the age at disease onset. Moreover, 
      executive functions show a clear relationship to disease severity and repeat size 
      of the shorter GAA allele. These findings therefore have important implications 
      for patient counselling regarding education and career choices.

AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is caused by a GAA repeat expansion in the FXN gene 
      leading to reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Recombinant 
      human erythropoietin (rhuEPO) is suggested to increase frataxin levels, alter 
      mitochondrial function and improve clinical scores in FRDA patients. Aim of the 
      present pilot study was to investigate mitochondrial metabolism of skeletal 
      muscle tissue in FRDA patients and examine effects of rhuEPO administration by 
      phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS). Seven genetically 
      confirmed FRDA patients underwent 31P MRS of the calf muscles using a 
      rest-exercise-recovery protocol before and after receiving 3000 IU of rhuEPO for 
      eight weeks. FRDA patients showed more rapid phosphocreatine (PCr) depletion and 
      increased accumulation of inorganic phosphate (Pi) during incremental exercise as 
      compared to controls. After maximal exhaustive exercise prolonged regeneration of 
      PCR and slowed decline in Pi can be seen in FRDA. PCr regeneration as hallmark of 
      mitochondrial ATP production revealed correlation to activity of complex II/III 
      of the respiratory chain and to demographic values. PCr and Pi kinetics were not 
      influenced by rhuEPO administration. Our results confirm mitochondrial 
      dysfunction and exercise intolerance due to impaired oxidative phosphorylation in 
      skeletal muscle tissue of FRDA patients. MRS did not show improved mitochondrial 
      bioenergetics after eight weeks of rhuEPO exposition in skeletal muscle tissue of 
      FRDA patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EU Clinical Trials Register2008-000040-13.

AB  - The value of human disease models, which are based on induced pluripotent stem 
      cells (iPSCs), depends on the capacity to generate specifically those cell types 
      affected by pathology. We describe a new iPSC-based model of Friedreich ataxia 
      (FRDA), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder with an intronic GAA 
      repeat expansion in the frataxin gene. As the peripheral sensory neurons are 
      particularly susceptible to neurodegeneration in FRDA, we applied a 
      development-based differentiation protocol to generate specifically these cells. 
      FRDA and control iPSC lines were efficiently differentiated toward neural crest 
      progenitors and peripheral sensory neurons. The progress of the cell lines 
      through discrete steps of in vitro differentiation was closely monitored by 
      expression levels of key markers for peripheral neural development. Since it had 
      been suggested that FRDA pathology might start early during ontogenesis, we 
      investigated frataxin expression in our development-related model. A pronounced 
      frataxin deficit was found in FRDA iPSCs and neural crest cells compared to 
      controls. Whereas we identified an upregulation of frataxin expression during 
      sensory specification for control cells, this increase was not observed for FRDA 
      peripheral sensory neurons. This early failure, aggravating frataxin deficiency 
      in a specifically vulnerable human cell population, indicates a developmental 
      component in FRDA.

TI  - High-throughput immunoassay for the biochemical diagnosis of Friedreich ataxia in 
      dried blood spots and whole blood.
PG  - 1461-9
LID - 10.1373/clinchem.2013.207472 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is caused by reduced frataxin (FXN) 
      concentrations. A clinical diagnosis is typically confirmed by DNA-based assays 
      for GAA-repeat expansions or mutations in the FXN (frataxin) gene; however, these 
      assays are not applicable to therapeutic monitoring and population screening. To 
      facilitate the diagnosis and monitoring of FRDA patients, we developed an 
      immunoassay for measuring FXN. METHODS: Antibody pairs were used to capture FXN 
      and an internal control protein, ceruloplasmin (CP), in 15 muL of whole blood (WB) 
      or one 3-mm punch of a dried blood spot (DBS). Samples were assayed on a Luminex 
      LX200 analyzer and validated according to standard criteria. RESULTS: The mean 
      recovery of FXN from WB and DBS samples was 99%. Intraassay and interassay 
      imprecision (CV) values were 4.9%-13% and 9.8%-16%, respectively. The FXN limit 
      of detection was 0.07 ng/mL, and the reportable range of concentrations was 2-200 
      ng/mL. Reference adult and pediatric FXN concentrations ranged from 15 to 82 
      ng/mL (median, 33 ng/mL) for DBS and WB. The FXN concentration range was 12-22 
      ng/mL (median, 15 ng/mL) for FRDA carriers and 1-26 ng/mL (median 5 ng/mL) for 
      FRDA patients. Measurement of the FXN/CP ratio increased the ability to 
      distinguish between patients, carriers, and the reference population. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This assay is applicable to the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring 
      of FRDA. This assay can measure FXN and the control protein CP in both WB and DBS 
      specimens with minimal sample requirements, creating the potential for 
      high-throughput population screening of FRDA.

AB  - To use optical coherence tomography (OCT) and contrast letter acuity to 
      characterize vision loss in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA). High- and low-contrast 
      letter acuity and neurological measures were assessed in 507 patients with FRDA. 
      In addition, OCT was performed on 63 FRDA patients to evaluate retinal nerve 
      fiber layer (RNFL) and macular thickness. Both OCT and acuity measures were 
      analyzed in relation to genetic severity, neurologic function, and other disease 
      features. High- and low-contrast letter acuity was significantly predicted by age 
      and GAA repeat length, and highly correlated with neurological outcomes. When 
      tested by OCT, 52.7% of eyes (n = 110) had RNFL thickness values below the fifth 
      percentile for age-matched controls. RNFL thickness was significantly lowest for 
      those with worse scores on the Friedreich ataxia rating scale (FARS), worse 
      performance measure composite Z2 scores, and lower scores for high- and 
      low-contrast acuity. In linear regression analysis, GAA repeat length and age 
      independently predicted RNFL thickness. In a subcohort of participants, 21% of 
      eyes from adult subjects (n = 29 eyes) had macular thickness values below the 
      first percentile for age-matched controls, suggesting that macular abnormalities 
      can also be present in FRDA. Low-contrast acuity and RNFL thickness capture 
      visual and neurologic function in FRDA, and reflect genetic severity and disease 
      progression independently. This suggests that such measures are useful markers of 
      neurologic progression in FRDA.

      experimental treatments in Friedreich's ataxia.
PG  - e63958
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0063958 [doi]
LID - e63958
AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich ataxia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused 
      by GAA triplet repeat expansions or point mutations in the FXN gene and, 
      ultimately, a deficiency in the levels of functional frataxin protein. 
      Heterozygous carriers of the expansion express approximately 50% of normal 
      frataxin levels yet manifest no clinical symptoms, suggesting that therapeutic 
      approaches that increase frataxin may be effective even if frataxin is raised 
      only to carrier levels. Small molecule HDAC inhibitor compounds increase frataxin 
      mRNA and protein levels, and have beneficial effects in animal models of FRDA. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To gather data supporting the use of frataxin as 
      a therapeutic biomarker of drug response we characterized the intra-individual 
      stability of frataxin over time, determined the contribution of frataxin from 
      different components of blood, compared frataxin measures in different cell 
      compartments, and demonstrated that frataxin increases are achieved in peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells. Frataxin mRNA and protein levels were stable with 
      repeated sampling over four and 15 weeks. In the 15-week study, the average CV 
      was 15.6% for protein and 18% for mRNA. Highest levels of frataxin in blood were 
      in erythrocytes. As erythrocytes are not useful for frataxin assessment in many 
      clinical trial situations, we confirmed that PBMCs and buccal swabs have frataxin 
      levels equivalent to those of whole blood. In addition, a dose-dependent increase 
      in frataxin was observed when PBMCs isolated from patient blood were treated with 
      HDACi. Finally, higher frataxin levels predicted less severe neurological 
      dysfunction and were associated with slower rates of neurological change. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data support the use of frataxin as a biomarker of 
      drug effect. Frataxin levels are stable over time and as such a 1.5 to 2-fold 
      change would be detectable over normal biological fluctuations. Additionally, our 
      data support buccal cells or PBMCs as sources for measuring frataxin protein in 
      therapeutic trials.

TI  - Radial diffusivity in the cerebellar peduncles correlates with clinical severity 
      in Friedreich ataxia.

AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a common inherited ataxia, caused by an expanded GAA 
      repeat sequence in the Frataxin (FXN) gene. The proprioceptive system, which 
      enters the cerebellum through the cerebellar peduncles, is a primary focus of 
      pathology. In this study, we investigate the relationship of clinical and genetic 
      data with diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) indices reflecting white matter 
      integrity of the cerebellar peduncles. Nine FRDA patients underwent DTI. After 
      between-subject registration using tract-based spatial statistics, a white matter 
      atlas was used for computing average values of DTI indices in the regions of 
      interest. These were the inferior, middle and superior cerebellar peduncles (ICP, 
      MCP, SCP). For Bonferroni correction, significance threshold was set to p < 
      0.0056. We found that radial diffusivity (D( perpendicular)) within the ICP significantly 
      correlated with scores on the Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS, Spearman's rho 
      = 0.883, p = 0.0016, all two-sided) and, at trend level, with number of 
      trinucleotide repeats (rho = 0.812, p = 0.008). D( perpendicular) in the SCP correlated with 
      scores on the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA, rho = 0.867, p = 
      0.0025). These findings support the role of DTI, and especially D( perpendicular), as an 
      informative biomarker in FRDA.

      ataxia: an open-label trial.
PG  - 713-20
LID - 10.1007/s12311-013-0482-y [doi]
AB  - Minimal objective evidence exists regarding management of Friedreich's ataxia 
      (FRDA). Antioxidant and recombinant human erythropoietin therapies have been 
      considered potential treatments to slow progression of FRDA in a small number of 
      studies. The primary objective of the current study was to test the efficacy, 
      safety, and tolerability of triple therapy-darbepoetin alfa, idebenone, and 
      riboflavin-in FRDA in a clinical pilot study. Patients included in this study 
      were nine females, 16 to 45 years of age (average 28 +/- 8), diagnosed with FRDA 
      with confirmed GAA repeat expansion mutations in the FXN gene and a GAA repeat 
      >/=400 on the shorter allele. Patients had a baseline score between 8 and 28.5 
      (average 20.7 +/- 8.3) on the scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia and 
      94.3 +/- 27.2 g/m(2) in left ventricular mass index (LVMI). Patients had been 
      treated with triple therapy with 150 mug darbepoetin alfa every 2 or 3 weeks, 
      10-20 mg/kg/day idebenone, and 10-15 mg/kg/day riboflavin for 32 +/- 19.4 months 
      (range of 8-56 months). Triple therapy was tolerated. Although not statistically 
      significant, improvement of ataxia was observed during the first six 4-month 
      periods of the study. Furthermore, a small decrease in disease progression during 
      the first 2 years of treatment was observed. Long-term statistically 
      nonsignificant improvement of LVMI and stability of the echocardiographic 
      parameters could be considered. Triple therapy may slow disease progression of 
      FRDA.

TI  - Heterochromatinization induced by GAA-repeat hyperexpansion in Friedreich's 
      ataxia can be reduced upon HDAC inhibition by vitamin B3.
PG  - 2662-75
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddt115 [doi]
AB  - Large intronic expansions of the triplet-repeat sequence (GAA.TTC) cause 
      transcriptional repression of the Frataxin gene (FXN) leading to Friedreich's 
      ataxia (FRDA). We previously found that GAA-triplet expansions stimulate 
      heterochromatinization in vivo in transgenic mice. We report here using 
      chromosome conformation capture (3C) coupled with high-throughput sequencing that 
      the GAA-repeat expansion in FRDA cells stimulates a higher-order structure as a 
      fragment containing the GAA-repeat expansion showed an increased interaction 
      frequency with genomic regions along the FXN locus. This is consistent with a 
      more compacted chromatin and coincided with an increase in both constitutive 
      H3K9me3 and facultative H3K27me3 heterochromatic marks in FRDA. Consistent with 
      this, DNase I accessibility in regions flanking the GAA repeats in patients was 
      decreased compared with healthy controls. Strikingly, this effect could be 
      antagonized with the class III histone deactylase (HDAC) inhibitor vitamin B3 
      (nicotinamide) which activated the silenced FXN gene in several FRDA models. 
      Examination of the FXN locus revealed a reduction of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, an 
      increased accessibility to DNase I and an induction of euchromatic H3 and H4 
      histone acetylations upon nicotinamide treatment. In addition, transcriptomic 
      analysis of nicotinamide treated and untreated FRDA primary lymphocytes revealed 
      that the expression of 67% of genes known to be dysregulated in FRDA was 
      ameliorated by the treatment. These findings show that nictotinamide can 
      up-regulate the FXN gene and reveal a potential mechanism of action for 
      nicotinamide in reactivating the epigenetically silenced FXN gene and therefore 
      support the further assessment of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi's) in FRDA and diseases 
      caused by a similar mechanism.

AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by 
      neurodegeneration and cardiomyopathy. The presence of a GAA trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in the first intron of the FXN gene results in the inhibition of gene 
      expression and an insufficiency of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. There is a 
      correlation between expansion length, the amount of residual frataxin and the 
      severity of disease. As the coding sequence is unaltered, pharmacological 
      up-regulation of FXN expression may restore frataxin to therapeutic levels. To 
      facilitate screening of compounds that modulate FXN expression in a 
      physiologically relevant manner, we established a cellular genomic reporter assay 
      consisting of a stable human cell line containing an FXN-EGFP fusion construct, 
      in which the EGFP gene is fused in-frame with the entire normal human FXN gene 
      present on a BAC clone. The cell line was used to establish a fluorometric 
      cellular assay for use in high throughput screening (HTS) procedures. A small 
      chemical library containing FDA-approved compounds and natural extracts was 
      screened and analyzed. Compound hits identified by HTS were further evaluated by 
      flow cytometry in the cellular genomic reporter assay. The effects on FXN mRNA 
      and frataxin protein levels were measured in lymphoblast and fibroblast cell 
      lines derived from individuals with FRDA and in a humanized GAA repeat expansion 
      mouse model of FRDA. Compounds that were established to increase FXN gene 
      expression and frataxin levels included several anti-cancer agents, the 
      iron-chelator deferiprone and the phytoalexin resveratrol.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a severe neurodegenerative disease caused by GAA 
      repeat expansion within the first intron of the frataxin gene. It has been 
      suggested that the repeat is responsible for the disease severity due to impaired 
      transcription thereby reducing expression of the protein. However, 
      genotype-phenotype correlation is imperfect, and the influence of other gene 
      regions of the frataxin gene is unknown. We hypothesized that FRDA patients may 
      harbor specific regulatory variants in the 3'-UTR. We sequenced the 3'-UTR region 
      of the frataxin gene in a cohort of 57 FRDA individuals and 58 controls. Seven 
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) out of 19 were polymorphic in our 
      case-control sample. These SNPs defined several haplotypes with one reaching 89% 
      of homozygosity in patients versus 24% in controls. In another cohort of 47 FRDA 
      Reunionese patients, 94% patients were found to be homozygous for this haplotype. 
      We found that this FRDA 3'-UTR conferred a 1.2-fold decrease in the expression of 
      a reporter gene versus the alternative haplotype configuration. We established 
      that differential targeting by miRNA could account for this functional 
      variability. We specifically demonstrated the involvement of miR-124 (i.e 
      hsa-mir-124-3p) in the down-regulation of FRDA-3'-UTR. Our results suggest for 
      the first time that post-transcriptional regulation of frataxin occurs through 
      the 3'-UTR and involves miRNA targeting. We propose that the involvement of 
      miRNAs in a FRDA-specific regulation of frataxin may provide a rationale to 
      increase residual levels of frataxin through miRNA-inhibitory molecules.

PG  - 971-82
LID - 10.1002/ana.23698 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative 
      disease caused in almost all cases by homozygosity for a GAA trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in the frataxin gene. Frataxin is a mitochondrial protein involved in 
      iron homeostasis. FRDA patients have a high prevalence of diabetes, the 
      pathogenesis of which is not known. We aimed to evaluate the relative 
      contribution of insulin resistance and beta-cell failure and the pathogenic 
      mechanisms involved in FRDA diabetes. METHODS: Forty-one FRDA patients, 26 
      heterozygous carriers of a GAA expansion, and 53 controls underwent oral and 
      intravenous glucose tolerance tests. beta-Cell proportion was quantified in 
      postmortem pancreas sections from 9 unrelated FRDA patients. Using an in vitro 
      disease model, we studied how frataxin deficiency affects beta-cell function and 
      survival. RESULTS: FRDA patients had increased abdominal fat and were insulin 
      resistant. This was not compensated for by increased insulin secretion, resulting 
      in a markedly reduced disposition index, indicative of pancreatic beta-cell failure. 
      Loss of glucose tolerance was driven by beta-cell dysfunction, which correlated with 
      abdominal fatness. In postmortem pancreas sections, pancreatic islets of FRDA 
      patients had a lower beta-cell content. RNA interference-mediated frataxin knockdown 
      impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and induced apoptosis in rat beta 
      cells and human islets. Frataxin deficiency sensitized beta cells to oleate-induced 
      and endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis, which could be prevented by 
      the incretins glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic 
      polypeptide. INTERPRETATION: Pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction is central to diabetes 
      development in FRDA as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction and higher 
      sensitivity to metabolic and endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced beta-cell death.

AB  - Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive, inherited neuro- and 
      cardio-degenerative disorder characterized by progressive ataxia of all four 
      limbs, dysarthria, areflexia, sensory loss, skeletal deformities, and 
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Most disease alleles have a trinucleotide repeat 
      expansion in the first intron of the FXN gene, which decreases expression of the 
      encoded protein frataxin. Frataxin is involved in iron-sulfur-cluster (ISC) 
      assembly in the mitochondrial matrix, and decreased frataxin is associated with 
      ISC-enzyme and mitochondrial dysfunction, mitochondrial iron accumulation, and 
      increased oxidative stress. To assess the role of oxidative stress in lipid 
      peroxidation in Friedreich ataxia we used the novel approach of treating 
      Friedreich ataxia cell models with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) deuterated 
      at bis-allylic sites. In ROS-driven oxidation of PUFAs, the rate-limiting step is 
      hydrogen abstraction from a bis-allylic site; isotopic reinforcement 
      (deuteration) of bis-allylic sites slows down their peroxidation. We show that 
      linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids deuterated at the peroxidation-prone bis-allylic 
      positions actively rescue oxidative-stress-challenged Friedreich ataxia cells. 
      The protective effect of the deuterated PUFAs is additive in our models with the 
      protective effect of the CoQ10 analog idebenone, which is thought to decrease the 
      production of free radicals. Moreover, the administration of deuterated PUFAs 
      resulted in decreased lipid peroxidation as measured by the fluorescence of the 
      fatty acid analog C11-BODIPY (581/591) probe. Our results are consistent with a 
      role for lipid peroxidation in Friedreich ataxia pathology, and suggest that the 
      novel approach of oral delivery of isotope-reinforced PUFAs may have therapeutic 
      potential in Friedreich ataxia and other disorders involving oxidative stress and 
      lipid peroxidation.

TI  - Missense mutations linked to friedreich ataxia have different but synergistic 
      effects on mitochondrial frataxin isoforms.
PG  - 4116-27
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M112.435263 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia is an early-onset multisystemic disease linked to a variety of 
      molecular defects in the nuclear gene FRDA. This gene normally encodes the 
      iron-binding protein frataxin (FXN), which is critical for mitochondrial iron 
      metabolism, global cellular iron homeostasis, and antioxidant protection. In most 
      Friedreich ataxia patients, a large GAA-repeat expansion is present within the 
      first intron of both FRDA alleles, that results in transcriptional silencing 
      ultimately leading to insufficient levels of FXN protein in the mitochondrial 
      matrix and probably other cellular compartments. The lack of FXN in turn impairs 
      incorporation of iron into iron-sulfur cluster and heme cofactors, causing 
      widespread enzymatic deficits and oxidative damage catalyzed by excess labile 
      iron. In a minority of patients, a typical GAA expansion is present in only one 
      FRDA allele, whereas a missense mutation is found in the other allele. Although 
      it is known that the disease course for these patients can be as severe as for 
      patients with two expanded FRDA alleles, the underlying pathophysiological 
      mechanisms are not understood. Human cells normally contain two major 
      mitochondrial isoforms of FXN (FXN(42-210) and FXN(81-210)) that have different 
      biochemical properties and functional roles. Using cell-free systems and 
      different cellular models, we show that two of the most clinically severe FXN 
      point mutations, I154F and W155R, have unique direct and indirect effects on the 
      stability, biogenesis, or catalytic activity of FXN(42-210) and FXN(81-210) under 
      physiological conditions. Our data indicate that frataxin point mutations have 
      complex biochemical effects that synergistically contribute to the 
      pathophysiology of Friedreich ataxia.

AB  - An 18-year-old lady had presented to us with insidious onset progressive gait 
      ataxia of 5-year duration. Her sister had similar complaints and type 1 diabetes 
      mellitus. Examination revealed, gait ataxia, impaired tandem gait, babinski sign 
      and severe swaying on testing for Romberg's sign. All deep tendon reflexes were 
      exaggerated. On investigations, there was no evidence for diabetes mellitus or 
      nutritional deficiencies. Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were normal. 
      Magnetic spine resonance showed marked atrophy of cervical cord with normal 
      cerebellum. The genetic testing disclosed expanded GAA repeat length on both 
      alleles of FXN gene. The GAA repeat length on both alleles was much less than 
      mean length observed in Friedreich's ataxia. This case highlights how strongly 
      the genotype influences the neurological and systemic manifestations as well as 
      severity of disease in Friedreich's ataxia.

AB  - Expanded trinucleotide repeat sequences are the cause of several inherited 
      neurodegenerative diseases. Disease pathogenesis is correlated with several 
      features of somatic instability of these sequences, including further large 
      expansions in postmitotic tissues. The presence of somatic expansions in 
      postmitotic tissues is consistent with DNA repair being a major determinant of 
      somatic instability. Indeed, proteins in the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway are 
      required for instability of the expanded (CAG.CTG)(n) sequence, likely via 
      recognition of intrastrand hairpins by MutSbeta. It is not clear if or how MMR would 
      affect instability of disease-causing expanded trinucleotide repeat sequences 
      that adopt secondary structures other than hairpins, such as the triplex/R-loop 
      forming (GAA.TTC)(n) sequence that causes Friedreich ataxia. We analyzed somatic 
      instability in transgenic mice that carry an expanded (GAA.TTC)(n) sequence in 
      the context of the human FXN locus and lack the individual MMR proteins Msh2, 
      Msh6 or Pms2. The absence of Msh2 or Msh6 resulted in a dramatic reduction in 
      somatic mutations, indicating that mammalian MMR promotes instability of the 
      (GAA.TTC)(n) sequence via MutSalpha. The absence of Pms2 resulted in increased 
      accumulation of large expansions in the nervous system (cerebellum, cerebrum, and 
      dorsal root ganglia) but not in non-neuronal tissues (heart and kidney), without 
      affecting the prevalence of contractions. Pms2 suppressed large expansions 
      specifically in tissues showing MutSalpha-dependent somatic instability, suggesting 
      that they may act on the same lesion or structure associated with the expanded 
      (GAA.TTC)(n) sequence. We conclude that Pms2 specifically suppresses large 
      expansions of a pathogenic trinucleotide repeat sequence in neuronal tissues, 
      possibly acting independently of the canonical MMR pathway.

AB  - The genetic mutation in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a hyperexpansion of the 
      triplet-repeat sequence GAA.TTC within the first intron of the FXN gene. Although 
      yeast and reporter construct models for GAA.TTC triplet-repeat expansion have 
      been reported, studies on FRDA pathogenesis and therapeutic development are 
      limited by the availability of an appropriate cell model in which to study the 
      mechanism of instability of the GAA.TTC triplet repeats in the human genome. 
      Herein, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were generated from FRDA patient 
      fibroblasts after transduction with the four transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, 
      Klf4, and c-Myc. These cells were differentiated into neurospheres and neuronal 
      precursors in vitro, providing a valuable cell model for FRDA. During propagation 
      of the iPSCs, GAA.TTC triplet repeats expanded at a rate of about two GAA.TTC 
      triplet repeats/replication. However, GAA.TTC triplet repeats were stable in FRDA 
      fibroblasts and neuronal stem cells. The mismatch repair enzymes MSH2, MSH3, and 
      MSH6, implicated in repeat instability in other triplet-repeat diseases, were 
      highly expressed in pluripotent stem cells compared with fibroblasts and neuronal 
      stem cells and occupied FXN intron 1. In addition, shRNA silencing of MSH2 and 
      MSH6 impeded GAA.TTC triplet-repeat expansion. A specific pyrrole-imidazole 
      polyamide targeting GAA.TTC triplet-repeat DNA partially blocked repeat expansion 
      by displacing MSH2 from FXN intron 1 in FRDA iPSCs. These studies suggest that in 
      FRDA, GAA.TTC triplet-repeat instability occurs in embryonic cells and involves 
      the highly active mismatch repair system.

AB  - While DNA repair has been implicated in CAG.CTG repeat expansion, its role in the 
      GAA.TTC expansion of Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is less clear. We have developed a 
      human cellular model that recapitulates the DNA repeat expansion found in FRDA 
      patient tissues. In this model, GAA.TTC repeats expand incrementally and 
      continuously. We have previously shown that the expansion rate is linked to 
      transcription within the repeats. Our working hypothesis is that structures 
      formed within the GAA.TTC repeat during transcription attract DNA repair enzymes 
      that then facilitate the expansion process. MutSbeta, a heterodimer of MSH2 and 
      MSH3, is known to have a role in CAG.CTG repeat expansion. We now show that shRNA 
      knockdown of either MSH2 or MSH3 slowed GAA.TTC expansion in our system. We 
      further characterized the role of MutSbeta in GAA.TTC expansion using a functional 
      assay in primary FRDA patient-derived fibroblasts. These fibroblasts have no 
      known propensity for instability in their native state. Ectopic expression of 
      MSH2 and MSH3 induced GAA.TTC repeat expansion in the native FXN gene. MSH2 is 
      central to mismatch repair and its absence or reduction causes a predisposition 
      to cancer. Thus, despite its essential role in GAA.TTC expansion, MSH2 is not an 
      attractive therapeutic target. The absence or reduction of MSH3 is not strongly 
      associated with cancer predisposition. Accordingly, MSH3 has been suggested as a 
      therapeutic target for CAG.CTG repeat expansion disorders. Our results suggest 
      that MSH3 may also serve as a therapeutic target to slow the expansion of GAA.TTC 
      repeats in the future.

PG  - 9369-73
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0059-12.2012 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is the most common inherited ataxia caused primarily by 
      an intronic GAA.TTC triplet repeat expansion in the frataxin (FXN) gene. FXN RNA 
      and protein levels are reduced in patients leading to progressive gait and limb 
      ataxia, sensory loss, reduced tendon reflexes, dysarthria, absent lower limb 
      reflexes, and loss of position and vibration sense. Neurological manifestations 
      ensue from primary loss of dorsal root ganglia neurons and their associated axons 
      ascending centrally in the spinal cord and peripherally in large myelinated 
      nerves. Small noncoding RNAs such as microRNAs have been shown to be dysregulated 
      in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. Here 
      we report that hsa-miR-886-3p (miR-886-3p) was increased in patient cells as well 
      as peripheral patient blood samples. Selective reduction in miR-886-3p by an 
      anti-miR led to elevation of FXN message and protein levels without associated 
      changes in histone marks at the FXN locus. Nevertheless, derepression of frataxin 
      by a histone deacetylase inhibitor leads to a decrease in miR-886-3p. These 
      results outline involvement of a small RNA, miR-886-3p in FRDA and a novel 
      therapeutic approach to this disease using an anti-miR-886-3p.

AB  - Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      mutations in the FXN gene that result in abnormally low levels of the 
      mitochondrial protein frataxin. The authors recently used a lateral flow 
      immunoassay to measure frataxin levels in a large cohort of controls, carriers, 
      and patients with the condition. The findings show that frataxin levels do not 
      appreciably change over time and correlate well with GAA(1) repeat length and age 
      of onset; thus, frataxin is a reliable and stable marker for severity of disease. 
      In this article, the authors present a patient diagnosed as having Friedreich 
      ataxia and osteosarcoma who received combined methotrexate, doxorubicin 
      (Adriamycin), and cisplatin (MAP) chemotherapy over 8 months. The authors 
      assessed the effect of treatment on frataxin levels, blood cell counts, and 
      clinical markers of cardiomyopathy. Results of the regimen and the use of MAP 
      chemotherapy for treatment of neoplasms in individuals with Friedreich ataxia are 
      discussed.

AB  - Most patients (98%) with Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) are homozygous for the GAA 
      repeat expansion in FXN. Only a few compound heterozygous patients with an 
      expanded repeat on one allele and a point mutation or an intragenic FXN deletion 
      on the other allele are described. In a minority of the patients only a 
      heterozygous pattern of the repeat expansion can be detected. Using array 
      analysis after GAA repeat expansion testing, we identified a FRDA patient who is 
      compound heterozygous for an expanded GAA repeat and a complete FXN deletion. 
      Since not only repeat expansions and point mutations, but also large 
      rearrangements can be the underlying cause of FRDA, a quantitative test should 
      also be performed in case a patient shows only one allele with an expanded GAA 
      repeat in FXN.

TI  - Interferon gamma upregulates frataxin and corrects the functional deficits in a 
      Friedreich ataxia model.
PG  - 2855-61
LID - 10.1093/hmg/dds110 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is the most common hereditary ataxia, affecting  approximately 3 in 
      100 000 individuals in Caucasian populations. It is caused by intronic GAA repeat 
      expansions that hinder the expression of the FXN gene, resulting in defective 
      levels of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Sensory neurons in dorsal root 
      ganglia (DRG) are particularly damaged by frataxin deficiency. There is no 
      specific therapy for FRDA. Here, we show that frataxin levels can be upregulated 
      by interferon gamma (IFNgamma) in a variety of cell types, including primary cells 
      derived from FRDA patients. IFNgamma appears to act largely through a transcriptional 
      mechanism on the FXN gene. Importantly, in vivo treatment with IFNgamma increases 
      frataxin expression in DRG neurons, prevents their pathological changes and 
      ameliorates the sensorimotor performance in FRDA mice. These results disclose new 
      roles for IFNgamma in cellular metabolism and have direct implications for the 
      treatment of FRDA.

TI  - Is Friedreich ataxia an epigenetic disorder?
PG  - 2
LID - 10.1186/1868-7083-4-2 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a debilitating and frequently fatal neurological 
      disorder that is recessively inherited. It belongs to the group of genetic 
      disorders known as the Repeat Expansion Diseases, in which pathology arises from 
      the deleterious consequences of the inheritance of a tandem repeat array whose 
      repeat number exceeds a critical threshold. In the case of FRDA, the repeat unit 
      is the triplet GAA*TTC and the tandem array is located in the first intron of the 
      frataxin (FXN) gene. Pathology arises because expanded alleles make lower than 
      normal levels of mature FXN mRNA and thus reduced levels of frataxin, the FXN 
      gene product. The repeats form a variety of unusual DNA structures that have the 
      potential to affect gene expression in a number of ways. For example, triplex 
      formation in vitro and in bacteria leads to the formation of persistent RNA:DNA 
      hybrids that block transcription. In addition, these repeats have been shown to 
      affect splicing in model systems. More recently, it has been shown that the 
      region flanking the repeats in the FXN gene is enriched for epigenetic marks 
      characteristic of transcriptionally repressed regions of the genome. However, 
      exactly how repeats in an intron cause the FXN mRNA deficit in FRDA has been the 
      subject of much debate. Identifying the mechanism or mechanisms responsible for 
      the FXN mRNA deficit in FRDA is important for the development of treatments for 
      this currently incurable disorder. This review discusses evidence for and against 
      different models for the repeat-mediated mRNA deficit.

TI  - Exonic deletions of FXN and early-onset Friedreich ataxia.
PG  - 912-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich ataxia (FA) is the most frequent type of autosomal 
      recessive cerebellar ataxia, occurring at a mean age of 16 years. Nearly 98% of 
      patients with FA present with homozygous GAA expansions in the FXN gene. The 
      remaining patients are compound heterozygous for an expansion and a point 
      mutation. Patients who are compound heterozygous for an exonic deletion and an 
      expansion are exquisitely rare. OBJECTIVES: To describe 6 patients affected with 
      FA due to an exonic deletion mutation (FAexdel) and to compare these 6 patients 
      with FAexdel with 46 patients consecutively diagnosed with typical FA due to 
      homozygous GAA expansion and whose small expansions were within the same range as 
      that of the expansions of the patients with FAexdel. DESIGN: Description of a 
      series. SETTING: Academic research. PATIENTS: Six patients with FAexdel and 46 
      patients with typical FA. INTERVENTION: FXN gene analysis, including assessments 
      of GAA expansion and exon sequencing and determination of exonic copy numbers 
      using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. RESULTS: We identified 6 
      patients with FA who presented with the combination of 1 GAA expansion and 1 FXN 
      exonic deletion. The mean (SD) age at onset of the disease was earlier for 
      patients with FAexdel (7 [4] years [range, 3-12 years]) than for patients with 
      typical FA (15 [5] years [range, 6-30 years]) (P = .001), and the median time to 
      confinement to wheelchair was shorter for patients with FAexdel (20 years) than 
      for patients with typical FA (28 years) (P = .002). There was no difference 
      between the mean (SD) size of the expansion for the patients with FAexdel (780 
      [256] GAA triplet repeat sequences [range, 340-1070 GAA triplet repeat 
      sequences]) and the mean (SD) size of the short expansion for the patients with 
      typical FA (634 [163] GAA triplet repeat sequences [range, 367-1000 GAA triplet 
      repeat sequences]) (P = .10). The mean disease duration before becoming 
      wheelchair bound was shorter for patients with FAexdel (9 years) than for 
      patients with typical FA (13 years), and the incidence of cardiomyopathy was 
      higher for patients with FAexdel (84%) than for patients with typical FA (68%). 
      However, these differences were not significant, probably owing to the small size 
      of the FAexdel group. The other extraneurological signs, such as scoliosis or 
      diabetes mellitus, were particularly frequently observed in the FAexdel group. 
      One patient presented at 9 years of age with severe angina and marked 
      cardiomyopathy that confined her to a wheelchair. Three patients had disabling 
      autonomic disturbances. It appears that exonic deletion significantly contributes 
      to the clinical picture of patients with FA. CONCLUSIONS: Friedreich ataxia due 
      to an exonic deletion mutation corresponds to an early onset and severe variant 
      of FA. FXN should be investigated for exonic deletion in patients with 
      early-onset FA in which only 1 GAA expansion without a point mutation is found. 
      Patients with FAexdel have to be carefully observed using cardiological, 
      orthopaedic, endocrinological, gastroenterological, and ophthalmological data. 
      Friedreich ataxia due to an exonic deletion mutation should be suspected in young 
      patients presenting with severe scoliosis.

TI  - The mismatch repair system protects against intergenerational GAA repeat 
      instability in a Friedreich ataxia mouse model.
PG  - 165-71
LID - 10.1016/j.nbd.2012.01.002 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by a dynamic GAA repeat expansion mutation within intron 1 of the FXN 
      gene. Studies of mouse models for other trinucleotide repeat (TNR) disorders have 
      revealed an important role of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins in TNR instability. 
      To explore the potential role of MMR proteins on intergenerational GAA repeat 
      instability in FRDA, we have analyzed the transmission of unstable GAA repeat 
      expansions from FXN transgenic mice which have been crossed with mice that are 
      deficient for Msh2, Msh3, Msh6 or Pms2. We find in all cases that absence of 
      parental MMR protein not only maintains transmission of GAA expansions and 
      contractions, but also increases GAA repeat mutability (expansions and/or 
      contractions) in the offspring. This indicates that Msh2, Msh3, Msh6 and Pms2 
      proteins are not the cause of intergenerational GAA expansions or contractions, 
      but act in their canonical MMR capacity to protect against GAA repeat 
      instability. We further identified differential modes of action for the four MMR 
      proteins. Thus, Msh2 and Msh3 protect against GAA repeat contractions, while Msh6 
      protects against both GAA repeat expansions and contractions, and Pms2 protects 
      against GAA repeat expansions and also promotes contractions. Furthermore, we 
      detected enhanced occupancy of Msh2 and Msh3 proteins downstream of the FXN 
      expanded GAA repeat, suggesting a model in which Msh2/3 dimers are recruited to 
      this region to repair mismatches that would otherwise produce intergenerational 
      GAA contractions. These findings reveal substantial differences in the 
      intergenerational dynamics of expanded GAA repeat sequences compared with 
      expanded CAG/CTG repeats, where Msh2 and Msh3 are thought to actively promote 
      repeat expansions.

TI  - Effects of Friedreich's ataxia GAA repeats on DNA replication in mammalian cells.
PG  - 3964-74
LID - 10.1093/nar/gks021 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a common hereditary degenerative neuro-muscular 
      disorder caused by expansions of the (GAA)n repeat in the first intron of the 
      frataxin gene. The expanded repeats from parents frequently undergo further 
      significant length changes as they are passed on to progeny. Expanded repeats 
      also show an age-dependent instability in somatic cells, albeit on a smaller 
      scale than during intergenerational transmissions. Here we studied the effects of 
      (GAA)n repeats of varying lengths and orientations on the episomal DNA 
      replication in mammalian cells. We have recently shown that the very first round 
      of the transfected DNA replication occurs in the lack of the mature chromatin, 
      does not depend on the episomal replication origin and initiates at multiple 
      single-stranded regions of plasmid DNA. We now found that expanded GAA repeats 
      severely block this first replication round post plasmid transfection, while the 
      subsequent replication cycles are only mildly affected. The fact that GAA repeats 
      affect various replication modes in a different way might shed light on their 
      differential expansions characteristic for FRDA.

TI  - A novel deletion-insertion mutation identified in exon 3 of FXN in two siblings 
      with a severe Friedreich ataxia phenotype.
PG  - 307-13
LID - 10.1007/s10048-011-0296-3 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease most 
      commonly caused by a GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in the first intron of 
      FXN, which reduces expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. 
      Approximately 98% of individuals with FRDA are homozygous for GAA expansions, 
      with the remaining 2% compound heterozygotes for a GAA expansion and a point 
      mutation within FXN. Two siblings with early onset of symptoms experienced rapid 
      loss of ambulation by 8 and 10 years. Diagnostic testing for FRDA demonstrated 
      one GAA repeat expansion of 1010 repeats and one non-expanded allele. Sequencing 
      all five exons of FXN identified a novel deletion-insertion mutation in exon 3 
      (c.371_376del6ins15), which results in a modified frataxin protein sequence at 
      amino acid positions 124-127. Specifically, the amino acid sequence changes from 
      DVSF to VHLEDT, increasing frataxin from 211 residues to 214. Using the known 
      structure of human frataxin, a theoretical 3D model of the mutant protein was 
      developed. In the event that the modified protein is expressed and stable, it is 
      predicted that the acidic interface of frataxin, known to be involved in iron 
      binding and interactions with the iron-sulphur cluster assembly factor IscU, 
      would be impaired.

TI  - Structure-function analysis of Friedreich's ataxia mutants reveals determinants 
      of frataxin binding and activation of the Fe-S assembly complex.
PG  - 7265-74
LID - 10.1021/bi200895k [doi]
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated 
      with the loss of function of the protein frataxin (FXN) that results from low FXN 
      levels due to a GAA triplet repeat expansion or, occasionally, from missense 
      mutations in the FXN gene. Here biochemical and structural properties of FXN 
      variants, including three FRDA missense mutations (N146K, Q148R, and R165C) and 
      three related mutants (N146A, Q148G, and Q153A), were determined in an effort to 
      understand the structural basis for the loss of function. In vitro assays 
      revealed that although the three FRDA missense mutations exhibited similar losses 
      of cysteine desulfurase and Fe-S cluster assembly activities, the causes for 
      these activation defects were distinct. The R165C variant exhibited a k(cat)/K(M) 
      higher than that of native FXN but weak binding to the NFS1, ISD11, and ISCU2 
      (SDU) complex, whereas the Q148R variant exhibited the lowest k(cat)/K(M) of the 
      six tested FXN variants and only a modest binding deficiency. The order of the 
      FXN binding affinities for the SDU Fe-S assembly complex was as follows: FXN > 
      Q148R > N146A > Q148G > N146K > Q153A > R165C. Four different classes of FXN 
      variants were identified on the basis of their biochemical properties. Together, 
      these structure-function studies reveal determinants for the binding and 
      allosteric activation of the Fe-S assembly complex and provide insight into how 
      FRDA missense mutations are functionally compromised.

TI  - Hyperexpansion of GAA repeats affects post-initiation steps of FXN transcription 
      in Friedreich's ataxia.
PG  - 8366-77
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkr542 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is caused by biallelic expansion of GAA repeats 
      leading to the transcriptional silencing of the frataxin (FXN) gene. The exact 
      molecular mechanism of inhibition of FXN expression is unclear. Herein, we 
      analyze the effects of hyperexpanded GAA repeats on transcription status and 
      chromatin modifications proximal and distal to the GAA repeats. Using chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR we detected significant changes in the 
      chromatin landscape in FRDA cells relative to control cells downstream of the 
      promoter, especially in the vicinity of the GAA tract. In this region, 
      hyperexpanded GAAs induced a particular constellation of histone modifications 
      typically associated with heterochromatin-like structures. Similar epigenetic 
      changes were observed in GFP reporter construct containing 560 GAA repeats. 
      Furthermore, we observed similar levels of FXN pre-mRNA at a region upstream of 
      hyperexpanded GAA repeats in FRDA and control cells, indicating similar 
      efficiency of transcription initiation. We also demonstrated that histone 
      modifications associated with hyperexpanded GAA repeats are independent of 
      initiation and progression of transcription. Our data provide strong evidence 
      that FXN deficiency in FRDA patients results from a block of transition from 
      initiation to a productive elongation of FXN transcription due to 
      heterochromatin-like structures formed in the proximity of the hyperexpanded 
      GAAs.

TI  - Mortality in Friedreich ataxia.
PG  - 46-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jns.2011.05.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although cardiac dysfunction is widely accepted as the most common 
      cause of mortality in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), no studies have evaluated this 
      since the advent of specific clinical and genetic diagnostic criteria. METHODS: 
      We performed a retrospective study of FRDA patients to determine cause of death 
      followed by a case-control analysis comparing characteristics of deceased 
      patients with living, age- and sex-matched FRDA controls. RESULTS: Causes of 
      death were cardiac dysfunction (59%), probable cardiac dysfunction (3.3%), 
      non-cardiac (27.9%) or unknown (9.8%). Compared to non-cardiac deaths, cardiac 
      deaths occurred earlier in the disease course (median 29 vs. 17years 
      respectively). Congestive heart failure and arrhythmia were common causes of 
      cardiac-related death. Compared to living, matched FRDA controls, deceased 
      patients had longer triplet repeat lengths and higher rates of arrhythmia and 
      dilated cardiomyopathy. The presence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy did not 
      differ between deceased and living patients. CONCLUSION: Cardiac dysfunction was 
      the most frequent cause of death (59%), most commonly from congestive heart 
      failure or arrhythmia. Arrhythmia and dilated cardiomyopathy were significantly 
      more common in deceased patients compared to matched FRDA controls, while in 
      contrast, the presence of cardiac hypertrophy did not differ. More research is 
      needed to establish the clinical significance of hypertrophy in FRDA.

      disease phenotype of a Friedreich ataxia mouse model.
PG  - 496-505
LID - 10.1016/j.nbd.2011.02.016 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by GAA 
      repeat expansion within the FXN gene, leading to epigenetic changes and 
      heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing that result in a frataxin protein 
      deficit. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, including pimelic 
      o-aminobenzamide compounds 106, 109 and 136, have previously been shown to 
      reverse FXN gene silencing in short-term studies of FRDA patient cells and a 
      knock-in mouse model, but the functional consequences of such therapeutic 
      intervention have thus far not been described. We have now investigated the 
      long-term therapeutic effects of 106, 109 and 136 in our GAA repeat expansion 
      mutation-containing YG8R FRDA mouse model. We show that there is no overt 
      toxicity up to 5 months of treatment and there is amelioration of the FRDA-like 
      disease phenotype. Thus, while the neurological deficits of this model are mild, 
      109 and 106 both produced an improvement of motor coordination, whereas 109 and 
      136 produced increased locomotor activity. All three compounds increased global 
      histone H3 and H4 acetylation of brain tissue, but only 109 significantly 
      increased acetylation of specific histone residues at the FXN locus. Effects on 
      FXN mRNA expression in CNS tissues were modest, but 109 significantly increased 
      frataxin protein expression in brain tissue. 109 also produced significant 
      increases in brain aconitase enzyme activity, together with reduction of neuronal 
      pathology of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Overall, these results support 
      further assessment of HDAC inhibitors for treatment of Friedreich ataxia.

PG  - 703-13
LID - 10.1007/s12015-010-9210-x [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by 
      neurodegeneration and cardiomyopathy. It is caused by a trinucleotide (GAA) 
      repeat expansion in the first intron of the FXN gene that results in reduced 
      synthesis of FXN mRNA and its protein product, frataxin. We report the generation 
      of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines derived from skin fibroblasts from 
      two FRDA patients. Each of the patient-derived iPS (FA-iPS) cell lines maintain 
      the GAA repeat expansion and the reduced FXN mRNA expression that are 
      characteristic of the patient. The FA-iPS cells are pluripotent and form 
      teratomas when injected into nude mice. We demonstrate that following in vitro 
      differentiation the FA-iPS cells give rise to the two cell types primarily 
      affected in FRDA, peripheral neurons and cardiomyocytes. The FA-iPS cell lines 
      have the potential to provide valuable models to study the cellular pathology of 
      FRDA and to develop high-throughput drug screening assays. We have previously 
      demonstrated that stable insertion of a functional human BAC containing the 
      intact FXN gene into stem cells results in the expression of frataxin protein in 
      differentiated neurons. As such, iPS cell lines derived from FRDA patients, 
      following correction of the mutated gene, could provide a useful source of 
      immunocompatible cells for transplantation therapy.

AB  - Expansion of a GAA . TTC repeat in the first intron of the frataxin (FXN) gene 
      causes an mRNA deficit that results in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA). The region 
      flanking the repeat on FRDA alleles is associated with more extensive DNA 
      methylation than is seen on normal alleles and histone modifications typical of 
      repressed genes. However, whether these changes are responsible for the mRNA 
      deficit is controversial. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and cell lines from 
      affected and unaffected individuals, we show that certain marks of active 
      chromatin are also reduced in the promoter region of the FXN gene in patient 
      cells. Thus, the promoter chromatin may be less permissive for transcription 
      initiation than it is on normal alleles. Furthermore, we show that the initiating 
      form of RNA polymerase II and histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 4, a chromatin 
      mark tightly linked to transcription initiation, are both present at lower levels 
      on FRDA alleles. In addition, a mark of transcription elongation, trimethylated 
      H3K36, shows a reduced rate of accumulation downstream of the repeat. Our data 
      thus suggest that repeat expansion reduces both transcription initiation and 
      elongation in FRDA cells. Our findings may have implications for understanding 
      the mechanism responsible for FRDA as well as for therapeutic approaches to 
      reverse the transcription deficit.

      trinucleotide repeats.
PG  - 1749-62
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkq935 [doi]
AB  - R-loops have been described at immunoglobulin class switch sequences, prokaryotic 
      and mitochondrial replication origins, and disease-associated (CAG)n and (GAA)n 
      trinucleotide repeats. The determinants of trinucleotide R-loop formation are 
      unclear. Trinucleotide repeat expansions cause diseases including DM1 (CTG)n, 
      SCA1 (CAG)n, FRAXA (CGG)n, FRAXE (CCG)n and FRDA (GAA)n. Bidirectional convergent 
      transcription across these disease repeats can occur. We find R-loops formed when 
      CTG or CGG and their complementary strands CAG or CCG were transcribed; GAA 
      transcription, but not TTC, yielded R-loops. R-loop formation was sensitive to 
      DNA supercoiling, repeat length, insensitive to repeat interruptions, and formed 
      by extension of RNA:DNA hybrids in the RNA polymerase. R-loops arose by 
      transcription in one direction followed by transcription in the opposite 
      direction, and during simultaneous convergent bidirectional transcription of the 
      same repeat forming double R-loop structures. Since each transcribed disease 
      repeat formed R-loops suggests they may have biological functions.

TI  - Friedreich's ataxia induced pluripotent stem cells model intergenerational 
      GAA...TTC triplet repeat instability.
PG  - 631-7
LID - 10.1016/j.stem.2010.09.014 [doi]
AB  - The inherited neurodegenerative disease Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is caused by 
      GAA...TTC triplet repeat hyperexpansions within the first intron of the FXN gene, 
      encoding the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Long GAA...TTC repeats cause 
      heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing and loss of frataxin in affected 
      individuals. We report the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) 
      from FRDA patient fibroblasts by transcription factor reprogramming. FXN gene 
      repression is maintained in the iPSCs, as are the global gene expression 
      signatures reflecting the human disease. GAA...TTC repeats uniquely in FXN in the 
      iPSCs exhibit repeat instability similar to patient families, where they expand 
      and/or contract with discrete changes in length between generations. The mismatch 
      repair enzyme MSH2, implicated in repeat instability in other triplet repeat 
      diseases, is highly expressed in pluripotent cells and occupies FXN intron 1, and 
      shRNA silencing of MSH2 impedes repeat expansion, providing a possible molecular 
      explanation for repeat expansion in FRDA.

TI  - A rapid, noninvasive immunoassay for frataxin: utility in assessment of 
      Friedreich ataxia.
PG  - 238-45
LID - 10.1016/j.ymgme.2010.07.001 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder 
      caused by reduced amounts of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Frataxin levels 
      in research studies are typically measured via Western blot analysis from patient 
      fibroblasts, lymphocytes, or muscle biopsies; none of these is ideal for rapid 
      detection in large scale clinical studies. Recently, a rapid, noninvasive lateral 
      flow immunoassay was developed to accurately measure picogram levels of frataxin 
      protein and shown to distinguish lymphoblastoid cells from FRDA carriers, 
      patients and controls. We expanded the immunoassay to measure frataxin directly 
      in buccal cells and whole blood from a large cohort of controls, known carriers 
      and patients typical of a clinical trial population. The assay in buccal cells 
      shared a similar degree of variability with previous studies conducted in 
      lymphoblastoid cells (~10% coefficient of variation in controls). Significant 
      differences in frataxin protein quantity were seen between the mean group values 
      of controls, carriers, and patient buccal cells (100, 50.2, and 20.9% of control, 
      respectively) and in protein extracted from whole blood (100, 75.3, and 32.2%, 
      respectively), although there was some overlap between the groups. In addition, 
      frataxin levels were inversely related to GAA repeat length and correlated 
      directly with age of onset. Subjects with one expanded GAA repeat and an 
      identified frataxin point mutation also carried frataxin levels in the disease 
      range. Some patients displaying an FRDA phenotype but carrying only a single 
      identifiable mutation had frataxin levels in the FRDA patient range. One patient 
      from this group has a novel deletion that included exons 2 and 3 of the FXN gene 
      based on multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis of the 
      FXN gene. The lateral flow immunoassay may be a useful means to noninvasively 
      assess frataxin levels repetitively with minimal discomfort in FRDA patients in 
      specific situations such as clinical trials, and as a complementary diagnostic 
      tool to aid in identification and characterization of atypical patients.

TI  - Transposon Tn7 preferentially inserts into GAA*TTC triplet repeats under 
      conditions conducive to Y*R*Y triplex formation.
PG  - e11121
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0011121 [doi]
LID - e11121
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expansion of an unstable GAA*TTC repeat in the first intron of the 
      FXN gene causes Friedreich ataxia by reducing frataxin expression. Structure 
      formation by the repeat has been implicated in both frataxin repression and 
      GAA*TTC instability. The GAA*TTC sequence is capable of adopting multiple non-B 
      DNA structures including Y*R*Y and R*R*Y triplexes. Lower pH promotes the 
      formation of Y*R*Y triplexes by GAA*TTC. Here we used the bacterial transposon 
      Tn7 as an in vitro tool to probe whether GAA*TTC repeats can attract a 
      well-characterized recombinase. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Tn7 showed a 
      pH-dependent preference for insertion into uninterrupted regions of a Friedreich 
      ataxia patient-derived repeat, inserting 48, 39 and 14 percent of the time at pH 
      7, pH 8 and pH 9, respectively. Moreover, Tn7 also showed orientation and region 
      specific insertion within the repeat at pH 7 and pH 8, but not at pH 9. In 
      contrast, transposon Tn5 showed no strong preference for or against the repeat 
      during in vitro transposition at any pH tested. Y*R*Y triplex formation was 
      reduced in predictable ways by transposon interruption of the GAA*TTC repeat. 
      However, transposon interruptions in the GAA*TTC repeats did not increase the in 
      vitro transcription efficiency of the templates. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We 
      have demonstrated that transposon Tn7 will recognize structures that form 
      spontaneously in GAA*TTC repeats and insert in a specific orientation within the 
      repeat. The conditions used for in vitro transposition span the physiologically 
      relevant range suggesting that long GAA*TTC repeats can form triplex structures 
      in vivo, attracting enzymes involved in DNA repair, recombination and chromatin 
      modification.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is the most common of the inherited ataxias and is 
      associated with GAA trinucleotide repeat expansions within the first intron of 
      the frataxin (FXN) gene. There are expanded FXN alleles from 66 to 1,700 GAA.TTC 
      repeats in FRDA patients and correlations between number of GAA repeats and 
      frataxin protein levels are assumed. Here, we present for the first time frataxin 
      protein levels as well as analysis of GAA triplet repeats in the FXN gene in a 
      population of 50 healthy Austrian people. Frataxin protein levels were measured 
      in lymphocytes from blood samples by ELISA and GAA repeats were analyzed by 
      capillary electrophoresis. Rather unexpectedly, we found a high variation of 
      frataxin protein levels among the individuals. In addition, there was no 
      correlation between frataxin levels, GAA repeats, age and sex in this group. 
      However, these findings are of great importance for better characterization of 
      the disease.

      elongation.
PG  - 120-9
LID - 10.1002/emmm.201000064 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia is a degenerative disease caused by deficiency of the protein 
      frataxin (FXN). An intronic expansion of GAA triplets in the FXN-encoding gene, 
      FXN, causes gene silencing and thus reduced FXN protein levels. Although it is 
      widely assumed that GAA repeats block transcription via the assembly of an 
      inaccessible chromatin structure marked by methylated H3K9, direct proof for this 
      is lacking. In this study, we analysed different histone modification patterns 
      along the human FXN gene in FRDA patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines. We 
      show that FXN mRNA synthesis, but not turnover rates are affected by an expanded 
      GAA repeat tract. Importantly, rather than preventing transcription initiation, 
      long GAA repeat tracts affect transcription at the elongation step and this can 
      occur independently of H3K9 methylation. Our data demonstrate that finding novel 
      strategies to overcome the transcription elongation problem may develop into 
      promising new treatments for FRDA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), the most common recessive ataxia in 
      Caucasians, is due to severely reduced levels of frataxin, a highly conserved 
      protein, that result from a large GAA triplet repeat expansion within the first 
      intron of the frataxin gene (FXN). Typical marks of heterochromatin are found 
      near the expanded GAA repeat in FRDA patient cells and mouse models. Histone 
      deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) with a pimelic diphenylamide structure and HDAC3 
      specificity can decondense the chromatin structure at the FXN gene and restore 
      frataxin levels in cells from FRDA patients and in a GAA repeat based FRDA mouse 
      model, KIKI, providing an appealing approach for FRDA therapeutics. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In an effort to further improve the 
      pharmacological profile of pimelic diphenylamide HDACIs as potential therapeutics 
      for FRDA, we synthesized additional compounds with this basic structure and 
      screened them for HDAC3 specificity. We characterized two of these compounds, 136 
      and 109, in FRDA patients' peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the KIKI mouse 
      model. We tested their ability to upregulate frataxin at a range of 
      concentrations in order to determine a minimal effective dose. We then determined 
      in both systems the duration of effect of these drugs on frataxin mRNA and 
      protein, and on total and local histone acetylation. The effects of these 
      compounds exceeded the time of direct exposure in both systems. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results support the pre-clinical development of a 
      therapeutic approach based on pimelic diphenylamide HDACIs for FRDA and provide 
      information for the design of future human trials of these drugs, suggesting an 
      intermittent administration of the drug.

LID - e1000812
AB  - The neurodegenerative disease Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is the most common 
      autosomal-recessively inherited ataxia and is caused by a GAA triplet repeat 
      expansion in the first intron of the frataxin gene. In this disease, 
      transcription of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein involved in iron homeostasis, 
      is impaired, resulting in a significant reduction in mRNA and protein levels. 
      Global gene expression analysis was performed in peripheral blood samples from 
      FRDA patients as compared to controls, which suggested altered expression 
      patterns pertaining to genotoxic stress. We then confirmed the presence of 
      genotoxic DNA damage by using a gene-specific quantitative PCR assay and 
      discovered an increase in both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage in the blood 
      of these patients (p<0.0001, respectively). Additionally, frataxin mRNA levels 
      correlated with age of onset of disease and displayed unique sets of gene 
      alterations involved in immune response, oxidative phosphorylation, and protein 
      synthesis. Many of the key pathways observed by transcription profiling were 
      downregulated, and we believe these data suggest that patients with prolonged 
      frataxin deficiency undergo a systemic survival response to chronic genotoxic 
      stress and consequent DNA damage detectable in blood. In conclusion, our results 
      yield insight into the nature and progression of FRDA, as well as possible 
      therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, the identification of potential biomarkers, 
      including the DNA damage found in peripheral blood, may have predictive value in 
      future clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Over 15 inherited diseases are caused by expansion of 
      triplet-repeats. Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) patients are homozygous for an expanded 
      GAA triplet-repeat sequence in intron 1 of the FXN gene. The expanded GAA 
      triplet-repeat results in deficiency of FXN gene transcription, which is reversed 
      via administration of histone deacetylase inhibitors indicating that 
      transcriptional silencing is at least partially due to an epigenetic abnormality. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found a severe depletion of the chromatin 
      insulator protein CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) in the 5'UTR of the FXN gene in 
      FRDA, and coincident heterochromatin formation involving the +1 nucleosome via 
      enrichment of H3K9me3 and recruitment of heterochromatin protein 1. We identified 
      FAST-1 (FXNAntisense Transcript - 1), a novel antisense transcript that overlaps 
      the CTCF binding site in the 5'UTR, which was expressed at higher levels in FRDA. 
      The reciprocal relationship of deficient FXN transcript and higher levels of 
      FAST-1 seen in FRDA was reproduced in normal cells via knockdown of CTCF. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: CTCF depletion constitutes an epigenetic switch that 
      results in increased antisense transcription, heterochromatin formation and 
      transcriptional deficiency in FRDA. These findings provide a mechanistic basis 
      for the transcriptional silencing of the FXN gene in FRDA, and broaden our 
      understanding of disease pathogenesis in triplet-repeat diseases.

AB  - Trinucleotide repeat expansion is the genetic basis for a sizeable group of 
      inherited neurological and neuromuscular disorders. Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a 
      relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by GAA.TTC repeat 
      expansion in the first intron of the FXN gene. The expanded repeat reduces FXN 
      mRNA expression and the length of the repeat tract is proportional to disease 
      severity. Somatic expansion of the GAA.TTC repeat sequence in disease-relevant 
      tissues is thought to contribute to the progression of disease severity during 
      patient aging. Previous models of GAA.TTC instability have not been able to 
      produce substantial levels of expansion within an experimentally useful time 
      frame, which has limited our understanding of the molecular basis for this 
      expansion. Here, we present a novel model for studying GAA.TTC expansion in human 
      cells. In our model system, uninterrupted GAA.TTC repeat sequences display high 
      levels of genomic instability, with an overall tendency towards progressive 
      expansion. Using this model, we characterize the relationship between repeat 
      length and expansion. We identify the interval between 88 and 176 repeats as 
      being an important length threshold where expansion rates dramatically increase. 
      We show that expansion levels are affected by both the purity and orientation of 
      the repeat tract within the genomic context. We further demonstrate that GAA.TTC 
      expansion in our model is independent of cell division. Using unique reporter 
      constructs, we identify transcription through the repeat tract as a major 
      contributor to GAA.TTC expansion. Our findings provide novel insight into the 
      mechanisms responsible for GAA.TTC expansion in human cells.

AB  - Expansion of GAA x TTC repeats in FXN gene is associated with decreased frataxin 
      production in Frederich's ataxia patients. To study this effect, we have 
      engineered a set of GAA x TTC repeats in the EcoRI site of lacZ gene of plasmid 
      pUC18 as part of the transcription template of the lacZ gene, while keeping its 
      ORF unchanged. The effects of the GAA x TTC repeats on the lacZ expression were 
      investigated in Escherichia coli JM83 and its mutants deficiency in RNA 
      processing, homologous recombination and DNA repair. We found that transcriptions 
      of the GAA strand with different sizes and organizations displayed normal 
      alpha-complementation when RNase E was functional. By contrast, transcriptions of 
      TTC repeats containing more than 13 triplets failed to support 
      alpha-complementation, showing RNase-independent but length-dependent effects of 
      TTC repeats on lacZ expression. In addition, we also found that functions of 
      SbcCD, a DNA structure specific nuclease, were needed in the RNase E-dependent 
      lacZ expression of the GAA repeats. These suggested that processing of DNA and 
      RNA is essential to the transcription of the repeats-carrying gene in vivo.

TI  - Friedreich ataxia (FA) associated with diabetes mellitus type 1 and hyperthrophic 
      cardiomyopathy.
PG  - 107-10
AB  - Progressive signs of ataxia in a eight years old girl prompted neurological 
      investigation. The girl had unstable gait with incoordination of limb movements, 
      impairment of position and vibratory senses, dysarthria, pes cavus, positive 
      Babinski sign and scoliosis. At the age of fourteen the girl was referred in a 
      comatose condition, in a severe diabetic ketoacidosis. Ataxia and hypoactive knee 
      and ankle jerks prompted the analysis of the frataxin gene (FXN; 606829). The 
      most common molecular abnormality: GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in intron 1 
      was found with + 300 GAA repeats (1490bp) (normal individuals have 5 to 30 GAA 
      repeat expansions, whereas affected individuals have from 70 to more than 1,000 
      GAA triplets). Electrocardiogram showed diffuse T wave inversion with sinus 
      bradycardia, while ultrasound revealed concentric, symmetric hypertrophy of left 
      ventricle leading to the diagnosis of hyperthrophic cardiomyopathy. At the age of 
      14 years, the patient was bound to the wheel-chair, unable to walk. Her brother 
      started to show ataxia at the age of 8 years, and subsequent analysis showed 
      hyperthrophic cardiomyopathy, too. His mutational analysis revealed the same 
      frataxin abnormality, with + 300 GAA repeats. So far, no signs of diabetes 
      occurred. The parents are heterozygous with FXN of 9 -10 GAA (490 bp). Both 
      children received a beta blocker, while the girl's diabetes mellitus was treated 
      by insulin preparations. This is a report of two siblings with Fridreich ataxia 
      and hyperthrophic cardiomyopathy. In addition, the girl developed type 1 diabetes 
      mellitus.

TI  - SCA-LSVD: a repeat-oriented locus-specific variation database for genotype to 
      phenotype correlations in spinocerebellar ataxias.
PG  - 1037-42
LID - 10.1002/humu.21006 [doi]
AB  - Repeat expansion has been implicated in 10 out of 17 candidate genes identified 
      for autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCAs)-commonly referred as 
      spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Though genetically distinct, the SCAs share a 
      large number of features that confound their clinical classification. In 
      addition, there is a difference in the prevalence and phenotypic expression of 
      ataxias between different ethnic groups. We have created a new SCA-locus-specific 
      variation database (LSVD) that aims to catalog and integrate information on SCAs 
      associated with trinucleotide repeat expansion (SCA1, SCA 2, SCA 3, SCA 6, SCA 7, 
      SCA 8, SCA 12, SCA 17, Friedreich's ataxia [FRDA], and 
      dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA]) from all over the world. The 
      database has been developed using the Leiden Open (source) Variation Database 
      (LOVD) software (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands). The 
      database houses detailed information on clinical features, such as age and 
      symptom at onset, mode of inheritance, and genotype information, pertaining to 
      the SCA patients from more than 400 families across India. All the compiled 
      genotype data conforms to the HGVS Nomenclature guidelines. This would be a very 
      useful starting point for understanding the molecular correlates of phenotypes in 
      ataxia-a multilocus disease in which related molecular mechanisms converge to 
      overlapping phenotypes.

TI  - The genetic aetiology of late-onset chronic progressive cerebellar ataxia. A 
      population-based study.
PG  - 343-8
LID - 10.1007/s00415-009-0015-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increasing number of dominant and recessive disorders have been 
      associated with late onset chronic progressive ataxia (LOCA) complicating the 
      formulation of a rational diagnostic strategy. Furthermore, there is marked 
      geographic and ethnic variation in the relative importance of these individual 
      disorders and the cause of such observed variation remains unexplained. METHODS: 
      We have systematically investigated a population-based cohort of patients with 
      chronic progressive LOCA for SCA 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 17, FXTAS and FRDA. In 
      addition we have examined repeat length polymorphism in chromosomes from a 
      genetically homogeneous and representative control population to investigate the 
      association of high-normal repeats and disease prevalence. RESULTS: A total of 
      178 patients including 55 familial cases segregating in 38 kindreds and 123 
      sporadic were investigated. Pathological expansions were identified in 11/38 
      (28.9 %) of families and in 5/123 (4.1 %) of sporadic patients. The most frequent 
      diagnoses were SCA6 (6 families and 1 sporadic patient), DRPLA (4 families) and 
      SCA8 (1 family). In addition, one elderly female patient was identified with 
      "possible FXTAS". Six (2 %) control patients were noted to have expanded SCA8 
      alleles. CONCLUSIONS: SCA6 and DRPLA were the most frequent genetic diagnoses 
      identified. Patterns of high-normal allele frequency in this UK population were 
      distinct compared to other ethnic groups but this was poorly predictive of the 
      distribution of disease in this region. The relative contribution of new mutation 
      formation and founder effects to the prevalence of familial ataxia is uncertain, 
      and further exploration of these factors will require detailed analysis of 
      disease allele haplotypes and meiotic instability of intermediate length alleles.

PG  - 489-93
LID - 10.1007/s10072-008-1026-y [doi]
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder, is 
      in most cases due to a homozygous intronic expansion resulting in the loss of 
      function of frataxin. As mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number has been decreased 
      in FRDA cells and mtDNA polymerase (POLG) is involved in the replication of 
      mtDNA, we searched a trinucleotide CAG repeat length of this enzyme. The POLG CAG 
      repeat length was determined in DNA samples extracted from 20 FRDA patients and 
      49 control subjects. Our findings showed that the distribution of the POLG CAG 
      repeat length in the patients' samples matched the distribution for control 
      samples, but we found a statistically significant inverse correlation (r=-0.81) 
      between the POLG CAG repeats and age of onset in FRDA patients. Our results 
      suggest POLG CAG repeat instability would constitute a predisposing factor that, 
      in combination with environmental risk factors, affect age of onset and disease 
      progression.

TI  - Long intronic GAA*TTC repeats induce epigenetic changes and reporter gene 
      silencing in a molecular model of Friedreich ataxia.
PG  - 6056-65
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkn604 [doi]
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is caused by hyperexpansion of GAA*TTC repeats located 
      in the first intron of the FXN gene, which inhibits transcription leading to the 
      deficiency of frataxin. The FXN gene is an excellent target for therapeutic 
      intervention since (i) 98% of patients carry the same type of mutation, (ii) the 
      mutation is intronic, thus leaving the FXN coding sequence unaffected and (iii) 
      heterozygous GAA*TTC expansion carriers with approximately 50% decrease of the 
      frataxin are asymptomatic. The discovery of therapeutic strategies for FRDA is 
      hampered by a lack of appropriate molecular models of the disease. Herein, we 
      present the development of a new cell line as a molecular model of FRDA by 
      inserting 560 GAA*TTC repeats into an intron of a GFP reporter minigene. The 
      GFP_(GAA*TTC)(560) minigene recapitulates the molecular hallmarks of the mutated 
      FXN gene, i.e. inhibition of transcription of the reporter gene, decreased levels 
      of the reporter protein and hypoacetylation and hypermethylation of histones in 
      the vicinity of the repeats. Additionally, selected histone deacetylase 
      inhibitors, known to stimulate the FXN gene expression, increase the expression 
      of the GFP_(GAA*TTC)(560) reporter. This FRDA model can be adapted to 
      high-throughput analyses in a search for new therapeutics for the disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The most frequent mutation of Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is the 
      abnormal expansion of a GAA repeat located within the first intron of FXN gene. 
      It is known that the length of GAA is directly correlated with disease severity. 
      The effect of mutation is a severe reduction of mRNA. Recently, a link among 
      aberrant CpG methylation, chromatin organisation and GAA repeat was proposed. 
      METHODS: In this study, using pyrosequencing technology, we have performed a 
      quantitative analysis of the methylation status of five CpG sites located within 
      the region upstream of GAA repeat, in 67 FRDA patients. RESULTS: We confirm 
      previous observation about differences in the methylation degree between FRDA 
      individuals and controls. We showed a direct correlation between CpG methylation 
      and triplet expansion size. Significant differences were found for each CpG 
      tested (ANOVA p<0.001). These differences were largest for CpG1 and CpG2: 84.45% 
      and 76.80%, respectively, in FRDA patients compared to 19.65% and 23.34% in the 
      controls. Most importantly, we found a strong inverse correlation between CpG2 
      methylation degree and age of onset (Spearman's rho = -0.550, p<0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: Because epigenetic changes may cause or contribute to gene silencing, 
      our data may have relevance for the therapeutic approach to FRDA. Since the 
      analysis can be performed in peripheral blood leucocytes (PBL), evaluation of the 
      methylation status of specific CpG sites in FRDA patients could be a convenient 
      biomarker.

AB  - The intronic GAA repeat expansion in the frataxin (FXN) gene causes the 
      hereditary neurodegenerative disorder Friedreich ataxia. Although it is generally 
      believed that GAA repeats block transcription elongation, direct proof in 
      eukaryotic systems is lacking. We tested in hybrid minigenes the effect of GAA 
      and TTC repeats on nascent transcription and pre-mRNA processing. Unexpectedly, 
      disease-causing GAA(100) repeats did not affect transcriptional elongation in a 
      nuclear HeLa Run On assay, nor did they affect pre-mRNA transcript abundance. 
      However, they did result in a complex defect in pre-mRNA processing. The 
      insertion of GAA but not TTC repeats downstream of reporter exons resulted in 
      their partial or complete exclusion from the mature mRNAs and in the generation 
      of a variety of aberrant splicing products. This effect of GAA repeats was 
      observed to be position and context dependent; their insertion at different 
      distances from the reporter exons had a variable effect on splice-site selection. 
      In addition, GAA repeats bind to a multitude of different splicing factors and 
      induced the accumulation of an upstream pre-mRNA splicing intermediate, which is 
      not turned over into mature mRNA. When embedded in the homologous frataxin 
      minigene system, the GAA repeats did not affect the pre-mRNA transcript abundance 
      but did significantly reduce the splicing efficiency of the first intron. These 
      data indicate an association between GAA noncoding repeats and aberrant pre-mRNA 
      processing because binding of transcribed GAA repeats to a multitude of 
      trans-acting splicing factors can interfere with normal turnover of intronic RNA 
      and thus lead to its degradation and a lower abundance of mature mRNA.

TI  - The Friedreich ataxia GAA repeat expansion mutation induces comparable epigenetic 
      changes in human and transgenic mouse brain and heart tissues.
PG  - 735-46
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is caused by a homozygous GAA repeat expansion mutation 
      within intron 1 of the FXN gene, leading to reduced expression of frataxin 
      protein. Evidence suggests that the mutation may induce epigenetic changes and 
      heterochromatin formation, thereby impeding gene transcription. In particular, 
      studies using FRDA patient blood and lymphoblastoid cell lines have detected 
      increased DNA methylation of specific CpG sites upstream of the GAA repeat and 
      histone modifications in regions flanking the GAA repeat. In this report we show 
      that such epigenetic changes are also present in FRDA patient brain, cerebellum 
      and heart tissues, the primary affected systems of the disorder. Bisulfite 
      sequence analysis of the FXN flanking GAA regions reveals a shift in the FRDA DNA 
      methylation profile, with upstream CpG sites becoming consistently 
      hypermethylated and downstream CpG sites becoming consistently hypomethylated. We 
      also identify differential DNA methylation at three specific CpG sites within the 
      FXN promoter and one CpG site within exon 1. Furthermore, we show by chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation analysis that there is overall decreased histone H3K9 
      acetylation together with increased H3K9 methylation of FRDA brain tissue. 
      Further studies of brain, cerebellum and heart tissues from our GAA repeat 
      expansion-containing FRDA YAC transgenic mice reveal comparable epigenetic 
      changes to those detected in FRDA patient tissue. We have thus developed a mouse 
      model that will be a valuable resource for future therapeutic studies targeting 
      epigenetic modifications of the FXN gene to increase frataxin expression.

TI  - Frataxin gene point mutations in Italian Friedreich ataxia patients.
PG  - 289-99
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is associated with a GAA-trinucleotide-repeat expansion 
      in the first intron of the FXN gene (9q13-21), which encodes a 210-amino-acid 
      protein named frataxin. More than 95% of patients are homozygous for 90-1,300 
      repeat expansion on both alleles. The remaining patients have been shown to be 
      compound heterozygous for a GAA expansion on one allele and a micromutation on 
      the other. The reduction of both frataxin messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein was 
      found to be proportional to the size of the smaller GAA repeat allele. We report 
      a clinical and molecular study of 12 families in which classical FRDA patients 
      were heterozygous for a GAA expansion on one allele. Sequence analysis of the FXN 
      gene allowed the identification of the second disease-causing mutation in each 
      heterozygous patient, which makes this the second largest series of FRDA compound 
      heterozygotes reported thus far. We have identified seven mutations, four of 
      which are novel. Five patients carried missense mutations, whereas eight patients 
      carried null (frameshift or nonsense) mutations. Quantitation of frataxin levels 
      in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from six compound heterozygous patients 
      showed a statistically significant correlation of residual protein levels with 
      the age at onset (r = 0.82, p < 0.05) or the GAA expansion (r = -0.76, p < 0.1). 
      In the group of patients heterozygous for a null allele, a strong (r = -0.94, p < 
      0.01) correlation was observed between the size of GAA expansion and the age at 
      onset, thus lending support to the hypothesis that the residual function of 
      frataxin in patients' cells derive exclusively from the expanded allele.

TI  - Somatic instability of the expanded GAA triplet-repeat sequence in Friedreich 
      ataxia progresses throughout life.
PG  - 1-5
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) patients are homozygous for expanded GAA triplet-repeat 
      alleles in the FXN gene. Primary neurodegeneration involving the dorsal root 
      ganglia (DRG) results in progressive ataxia. While it is known that DRG are 
      inherently sensitive to frataxin deficiency, recent observations also indicate 
      that they show age-dependent, further expansion of the GAA triplet-repeat 
      mutation. Whether somatic instability is progressive has not been systematically 
      investigated in FRDA patients. "Small-pool" PCR analysis of approximately 2300 
      individual molecules from tissues of an 18-week fetus homozygous for expanded 
      alleles revealed very low levels of instability compared with adult-derived 
      tissues (4.2% versus 30.6%, p<0.0001). Mutation load in blood samples from 
      multiple patients and carriers increased significantly with age, ranging from 
      7.5% at 18-weeks gestation to 78.7% at 49 years of age (R=0.91; p=0.0001). 
      Therefore, somatic instability in FRDA occurs mostly after early embryonic 
      development and progresses throughout life, lending further support to the role 
      of postnatal somatic instability in disease pathogenesis.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is the most common recessive ataxia, affecting 1-2 in 
      50,000 Caucasians, and there is currently no effective cure or treatment. FA 
      results from a deficiency of the mitochondrial protein frataxin brought about by 
      a repeat expansion in intron 1 of the FRDA gene. The main areas affected are the 
      central nervous system (particularly the spinocerebellar system) and cardiac 
      tissue. Therapies aimed at alleviating the neurological degeneration have proved 
      unsuccessful to date. Here, we describe the construction and delivery of high 
      capacity herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) amplicon vectors expressing the 
      entire 80 kb FRDA genomic locus, driven by the endogenous FRDA promoter and 
      including all introns and flanking regulatory sequences within a 135 kb genomic 
      DNA insert. FA patient primary fibroblasts deficient in frataxin protein and 
      exhibiting sensitivity to oxidative stress were transduced at high efficiency by 
      FRDA genomic locus vectors. Following vector transduction, expression of FRDA 
      protein by immunofluorescence was shown. Finally, functional complementation 
      studies demonstrated restoration of the wild-type cellular phenotype in response 
      to oxidative stress in transduced FA patient cells. These results suggest the 
      potential of the infectious bacterial artificial chromosome-FRDA vectors for gene 
      therapy of FA.

TI  - Progressive GAA expansions in dorsal root ganglia of Friedreich's ataxia 
      patients.
PG  - 55-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Friedreich's ataxia patients are homozygous for expanded alleles of a 
      GAA triplet-repeat sequence in the FXN gene. Patients develop progressive ataxia 
      due to primary neurodegeneration involving the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs). The 
      selective neurodegeneration is due to the sensitivity of DRGs to frataxin 
      deficiency; however, the progressive nature of the disease remains unexplained. 
      Our objective was to test whether the expanded GAA triplet-repeat sequence 
      undergoes further expansion in DRGs as a possible mechanism underlying the 
      progressive pathology seen in patients. METHODS: Small-pool polymerase chain 
      reaction analysis, a sensitive technique that allows the measurement of repeat 
      length in individual FXN genes, was used to analyze somatic instability of the 
      expanded GAA triplet-repeat sequence in multiple tissues obtained from six 
      autopsies of Friedreich's ataxia patients. RESULTS: DRGs showed a significantly 
      greater frequency of large expansions (p < 0.001) and a relative paucity of large 
      contractions compared with all other tissues. There was a significant 
      age-dependent increase in the frequency of large expansions in DRGs, which ranged 
      from 0.5% at 17 years to 13.9% at 47 years (r = 0.78; p = 0.028). INTERPRETATION: 
      Progressive pathology involving the DRGs is likely due to age-dependent 
      accumulation of large expansions of the GAA triplet-repeat sequence. Thus, 
      somatic instability of the expanded GAA triplet-repeat sequence may contribute 
      directly to disease pathogenesis and progression. Progressive repeat expansion in 
      specific tissues is a common theme in the pathogenesis of triplet-repeat 
      diseases.

TI  - Infectious delivery and expression of a 135 kb human FRDA genomic DNA locus 
      complements Friedreich's ataxia deficiency in human cells.
PG  - 248-54
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is the most common recessive ataxia, affecting 1-2 in 
      50,000 Caucasians, and there is currently no effective cure or treatment. FA 
      results from a deficiency of the mitochondrial protein frataxin brought about by 
      a repeat expansion in intron 1 of the FRDA gene. The main areas affected are the 
      central nervous system (particularly the spinocerebellar system) and cardiac 
      tissue. Therapies aimed at alleviating the neurological degeneration have proved 
      unsuccessful to date. Here, we describe the construction and delivery of high 
      capacity herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) amplicon vectors expressing the 
      entire 80 kb FRDA genomic locus, driven by the endogenous FRDA promoter and 
      including all introns and flanking regulatory sequences within a 135 kb genomic 
      DNA insert. FA patient primary fibroblasts deficient in frataxin protein and 
      exhibiting sensitivity to oxidative stress were transduced at high efficiency by 
      FRDA genomic locus vectors. Following vector transduction, expression of FRDA 
      protein by immunofluorescence was shown. Finally, functional complementation 
      studies demonstrated restoration of the wild-type cellular phenotype in response 
      to oxidative stress in transduced FA patient cells. These results suggest the 
      potential of the infectious bacterial artificial chromosome-FRDA vectors for gene 
      therapy of FA.

TI  - The GAA triplet-repeat is unstable in the context of the human FXN locus and 
      displays age-dependent expansions in cerebellum and DRG in a transgenic mouse 
      model.
PG  - 633-40
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is caused by homozygosity for FXN alleles containing an 
      expanded GAA triplet-repeat (GAA-TR) sequence. Patients have progressive 
      neurodegeneration of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and in later stages the 
      cerebellum may be involved. The expanded GAA-TR sequence is unstable in somatic 
      cells in vivo, and although the mechanism of instability remains unknown, we 
      hypothesized that age-dependent and tissue-specific somatic instability may be a 
      determinant of the progressive pathology involving DRG and cerebellum. We show 
      that transgenic mice containing the expanded GAA-TR sequence (190 or 82 triplets) 
      in the context of the human FXN locus show tissue-specific and age-dependent 
      somatic instability that is compatible with this hypothesis. Small pool PCR 
      analysis, which allows quantitative analysis of repeat instability by assaying 
      individual transgenes in vivo, showed age-dependent expansions specifically in 
      the cerebellum and DRG. The (GAA)(190) allele showed some instability by 2 
      months, progressed at about 0.3-0.4 triplets per week, resulting in a significant 
      number of expansions by 12 months. Repeat length was found to determine the age 
      of onset of somatic instability, and the rate and magnitude of mutation. Given 
      the low level of cerebellar instability seen by others in multiple transgenic 
      mice with expanded CAG/CTG repeats, our data indicate that somatic instability of 
      the GAA-TR sequence is likely mediated by unique tissue-specific factors. This 
      mouse model will serve as a useful tool to delineate the mechanism(s) of 
      disease-specific somatic instability in FRDA.

TI  - Rational selection of small molecules that increase transcription through the GAA 
      repeats found in Friedreich's ataxia.
PG  - 5399-405
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive trinucleotide repeat disease 
      with no effective therapy. Expanded GAA repeats in the first intron of the FRDA 
      gene are thought to form unusual non-B DNA conformations that decrease 
      transcription and subsequently reduce levels of the encoded protein, frataxin. 
      Frataxin plays a crucial role in iron metabolism and detoxification. To discover 
      small molecules that increase transcription through the GAA repeat region in 
      FRDA, we have made stable cell lines containing a portion of expanded intron 1 
      fused to a GFP reporter. Small molecules identified using the competition 
      dialysis method were found to increase FRDA-intron 1-reporter gene expression. 
      One of these compounds, pentamidine, increases frataxin levels in patient cells. 
      Thus our approach can be used to detect small molecules of potential therapeutic 
      value in FRDA.

TI  - GAA repeat expansion mutation mouse models of Friedreich ataxia exhibit oxidative 
      stress leading to progressive neuronal and cardiac pathology.
PG  - 580-90
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an unstable 
      GAA repeat expansion mutation within intron 1 of the FXN gene. However, the 
      origins of the GAA repeat expansion, its unstable dynamics within different cells 
      and tissues, and its effects on frataxin expression are not yet completely 
      understood. Therefore, we have chosen to generate representative FRDA mouse 
      models by using the human FXN GAA repeat expansion itself as the genetically 
      modified mutation. We have previously reported the establishment of two lines of 
      human FXN YAC transgenic mice that contain unstable GAA repeat expansions within 
      the appropriate genomic context. We now describe the generation of FRDA mouse 
      models by crossbreeding of both lines of human FXN YAC transgenic mice with 
      heterozygous Fxn knockout mice. The resultant FRDA mice that express only 
      human-derived frataxin show comparatively reduced levels of frataxin mRNA and 
      protein expression, decreased aconitase activity, and oxidative stress, leading 
      to progressive neurodegenerative and cardiac pathological phenotypes. 
      Coordination deficits are present, as measured by accelerating rotarod analysis, 
      together with a progressive decrease in locomotor activity and increase in 
      weight. Large vacuoles are detected within neurons of the dorsal root ganglia 
      (DRG), predominantly within the lumbar regions in 6-month-old mice, but spreading 
      to the cervical regions after 1 year of age. Secondary demyelination of large 
      axons is also detected within the lumbar roots of older mice. Lipofuscin 
      deposition is increased in both DRG neurons and cardiomyocytes, and iron 
      deposition is detected in cardiomyocytes after 1 year of age. These mice 
      represent the first GAA repeat expansion-based FRDA mouse models that exhibit 
      progressive FRDA-like pathology and thus will be of use in testing potential 
      therapeutic strategies, particularly GAA repeat-based strategies.

TI  - DNA sequence-specific polyamides alleviate transcription inhibition associated 
      with long GAA.TTC repeats in Friedreich's ataxia.
PG  - 11497-502
AB  - The DNA abnormality found in 98% of Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) patients is the 
      unstable hyperexpansion of a GAA.TTC triplet repeat in the first intron of the 
      frataxin gene. Expanded GAA.TTC repeats result in decreased transcription and 
      reduced levels of frataxin protein in affected individuals. Beta-alanine-linked 
      pyrrole-imidazole polyamides bind GAA.TTC tracts with high affinity and disrupt 
      the intramolecular DNA.DNA-associated region of the sticky-DNA conformation 
      formed by long GAA.TTC repeats. Fluorescent polyamide-Bodipy conjugates localize 
      in the nucleus of a lymphoid cell line derived from a FRDA patient. The synthetic 
      ligands increase transcription of the frataxin gene in cell culture, resulting in 
      increased levels of frataxin protein. DNA microarray analyses indicate that a 
      limited number of genes are significantly affected in FRDA cells. Polyamides may 
      increase transcription by altering the DNA conformation of genes harboring long 
      GAA.TTC repeats or by chromatin opening.

TI  - Sticky DNA: in vivo formation in E. coli and in vitro association of long GAA*TTC 
      tracts to generate two independent supercoiled domains.
PG  - 267-84
AB  - The expanded GAA*TTC repeat sequence associated with Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) 
      adopts non-B DNA structures, (triplexes and sticky DNA). Sticky DNA is formed in 
      plasmids by the association of two long GAA*TTC tracts at lengths that are found 
      in the sequence of the frataxin gene in patients. Most FRDA patients have 
      expanded GAA*TTC repeats (up to 1700 triplets), which inhibit the transcription 
      of the gene, thus diminishing the synthesis of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein 
      involved in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis. Negative supercoiling and MgCl(2) (or 
      MnCl(2)) are required to stabilize sticky DNA (a dumbbell-shaped structure) in 
      plasmids with a pair of repeat tracts where n> or =60 in the direct repeat 
      orientation in vitro. Since the triplet repeat sequences (TRS) were symmetrically 
      positioned in the plasmids and because a number of unique restriction sites were 
      present in the vector, studies were conducted to evaluate the influence of 
      selectively linearizing one or the other supercoiled domains created by the 
      DNA*DNA associated region, i.e. the stable complex at the pair of TRS's. The two 
      domains behave independently, thus confirming the association of the two tracts 
      and the dumbbell-shaped plasmid in our model for sticky DNA. Linking number 
      investigations were performed on a family of plasmids harboring different lengths 
      (30, 60, or 176 repeats), orientations and number of tracts (one or two) of a 
      GAA*TTC repeat in Escherichia coli to evaluate the in vivo role, if any, of 
      sticky DNA. Unexpectedly, this non-B DNA conformation elicited the formation of a 
      TRS-length dependent change in the global topology of the plasmids, indicative of 
      an apparent compression of the primary helices. Thus, linking number 
      determinations confirm that sticky DNA has an important consequence in vivo.

TI  - GAA repeat polymorphism in Turkish Friedreich's ataxia patients.
PG  - 565-74
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), the most common subtype of early onset hereditary 
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by unstable GAA tri-nucleotide expansions in the first intron of 
      FRDA gene located at 9q13-q21.1 position. Results of GAA repeat polymorphism in 
      80 Turkish SCA patients and 38 family members of 11 typical FRDA patients were 
      reported. GAA triplet repeat size ranged from approximately 7 to 34 in normal 
      alleles and from approximately 66 to 1300 in mutant alleles. Twenty six patients 
      were homozygous for GAA expansion and size of expanded alleles differed from 
      approximately 425 to 1300 repeats. Children 2 and 6 years old (showing no ataxia 
      symptoms) of one family had homozygous GAA expansions reaching approximately 925 
      repeats. All 11 families studied had at least 1 afflicted child and 9 parents and 
      2 siblings were carrier (heterozygous) with mutant alleles ranging from 66 to 850 
      repeats. Family studies confirmed the meiotic instability and stronger effect of 
      expansion in the smaller alleles on phenotype and a negative correlation between 
      GAA repeat expansion size and onset-age of the disease.

TI  - Frataxin deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction.
PG  - 87-93
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FA) is an inherited recessive disorder characterized by 
      progressive neurological disability and heart abnormalities. The Friedreich 
      ataxia gene (FRDA) encodes a small mitochondrial protein, frataxin, which is 
      produced in insufficient amounts in the disease as a consequence of a GAA triplet 
      repeat expansion in the first intron of the gene. Frataxin deficiency leads to 
      excessive free radical production, dysfunction of Fe-S center containing enzymes 
      (in particular respiratory complexes I, II and III, and aconitase), and 
      progressive iron accumulation in mitochondria. Frataxin may be a mitochondrial 
      iron-binding protein that prevents this metal from participating in Fenton 
      chemistry to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals. We investigated whether frataxin 
      deficiency may in addition interfere with signaling pathways. First, we showed 
      that exposure of FA fibroblasts to iron fails to produce the normally observed 
      increase in expression of the stress defense protein manganese superoxide 
      dismutase. This impaired induction involves a nuclear factor-kappaB-independent 
      pathway that does not require free radical signaling intermediates. We also 
      examined the role of frataxin in neuronal differentiation by using stably 
      transfected clones of P19 embryonic carcinoma cells with antisense or sense 
      frataxin constructs. We found that during retinoic acid-induced neurogenesis 
      frataxin deficiency enhances apoptosis and reduces the number of terminally 
      differentiated neuronal-like cells. The addition of the antioxidant 
      N-acetyl-cysteine only rescues cells non-committed to the neuronal lineage, 
      indicating that frataxin deficiency impairs differentiation mechanisms and 
      survival responses through different mechanisms. Both studies suggest that some 
      abnormalities in frataxin-deficient cells are related to free radical independent 
      signaling pathways.

TI  - Malaysian siblings with friedreich ataxia and chorea: a novel deletion in the 
      frataxin gene.
PG  - 383-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedrich ataxia (FRDA1) is most often the result of a homozygous GAA 
      repeat expansion in the first intron of the frataxin gene (FRDA gene). This 
      condition is seen in individuals of European, North African, Middle Eastern and 
      Indian descent and has not been reported in Southeast Asian populations. 
      Approximately 4% of FRDA1 patients are compound heterozygotes. These patients 
      have a GAA expansion on one allele and a point mutation on the other and have 
      been reported to have an atypical phenotype. OBJECTIVE: To describe a novel 
      dinucleotide deletion in the FRDA gene in two Malaysian siblings with FRDA1. 
      SETTING: Tertiary referral university hospital setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 
      previously healthy 10-year-old Malaysian boy, presented with fever, lethargy, 
      headaches, dysarthria, dysphagia, vertigo and ataxia which developed over a one 
      week period. His neurological exam revealed evidence of dysarthria and ataxia, 
      mild generalized weakness and choreoform movements of the tongue and hands. His 
      reflexes were absent and Babinski sign was present bilaterally. A nine-year-old 
      sister was found to have mild ataxia but was otherwise neurologically intact. 
      RESULTS: Molecular genetic studies demonstrated that both siblings were compound 
      heterozygotes with a GAA expansion on one allele and a novel dinucleotide 
      deletion on the other allele. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a novel dinucleotide 
      deletion in the first exon of the FRDA gene in two siblings with FRDA1. 
      Additionally this is the first report of FRDA1 occurring in a family of southeast 
      Asian descent, it demonstrates intrafamilial phenotypic variability, and confirms 
      that atypical phenotypes are associated with compound heterozygosity.

TI  - Extension of the mutation spectrum in Friedreich's ataxia: detection of an exon 
      deletion and novel missense mutations.
PG  - 979-82
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), the most common autosomal recessively inherited 
      ataxia, is due to a homozygous GAA triplet repeat expansion in the first intron 
      of the FRDA gene in about 96% of patients. Approximately 4% of FRDA patients are 
      compound heterozygotes with a GAA repeat expansion in one allele and a point 
      mutation in the coding region of the second allele. To reinvestigate the mutation 
      spectrum, we searched for mutations including exon deletions in six patients 
      heterozygous for the GAA repeat expansion and found two unknown missense 
      mutations, p.Asn146Lys and p.Leu186Arg, in trans to the expanded FRDA allele. 
      Interestingly, we detected a heterozygous 2776 bp deletion including exon 5a in 
      one of our patients. This deletion removes 50 of the 210 residues of the 
      frataxin. Furthermore, since no FRDA case with two-point mutations is known, we 
      screened eight patients with FRDA phenotype but GAA alleles within the normal 
      range but did not reveal a mutation within the FRDA gene. In addition, DNA 
      polymorphisms have been found in four out of 100 control individuals in this 
      study.

TI  - GAA repeat instability in Friedreich ataxia YAC transgenic mice.
PG  - 301-10
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is primarily caused by an unstable GAA repeat-expansion 
      mutation within intron 1 of the FRDA gene. However, the exact mechanisms leading 
      to this expansion and its consequences are not fully understood. To study the 
      dynamics of this mutation, we have generated two lines of human FRDA YAC 
      transgenic mice that contain GAA repeat expansions within the appropriate genomic 
      context. We have detected intergenerational instability and age-related somatic 
      instability in both lines, with pronounced expansions found in the cerebellum. 
      The dynamic nature of our transgenic GAA repeats is comparable with previous FRDA 
      patient somatic tissue data. However, there is a difference between our FRDA YAC 
      transgenic mice and other trinucleotide-repeat mouse models, which do not show 
      pronounced repeat instability in the cerebellum. This represents the first mouse 
      model of FRDA GAA repeat instability that will help to dissect the mechanism of 
      this repeat.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) and Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) are associated with 
      defects of respiratory-chain enzyme activities. In the respective disorders, 
      these can be identified in tissue samples from postmortem brain and also during 
      life from skeletal or cardiac muscle samples. The mitochondrial abnormalities are 
      robust and reproducible. In the case of HD, it is uncertain how these 
      mitochondrial defects fit in the pathogenetic cascade. Studies are ongoing to 
      identify whether the respiratory-chain defect present in the brain is expressed 
      in skeletal muscle at the spectrophotometric level. The presence of a 
      bioenergetic defect as identified by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) 
      suggests that in HD expression of the mutant protein can exert an influence on 
      mitochondrial function in tissues outside the central nervous system (CNS). It 
      would appear that frataxin deficiency has a direct effect on mitochondrial 
      function, either through iron-sulfur cluster construction or through the 
      generation of free radicals. The identification these bioenergetic abnormalities 
      in these neurodegenerative disorders has opened up the prospect for the 
      development of disease-modifying therapies directed to the biochemical 
      abnormalities demonstrated. 31P-MRS studies have detected a deficit of in vivo 
      oxidative phosphorylation in the skeletal muscle of FRDA and HD patients and in 
      the myocardium of FRDA patients. In both FRDA and HD patients, a relationship 
      between the triplet repeat expansion and the extent of in vivo energy metabolism 
      deficit has been shown. The total safety of MRS scans makes them an ideal tool 
      for repeated assessments to monitor disease progression as well as the effect of 
      new therapies. This chapter describes useful methods for assessment of 
      mitochondrial function in vitro and in vivo.

TI  - Molecular analysis of GAA repeats and four linked bi-allelic markers in and 
      around the frataxin gene in patients and normal populations from India.
PG  - 189-95
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), the most common type of ataxia worldwide, is an 
      autosomal recessive disease. Homozygous expansion of GAA repeats in the first 
      intron of the frataxin gene constitute the major type of mutation that causes the 
      disease. The prevalence of FRDA in diverse ethnic populations of India has not 
      been widely studied. We have studied the distribution of polymorphic GAA repeats 
      in the frataxin gene among 6 clinically diagnosed patients and 160 ethnically 
      matched normal individuals, to gather information on the prevalence of FRDA in 
      the eastern part of India. Homozygous expansion in the range of 250-730 GAA 
      repeats was detected among the patients. Among normal individuals, we observed a 
      unimodal distribution of GAA repeats, consisting of 10 different alleles ranging 
      from 7 to 16 GAA repeats, where the 9 repeat allele had maximal frequency. Only 
      5.9% of all chromosomes were found to harbour >12 GAA repeats. Haplotype analysis 
      using closely linked four bi-allelic markers in and around the frataxin gene 
      indicated that 66.7% of the expanded alleles harbour the ATCC haplotype that has 
      been reported worldwide. This haplotype was present in 53.3% of the chromosomes 
      with >12 GAA repeats, and accounted for only 3.8% of chromosomes with 7 to 12 GAA 
      repeats. We found one novel haplotype, ACCT, among the expanded alleles as well 
      as among normal individuals, though at low frequency; this haplotype may be 
      characteristic of Indian populations.

TI  - Length-dependent structure formation in Friedreich ataxia (GAA)n*(TTC)n repeats 
      at neutral pH.
PG  - 1224-31
AB  - More than 15 human genetic diseases have been associated with the expansion of 
      trinucleotide DNA repeats, which may involve the formation of non-duplex DNA 
      structures. The slipped-strand nucleation of duplex DNA within GC-rich 
      trinucleotide repeats may result in the changes of repeat length; however, such a 
      mechanism seems less likely for the AT-rich (GAA)n*(TTC)n repeats. Using 
      two-dimensional agarose gels, chemical probing and atomic force microscopy, we 
      characterized the formation of non-B-DNA structures in the Friedreich 
      ataxia-associated (GAA)n*(TTC)n repeats from the FRDA gene that were cloned with 
      flanking genomic sequences into plasmids. For the normal genomic repeat length (n 
      = 9) our data are consistent with the formation of a very stable protonated 
      intramolecular triplex (H-DNA). Its stability at pH 7.4 is likely due to the high 
      proportion of the T.A.T triads which form within the repeats as well as in the 
      immediately adjacent AT-rich sequences with a homopurine. homopyrimidine bias. At 
      the long normal repeat length (n = 23), a family of H-DNAs of slightly different 
      sizes has been detected. At the premutation repeat length (n = 42) and higher 
      negative supercoiling, the formation of a single H-DNA structure becomes less 
      favorable and the data are consistent with the formation of a bi-triplex 
      structure.

TI  - Expansion of GAA triplet repeats in the human genome: unique origin of the FRDA 
      mutation at the center of an Alu.
PG  - 373-83
AB  - Friedreich ataxia is caused by expansion of a GAA triplet repeat (GAA-TR) in the 
      FRDA gene. Normal alleles contain <30 triplets, and disease-causing expansions 
      (66-1700 triplets) arise via hyperexpansion of premutations (30-65 triplets). To 
      gain insight into GAA-TR instability we analyzed all triplet repeats in the human 
      genome. We identified 988 (GAA)(8+) repeats, 291 with >or=20 triplets, including 
      29 potential premutations (30-62 triplets). Most other triplet repeats were 
      restricted to <20 triplets. We estimated the expected frequency of (GAA)(6+) 
      repeats to be negligible, further indicating that GAA-TRs have undergone 
      significant expansion. Eighty-nine percent of (GAA)(8+) sequences map within G/A 
      islands, and 58% map within the poly(A) tails of Alu elements. Only two other 
      (GAA)(8+) sequences shared the central Alu location seen at the FRDA locus. One 
      showed allelic variation, including expansions analogous to short Friedreich 
      ataxia mutations. Our data demonstrate that GAA-TRs have expanded throughout 
      primate evolution with the generation of potential premutation alleles at 
      multiple loci.

TI  - Upregulation of expression from the FRDA genomic locus for the therapy of 
      Friedreich ataxia.
PG  - 72-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich ataxia is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by reduced expression of frataxin as a result of a GAA repeat expansion in 
      the first intron of the FRDA gene. We report here the development of a sensitive 
      cellular assay for frataxin expression from the intact FRDA locus that should 
      facilitate the identification of potentially therapeutic pharmacological agents 
      to treat Friedreich ataxia. METHODS: PAC and BAC clones containing the entire 
      human FRDA functional genomic sequence were identified and shown to express FRDA 
      mRNA. The GET Recombination system was used to insert cassettes consisting of the 
      gene encoding EGFP linked to a kanamycin/neomycin resistance determinant into a 
      BAC clone containing the entire FRDA gene and surrounding regions. RESULTS: Two 
      in-frame fusions between the FRDA gene and a gene coding for enhanced green 
      fluorescent protein (EGFP) were constructed. One fusion is within exon 2 of the 
      FRDA gene. The other is at the end of exon 5a, containing the entire frataxin 
      protein fused to EGFP. Both constructs were shown to drive the expression of EGFP 
      from the regulatory elements of the FRDA locus, with the frataxin-EGFP fusion 
      proteins targeted to the mitochondria. Stable cell lines containing the EGFP 
      fusion in exon 5a were produced. Enhancement of FRDA gene expression by hemin and 
      butyric acid was demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: Expression studies with FRDA-EGFP 
      fusion constructs will facilitate delineation of regulatory elements determining 
      the tissue and developmental specificity of FRDA gene expression. These 
      constructs should also facilitate screening for pharmacological compounds that 
      can modulate the expression of the FRDA gene in a clinically relevant manner.

TI  - Friedreich's ataxia with chorea and myoclonus caused by a compound heterozygosity 
      for a novel deletion and the trinucleotide GAA expansion.
PG  - 585-9
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is the most common hereditary ataxia, affecting about 
      1 in 50,000 individuals. It is caused by mutations in the frataxin gene; 98% of 
      cases have homozygous expansions of a GAA trinucleotide in intron 1 of the 
      frataxin gene. The remaining 2% of patients are compound heterozygotes, who have 
      a GAA repeat expansion in one allele and a point mutation in the other allele. 
      FRDA patients with point mutation have been suggested to have atypical clinical 
      features. We present a case of compound heterozygotes in a FRDA patient who has a 
      deletion of one T in the start codon (ATG) of the frataxin gene and a GAA repeat 
      expansion in the other allele. The patient presented with chorea and subsequently 
      developed FRDA symptoms. The disease in this case is the result of both a failure 
      of initiation of translation and the effect of the expansion. This novel mutation 
      extends the range of point mutations seen in FRDA patients, and also broadens the 
      spectrum of FRDA genotype associated with chorea.

TI  - Trinucleotide repeats in 202 families with ataxia: a small expanded (CAG)n allele 
      at the SCA17 locus.
PG  - 623-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ten neurodegenerative disorders characterized by spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) are known to be caused by trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansions. 
      However, in some instances the molecular diagnosis is considered indeterminate 
      because of the overlap between normal and affected allele ranges. In addition, 
      the mechanism that generates expanded alleles is not completely understood. 
      OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical and molecular characteristics of a large group 
      of Portuguese and Brazilian families with ataxia to improve knowledge of the 
      molecular diagnosis of SCA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have (1) assessed repeat 
      sizes at all known TNR loci implicated in SCA; (2) determined frequency 
      distributions of normal alleles and expansions; and (3) looked at 
      genotype-phenotype correlations in 202 unrelated Portuguese and Brazilian 
      patients with SCA. Molecular analysis of TNR expansions was performed using 
      polymerase chain reaction amplification. RESULTS: Patients from 110 unrelated 
      families with SCA showed TNR expansions at 1 of the loci studied. Dominantly 
      transmitted cases had (CAG)(n) expansions at the Machado-Joseph disease gene 
      (MJD1) (63%), at SCA2 (3%), the gene for dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy 
      (DRPLA) (2%), SCA6 (1%), or SCA7 (1%) loci, or (CTG)(n) expansions at the SCA8 
      (2%) gene, whereas (GAA)(n) expansions in the Freidreich ataxia gene (FRDA) were 
      found in 64% of families with recessive ataxia. Isolated patients also had TNR 
      expansions at the MJD1 (6%), SCA8 (6%), or FRDA (8%) genes; in addition, an 
      expanded allele at the TATA-binding protein gene (TBP), with 43 CAGs, was present 
      in a patient with ataxia and mental deterioration. Associations between 
      frequencies of SCA2 and SCA6 and a frequency of large normal alleles were found 
      in Portuguese and Brazilian individuals, respectively. Interestingly, no 
      association between the frequencies of DRPLA and large normal alleles was found 
      in the Portuguese group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that (1) a significant 
      number of isolated cases of ataxia are due to TNR expansions; (2) expanded DRPLA 
      alleles in Portuguese families may have evolved from an ancestral haplotype; and 
      (3) small (CAG)(n) expansions at the TBP gene may cause SCA17.

TI  - Intrafamilial phenotypic variability in Friedreich ataxia associated with a G130V 
      mutation in the FRDA gene.
PG  - 296-300
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most patients with Friedreich ataxia (FA) have a GAA trinucleotide 
      repeat expansion in intron 1 of the FA gene (FRDA) on both arms of chromosome 9. 
      However, some patients are compound heterozygotes and harbor a GAA expansion on 
      one allele and a point mutation on the other. Compound heterozygous patients with 
      FA who have a GAA expansion and a G130V mutation have been reported to have an 
      atypical phenotype with a slow disease progression, minimal or no ataxia, or gait 
      spasticity. OBJECTIVE: To describe intrafamilial phenotypic variability in a GAA 
      expansion/G130V mutation compound heterozygous family with FA. SETTING: Tertiary 
      referral university hospital setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 34-year-old man 
      presented to our hospital with a 24-year history of stiff legs and mild 
      unsteadiness of gait. Clinical examination showed a spastic paraparesis with 
      normal to pathologically brisk deep tendon reflexes and mild left upper limb 
      ataxia. His 27-year-old sister presented with a slowly progressive early-onset 
      ataxic syndrome. She had ataxia of gait, mild to severe limb ataxia, and reduced 
      or absent deep tendon reflexes, but no evidence of spasticity on examination. 
      RESULTS: Neurophysiologic investigations showed evidence of a sensory axonal 
      neuropathy, and molecular genetic analysis showed that both siblings were 
      compound heterozygotes with a GAA expansion and a G130V mutation. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This report confirms that compound heterozygous patients with FA who have a GAA 
      expansion and a G130V mutation may present with an ataxic phenotype and that 
      intrafamilial phenotypic variability in these pedigrees can occur. It also 
      emphasizes the importance of performing molecular genetic analysis for the GAA 
      trinucleotide expansion in patients presenting with a spastic paraparesis of 
      undetermined etiology, especially when there is neurophysiologic evidence of a 
      sensory axonal neuropathy.

TI  - Friedreich ataxia with minimal GAA expansion presenting as adult-onset spastic 
      ataxia.
PG  - 75-82
AB  - Around a quarter of Friedreich ataxia (FA) patients, despite being homozygous for 
      GAA expansion within the FRDA gene, show atypical presentations. Our aim is to 
      describe the case of three brothers with long-term follow-up suffering from late 
      onset FA manifested with spastic ataxia. The three patients belong to a family 
      with occipital dysplasia (OD) and Chiari I malformation previously reported by 
      us. We have carried out serial examinations since 1977. Electrophysiological and 
      neuroimaging studies, and molecular genetic analyses of hereditary ataxias are 
      available in all three patients. Onset of symptoms occurred between 25 and 35 
      years. The clinical picture consisted of progressive spastic gait, truncal and 
      limb ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus, hyperreflexia with knee and ankle clonus and 
      extensor plantar response, and mild hypopallesthesia. Ages at present vary 
      between 50 and 59. One patient is wheelchair-bound but the other two are able to 
      walk with support. Leaving OD aside, skeletal anomalies are not prominent. All 
      three patients showed cardiomyopathy. MR imaging revealed atrophy of the 
      cerebellum and spinal cord. Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities were 
      normal. Central conduction time of both motor and sensory pathways was delayed or 
      unobtainable. All three patients were homozygous for the GAA expansion, the 
      smaller expanded allele ranging between 131 and 156 repeats. Four heterozygotic 
      carriers were detected among non-ataxic relatives including one with OD; 
      furthermore, an asymptomatic OD patient showed normal genotype. We conclude that 
      adult onset spastic ataxia is a distinctive FA phenotype associated with minimal 
      GAA expansion. This phenotype represents a new cause of selective distal 
      degeneration of central sensory axons. The present concurrence of OD and FA 
      reflects coincidental cosegregation of two different inherited disorders.

TI  - Sequence variation in GAA repeat expansions may cause differential phenotype 
      display in Friedreich's ataxia.
PG  - 1153-8
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia, the most common autosomal recessive inherited ataxia, is 
      characterized by progressive gait and limb ataxia. Friedreich's ataxia is known 
      for its occurrence within the first or second decade of life and is associated 
      with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and in some cases with diabetes. Genetically, 
      it is identified by the expression of an unstable trinucleotide GAA repeat 
      expansion located in the first intron of the X25 gene on chromosome 9. Two 
      brothers with very late adult-onset ataxia, and their unaffected sister, were 
      examined for the clinical presentation of FA and for the presence of the mutated 
      FA gene. The relationship of the expanded gene sequence to the severity of 
      disease and age of onset were evaluated. Clinical examination revealed that the 
      two brothers had mild ataxia and proprioceptive loss, with age of onset between 
      60 and 70 years of age. DNA from peripheral blood nucleated cells demonstrated a 
      small homozygous expansion, with approximately 120-130 GAA repeats in the X25 
      gene in both patients. The expanded repeats were interrupted either with GAAGAG, 
      GAAGGA, or GAAGAAAA sequences. The unaffected sister carried a normal FA genotype 
      with 8-uninterrupted GAA repeat, observed by sequence analysis. In addition, the 
      levels of FA gene transcript in both brothers were relatively lower than that in 
      the unaffected sister. No detectable cardiomyopathy or diabetes was observed. 
      Phenotypic diversity of FA is increasingly expanding. The age of onset and the 
      structure of GAA repeat expansion plays an important role in determining the 
      clinical features and the differential diagnosis of FA. The confirmation of the 
      FA gene mutation in the atypical case, broadens the clinical spectrum of FA, and 
      supports the idea that patients with even a mild form of ataxia of late adult 
      onset should be considered for molecular testing.

TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of the Friedreich ataxia GAA trinucleotide repeat.
PG  - 232-8
AB  - Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder associated 
      with a GAA repeat expansion in the first intron of the gene (FRDA) encoding a 
      novel, highly conserved, 210 amino acid protein known as frataxin. Normal 
      variation in repeat size was determined by analysis of more than 600 DNA samples 
      from seven human populations. This analysis showed that the most frequent allele 
      had nine GAA repeats, and no alleles with fewer than five GAA repeats were found. 
      The European and Syrian populations had the highest percentage of alleles with 10 
      or more GAA repeats, while the Papua New Guinea population did not have any 
      alleles carrying more than 10 GAA repeats. The distributions of repeat sizes in 
      the European, Syrian, and African American populations were significantly 
      different from those in the Asian and Papua New Guinea populations (p < 0.001). 
      The GAA repeat size was also determined in five nonhuman primates. Samples from 
      10 chimpanzees, 3 orangutans, 1 gorilla, 1 rhesus macaque, 1 mangabey, and 1 
      tamarin were analyzed. Among those primates belonging to the Pongidae family, the 
      chimpanzees were found to carry three or four GAA repeats, the orangutans had 
      four or five GAA repeats, and the gorilla carried three GAA repeats. In primates 
      belonging to the Cercopithecidae family, three GAA repeats were found in the 
      mangabey and two in the rhesus macaque. However, an AluY subfamily member 
      inserted in the poly(A) tract preceding the GAA repeat region in the rhesus 
      macaque, making the amplified sequence approximately 300 bp longer. The GAA 
      repeat was also found in the tamarin, suggesting that it arose at least 40 
      million years ago and remained relatively small throughout the majority of 
      primate evolution, with a punctuated expansion in the human genome.

TI  - Sticky DNA, a self-associated complex formed at long GAA*TTC repeats in intron 1 
      of the frataxin gene, inhibits transcription.
PG  - 27171-7
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by the expansion of GAA.TTC repeats in the first intron of the frataxin 
      (X25) gene. FRDA patients carrying two expanded GAA.TTC repeats show very low 
      levels of mature frataxin mRNA and protein. A novel type of unusual DNA 
      structure, sticky DNA, was previously found in the expanded GAA.TTC repeats from 
      FRDA patients. To evaluate the effect of sticky DNA on transcription, in vitro 
      transcription studies of (GAA.TTC)(n) repeats (where n = 9-150) were carried out 
      using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase. When a gel-isolated sticky DNA template was 
      transcribed, the amount of full-length RNA synthesized was significantly reduced 
      compared with the transcription of the linear template. Surprisingly, 
      transcriptional inhibition was observed not only for the sticky DNA template but 
      also another DNA molecule used as an internal control in an 
      orientation-independent manner. The molecular mechanism of transcriptional 
      inhibition by sticky DNA was a sequestration of the RNA polymerases by direct 
      binding to the complex DNA structure. Moreover, plasmids containing the 
      (GAAGGA.TCCTTC)(65) repeat, which does not form sticky DNA, did not inhibit in 
      vitro transcription, as expected. These results suggest that the role of sticky 
      DNA in FRDA may be the sequestration of transcription factors.

TI  - GGA*TCC-interrupted triplets in long GAA*TTC repeats inhibit the formation of 
      triplex and sticky DNA structures, alleviate transcription inhibition, and reduce 
      genetic instabilities.
PG  - 27178-87
AB  - Large expansions of GAA.TTC repeats in the first intron of the frataxin (X25) 
      gene are the principal mutation responsible for Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). 
      Sticky DNA, based on R.R.Y triplexes, was found at the expanded GAA.TTC repeats 
      from FRDA patients. The (GAAGGA.TCCTTC)(65) repeat occurs in the same frataxin 
      locus but is nonpathogenic and does not form sticky DNA. To elucidate the 
      behavior of sticky DNA, we introduced various extents of GGA.TCC interruptions 
      into the long GAA.TTC repeat. More than 20% of GGA.TCC interruptions abolished 
      the formation of sticky DNA. However, the GAA.TTC repeats with less than 11% of 
      GGA.TCC interruptions formed triplexes and/or sticky DNA similar to the 
      uninterrupted repeat sequence. These triplexes showed different P1 nuclease 
      sensitivities, and the GGA.TCC interruptions were slightly more sensitive than 
      the surrounding GAA.TTC repeats. Furthermore, genetic instability investigations 
      in Escherichia coli revealed that a small number (4%) of interruptions 
      substantially stabilized the long GAA.TTC tracts. Furthermore, the greater the 
      extent of interruptions of the GAA.TTC repeats, the less inhibition of in vitro 
      transcription was observed, as expected, based on the capacity of interruptions 
      to inhibit the formation of sticky DNA. We propose that the interruptions 
      introduce base mismatches into the R.R.Y triplex, which explains the observed 
      chemical and biological properties.

TI  - Limited somatic mosaicism for Friedreich's ataxia GAA triplet repeat expansions 
      identified by small pool PCR in blood leukocytes.
PG  - 188-92
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), the most common inherited ataxia, is 
      associated with an unstable expansion of GAA repeats in the first intron of the 
      frataxin gene on chromosome 9. We investigated the mosaicism of expanded alleles 
      to elucidate the basis for genotype phenotype correlations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      We studied the instability of the GAA repeat in blood leukocytes from 45 
      individuals including 20 FRDA patients and 20 non-affected controls using small 
      pool PCR combined with Southern blotting and hybridization. RESULTS: Expanded GAA 
      repeats could be resolved into distinct alleles showing differences in length up 
      to 1,000 triplets for an individual genome. We found a significant correlation 
      between the size of the largest allele and the range of mosaicism. CONCLUSION: 
      The somatic mosaicism for expanded repeats observed in FRDA patients rendered the 
      precise measurement of allele sizes more difficult and may influence the results 
      of studies correlating the clinical spectrum with the genotype. Following, a 
      confidential prediction of the prognosis deduced from the repeat length is hardly 
      possible for an individual FRDA patient.

TI  - Molecular analysis of Friedreich's ataxia locus in the Indian population.
PG  - 227-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of GAA repeats in the frataxin 
      gene. We have carried out the first molecular analysis at the Friedreich's ataxia 
      locus in the Indian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three families clinically 
      diagnosed for Friedreich's ataxia were analyzed for GAA expansion at the FRDA 
      locus. The distribution of GAA repeats was also estimated in normal individuals 
      of Indian origin. RESULTS: All patients clinically diagnosed for Friedreich's 
      ataxia were found to be homozygous for GAA repeat expansion. The GAA repeat in 
      the normal population show a bimodal distribution with 94% of alleles ranging 
      from 7-16 repeats. CONCLUSION: Indian patients with expansion at the FRDA locus 
      showed typical clinical features of Friedreich's ataxia. The low frequency of 
      large normal alleles (6%) could indicate that the prevalence of this disease in 
      the Indian population is likely to be low.

TI  - Different phenotypes of Friedreich's ataxia within one 'pseudo-dominant' 
      genealogy: relationships between trinucleotide (GAA) repeat lengths and clinical 
      features.
PG  - 535-40
AB  - We examined a large Turkmen family with 'pseudo-dominant' inheritance of 
      Friedreich's ataxia resulting from consanguineous marriage of a Friedreich's 
      ataxia patient to a heterozygote carrying an ancestral mutated allele. Two 
      distinct phenotypes of the disease co-segregated within this genealogy. Two 
      brothers from the younger generation exhibited 'classical' Friedreich's ataxia 
      with onset of symptoms before 10 years and a rapidly progressive course. In 
      contrast, three patients (two sisters from the younger generation and their 
      father) had a more benign phenotype of late-onset Friedreich's ataxia with the 
      onset at 26, 45 and 48 years and slow progression over decades. The patients with 
      'classical' Friedreich's ataxia were homozygous for a common ancestral expanded 
      allele of the X25 gene containing 700-800 GAA repeats, while the patients with 
      late-onset Friedreich's ataxia had two different mutated alleles, the shorter 
      250-repeat expansion of paternal origin and the longer 700-repeat expansion of 
      maternal origin. One may conclude that clinical variability of Friedreich's 
      ataxia in our patients is accounted for predominantly by a modifying effect of 
      one of the two (shorter or longer) expanded alleles inherited from their affected 
      father. Our observation clearly demonstrates the significance of variable-sized 
      alleles for the phenotypic expression of the disease.

TI  - Echocardiographic characterization of cardiomyopathy in Friedreich's ataxia with 
      tissue Doppler echocardiographically derived myocardial velocity gradients.
PG  - 1276-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiographically derived 
      myocardial velocity gradients (MVGs) were used to characterize the myocardium in 
      patients with Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), and the relationship between MVGs and 
      the mutation in the FRDA gene, a GAA triplet repeat expansion, was investigated. 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 29 patients with FRDA (10 men, mean age 31+/-9 
      years) who were homozygous for the GAA expansion in the FRDA gene and were 
      without cardiac symptoms. A comparison was made with a group of 30 age-matched 
      control subjects. In patients with FRDA, interventricular septal thickness 
      (1.17+/-0.26 versus 0.85+/-0.13 cm, P:<0.005), posterior left ventricular wall 
      thickness (1.00+/-0.24 versus 0.88+/-0.15 cm, P:<0.01), and left atrial diameter 
      (3.3+/-0.5 versus 2.9+/-0.3 cm, P:=0.01) were increased compared with control 
      subjects. MVGs were reduced in FRDA during systole (3.1+/-1.2 versus 4.5+/-0.5 
      s(-1), P:<0.0001) and in early diastole (4.9+/-2.7 versus 8.8+/-1.8 s(-1), 
      P:<0.0001) but increased in late diastole (2.0+/-1. 3 versus 1.1+/-0.9 s(-1), 
      P:<0.01). The strongest relationship was seen between age-corrected early 
      diastolic MVGs and the GAA expansion in the smaller allele of the FRDA gene 
      (r=-0.68, P:<0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: MVGs offer a means of further characterizing 
      the myocardial abnormalities in patients with FRDA. Early diastolic MVGs appear 
      to relate most closely to the genetic abnormality and the consequential reduction 
      in frataxin protein.

TI  - Genotype and phenotype analysis of Friedreich's ataxia compound heterozygous 
      patients.
PG  - 86-92
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia is caused by mutations in the FRDA gene that encodes 
      frataxin, a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein. Most patients are homozygous 
      for the expansion of a GAA triplet repeat within the FRDA gene, but a few 
      patients show compound heterozygosity for a point mutation and the GAA-repeat 
      expansion. We analyzed DNA samples from a cohort of 241 patients with autosomal 
      recessive or isolated spinocerebellar ataxia for the GAA triplet expansion. 
      Patients heterozygous for the GAA expansion were screened for point mutations 
      within the FRDA coding region. Molecular analyses included the single-strand 
      conformation polymorphism analysis, direct sequencing, and linkage analysis with 
      FRDA locus flanking markers. Seven compound heterozygous patients were 
      identified. In four patients, a point mutation that predicts a truncated frataxin 
      was detected. Three of them associated classic early-onset Friedreich's ataxia 
      with an expanded GAA allele greater than 800 repeats. The other patient 
      associated late-onset disease at the age of 29 years with a 350-GAA repeat 
      expansion. In two patients manifesting the classical phenotype, no changes were 
      observed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Linkage 
      analysis in a family with two children affected by an ataxic syndrome, one of 
      them showing heterozygosity for the GAA expansion, confirmed no linkage to the 
      FRDA locus. Most point mutations in compound heterozygous Friedreich's ataxia 
      patients are null mutations. In the present patients, clinical phenotype seems to 
      be related to the GAA repeat number in the expanded allele. Complete molecular 
      definition in these patients is required for clinical diagnosis and genetic 
      counseling.

TI  - Heterozygous expansion of the GAA tract of the X25/frataxin gene is associated 
      with insulin resistance in humans.
PG  - 1604-7
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease that has been 
      attributed to a GAA triplet repeat expansion in the first intron of the 
      X25/frataxin gene. Impaired glucose tolerance is present in up to 39% of FA 
      patients, and clinically apparent diabetes is seen in approximately 18% of the 
      affected individuals. Subjects carrying the X25/frataxin GAA repeat in a 
      heterozygous state do not develop FA and, therefore, represent an ideal model to 
      study the underlying metabolic defects that contribute to the diabetes associated 
      with this disorder. In the present study, we have compared 11 first-degree 
      relatives of FA patients (i.e., parents or heterozygous siblings of FA patients) 
      with matched normal control subjects to study the parameters of glucose 
      metabolism. An oral glucose tolerance test revealed diabetes in one of the 
      heterozygous subjects who was excluded from further analyses. Using an 
      octreotide-based quantification of insulin sensitivity, 8 of the remaining 10 
      study subjects showed pronounced insulin resistance, reflecting a significant 
      difference from the control group (P = 0.001). In conclusion, a heterozygous 
      expansion of the X25/frataxin GAA repeat in healthy individuals is associated 
      with insulin resistance and might be considered a genetic co-factor in the 
      pathogenesis of mitochondrial subtypes of diabetes.

TI  - Typical Friedreich's ataxia without GAA expansions and GAA expansion without 
      typical Friedreich's ataxia.
PG  - 346-55
AB  - We clinically assessed and performed polymerase chain reaction analysis for the 
      GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in 103 patients from 73 families in Ireland, 
      with a prior clinical diagnosis of Friedreich's ataxia (FA) or an unclassified 
      progressive ataxic syndrome. The patients were classified as "typical" or 
      "atypical" FA according to Harding's mandatory clinical diagnostic criteria. All 
      patients underwent blood glucose analysis, and electrocardiography and 
      echocardiography was performed in 99 and 101 patients, respectively. Mutation 
      screening for expanded CAG trinucleotide repeats, associated with spinocerebellar 
      ataxia (SCA) 1, 2, 3 and 6 was performed in 86 patients overall, including all 
      GAA negative patients. Forty-nine of 56 typical patients and 13 of 47 atypical 
      patients were either homozygous or heterozygous for the GAA expansion. Seven 
      patients with a typical FA phenotype were negative for the GAA expansion. 
      Although one of these patients had vitamin E deficiency, and two had raised 
      alpha-fetoprotein levels, three other GAA negative patients with a typical FA 
      phenotype had no other identifiable cause for their ataxia, once again raising 
      the possibility of locus heterogeneity in FA. It is also possible that these 
      patients have two point mutations in the X25 gene, or that they have another 
      ataxic syndrome mimicking the FA phenotype. Two families who were homozygous for 
      the GAA expansion exhibited intrafamilial phenotypic variability. Only one GAA 
      negative patient had the SCA 3 mutation, and this was the only patient in the 
      study with a possible autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. In the homozygous 
      GAA population typical patients had significantly more repeats on the smaller 
      allele than atypical patients, and there was an inverse relationship between the 
      number of repeats on the smaller allele and the age at presentation. There was 
      also an inverse relationship between the repeat size on both the larger and the 
      smaller of the two alleles and the age at becoming wheelchair bound. There was no 
      significant relationship between repeat size and the other indices of disease 
      severity, including the presence or absence of diabetes or cardiomyopathy. This 
      is the first large study of an Irish population with progressive ataxia that has 
      shown a similar phenotype/genotype relationship to studies of FA in other 
      European and non-European populations. The relatively low sensitivity and 
      specificity of Harding's clinical diagnostic criteria must be appreciated when 
      clinically assessing patients with a progressive ataxic syndrome. Although 
      molecular genetic analysis now plays an essential role in diagnosis and 
      classification, patients with a typical FA phenotype without any identifiable 
      cause for their ataxia exist.

TI  - The correlation of clinical phenotype in Friedreich ataxia with the site of point 
      mutations in the FRDA gene.
PG  - 253-7
AB  - Most cases of Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) are due to expansions of a GAA 
      trinucleotide repeat sequence in the FRDA gene coding for frataxin, a protein of 
      poorly understood function which may regulate mitochondrial iron transport. 
      However, between 1% and 5% of mutations are single base changes in the sequence 
      of the FRDA gene, causing missense, nonsense, or splicing mutations. We describe 
      three new mutations, IVS4nt2 (T to G), R165C, and L182F, which occur in patients 
      in association with GAA expansions. These cases, and a further five reported 
      cases of point mutations causing FRDA, demonstrate that splicing, nonsense, or 
      initiation codon mutations (which cause a complete absence of functional 
      frataxin) are associated with a severe phenotype. Missense mutations, even in 
      highly evolutionally conserved amino acids, may cause a mild or severe phenotype.

TI  - Very late-onset Friedreich ataxia despite large GAA triplet repeat expansions.
PG  - 246-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most patients with Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) have abnormal GAA triplet 
      repeat expansions in both X25 genes. The size of the GAA expansion in the shorter 
      of the 2 expanded alleles correlates significantly with parameters of clinical 
      severity and is inversely related to the age at onset. OBJECTIVES: To describe 
      the clinical and molecular genetic findings in a patient with very late-onset 
      FRDA and to review the literature. PATIENT AND METHODS: A 58-year-old white woman 
      with mild progressive gait disturbance of 15 years' duration whose examination 
      revealed mild incoordination was analyzed for mutations in the X25 gene. A 
      combination of long-range polymerase chain reaction and genomic Southern blot 
      analyses were used to identify GAA expansions in intron 1 of the X25 gene. To 
      uncover evidence of somatic variability in triplet repeat length, DNA isolated 
      from several tissue samples was similarly analyzed. Single-strand conformational 
      polymorphism analysis was used to screen for mutations spanning the entire coding 
      sequence of frataxin and all intron-exon junctions of the X25 gene. RESULTS: DNA 
      isolated from blood leukocytes revealed GAA triplet repeat expansions in both X25 
      genes, which were estimated to contain 835 and 1200 repeats. Similar expansions 
      were detected in DNA isolated from lymphoblasts, fibroblasts, buccal cells, and 
      sural nerve, with estimated mean (+/- SD) lengths of the shorter and longer 
      expansions being 854 (+/-69) and 1283 (+/-72) triplets, respectively. A review of 
      reported cases of late-onset Friedreich ataxia (25-39 years) and very late-onset 
      Friedreich ataxia (> or =40 years) demonstrated that this is the first instance 
      of a patient presenting with very late-onset FRDA despite carrying more than 800 
      GAA repeats in both expanded X25 alleles. CONCLUSIONS: This unique case of very 
      late-onset FRDA highlights a limitation in our ability to accurately predict the 
      phenotype in FRDA based solely on the size of the GAA expansion. Other genetic or 
      environmental factors may significantly modify disease severity in FRDA.

TI  - Somatic sequence variation at the Friedreich ataxia locus includes complete 
      contraction of the expanded GAA triplet repeat, significant length variation in 
      serially passaged lymphoblasts and enhanced mutagenesis in the flanking sequence.
PG  - 2425-36
AB  - The vast majority of Friedreich ataxia patients are homozygous for large GAA 
      triplet repeat expansions in intron 1 of the X25 gene. Instability of the 
      expanded GAA repeat was examined in 23 chromosomes bearing 97-1250 triplets in 
      lymphoblastoid cell lines passaged 20-39 times. Southern analyses revealed 18 
      events of significant changes in length ranging from 69 to 633 triplets, wherein 
      the de novo allele gradually replaced the original over 1-6 passages. 
      Contractions and expansions occurred with equal frequency and magnitude. This 
      behavior is unique in comparison with other large, non-coding triplet repeat 
      expansions [(CGG)(n)and (CTG)(n)] which remain relatively stable under similar 
      conditions. We also report a rare patient who, having inherited two expanded 
      alleles, showed evidence of contracted GAA repeats ranging from nine to 29 
      triplets in DNA from two independent peripheral blood samples. The GAA triplet 
      repeat is known to adopt a triplex structure, and triplexes in transcribed 
      templates cause enhanced mutagenesis. The poly(A) tract and a 135 bp sequence, 
      both situated immediately upstream of the GAA triplet repeat, were therefore 
      examined for somatic mutations. The poly(A) tract showed enhanced instability 
      when in cis with the GAA expansion. The 135 bp upstream sequence was found to 
      harbor a 3-fold excess of point mutations in DNA derived from individuals 
      homozygous for the GAA triplet repeat expansion compared with normal controls. 
      These data are likely to have important mechanistic and clinical implications.

TI  - Sticky DNA: self-association properties of long GAA.TTC repeats in R.R.Y triplex 
      structures from Friedreich's ataxia.
PG  - 465-75
AB  - A novel DNA structure, sticky DNA, is described for lengths of (GAA.TTC)n found 
      in intron 1 of the frataxin gene of Friedreich's ataxia patients. Sticky DNA is 
      formed by the association of two purine.purine.pyrimidine (R.R.Y) triplexes in 
      negatively supercoiled plasmids at neutral pH. An excellent correlation was found 
      between the lengths of (GAA.TTC) (> 59 repeats): first, in FRDA patients, second, 
      required to inhibit transcription in vivo and in vitro, and third, required to 
      adopt the sticky conformation. Fourth, (GAAGGA.TCCTTC)65, also found in intron 1, 
      does not form sticky DNA, inhibit transcription, or associate with the disease. 
      Hence, R.R.Y triplexes and/or sticky DNA may be involved in the etiology of FRDA.

TI  - Intermediate expansions of a GAA repeat in the frataxin gene are not associated 
      with type 2 diabetes or altered glucose-induced beta-cell function in Danish 
      Caucasians.
PG  - 914-7
AB  - A variable expansion of a GAA repeat is present in the first intron of the 
      frataxin gene, also termed FRDA1 or X25. Long repeat lengths (>66 repeats) are 
      present in patients with Friedreich's ataxia, while an intermediate expansion 
      (10-66 repeats) has recently been reported to be highly associated with type 2 
      diabetes. Using a polymerase chain reaction-based assay, we found that 32.4% 
      (95%CI 29.9-34.9) of 636 Danish Caucasian type 2 diabetic patients were carriers 
      of an intermediate expansion, whereas the frequency was 30.4% (26.4-34.4) among 
      224 matched glucose-tolerant control subjects (P = 0.6). In the control subjects, 
      the values of serum insulin and C-peptide responses during an oral glucose 
      tolerance test were similar between the 69 carriers and 155 noncarriers. 
      Furthermore, we investigated a possible relationship between expansions of the 
      FRDA1 gene and glucose-induced beta-cell function in 338 young Caucasians (33.7% 
      [30.1-37.3] carriers) and in 215 glucose-tolerant subjects (31.0% [26.6-35.4] 
      carriers) with a type 2 diabetic parent. In neither population did the carriers 
      differ from noncarriers according to values of fasting plasma glucose, serum

TI  - Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analysis in German Friedreich ataxia 
      families.
PG  - 90-6
AB  - The main mutation causing Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is the expansion of a GAA 
      repeat localized within the intron between exon 1 and exon 2 of the gene X25. 
      This expansion has been observed in 98% of FRDA chromosomes. To analyze 
      frequencies of markers tightly linked to the Friedreich ataxia gene and to 
      investigate wheter a limited number of ancestral chromosomes are shared by German 
      FRDA families, a detailed analysis employing nine polymorphic markers was 
      performed. We found strong linkage disequilibria and association of FRDA 
      expansions with a few haplotypes. FRDA haplotypes differ significantly from 
      control haplotypes. Our results confirm that GAA repeat expansions in intron 1 of 
      the frataxin gene are limited to a few chromosomes and indicate an obvious 
      founder effect in German patients. Based on these analyses, we estimate a minimum 
      age of the mutation of 107 generations.

TI  - Parental gender, age at birth and expansion length influence GAA repeat 
      intergenerational instability in the X25 gene: pedigree studies and analysis of 
      sperm from patients with Friedreich's ataxia.
PG  - 1901-6
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia is the first known autosomal recessive disease caused by an 
      unstable trinucleotide expansion mutation. The most frequent mutation is 
      expansion of a GAA repeat in the first intron of gene X25. We studied 
      transmission of the expanded GAA repeat in 37 Friedreich's ataxia pedigrees and 
      analysed blood and sperm alleles in eight patients. We showed intergenerational 
      instability in 84% of the alleles with an overall excess of contractions. Both 
      contractions and expansions of the GAA repeat occurred in maternal transmission 
      with a stronger tendency to expand for smaller repeats and to contract for longer 
      repeats. Paternally transmitted alleles contracted only. Parental age and the 
      intergenerational change in expansion size were directly correlated in maternal 
      transmission and inversely in paternal transmission. The size of the GAA 
      expansion was slightly lower in patients than heterozygous carriers. Sperm 
      analysis confirmed the tendency to contract of paternal alleles, which was more 
      marked with ageing. The degree of contraction of the GAA repeat in sperm was much 
      higher than that found in intergenerational transmission and was directly related 
      to the repeat size. A blood expanded allele reverted to normal size in the sperm 
      of one patient. This study suggests the existence of different mutational 
      mechanisms in Friedreich's ataxia alleles, which occur both pre- and 
      post-zygotically.

TI  - Identification of a missense mutation in a Friedreich's ataxia patient: 
      implications for diagnosis and carrier studies.
PG  - 396-9
AB  - Approximately 95% of all Friedreich's ataxia (FA) patients are homozygous for a 
      large GAA triplet-repeat expansion in the first intron of the Friedreich's ataxia 
      gene (FRDA). The remaining cases are expected to be compound heterozygous with a 
      GAA expansion on one allele and a point mutation on the other. Generally, the 
      clinical diagnostic profile in this group of patients is indistinguishable from 
      that in classic FA patients with homozygous expansions. This study describes a 
      mildly affected patient who presents with only one expanded allele by Southern 
      blot analysis. Point mutation screening shows a single base change in FRDA exon 3 
      resulting in a nonconservative amino acid replacement in the N-terminal portion 
      of the frataxin protein. Extended family studies show that two of the patient's 
      sibs are carriers of the expanded allele and one is a carrier of the missense 
      mutation. This case study demonstrates the benefits of implementing a combined 
      Southern blot and point mutation diagnostic protocol for compound heterozygous 
      patients. By identifying both mutations, this procedure confirms the diagnosis of 
      FA in patients with an atypical disease course and allows for more complete 
      family studies.

TI  - Mutation of the start codon in the FRDA1 gene: linkage analysis of three 
      pedigrees with the ATG to ATT transversion points to a unique common ancestor.
PG  - 102-5
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by 
      loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding frataxin. Most patients with FRDA 
      have trinucleotide repeat expansions in both alleles of the FRDA 1 gene. In 
      patients heterozygous for the expansion the second allele may be inactivated by a 
      point mutation. We identified the ATG-->ATT (M11) mutation of the start codon in 
      three independent families. Individuals with symptoms of FRDA in these families 
      are compound heterozygous for the repeat expansion and the ATG mutation. To look 
      for a common founder of the M11 mutation, a detailed linkage analysis employing 
      six polymorphic chromosome 9 markers was performed. We found complete haplotype 
      identity for two of the three chromosomes with the point mutation. The third case 
      shows partial conformity and may be the result of a single recombination event.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is caused by point mutations or trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions in both alleles of the gene encoding frataxin. Studies of frataxin 
      homologues in lower eukaryotes suggest that mitochondrial iron accumulation may 
      underlie the pathophysiology of FRDA. To evaluate the possible role of 
      iron-chelation therapy for FRDA, we measured serum iron and ferritin 
      concentrations in 10 FRDA patients. The measurements were within normal limits, 
      suggesting that iron-chelation therapy for FRDA may be problematic.

TI  - The natural history of degenerative ataxia: a retrospective study in 466 
      patients.
PG  - 589-600
AB  - The aim of the present study was (i) to compare disease progression and survival 
      in different types of degenerative ataxia, and (ii) to identify variables that 
      may modify the rate of disease progression. We included patients suffering from 
      Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA, n = 83), early onset cerebellar ataxia (EOCA, n = 30), 
      autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) type I (ADCA-I, n = 273), ADCA-III (n 
      = 13) and multiple system atrophy (MSA, n = 67). Molecular genetic testing 
      allowed us to assign 202 ADCA-I patients to one of the following subgroups: 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type I (SCAI, n = 36), SCA2 (n = 56) and SCA3 (n = 110). 
      To assess disease progression we defined the following disease stages: stage 0 = 
      no gait difficulties; stage 1 = disease onset, as defined by onset of gait 
      difficulties; stage 2 = loss of independent gait; stage 3 = confinement to 
      wheelchair; stage 4 = death. Disease progression was most rapid in MSA, 
      intermediate in FRDA, ADCA-I and ADCA-III and slowest in EOCA. The rate of 
      progression was similar in SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3. The CAG repeat length was a 
      significant risk factor for faster progression in SCA2 and SCA3, but not in SCA1. 
      In FRDA, the time until confinement to wheelchair was shorter in patients with 
      earlier disease onset, suggesting that patients with long GAA repeats and early 
      disease onset have a poor prognosis. Female gender increased the risk of becoming 
      dependent on walking aids or a wheelchair, but it did not influence survival in 
      FRDA, SCA3 and MSA. In SCA2, female gender was associated with shortened 
      survival. In MSA, later age of onset increased the risk of rapid progression and 
      death.

TI  - The GAA triplet-repeat expansion in Friedreich ataxia interferes with 
      transcription and may be associated with an unusual DNA structure.
PG  - 111-21
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disease is 
      the most common inherited ataxia. The vast majority of patients are homozygous 
      for an abnormal expansion of a polymorphic GAA triplet repeat in the first intron 
      of the X25 gene, which encodes a mitochondrial protein, frataxin. Cellular 
      degeneration in FRDA may be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, possibly due to 
      abnormal iron accumulation, as observed in yeast cells deficient for a frataxin 
      homologue. Using RNase protection assays, we have shown that patients homozygous 
      for the expansion have a marked deficiency of mature X25 mRNA. The mechanism(s) 
      by which the intronic GAA triplet expansion results in this reduction of X25 mRNA 
      is presently unknown. No evidence was found for abnormal splicing of the expanded 
      intron 1. Using cloned repeat sequences from FRDA patients, we show that the GAA 
      repeat per se interferes with in vitro transcription in a length-dependent 
      manner, with both prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes. This interference was most 
      pronounced in the physiological orientation of transcription, when synthesis of 
      the GAA-rich transcript was attempted. These results are consistent with the 
      observed negative correlation between triplet-repeat length and the age at onset 
      of disease. Using in vitro chemical probing strategies, we also show that the GAA 
      triplet repeat adopts an unusual DNA structure, demonstrated by hyperreactivity 
      to osmium tetroxide, hydroxylamine, and diethyl pyrocarbonate. These results 
      raise the possibility that the GAA triplet-repeat expansion may result in an 
      unusual yet stable DNA structure that interferes with transcription, ultimately 
      leading to a cellular deficiency of frataxin.

TI  - A mild case of Friedreich ataxia: lymphocyte and sural nerve analysis for GAA 
      repeat length reveals somatic mosaicism.
PG  - 390-3
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disease, 
      characterized by progressive gait and limb ataxia, dysarthria, lower-limb 
      areflexia, Babinski sign, loss of position and vibration senses, cardiomyopathy, 
      and carbohydrate intolerance. It is the most common inherited ataxia, and is 
      associated with a GAA triplet repeat expansion in the first intron of the X25 
      gene on the long arm of chromosome 9. We present a case whose clinical diagnosis 
      was initially confounded by the mildness of the ataxic phenotype and a family 
      history of multiple sclerosis. Evaluation of the X25 gene revealed that the 
      patient was homozygous for the GAA triplet repeat expansion, pathognomonic of 
      FRDA. Investigation of her sural nerve biopsy revealed a significantly smaller 
      expansion size, constituting the first direct demonstration of somatic mosaicism 
      involving the nervous system in FRDA. We speculate that a similar contraction in 
      pathologically affected tissues could be the molecular basis for the mildness of 
      the ataxia.

TI  - Friedreich's ataxia. Revision of the phenotype according to molecular genetics.
PG  - 2131-40
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia is an autosomal recessively inherited neurodegenerative 
      disorder caused by expansions of an unstable GAA trinucleotide repeat in the 
      STM7/X25 gene on chromosome 9q. We studied the (GAA)n polymorphism in 178 healthy 
      controls and 102 patients with idiopathic ataxia. The repeat size ranged from 7 
      to 29 (GAA)n motifs on normal chromosomes and from 66 to 1360 trinucleotide 
      repetitions in Friedreich's ataxia patients. Meiotic instability of expanded 
      alleles was observed without significant differences in maternal and paternal 
      transmissions. Thirty-six of 102 patients were typed homozygous for expanded 
      (GAA)n alleles. Twenty-seven of these presented with the typical Friedreich's 
      ataxia symptoms and nine patients with an atypical Friedreich's ataxia phenotype. 
      Before molecular genetic diagnosis had been performed seven of these patients had 
      been classified as early onset cerebellar ataxia and two as idiopathic sporadic 
      cerebellar ataxia of late onset. In contrast, in one family with typical 
      Friedreich's ataxia phenotype we did not find an expanded allele; this suggests 
      that there can be either point mutations in the X25 gene on both chromosomes or 
      locus heterogeneity in Friedreich's ataxia. The phenotypic spectrum of 
      Friedreich's ataxia is much broader than considered before. Early onset, 
      areflexia, extensor plantar responses and reduced vibration sense should no 
      longer be considered essential diagnostic criteria of Friedreich's ataxia. In 
      comparison with the non-Friedreich's ataxia group hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
      seems to be the only symptom specific for Friedreich's ataxia. However, it is not 
      obligatory. The phenotype is significantly influenced by the number of GAA 
      repeats with close genotype-phenotype relationships when the smaller of the two 
      alleles is considered. Repeat length correlated inversely with age at onset, 
      onset of dysarthria and progression rate. In conclusion, molecular genetic 
      analysis appears mandatory for the diagnosis and genetic counselling of 
      Friedreich's ataxia. The molecular genetic test should be applied not only to 
      patients with typical Friedreich's ataxia phenotype but also in all cases of 
      idiopathic autosomal recessive or sporadic ataxia.

PG  - 1617-20
AB  - We describe three siblings from an Italian family affected by an autosomal 
      recessive spinocerebellar degeneration. Gait ataxia, presenting between 38 and 45 
      years, was the first symptom in all three patients. Dysarthria, dysmetria, brisk 
      tendon reflexes, extensor plantar response, and scoliosis were constant features. 
      Disease progression was slow. Electrophysiologic studies demonstrated a slight 
      reduction in sural nerve sensory action potential in only one patient. Analysis 
      of GAA expansion within the X25 gene showed that patients were homozygous for the 
      expansion, with the shorter expanded allele ranging from 120 to 156 triplets. The 
      size of the GAA expansion may be smaller than we previously described. Such 
      minimal expansions may result in atypical forms of Friedreich's ataxia.

TI  - Aconitase and mitochondrial iron-sulphur protein deficiency in Friedreich ataxia.
PG  - 215-7
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a common autosomal recessive degenerative disease 
      (1/50,000 live births) characterized by a progressive-gait and limb ataxia with 
      lack of tendon reflexes in the legs, dysarthria and pyramidal weakness of the 
      inferior limbs. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is observed in most FRDA patients. 
      The gene associated with the disease has been mapped to chromosome 9q13 (ref. 3) 
      and encodes a 210-amino-acid protein, frataxin. FRDA is caused primarily by a GAA 
      repeat expansion within the first intron of the frataxin gene, which accounts for 
      98% of mutant alleles. The function of the protein is unknown, but an increased 
      iron content has been reported in hearts of FRDA patients and in mitochondria of 
      yeast strains carrying a deleted frataxin gene counterpart (YFH1), suggesting 
      that frataxin plays a major role in regulating mitochondrial iron transport. 
      Here, we report a deficient activity of the iron-sulphur (Fe-S) 
      cluster-containing subunits of mitochondrial respiratory complexes I, II and III 
      in the endomyocardial biopsy of two unrelated FRDA patients. Aconitase, an 
      iron-sulphur protein involved in iron homeostasis, was found to be deficient as 
      well. Moreover, disruption of the YFH1 gene resulted in multiple Fe-S-dependent 
      enzyme deficiencies in yeast. The deficiency of Fe-S-dependent enzyme activities 
      in both FRDA patients and yeast should be related to mitochondrial iron 
      accumulation, especially as Fe-S proteins are remarkably sensitive to free 
      radicals. Mutated frataxin triggers aconitase and mitochondrial Fe-S respiratory 
      enzyme deficiency in FRDA, which should therefore be regarded as a mitochondrial 
      disorder.

TI  - Friedreich's ataxia GAA repeat expansion in patients with recessive or sporadic 
      ataxia.
PG  - 1004-9
AB  - To explore the clinical heterogeneity associated with the Friedreich's ataxia 
      (FRDA) expanded repeat and provide preliminary guidance for future gene testing 
      in patients suspected of having FRDA, we tested patients with typical FRDA (group 
      I), late-onset FRDA or FRDA with retained reflexes (group II), as well as those 
      with early onset "non-Friedreich's" recessive or sporadic ataxia (group III). 
      Eighty-seven percent of families in group I tested positive for the FRDA triplet 
      repeat expansion. Thirty-six percent of families in group II demonstrated the 
      FRDA expansion. Only one of 11 patients in group III had the FRDA expansion. 
      Clinical criteria did not clearly distinguish between expansion-positive and 
      expansion-negative individuals in groups I and II. Minimal criteria that were 
      present in all the patients who tested positive were recessive or sporadic 
      inheritance, progressive caudal-rostral gait and limb ataxia, and at least one of 
      the following: dysarthria, Babinski sign, or cardiomyopathy. This study confirms 
      recent findings that some patients in group II can carry the FRDA mutation. 
      However, we did not observe the FRDA expansion in 64% of group II families or in 
      13% of families with typical FRDA (group I), suggesting other genetic or 
      environmental causes for their ataxia.

TI  - GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in variant Friedreich's ataxia families.
PG  - 1121-6
AB  - Phenotypic variants in Friedreich's ataxia include late onset, preservation of 
      the lower limbs tendon reflexes, and slow progression. We describe clinical and 
      electrophysiological features from three families with Friedreichlike phenotypes. 
      Friedreich's ataxia diagnosis was confirmed by finding two allelic expansions of 
      the GAA trinucleotide repeat at the X25 gene. In family 1 both patients had a 
      late-onset phenotype with preservation of knee and ankle jerks, lack of 
      cardiomyopathy, and preserved H reflex. One of them did not have 
      electrophysiologic evidence of sensory axonal neuropathy. Patients from family 2 
      showed variability in the age of onset, and 2 out of 3 affected children had 
      hyperactive lower limbs reflexes with preserved H reflex. Disease progression in 
      a patient from family 3 was very slow after onset at the age of 21. The finding 
      of two expanded alleles in these families confirms the wide variability of the 
      clinical spectrum of Friedreich's ataxia.

TI  - Somatic mosaicism for Friedreich's ataxia GAA triplet repeat expansions in the 
      central nervous system.
PG  - 606-10
AB  - Most patients with Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) carry expanded GAA repeats in both 
      homologues of the frataxin gene on chromosome 9. We determined the size of the 
      GAA repeats in autopsied samples from the CNS of six FRDA patients. We observed 
      heterogeneity of repeat sizes in different CNS regions, indicative of extensive 
      mitotic instability. Samples from the same CNS subdivision (e.g., cortex, 
      thalamus) contained a similar mixture of alleles, suggesting that the pattern of 
      repeat size mosaicism reflects the developmental history of each sample. Regional 
      differences in repeat size could not account for the characteristic distribution 
      of pathology in FRDA, which appears instead to be related to the pattern of 
      frataxin expression.

TI  - Respiratory deficiency due to loss of mitochondrial DNA in yeast lacking the 
      frataxin homologue.
PG  - 352-7
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive degenerative disorder that 
      primarily affects the nervous system and heart. Patients with FRDA have point 
      mutations or trinucleotide repeat expansions in both alleles of FRDA, which 
      encodes a protein termed frataxin. We show that the yeast frataxin homologue, 
      which we have named YFH1, localizes to mitochondria and is required to maintain 
      mitochondrial DNA. The YFH1-homologous domain of frataxin functions in yeast and 
      a disease-associated missense mutation of this domain, or the corresponding 
      domain in YFH1, reduces function. Our data suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction 
      contributes to FRDA pathophysiology.

      phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase activity.
PG  - 170-2
AB  - The STM7 gene encodes a novel phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PtdInsP 
      5-kinase) that is subject to alternative splicing and developmental control. We 
      have recently presented data indicating that several splice variants of STM7 
      incorporate elements of the X25 sequence, previously implicated in the 
      pathogenesis of Friedreich's ataxia by the detection of an intronic GAA repeat 
      expansion as the predominant mutation in affected individuals. We now report the 
      exon-intron structure of STM7.I and primer sequences designed to facilitate full 
      characterization, including details relating to a novel exon (STM7; exon 17) 
      derived from the 3'-UTR of the PRKACG gene. The detection of a mutation(s) within 
      these exons would provide additional support for the hypothesis that a defect in 
      phosphoinositide metabolism gives rise to the disease phenotype.

TI  - Phenotypic variability in Friedreich ataxia: role of the associated GAA triplet 
      repeat expansion.
PG  - 675-82
AB  - We studied genotype-phenotype correlations in a group of 100 patients with 
      typical Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), and in three groups of patients with atypical 
      clinical presentations, including 44 Acadian FRDA, 8 late-onset FRDA (LOFA), and 
      6 FRDA with retained reflexes (FARR). All patients, except 3 with typical FRDA, 
      carried two copies of the FRDA-associated GAA triplet repeat expansion. Overall, 
      the phenotypic spectrum of FRDA appeared to be wider than defined by the 
      currently used diagnostic criteria. Our study indicated the existence of several 
      sources of variability in FRDA. Patients with larger GAA expansions tended to 
      have earlier onset and were more likely to show additional manifestations of the 
      disease. Mitotic instability of the expanded GAA repeats may partially account 
      for the limited degree of correlation between expansion sizes as determined in 
      lymphocytes and clinical parameters. Some clinical variants associated with 
      specific FRDA haplotypes, such as Acadian FRDA and FARR, turned out to be 
      unrelated to expansion sizes. No polymorphism in the frataxin coding sequence 
      could be associated with these clinical variants.

TI  - Identification and sizing of the GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion of 
      Friedreich's ataxia in 56 patients. Clinical and genetic correlates.
PG  - 673-80
AB  - Fifty-six patients with a clinical diagnosis of Friedreich's ataxia were 
      investigated for the GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion recently found within the 
      gene X25 on chromosome 9. All 56 were found to be homozygous for the expansion, 
      with all but two patients having alleles of differing sizes. The expansion size 
      ranged from 2 to 5 kb, with normal alleles around 1.5 kb. Sizing of the single 
      copy of the expansion in eight sets of parents revealed marked instability in the 
      transmission of the expansion, with both increases and decreases in allele size 
      seen. In Friedreich's ataxia patients there was a significant inverse correlation 
      seen between the average of the two expansions sizes and age of onset of 
      symptoms. The GAA repeat expansion was found in the homozygous state in atypical 
      cases of Friedreich's ataxia, such as older age of onset, preservation of lower 
      limb reflexes and cardiac presentations. In three families the father had onset 
      of spinocerebellar ataxia as an adult, and in two the possibility of partial 
      expression in heterozygote carrier fathers has been raised. More importantly, the 
      history of an ataxic syndrome in a parent does not exclude the diagnosis of 
      Friedreich's ataxia in the offspring, and tests for the expansion should be 
      carried out. The third family with an affected father conforms to previously 
      described 'pseudodominant' inheritance.

TI  - Estimated contribution of known ataxia genes in ataxia patients undergoing DNA 
      testing.
PG  - 275-8
AB  - We estimated the relative contributions of known ataxia genes (SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 
      and X25) in the patient population sent to our DNA diagnostic laboratory for 
      diagnostic testing. Approximately 28% of these patients had an abnormal triplet 
      repeat expansion in one of these ataxia genes (3% for SCA1, 8% for SCA2, 11% for 
      SCA3/MJD, 2% for SCA6, 3% for SCA7, and 1.5% for X25). The lack of abnormal 
      repeat expansions in the majority of ataxis patients tested suggests that the 
      molecular defects associated with most ataxia cases are currently undetermined 
      and that this population includes both familial and sporadic cases. In contrast, 
      of the patients submitted for genetic testing for Friedrich's ataxia (FRDA), 44% 
      (69/157) showed at least one expansion in the X25 gene, indicating that FRDA 
      accounts for a significant proportion of the recessively inherited ataxias and 
      appears to have a high rate of accurate clinical diagnosis. On the basis of our 
      DNA studies, we propose a comprehensive and efficient approach for molecular 
      analysis of ataxia patients.

TI  - Frataxin shows developmentally regulated tissue-specific expression in the mouse 
      embryo.
PG  - 103-13
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive degenerative disease caused 
      either by an intronic GAA triplet repeat expansion that suppresses the expression 
      of the frataxin gene on chromosome 9q13, or, rarely, by point mutations in the 
      frataxin gene. We investigated the expression of the mouse frataxin homologue 
      during embryonic development by Northern blot analysis and RNA in situ 
      hybridization. Very faint expression could be detected from E10.5 in the 
      neuroepithelium and more clearly from E12.5 in the developing central nervous 
      system. At E14.5, frataxin was expressed at a much higher level that remained 
      constant into the postnatal period. Maximum expression was observed in the spinal 
      cord, particularly at the thoracolumbar level, and in the dorsal root ganglia. 
      Significant levels of transcript could also be detected in the proliferating 
      cells in the periventricular zone, in the cortical plates, in the heart, in the 
      axial skeleton, and in some epithelial and mesenchymal tissues. Overall, the 
      distribution of frataxin mRNA was in good accordance with previous data from 
      Northern analysis of adult human tissues, the major discrepancy being the 
      expression in mouse embryonic cerebral cortex which was not observed in adult 
      human brain. The tissues expressing frataxin during development appear to be 
      those that become dysfunctional or atrophied in FRDA. Overall, our data suggest 
      that frataxin is a protein whose expression is cell-specific and developmentally 
      regulated.

TI  - The relationship between trinucleotide (GAA) repeat length and clinical features 
      in Friedreich ataxia.
PG  - 554-60
AB  - Friedreich ataxia (FA) is associated with the expansion of a GAA trinucleotide 
      repeat in the first intron of the X25 gene. We found both alleles expanded in 67 
      FA patients from 48 Italian families. Five patients from three families were 
      compound heterozygotes with expansion on one allele and an 
      isoleucine-->phenylalanine change at position 154 on the other one. We found 
      neither expansions nor point mutations in three patients. The length of FA 
      alleles ranged from 201 to 1,186 repeat units, with no overlap with the normal 
      range, and showed a negatively skewed distribution with a peak between 800 and 
      1,000 repeats. The FA repeat showed meiotic instability with a median variation 
      of 150 repeats. The lengths of both larger and smaller alleles in each patient 
      inversely correlated with age at onset of the disorder. Smaller alleles showed 
      the best correlation, accounting for approximately 50% of the variation of age at 
      onset. Mean allele length was significantly higher in patients with diabetes and 
      in those with cardiomyopathy.

TI  - Friedreich's ataxia: autosomal recessive disease caused by an intronic GAA 
      triplet repeat expansion.
PG  - 1423-7
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive, degenerative disease that 
      involves the central and peripheral nervous systems and the heart. A gene, X25, 
      was identified in the critical region for the FRDA locus on chromosome 9q13. This 
      gene encodes a 210-amino acid protein, frataxin, that has homologs in distant 
      species such as Caenorhabditis elegans and yeast. A few FRDA patients were found 
      to have point mutations in X25, but the majority were homozygous for an unstable 
      GAA trinucleotide expansion in the first X25 intron.
