TI  - Characterizing Cellular Expansion of Idecabtagene Vicleucel and Association with 
      Clinical Efficacy and Safety in Patients with Triple-Class-Exposed 
      Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma.
LID - 10.1002/jcph.70075 [doi]
AB  - Idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel, ABECMA) is an autologous, B-cell maturation 
      antigen-directed, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, which has 
      demonstrated significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
      response rate (ORR) in patients with triple-class-exposed relapsed/refractory 
      multiple myeloma (TCE RRMM). Here, we characterize cellular expansion of ide-cel 
      in vivo and further evaluate associations between cellular expansion and clinical 
      efficacy and safety endpoints. The exposure parameters of ide-cel were evaluated 
      through non-compartmental analysis methods using the time course data of CAR 
      transgene copy numbers collected from the ide-cel arm of Study KarMMa-3 
      (NCT03651128). Multivariable regression analyses were conducted between the 
      exposure parameters and clinical responses to characterize relationships between 
      cellular expansion in vivo and clinical outcomes and to evaluate potential 
      effects of covariates on the exposure-response (E-R) relationships. There appears 
      to be lack of a strong association between actual ide-cel dose and cellular 
      expansion at the dose range evaluated in Study KarMMa-3. The multivariable E-R 
      regression models suggest positive relationships between cellular expansion and 
      clinical efficacy and safety endpoints, with higher exposure associated with 
      longer PFS, higher ORR, and higher rates of cytokine release syndrome requiring 
      tocilizumab or corticosteroids. The current analyses do not identify any 
      clinically relevant covariate effects on the E-R relationships. The positive 
      exposure-response relationships were found to be overall similar between KarMMa-3 
      and a previous study KarMMa. The modeling analyses, paired with clinical data, 
      support extending the dose range from previously approved 300-460 x 10(6) CAR+ T 
      cells to 300-510 x 10(6) CAR+ T cells for TCE RRMM patients.

TI  - Brexucabtagene autoleucel in-vivo expansion and BTKi refractoriness have a 
      negative influence on progression-free survival in mantle cell lymphoma: Results 
      from CART-SIE study.
PG  - 644-651
LID - 10.1111/bjh.19961 [doi]
AB  - Brexucabtagene autoleucel (brexu-cel) has revolutionized the treatment of 
      patients affected by mantle cell lymphomas. In this prospective, observational 
      multicentre study, we evaluated 106 patients, with longitudinal brexu-cel 
      kinetics in peripheral blood monitored in 61 of them. Clinical outcomes and 
      toxicities are consistent with previous real-world evidence studies. Notably, 
      beyond established poor prognostic factors-such as blastoid variant and elevated 
      lactate dehydrogenase-Bruton tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (BTKi) refractoriness and 
      platelet count emerged as significant predictors of survival. Specifically, the 
      1-year overall survival was 56% in BTKi-refractory patients compared to 92% in 
      BTKi-relapsed patients (p = 0.0001). Our study also demonstrated that in-vivo 
      monitoring of brexu-cel expansion is feasible and correlates with 
      progression-free survival and toxicities. Progression-free survival at 1 year was 
      74% in patients categorized as strong expanders, based on brexu-cel peak 
      concentration, versus 54% in poor expanders (p = 0.02). Furthermore, in-vivo 
      expansion helped identify a high-risk group of non-responders, those with 
      progressive or stable disease at the 90-day post-infusion evaluation (OR = 4.7, 
      95% CI = 1.1-34, p = 0.04) characterized by dismal outcomes. When integrated with 
      other clinical factors, monitoring brexu-cel expansion could assist in 
      recognizing patients at high risk of early relapse.

TI  - Common single-base insertions in the VNTR of the carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) gene 
      are benign and also likely to arise somatically in the exocrine pancreas.
PG  - 1001-1014
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddae034 [doi]
AB  - The CEL gene encodes carboxyl ester lipase, a pancreatic digestive enzyme. CEL is 
      extremely polymorphic due to a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) located in 
      the last exon. Single-base deletions within this VNTR cause the inherited 
      disorder MODY8, whereas little is known about VNTR single-base insertions in 
      pancreatic disease. We therefore mapped CEL insertion variants (CEL-INS) in 200 
      Norwegian patients with pancreatic neoplastic disorders. Twenty-eight samples 
      (14.0%) carried CEL-INS alleles. Most common were insertions in repeat 9 (9.5%), 
      which always associated with a VNTR length of 13 repeats. The combined INS allele 
      frequency (0.078) was similar to that observed in a control material of 416 
      subjects (0.075). We performed functional testing in HEK293T cells of a set of 
      CEL-INS variants, in which the insertion site varied from the first to the 12th 
      VNTR repeat. Lipase activity showed little difference among the variants. 
      However, CEL-INS variants with insertions occurring in the most proximal repeats 
      led to protein aggregation and endoplasmic reticulum stress, which upregulated 
      the unfolded protein response. Moreover, by using a CEL-INS-specific antibody, we 
      observed patchy signals in pancreatic tissue from humans without any CEL-INS 
      variant in the germline. Similar pancreatic staining was seen in knock-in mice 
      expressing the most common human CEL VNTR with 16 repeats. CEL-INS proteins may 
      therefore be constantly produced from somatic events in the normal pancreatic 
      parenchyma. This observation along with the high population frequency of CEL-INS 
      alleles strongly suggests that these variants are benign, with a possible 
      exception for insertions in VNTR repeats 1-4.

TI  - Unlocking Predictive Power: Quantitative Assessment of CAR-T Expansion with 
      Digital Droplet Polymerase Chain Reaction (ddPCR).
LID - 10.3390/ijms25052673 [doi]
LID - 2673
AB  - Flow cytometry (FCM) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) are conventional methods for 
      assessing CAR-T expansion, while digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) is emerging as a 
      promising alternative. We monitored CAR-T transcript expansion in 40 B-NHL 
      patients post-infusion of CAR-T products (axi-cel; tisa-cel; and brexu-cel) with 
      both His-Tag FCM and ddPCR techniques. Sensitivity and predictive capacity for 
      efficacy and safety outcomes of ddPCR were analyzed and compared with FCM. A 
      significant correlation between CAR-T counts determined by FCM and CAR 
      transcripts assessed by ddPCR (p < 0.001) was observed. FCM revealed median 
      CD3+CAR+ cell counts at 7, 14, and 30 days post-infusion with no significant 
      differences. In contrast, ddPCR-measured median copies of CAR-T transcripts 
      demonstrated significant lower copy numbers in tisa-cel recipients compared to 
      the other products at day 7 and day 14. Patients with a peak of CAR transcripts 
      at day 7 exceeding 5000 copies/microg gDNA, termed "good CAR-T expanders", were 
      more likely to achieve a favorable response at 3 months (HR 10.79, 95% CI 
      1.16-100.42, p = 0.036). Good CAR-T expanders showed superior progression-free 
      survival at 3, 6, and 12 months compared to poor CAR-T expanders (p = 0.088). 
      Those reaching a peak higher than 5000 copies/microg gDNA were more likely to 
      experience severe CRS and ICANS. DdPCR proves to be a practical method for 
      monitoring CAR-T expansion, providing quantitative information that better 
      predicts both treatment outcomes and toxicity.

AB  - The outcomes of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) 
      previously treated with the 3 main classes of myeloma therapy-immunomodulatory 
      drugs, proteasome inhibitors, and anti-CD38 antibodies-remain poor. Recently, 
      based on the phase II pivotal KarMMa trial showing prolonged overall survival 
      (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in heavily treated patients, 
      idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel), a B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed 
      chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy (CAR-T) product, was approved in 
      the United States for the treatment of RRMM. In France, since June 2021, an early 
      access program has authorized the use of ide-cel in the setting of RRMM (defined 
      as progressive myeloma after at least 3 previous regimens, including the 3 main 
      antimyeloma therapies). We report the first French experience through this early 
      access program in a retrospective study of 24 consecutive patients treated with 
      ide-cel at our institution. The patients were evaluated according to 
      International Myeloma Working Group criteria and by positron emission tomography 
      computed tomography (PET-CT) at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after ide-cel infusion. 
      Most patients had adverse cytogenetic abnormalities, and RRMM with 
      triple-refractory drugs were seen in 79%. Bridging therapy was required for 19 of 
      24 patients. Before CAR-T cell infusion, lymphodepletion with fludarabine and 
      cyclophosphamide was systematically performed. The median follow-up was 15.2 
      months. At 3 months after ide-cel infusion, 92% of patients achieved at least a 
      partial response, and 50% achieved a complete response or better (>/=CR). At 6 
      months, 70% of patients had a persistent >/=CR. At 3 and 6 months, bone marrow 
      minimal residual disease (10(-6) level) was undetectable in 79% and 75% of 
      patients, respectively. At 6 months, CR as assessed by PET-CT was achieved in 15 
      of 20 patients (75%). The median PFS was 14.8 months, and median OS was not 
      reached. Notably, an expansion of circulating CAR-T cells to >180/mm(3) after 
      infusion was strongly associated with prolonged PFS. Additionally, the level of 
      soluble BCMA measured before infusion was identified as a prognostic factor for 
      PFS, likely correlated to the tumor burden. Grade 1-2 cytokine release syndrome 
      (CRS) occurred in 22 of 24 patients (92%). Only 1 patient (4%) experienced grade 
      >/=3 CRS. The occurrence of neurologic toxicity was infrequent (12.5%) and 
      reversible in all cases. Hematologic toxicity was relatively common, and 
      secondary hypogammaglobulinemia occurred in most patients. Infections (mostly 
      viral) were frequent but most often nonsevere. This study echoes the promising 
      results of the KarMMa trial and identifies possible prognostic indicators in RRMM 
      patients treated with ide-cel, potentially refining treatment strategies and 
      improving outcomes in this challenging context.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The CEL gene encodes the digestive enzyme carboxyl ester 
      lipase. CEL-HYB1, a hybrid allele of CEL and its adjacent pseudogene CELP, is a 
      genetic variant suggested to increase the risk of chronic pancreatitis (CP). Our 
      aim was to develop a mouse model for CEL-HYB1 that enables studies of pancreatic 
      disease mechanisms. METHODS: We established a knock-in mouse strain where the 
      variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) region of the endogenous mouse Cel gene 
      was substituted with the mutated VNTR of the human CEL-HYB1 allele. Heterozygous 
      and homozygous Cel-HYB1 mice and littermate wildtype controls were characterized 
      with respect to pancreatic pathology and function. RESULTS: We successfully 
      constructed a mouse model with pancreatic expression of a humanized CEL-HYB1 
      protein. The Cel-HYB1 mice spontaneously developed features of CP including 
      inflammation, acinar atrophy and fatty replacement, and the phenotype became more 
      pronounced as the animals aged. Moreover, Cel-HYB1 mice were normoglycemic at age 
      6 months, whereas at 12 months they exhibited impaired glucose tolerance. 
      Immunostaining of pancreatic tissue indicated the formation of CEL protein 
      aggregates, and electron microscopy showed dilated endoplasmic reticulum. 
      Upregulation of the stress marker BiP/GRP78 was seen in pancreatic parenchyma 
      obtained both from Cel-HYB1 animals and from a human CEL-HYB1 carrier. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a new mouse model for CP that confirms the 
      pathogenicity of the human CEL-HYB1 variant. Our findings place CEL-HYB1 in the 
      group of genes that increase CP risk through protein misfolding-dependent 
      pathways.

TI  - Phenotypic Composition of Commercial Anti-CD19 CAR T Cells Affects In Vivo 
      Expansion and Disease Response in Patients with Large B-cell Lymphoma.
PG  - 3378-3386
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-0164 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In clinical trials, the expansion and persistence of chimeric antigen 
      receptor (CAR) T cells correlate with therapeutic efficacy. However, properties 
      of CAR T cells that enable their in vivo proliferation have still to be 
      consistently defined and the role of CAR T bag content has never been 
      investigated in a real-life setting. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Residual cells obtained 
      after washing 61 anti-CD19 CAR T product bags were analyzed to identify 
      tisagenlecleucel/Tisa-cel and axicabtagene ciloleucel/Axi-cel phenotypic features 
      associated with postinfusion CAR T-cell in vivo expansion and with response and 
      survival. RESULTS: While Tisa-cel was characterized by a significant enrichment 
      in CAR+CD4+ T cells with central memory (P < 0.005) and effector (P < 0.005) 
      phenotypes and lower rates of CAR+CD8+ with effector memory (P < 0.005) and 
      naive-like (P < 0.05) phenotypes as compared with Axi-cel, the two products 
      displayed similar expansion kinetics. In vivo CAR T-cell expansion was influenced 
      by the presence of CAR T with a CD8+ T central memory signature (P < 0.005) in 
      both Tisa-cel and Axi-cel infusion products and was positively associated with 
      response and progression-free survival (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate 
      that despite the great heterogeneity of Tisa-cel and Axi-cel products, the 
      differentiation status of the infused cells mediates CAR T-cell in vivo 
      proliferation that is necessary for antitumor response.

TI  - High Phenotypic Variation between an In Vitro-Passaged Fowl Adenovirus Serotype 1 
      (FAdV-1) and Its Virulent Progenitor Strain despite Almost Complete Sequence 
      Identity of the Whole Genomes.
LID - 10.3390/v14020358 [doi]
LID - 358
AB  - Adenoviral gizzard erosion is an emerging disease with negative impact on health 
      and production of chickens. In this study, we compared in vitro and in vivo 
      characteristics of a fowl adenovirus serotype 1 (FAdV-1), attenuated by 53 
      consecutive passages in primary chicken embryo liver (CEL) cell cultures 
      (11/7127-AT), with the virulent strain (11/7127-VT). Whole genome analysis 
      revealed near-complete sequence identity between the strains. However, a length 
      polymorphism in a non-coding adenine repeat sequence (11/7127-AT: 11 instead of 
      9) immediately downstream of the hexon open reading frame was revealed. One-step 
      growth kinetics showed delayed multiplication of 11/7127-AT together with 
      significantly lower titers in cell culture (up to 4 log(10) difference), 
      indicating reduced replication efficiency in vitro. In vivo pathogenicity and 
      immunogenicity were determined in day-old specific pathogen-free layer chicks 
      inoculated orally with the respective viruses. In contrast to birds infected with 
      11/7127-VT, birds infected with 11/7127-AT did not exhibit body weight loss or 
      severe pathological lesions in the gizzard. Virus detection rates, viral load in 
      organs and virus excretion were significantly lower in birds inoculated with 
      11/7127-AT. Throughout the experimental period, these birds did not develop 
      measurable neutralizing antibodies, prevalent in birds in response to 11/7127-VT 
      infection. Differences in pathogenicity between the virulent FAdV-1 and the 
      attenuated strain could not be correlated to prominently discriminate genomic 
      features. We conclude that differential in vitro growth profiles indicate that 
      attenuation is linked to modulation of viral replication during interaction of 
      the virus with the host cells. Thus, hosts would be unable to prevent the rapid 
      replication of virulent FAdV leading to severe tissue damage, a phenomenon 
      broadly applicable to further FAdV serotypes, considering the substantial 
      intra-serotype virulence differences of FAdVs and the variation of diseases.

TI  - In Vivo Cellular Expansion of Lisocabtagene Maraleucel and Association With 
      Efficacy and Safety in Relapsed/Refractory Large B-Cell Lymphoma.
PG  - 81-89
LID - 10.1002/cpt.2561 [doi]
AB  - Lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) is an autologous, CD19-directed, chimeric 
      antigen receptor T-cell product for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed 
      or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) after 2 or more lines of systemic 
      therapy. In vivo cellular expansion after single-dose administration of liso-cel 
      has been characterized. In this article, in vivo liso-cel expansion in the 
      pivotal study TRANSCEND NHL 001 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT02631044) was 
      further characterized to assess the relationship between in vivo cellular 
      expansion after single-dose administration of liso-cel and efficacy or safety 
      after adjusting for key baseline characteristics. Two bioanalytical methods, 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry, were used for the 
      assessment of cellular kinetics of liso-cel, which showed high concordance for in 
      vivo cellular expansion. Multivariable logistic regression analyses demonstrated 
      that higher in vivo cellular expansion of liso-cel was associated with a higher 
      overall response and complete response rate, and a higher incidence of cytokine 
      release syndrome and neurological events in patients with relapsed or refractory 
      LBCL. Age and tumor burden (by sum of the product of perpendicular diameters) 
      were likely to confound the relationship between in vivo cellular expansion and 
      efficacy, where the association became stronger after controlling for these 
      factors. Repeat dosing of liso-cel was tested in the study; however, in vivo 
      cellular expansion of liso-cel was lower after repeat dosing than after the 
      initial dose. These findings should enable a comprehensive understanding of the 
      in vivo cellular kinetics of liso-cel and the association with outcomes in 
      relapsed/refractory LBCL.

TI  - Identification of a Novel Mutation in Carboxyl Ester Lipase Gene in a Patient 
      with MODY-like Diabetes.
PG  - 37-41
LID - 10.1620/tjem.256.37 [doi]
AB  - Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a form of diabetes mellitus 
      characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, early onset, and the absence of 
      pancreatic autoimmune markers. MODY-causing mutations have been identified in 14 
      genes, and carboxyl ester lipase (CEL) has been implicated in MODY8. We report a 
      Japanese patient with MODY who harbored a heterogeneous mutation in CEL exon 2 
      (NM_001807.4:c.146_147delCT; NP_001798.2:p.Ser49CysfsTer52). A 13-year-old girl 
      experienced her first episode of diabetic ketoacidosis, during which her 
      endogenous insulin secretion was poor. However, her insulin secretion had 
      apparently recovered 2 months after the commencement of insulin treatment, and no 
      further treatment was required for the following 2 years. Diabetic ketoacidosis 
      recurred when the patient was 15 years old, when her insulin secretion was again 
      poor. Since that time, the patient, who is now 18 years old, has been undergoing 
      continuous insulin treatment. The large fluctuations in her insulin secretory 
      capacity led us to suspect MODY. MODY8 patients that carry a mutation in the 
      variable number of tandem repeats in the last exon of the CEL gene typically show 
      pancreatic exocrine dysfunction. However, in the present case, which features 
      premature termination, there is no involvement of exocrine dysfunction, 
      potentially demonstrating a genotype-phenotype correlation.

TI  - Two New Mutations in the CEL Gene Causing Diabetes and Hereditary Pancreatitis: 
      How to Correctly Identify MODY8 Cases.
PG  - e1455-e1466
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgab864 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Maturity onset diabetes of the young, type 8 (MODY8) is associated with 
      mutations in the CEL gene, which encodes the digestive enzyme carboxyl ester 
      lipase. Several diabetes cases and families have in recent years been attributed 
      to mutations in CEL without any functional or clinical evidence provided. 
      OBJECTIVE: To facilitate correct MODY8 diagnostics, we screened 2 cohorts of 
      diabetes patients and delineated the phenotype. METHODS: Young, lean Swedish and 
      Finnish patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (352 cases, 406 controls) 
      were screened for mutations in the CEL gene. We also screened 58 Czech MODY cases 
      who had tested negative for common MODY genes. For CEL mutation-positive 
      subjects, family history was recorded, and clinical investigations and pancreatic 
      imaging performed. RESULTS: Two cases (1 Swedish and 1 Czech) with germline 
      mutation in CEL were identified. Clinical and radiological investigations of 
      these 2 probands and their families revealed dominantly inherited 
      insulin-dependent diabetes, pancreatic exocrine dysfunction, and atrophic 
      pancreas with lipomatosis and cysts. Notably, hereditary pancreatitis was the 
      predominant phenotype in 1 pedigree. Both families carried single-base pair 
      deletions in the proximal part of the CEL variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) 
      region in exon 11. The mutations are predicted to lead to aberrant protein tails 
      that make the CEL protein susceptible to aggregation. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis 
      of MODY8 requires a pancreatic exocrine phenotype and a deletion in the CEL VNTR 
      in addition to dominantly inherited diabetes. CEL screening may be warranted also 
      in families with hereditary pancreatitis of unknown genetic etiology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The carboxyl-ester lipase (CEL) gene contains a variable number of 
      tandem repeats (VNTR) region. It remains unclear whether the number of repeats in 
      the CEL VNTR is related to the risk of pancreatic diseases. The aim of this study 
      was to investigate whether CEL VNTR length is associated with idiopathic chronic 
      pancreatitis (ICP), alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (ACP), or pancreatic cancer in 
      a cohort of Chinese patients. METHODS: CEL VNTRs were genotyped in patients 
      diagnosed with ICP (n = 771), ACP (n = 222), or pancreatic cancer (n = 263), and 
      in healthy controls (n = 927). CEL VNTR lengths were determined using a screening 
      method combining PCR and DNA fragment analysis. RESULTS: Overall, the CEL VNTR 
      lengths ranged from 5 to 22 repeats, with the 16-repeat allele ('normal' size, N) 
      accounting for 73.82% of all observed alleles. The VNTR allele frequencies and 
      genotype distributions were not significantly different between healthy controls 
      and patients with ACP or pancreatic cancer. For the ICP group, allele frequencies 
      did not differ significantly from the controls, while the frequency of the SS 
      genotype (homozygosity for 5-15 repeats) was significantly higher in the patients 
      (4.67%) than in the controls (1.94%) (p = 0.0014; OR = 2.47; 95% CI = 1.39-4.39). 
      CONCLUSIONS: There were no associations between the CEL VNTR length and ACP or 
      pancreatic cancer. However, homozygosity for short VNTR lengths may confer 
      susceptibility to ICP.

AB  - Data on the association between chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell kinetics 
      and patient outcome in the nontrial setting are missing, mainly due to the lack 
      of broadly available CAR-T-cell diagnostic quantification tools. We performed 
      prospective quantification of axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) in 21 patients 
      treated for aggressive B-cell lymphoma at our clinic. Median peak CAR-T-cell 
      count was 16.14 CAR-T cells/microL. Patients with 16.14/muL or higher peak CAR-T cells 
      (strong expanders) had more day-30 objective responses (91% vs 40%, P = .02). In 
      univariate analysis, peak CAR-T cell >/= 16.14 (P < .001), normal platelet counts 
      at start of lymphodepletion (P < .001), no prior stem cell transplant (P = .04), 
      and peak CAR-T cells as continuous variable (P = .03) were associated with better 
      progression-free survival (PFS). After adjusting for platelet counts and prior 
      stem cell transplantation, peak CAR-T cells below median was still associated 
      with shorter PFS (relative risk, 0.15, 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.59, P = 
      .007). Low platelet counts also maintained significant impact on PFS. Our data 
      demonstrate association of axi-cel levels and outcome in a nontrial setting and 
      for the first time use a cutoff to segregate weak and strong expanders with 
      respective outcomes.

AB  - Variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) sequences in the genome can have 
      functional consequences that contribute to human disease. This is the case for 
      the CEL gene, which is specifically expressed in pancreatic acinar cells and 
      encodes the digestive enzyme carboxyl ester lipase. Rare single-base deletions 
      (DELs) within the first (DEL1) or fourth (DEL4) VNTR segment of CEL cause 
      maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 8 (MODY8), an inherited disorder 
      characterized by exocrine pancreatic dysfunction and diabetes. Studies on the 
      DEL1 variant have suggested that MODY8 is initiated by CEL protein misfolding and 
      aggregation. However, it is unclear how the position of single-base deletions 
      within the CEL VNTR affects pathogenic properties of the protein. Here, we 
      investigated four naturally occurring CEL variants, arising from single-base 
      deletions in different VNTR segments (DEL1, DEL4, DEL9, and DEL13). When the four 
      variants were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, only DEL1 and DEL4 
      led to significantly reduced secretion, increased intracellular aggregation, and 
      increased endoplasmic reticulum stress compared with normal CEL protein. The 
      level of O-glycosylation was affected in all DEL variants. Moreover, all variants 
      had enzymatic activity comparable with that of normal CEL. We conclude that the 
      longest aberrant protein tails, resulting from single-base deletions in the 
      proximal VNTR segments, have highest pathogenic potential, explaining why DEL1 
      and DEL4 but not DEL9 and DEL13 have been observed in patients with MODY8. These 
      findings further support the view that CEL mutations cause pancreatic disease 
      through protein misfolding and proteotoxicity, leading to endoplasmic reticulum 
      stress and activation of the unfolded protein response.

TI  - Length of Variable Numbers of Tandem Repeats in the Carboxyl Ester Lipase (CEL) 
      Gene May Confer Susceptibility to Alcoholic Liver Cirrhosis but Not Alcoholic 
      Chronic Pancreatitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carboxyl-ester lipase (CEL) contributes to fatty acid ethyl ester 
      metabolism, which is implicated in alcoholic pancreatitis. The CEL gene harbours 
      a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) region in exon 11. Variation in this 
      VNTR has been linked to monogenic pancreatic disease, while conflicting results 
      were reported for chronic pancreatitis (CP). Here, we aimed to investigate a 
      potential association of CEL VNTR lengths with alcoholic CP. METHODS: Overall, 
      395 alcoholic CP patients, 218 patients with alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC) 
      serving as controls with a comparable amount of alcohol consumed, and 327 healthy 
      controls from Germany and the United Kingdom (UK) were analysed by determination 
      of fragment lengths by capillary electrophoresis. Allele frequencies and 
      genotypes of different VNTR categories were compared between the groups. RESULTS: 
      Twelve repeats were overrepresented in UK ACP patients (P = 0.04) compared to 
      controls, whereas twelve repeats were enriched in German ALC compared to 
      alcoholic CP patients (P = 0.03). Frequencies of CEL VNTR lengths of 14 and 15 
      repeats differed between German ALC patients and healthy controls (P = 0.03 and 
      0.008, respectively). However, in the genotype and pooled analysis of VNTR 
      lengths no statistical significant association was depicted. Additionally, the 
      16-16 genotype as well as 16 repeats were more frequent in UK ALC than in 
      alcoholic CP patients (P = 0.034 and 0.02, respectively). In all other 
      calculations, including pooled German and UK data, allele frequencies and 
      genotype distributions did not differ significantly between patients and controls 
      or between alcoholic CP and ALC. CONCLUSIONS: We did not obtain evidence that CEL 
      VNTR lengths are associated with alcoholic CP. However, our results suggest that 
      CEL VNTR lengths might associate with ALC, a finding that needs to be clarified 
      in larger cohorts.

TI  - A Carboxyl Ester Lipase (CEL) Mutant Causes Chronic Pancreatitis by Forming 
      Intracellular Aggregates That Activate Apoptosis.
PG  - 23224-23236
AB  - Patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) frequently have genetic risk factors for 
      disease. Many of the identified genes have been connected to trypsinogen 
      activation or trypsin inactivation. The description of CP in patients with 
      mutations in the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) domain of carboxyl ester 
      lipase (CEL) presents an opportunity to study the pathogenesis of CP 
      independently of trypsin pathways. We tested the hypothesis that a deletion and 
      frameshift mutation (C563fsX673) in the CEL VNTR causes CP through proteotoxic 
      gain-of-function activation of maladaptive cell signaling pathways including cell 
      death pathways. HEK293 or AR42J cells were transfected with constructs expressing 
      CEL with 14 repeats in the VNTR (CEL14R) or C563fsX673 CEL (CEL maturity onset 
      diabetes of youth with a deletion mutation in the VNTR (MODY)). In both cell 
      types, CEL MODY formed intracellular aggregates. Secretion of CEL MODY was 
      decreased compared with that of CEL14R. Expression of CEL MODY increased 
      endoplasmic reticulum stress, activated the unfolded protein response, and caused 
      cell death by apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that disorders of protein 
      homeostasis can lead to CP and suggest that novel therapies to decrease the 
      intracellular accumulation of misfolded protein may be successful in some 
      patients with CP.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: We have recently described copy number variants (CNVs) of 
      the human carboxyl-ester lipase (CEL) gene, including a recombined deletion 
      allele (CEL-HYB) that is a genetic risk factor for chronic pancreatitis. 
      Associations with pancreatic disease have also been reported for the variable 
      number of tandem repeat (VNTR) region located in CEL exon 11. Here, we examined 
      if CEL CNVs and VNTR length polymorphisms affect the risk for developing 
      pancreatic cancer. METHODS: CEL CNVs and VNTR were genotyped in a German family 
      with non-alcoholic chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, in 265 German and 
      197 Norwegian patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and in 882 
      controls. CNV screening was performed using PCR assays followed by agarose gel 
      electrophoresis whereas VNTR lengths were determined by DNA fragment analysis. 
      RESULTS: The investigated family was CEL-HYB-positive. However, an association of 
      CEL-HYB or a duplication CEL allele with pancreatic cancer was not seen in our 
      two patient cohorts. The frequency of the 23-repeat VNTR allele was borderline 
      significant in Norwegian cases compared to controls (1.2% vs. 0.3%; P = 0.05). 
      For all other VNTR lengths, no statistically significant difference in frequency 
      was observed. Moreover, no association with pancreatic cancer was detected when 
      CEL VNTR lengths were pooled into groups of short, normal or long alleles. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We could not demonstrate an association between CEL CNVs and 
      pancreatic cancer. An association is also unlikely for CEL VNTR lengths, although 
      analyses in larger materials are necessary to completely exclude an effect of 
      rare VNTR alleles.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in the last exon of 
      the carboxyl-ester lipase (CEL) gene has been reported to associate with 
      alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis (ACP) in a Japanese study. Here, we have 
      investigated the association between the number of CEL VNTR repeats and ACP or 
      idiopathic chronic pancreatitis (ICP) in a cohort of German patients. METHODS: 
      Patients diagnosed with ACP (n = 203) or ICP (n = 64) were genotyped using a 
      screening method consisting of PCR followed by DNA fragment analysis. The allele 
      frequencies of different CEL VNTR lengths were compared to the frequencies in 
      healthy controls (n = 390). RESULTS: We observed no statistical significant 
      associations between CEL VNTR allele frequencies and ACP or ICP. CONCLUSION: This 
      study did not find evidence that supported an association between the common 
      length variations of the CEL VNTR and chronic pancreatitis.

TI  - Diabetes and pancreatic exocrine dysfunction due to mutations in the carboxyl

      misfolding disease.
PG  - 34593-605
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M111.222679 [doi]
AB  - CEL-maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), diabetes with pancreatic 
      lipomatosis and exocrine dysfunction, is due to dominant frameshift mutations in 
      the acinar cell carboxyl ester lipase gene (CEL). As Cel knock-out mice do not 
      express the phenotype and the mutant protein has an altered and intrinsically 
      disordered tandem repeat domain, we hypothesized that the disease mechanism might 
      involve a negative effect of the mutant protein. In silico analysis showed that 
      the pI of the tandem repeat was markedly increased from pH 3.3 in wild-type (WT) 
      to 11.8 in mutant (MUT) human CEL. By stably overexpressing CEL-WT and CEL-MUT in 
      HEK293 cells, we found similar glycosylation, ubiquitination, constitutive 
      secretion, and quality control of the two proteins. The CEL-MUT protein 
      demonstrated, however, a high propensity to form aggregates found intracellularly 
      and extracellularly. Different physicochemical properties of the intrinsically 
      disordered tandem repeat domains of WT and MUT proteins may contribute to 
      different short and long range interactions with the globular core domain and 
      other macromolecules, including cell membranes. Thus, we propose that CEL-MODY is 
      a protein misfolding disease caused by a negative gain-of-function effect of the 
      mutant proteins in pancreatic tissues.

TI  - Mutations in the VNTR of the carboxyl-ester lipase gene (CEL) are a rare cause of 
      monogenic diabetes.
PG  - 55-64
LID - 10.1007/s00439-009-0740-8 [doi]
AB  - We have previously shown that heterozygous single-base deletions in the 
      carboxyl-ester lipase (CEL) gene cause exocrine and endocrine pancreatic 
      dysfunction in two multigenerational families. These deletions were found in the 
      first and fourth repeats of a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), which has 
      proven challenging to sequence due to high GC-content and considerable length 
      variation. We have therefore developed a screening method consisting of a 
      multiplex PCR followed by fragment analysis. The method detected putative 
      disease-causing insertions and deletions in the proximal repeats of the VNTR, and 
      determined the VNTR-length of each allele. When blindly testing 56 members of the 
      two families with known single-base deletions in the CEL VNTR, the method 
      correctly assessed the mutation carriers. Screening of 241 probands from 
      suspected maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) families negative for 
      mutations in known MODY genes (95 individuals from Denmark and 146 individuals 
      from UK) revealed no deletions in the proximal repeats of the CEL VNTR. However, 
      we found one Danish patient with a short, novel CEL allele containing only three 
      VNTR repeats (normal range 7-23 in healthy controls). This allele co-segregated 
      with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance in the patient's family as six of 
      seven mutation carriers were affected. We also identified individuals who had 
      three copies of a complete CEL VNTR. In conclusion, the CEL gene is highly 
      polymorphic, but mutations in CEL are likely to be a rare cause of monogenic 
      diabetes.

TI  - Mutations in the CEL VNTR cause a syndrome of diabetes and pancreatic exocrine 
      dysfunction.
PG  - 54-62
AB  - Dysfunction of the exocrine pancreas is observed in diabetes, but links between 
      concurrent exocrine and endocrine pancreatic disease and contributing genetic 
      factors are poorly characterized. We studied two families with diabetes and 
      exocrine pancreatic dysfunction by genetic, physiological and in vitro functional 
      studies. A genome-wide screen in Family 1 linked diabetes to chromosome 9q34 
      (maximal lod score 5.07). Using fecal elastase deficiency as a marker of exocrine 
      pancreatic dysfunction refined the critical chromosomal region to 1.16 Mb 
      (maximal lod score 11.6). Here, we identified a single-base deletion in the 
      variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR)-containing exon 11 of the carboxyl ester 
      lipase (CEL) gene, a major component of pancreatic juice and responsible for the 
      duodenal hydrolysis of cholesterol esters. Screening subjects with maturity-onset 
      diabetes of the young identified Family 2, with another single-base deletion in 
      CEL and a similar phenotype with beta-cell failure and pancreatic exocrine 
      disease. The in vitro catalytic activities of wild-type and mutant CEL protein 
      were comparable. The mutant enzyme was, however, less stable and secreted at a 
      lower rate. Furthermore, we found some evidence for an association between common 
      insertions in the CEL VNTR and exocrine dysfunction in a group of 182 unrelated 
      subjects with diabetes (odds ratio 4.2 (1.6, 11.5)). Our findings link diabetes 
      to the disrupted function of a lipase in the pancreatic acinar cells.

TI  - Carboxylester lipase gene polymorphism as a risk of alcohol-induced pancreatitis.
PG  - e87-91
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Alcohol abuse causes pancreatic damage in humans. However, only 5% of 
      alcoholic patients have a clinical manifestation of pancreatitis, and the genetic 
      predisposition of alcohol-associated pancreatitis remains elusive. Nonoxidative 
      metabolites of ethanol, fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), might play an important 
      role in pancreatic damage. Carboxylester lipase (CEL) has been known to catalyze 
      FAEE synthesis from fatty acids and ethanol. METHODS: The variable number of 
      tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in the coding region of the CEL gene was 
      studied in patients with alcoholic pancreatitis (n = 100), in alcoholics without 
      pancreatitis (n = 52), in patients with nonalcoholic pancreatitis (n = 50), in 
      hyperlipidemia patients (n = 96), and control subjects (n = 435). RESULTS: The 
      frequency of the NN-type (wild-type) gene was significantly decreased in patients 
      with alcoholic pancreatitis than in other groups. The frequency of subjects who 
      had the L allele in patients with alcoholic pancreatitis was significantly higher 
      than in other groups. The distribution of the CEL gene polymorphism was not 
      different among the control subjects, alcoholics without pancreatitis, patients 
      with nonalcoholic pancreatitis, and patients with hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The CEL gene polymorphism, especially an increase in the frequency of the L 
      allele, was found to be associated with alcohol-induced pancreatitis.
