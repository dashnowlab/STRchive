AB  - Short tandem repeats (STRs) are common variations in human genomes that 
      frequently expand or contract, causing genetic disorders, mainly when expanded. 
      Traditional diagnostic methods for identifying these expansions, such as 
      repeat-primed PCR and Southern blotting, are often labor-intensive, 
      locus-specific, and are unable to precisely determine long repeat expansions. 
      Sequencing-based methods, although capable of genome-wide detection, are limited 
      by inaccuracy (short-read technologies) and high associated costs (long-read 
      technologies). This study evaluated optical genome mapping (OGM) as an efficient, 
      accurate approach for measuring STR lengths and assessing somatic stability in 85 
      samples with known pathogenic repeat expansions in DMPK, CNBP, and RFC1, causing 
      myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 and cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and 
      vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), respectively. Three workflows-manual de 
      novo assembly, local guided assembly (local-GA), and a molecule distance 
      script-were applied, of which the latter two were developed as part of this study 
      to assess the repeat sizes and somatic repeat stability. OGM successfully 
      identified 84/85 (98.8%) of the pathogenic expansions, distinguishing between 
      wild-type and expanded alleles or between two expanded alleles in recessive 
      cases, with greater accuracy than standard of care (SOC) for long repeats and no 
      apparent upper size limit. Notably, OGM detected somatic instability in a subset 
      of DMPK, CNBP, and RFC1 samples. These findings suggest OGM could advance 
      diagnostic accuracy for large repeat expansions, providing a more comprehensive 
      genome-wide assay for repeat expansion disorders by measuring exact repeat 
      lengths and somatic instability across multiple loci simultaneously.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Diagnostic possibilities for myotonic dystrophy type 2 
      (DM2) are constantly evolving in order to achieve more accurate and faster 
      diagnosis. Whole genome sequencing (WGS), together with specialized tandem repeat 
      (TR) genotyping bioinformatic tools, represent a breakthrough technology in 
      molecular diagnostics. We decided to characterize new opportunities and 
      challenges in WGS-based DM2 molecular diagnostics. METHODS: WGS data were 
      obtained from 50 individuals, including five DM2 patients, and one individual 
      carrying a premutation range allele. TR characterization was performed using a 
      modified version of the Dante tool, with results validated by conventional PCR 
      and repeat-primed PCR. RESULTS: We used WGS to identify all of the 
      expansion-range DM2 alleles, together with the premutation-range allele. Compared 
      to conventional methods, WGS was more efficient for a detailed sequence structure 
      characterization of the normal-range alleles, and phasing of the entire 
      CNBP-complex motif. A 97 % genotyping concordance rate was achieved between the 
      conventional methods and the WGS-derived results, with discrepancies mainly based 
      on single-repeat differences in the genotypes. The stutter effect introduced some 
      uncertainty in both methods. CONCLUSION: Short-read WGS offers significant 
      potential for DM2 diagnostics by enabling precise repeat motif characterization 
      and may also apply to other tandem repeat disorders (TRDs).

TI  - Updated Structure of CNBP Repeat Expansions in Patients With Myotonic Dystrophy 
      Type 2 and Its Implication for Standard Diagnostics.
PG  - e200220
LID - 10.1212/NXG.0000000000200220 [doi]
LID - e200220
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is a multisystemic 
      repeat disorder caused by the expansion of an unstable CCTG tetranucleotide 
      repeat in the noncoding region of the CNBP gene. Standard diagnostic is based on 
      Southern blot analysis or a unidirectional RP-PCR that amplifies the repeat from 
      the downstream end. METHODS: Our study reevaluated 80 patients (cohort 1) with 
      clinical suspicion of DM2 but homozygous negative results using the standard 
      diagnostic repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). Reanalysis was performed using a second 
      RP-PCR that amplifies the repeat from the opposite direction. Individual samples 
      were further analyzed by Oxford Nanopore Technology long-read sequencing, Sanger 
      sequencing, and another RP-PCR. In addition, repeat expansions were further 
      characterized in 168 patients with confirmed DM2 (cohort 2). RESULTS: We 
      identified 5 of the 80 patients (cohort 1) with expanded repeats in CNBP and, as 
      such, reclassified them as positive for DM2. The initial false-negative results 
      were attributed to variants within the primer binding site of the standard RP-PCR 
      in one patient and an additional novel (TCTG)(n) repeat downstream to the known 
      (CCTG)(n) repeat in 4 other patients. By analyzing a cohort of 168 patients with 
      confirmed DM2 (cohort 2), we found that the additional (TCTG)(n) repeat is 
      present in at least 84% of patients. DISCUSSION: Our study revealed the presence 
      of an additional repeat (TCTG)(n) in most of the patients living with DM2. Large 
      expansions of this repeat likely hinder sufficient amplification of the disease 
      causing (CCTG)(n) repeat. Because the (TCTG)(n) repeat is likely mosaic in 
      length, (CCTG)(n) repeat expansions are correctly detected in most patients. 
      However, a few patients are at risk of a false-negative result using the standard 
      RP-PCR, which had a false-negative rate of 0.7% (5/674) and a sensitivity of 
      97.3% in the cohort studied. Based on our findings, we propose 
      (TG)(v)(TCTG)(w)(CCTG)(n)(TCTG')(m) as the updated model for the structure of 
      CNBP repeat expansions and recommend adapting the diagnostic guidelines 
      accordingly. The effect of the (TCTG)(n) repeat on the phenotype remains to be 
      determined but could be key for establishing a phenotype-genotype correlation for 
      DM2 that remained elusive so far.

TI  - Life expectancy and causes of death in patients with Myotonic Dystrophy Type 2.
PG  - 1221-1228
LID - 10.3233/JND-240089 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myotonic Dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is a dominantly inherited multisystem 
      disease caused by a CCTG repeat expansion in intron 1 of the CNBP gene. Although 
      in the last two decades over 1500 patients with DM2 have been diagnosed 
      worldwide, our clinical impression of a reduced life expectancy in DM2 has not 
      been investigated previously. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this observational study was 
      to determine the life expectancy and the causes of death in patients with 
      genetically confirmed DM2. METHODS: We identified the data of all deceased 
      patients with DM2 in the Dutch neuromuscular database between 2000 and 2023. Ages 
      and causes of death and the patients' clinical features during lifetime were 
      determined. Age of death in DM2 was compared to the general population by using 
      life tables with prognostic cohort life expectancy (CLE) and period life 
      expectancy (PLE) data of the Dutch electronic database of statistics (CBS 
      StatLine). RESULTS: Twenty-six deceased patients were identified in the Dutch DM2 
      cohort (n = 125). Median age of death in DM2 (70.9 years) was significantly lower 
      compared to sex- and age-matched CLE (78.1 years) and PLE (82.1 years) in the 
      Netherlands. Main causes of death were cardiac diseases (31%) and pneumonia 
      (27%). Seven patients (27%) had a malignancy at the time of death. CONCLUSION: 
      These results provide new insights into the phenotype of DM2. Life expectancy in 
      patients with DM2 is reduced, possibly attributable to multiple causes including 
      increased risk of cardiac disease, pneumonia, and malignancies. The occurrence of 
      a significantly reduced life expectancy has implications for clinical practice 
      and may form a basis for advanced care planning, including end-of-life care, to 
      optimize quality of life for patients with DM2 and their family. Research in 
      larger cohorts should be done to confirm these findings and to ascertain more 
      about the natural course in DM2.

TI  - Co-occurrence of CAPN3 homozygous mutation and CCTG expansion in the CNBP gene in 
      a patient with muscular dystrophy.
PG  - 109-114
LID - 10.5114/ppn.2024.141382 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Muscular dystrophy is a group of heterogeneous diseases causing 
      progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Many types have been defined, including 
      Duchenne/Becker, myotonic, limb-girdle, congenital, and facioscapulohumeral 
      muscular dystrophies. This study aims to present the first patient with both a 
      homozygous CAPN3 mutation and a CCTG expansion in the CNBP gene, which suggests 
      the co-occurrence of two diseases in a single patient. CASE DESCRIPTION: 
      Homozygous pathogenic variant c.550delA (p.Thr184ArgfsTer36) in the CAPN3 gene, 
      as well as a heterozygous expansion of a CCTG repeat of the CNBP gene, were 
      identified in a single patient. Segregation analysis showed both maternal and 
      paternal heterozygous carriers for CAPN3 mutation, and a maternally inherited 
      CNBP expansion. COMMENT: In general, the co-occurrence of two diseases in a 
      single patient is considered as uncommon, although possible, and therefore it 
      should be taken into consideration in the populations with a relatively high 
      prevalence of myotonic dystrophy type 2.

TI  - Effects of interrupting residues on DNA dumbbell structures formed by CCTG 
      tetranucleotide repeats associated with myotonic dystrophy type 2.
PG  - 2544-2556
LID - 10.1002/1873-3468.14952 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is a neurogenerative disease caused by 
      caprylic/capric triglyceride (CCTG) tetranucleotide repeat expansions in intron 1 
      of the cellular nucleic acid-binding protein (CNBP) gene. Non-B DNA structures 
      formed by CCTG repeats can promote genetic instability, whereas interrupting 
      motifs of NCTG (N = A/T/G) within CCTG repeats help to maintain genomic 
      stability. However, whether the interrupting motifs can affect DNA structures of 
      CCTG repeats remains unclear. Here, we report that four CCTG repeats with an 
      interrupting 3'-A/T/G residue formed dumbbell structures, whereas a 
      non-interrupting 3'-C residue resulted in a multi-loop structure exhibiting 
      conformational dynamics that may contribute to a higher tendency of escaping from 
      DNA mismatch repair and causing repeat expansions. The results provide new 
      structural insights into the genetic instability of CCTG repeats in DM2.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is a genetic disease caused by expanded CCTG DNA 
      repeats in the first intron of CNBP. The number of CCTG repeats in DM2 patients 
      ranges from 75 to 11,000, yet little is known about the molecular mechanisms 
      responsible for repeat expansions or contractions. We developed an experimental 
      system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that enables the selection of large-scale 
      contractions of (CCTG)100 within the intron of a reporter gene and subsequent 
      genetic analysis. Contractions exceeded 80 repeat units, causing the final 
      repetitive tract to be well below the threshold for disease. We found that Rad51 
      and Rad52 are involved in these massive contractions, indicating a mechanism that 
      uses homologous recombination. Srs2 helicase was shown previously to stabilize 
      CTG, CAG, and CGG repeats. Loss of Srs2 did not significantly affect CCTG 
      contraction rates in unperturbed conditions. In contrast, loss of the RecQ 
      helicase Sgs1 resulted in a 6-fold decrease in contraction rate with specific 
      evidence that helicase activity is required for large-scale contractions. Using a 
      genetic assay to evaluate chromosome arm loss, we determined that CCTG and 
      reverse complementary CAGG repeats elevate the rate of chromosomal fragility 
      compared to a short-track control. Overall, our results demonstrate that the 
      genetic control of CCTG repeat contractions is notably distinct among 
      disease-causing microsatellite repeat sequences.

AB  - Pathogenic short tandem repeat (STR) expansions cause over 20 neurodegenerative 
      diseases. To determine the contribution of STRs in sporadic amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), we used ExpansionHunter, 
      REviewer, and polymerase chain reaction validation to assess 21 neurodegenerative 
      disease-associated STRs in whole-genome sequencing data from 608 patients with 
      sporadic ALS, 68 patients with sporadic FTD, and 4703 matched controls. We also 
      propose a data-derived outlier detection method for defining allele thresholds in 
      rare STRs. Excluding C9orf72 repeat expansions, 17.6% of clinically diagnosed ALS 
      and FTD cases had at least one expanded STR allele reported to be pathogenic or 
      intermediate for another neurodegenerative disease. We identified and validated 
      162 disease-relevant STR expansions in C9orf72 (ALS/FTD), ATXN1 [spinal 
      cerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1)], ATXN2 (SCA2), ATXN8 (SCA8), TBP (SCA17), HTT 
      (Huntington's disease), DMPK [myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1)], CNBP (DM2), and 
      FMR1 (fragile-X disorders). Our findings suggest clinical and pathological 
      pleiotropy of neurodegenerative disease genes and highlight their importance in 
      ALS and FTD.

LID - 10.1101/2023.02.02.526846 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy is a multisystemic neuromuscular disease caused by either a 
      CTG repeat expansion in DMPK (DM1) or a CCTG repeat expansion in CNBP (DM2). 
      Transcription of the expanded alleles produces toxic gain-of-function RNA that 
      sequester the MBNL family of alternative splicing regulators into ribonuclear 
      foci, leading to pathogenic mis-splicing. There are currently no approved 
      treatments that target the root cause of disease which is the production of the 
      toxic expansion RNA molecules. In this study, using our previously established 
      HeLa DM1 repeat selective screening platform, we identified the natural product 
      quercetin as a selective modulator of toxic RNA levels. Quercetin treatment 
      selectively reduced toxic RNA levels and rescued MBNL dependent mis-splicing in 
      DM1 and DM2 patient derived cell lines and in the HSA(LR) transgenic DM1 mouse 
      model where rescue of myotonia was also observed. Based on our data and its 
      safety profile for use in humans, we have identified quercetin as a priority 
      disease-targeting therapeutic lead for clinical evaluation for the treatment of 
      DM1 and DM2.

TI  - Characterization of full-length CNBP expanded alleles in myotonic dystrophy type 
      2 patients by Cas9-mediated enrichment and nanopore sequencing.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.80229 [doi]
LID - e80229
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is caused by CCTG repeat expansions in the CNBP 
      gene, comprising 75 to >11,000 units and featuring extensive mosaicism, making it 
      challenging to sequence fully expanded alleles. To overcome these limitations, we 
      used PCR-free Cas9-mediated nanopore sequencing to characterize CNBP repeat 
      expansions at the single-nucleotide level in nine DM2 patients. The length of 
      normal and expanded alleles can be assessed precisely using this strategy, 
      agreeing with traditional methods, and revealing the degree of mosaicism. We also 
      sequenced an entire ~50 kbp expansion, which has not been achieved previously for 
      DM2 or any other repeat-expansion disorders. Our approach precisely counted the 
      repeats and identified the repeat pattern for both short interrupted and 
      uninterrupted alleles. Interestingly, in the expanded alleles, only two DM2 
      samples featured the expected pure CCTG repeat pattern, while the other seven 
      presented also TCTG blocks at the 3' end, which have not been reported before in 
      DM2 patients, but confirmed hereby with orthogonal methods. The demonstrated 
      approach simultaneously determines repeat length, structure/motif, and the extent 
      of somatic mosaicism, promising to improve the molecular diagnosis of DM2 and 
      achieve more accurate genotype-phenotype correlations for the better 
      stratification of DM2 patients in clinical trials.

      molecular tools. Methodological advances have made repeat expansion (RE) 
      detection with whole genome sequencing (WGS) feasible. We recruited a 
      multi-generational family (family A) ascertained for genetic studies of autism 
      spectrum disorder. WGS was performed on seven children from four nuclear families 
      from family A and analyzed for REs of STRs known to cause neurological disorders. 
      We detected an expansion of a heterozygous intronic CCTG STR in CNBP in two 
      siblings. This STR causes myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2). The expansion did not 
      segregate with the ASD phenotype. Repeat-primed PCR showed that the DM2 CCTG 
      motif was expanded above the pathogenic threshold in both children and their 
      mother. On subsequent examination, the mother had mild features of DM2. We show 
      that screening of STRs in WGS datasets has diagnostic utility, both in the 
      clinical and research domain, with potential management and genetic counseling 
      implications.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by expansions of C(C)TG repeats in the 
      non-coding regions of the DMPK and CNBP genes, and DM patients often suffer from 
      sudden cardiac death due to lethal conduction block or arrhythmia. Specific 
      molecular changes that underlie DM cardiac pathology have been linked to 
      repeat-associated depletion of Muscleblind-like (MBNL) 1 and 2 proteins and 
      upregulation of CUGBP, Elav-like family member 1 (CELF1). Hypothesis solely 
      targeting MBNL1 or CELF1 pathways that could address all the consequences of 
      repeat expansion in heart remained inconclusive, particularly when the direct 
      cause of mortality and results of transcriptome analyses remained undetermined in 
      Mbnl compound knockout (KO) mice with cardiac phenotypes. Here, we develop 
      Myh6-Cre double KO (DKO) (Mbnl1-/-; Mbnl2cond/cond; Myh6-Cre+/-) mice to 
      eliminate Mbnl1/2 in cardiomyocytes and observe spontaneous lethal cardiac events 
      under no anesthesia. RNA sequencing recapitulates DM heart spliceopathy and shows 
      gene expression changes that were previously undescribed in DM heart studies. 
      Notably, immunoblotting reveals a nearly 6-fold increase of Calsequestrin 1 and 
      50% reduction of epidermal growth factor proteins. Our findings demonstrate that 
      complete ablation of MBNL1/2 in cardiomyocytes is essential for generating sudden 
      death due to lethal cardiac rhythms and reveal potential mechanisms for DM heart 
      pathogenesis.

      2 Facilitates Degradation by RNA Quality Control Pathways.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is one of >40 microsatellite disorders caused by 
      RNA repeat expansions. The DM2 repeat expansion, r(CCUG)(exp) (where "exp" 
      denotes expanded repeating nucleotides), is harbored in intron 1 of the CCHC-type 
      zinc finger nucleic acid binding protein (CNBP). The expanded RNA repeat causes 
      disease by a gain-of-function mechanism, sequestering various RNA-binding 
      proteins including the pre-mRNA splicing regulator MBNL1. Sequestration of MBNL1 
      results in its loss-of-function and concomitant deregulation of the alternative 
      splicing of its native substrates. Notably, this r(CCUG)(exp) causes retention of 
      intron 1 in the mature CNBP mRNA. Herein, we report druglike small molecules that 
      bind the structure adopted by r(CCUG)(exp) and improve DM2-associated defects. 
      These small molecules were optimized from screening hits from an RNA-focused 
      small-molecule library to afford a compound that binds r(CCUG)(exp) specifically 
      and with nanomolar affinity, facilitates endogenous degradation of the aberrantly 
      retained intron in which it is harbored, and rescues alternative splicing 
      defects.

PG  - 715-722
LID - 10.3233/JND-210671 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is caused by a CCTG repeat expansion 
      in intron 1 of the CCHC-Type Zinc Finger Nucleic Acid Binding Protein (CNBP) 
      gene. Previous studies indicated that this repeat expansion originates from 
      separate founders. OBJECTIVE: This study was set out to determine whether or not 
      patients with DM2 originating from European and non-European countries carry the 
      previously described European founder haplotypes. METHODS: Haplotype analysis was 
      performed in 59 DM2 patients from 29 unrelated families. Twenty-three families 
      were from European descent and 6 families originated from non-European countries 
      (India, Suriname and Morocco). Seven short tandem repeats (CL3N122, CL3N99, 
      CL3N59, CL3N117, CL3N119, CL3N19 and CL3N23) and 4 single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNP) (rs1871922, rs1384313, rs4303883 and CGAP_886192) in and 
      around the CNBP gene were used to construct patients' haplotypes. These 
      haplotypes were compared to the known DM2 haplotypes to determine the ancestral 
      origin of the CNBP repeat expansion. RESULTS: Of 41 patients, the haplotype could 
      be assigned to the previously described Caucasian haplotypes. Three patients from 
      Morocco and Portugal had a haplotype identical to the earlier reported Moroccan 
      haplotype. Twelve patients from India and Suriname, however, carried a haplotype 
      that seems distinct from the previously reported haplotypes. Three individuals 
      could not be assigned to a specific haplotype. CONCLUSION: The ancestral origin 
      of DM2 in India might be distinct from the Caucasian families and the solely 
      described Japanese patient. However, we were unable to establish this firmly due 
      to the limited genetic variation in the region surrounding the CNBP gene.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a 
      (CCTG)n repeat expansion in intron 1 of the CNBP gene. In this article, we report 
      the clinicopathologic findings in 50 patients seen at a single site over a 27 
      year period. DM2 was the fifth most common type of muscular dystrophy seen at our 
      center with a 5-fold lower frequency as compared to DM1. Age of symptom onset 
      ranged from 15 to 72 years, and the mean duration between symptom onset and 
      diagnosis was 7.4 years. Weakness referable to the proximal lower extremities was 
      the presenting symptom in 62% of patients. The degree of generalized weakness 
      varied from severe in 30% to no weakness in 20% of patients. Clinical myotonia 
      was noted in 18% and myotonic discharges on electromyography in 97% of patients. 
      Pain symptoms were uncommon in our cohort. A significant correlation was noted 
      between limb weakness and degree of muscle pathologic changes. There was no 
      correlation between CCTG repeat size and other clinicopathologic findings. Six 
      patients (12%) had cardiac abnormalities including one who developed progressive 
      nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy ultimately leading to cardiac transplantation. 
      In 21 patients followed for 2 or more years, we noted a mean rate of decline in 
      total Medical Research Council score of about 1% per year.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is a genetically defined disease caused by a 
      toxic expanded repeat of r(CCUG) [r(CCUG)(exp)], harbored in intron 1 of 
      CCHC-type zinc-finger nucleic acid binding protein (CNBP) pre-mRNA. This 
      r(CCUG)(exp) causes toxicity via a gain-of-function mechanism, resulting in three 
      pathological hallmarks: aggregation into nuclear foci; sequestration of 
      muscleblind-like-1 (MBNL1) protein, leading to splicing defects; and retention of 
      CNBP intron 1. We studied two types of small molecules with different modes of 
      action, ones that simply bind and ones that are templated by r(CCUG)(exp) in 
      cells, i.e., the RNA synthesizes its own drug. Indeed, our studies completed in 
      DM2 patient-derived fibroblasts showed that the compounds disrupt the 
      r(CCUG)(exp)-MBNL1 complex, reduce intron retention, subjecting the liberated 
      intronic r(CCUG)(exp) to native decay pathways, and rescue other DM2-associated 
      cellular defects. Importantly, this study shows that small molecules can modulate 
      RNA biology by shunting toxic transcripts toward native decay pathways.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is a genetically defined muscular dystrophy that 
      is caused by an expanded repeat of r(CCUG) [r(CCUG)(exp)] in intron 1 of a 
      CHC-type zinc finger nucleic acid binding protein (CNBP) pre-mRNA. Various 
      mechanisms contribute to DM2 pathology including pre-mRNA splicing defects caused 
      by sequestration of the RNA splicing regulator muscleblind-like-1 (MBNL1) by 
      r(CCUG)(exp). Herein, we study the biological impacts of the molecular 
      recognition of r(CCUG)(exp)'s structure by a designer dimeric small molecule that 
      directly cleaves the RNA in patient-derived cells. The compound is comprised of 
      two RNA-binding modules conjugated to a derivative of the natural product 
      bleomycin. Careful design of the chimera affords RNA-specific cleavage, as 
      attachment of the bleomycin cleaving module was done in a manner that disables 
      DNA cleavage. The chimeric cleaver is more potent than the parent binding 
      compound for alleviating DM2-associated defects. Importantly, oligonucleotides 
      targeting the r(CCUG)(exp) sequence for cleavage exacerbate DM2 defects due to 
      recognition of a short r(CCUG) sequence that is embedded in CNBP, argonaute-1 
      (AGO1), and MBNL1, reducing their levels. The latter event causes a greater 
      depletion of functional MBNL1 than the amount already sequestered by 
      r(CCUG)(exp). Thus, compounds targeting RNA structures can have functional 
      advantages over oligonucleotides that target the sequence in some disease 
      settings, particularly in DM2.

TI  - Myotonic Dystrophy-2: Unusual Phenotype Due to a Small CCTG-expansion.
PG  - 39-43
LID - 10.2478/bjmg-2018-0024 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (MD2) is a multisystem disease, predominantly affecting 
      the proximal limb muscles, eyes, endocrine organs, heart and intestines. Longterm 
      asymptomatic creatine kinase (hyper-CKemia) of more than 20 years duration, in 
      association with hyperlipidemia and diabetes, as a manifestation of MD2 has not 
      been reported. A 52-year-old female with a history of hyper-CKemia since the age 
      of 32 years associated with diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hyperuricemia, developed 
      anginal chest pain and proximal muscle weakness together with clinical myotonia 
      when opening the fists at age 51 years. Examination revealed a left anterior 
      hemiblock, sensorimotor neuropathy, extensive myotonic discharges on needle 
      electromyography (EMG) and a CCTG-expansion of 134 bp on the ZNF9 gene. The 
      family history was positive for hyper-CKemia and muscle weakness. In addition, 
      over the previous years, she had developed vesico-ureteral reflux, cutaneous 
      melanoma, renal cysts, cervix dysplasias, thrombocytosis, cataracts, arterial 
      hypertension, heterozygous Factor V Leiden mutation, cholecystolithiasis, 
      multiple ovarial cysts and vitamin D deficiency. Asymptomatic, long-term 
      hyper-CKemia in association with multisystem disease should raise the suspicion 
      of a MD2. Rare manifestations of MD2 may be thrombocytosis, hyperuricemia, 
      vesico-ureteral reflux, gallstones, hypertension and cyst formation. In patients 
      with asymptomatic hyper-CKemia, needle EMG should be considered. Myotonic 
      dystrophy type 2 may take a mild course over many years if the CCTG-expansion is 
      short.

PG  - 601

LID - 601
AB  - Myotonic dystrophies (DM) are slowly progressing multisystemic disorders caused 
      by repeat expansions in the DMPK or CNBP genes. The multisystemic involvement in 
      DM patients often reflects the appearance of accelerated aging. This is partly 
      due to visible features such as cataracts, muscle weakness, and frontal baldness, 
      but there are also less obvious features like cardiac arrhythmia, diabetes or 
      hypogammaglobulinemia. These aging features suggest the hypothesis that DM could 
      be a segmental progeroid disease. To identify the molecular cause of this 
      characteristic appearance of accelerated aging we compare clinical features of DM 
      to "typical" segmental progeroid disorders caused by mutations in DNA repair or 
      nuclear envelope proteins. Furthermore, we characterize if this premature aging 
      effect is also reflected on the cellular level in DM and investigate overlaps 
      with "classical" progeroid disorders. To investigate the molecular similarities 
      at the cellular level we use primary DM and control cell lines. This analysis 
      reveals many similarities to progeroid syndromes linked to the nuclear envelope. 
      Our comparison on both clinical and molecular levels argues for qualification of 
      DM as a segmental progeroid disorder.

AB  - Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)-patient specific are an innovative 
      tool to reproduce a model of disease in vitro and summarize the pathological 
      phenotype and the disease etiopathology. Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is 
      caused by an unstable (CCTG)n expansion in intron 1 of the CNBP gene, leading to 
      a progressive multisystemic disease with muscle, heart and central nervous 
      dysfunctions. The pathogenesis of CNS involvement in DM2 is poorly understood 
      since no cellular or animal models fully recapitulate the molecular and clinical 
      neurodegenerative phenotype of patients. In this study, we generated for the 
      first time, two DM2 and two wild type hiPSC lines from dermal fibroblasts by 
      polycistronic lentiviral vector (hSTEMCCA-loxP) expressing OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and 
      cMYC genes and containing loxP-sites, excisable by Cre recombinase. Specific 
      morphological, molecular and immunocytochemical markers have confirmed the 
      stemness of DM2 and wild type-derived hiPSCs. These cells are able to 
      differentiate into neuronal population (NP) expressing tissue specific markers. 
      hiPSCs-derived NP cells maintain (CCTG)n repeat expansion and intranuclear RNA 
      foci exhibiting sequestration of MBNL1 protein, which are pathognomonic of the 
      disease. DM2 hiPSCs represent an important tool for the study of CNS pathogenesis 
      in patients, opening new perspectives for the development of cell-based therapies 
      in the field of personalized medicine and drug screening.

AB  - Autosomal dominant inherited Myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 2 (DM1 and DM2) are 
      the most frequent muscle dystrophies in the European population and are caused by 
      repeat expansion mutations. For Germany cumulative empiric evidence suggests an 
      estimated prevalence of DM2 of roughly 9 in 100,000, therefore being as prevalent 
      as DM1. In DM2, a (CCTG)(n) repeat tract located in the first intron of the CNBP 
      gene is expanded. The CCTG repeat tract is part of a complex repeat structure 
      comprising not only CCTG tetraplets but also repeated TG dinucleotides and TCTG 
      tetraplet elements as well as NCTG interruptions. Here, we provide the 
      distribution of normal sized alleles in the German population, which was found to 
      be highly similar to the Slovak population. Sequencing of 34 unexpanded healthy 
      range alleles in DM2 positive patients (heterozygous for a full expansion) 
      revealed that the CCTG repeat tract is usually interrupted by at least three 
      tetraplets which according to current opinion is supposed to render it stable 
      against expansion. Interestingly, only the largest analyzed normal allele had 23 
      uninterrupted CCTGs and consequently could represent an instable early 
      premutation allele. In our diagnostic history of DM2 cases, a total of 18 
      premutations were detected in 16 independent cases. Here, we describe two 
      premutation families, one with an expansion from a premutation allele and the 
      other with a contraction of a full expansion down to a premutation allele. Our 
      diagnostic results support the general assumption that the premutation range of 
      unstable CCTG stretches lies obviously between 25 and 75 CCTGs. However, the 
      clinical significance of premutation alleles is still unclear. In the light of 
      the two described families we suggest incomplete penetrance. Thus, as it was 
      proposed for other repeat expansion diseases (e.g., Huntington's disease), a 
      fluid transition of penetrance is more likely rather than a clear cut CCTG number 
      threshold.

AB  - Myotonic Dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is a multisystemic disorder associated with an 
      expanded [CCTG]n repeat in intron 1 of the CNBP gene. Epigenetic modifications 
      have been reported in many repeat expansion disorders, including myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1 (DM1), either as a mechanism to explain somatic repeat 
      instability or transcriptional alterations in disease genes. The purpose of our 
      work was to determine the effect of DM2 mutation on the methylation status of CpG 
      islands localized in the 5' promoter region and in the 3' end of the [CCTG]n 
      expansion of the CNBP gene. By bisulfite pyrosequencing, we characterized the 
      methylation profile of two different CpG islands within these regions, either in 
      whole blood and skeletal muscle tissues of DM2 patients (n=72 and n=7, 
      respectively) and controls (n=50 and n=7, respectively). Moreover, we compared 
      the relative mRNA transcript levels of CNBP gene in leukocytes and in skeletal 
      muscle tissues from controls and DM2 patients. We found that CpG sites located in 
      the promoter region showed hypomethylation, whereas CpG sites at 3' end of the 
      CCTG array are hypermethylated. Statistical analyses did not demonstrate any 
      significant differences in the methylation profile between DM2 patients and 
      controls in both tissues analyzed. According to the methylation analysis, CNBP 
      gene expression levels are not significantly altered in DM2 patients. These 
      results show that [CCTG]n repeat expansion, differently from the DM1 mutation, 
      does not influence the methylation status of the CNBP gene and suggest that other 
      molecular mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of DM2.

TI  - (CCUG)(n) RNA toxicity in a Drosophila model of myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) 
      activates apoptosis.
PG  - 993-1003
LID - 10.1242/dmm.026179 [doi]
AB  - The myotonic dystrophies are prototypic toxic RNA gain-of-function diseases. 
      Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2) are caused by different 
      unstable, noncoding microsatellite repeat expansions - (CTG)(DM1) in DMPK and 
      (CCTG)(DM2) in CNBP Although transcription of mutant repeats into (CUG)(DM1) or 
      (CCUG)(DM2) appears to be necessary and sufficient to cause disease, their 
      pathomechanisms remain incompletely understood. To study the mechanisms of 
      (CCUG)(DM2) toxicity and develop a convenient model for drug screening, we 
      generated a transgenic DM2 model in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster with 
      (CCUG)(n) repeats of variable length (n=16 and 106). Expression of noncoding 
      (CCUG)(106), but not (CCUG)(16), in muscle and retinal cells led to the formation 
      of ribonuclear foci and mis-splicing of genes implicated in DM pathology. 
      Mis-splicing could be rescued by co-expression of human MBNL1, but not by CUGBP1 
      (CELF1) complementation. Flies with (CCUG)(106) displayed strong disruption of 
      external eye morphology and of the underlying retina. Furthermore, expression of 
      (CCUG)(106) in developing retinae caused a strong apoptotic response. Inhibition 
      of apoptosis rescued the retinal disruption in (CCUG)(106) flies. Finally, we 
      tested two chemical compounds that have shown therapeutic potential in DM1 
      models. Whereas treatment of (CCUG)(106) flies with pentamidine had no effect, 
      treatment with a PKR inhibitor blocked both the formation of RNA foci and 
      apoptosis in retinae of (CCUG)(106) flies. Our data indicate that expression of 
      expanded (CCUG)(DM2) repeats is toxic, causing inappropriate cell death in 
      affected fly eyes. Our Drosophila DM2 model might provide a convenient tool for 
      in vivo drug screening.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A mild, slowly progressive course of proximal myotonic myopathy, also 
      known as myotonic dystrophy type 2, over years allowing the patient to continue 
      with extreme sport activity, has been only rarely reported. METHODS: Case report. 
      RESULTS: The patient is a 54-year-old female sport teacher who developed myotonia 
      of the distal upper limbs at the age of 32 years. Over the following 22 years, 
      myotonia spreaded to the entire musculature. Myotonia did not prevent her from 
      doing her job and from marathoning and improved with continuous exercise. 
      Additionally, she had developed hypothyroidism, ovarial cysts, incipient 
      cataract, motor neuropathy, hepatopathy, leukopenia, and mild hyper-CK-emia. A 
      heterozygous CCTG-repeat expansion of 500-9500 was found in the CNBP/ZNF9 gene. 
      At the age of 54 years, she was still performing sport, without presenting with 
      myotonia on clinical examination or having developed other typical manifestations 
      of proximal myotonic myopathy. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that proximal 
      myotonic myopathy may take a mild course over at least 22 years, that proximal 
      myotonic myopathy with mild myotonia may allow a patient to continue strenuous 
      sport activity, and that continuous physical activity may contribute to the mild 
      course of the disease.

TI  - Pseudouridine Modification Inhibits Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) Binding to CCUG 
      Repeats and Minimally Structured RNA through Reduced RNA Flexibility.
PG  - 4350-4357
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M116.770768 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 is a genetic neuromuscular disease caused by the 
      expression of expanded CCUG repeat RNAs from the non-coding region of the 
      CCHC-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein (CNBP) gene. These CCUG 
      repeats bind and sequester a family of RNA-binding proteins known as 
      Muscleblind-like 1, 2, and 3 (MBNL1, MBNL2, and MBNL3), and sequestration plays a 
      significant role in pathogenicity. MBNL proteins are alternative splicing 
      regulators that bind to the consensus RNA sequence YGCY (Y = pyrimidine). This 
      consensus sequence is found in the toxic RNAs (CCUG repeats) and in cellular RNA 
      substrates that MBNL proteins have been shown to bind. Replacing the uridine in 
      CCUG repeats with pseudouridine (Psi) resulted in a modest reduction of MBNL1 
      binding. Interestingly, Psi modification of a minimally structured RNA containing 
      YGCY motifs resulted in more robust inhibition of MBNL1 binding. The different 
      levels of inhibition between CCUG repeat and minimally structured RNA binding 
      appear to be due to the ability to modify both pyrimidines in the YGCY motif, 
      which is not possible in the CCUG repeats. Molecular dynamic studies of 
      unmodified and pseudouridylated minimally structured RNAs suggest that reducing 
      the flexibility of the minimally structured RNA leads to reduced binding by 
      MBNL1.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy types 1 (DM1) and 2 (DM2) are autosomal dominant, 
      microsatellite repeat expansion disorders that affect muscle function. Myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1 is caused by CTG repeat expansion in the 3' UTR region of the 
      DMPK gene. Patients with DM2 have expansion of CCTG repeats in intron 1 of the 
      CNBP gene. In this unit, we review and discuss the clinical phenotypes, genetic 
      mutations causing the diseases, and the molecular diagnostic approaches and tools 
      that are used to determine repeat sizes in DM1/2. In summary, the goal of this 
      chapter is to provide the reader with a basic understanding of the clinical, 
      genetic and diagnostic aspects of these disorders. (c) 2016 by John Wiley & Sons,

TI  - Identification of variants in MBNL1 in patients with a myotonic dystrophy-like 
      phenotype.
PG  - 1467-72
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2016.41 [doi]
AB  - The myotonic dystrophies (DMs) are the most common inherited muscular disorders 
      in adults. In most of the cases, the disease is caused by (CTG)n/(CCTG)n repeat 
      expansions (EXPs) in non-coding regions of the genes DMPK (dystrophia 
      myotonica-protein kinase) and CNBP (CCHC-type zinc-finger nucleic acid-binding 
      protein). The EXP is transcribed into mutant RNAs, which provoke a common 
      pathomechanism that is characterized by misexpression and mis-splicing. In this 
      study, we screened 138 patients with typical clinical features of DM being 
      negative for EXP in the known genes. We sequenced DMPK and CNBP - associated with 
      DM, as well as CELF1 (CUGBP, Elav-like family member 1) and MBNL1 
      (muscleblind-like splicing regulator 1) - associated with the pathomechanism of 
      DM, for pathogenic variants, addressing the question whether defects in other 
      genes could cause a DM-like phenotype. We identified variants in three unrelated 
      patients in the MBNL1 gene, two of them were heterozygous missense mutations and 
      one an in-frame deletion of three amino acids. The variants were located in 
      different conserved regions of the protein. The missense mutations were 
      classified as potentially pathogenic by prediction tools. Analysis of MBNL1 
      splice target genes was carried out for one of the patients using RNA from 
      peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL). Analysis of six genes known to show 
      mis-splicing in the skeletal muscle gave no informative results on the effect of 
      this variant when tested in PBL. The association of these variants with the DM 
      phenotype therefore remains unconfirmed, but we hope that in view of the key role 
      of MBNL1 in DM pathogenesis our observations may foster further studies in this 
      direction.

TI  - Optimization PCR for Detection CTG/CCTG-Repeat Expansions in the Diagnosis of 
      Myotonic Dystrophies.
PG  - 502-7
AB  - CONTEXT: Myotonic dystrophies (DMs) are a group of autosomal dominant 
      neuromuscular disorders which are caused by large CTG/CCTG-repeat expansions in 
      untranslated regions of DMPK/ZNF9 gene. The "phenotypic overlap" in DMs creates 
      complication in distinguishing patients with DM1 from patients with DM2 and 
      underscores the need for these patients to undergo genetic test; therefore, 
      detection and accurate sizing of the CTG/CCTG-repeat expansions are necessary. 
      Templates with long CTG/CCTG tandem repeats are difficult to amplify by 
      convention PCR. AIMS: The aim of our study was to develop an efficient, economic 
      amplification method which based on combination of primer design, modified 
      annealing, and extension conditions in PCR amplification. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: We 
      detected and analyzed the CTG-repeat expansions in patients having clinical, 
      electrophysiological, and muscle pathology features indicative of DMs by 
      optimization PCR. If no CTG-repeat expansions were detected, we subsequently 
      analyzed the CCTG-repeat expansions in the remaining patients. RESULTS: 42 
      participants included 25 DMs patients and 17 family members. 22 patients showed 
      CTG-repeat expansions, the CTG-repeat ranged from 53 to 683 and the average was 
      535; 3 patients showed CCTG-repeat expansions, the CCTG-repeat ranged from 400 to 
      450 and the average was 416. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular genetic tests are essential 
      for DMs diagnosis; Optimization PCR under the optimal conditions of primer 
      design, modified annealing, and extension conditions can be used for efficient 
      PCR in DMs diagnosis; Optimization PCR can greatly improve the positive detection 
      of DMs, provide an economic, accurate, and rapid method for routine diagnostic 
      use.

AB  - Eosinophilic myositis is characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of skeletal 
      muscles. In the absence of an identifiable causative factor or source (including 
      parasitic infection, intake of drugs or L-tryptophan, certain systemic disorders 
      as well as malignant diseases), the diagnosis of idiopathic eosinophilic myositis 
      is usually retained. However, some muscular dystrophies have been recently 
      identified in this subset of eosinophilic myositis. Here, we report a patient 
      with an 8 kb CCTG expansion in intron 1 of the CNBP gene, a mutation 
      characteristic of myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), whose first manifestation was 
      "idiopathic" eosinophilic myositis. This report suggests that in "idiopathic" 
      eosinophilic myositis, clinicians should consider muscular dystrophies, including 
      DM2.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is an autosomal dominant inherited 
      disorder with (CCTG)n repeat expansion in intron 1 of the CNBP gene. METHODS: We 
      studied the first 16 Greek DM2 patients who had undergone thorough evaluation. 
      RESULTS: The age at diagnosis ranged from 38 to 69 years. The initial symptoms 
      were proximal weakness, myalgias, and myotonia. Clinical myotonia was elicited in 
      10 patients, whereas electromyographic myotonic discharges were observed in 
      almost all patients. Subcapsular cataract was frequently present, but cardiac 
      arrhythmias were rare. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of Greek DM2 patients, proximal 
      weakness was the most common initial symptom. Myalgias were also reported in a 
      few patients, yet myotonia was not a major complaint. Although DM2 is considered 
      relatively benign, there are patients who may be affected severely. Thus, a high 
      index of suspicion must be maintained to make a timely diagnosis, especially in 
      those of reproductive age.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is a multisystemic disorder caused by a (CCTG)n 
      repeat expansion in intron 1 of CNBP. Transcription of the repeats causes a toxic 
      RNA gain of function involving their accumulation in ribonuclear foci. This leads 
      to sequestration of splicing factors and alters pre-mRNA splicing in a range of 
      downstream effector genes, which is thought to contribute to the diverse DM2 
      clinical features. Hyperlipidemia is frequent in DM2 patients, but the treatment 
      is problematic because of an increased risk of statin-induced adverse reactions. 
      Hypothesizing that shared pathways lead to the increased risk, we compared the 
      skeletal muscle expression profiles of DM2 patients and controls with patients 
      with hyperlipidemia on statin therapy. Neural precursor cell expressed, 
      developmentally downregulated-4 (NEDD4), an ubiquitin ligase, was one of the 
      dysregulated genes identified in DM2 patients and patients with statin-treated 
      hyperlipidemia. In DM2 muscle, NEDD4 mRNA was abnormally spliced, leading to 
      aberrant NEDD4 proteins. NEDD4 was down-regulated in persons taking statins, and 
      simvastatin treatment of C2C12 cells suppressed NEDD4 transcription. Phosphatase 
      and tensin homologue (PTEN), an established NEDD4 target, was increased and 
      accumulated in highly atrophic DM2 muscle fibers. PTEN ubiquitination was reduced 
      in DM2 myofibers, suggesting that the NEDD4-PTEN pathway is dysregulated in DM2 
      skeletal muscle. Thus, this pathway may contribute to the increased risk of 
      statin-adverse reactions in patients with DM2.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy is a progressive multisystem genetic disorder affecting about 
      1 in 8000 people worldwide. The unstable repeat expansions of (CTG)n or (CCTG)n 
      in the DMPK and ZNF9 genes cause the two known subtypes of myotonic dystrophy: 
      (i) myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and (ii) myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) 
      respectively. There is currently no cure but supportive management helps equally 
      to reduce the morbidity and mortality and patients need close follow up to pay 
      attention to their clinical problems. This review will focus on the clinical 
      features, molecular view and genetics, diagnosis and management of DM1.

TI  - The unstable CCTG repeat responsible for myotonic dystrophy type 2 originates

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is a subtype of the myotonic dystrophies, caused 
      by expansion of a tetranucleotide CCTG repeat in intron 1 of the zinc finger 
      protein 9 (ZNF9) gene. The expansions are extremely unstable and variable, 
      ranging from 75-11,000 CCTG repeats. This unprecedented repeat size and somatic 
      heterogeneity make molecular diagnosis of DM2 difficult, and yield variable 
      clinical phenotypes. To better understand the mutational origin and instability 
      of the ZNF9 CCTG repeat, we analyzed the repeat configuration and flanking 
      regions in 26 primate species. The 3'-end of an AluSx element, flanked by target 
      site duplications (5'-ACTRCCAR-3'or 5'-ACTRCCARTTA-3'), followed the CCTG repeat, 
      suggesting that the repeat was originally derived from the Alu element insertion. 
      In addition, our results revealed lineage-specific repetitive motifs: pyrimidine 
      (CT)-rich repeat motifs in New World monkeys, dinucleotide (TG) repeat motifs in 
      Old World monkeys and gibbons, and dinucleotide (TG) and tetranucleotide (TCTG 
      and/or CCTG) repeat motifs in great apes and humans. Moreover, these di- and 
      tetra-nucleotide repeat motifs arose from the poly (A) tail of the AluSx element, 
      and evolved into unstable CCTG repeats during primate evolution. Alu elements are 
      known to be the source of microsatellite repeats responsible for two other repeat 
      expansion disorders: Friedreich ataxia and spinocerebellar ataxia type 10. Taken 
      together, these findings raise questions as to the mechanism(s) by which 
      Alu-mediated repeats developed into the large, extremely unstable expansions 
      common to these three disorders.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant, multisystem disorder that is 
      characterized by myotonic myopathy. The symptoms and severity of myotonic 
      dystrophy type l (DM1) ranges from severe and congenital forms, which frequently 
      result in death because of respiratory deficiency, through to late-onset baldness 
      and cataract. In adult patients, cardiac conduction abnormalities may occur and 
      cause a shorter life span. In subsequent generations, the symptoms in DM1 may 
      present at an earlier age and have a more severe course (anticipation). In 
      myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), no anticipation is described, but cardiac 
      conduction abnormalities as in DM1 are observed and patients with DM2 
      additionally have muscle pain and stiffness. Both DM1 and DM2 are caused by 
      unstable DNA repeats in untranslated regions of different genes: A (CTG)n repeat 
      in the 3'-UTR of the DMPK gene and a (CCTG)n repeat in intron 1 of the CNBP 
      (formerly ZNF9) gene, respectively. The length of the (CTG)n repeat expansion in 
      DM1 correlates with disease severity and age of onset. Nevertheless, these repeat 
      sizes have limited predictive values on individual bases. Because of the disease 
      characteristics in DM1 and DM2, appropriate molecular testing and reporting is 
      very important for the optimal counseling in myotonic dystrophy. Here, we 
      describe best practice guidelines for clinical molecular genetic analysis and 
      reporting in DM1 and DM2, including presymptomatic and prenatal testing.

TI  - A role for PLCbeta1 in myotonic dystrophies type 1 and 2.
PG  - 3042-8
LID - 10.1096/fj.11-200337 [doi]
AB  - Phosphoinositide-phospholipase C beta1 (PLCbeta1) plays a crucial role in the 
      initiation of the genetic program responsible for muscle differentiation. We 
      previously demonstrated that nuclear PLCbeta1 activates the cyclin D3 promoter 
      during the differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes, indicating that PLCbeta1 is 
      essential for cyclin D3 promoter activation and gene transcription, through 
      c-jun/AP1. Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is the most prevalent form of muscular 
      dystrophy in adults. DM type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2) are dominantly inherited 
      multisystem disorders. DM1 is triggered by the pathological expansion of a 
      (CTG)(n) triplet repeat in the gene coding for DMPK, the dystrophia 
      myotonica-protein kinase, whereas a (CCTG)(n) tetranucleotide repeat expansion in 
      the ZNF9 gene, encoding a CCHC-type zinc finger protein, causes DM2. We found 
      that, unlike in normal myotubes, the level of expression of PLCbeta1 in DM1 and DM2 
      cells was already elevated in proliferating cells. Treatment with insulin induced 
      a dramatic decrease in the amount of PLCbeta1. During differentiation, cyclin D3 and 
      myogenin were elevated in normal myotubes, whereas differentiating DM1 and DM2 
      cells did not increase these proteins. Forced expression of PLCbeta1 in DM1 and DM2 
      cells increased the expression of differentiation markers, myogenin and cyclin 
      D3, and enhanced fusion of DM myoblasts. These results highlight again that PLCbeta1 
      expression is a key player in myoblast differentiation, functioning as a positive 
      regulator in the correction of delayed differentiation of skeletal muscle in DM 
      human myoblasts.

TI  - Clinical, electrophysiologic and pathologic findings in 10 patients with myotonic 
      dystrophy 2.
PG  - 745-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is an autosomal dominant, multisystem 
      disorder caused by a CCTG tetranucleotide repeat expansion located in intron 1 of 
      the zinc finger protein 9 gene (ZNF9 gene) on chromosome 3q 21.3. OBJECTIVES: To 
      describe the clinical, electrophysiologic and pathologic findings in patients 
      with myotonic dystrophy 2. METHODS: We evaluated 10 patients genetically, 
      clinically and electrophysiologically during the years 2007 to 2008. RESULTS: All 
      patients were of Jewish European ancestry. Among affected individuals, eight 
      patients had symptoms of proximal muscle weakness, two had muscle pain, and two 
      exhibited myotonia. On physical examination six patients had severe weakness of 
      hip flexor muscles. Seven individuals underwent cataract surgery, and cardiac 
      involvement was seen in one case. On the initial electromyographic (EMG) 
      examination five patients demonstrated myotonic discharges; repeated studies 
      showed these discharges in nine cases. Six muscle biopsies showed non-specific 
      pathological changes. Seven patients had an affected first-degree relative with 
      either a diagnosed or an undiagnosed muscular disorder consistent with an 
      autosomal dominant trait. CONCLUSIONS: DM2 may often present with proximal muscle 
      weakness without myotonia. EMG may initially fail to show myotonic discharges, 
      but these discharges may eventually show in most cases on repeated EMG. Thus, DM2 
      may be underdiagnosed and should be included in the differential diagnosis of 
      adult patients of Jewish European ancestry presenting with proximal lower limb 
      weakness.

TI  - Activation of the innate immune response and interferon signalling in myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1 and type 2 cataracts.
PG  - 852-62
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddr515 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by a triplet repeat expansion in the non-coding 
      region of either the DMPK (DM1) or CNBP (DM2) gene. Transcription of the expanded 
      region causes accumulation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in DM cells. We sought 
      to determine how expression of triplet repeat RNA causes the varied phenotype 
      typical of DM. Global transcription was measured in DM and non-DM cataract 
      samples using Illumina Bead Arrays. DM samples were compared with non-DM samples 
      and lists of differentially expressed genes (P</= 0.05) were prepared. Gene set 
      enrichment analysis and the Interferome database were used to search for 
      significant patterns of gene expression in DM cells. Expression of individual 
      genes was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. DMPK 
      and CNBP expression was confirmed in native lens cells showing that a toxic RNA 
      gain of function mechanism could exist in lens. A high proportion, 83% in DM1 and 
      75% in DM2, of the significantly disregulated genes were shared by both forms of 
      the disease, suggesting a common mechanism. The upregulated genes in DM1 and DM2 
      were highly enriched in both interferon-regulated genes (IRGs) and genes 
      associated with the response to dsRNA and the innate immune response. The 
      characteristic fingerprint of IRGs and the signalling pathways identified in lens 
      cells support a role for dsRNA activation of the innate immune response in the 
      pathology of DM. This new evidence forms the basis for a novel hypothesis to 
      explain the complex mechanism of DM.

TI  - Zebrafish deficient for Muscleblind-like 2 exhibit features of myotonic 
      dystrophy.
PG  - 381-92
LID - 10.1242/dmm.004150 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM; also known as dystrophia myotonica) is an autosomal 
      dominant disorder that affects the heart, eyes, brain and endocrine system, but 
      the predominant symptoms are neuromuscular, with progressive muscle weakness and 
      wasting. DM presents in two forms, DM1 and DM2, both of which are caused by 
      nucleotide repeat expansions: CTG in the DMPK gene for DM1 and CCTG in ZNF9 
      (CNBP) for DM2. Previous studies have shown that the mutant mRNAs containing the 
      transcribed CUG or CCUG repeats are retained within the nuclei of cells from 
      individuals with DM, where they bind and sequester the muscleblind-like proteins 
      MBNL1, MBNL2 and MBNL3. It has been proposed that the sequestration of these 
      proteins plays a key role in determining the classic features of DM. However, the 
      functions of each of the three MBNL genes are not completely understood. We have 
      generated a zebrafish knockdown model in which we demonstrate that a lack of 
      mbnl2 function causes morphological abnormalities at the eye, heart, brain and 
      muscle levels, supporting an essential role for mbnl2 during embryonic 
      development. Major features of DM are replicated in our model, including muscle 
      defects and splicing abnormalities. We found that the absence of mbnl2 causes 
      disruption to the organization of myofibrils in skeletal and heart muscle of 
      zebrafish embryos, and a reduction in the amount of both slow and fast muscle 
      fibres. Notably, our findings included altered splicing patterns of two 
      transcripts whose expression is also altered in DM patients: clcn1 and tnnt2. The 
      studies described herein provide broader insight into the functions of MBNL2. 
      They also lend support to the hypothesis that the sequestration of this protein 
      is an important determinant in DM pathophysiology, and imply a direct role of 
      MBNL2 in splicing regulation of specific transcripts, which, when altered, 
      contributes to the DM phenotype.

TI  - Dutch myotonic dystrophy type 2 patients and a North-African DM2 family carry the 
      common European founder haplotype.
PG  - 567-70
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2010.233 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is a progressive multisystem disease with muscle 
      weakness and myotonia as main characteristics. The disease is caused by a repeat 
      expansion in the zinc-finger protein 9 (ZNF9) gene on chromosome 3q21. Several 
      reports show that patients from European ancestry share an identical haplotype 
      surrounding the ZNF9 gene. In this study, we investigated whether the Dutch DM2 
      population carries the same founder haplotype. In all, 40 Dutch DM2 patients from 
      16 families were genotyped for eight short tandem repeat markers surrounding the 
      ZNF9 gene. In addition, the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1871922 
      located in the first intron of DM2 was genotyped. Results were compared with 
      previously published haplotypes from unrelated Caucasian patients. The repeat 
      lengths identified in this study were in agreement with existing literature. In 
      36 patients of our population, we identified three common haplotypes. One patient 
      showed overlap with the common haplotype for only one marker closest to the ZNF9 
      gene. The haplotype from a family originating from Morocco showed overlap with 
      that of the patients of European descent for a region of 222 kb. All patients 
      carried at least one C allele of SNP rs1871922 indicating that all patients carry 
      the European founder haplotype. We conclude that DM2 patients from the 
      Netherlands, including a North-African family, harbor a common haplotype 
      surrounding the ZNF9 gene. This data show that the Dutch patients carry the 
      common founder haplotype and strongly suggest that DM2 mutations in Europe and 
      North Africa originate from a single ancestral founder.

TI  - Myotonia congenita and myotonic dystrophy in the same family: coexistence of a 
      CLCN1 mutation and expansion in the CNBP (ZNF9) gene.

AB  - Myotonia is characterized by hyperexcitability of the muscle cell membrane. 
      Myotonic disorders are divided into two main categories: non-dystrophic and 
      dystrophic myotonias. The non-dystrophic myotonias involve solely the muscle 
      system, whereas the dystrophic myotonias are characterized by multisystem 
      involvement and additional muscle weakness. Each category is further subdivided 
      into different groups according to additional clinical features or/and underlying 
      genetic defects. However, the phenotypes and the pathological mechanisms of these 
      myotonic disorders are still not entirely understood. Currently, four genes are 
      identified to be involved in myotonia: the muscle voltage-gated sodium and 
      chloride channel genes SCN4A and CLCN1, the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase 
      (DMPK) gene, and the CCHC-type zinc finger, nucleic acid binding protein gene 
      CNBP. Additional gene(s) and/or modifying factor(s) remain to be identified. In 
      this study, we investigated a large Norwegian family with clinically different 
      presentations of myotonic disorders. Molecular analysis revealed CCTG repeat 
      expansions in the CNBP gene in all affected members, confirming that they have 
      myotonic dystrophy type 2. However, a CLCN1 mutation c.1238C>G, causing 
      p.Phe413Cys, was also identified in several affected family members. 
      Heterozygosity for p.Phe413Cys seems to exaggerate the severity of myotonia and 
      thereby, to some degree, contributing to the pronounced variability in the 
      myotonic phenotype in this family.

TI  - Mutant (CCTG)n expansion causes abnormal expression of zinc finger protein 9 
      (ZNF9) in myotonic dystrophy type 2.
PG  - 3025-36
LID - 10.2353/ajpath.2010.100179 [doi]
AB  - The mutation that underlies myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is a (CCTG)n 
      expansion in intron 1 of zinc finger protein 9 (ZNF9). It has been suggested that 
      ZNF9 is of no consequence for disease pathogenesis. We determined the expression 
      levels of ZNF9 during muscle cell differentiation and in DM2 muscle by microarray 
      profiling, real-time RT-PCR, splice variant analysis, immunofluorescence, and 
      Western blotting. Our results show that in differentiating myoblasts, ZNF9 
      protein was localized primarily to the nucleus, whereas in mature muscle fibers, 
      it was cytoplasmic and organized in sarcomeric striations at the Z-disk. In 
      patients with DM2, ZNF9 was abnormally expressed. First, there was an overall 
      reduction in both the mRNA and protein levels. Second, the subcellular 
      localization of the ZNF9 protein was somewhat less cytoplasmic and more 
      membrane-bound. Third, our splice variant analysis revealed retention of intron 3 
      in an aberrant isoform, and fourth quantitative allele-specific expression 
      analysis showed the persistence of intron 1 sequences from the abnormal allele, 
      further suggesting that the mutant allele is incompletely spliced. Thus, the 
      decrease in total expression appears to be due to impaired splicing of the mutant 
      transcript. Our data indicate that ZNF9 expression in DM2 patients is altered at 
      multiple levels. Although toxic RNA effects likely explain overlapping phenotypic 
      manifestations between DM1 and DM2, abnormal ZNF9 levels in DM2 may account for 
      the differences in DM1.

TI  - Brugada-like cardiac disease in myotonic dystrophy type 2: report of two 
      unrelated patients.
PG  - 191-4
LID - 10.1111/j.1468-1331.2010.03077.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is an autosomal dominant multisystem 
      disorder caused by CCTG repeat expansions within intron 1 of the ZNF9 gene on 
      chromosome 3q. Cardiac conduction disturbances, supraventricular arrhythmias, and 
      cardiomyopathy are described in DM2 but Brugada-like features have not yet been 
      reported. Brugada syndrome (BS) is a genetically heterogeneous cardiac conduction 
      disorder which is characterized by a significant ST-segment elevation upon ECG 
      evaluations and bears an increased risk for sudden cardiac death. CASE REPORTS: 
      We report two unrelated patients with genetically confirmed DM2 who developed 
      clinical relevant cardiac arrhythmias with syncopal events from 35 (patient 1) 
      and 47 years (patient 2). Brugada-like ECG findings were present in both 
      patients. Family history was negative for BS, but the mothers of both index 
      patients were also affected by DM2 and had different ventricular rhythm 
      disturbances. SCN5A gene sequencing revealed an unknown genetic variant c.4140 C 
      > A, p.N1380K, in patient 1, while no mutation was detected in patient 2. 
      DISCUSSION: Our observations may suggest that Brugada-like cardiac arrhythmias 
      can occur in DM2, as this seems also to be the case in DM1. The chance 
      association of two independent inherited disorders has to be considered and 
      cannot be excluded in one of our patients. However, on statistical grounds, this 
      possibility cannot explain all observed cases of DM with Brugada-like cardiac 
      disease.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 (DM1 and DM2) are forms of muscular dystrophy 
      that share similar clinical and molecular manifestations, such as myotonia, 
      muscle weakness, cardiac anomalies, cataracts, and the presence of defined 
      RNA-containing foci in muscle nuclei. DM2 is caused by an expansion of the 
      tetranucleotide CCTG repeat within the first intron of ZNF9, although the 
      mechanism by which the expanded nucleotide repeat causes the debilitating 
      symptoms of DM2 is unclear. Conflicting studies have led to two models for the 
      mechanisms leading to the problems associated with DM2. First, a gain-of-function 
      disease model hypothesizes that the repeat expansions in the transcribed RNA do 
      not directly affect ZNF9 function. Instead repeat-containing RNAs are thought to 
      sequester proteins in the nucleus, causing misregulation of normal cellular 
      processes. In the alternative model, the repeat expansions impair ZNF9 function 
      and lead to a decrease in the level of translation. Here we examine the normal in 
      vivo function of ZNF9. We report that ZNF9 associates with actively translating 
      ribosomes and functions as an activator of cap-independent translation of the 
      human ODC mRNA. This activity is mediated by direct binding of ZNF9 to the 
      internal ribosome entry site sequence (IRES) within the 5'UTR of ODC mRNA. ZNF9 
      can activate IRES-mediated translation of ODC within primary human myoblasts, and 
      this activity is reduced in myoblasts derived from a DM2 patient. These data 
      identify ZNF9 as a regulator of cap-independent translation and indicate that 
      ZNF9 activity may contribute mechanistically to the myotonic dystrophy type 2 
      phenotype.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is a dominantly inherited disorder caused by a 
      CCTG repeat expansion in intron 1 of ZNF9 gene. The size and the somatic 
      instability of DM2 expansion complicate the molecular diagnosis of DM2. In situ 
      hybridization represents a rapid and sensitive method to obtain a definitive 
      diagnosis in few hours, since it allows the direct visualization of the mutant 
      mRNA foci on skeletal muscle sections. This approach makes the muscle biopsy an 
      important tool for definitive diagnosis of DM2. Consequently, a rapid freezing at 
      ultra cold temperature and a good storage of muscle specimens are essential to 
      avoid morphologic alterations and nucleic acids degradation. However incorrect 
      freezing or thawing may accidentally occur. In this work we report that 
      fluorescence in situ hybridization may be applied on improperly frozen or 
      inappropriately stored muscle biopsies since foci of mutant mRNA are well 
      preserved and can still be detected in muscle sections no more useful for 
      histopathological evaluation.

TI  - Absence of a differentiation defect in muscle satellite cells from DM2 patients.
PG  - 181-90
LID - 10.1016/j.nbd.2009.07.009 [doi]
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and type II (DM2) are dominantly inherited 
      multisystemic disorders. DM1 is triggered by the pathological expansion of a 
      (CTG)(n) triplet repeat in the DMPK gene, whereas a (CCTG)(n) tetranucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the ZNF9 gene causes DM2. Both forms of the disease share 
      several features, even though the causative mutations and the loci involved 
      differ. Important distinctions exist, such as the lack of a congenital form of 
      DM2. The reason for these disparities is unknown. In this study, we characterized 
      skeletal muscle satellite cells from adult DM2 patients to provide an in vitro 
      model for the disease. We used muscle cells from DM1 biopsies as a comparison 
      tool. Our main finding is that DM2 satellite cells differentiate normally in 
      vitro. Myotube formation was similar to unaffected controls. In contrast, fetal 
      DM1 cells were deficient in that ability. Consistent with this observation, the 
      myogenic program in DM2 was intact but is compromised in fetal DM1 cells. 
      Although expression of the ZNF9 gene was enhanced in DM2 during differentiation, 
      the levels of the ZNF9 protein were substantially reduced. This suggests that the 
      presence of a large CCTG tract impairs the translation of the ZNF9 mRNA. 
      Additionally, DM2 muscle biopsies displayed the altered splicing of the insulin 
      receptor mRNA, correlating with insulin resistance in the patients. Finally, 
      CUGBP1 steady-state protein levels were unchanged in DM2 cultured muscle cells 
      and in DM2 muscle biopsies relative to controls, whereas they are increased in 
      DM1 muscle cells. Our findings suggest that the myogenic program throughout 
      muscle development and tissue regeneration is intact in DM2.

TI  - A Z-DNA sequence reduces slipped-strand structure formation in the myotonic 
      dystrophy type 2 (CCTG) x (CAGG) repeat.
PG  - 3270-5
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0807699106 [doi]
AB  - All DNA repeats known to undergo expansion leading to human neurodegenerative 
      disease can form one, or several, alternative conformations, including hairpin, 
      slipped strand, triplex, quadruplex, or unwound DNA structures. These alternative 
      structures may interfere with the normal cellular processes of transcription, DNA 
      repair, replication initiation, or polymerase elongation and thereby contribute 
      to the genetic instability of these repeat tracts. We show that (CCTG) x (CAGG) 
      repeats, in the first intron of the ZNF9 gene associated with myotonic dystrophy 
      type 2, form slipped-strand DNA structures in a length-dependent fashion upon 
      reduplexing. The threshold for structure formation on reduplexing is between 36 
      and 42 repeats in length. Alternative DNA structures also form in (CCTG)(58) x 
      (CAGG)(58) and larger repeat tracts in plasmids at physiological superhelical 
      densities. This represents an example of a sequence that forms slipped-strand DNA 
      from the energy of DNA supercoiling. Moreover, Z-DNA forms in a (TG) x (CA) tract 
      within the complex repeat sequence 5' of the (CCTG)(n) x (CAGG)(n) repeat in the 
      ZNF9 gene. Upon reduplexing, the presence of the flanking sequence containing the 
      Z-DNA-forming tract reduced the extent of slipped-strand DNA formation by 62% for 
      (CCTG)(57) x (CAGG)(57) compared with 58 pure repeats without the flanking 
      sequence. This finding suggests that the Z-DNA-forming sequence in the DM2 gene 
      locus may have a protective effect of reducing the potential for slipped-strand 
      DNA formation in (CCTG)(n) x (CAGG)(n) repeats.

AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is an autosomal dominant multisystemic disorder 
      caused by a CCTG repeat expansion in intron 1 of the zinc finger protein 9 (ZNF9) 
      gene. We present a three first-degree relative Italian family (proband, his 
      mother and his sister) with a mild DM2 phenotype associated with a short 
      (CCTG)(100) expansion as far as regards the proband and his mother, while his 
      sister shows larger expansion correlated to a more severe phenotype. FISH 
      analysis with (CAGG)(5) probe demonstrated that nuclear foci of mutant RNA were 
      present in the proband muscle and co-localized with muscleblind-like proteins, 
      determining their sequestration in the nucleus. This is one of the smallest 
      expansion reported and the shortest with the evidence of nuclear foci. These data 
      contribute to the clinical and molecular correlation of ZNF9 gene short 
      expansion.

AB  - Evidence for an RNA gain-of-function toxicity has now been provided for an 
      increasing number of human pathologies. Myotonic dystrophies (DM) belong to a 
      class of RNA-dominant diseases that result from RNA repeat expansion toxicity. 
      Specifically, DM of type 1 (DM1), is caused by an expansion of CUG repeats in the 
      3'UTR of the DMPK protein kinase mRNA, while DM of type 2 (DM2) is linked to an 
      expansion of CCUG repeats in an intron of the ZNF9 transcript (ZNF9 encodes a 
      zinc finger protein). In both pathologies the mutant RNA forms nuclear foci. The 
      mechanisms that underlie the RNA pathogenicity seem to be rather complex and not 
      yet completely understood. Here, we describe Drosophila models that might help 
      unravelling the molecular mechanisms of DM1-associated CUG expansion toxicity. We 
      generated transgenic flies that express inducible repeats of different type (CUG 
      or CAG) and length (16, 240, 480 repeats) and then analyzed transgene 
      localization, RNA expression and toxicity as assessed by induced lethality and 
      eye neurodegeneration. The only line that expressed a toxic RNA has a (CTG)(240) 
      insertion. Moreover our analysis shows that its level of expression cannot 
      account for its toxicity. In this line, (CTG)(240.4), the expansion inserted in 
      the first intron of CG9650, a zinc finger protein encoding gene. Interestingly, 
      CG9650 and (CUG)(240.4) expansion RNAs were found in the same nuclear foci. In 
      conclusion, we suggest that the insertion context is the primary determinant for 
      expansion toxicity in Drosophila models. This finding should contribute to the 
      still open debate on the role of the expansions per se in Drosophila and in human 
      pathogenesis of RNA-dominant diseases.

TI  - Flies deficient in Muscleblind protein model features of myotonic dystrophy with 
      altered splice forms of Z-band associated transcripts.
PG  - 487-99
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a dominantly inherited neuromuscular disorder 
      characterised by muscle weakness and wasting. There are two forms of DM; both of 
      which are caused by the expansion of repeated DNA sequences. DM1 is associated 
      with a CTG repeat located in the 3' untranslated region of a gene, DMPK and DM2 
      with a tetranucleotide repeat expansion, CCTG, located in the first intron of a 
      different gene, ZNF9. Recent data suggest a dominant RNA gain-of-function 
      mechanism underlying DM, as transcripts containing either CUG or CCUG repeat 
      expansions accumulate as foci in the nuclei of DM1 and DM2 cells respectively, 
      where they exert a toxic effect, sequestering specific RNA binding proteins such 
      as Muscleblind, which leads to splicing defects and the disruption of normal 
      cellular functions. Z-band disruption is a well-known histological feature of DM1 
      muscle, which has also been reported in Muscleblind deficient flies. In order to 
      determine whether there is a common molecular basis for this abnormality we have 
      examined the alternative splicing pattern of transcripts that encode proteins 
      associated with the Z-band in both organisms. Our results demonstrate that the 
      missplicing of ZASP/LDB3 leads to the expression of an isoform in DM1 patient 
      muscle, which is not present in normal controls, nor in other myopathies. 
      Furthermore the Drosophila homologue, CG30084, is also misspliced, in Muscleblind 
      deficient flies. Another Z-band transcript, alpha actinin, is misspliced in mbl 
      mutant flies, but not in DM1 patient samples. These results point to similarities 
      but subtle differences in the molecular breakdown of Z-band structures in flies 
      and DM patients and emphasise the relevance of Muscleblind proteins in DM 
      pathophysiology.

TI  - DM2 intronic expansions: evidence for CCUG accumulation without flanking sequence 
      or effects on ZNF9 mRNA processing or protein expression.
PG  - 1808-15
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is caused by a CCTG expansion mutation in intron 
      1 of the zinc finger protein 9 (ZNF9) gene. The mean expansion size in patients 
      is larger than for DM1 or any previously reported disorder (mean=5000 CCTGs; 
      range=75-11 000), and similar to DM1, repeats containing ribonuclear inclusions 
      accumulate in affected DM2 tissue. Although an RNA gain-of-function mechanism 
      involving DM1 CUG or DM2 CCUG expansion transcripts is now well established, 
      still debated are the potential role that flanking sequences within the DMPK 
      3'-UTR may have on disease pathogenesis and whether or not decreased expression 
      of DMPK, ZNF9 or neighboring genes at these loci contribute to disease. To 
      address these questions in DM2, we have examined the nucleic acid content of the 
      ribonuclear inclusions and the effects of these large expansions on ZNF9 
      expression. Using cell lines either haploid or homozygous for the expansion, as 
      well as skeletal muscle biopsy tissue, we demonstrate that pre-mRNAs containing 
      large CCUG expansions are normally spliced and exported from the nucleus, that 
      the expansions do not decrease ZNF9 expression at the mRNA or protein level, and 
      that the ribonuclear inclusions are enriched for the CCUG expansion, but not 
      intronic flanking sequences. These data suggest that the downstream molecular 
      effects of the DM2 mutation are triggered by the accumulation of CCUG repeat 
      tract alone.

TI  - Effect of the [CCTG]n repeat expansion on ZNF9 expression in myotonic dystrophy 
      type II (DM2).
PG  - 329-34
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy is caused by two different mutations: a (CTG)n expansion in 3' 
      UTR region of the DMPK gene (DM1) and a (CCTG)n expansion in intron 1 of the ZNF9 
      gene (DM2). The most accredited mechanism for DM pathogenesis is an RNA 
      gain-of-function. Other findings suggest a contributory role of 
      DMPK-insufficiency in DM1. To address the issue of ZNF9 role in DM2, we have 
      analyzed the effects of (CCTG)n expansion on ZNF9 expression in lymphoblastoid 
      cell lines (n=4) from DM2 patients. We did not observe any significant alteration 
      in ZNF9 mRNA and protein levels, as shown by QRT-PCR and Western blot analyses. 
      Additional RT-PCR experiments demonstrated that ZNF9 pre-mRNA splicing pattern, 
      which includes two isoforms, is unmodified in DM2 cells. Our results indicate 
      that the (CCTG)n expansion in the ZNF9 intron does not appear to have a direct 
      consequence on the expression of the gene itself.

TI  - Biomolecular identification of (CCTG)n mutation in myotonic dystrophy type 2 
      (DM2) by FISH on muscle biopsy.
PG  - 437-42
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is a dominantly inherited disorder with 
      multisystemic clinical features, caused by a CCTG repeat expansion in intron 1 of 
      the zinc finger protein 9 (ZNF9) gene. The mutant transcripts are retained in the 
      nucleus forming multiple discrete foci also called ribonuclear inclusions. The 
      size and the somatic instability of DM2 expansion complicate the molecular 
      diagnosis of DM2. In our study fluorescence-labeled CAGG-repeat oligonucleotides 
      were hybridized to muscle biopsies to investigate if fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization (FISH), a relatively quick and simple procedure, could be used as a 
      method to diagnose DM2. When FISH was performed with (CAGG)5 probe, nuclear foci 
      of mutant RNA were present in all genetically confirmed DM2 patients (n=17) and 
      absent in all patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1; n=5) or with other 
      muscular disease (n=17) used as controls. In contrast, foci were observed both in 
      DM1 and DM2 myonuclei when muscle tissue were hybridized with (CAG)6CA probe 
      indicating that this probe is not specific for DM2 identification. The consistent 
      detection of ribonuclear inclusions in DM2 muscles and their absence in DM1, in 
      agreement with the clinical diagnosis and with leukocyte (CCTG)n expansion, 
      suggests that fluorescence in situ hybridization using (CAGG)5 probes, may be a 
      specific method to distinguish between DM1 and DM2. Moreover, the procedure is 
      simple, and readily applicable in any pathology laboratory.

TI  - Hyper-CK-emia as the sole manifestation of myotonic dystrophy type 2.
PG  - 764-7
AB  - A 49-year-old man had an 8-year history of persistent, isolated elevation of 
      serum creatine kinase (hyper-CK-emia) without muscle symptoms, and no 
      electromyographic evidence of myotonia; his muscle biopsy showed features 
      reminiscent of myotonic dystrophy (DM), with morphometric findings consistent 
      with those described in DM type 2 (DM2). Genetic studies excluded mutations in 
      the DM type 1 (DM1) gene, but revealed a CCTG repeat expansion in the ZNF9 gene, 
      which is associated with DM2. Our data suggest that in asymptomatic patients with 
      persistent hyper-CK-emia, DM2 should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

TI  - A long PCR-based molecular protocol for detecting normal and expanded ZNF9 
      alleles in myotonic dystrophy type 2.
PG  - 164-6
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) lacks the expansion on chromosome 19q13 present 
      in DM1 and is characterized by a mutation on 3q21. It has been shown that the DM2 
      mutation is a huge [CCTG]n repeat expansion in intron 1 of the zinc finger 
      protein 9 (ZNF9) gene. The longest normal allele observed has a approximately 30 
      CCTG repeat, whereas the range of expansion is extremely variable, starting from 
      75 up to 11,000 CCTGs. Direct analysis by Southern blot, after restriction enzyme 
      digestion of genomic DNA, was the first method chosen for studying the DM2 
      mutation. However, the expansion size and the elevated grade of somatic 
      instability have limited the sensitivity of the test to approximately 80% of 
      known carriers. We developed a long PCR-formatted protocol, which involves a 
      single genomic in vitro amplification, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis 
      and oligospecific hybridization. We were able to detect normal alleles and 
      expanded ZNF9 alleles, starting from low amounts of genomic DNA (>/= 1 ng) in 
      virtually all the DM2 patients analyzed, obtaining a molecular detection rate of 
      100%. This method is quick, sensitive, and reproducible, and it reduces the cost 
      of diagnostic laboratory processing for DM2 diagnosis.

TI  - Homozygosity for CCTG mutation in myotonic dystrophy type 2.
PG  - 1868-77
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is caused by a dominantly transmitted CCTG repeat 
      expansion in intron 1 of the zinc finger protein 9 (ZNF9) gene on chromosome 3q. 
      DM2 patients with two mutant alleles have not been reported so far. In one large 
      consanguineous family from Afghanistan, we found three homozygotes for the DM2 
      mutation. The oldest patient was clinically more severely affected, compared with 
      the two younger homozygotes, but for the clinical course of symptoms all three 
      homozygotes were within the range expected for heterozygotes. Further 
      investigations, such as mutation repeat length, muscle histology, 
      anti-muscleblind-like 1 stainings or brain imaging studies, at least at 
      short-term observation, showed no differences between heterozygotes and 
      homozygotes. Twenty of 24 children, aged 2-21 years, were available for clinical 
      examination. None of these children have signs or symptoms of disease until the 
      age of 18 years. Homozygosity for the DM2 expansion does not seem to alter the 
      disease phenotype as compared with the heterozygous state.

TI  - A non-DM1, non-DM2 multisystem myotonic disorder with frontotemporal dementia: 
      phenotype and suggestive mapping of the DM3 locus to chromosome 15q21-24.
PG  - 1979-92
AB  - The majority of proximal myotonic myopathy syndromes reported so far have been 
      related to the myotonic dystrophy (DM) type 2 (DM2) mutation, an expanded (CCTG)n 
      repeat in the ZNF9 gene. Here, we describe the phenotype and the histological 
      features in muscle and brain of the first large pedigree with a non-myotonic 
      dystrophy type 1 (DM1) non-DM2 multisystem myotonic disorder associated with 
      severe frontotemporal dementia. Thirty individuals from three generations 
      underwent detailed neurological, neuropsychological, electrophysiological, brain 
      imaging and molecular analyses. Ten of them had proximal muscle weakness at 
      onset, clinical/electrical myotonia and DM-type cataracts. The mean age at onset 
      was 46.7 +/- 12.6 years (range: 32-69). Dementia was observed later in the course 
      of the disease. On muscle biopsies, rare nuclear clumps, rimmed vacuoles and 
      small angulated type 1 and type 2 fibres were seen early in the disease. They 
      were replaced by fibrous adipose tissue at later stages. Immunohistochemical 
      analysis of myosin heavy chain isoforms showed no selective fibre type 
      atrophy-both type 1 and type 2 fibres being affected. Cortical atrophy without 
      white matter lesions was seen on brain MRI. A brain single photon emission 
      computed tomography (SPECT) study revealed marked frontotemporal hypoperfusion. 
      Post-mortem examination of the brains of two patients showing prominent 
      frontotemporal spongiosis, neuronal loss and rare neuronal and glial tau 
      inclusions suggested frontotemporal dementia. Western blot analyses of the tau 
      protein showed a triplet of isoforms (60, 64 and 69 kDa) in neocortical areas, 
      and a doublet (64 and 69 kDa) in subcortical areas that distinguish our myotonic 
      disorder from other's myotonic dystrophies. Molecular analyses failed to detect a 
      repeat expansion in the DMPK and ZNF9 genes excluding both DM1 and DM2, whereas a 
      genome-wide linkage analysis strongly suggested a linkage to chromosome 15q21-24. 
      This previously unreported multisystem myotonic disorder including findings 
      resembling DM1, DM2 and frontotemporal dementia provides further evidence of the 
      clinical and genetic heterogeneity of the myotonic dystrophies. We propose to 
      designate this disease myotonic dystrophy type 3, DM3.

      RNA-binding proteins adhere to transcripts of the repeat expansions that 
      accumulate in the nucleus, and a trans-dominant dysregulation of pre-mRNA 
      alternative splicing has been demonstrated for several genes. In muscle from 
      patients with DM1, altered insulin-receptor splicing to the nonmuscle isoform 
      corresponds to the insulin insensitivity and diabetes that are part of the DM 
      phenotype; because of insulin-receptor species differences, this effect is not 
      seen in mouse models of the disease. We now demonstrate that comparable splicing 
      abnormalities occur in DM2 muscle prior to the development of muscle 
      histopathology, thus demonstrating an early pathogenic effect of RNA expansions.

      myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2).
PG  - 274-83
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 are autosomal dominant, multisystemic disorders 
      with many similarities in their clinical manifestations. Myotonic dystrophy type 
      1 is caused by a (CTG)n expansion in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene 
      in 19q13.3 and myotonic dystrophy type 2 by a (CCTG)n expansion in intron 1 of 
      ZNF9 in 3q21.3. However, the clinical diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy type 2 is 
      more complex than that of myotonic dystrophy type 1, and conventional molecular 
      genetic methods used for diagnosing myotonic dystrophy type 1 are insufficient 
      for myotonic dystrophy type 2. Herein we describe two in situ hybridization 
      protocols for the myotonic dystrophy type 2 mutation detection. Chromogenic in 
      situ hybridization was used to detect both the genomic expansion and the mutant 
      transcripts in muscle biopsy sections. Chromogenic in situ hybridization can be 
      used in routine myotonic dystrophy type 2 diagnostics. Fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization on extended DNA fibers was used to directly visualize the myotonic 
      dystrophy type 2 mutation and to estimate the repeat expansion sizes.

TI  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2: human founder haplotype and evolutionary conservation 
      of the repeat tract.
PG  - 849-62
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM), the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults, 
      can be caused by a mutation on either chromosome 19 (DM1) or 3 (DM2). In 2001, we 
      demonstrated that DM2 is caused by a CCTG expansion in intron 1 of the zinc 
      finger protein 9 (ZNF9) gene. To investigate the ancestral origins of the DM2 
      expansion, we compared haplotypes for 71 families with genetically confirmed DM2, 
      using 19 short tandem repeat markers that we developed that flank the repeat 
      tract. All of the families are white, with the majority of Northern 
      European/German descent and a single family from Afghanistan. Several conserved 
      haplotypes spanning >700 kb appear to converge into a single haplotype near the 
      repeat tract. The common interval that is shared by all families with DM2 
      immediately flanks the repeat, extending up to 216 kb telomeric and 119 kb 
      centromeric of the CCTG expansion. The DM2 repeat tract contains the complex 
      repeat motif (TG)(n)(TCTG)(n)(CCTG)(n). The CCTG portion of the repeat tract is 
      interrupted on normal alleles, but, as in other expansion disorders, these 
      interruptions are lost on affected alleles. We examined haplotypes of 228 control 
      chromosomes and identified a potential premutation allele with an uninterrupted 
      (CCTG)(20) on a haplotype that was identical to the most common affected 
      haplotype. Our data suggest that the predominant Northern European ancestry of 
      families with DM2 resulted from a common founder and that the loss of 
      interruptions within the CCTG portion of the repeat tract may predispose alleles 
      to further expansion. To gain insight into possible function of the repeat tract, 
      we looked for evolutionary conservation. The complex repeat motif and flanking 
      sequences within intron 1 are conserved among human, chimpanzee, gorilla, mouse, 
      and rat, suggesting a conserved biological function.

TI  - Confirmation of the type 2 myotonic dystrophy (CCTG)n expansion mutation in 
      patients with proximal myotonic myopathy/proximal myotonic dystrophy of different 
      European origins: a single shared haplotype indicates an ancestral founder 
      effect.
PG  - 835-48
AB  - Myotonic dystrophy (DM), the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults, is 
      a clinically and genetically heterogeneous neuromuscular disorder. DM is 
      characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, muscular dystrophy, myotonia, 
      and multisystem involvement. Type 1 DM (DM1) is caused by a (CTG)(n) expansion in 
      the 3' untranslated region of DMPK in 19q13.3. Multiple families, predominantly 
      of German descent and with clinically variable presentation that included 
      proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM) and type 2 DM (DM2) but without the DM1 
      mutation, showed linkage to the 3q21 region and were recently shown to segregate 
      a (CCTG)(n) expansion mutation in intron 1 of ZNF9. Here, we present linkage to 
      3q21 and mutational confirmation in 17 kindreds of European origin with PROMM and 
      proximal myotonic dystrophy, from geographically distinct populations. All 
      patients have the DM2 (CCTG)(n) expansion. To study the evolution of this 
      mutation, we constructed a comprehensive physical map of the DM2 region around 
      ZNF9. High-resolution haplotype analysis of disease chromosomes with five 
      microsatellite and 22 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers around the DM2 
      mutation identified extensive linkage disequilibrium and a single shared 
      haplotype of at least 132 kb among patients from the different populations. With 
      the exception of the (CCTG)(n) expansion, the available markers indicate that the 
      DM2 haplotype is identical to the most common haplotype in normal individuals. 
      This situation is reminiscent of that seen in DM1. Taken together, these data 
      suggest a single founding mutation in DM2 patients of European origin. We 
      estimate the age of the founding haplotype and of the DM2 (CCTG) expansion 
      mutation to be approximately 200-540 generations.

TI  - Myotonic dystrophy type 2: molecular, diagnostic and clinical spectrum.
PG  - 657-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: Myotonic dystrophy types 1 (DM1) and 2 (DM2/proximal myotonic 
      myopathy PROMM) are dominantly inherited disorders with unusual multisystemic 
      clinical features. The authors have characterized the clinical and molecular 
      features of DM2/PROMM, which is caused by a CCTG repeat expansion in intron 1 of 
      the zinc finger protein 9 (ZNF9) gene. METHODS: Three-hundred and seventy-nine 
      individuals from 133 DM2/PROMM families were evaluated genetically, and in 234 
      individuals clinical and molecular features were compared. RESULTS: Among 
      affected individuals 90% had electrical myotonia, 82% weakness, 61% cataracts, 
      23% diabetes, and 19% cardiac involvement. Because of the repeat tract's 
      unprecedented size (mean approximately 5,000 CCTGs) and somatic instability, 
      expansions were detectable by Southern analysis in only 80% of known carriers. 
      The authors developed a repeat assay that increased the molecular detection rate 
      to 99%. Only 30% of the positive samples had single sizeable expansions by 
      Southern analysis, and 70% showed multiple bands or smears. Among the 101 
      individuals with single expansions, repeat size did not correlate with age at 
      disease onset. Affected offspring had markedly shorter expansions than their 
      affected parents, with a mean size difference of -17 kb (-4,250 CCTGs). 
      CONCLUSIONS: DM2 is present in a large number of families of northern European 
      ancestry. Clinically, DM2 resembles adult-onset DM1, with myotonia, muscular 
      dystrophy, cataracts, diabetes, testicular failure, hypogammaglobulinemia, and 
      cardiac conduction defects. An important distinction is the lack of a congenital 
      form of DM2. The clinical and molecular parallels between DM1 and DM2 indicate 
      that the multisystemic features common to both diseases are caused by CUG or CCUG 
      expansions expressed at the RNA level.
