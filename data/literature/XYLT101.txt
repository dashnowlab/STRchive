AB  - Baratela-Scott syndrome (BSS) is a rare, autosomal-recessive disorder 
      characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphisms, developmental delay, and 
      skeletal dysplasia caused by pathogenic variants in XYLT1. We report clinical and 
      molecular investigation of 10 families (12 individuals) with BSS. Standard 
      sequencing methods identified biallelic pathogenic variants in XYLT1 in only two 
      families. Of the remaining cohort, two probands had no variants and six probands 
      had only a single variant, including four with a heterozygous 3.1 Mb 16p13 
      deletion encompassing XYLT1 and two with a heterozygous truncating variant. 
      Bisulfite sequencing revealed aberrant hypermethylation in exon 1 of XYLT1, 
      always in trans with the sequence variant or deletion when present; both alleles 
      were methylated in those with no identified variant. Expression of the methylated 
      XYLT1 allele was severely reduced in fibroblasts from two probands. Southern blot 
      studies combined with repeat expansion analysis of genome sequence data showed 
      that the hypermethylation is associated with expansion of a GGC repeat in the 
      XYLT1 promoter region that is not present in the reference genome, confirming 
      that BSS is a trinucleotide repeat expansion disorder. The hypermethylated allele 
      accounts for 50% of disease alleles in our cohort and is not present in 130 
      control subjects. Our study highlights the importance of investigating 
      non-sequence-based alterations, including epigenetic changes, to identify the 
      missing heritability in genetic disorders.
