TI  - Genetic Analysis of GCA Repeats in the GLS Gene: Implications for Undiagnosed 
      Ataxia and Spinocerebellar Ataxia 3 in Mainland China.
PG  - 324-334

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported that expanded GCA repeats in the GLS 
      gene can cause glutaminase deficiency with ataxia phenotype. However, to data, no 
      studies have investigated the distribution and role of GCA repeats in the GLS 
      gene of Chinese individuals. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the 
      distribution of GCA repeats in Chinese individuals, including undiagnosed ataxia 
      patients for identifying causal factors, healthy controls for determining the 
      normal range, and ATX-ATXN3 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, SCA3) patients for 
      exploring genetic modifiers. METHODS: We combined whole-genome sequencing (WGS), 
      repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction, capillary electrophoresis (RP-PCR/CE), 
      and ExpansionHunter to screen the GCA repeats in the GLS gene of 349 undiagnosed 
      ataxia individuals, 1505 healthy controls, and 1236 ATX-ATXN3 (SCA3) patients 
      from mainland China. RESULTS: No expanded GCA repeats in the GLS gene were 
      detected across any of the samples. The average number of GCA repeats was 11 
      (range: 8-31), 12 (range: 6-33), and 11 (range: 6-33) for undiagnosed ataxia 
      patients, healthy controls, and SCA3 patients, respectively. The intermediate 
      repeat size (9 < repeat size </= 13) of the nonexpanded GCA allele in the GLS gene 
      was associated with later disease onset in ATX-ATXN3 (SCA3) patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal expansions of GLS GCA repeats are rare in the Chinese 
      population. However, intermediate-length normal GCA repeat sizes may influence 
      the age at onset (AAO) in ATX-ATXN3 (SCA3) patients. (c) 2024 International

AB  - Expansions and contractions of tandem DNA repeats are a source of genetic 
      variation in human populations and in human tissues: some expanded repeats cause 
      inherited disorders, and some are also somatically unstable. We analyzed DNA 
      sequence data, derived from the blood cells of >700,000 participants in UK 
      Biobank and the All of Us Research Program, and developed new computational 
      approaches to recognize, measure and learn from DNA-repeat instability at 15 
      highly polymorphic CAG-repeat loci. We found that expansion and contraction rates 
      varied widely across these 15 loci, even for alleles of the same length; repeats 
      at different loci also exhibited widely variable relative propensities to mutate 
      in the germline versus the blood. The high somatic instability of TCF4 repeats 
      enabled a genome-wide association analysis that identified seven loci at which 
      inherited variants modulate TCF4 repeat instability in blood cells. Three of the 
      implicated loci contained genes ( MSH3 , FAN1 , and PMS2 ) that also modulate 
      Huntington's disease age-at-onset as well as somatic instability of the HTT 
      repeat in blood; however, the specific genetic variants and their effects 
      (instability-increasing or-decreasing) appeared to be tissue-specific and 
      repeat-specific, suggesting that somatic mutation in different tissues-or of 
      different repeats in the same tissue-proceeds independently and under the control 
      of substantially different genetic variation. Additional modifier loci included 
      DNA damage response genes ATAD5 and GADD45A . Analyzing DNA repeat expansions 
      together with clinical data showed that inherited repeats in the 5' UTR of the 
      glutaminase ( GLS) gene are associated with stage 5 chronic kidney disease 
      (OR=14.0 [5.7-34.3]) and liver diseases (OR=3.0 [1.5-5.9]). These and other 
      results point to the dynamics of DNA repeats in human populations and across the 
      human lifespan.

AB  - The Repeat Expansion Diseases (REDs) arise from the expansion of a 
      disease-specific short tandem repeat (STR). Different REDs differ with respect to 
      the repeat involved, the cells that are most expansion prone and the extent of 
      expansion. Furthermore, whether these diseases share a common expansion mechanism 
      is unclear. To date, expansion has only been studied in a limited number of REDs. 
      Here we report the first studies of the expansion mechanism in induced 
      pluripotent stem cells derived from a patient with a form of the glutaminase 
      deficiency disorder known as Global Developmental Delay, Progressive Ataxia, And 
      Elevated Glutamine (GDPAG; OMIM# 618412) caused by the expansion of a CAG-STR in 
      the 5' UTR of the glutaminase (GLS) gene. We show that alleles with as few 
      as ~ 120 repeats show detectable expansions in culture despite relatively low 
      levels of R-loops formed at this locus. Additionally, using a CRISPR-Cas9 
      knockout approach we show that PMS2 and MLH3, the constituents of MutLalpha and 
      MutLgamma, the 2 mammalian MutL complexes known to be involved in mismatch repair 
      (MMR), are essential for expansion. Furthermore, PMS1, a component of a less well 
      understood MutL complex, MutLbeta, is also important, if not essential, for repeat 
      expansion in these cells. Our results provide insights into the factors important 
      for expansion and lend weight to the idea that, despite some differences, the 
      same mechanism is responsible for expansion in many, if not all, REDs.

AB  - Tandem nucleotide repeat (TNR) expansions, particularly the CNG nucleotide 
      configuration, are associated with a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. In 
      this study, we aimed to identify novel unstable CNG repeat loci associated with 
      the neurogenetic disorder spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). Using a computational 
      approach, 15,069 CNG repeat loci in the coding and noncoding regions of the human 
      genome were identified. Based on the feature selection criteria (repeat length 
      >10 and functional location of repeats), we selected 52 repeats for further 
      analysis and evaluated the repeat length variability in 100 control subjects. A 
      subset of 19 CNG loci observed to be highly variable in control subjects was 
      selected for subsequent analysis in 100 individuals with SCA. The genes with 
      these highly variable repeats also exhibited higher gene expression levels in the 
      brain according to the tissue expression dataset (GTEx). No pathogenic expansion 
      events were identified in patient samples, which is a limitation given the size 
      of the patient group examined; however, these loci contain potential risk alleles 
      for expandability. Recent studies have implicated GLS, RAI1, GIPC1, MED15, EP400, 
      MEF2A, and CNKSR2 in neurological diseases, with GLS, GIPC1, MED15, RAI1, and 
      MEF2A sharing the same repeat loci reported in this study. This finding validates 
      the approach of evaluating repeat loci in different populations and their 
      possible implications for human pathologies.

      pluripotent stem cells derived from a patient with a form of the glutaminase 
      deficiency disorder known as Global Developmental Delay, Progressive Ataxia, And 
      Elevated Glutamine (GDPAG; OMIM# 618412) caused by the expansion of a CAG-STR in 
      the 5' UTR of the glutaminase (GLS) gene. We show that alleles with as few as 
      ~120 repeats show detectable expansions in culture despite relatively low levels 
      of R-loops formed at this locus. Additionally, using a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout 
      approach we show that PMS2 and MLH3, the constituents of MutLalpha and MutLgamma, the 2 
      mammalian MutL complexes known to be involved in mismatch repair (MMR), are 
      essential for expansion. Furthermore, PMS1, a component of a less well understood 
      MutL complex, MutLbeta, is also important, if not essential, for repeat expansion in 
      these cells. Our results provide insights into the factors important for 
      expansion and lend weight to the idea that, despite some differences, the same 
      mechanism is responsible for expansion in many, if not all, REDs.

TI  - Repeat expansions nested within tandem CNVs: a unique structural change in GLS 
      exemplifies the diagnostic challenges of non-coding pathogenic variation.
PG  - 46-54
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddac173 [doi]
AB  - Glutaminase deficiency has recently been associated with ataxia and developmental 
      delay due to repeat expansions in the 5'UTR of the glutaminase (GLS) gene. 
      Patients with the described GLS repeat expansion may indeed remain undiagnosed 
      due to the rarity of this variant, the challenge of its detection and the recency 
      of its discovery. In this study, we combined advanced bioinformatics screening of 
      ~3000 genomes and ~1500 exomes with optical genome mapping and long-read 
      sequencing for confirmation studies. We identified two GLS families, previously 
      intensely and unsuccessfully analyzed. One family carries an unusual and complex 
      structural change involving a homozygous repeat expansion nested within a 
      quadruplication event in the 5'UTR of GLS. Glutaminase deficiency and its 
      metabolic consequences were validated by in-depth biochemical analysis. The 
      identified GLS patients showed progressive early-onset ataxia, cognitive 
      deficits, pyramidal tract damage and optic atrophy, thus demonstrating 
      susceptibility of several specific neuron populations to glutaminase deficiency. 
      This large-scale screening study demonstrates the ability of bioinformatics 
      analysis-validated by latest state-of-the-art technologies (optical genome 
      mapping and long-read sequencing)-to effectively flag complex repeat expansions 
      using short-read datasets and thus facilitate diagnosis of ultra-rare disorders.

TI  - A Phase I Dose-Escalation and Expansion Study of Telaglenastat in Patients with 
      Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors.
PG  - 4994-5003
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-1204 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Glutamine is a critical fuel for solid tumors. Interference with 
      glutamine metabolism is deleterious to neoplasia in preclinical models. A phase I 
      study of the oral, first-in-class, glutaminase (GLS) inhibitor telaglenastat was 
      conducted in treatment-refractory solid tumor patients to define recommended 
      phase II dose (RP2D) and evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics 
      (PD), and antitumor activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Dose escalation by 3 + 3 
      design was followed by exploratory tumor-/biomarker-specific cohorts. RESULTS: 
      Among 120 patients, fatigue (23%) and nausea (19%) were the most common toxicity. 
      Maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Correlative analysis indicated >90% GLS 
      inhibition in platelets at plasma exposures >300 nmol/L, >75% tumoral GLS 
      inhibition, and significant increase in circulating glutamine. RP2D was defined 
      at 800 mg twice-daily. Disease control rate (DCR) was 43% across expansion 
      cohorts (overall response rate 5%, DCR 50% in renal cell carcinoma). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Telaglenastat is safe, with a favorable PK/PD profile and signal of antitumor 
      activity, supporting further clinical development.

TI  - Controlled underdilation using novel VIATORR(R) controlled expansion stents 
      improves survival after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt 
      implantation.
PG  - 100264
LID - 10.1016/j.jhepr.2021.100264 [doi]
LID - 100264
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Smaller 8-mm diameter transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic 
      shunts (TIPS) appear to be more beneficial than larger 10-mm TIPS stent-grafts, 
      but lack the ability for secondary dilation in cases of clinical ineffectiveness. 
      Underdilated VIATORR(R) TIPS stent grafts (VTS) expand passively, whereas novel 
      VIATORR Controlled Expansion (VCX) stent grafts do not. This study evaluated the 
      impact on survival of underdilated VCX compared with VTS in patients with 
      decompensated cirrhosis. METHODS: This was a prospective case-control study 
      including patients with cirrhosis receiving TIPS using 10-mm VCX underdilated to 
      8 mm. Patients with cirrhosis receiving 10-mm VTS underdilated to 8 mm were 
      matched for age, sex, indication for TIPS, and liver function. RESULTS: A total 
      of 114 patients (47 VCX, 47 VTS, and 20 fully dilated VCX/VTS) were included. 
      After TIPS implantation, underdilated VCX diameter was 8.0 (7.8-9.2) mm at a 
      median time of 359 (87-450) days, compared with VTS at 9.9 (9.7-10.0) mm (p 
      <0.001). The portosystemic pressure gradient immediately after TIPS procedure and 
      after 7 days did not change significantly in VCX [mean 9.4 (+/- 0.8) vs. 10.4 (+/- 
      0.7) mmHg, p = 0.115). Hospital readmission rates for hepatic encephalopathy were 
      23% (n = 11) vs 51% (n = 24) for VCX and VTS (p <0.001), respectively. Patients 
      with VCX had significantly lower rates of large-volume paracentesis (n = 5 [11%] 
      vs. n = 10 [21%], p = 0.017) and heart failure (n = 1 [2%] vs. n = 7 [15%], p = 
      0.015). One-year mortality for underdilated VCX and VTS was 15% (n = 7) and 30% 
      (n = 14) and, for fully dilated VCX/VTS, was 45% (n = 9) (log-rank p = 0.008), 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that VCX stent grafts 
      underdilated to 8 mm do not passively expand to nominal diameter and suggests 
      reduced hospital readmissions because of hepatic encephalopathy, uncontrolled 
      ascites, and heart failure, and improved 1-year survival compared with 
      underdilated VTS. LAY SUMMARY: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt 
      (TIPS) improves survival in selected patients with liver cirrhosis and acute 
      variceal bleeding or refractory ascites. Smaller 8-mm diameter TIPS stent grafts 
      appear to improve patient outcome compared with larger 10-mm diameter stent 
      grafts. Novel VIATORR(R) Controlled Expansion (VCX) stent grafts facilitate safe 
      and stable underdilation to 8 mm of large 10-mm diameter stent grafts with 
      improved patient outcome (survival, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites and heart 
      failure) compared with legacy VIATORR TIPS stent graft (VTS). Thus, the use of 
      underdilated VCX could preserve heart function. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: The 
      study is registered at Clinicaltrials.govNCT03628807.

TI  - Dose escalation and expansion (phase Ia/Ib) study of GLS-010, a recombinant fully 
      human antiprogrammed death-1 monoclonal antibody for advanced solid tumors or 
      lymphoma.
PG  - 1-13

AB  - BACKGROUND: GLS-010, a novel engineered fully human immunoglobin G4 monoclonal 
      antibody, can specially block the PD-1/PD-L1/2 axis and reactivate the antitumor 
      immunity. AIM: This phase Ia/Ib study was carried out to evaluate the safety, 
      recommended phase II dose (R2PD), and primary antitumor effects of GLS-010 in 
      patients with advanced, refractory lymphoma and solid tumors. METHODS: In phase 
      Ia study, patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphoma enrolled and 
      received GLS-010 at a dose of 1, 4, or 10 mg/kg Q2W; 240 mg Q3W or Q2W. The 
      primary objective was to assess the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). In phase Ib 
      study, doses were expanded in 9 specific tumors to ensure the R2PD and explore 
      the efficacy. Tumor mutation burden level and PD-L1 expression were also assessed 
      with whole-exome sequencing and immunohistochemistry (SP263), respectively. 
      RESULTS: Up to April 18, 2020, a total of 289 patients (n = 24, phase Ia; 
      n = 265, phase Ib) were enrolled. DLT was not observed in phase Ia part. The 
      T(1/2), CL(ss), and V(d) were similar among all dose groups and different tumors. 
      The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were anemia, 
      leukopenia, elevated alanine aminotransaminase/asparate aminotransferase 
      (ALT/AST), and elevated bilirubin. And hypothyroidism was the most common 
      immune-related adverse event (irAE). The incidence of grade >/=3 TEAE was 39.8%, 
      while grade >/=3 irAE was only 4.5%. Based on safety studies, 
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and preclinical data, 240-mg Q2W was 
      recommended as the expansion dose. The overall objective response rate was 23.6%, 
      with 10 patients achieving complete response. Patients with a high PD-L1 
      expression level (31.3% Versus. 13.7%, p = 0.012) or t-issue tumor mutation 
      burden level (31.3% Versus. 5.6%, p = 0.009) showed a significantly better 
      response. CONCLUSION: GLS-010 showed acceptable safety profile and favorable 
      clinical response. The dose of 240 mg Q2W was an optimal recommended dose as 
      monotherapy.

TI  - Genome-wide survey of tandem repeats by nanopore sequencing shows that 
      disease-associated repeats are more polymorphic in the general population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tandem repeats are highly mutable and contribute to the development 
      of human disease by a variety of mechanisms. It is difficult to predict which 
      tandem repeats may cause a disease. One hypothesis is that changeable tandem 
      repeats are the source of genetic diseases, because disease-causing repeats are 
      polymorphic in healthy individuals. However, it is not clear whether 
      disease-causing repeats are more polymorphic than other repeats. METHODS: We 
      performed a genome-wide survey of the millions of human tandem repeats using 
      publicly available long read genome sequencing data from 21 humans. We measured 
      tandem repeat copy number changes using tandem-genotypes. Length variation of 
      known disease-associated repeats was compared to other repeat loci. RESULTS: We 
      found that known Mendelian disease-causing or disease-associated repeats, 
      especially CAG and 5'UTR GGC repeats, are relatively long and polymorphic in the 
      general population. We also show that repeat lengths of two disease-causing 
      tandem repeats, in ATXN3 and GLS, are correlated with near-by GWAS SNP genotypes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We provide a catalog of polymorphic tandem repeats across a variety 
      of repeat unit lengths and sequences, from long read sequencing data. This method 
      especially if used in genome wide association study, may indicate possible new 
      candidates of pathogenic or biologically important tandem repeats in human 
      genomes.

TI  - Glutaminase Deficiency Caused by Short Tandem Repeat Expansion in GLS.
PG  - 1433-1441
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1806627 [doi]
AB  - We report an inborn error of metabolism caused by an expansion of a GCA-repeat 
      tract in the 5' untranslated region of the gene encoding glutaminase (GLS) that 
      was identified through detailed clinical and biochemical phenotyping, combined 
      with whole-genome sequencing. The expansion was observed in three unrelated 
      patients who presented with an early-onset delay in overall development, 
      progressive ataxia, and elevated levels of glutamine. In addition to ataxia, one 
      patient also showed cerebellar atrophy. The expansion was associated with a 
      relative deficiency of GLS messenger RNA transcribed from the expanded allele, 
      which probably resulted from repeat-mediated chromatin changes upstream of the 
      GLS repeat. Our discovery underscores the importance of careful examination of 
      regions of the genome that are typically excluded from or poorly captured by 
      exome sequencing.

TI  - Pure red cell aplasia associated with expansion of CD3+ CD8+ granular lymphocytes 
      expressing cytotoxicity against HLA-E+ cells.
PG  - 147-53
AB  - T-cell granular lymphocyte-proliferative disorder (T-GLPD) is characterized by 
      the proliferation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and is often associated with pure 
      red cell aplasia (PRCA). The mechanism involved in the development of PRCA in 
      T-GLPD is unknown. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 20 
      patients with T-GLPD. Ten patients had associated PRCA. Granular lymphocytes 
      (GLs) of T-GLPD are positive for CD94, but not NKG2A. To clarify the functional 
      role of CD94 in T-GLPD, we performed a cytotoxicity assay against the trophoblast 
      cell line, BeWo, which is known to express human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-E, a 
      natural ligand of CD94, and is deficient in other HLA class I and class II 
      antigens. GLs isolated from T-GLPD with PRCA patients killed BeWo cells more 
      significantly than GLs from T-GLPD without PRCA patients. Furthermore, GLs from 
      T-GLPD with PRCA were significantly stimulated by a monoclonal antibody against 
      CD94, whereas those of T-GLPD without PRCA were not. Taken together, HLA-E, a 
      ligand of CD94, was suggested to stimulate CD94+ cells to kill HLA-E+ cells in 
      T-GLPD with PRCA. GLs of T-GLPD with PRCA have a potential positive activity 
      against HLA-E+ cells, whereas GLs from T-GLPD without PRCA do not. CD94 may play 
      a key role in the pathogenesis of PRCA in T-GLPD.

TI  - Isolation of a cDNA clone encoding a KATP channel-like protein expressed in 
      insulin-secreting cells, localization of the human gene to chromosome band 
      21q22.1, and linkage studies with NIDDM.
PG  - 592-6
AB  - The metabolism of glucose in insulin-secreting cells leads to closure of 
      ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP), an event that initiates the insulin secretory 
      process. Defects in insulin secretion are a common feature of 
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and the beta-cell KATP that 
      couples metabolism and membrane potential is a candidate for contributing to the 
      development of this clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. We 
      screened a hamster insulinoma cDNA library by low-stringency hybridization with a 
      probe coding for the G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channel GIRK1/KGA 
      and isolated clones encoding a protein, KATP-2, whose sequence is 90% similar to 
      that of the recently described KATP-1, an ATP-sensitive K+ channel expressed in 
      heart and other tissues. RNA blotting showed that KATP mRNA was present in 
      insulin-secreting cells and brain but not in heart. To assess the contribution of 
      KATP-2 to the development of NIDDM, the human KATP-2 gene (symbol KCNJ7) was 
      isolated and mapped to chromosome band 21q22.1 by fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization. A simple tandem repeat DNA polymorphism, D21S1255, was identified 
      in the region of the KATP-2 gene, and linkage studies between this marker and 
      NIDDM were carried out in a group of Mexican-American sib pairs with NIDDM. There 
      was no evidence for linkage between D21S1255 and NIDDM, indicating that KATP-2 is 
      not a major susceptibility gene in this population.
