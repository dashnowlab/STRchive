TI  - Holoprosencephaly due to mutations in ZIC2: alanine tract expansion mutations may 
      be caused by parental somatic recombination.
PG  - 791-6
AB  - We report on the prevalence of mutations in the zinc finger transcription factor 
      gene, ZIC2, in a group of 509 unrelated individuals with isolated 
      holoprosencephaly (HPE) and normal chromosomes. Overall, we encountered 16 HPE 
      patients (from 15 unrelated families) with ZIC2 mutations. Thus, ZIC2 mutation 
      was the apparent cause of HPE in 3-4% of cases. Seven mutations were frameshifts 
      that were predicted to result in loss of function, further supporting the idea 
      that ZIC2 haploinsufficiency can result in HPE. One mutation, an alanine tract 
      expansion which is caused by the expansion of an imperfect trinucleotide repeat, 
      occurred in seven patients from six different families. In three of those 
      families, the father was found to be apparently mosaic for the mutation. We 
      hypothesize that this mutation can arise through errors in somatic recombination, 
      an extremely unusual mutation mechanism. In addition, one mutation resulted in a 
      single amino acid change and one mutation was an in-frame deletion of 12 amino 
      acids. The central nervous system malformations seen in patients with ZIC2 
      mutations ranged from alobar HPE (most common) to middle interhemispheric fusion 
      defect (one case). Although severe facial anomalies are common in HPE, all of the 
      patients with ZIC2 mutations had relatively normal faces, suggesting that ZIC2 
      mutations represent a large proportion of HPE cases without facial malformation.
