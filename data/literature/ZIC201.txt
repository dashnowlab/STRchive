AB  - BACKGROUND: Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is an X-linked disorder caused 
      by pathogenic variants in the SLC16A2 gene. Although most reported variants are 
      found in protein-coding regions or adjacent junctions, structural variations 
      (SVs) within non-coding regions have not been previously reported. METHODS: We 
      investigated two male siblings with severe neurodevelopmental disorders and 
      spasticity, who had remained undiagnosed for over a decade and were negative from 
      exome sequencing, utilizing long-read HiFi genome sequencing. We conducted a 
      comprehensive analysis including short-tandem repeats (STRs) and SVs to identify 
      the genetic cause in this familial case. RESULTS: While coding variant and STR 
      analyses yielded negative results, SV analysis revealed a novel hemizygous 
      deletion in intron 1 of the SLC16A2 gene (chrX:74,460,691 - 74,463,566; 
      2,876 bp), inherited from their carrier mother and shared by the siblings. 
      Determination of the breakpoints indicates that the deletion probably resulted 
      from Alu/Alu-mediated rearrangements between homologous AluY pairs. The deleted 
      region is predicted to include multiple transcription factor binding sites, such 
      as Stat2, Zic1, Zic2, and FOXD3, which are crucial for the neurodevelopmental 
      process, as well as a regulatory element including an eQTL (rs1263181) that is 
      implicated in the tissue-specific regulation of SLC16A2 expression, notably in 
      skeletal muscle and thyroid tissues. CONCLUSIONS: This report, to our knowledge, 
      is the first to describe a non-coding deletion associated with AHDS, 
      demonstrating the potential utility of long-read sequencing for undiagnosed 
      patients. Although interpreting variants in non-coding regions remains 
      challenging, our study highlights this region as a high priority for future 
      investigation and functional studies.

TI  - Holoprosencephaly due to mutations in ZIC2: alanine tract expansion mutations may 
      be caused by parental somatic recombination.
PG  - 791-6
AB  - We report on the prevalence of mutations in the zinc finger transcription factor 
      gene, ZIC2, in a group of 509 unrelated individuals with isolated 
      holoprosencephaly (HPE) and normal chromosomes. Overall, we encountered 16 HPE 
      patients (from 15 unrelated families) with ZIC2 mutations. Thus, ZIC2 mutation 
      was the apparent cause of HPE in 3-4% of cases. Seven mutations were frameshifts 
      that were predicted to result in loss of function, further supporting the idea 
      that ZIC2 haploinsufficiency can result in HPE. One mutation, an alanine tract 
      expansion which is caused by the expansion of an imperfect trinucleotide repeat, 
      occurred in seven patients from six different families. In three of those 
      families, the father was found to be apparently mosaic for the mutation. We 
      hypothesize that this mutation can arise through errors in somatic recombination, 
      an extremely unusual mutation mechanism. In addition, one mutation resulted in a 
      single amino acid change and one mutation was an in-frame deletion of 12 amino 
      acids. The central nervous system malformations seen in patients with ZIC2 
      mutations ranged from alobar HPE (most common) to middle interhemispheric fusion 
      defect (one case). Although severe facial anomalies are common in HPE, all of the 
      patients with ZIC2 mutations had relatively normal faces, suggesting that ZIC2 
      mutations represent a large proportion of HPE cases without facial malformation.
