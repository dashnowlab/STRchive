AB  - There is an obvious clinical-pathological overlap between essential tremor and 
      some known tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansion disorders. The aim is 
      to analyse whether these short tandem repeat genes, including ATXN1, ATXN2, 
      ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7, ATXN8OS, ATXN10, PPP2R2B, TBP, BEAN1, NOP56, DAB1, ATN1, 
      SADM12 and FMR1, are associated with familial essential tremor patients. Genetic 
      analysis of repeat sizes in tremor-associated short tandem repeat expansions was 
      performed in a large cohort of 515 familial essential tremor probands and 300 
      controls. The demographic and clinical features among carriers of pathogenic 
      expansions, intermediate repeats and non-carriers were compared. A total of 18 
      out of 515 (18/515, 3.7%) patients were found to have repeats expansions, 
      including 12 cases (12/515, 2.5%) with intermediate repeat expansions (one ATXN1, 
      eight TBP, two FMR1, one ATN1), and six cases (6/515, 1.2%) with pathogenic 
      expansions (one ATXN1, one ATXN2, one ATXN8OS, one PPP2R2B, one FMR1, one 
      SAMD12). There were no statistically significant differences in intermediate 
      repeats compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, there were no significant 
      differences in demographics and clinical features among individuals with 
      pathogenic expansions, intermediate repeat expansions carriers and non-carriers. 
      Our study indicates that the intermediate repeat expansion in tremor-associated 
      short tandem repeat expansions does not pose an increased risk for essential 
      tremor, and rare pathogenic expansion carriers have been found in the familial 
      essential tremor cohort. The diagnosis of essential tremor based solely on 
      clinical symptoms remains a challenge in distinguishing it from known short 
      tandem repeat expansions diseases with overlapping clinical-pathological 
      features.

TI  - Whole Exome Sequencing Indicating GGCCTG Hexanucleotide Repeat in Patients with 
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 36.
PG  - 71-79

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36) is caused by large GGCCTG 
      repeat expansion in the NOP56 gene. The genetic diagnosis based on Southern blot 
      is expensive and time-consuming. This study aimed to evaluate the reliability and 
      effectiveness of whole exome sequencing (WES) for routine genetic diagnosis of 
      suspected SCA36 patients. METHODS: Pathogenic repeat expansions for SCAs 
      including SCA36 were first analyzed based on WES data using ExpansionHunter in 
      five probands from SCA families, then the results were confirmed by triplet 
      repeat primed polymerase chain reaction (TP-PCR) and Southern blot. RESULTS: 
      GGCCTG repeat expansion in NOP56 was indicated in all five probands by WES, then 
      it was found in 11 SCA patients and three asymptomatic individuals by TP-PCR. The 
      sizes of GGCCTG repeat expansions were confirmed to be 1,390-1,556 by Southern 
      blot. The mean age at onset of the patients was 51.0 +/- 9.3 (ranging from 41 to 
      71), and they presented slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, atrophy and 
      fasciculation in tongue or limb muscles. CONCLUSION: The patients were clinically 
      and genetically diagnosed as SCA36. This study proposed that WES could be a 
      rapid, reliable, and cost-effective routine test for the preliminarily detection 
      of SCA36 and other ataxia diseases.

AB  - Hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a group of clinically and genetically 
      heterogeneous inherited disorders characterized by slowly progressive cerebellar 
      ataxia. We ascertained a Japanese pedigree with autosomal dominant SCA comprising 
      four family members, including two patients. We identified a GGCCTG repeat 
      expansion of intron 1 in the NOP56 gene by Southern blotting, resulting in a 
      molecular diagnosis of SCA36. RNA sequencing using peripheral blood revealed that 
      the expression of genes involved in ribosomal organization and translation was 
      decreased in patients carrying the GGCCTG repeat expansion. Genes involved in 
      pathways associated with ribosomal organization and translation were enriched and 
      differentially expressed in the patients. We propose a novel hypothesis that the 
      GGCCTG repeat expansion contributes to the pathogenesis of SCA36 by causing a 
      global disruption of translation resulting from ribosomal dysfunction.

TI  - Investigating Repeat Expansions in NIPA1, NOP56, and NOTCH2NLC Genes: A Closer 
      Look at Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Patients from Southern Italy.
LID - 10.3390/cells13080677 [doi]
LID - 677
AB  - The discovery of hexanucleotide repeats expansion (RE) in Chromosome 9 Open 
      Reading frame 72 (C9orf72) as the major genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) and the association between intermediate repeats in Ataxin-2 
      (ATXN2) with the disorder suggest that repetitive sequences in the human genome 
      play a significant role in ALS pathophysiology. Investigating the frequency of 
      repeat expansions in ALS in different populations and ethnic groups is therefore 
      of great importance. Based on these premises, this study aimed to define the 
      frequency of REs in the NIPA1, NOP56, and NOTCH2NLC genes and the possible 
      associations between phenotypes and the size of REs in the Italian population. 
      Using repeat-primed-PCR and PCR-fragment analyses, we screened 302 
      El-Escorial-diagnosed ALS patients and compared the RE distribution to 167 age-, 
      gender-, and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. While the REs distribution was 
      similar between the ALS and control groups, a moderate association was observed 
      between longer RE lengths and clinical features such as age at onset, gender, 
      site of onset, and family history. In conclusion, this is the first study to 
      screen ALS patients from southern Italy for REs in NIPA1, NOP56, and NOTCH2NLC 
      genes, contributing to our understanding of ALS genetics. Our results highlighted 
      that the extremely rare pathogenic REs in these genes do not allow an association 
      with the disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) is a neurological disease characterized by 
      action tremor in upper arms. Although its high heritability and prevalence 
      worldwide, its etiology and association with other diseases are still unknown. 
      METHOD: We investigated 10 common spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), including SCA1, 
      SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, SCA17, SCA36, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA) in 92 early-onset familial ET pedigrees in China collected from 
      2016 to 2022. RESULT: We found one SCA12 proband carried 51 CAG repeats within 
      PPP2R2B gene and one SCA3 proband with intermediate CAG repeats (55) with ATXN3 
      gene. The other 90 ET probands all had normal repeat expansions. CONCLUSION: 
      Tremor can be the initial phenotype of certain SCA. For early-onset, familial ET 
      patients, careful physical examinations are needed before genetic SCA screening.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias form a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia. Their 
      prevalence varies among populations and ethnicities. Spinocerebellar ataxia 36 is 
      caused by a GGCCTG repeat expansion in the first intron of the NOP56 gene and is 
      characterized by late-onset ataxia, sensorineural hearing loss and upper and 
      lower motor neuron signs, including tongue fasciculations. Spinocerebellar ataxia 
      36 has been described mainly in East Asian and Western European patients and was 
      thought to be absent in the British population. Leveraging novel bioinformatic 
      tools to detect repeat expansions from whole-genome sequencing, we analyse the 
      NOP56 repeat in 1257 British patients with hereditary ataxia and in 7506 
      unrelated controls. We identify pathogenic repeat expansions in five families 
      (seven patients), representing the first cohort of White British descent patients 
      with spinocerebellar ataxia 36. Employing in silico approaches using whole-genome 
      sequencing data, we found an 87 kb shared haplotype in among the affected 
      individuals from five families around the NOP56 repeat region, although this 
      block was also shared between several controls, suggesting that the repeat arises 
      on a permissive haplotype. Clinically, the patients presented with slowly 
      progressive cerebellar ataxia with a low rate of hearing loss and variable rates 
      of motor neuron impairment. Our findings show that the NOP56 expansion causes 
      ataxia in the British population and that spinocerebellar ataxia 36 can be 
      suspected in patients with a late-onset, slowly progressive ataxia, even without 
      the findings of hearing loss and tongue fasciculation.

PG  - 992-997
LID - 10.1002/mdc3.13740 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36) is caused by 
      hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the NOP56 gene. OBJECTIVES: To assess 
      frequency, clinical and genetic features of SCA36 in Eastern Spain. METHODS: 
      NOP56 expansion was tested in a cohort of undiagnosed cerebellar ataxia families 
      (n = 84). Clinical characterization and haplotype studies were performed. 
      RESULTS: SCA36 was identified in 37 individuals from 16 unrelated families. It 
      represented 5.4% of hereditary ataxia patients. The majority were originally from 
      the same region and displayed a shared haplotype. Mean age at onset was 
      52.5 years. Non-ataxic features included: hypoacusis (67.9%), pyramidal signs 
      (46.4%), lingual fasciculations/atrophy (25%), dystonia (17.8%), and parkinsonism 
      with evidence of dopaminergic denervation (10.7%). CONCLUSIONS: SCA36 is a 
      frequent cause of hereditary ataxia in Eastern Spain, and is associated with a 
      strong founder effect. SCA36 analysis should be considered prior to other 
      studies, especially in AD presentations. Parkinsonism reported here broadens 
      SCA36 clinical spectrum.

AB  - Introduction: Spinocerebellar ataxias 36 (SCA36) is the neurodegenerative disease 
      caused by the GGCCTG Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in NOP56, which is too long 
      to sequence using short-read sequencing. Single molecule real time (SMRT) 
      sequencing can sequence across disease-causing repeat expansion. We report the 
      first long-read sequencing data across the expansion region in SCA36. Methods: We 
      collected and described the clinical manifestations and imaging features of Han 
      Chinese pedigree with three generations of SCA36. Also, we focused on structural 
      variation analysis for intron 1 of the NOP56 gene by SMRT sequencing in the 
      assembled genome. Results: The main clinical features of this pedigree are 
      late-onset ataxia symptoms, with a presymptomatic presence of affective and sleep 
      disorders. In addition, the results of SMRT sequencing showed the specific repeat 
      expansion region and demonstrated that the region was not composed of single 
      GGCCTG hexanucleotides and there were random interruptions. Discussion: We 
      extended the phenotypic spectrum of SCA36. We applied SMRT sequencing to reveal 
      the correlation between genotype and phenotype of SCA36. Our findings indicated 
      that long-read sequencing is well suited to characterize known repeat expansion.

AB  - Usually, molecular diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia is based on a step-by-step 
      approach with targeted sizing of four repeat expansions accounting for most 
      dominant cases, then targeted sequencing of other genes. Nowadays, genome 
      sequencing allows detection of most pathogenic variants in a single step. The 
      ExpansionHunter tool can detect expansions in short-read genome sequencing data. 
      Recent studies have shown that ExpansionHunter can also be used to identify 
      repeat expansions in exome sequencing data. We tested ExpansionHunter on 
      spinocerebellar ataxia exomes in a research context as a second-line analysis, 
      after exclusion of main CAG repeat expansions in half of the probands. First, we 
      confirmed the detection of expansions in seven known expansion carriers and then, 
      after targeted analysis of ATXN1, 2, 3 and 7, CACNA1A, TBP, ATN1, NOP56, AR and 
      HTT in 498 exomes, we found 22 additional pathogenic expansions. Comparison with 
      capillary migration sizing in 247 individuals and confirmation of all expanded 
      alleles detected by ExpansionHunter demonstrated that for these loci, sensitivity 
      and specificity reached 100%. ExpansionHunter detected but underestimated the 
      repeat size for larger expansions, and the normal alleles distribution at each 
      locus should be taken into account to detect expansions. Exome combined with 
      ExpansionHunter is reliable to detect repeat expansions in selected loci as 
      first-line analysis in spinocerebellar ataxia.

AB  - SCA36 is a neurodegenerative disease mainly caused by the abnormal expansion of 
      the GGGCCT repeat sequence in intron 1 of NOP56. The RNA sequences of this gene 
      are expected to form large amounts of G-quadruplexes in the cytoplasm, which may 
      be a potential intervention and detection target for SCA36. Here, we have 
      developed a small-molecular compound named TCB-1, which shows good selectivity to 
      the G-quadruplex structure, and its fluorescence can be enhanced by hundreds of 
      folds. Interestingly, TCB-1 can avoid lysosome capture, evenly disperse in the 
      cytoplasm, and selectively light up the cytoplasmic RNA G-quadruplexes. This 
      property allows TCB-1 to sensitively detect the increased formation of 
      cytoplasmic RNA G-quadruplexes in SCA36 model cells. This work not only provides 
      new ideas for the design of small-molecule compounds targeting RNA G-quadruplexes 
      in living cells, but also intuitively demonstrates the increased formation of RNA 
      G-quadruplexes caused by NOP56 gene mutation, providing a possible tool for the 
      detection of SCA36.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic efficacy of clinical 
      exome-targeted sequencing (CES) and spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36) screening 
      in a real-life cohort of patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) from Eastern Spain. 
      METHODS: A total of 130 unrelated patients with CA, negative for common 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA7, SCA8, SCA12, 
      SCA17, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA], and Friedreich ataxia), were 
      studied with CES. Bioinformatic and genotype-phenotype analyses were performed to 
      assess the pathogenicity of the variants encountered. Copy number variants were 
      analyzed when appropriate. In undiagnosed dominant and sporadic cases, repeat 
      primed PCR was used to screen for the presence of a repeat expansion in the NOP56 
      gene. RESULTS: CES identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 50 
      families (39%), including 23 novel variants. Overall, there was a high genetic 
      heterogeneity, and the most frequent genetic diagnosis was SPG7 (n = 15), 
      followed by SETX (n = 6), CACNA1A (n = 5), POLR3A (n = 4), and SYNE1 (n = 3). In 
      addition, 17 families displayed likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants in 14 
      different genes: KCND3 (n = 2), KIF1C (n = 2), CYP27A1A (n = 2), AFG3L2 (n = 1), 
      ANO10 (n = 1), CAPN1 (n = 1), CWF19L1 (n = 1), ITPR1 (n = 1), KCNA1 (n = 1), OPA1 
      (n = 1), PNPLA6 (n = 1), SPG11 (n = 1), SPTBN2 (n = 1), and TPP1 (n = 1). 
      Twenty-two novel variants were characterized. SCA36 was diagnosed in 11 families, 
      all with autosomal dominant (AD) presentation. SCA36 screening increased the 
      total diagnostic rate to 47% (n = 61/130). Ultimately, undiagnosed patients 
      showed delayed age at onset (p < 0.05) and were more frequently sporadic. 
      DISCUSSION: Our study provides insight into the genetic landscape of CA in 
      Eastern Spain. Although CES was an effective approach to capture genetic 
      heterogeneity, most patients remained undiagnosed. SCA36 was found to be a 
      relatively frequent form and, therefore, should be tested prior to CES in 
      familial AD presentations in particular geographical regions.

TI  - The Clinical and Polynucleotide Repeat Expansion Analysis of ATXN2, NOP56, AR and

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repeat expansions, including those in C9orf72 and ATXN2, have been 
      implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, there have been few 
      studies on the association of AR and NOP56 repeat expansion with ALS, especially 
      in China. Accordingly, we aimed to evaluate the frequency of C9orf72 and ATXN2 
      repeat mutations and investigate whether NOP56 and AR repeat expansion are risk 
      factors for ALS. METHODS: In this study, 736 ALS patients and several hundred 
      healthy controls were recruited. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 
      repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR) were performed to determine the repeat lengths in 
      C9orf72, ATXN2, AR, and NOP56. RESULTS: GGGGCC repeats in C9orf72 were observed 
      in six ALS patients (0.8%, 6/736) but not in any of the controls (0/365). The 
      patients with pathogenic GGGGCC repeats showed shorter median survival times than 
      those with a normal genotype (p = 0.006). Regarding ATXN2 CAG repeats, we 
      identified that intermediate repeat lengths (29-34 copies) were associated with 
      ALS (p = 0.033), and there was no difference in clinical characteristics between 
      the groups with and without intermediate repeats (p > 0.05). Meanwhile, we 
      observed that there was no association between the repeat size in AR and NOP56 
      and ALS (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that pathogenetic 
      repeats in C9orf72 are rare in China, while intermediate CAG repeats in ATXN2 are 
      more frequent but have no effect on disease phenotypes; the repeat size in AR and 
      NOP56 may not be a risk factor for ALS.

AB  - Expansion of d(GGCCTG)(n) hexanucleotide repeats in the NOP56 gene is the genetic 
      cause of spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36) which is an inheritable 
      neurodegenerative disease. Non-B DNA is known to be the structural intermediate 
      causing repeat expansions. Yet, the structure and mechanism of genetic 
      instability of d(GGCCTG)(n) repeats remain elusive. In this work, we investigated 
      the solution structures of sequences containing two to eight GGCCTG repeats using 
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. They were found to form diverse 
      secondary structures, including hairpin, duplex and G-quadruplex (G4). 
      Intriguingly, the hairpin structure was present in all the investigated 
      sequences. The NMR solution structure of the hairpin formed by d(GGCCTG)(2) was 
      determined, disclosing an unprecedented CCTGGG hexanucleotide loop in which the 
      first and sixth loop residues formed a Watson-Crick loop-closing base pair, the 
      second and third loop residues stacked in the major groove, whereas the fourth 
      and fifth loop residues formed a G.G mismatch. Apart from the hairpin, 
      antiparallel G4 and palindromic duplex structures were found to form in 
      d(GGCCTG)(2) and d(GGCCTG)(3)(-)(8), respectively. Results of this work provide 
      new insights into the genetic instability of d(GGCCTG)(n) repeats and 
      structure-based drug design for SCA36.

TI  - Repeats expansions in ATXN2, NOP56, NIPA1 and ATXN1 are not associated with ALS 
      in Africans.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized primarily by progressive loss of motor neurons. Although ALS occurs 
      worldwide and the frequency and spectrum of identifiable genetic causes of 
      disease varies across populations, very few studies have included African 
      subjects. In addition to a hexanucleotide repeat expansion (RE) in C9orf72, the 
      most common genetic cause of ALS in Europeans, REs in ATXN2, NIPA1 and ATXN1 have 
      shown variable associations with ALS in Europeans. Intermediate range expansions 
      in some of these genes (e.g. ATXN2) have been reported as potential risk factors, 
      or phenotypic modifiers, of ALS. Pathogenic expansions in NOP56 cause 
      spinocerebellar ataxia-36, which can present with prominent motor neuron 
      degeneration. Here we compare REs in these genes in a cohort of Africans with ALS 
      and population controls using whole genome sequencing data. Targeting genotyping 
      of short tandem repeats at known loci within ATXN2, NIPA1, ATXN1 and NOP56 was 
      performed using ExpansionHunter software in 105 Southern African (SA) patients 
      with ALS. African population controls were from an in-house SA population control 
      database (n = 25), the SA Human Genome Program (n = 24), the Simons Genome 
      Diversity Project (n = 39) and the Illumina Polaris Diversity Cohort (IPDC) 
      dataset (n = 50). We found intermediate RE alleles in ATXN2 (27-33 repeats) and 
      ATXN1 (33-35 repeats), and NIPA1 long alleles (>/=8 repeats) were rare in Africans, 
      and not associated with ALS (p > 0.17). NOP56 showed no expanded alleles in 
      either ALS or controls. We also compared the differences in allele distributions 
      between the African and n = 50 European controls (from the IPDC). There was a 
      statistical significant difference in the distribution of the REs in the ATXN1 
      between African and European controls (Chi-test p < 0.001), and NIPA1 showed 
      proportionately more longer alleles (RE > 8) in Europeans vs. Africans (Fisher's 
      p = 0.016). The distribution of RE alleles in ATXN2 and NOP56 were similar 
      amongst African and European controls. In conclusion, repeat expansions in ATXN2, 
      NIPA1 and ATXN1, which showed associations with ALS in Europeans, were not 
      replicated in Southern Africans with ALS.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36) is a noncoding repeat expansion disorder 
      caused by an expanded GGCCTG hexanucleotide repeat (HNR) in the first intron of 
      the nucleolar protein 56 (NOP56) gene. Another disease-causing HNR expansion 
      derived from C9orf72-linked GGGGCC repeats that form G-quadruplexes (GQs) affects 
      genetic stability, RNA splicing, and mRNA localization within neurites. The 
      porphyrin derivative TMPyP4 was shown to ameliorate RNA toxicity caused by GGGGCC 
      HNR expansion by binding and distorting RNA GQ structures. SCA36 GGCCTG HNRs can 
      potentially form RNA GQs; therefore, we investigated whether several porphyrin 
      derivatives could reduce RNA toxicity in SCA36 cell models. Among these, sodium 
      copper chlorophyllin and hemin chloride, which have already been used in clinical 
      practice, reduced SCA36 GGCCTG expansion-mediated cytotoxicity and improved cell 
      viability. These data suggest that porphyrins are potential therapeutic 
      candidates against SCA36 pathogenesis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the GGC repeats in the NOTCH2NLC gene contribute 
      to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). METHODS: In this study, 545 patients with 
      ALS and 1,305 healthy controls from mainland China were recruited. Several 
      pathogenic mutations in known ALS-causative genes (including C9ORF72 and ATXN2) 
      and polynucleotide repeat expansions in NOP56 and AR genes were excluded. 
      Repeat-primed PCR and GC-rich PCR were performed to determine the GGC repeat size 
      in NOTCH2NLC. Systematic and targeted clinical evaluations and investigations, 
      including skin biopsy and dynamic electrophysiologic studies, were conducted in 
      the genetically affected patients. RESULTS: GGC repeat expansion was observed in 
      4 patients (numbers of repeats 44, 54, 96, and 143), accounting for  approximately 0.73% (4 of 
      545) of all patients with ALS. A comparison with 1,305 healthy controls revealed 
      that GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC was associated with ALS (Fisher exact 
      test, 4 of 545 vs 0 of 1,305, p = 0.007). Compared to patients with the neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) muscle weakness-dominant subtype, patients 
      with ALS phenotype carrying the abnormal repeat expansion tended to have a severe 
      phenotype and rapid deterioration. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ALS is a 
      specific phenotype of NIID or that GGC expansion in NOTCH2NLC is a factor that 
      modifies ALS. These findings may help clarify the pathogenic mechanism of ALS and 
      may expand the known clinical spectrum of NIID.

LID - 10.1002/mds.28105 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias are often caused by expansions of short 
      tandem repeats. Recent methodological advances have made repeat expansion (RE) 
      detection with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) feasible. OBJECTIVES: The objective 
      of this study was to determine the genetic basis of ataxia in a multigenerational 
      Australian pedigree with autosomal-dominant inheritance. METHODS AND RESULTS: WGS 
      was performed on 3 affected relatives. The sequence data were screened for known 
      pathogenic REs using 2 RE detection tools: exSTRa and ExpansionHunter. This 
      screen provided a clear and rapid diagnosis (<5 days from receiving the 
      sequencing data) of spinocerebellar ataxia 36, a rare form of ataxia caused by an 
      intronic GGCCTG RE in NOP56. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of rare ataxias caused by 
      REs is highly feasible and cost-effective with WGS. We propose that WGS could 
      potentially be implemented as the frontline, cost-effective methodology for the 
      molecular testing of individuals with a clinical diagnosis of ataxia. (c) 2020

AB  - GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansions (HREs) in C9orf72 cause amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and lead to the 
      production of aggregating dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) via repeat associated 
      non-AUG (RAN) translation. Here, we show the similar intronic GGCCTG HREs that 
      causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36) is also translated into DPRs, 
      including poly(GP) and poly(PR). We demonstrate that poly(GP) is more abundant in 
      SCA36 compared to c9ALS/FTD patient tissue due to canonical AUG-mediated 
      translation from intron-retained GGCCTG repeat RNAs. However, the frequency of 
      the antisense RAN translation product poly(PR) is comparable between c9ALS/FTD 
      and SCA36 patient samples. Interestingly, in SCA36 patient tissue, poly(GP) 
      exists as a soluble species, and no TDP-43 pathology is present. We show that 
      aggregate-prone chimeric DPR (cDPR) species underlie the divergent DPR pathology 
      between c9ALS/FTD and SCA36. These findings reveal key differences in 
      translation, solubility, and protein aggregation of DPRs between c9ALS/FTD and 
      SCA36.

AB  - A G(4)C(2) hexanucleotide repeat expansion in an intron of C9orf72 is the most 
      common cause of frontal temporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
      (c9FTD/ALS). A remarkably similar intronic TG(3)C(2) repeat expansion is 
      associated with spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36). Both expansions are widely 
      expressed, form RNA foci, and can undergo repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) 
      translation to form similar dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). Yet, these diseases 
      result in the degeneration of distinct subsets of neurons. We show that the 
      expression of these repeat expansions in mice is sufficient to recapitulate the 
      unique features of each disease, including this selective neuronal vulnerability. 
      Furthermore, only the G(4)C(2) repeat induces the formation of aberrant stress 
      granules and pTDP-43 inclusions. Overall, our results demonstrate that the 
      pathomechanisms responsible for each disease are intrinsic to the individual 
      repeat sequence, highlighting the importance of sequence-specific RNA-mediated 
      toxicity in each disorder.

PG  - 501-509
LID - 10.1007/s12311-020-01110-0 [doi]
AB  - SCA36 is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) affecting many 
      families from Costa da Morte, a northwestern region of Spain. It is caused by an 
      intronic GGCCTG repeat expansion in NOP56. In order to characterize the cognitive 
      and affective manifestations of this cerebellar disease, a group of 30 SCA36 
      mutation carriers (11 preataxic and 19 ataxic patients) were assessed with a 
      comprehensive battery of standardized tests. Phonological verbal fluency - but 
      not semantic fluency - was already mildly impaired in preataxic subjects. In 
      ataxic patients, both phonological and semantic fluencies were significantly 
      below normal. Depression, while more frequent and prominent in ataxic patients, 
      was also often present in the preataxic stage. This is the first systematic study 
      supporting the presence of a mild cerebellar cognitive and affective syndrome in 
      SCA36. Routine evaluation of cognitive and emotional spheres in SCA36 patients as 
      well as asymptomatic mutation carriers should allow early detection and timely 
      therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10): Mutation analysis and common haplotype 
      based inference suggest its rarity in Indian population.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is a rare autosomal dominant cerebellar 
      ataxia caused by nucleotide ATTCT expansion in ATXN10 gene. SCA10 has been 
      reported in patients of cerebellar ataxia from Amerindian/Latin America and in 
      East Asian ancestry. A common founder has been ascribed to the origin of ATTCT 
      repeat expansion mutation in both the population. Here we present our 
      investigation of the SCA10 pentanucleotide repeat expansion in 461 SCA patients 
      of the Indian population. The analysis of multi-ethnic at-risk haplotype 
      C-(ATTCT)n-GGC was performed using genotype data of various ethnic population 
      included in the 1000 Genomes Project (KGP) to infer the prevalence of at-risk 
      haplotype in the Indian populations. Unsurprisingly, none of the patient's DNA 
      samples with (ATTCT)n expansion was observed in pathological range, however, the 
      observed normal range of (ATTCT)n was 8-22 repeats, suggesting very rare or 
      absence of the occurrence of SCA10 in Indian SCA patients. The at-risk haplotype, 
      CGGC was found to be the most prevalent haplotype across different populations 
      and no segregation of CGGC haplotype with large normal or small normal ATTCT 
      repeats length was observed. However, on extended haplotype analysis, some 
      lineage of CGGC with a flanking divergence at 5' end was observed specifically in 
      the American or East Asian population but not in other population in KGP dataset. 
      Together, these evidence points towards the absence of SCA10 in Indian population 
      and haplotype-based analysis also suggests its occurrence to be rare in South 
      Asian, European and African population. Further investigations are required to 
      establish the present finding. SIGNIFICANCE: The implications of the findings of 
      this study are 1.) For the diagnostic work-up of SCAs in the Indian population 
      and to decide upon inclusion of SCA10 in panel based genetic investigations even 
      for Indians living abroad. 2.) The haplotype based inference of its presumptive 
      prevalence through the estimation of at-risk haplotype using population genetics 
      approach (South-Asians as the background) allowed us to estimate the possible 
      absence of SCA10 in Indian population. SCA10 is a rare autosomal dominant 
      cerebellar ataxia mostly reported among SCA patients from Latin America and 
      recently described in East Asia population. The genetic study of SCA10 performed 
      in the unrelated Indian spinocerebellar ataxia patients with heterogeneous 
      ethnicity confirmed its absence from the Indian population and that conforms to 
      population genetic based inference of its rarity or absence. 3.) This approach 
      may be adopted for the screening of other subtypes of SCAs, i.e. other rare SCAs 
      e.g. SCA31, SCA36, and SCA37.

AB  - A hexanucleotide GGCCTG repeat expansion in intron 1 of the nucleolar protein 56 
      gene causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36), which is a relatively pure 
      cerebellar ataxia with progressive motor neuron involvement. In this study SCA36 
      cell models were generated by introducing expanded GGCCTG/CAGGCC repeats into 
      cultured Neuro2A cells. Sense (GGCCUG)(exp) but not antisense (CAGGCC)(exp) RNA 
      foci were detected in the cells, consistent with observations in autopsied brains 
      of patients with SCA36. Glycine-proline dipeptide repeat (DPR) formation due to 
      repeat-associated non-ATG translation rarely occurred in cells expressing 
      expanded GGCCTG repeats; in contrast, cells harboring expanded c9orf72 
      GGGGCC/GGCCCC repeats robustly expressed DPR proteins. There are currently no 
      effective treatments for microsatellite repeat expansion diseases including 
      SCA36. In order to identify potentially useful therapies, we screened five 
      candidate chemical compounds for their ability to diminish the toxicity of 
      expanded SCA36 repeats and evaluated whether small interfering RNA-mediated 
      silencing of Supt4a/Supt5, the murine ortholog of the yeast transcriptional 
      elongation factor Spt4/Spt5, has therapeutic potential based on RNA foci 
      quantification and cytotoxicity assays. Supt4a knockdown and erythromycin 
      treatment suppressed the formation of (GGCCUG)(exp) RNA foci and DPR protein 
      formation via regulation of (GGCCUG)(exp) mRNA, thereby ameliorating the 
      cytotoxicity in SCA36 cell models. These data provide a basis for developing 
      effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of SCA36 and other repeat 
      expansion disorders.

TI  - Noncoding repeat expansions for ALS in Japan are associated with the ATXN8OS 
      gene.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the contribution of noncoding repeat expansions in Japanese 
      patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). METHODS: Sporadic ALS in 
      Western countries is frequently associated with noncoding repeat expansions in 
      the C9ORF72 gene. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is another noncoding 
      repeat disease caused by expanded CTA/CTG repeats in the ATXN8OS gene. Although 
      the involvement of upper and lower motor neurons in SCA8 has been reported, a 
      positive association between SCA8 and ALS remains unestablished. Spinocerebellar 
      ataxia type 36 is a recently identified disease caused by noncoding repeat 
      expansions in the NOP56 gene and is characterized by motor neuron involvement. We 
      collected blood samples from 102 Japanese patients with sporadic ALS and analyzed 
      the ATXN8OS gene by the PCR-Sanger sequencing method and the C9ORF72 and NOP56 
      genes by repeat-primed PCR assay. RESULTS: Three patients with ALS (3%) had 
      mutations in the ATXN8OS gene, whereas no patient had a mutation in the C9ORF72 
      or NOP56 gene. The mutation-positive patients were clinically characterized by 
      neck weakness or bulbar-predominant symptoms. None of our patients had apparent 
      cerebellar atrophy on MRI, but 2 had nonsymptomatic abnormalities in the white 
      matter or putamen. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding reveals the importance of noncoding 
      repeat expansions in Japanese patients with ALS and extends the clinical 
      phenotype of SCA8. Three percent seems small but is still relatively large for 
      Japan, considering that the most commonly mutated genes, including the SOD1 and 
      SQSTM1 genes, only account for 2%-3% of sporadic patients each.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) subtypes are often caused by expansions 
      in non-coding regions of genes like SCA8, SCA10, SCA12 and SCA36. Other ataxias 
      are known to be associated with repeat expansions such as fragile X-associated 
      tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) or expansions in the C9orf72 gene. When no 
      mutation has been identified in the aforementioned genes next-generation 
      sequencing (NGS)-based diagnostics may also be applied. In order to define an 
      optimal diagnostic strategy, more information about the frequency and phenotypic 
      characteristics of rare repeat expansion disorders associated with ataxia should 
      be at hand. METHODS: We analyzed a consecutive cohort of 440 German unrelated 
      patients with symptoms of cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria and other unspecific 
      symptoms who were referred to our center for SCA diagnostics. They showed alleles 
      in the normal range for the most common SCA subtypes SCA1-3, SCA6, SCA7 and 
      SCA17. These patients were screened for expansions causing SCA8, SCA10, SCA12, 
      SCA36 and FXTAS as well as for the pathogenic hexanucleotide repeat in the 
      C9orf72 gene. RESULTS: Expanded repeats for SCA10, SCA12 or SCA36 were not 
      identified in the analyzed patients. Five patients showed expanded SCA8 CTA/CTG 
      alleles with 92-129 repeats. One 51-year-old male with unclear dementia symptoms 
      was diagnosed with a large GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72. The analysis of 
      the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) revealed one patient with a 
      premutation (>50 CGG repeats) and seven patients with alleles in the grey zone 
      (41 to 54 CGG repeats). CONCLUSIONS: Altogether five patients showed 92 or more 
      SCA8 CTA/CTG combined repeats. Our results support the assumption that smaller 
      FMR1 gene expansions could be associated with the risk of developing neurological 
      signs. The results do not support genetic testing for C9orf72 expansion in ataxia 
      patients.

TI  - Structural and Dynamical Characterization of DNA and RNA Quadruplexes Obtained 
      from the GGGGCC and GGGCCT Hexanucleotide Repeats Associated with C9FTD/ALS and 
      SCA36 Diseases.

AB  - A (GGGGCC) hexanucleotide repeat (HR) expansion in the C9ORF72 gene has been 
      considered the major cause behind both frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis, while a (GGGCCT) is associated with spinocerebellar ataxia 36. 
      Recent experiments involving NMR, CD, optical melting and 1D (1)H NMR 
      spectroscopy, suggest that the r(GGGGCC) HR can adopt a hairpin structure with 
      G-G mismatches in equilibrium with a G-quadruplex structure. G-Quadruplexes have 
      also been identified for d(GGGGCC). As these experiments lack molecular 
      resolution, we have used molecular dynamics microsecond simulations to obtain a 
      structural characterization of the G-quadruplexes associated with both HRs. All 
      DNA G-quadruplexes, parallel or antiparallel, with or without loops are stable, 
      while only parallel and one antiparallel (stabilized by diagonal loops) RNA 
      G-quadruplexes are stable. It is known that antiparallel G-quadruplexes require 
      alternating guanines to be in a syn conformation that is hindered by the C3'-endo 
      pucker preferred by RNA. Initial RNA antiparallel quadruplexes built with 
      C2'-endo sugars evolve such that the transition (C2'-endo)-to-(C3'-endo) triggers 
      unwinding and buckling of the flat G-tetrads, resulting in the unfolding of the 
      RNA antiparallel quadruplex. Finally, a parallel G-quadruplex stabilizes an 
      adjacent C-tetrad in both DNA and RNA (thus effectively becoming a mixed 
      quadruplex of 5 layers). The C-tetrad is stabilized by the stacking interactions 
      with the preceding G-tetrad, by cyclical hydrogen bonds C(N4)-(O2), and by an ion 
      between the G-tetrad and the C-tetrad. In addition, antiparallel DNA 
      G-quadruplexes also stabilize flat C-layers at the ends of the quadruplexes.

TI  - Antisense Oligonucleotides Reduce RNA Foci in Spinocerebellar Ataxia 36 Patient 
      iPSCs.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 is a late-onset, slowly progressive cerebellar 
      syndrome with motor neuron degeneration that is caused by expansions of a 
      hexanucleotide repeat (GGCCTG) in the noncoding region of NOP56 gene, with a 
      histopathological feature of RNA foci formation in postmortem tissues. Here, we 
      report a cellular model using the spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 patient induced 
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We generated iPSCs from spinocerebellar ataxia 
      type 36 patients and differentiated them into neurons. The number of 
      RNA-foci-positive cells was increased in patient iPSCs and iPSC-derived neurons. 
      Treatment of the 2'-O, 4'-C-ethylene-bridged nucleic acid antisense 
      oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting NOP56 pre-mRNA reduced RNA-foci-positive cells 
      to  approximately 50% in patient iPSCs and iPSC-derived neurons. NOP56 mRNA expression levels 
      were lower in patient iPSCs and iPSC-derived neurons than in healthy control 
      neurons. One of the ASOs reduced the number of RNA-foci-positive cells without 
      altering NOP56 mRNA expression levels in patient iPSCs and iPSC-derived neurons. 
      These data show that iPSCs from spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 patients can be 
      useful for evaluating the effects of ASOs toward GGCCTG repeat expansion in 
      spinocerebellar ataxia type 36.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and clinical features of individuals affected 
      by spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36) at a large tertiary referral center in the 
      United States. METHODS: A total of 577 patients with undiagnosed sporadic or 
      familial cerebellar ataxia comprehensively evaluated at a tertiary referral 
      ataxia center were molecularly evaluated for SCA36. Repeat primed PCR and 
      fragment analysis were used to screen for the presence of a repeat expansion in 
      the NOP56 gene. RESULTS: Fragment analysis of triplet repeat primed PCR products 
      identified a GGCCTG hexanucleotide repeat expansion in intron 1 of NOP56 in 4 
      index cases. These 4 SCA36-positive families comprised 2 distinct ethnic groups: 
      white (European) (2) and Asian (Japanese [1] and Vietnamese [1]). Individuals 
      affected by SCA36 exhibited typical clinical features with gait ataxia and age at 
      onset ranging between 35 and 50 years. Patients also suffered from ataxic or 
      spastic limbs, altered reflexes, abnormal ocular movement, and cognitive 
      impairment. CONCLUSIONS: In a US population, SCA36 was observed to be a rare 
      disorder, accounting for 0.7% (4/577 index cases) of disease in a large 
      undiagnosed ataxia cohort.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the genetic and clinical characteristics of the GGCCTG 
      hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the nucleolar protein 56 gene (NOP56) in 
      patients with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), sporadic ataxia, or amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Taiwan. METHODS: We conducted clinical and molecular 
      genetic studies of 109 probands with molecularly unassigned SCA from 512 SCA 
      pedigrees, 323 healthy controls, 502 patients with sporadic ataxia syndromes, and 
      144 patients with ALS. Repeat-primed PCR assays and PCR-fragment analysis for the 
      number of short hexanucleotide repeats (<40 units) were performed to ascertain 
      NOP56 hexanucleotide repeat expansion. Genotyping included 8 microsatellite 
      markers and 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms flanking NOP56 and covering a 
      region of 1.8 Mb to assess a possible founder effect. RESULTS: Eleven individuals 
      from 3 SCA pedigrees have the NOP56 repeat expansions. The 3 pedigrees share a 
      common haplotype spanning 5.3 kb flanking the NOP56 repeat expansions, suggesting 
      a founder effect of spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36) in the Han Chinese. 
      The average age at symptom onset was 44.8 +/- 3.8 years with truncal ataxia as the 
      initial manifestation. Common features included slowly progressive truncal/limb 
      ataxia, dysarthria, generalized hyperreflexia, and hearing impairment. Evidence 
      of lower motor neuron involvement, including atrophy and fasciculation in the 
      limb muscles and tongue, was mostly found in patients with prolonged disease 
      duration. NOP56 repeat expansion was not detected in controls or patients with 
      sporadic ataxic syndromes or ALS. CONCLUSIONS: SCA36 is an uncommon subtype, 
      which accounted for 0.6% (3/512) of SCA cases in the Han Chinese population.

TI  - Genetic and clinical analysis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 in Mainland 
      China.

LID - 10.1111/cge.12706 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36) is a new SCA subtype recently reported in 
      Japanese and Spanish pedigrees. To assess the frequency and clinical 
      characteristics of SCA36 in patients from Mainland China, we combined the 
      repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction method and Southern blot analysis to 
      detect the GGCCTG hexanucleotide repeats of NOP56 in 364 probands with SCA, 126 
      probands with hereditary spastic paraplegia and 99 probands with amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis (ALS). Systematic and targeted clinical evaluations and 
      investigations were conducted in the SCA36 patients. As a result, eight autosomal 
      dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (ADCA) pedigrees (a total of 13 patients) and one 
      sporadic SCA (S-SCA) patient were identified as SCA36 in the SCA cohort, 
      accounting for approximately 1.60% of the cases in the ADCA group and 0.32% of 
      those in the S-SCA group in Mainland China. The characteristics include late 
      onset and slow progression accompanied by acoustic impairments and 'possible' ALS 
      phenotype in patients from Mainland China.

TI  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 exists in diverse populations and can be caused by 
      a short hexanucleotide GGCCTG repeat expansion.
PG  - 986-95
LID - 10.1136/jnnp-2014-309153 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Spinocerebellar ataxia 36 (SCA36) is an autosomal-dominant 
      neurodegenerative disorder caused by a large (>650) hexanucleotide GGCCTG repeat 
      expansion in the first intron of the NOP56 gene. The aim of this study is to 
      clarify the prevalence, clinical and genetic features of SCA36. METHODS: The 
      expansion was tested in 676 unrelated SCA index cases and 727 controls from 
      France, Germany and Japan. Clinical and neuropathological features were 
      investigated in available family members. RESULTS: Normal alleles ranged between 
      5 and 14 hexanucleotide repeats. Expansions were detected in 12 families in 
      France (prevalence: 1.9% of all French SCAs) including one family each with 
      Spanish, Portuguese or Chinese ancestry, in five families in Japan (1.5% of all 
      Japanese SCAs), but were absent in German patients. All the 17 SCA36 families 
      shared one common haplotype for a 7.5 kb pairs region flanking the expansion. 
      While 27 individuals had typically long expansions, three affected individuals 
      harboured small hexanucleotide expansions of 25, 30 and 31 hexanucleotide 
      repeat-units, demonstrating that such a small expansion could cause the disease. 
      All patients showed slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia frequently accompanied 
      by hearing and cognitive impairments, tremor, ptosis and reduced vibration sense, 
      with the age at onset ranging between 39 and 65 years, and clinical features were 
      indistinguishable between individuals with short and typically long expansions. 
      Neuropathology in a presymptomatic case disclosed that Purkinje cells and 
      hypoglossal neurons are affected. CONCLUSIONS: SCA36 is rare with a worldwide 
      distribution. It can be caused by a short GGCCTG expansion and associates various 
      extracerebellar symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 (SCA36), also called 
      Asidan, is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder identified as a 
      hexanucleotide GGCCTG repeat expansion in the first intron 1 of the NOP56 gene. 
      In the present study, for the first time an autopsy sample from an Asidan patient 
      was examined and cytoplasmic inclusions and (GGCCUG)n repeat RNA foci were 
      detected. METHODS: Hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemical staining, 
      as well as fluorescence in situ hybridization were used to investigate the 
      cytoplasmic inclusions of ubiquitin and p62 and the (GGCCUG)n repeat RNA foci. 
      RESULTS: The present study showed both ubiquitin- and p62-positive inclusions in 
      the cytoplasm of the inferior olivary nucleus of the Asidan patient, (GGCCUG)n 
      RNA foci in neuronal nuclei of the cerebrum, cerebellum, inferior olive, spinal 
      cord and temporal muscle, and three types of RNA foci, i.e. single small, 
      multiple small and giant. Of interest is that the giant RNA foci, nearly 10 mum in 
      diameter, that were detected in Purkinje cells, spinal motor neurons and most 
      frequently in the inferior olivary nucleus, may be responsible for pivotal 
      clinical symptoms of Asidan. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is the first report 
      to show neuronal cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and giant RNA foci in an Asidan 
      patient. The relationships between the giant RNA foci and neurodegeneration have 
      yet to be studied.

AB  - Intermediate-length polyglutamine expansions in ataxin 2 are a risk factor for 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The polyglutamine tract is encoded by a 
      trinucleotide repeat in a coding region of the ataxin 2 gene (ATXN2). Noncoding 
      nucleotide repeat expansions in several genes are also associated with 
      neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. For example, hexanucleotide repeat 
      expansions located in a noncoding region of C9ORF72 are the most common cause of 
      ALS. We sought to assess a potential larger role of noncoding nucleotide repeat 
      expansions in ALS. We analyzed the nucleotide repeat lengths of 6 genes (ATXN8, 
      ATXN10, PPP2R2B, NOP56, DMPK, and JPH3) that have previously been associated with 
      neurologic or neuromuscular disorders, in several hundred sporadic patients with 
      ALS and healthy control subjects. We report no association between ALS and repeat 
      length in any of these genes, suggesting that variation in the noncoding 
      repetitive regions in these genes does not contribute to ALS.

TI  - Clinical features of SCA36: a novel spinocerebellar ataxia with motor neuron 
      involvement (Asidan).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the phenotype of spinocerebellar ataxia type 36 
      (SCA36), a novel dominant disorder (nicknamed "Asidan") caused by a 
      hexanucleotide GGCCTG repeat expansion in intron 1 of the NOP56 gene. METHODS: We 
      investigated the clinical, genetic, and neuropathologic characteristics of 18 
      patients with SCA36. We performed histologic evaluation of a muscle biopsy 
      specimen from 1 patient with SCA36, and neuropathologic evaluation of an 
      autopsied brain from another patient with SCA36. RESULTS: The (GGCCTG)n expansion 
      was found in 18 ataxic patients from 9 families. The age at onset of ataxia was 
      53.1 +/- 3.4 years, with the most frequent symptoms being truncal ataxia (100% of 
      patients), ataxic dysarthria (100%), limb ataxia (93%), and hyperreflexia (79%). 
      Tongue fasciculation and subsequent atrophy were found in 71% of cases, 
      particularly in those of long duration. Skeletal muscle fasciculation and atrophy 
      of the limbs and trunk were found in 57% of cases. Lower motor involvement was 
      confirmed by EMG and muscle biopsy. The neuropathologic study revealed 
      significant cerebellar Purkinje cell degeneration with obvious loss of lower 
      motor neurons. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that NOP56 was localized to 
      the nuclei of various neurons. Cytoplasmic or intranuclear inclusion staining of 
      NOP56, TDP-43, and ataxin-2 was not observed in the remaining neurons. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This is the first description of the unique clinical features of 
      SCA36, a relatively pure cerebellar ataxia with progressive motor neuron 
      involvement. Thus, SCA36 is a disease that stands at the crossroads of SCA and 
      motor neuron disease.

TI  - 'Costa da Morte' ataxia is spinocerebellar ataxia 36: clinical and genetic 
      characterization.
PG  - 1423-35
LID - 10.1093/brain/aws069 [doi]
AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia 36 has been recently described in Japanese families as a 
      new type of spinocerebellar ataxia with motor neuron signs. It is caused by a 
      GGCCTG repeat expansion in intron 1 of NOP56. Family interview and document 
      research allowed us to reconstruct two extensive, multigenerational kindreds 
      stemming from the same village (Costa da Morte in Galicia, Spain), in the 17th 
      century. We found the presence of the spinocerebellar ataxia 36 mutation 
      co-segregating with disease in these families in whom we had previously 
      identified an ~0.8 Mb linkage region to chromosome 20 p. Subsequent screening 
      revealed the NOP56 expansion in eight additional Galician ataxia kindreds. While 
      normal alleles contain 5-14 hexanucleotide repeats, expanded alleles range from 
      ~650 to 2500 repeats, within a shared haplotype. Further expansion of repeat size 
      was frequent, especially upon paternal transmission, while instances of allele 
      contraction were observed in maternal transmissions. We found a total of 63 
      individuals carrying the mutation, 44 of whom were confirmed to be clinically 
      affected; over 400 people are at risk. We describe here the detailed clinical 
      picture, consisting of a late-onset, slowly progressive cerebellar syndrome with 
      variable eye movement abnormalities and sensorineural hearing loss. There were 
      signs of denervation in the tongue, as well as mild pyramidal signs, but 
      otherwise no signs of classical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Magnetic resonance 
      imaging findings were consistent with the clinical course, showing atrophy of the 
      cerebellar vermis in initial stages, later evolving to a pattern of 
      olivo-ponto-cerebellar atrophy. We estimated the origin of the founder mutation 
      in Galicia to have occurred ~1275 years ago. Out of 160 Galician families with 
      spinocerebellar ataxia, 10 (6.3%) were found to have spinocerebellar ataxia 36, 
      while 15 (9.4%) showed other of the routinely tested dominant spinocerebellar 
      ataxia types. Spinocerebellar ataxia 36 is thus, so far, the most frequent 
      dominant spinocerebellar ataxia in this region, which may have implications for 
      American countries associated with traditional Spanish emigration.

TI  - Expansion of intronic GGCCTG hexanucleotide repeat in NOP56 causes SCA36, a type 
      of spinocerebellar ataxia accompanied by motor neuron involvement.
PG  - 121-30
LID - 10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.05.015 [doi]
AB  - Autosomal-dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a heterogeneous group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we performed genetic analysis of a 
      unique form of SCA (SCA36) that is accompanied by motor neuron involvement. 
      Genome-wide linkage analysis and subsequent fine mapping for three unrelated 
      Japanese families in a cohort of SCA cases, in whom molecular diagnosis had never 
      been performed, mapped the disease locus to the region of a 1.8 Mb stretch (LOD 
      score of 4.60) on 20p13 (D20S906-D20S193) harboring 37 genes with definitive open 
      reading frames. We sequenced 33 of these and observed a large expansion of an 
      intronic GGCCTG hexanucleotide repeat in NOP56 and an unregistered missense 
      variant (Phe265Leu) in C20orf194, but we found no mutations in PDYN and TGM6. The 
      expansion showed complete segregation with the SCA phenotype in family studies, 
      whereas Phe265Leu in C20orf194 did not. Screening of the expansions in the SCA 
      cohort cases revealed four additional occurrences, but none were revealed in the 
      cohort of 27 Alzheimer disease cases, 154 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases, or 
      300 controls. In total, nine unrelated cases were found in 251 cohort SCA 
      patients (3.6%). A founder haplotype was confirmed in these cases. RNA foci 
      formation was detected in lymphoblastoid cells from affected subjects by 
      fluorescence in situ hybridization. Double staining and gel-shift assay showed 
      that (GGCCUG)n binds the RNA-binding protein SRSF2 but that (CUG)(6) does not. In 
      addition, transcription of MIR1292, a neighboring miRNA, was significantly 
      decreased in lymphoblastoid cells of SCA patients. Our finding suggests that 
      SCA36 is caused by hexanucleotide repeat expansions through RNA gain of function.
