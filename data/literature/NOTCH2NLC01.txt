AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare neurodegenerative 
      disordercharacterized by eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions in the 
      nervous system. NIID is associated with GGC repeat expansions in the 5' 
      untranslatedregion of the NOTCH2NLC gene. The induced pluripotent stem cells 
      (iPSC), generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a 75-year-old male 
      patient with NIID, exhibited stem cell marker expression, normal karyotype, 
      absence of viral factors, successful differentiation into the three germ layers, 
      and were analyzed for GGC repeat expansion. These patient-derived iPSCs have 
      promising potential for exploring the genetic mechanisms underlying NIID.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is a rare hereditary muscle 
      disease characterized by progressive ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, dysphagia, 
      dysarthria, and distal muscle weakness. The genetic basis was identified in 2019 
      with CGG repeat expansions in the noncoding region of LRP12. Similar expansions 
      in GIPC1, NOTCH2NLC, and RILPL1 were later linked to OPDM, classifying the 
      disease into OPDM1-4. OPDM4, associated with RILPL1, was discovered in 2022 with 
      a few confirmed cases worldwide, leaving its clinical features and pathogenic 
      mechanisms largely unexplored. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a patient with OPDM4 
      who had suffered progressive ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, pharyngeal 
      weakness, facial muscle weakness, and distal limb weakness over the past 
      20 years. Electromyography (EMG) revealed myogenic damage and normal H-reflex 
      latency. A biopsy of the left biceps brachii revealed myogenic changes with 
      atypical rimmed vacuoles in some muscle fibers. Screening for extra-muscular 
      system involvement revealed no obvious involvement of the heart or central 
      nervous system. Genetic analysis confirmed 126 CGG repeat expansions in RILPL1 
      and excluded abnormal CGG repeat expansions in LRP12, GIPC1, and NOTCH2NLC. 
      CONCLUSION: This case broadens the spectrum of CGG repeat numbers in the RILPL1 
      gene associated with OPDM4. In addition, systematic medical examinations revealed 
      several new characteristics of OPDM4, which have not been reported previously, 
      such as normal H reflex, potential mild cognitive impairment, etc. These findings 
      expand our knowledge of the phenotypic spectrum of diseases caused by repeat CGG 
      expansions in RILPL1.

AB  - The CGG repeat expansions in the 5'-UTR regions of certain genes have been 
      implicated in various neurodegenerative and muscular disorders. However, the 
      underlying pathogenic mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we 
      explore the role of the small molecular chaperone HSPB1 in counteracting 
      neurodegeneration induced by poly-glycine (poly-G) aggregates. Employing a 
      reporter system, we demonstrate that CGG repeat expansions within the 5'-UTR of 
      the GIPC1 gene produce poly-G proteins, by repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) 
      translation. Through proximity labeling and subsequent mass spectrometry 
      analysis, we characterize the composition of poly-G insoluble aggregates and 
      reveal that these aggregates sequester key macroautophagy/autophagy receptors, 
      SQSTM1/p62 and TOLLIP. This sequestration disrupts MAP1LC3/LC3 recruitment and 
      impairs autophagosome formation, thereby compromising the autophagic pathway. 
      Importantly, we show that HSPB1 facilitates the dissociation of these receptors 
      from poly-G aggregates and consequently restores autophagic function. 
      Overexpressing HSPB1 alleviates poly-G-induced neurodegeneration in mouse models. 
      Taken together, these findings highlight a mechanistic basis for the 
      neuroprotective effects of HSPB1 and suggest its potential as a therapeutic 
      target in treating poly-G-associated neurodegenerative diseases.Abbreviations:

TI  - uN2CpolyG-mediated p65 nuclear sequestration suppresses the NF-kappaB-NLRP3 pathway 
      in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease.
PG  - 68
LID - 10.1186/s12964-025-02079-1 [doi]
LID - 68
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is genetically linked 
      to CGG repeat expansion in the 5'-untranslated region of the NOTCH2NLC gene, with 
      nascent polyglycine-containing protein (uN2CpolyG) identified as a primary 
      pathogenic factor. Emerging clinical evidence suggests that inflammation 
      contributes to NIID pathogenesis, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain 
      elusive. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular interaction between 
      uN2CpolyG and the NF-kappaB-NLRP3 pathway. METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing was 
      conducted on the skin tissues of NIID patients to assess changes in the 
      expression of genes involved in inflammatory pathways. Cell models (HEK-293T and 
      U87-MG) transfected with CGG(9/69/100) expansion vectors were used to investigate 
      alterations in the NF-kappaB-NLRP3-autophagy pathway. Additionally, the therapeutic 
      potential of NF-kappaB activators was evaluated in a Drosophila model with a CGG 
      expansion knock-in. RESULTS: Single-cell sequencing revealed a significant 
      reduction in the expression of NFKBIA, encoding NF-kappaB inhibitor alpha (IkBa), 
      which facilitates the nuclear translocation of p65, a key NF-kappaB component. 
      uN2CpolyG directly interacted with and sequestered p65 in nuclear inclusions, 
      leading to reduced phosphorylated p65 (p-p65) levels. This sequestration 
      significantly downregulated the NF-kappaB-NLRP3 pathway, impairing autophagy, as 
      indicated by decreased LC3II/LC3I ratios. Treatment of CGG(100) cells with 
      lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly increased p-p65, NLRP3, and LC3II/LC3I 
      levels while reducing insoluble uN2CpolyG levels and intranuclear inclusions. In 
      the Drosophila knock-in model, LPS significantly reduced the number of 
      intranuclear inclusions and improved phenotypic manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study revealed that uN2CpolyG directly interacts with and sequesters p65, thereby 
      inhibiting the NF-kappaB-NLRP3 pathway and impairing autophagy. This mechanism 
      highlights a novel therapeutic target for NIID and provides potentially broader 
      insights into similar mechanisms in other neurodegenerative diseases 
      characterized by misfolded protein aggregates.

TI  - NOTCH2NLC GGC intermediate repeat with serine induces hypermyelination and early 
      Parkinson's disease-like phenotypes in mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The expansion of GGC repeats (typically exceeding 60 repeats) in the 
      5' untranslated region (UTR) of the NOTCH2NLC gene (N2C) is linked to N2C-related 
      repeat expansion disorders (NREDs), such as neuronal intranuclear inclusion 
      disease (NIID), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), essential tremor (ET), and 
      Parkinson's disease (PD). These disorders share common clinical manifestations, 
      including parkinsonism, dementia, seizures, and muscle weakness. Intermediate 
      repeat sizes ranging from 40 to 60 GGC repeats, particularly those with 
      AGC-encoded serine insertions, have been reported to be associated with PD; 
      however, the functional implications of these intermediate repeats with serine 
      insertion remain unexplored. METHODS: Here, we utilized cellular models 
      harbouring different sizes of N2C variant 2 (N2C2) GGC repeat expansion and 
      CRISPR-Cas9 engineered transgenic mouse models carrying N2C2 GGC intermediate 
      repeats with and without serine insertion to elucidate the underlying 
      pathophysiology associated with N2C intermediate repeat with serine insertion in 
      NREDs. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that the N2C2 GGC intermediate repeat with 
      serine insertion (32G13S) led to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in 
      vitro. The neurotoxicity was influenced by the length of the repeat and was 
      exacerbated by the presence of the serine insertion. In 12-month-old transgenic 
      mice, 32G13S intensified intranuclear aggregation and exhibited early PD-like 
      characteristics, including the formation of alpha-synuclein fibers in the midbrain 
      and the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in both the cortex and 
      striatum. Additionally, 32G13S induced neuronal hyperexcitability and caused 
      locomotor behavioural impairments. Transcriptomic analysis of the mouse cortex 
      indicated dysregulation in calcium signaling and MAPK signaling pathways, both of 
      which are critical for mitochondrial function. Notably, genes associated with 
      myelin sheath components, including MBP and MOG, were dysregulated in the 32G13S 
      mouse. Further investigations using immunostaining and transmission electron 
      microscopy revealed that the N2C intermediate repeat with serine induced 
      mitochondrial dysfunction-related hypermyelination in the cortex. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our in vitro and in vivo investigations provide the first evidence that the 
      N2C-GGC intermediate repeat with serine promotes intranuclear aggregation of N2C, 
      leading to mitochondrial dysfunction-associated hypermyelination and neuronal 
      hyperexcitability. These changes contribute to motor deficits in early PD-like 
      neurodegeneration in NREDs.

TI  - Neuronal Intranuclear Inclusion Disease Presenting with Acute-Onset Dementia and 
      Cortical Edema: A Case Report.
PG  - 1464991
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2024.1464991 [doi]
LID - 1464991
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuronal Intranuclear Inclusion Disease (NIID) is a neurodegenerative 
      disorder characterized by the formation of eosinophilic inclusions in the 
      neurons, visceral and skin cells. The cause is associated with the GGC nucleotide 
      repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene. The imaging hallmark of NIID is 
      hyperintensities on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at the corticomedullary 
      junction. Clinical manifestations of NIID are highly heterogeneous. Here, we 
      report a case of NIID presenting with acute-onset dementia and cortical edema. 
      CASE PRESENTATION: We describe an elderly male patient who presented with sudden 
      dementia within a day. Considering the abrupt onset and the stroke history, we 
      initially diagnosed vascular disease. However, further imaging revealed cortical 
      edema in the temporo-parieto-occipital lobes. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid tests 
      ruled out immunological, metabolic, infectious, or neoplastic etiologies. Genetic 
      testing ultimately confirmed the diagnosis of NIID. Intravenous immunoglobulin 
      (IVIG) therapy did not improve the patient's symptoms; However, about 1 month 
      after treatment, spontaneous improvement was observed. It is noteworthy that 
      22 months before the onset of cognitive impairment, the patient's MRI for 
      headaches already exhibited the typical imaging lesions of this disease in the 
      cerebellum paravermal region. CONCLUSION: Patients with encephalopathy syndrome 
      exhibiting imaging features resembling mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic 
      acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease 
      should consider the NIID as differential diagnosis. Chronic headaches and 
      symmetric lesions in the cerebellar paravermal region on MRI may be noteworthy 
      indicators of NIID during non-episodic phases.

TI  - CGG Repeat Expansion in NOTCH2NLC Causing Overlapping Oculopharyngodistal 
      Myopathy and Neuronal Intranuclear Inclusion Disease With Diffusion Weighted 
      Imaging Abnormality in the Cerebellum.
PG  - 580-590
LID - 10.3988/jcn.2023.0486 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CGG repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region 
      (5'UTR) of the Notch 2 N-terminal-like C gene (NOTCH2NLC) has been associated 
      with neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) and oculopharyngodistal 
      myopathy type 3 (OPDM3). Few OPDM3 patients have been reported. This report 
      describes two OPDM3 patients with novel imaging findings who presented the 
      typical features of NIID, and reviews all OPDM3 cases available in the 
      literature. METHODS: The available clinical, imaging, and pathological 
      information was reviewed and investigated. CGG repeat expansion in the 5'UTR of 
      NOTCH2NLC was tested using the repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 
      followed by the fluorescence amplicon-length PCR to determine the number of CGG 
      repeats. RESULTS: Our two OPDM3 patients and most patients reported in the 
      literature developed the typical clinical characteristics of NIID, including 
      leukoencephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, cognitive deterioration, pigmentary 
      retinopathy, ataxia, tremor, acute encephalitis-like episodes, pigmentary 
      retinopathy, miosis, and sensorineural hearing loss. In addition to typical 
      imaging findings of NIID, our two patients exhibited diffusion weighted imaging 
      (DWI) hyperintensities in the middle cerebellar peduncles, which have not been 
      described previously. Muscle biopsies revealed rimmed vacuoles and p62-positive 
      intranuclear inclusions in the myofibers in both patients. The skin biopsy 
      performed in one patient detected typical eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions. 
      Genetic analysis identified CGG repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC as the causative 
      mutation in the two patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our two patients with OPDM3 had 
      clinical characteristics of NIID and exhibited DWI abnormality in the cerebellum. 
      Our results indicate that OPDM3 is within the spectrum of NIID and that DWI 
      hyperintensities in the cerebellum are helpful for diagnosing NIID or OPDM3.

TI  - dmTGS: Precise Targeted Enrichment Long-Read Sequencing Panel for Tandem Repeat 
      Detection.
PG  - 319-331
LID - 10.1093/clinchem/hvae164 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tandem repeats (TRs) are abundant in the human genome and associated 
      with repeat expansion disorders. Our study aimed to develop a tandem repeat panel 
      utilizing targeted long-read sequencing to evaluate known TRs associated with 
      these disorders and assess its clinical utility. METHODS: We developed a targeted 
      long-read sequencing panel for 70 TR loci, termed dynamic mutation 
      third-generation sequencing (dmTGS), using the PacBio Sequel II platform. We 
      tested 108 samples with suspected repeat expansion disorders and compared the 
      results with conventional molecular methods. RESULTS: For 108 samples, dmTGS 
      achieved an average of 8000 high-fidelity reads per sample, with a mean read 
      length of 4.7 kb and read quality of 99.9%. dmTGS outperformed repeat-primed-PCR 
      and fluorescence amplicon length analysis-PCR in distinguishing expanded from 
      normal alleles and accurately quantifying repeat counts. The method demonstrated 
      high concordance with confirmatory methods (rlinear = 0.991, P < 0.01), and 
      detected mosaicism with sensitivities of 1% for FMR1 CGG premutation and 5% for 
      full mutations. dmTGS successfully identified interruptive motifs in genes that 
      conventional methods had missed. For variable number TRs in the PLIN4 gene, dmTGS 
      identified precise repeat counts and sequence motifs. Screening 57 patients with 
      suspected genetic muscular diseases, dmTGS confirmed repeat expansions in genes 
      such as GIPC1, NOTCH2NLC, NUTM2B-AS1/LOC642361, and DMPK. Additionally, dmTGS 
      detected CCG interruptions in CTG repeats in 8 myotonic dystrophy type 1 patients 
      with detailed characterization. CONCLUSIONS: dmTGS accurately detects repeat 
      sizes and interruption motifs associated with repeat expansion disorders and 
      demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional molecular methods.

AB  - A heterozygous CGG repeat expansion in 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of GIPC1 
      is one of the causative factors of oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM), an 
      adult-onset hereditary muscle disease characterized by progressive ptosis, 
      ophthalmoplegia, and facial, bulbar, and distal limb muscle weakness. CGG repeat 
      expansion in GIPC1 has also been reported to be associated with Parkinson's 
      disease, but these patients did not exhibit myopathic symptoms. We experienced 
      two unrelated cases of oculopharyngeal type myopathy with CGG repeat expansion in 
      GIPC1 presenting parkinsonism after exhibiting myopathic symptoms. Both cases 
      showed p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in the skin, similar to those in 
      NOTCH2NLC-related disorders. Our cases suggest that GIPC1-related repeat 
      expansions may be associated with a broad spectrum and tissue-differential 
      neuromuscular manifestations, indicating a common mechanism between OPDM2 and 
      other CGG-repeat expansion diseases. It is important to note OPDM2 patients' 
      central neurological symptoms, as myopathic symptoms may obscure central nervous 
      system manifestations.

TI  - GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC cause uN2CpolyG cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
PG  - 467-479
LID - 10.1093/brain/awae274 [doi]
AB  - The expansion of GGC repeats within NOTCH2NLC leads to translation of the 
      uN2CpolyG protein, the primary pathogenic factor in neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusion disease (NIID). The aim of this study was to explore the deposition of 
      uN2CpolyG as an amyloid in the vessel wall, leading to uN2CpolyG cerebral amyloid 
      angiopathy-related cerebral microbleeds (CMBs). A total of 97 patients with 
      genetically confirmed NIID were enrolled in this study. We analysed the presence 
      of CMBs using susceptibility-weighted imaging sequences and compared general 
      clinical information, cerebrovascular risk factors, stroke history, antiplatelet 
      medication use and MRI features between NIID patients with and without CMBs. We 
      also performed haematoxylin and eosin, Perl's, Congo red and Thioflavin S 
      staining, ubiquitin, p62 and uN2CpolyG immunostaining on brain tissue obtained 
      from four NIID patients. A total of 354 CMBs were detected among 41 patients with 
      NIID, with nearly half located in the deep brain, one-third in the lobes and  approximately 20% 
      in the infratentorial area. No significant differences in cerebrovascular disease 
      risk factors or history of antiplatelet drug use were observed between patients 
      with and without CMBs. However, patients with CMBs had suffered a higher 
      incidence of previous ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke events. This group also 
      had a higher incidence of recent subcortical infarcts and a higher proportion of 
      white matter lesions in the external capsule and temporal pole. Conversely, 
      patients without CMBs showed higher detection of high signals at the 
      corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted imaging and more pronounced brain 
      atrophy. Haematoxylin and eosin staining showed blood vessel leakage and 
      haemosiderin-laden macrophage clusters, and Prussian blue staining revealed iron 
      deposition in brain tissue. CMBs occurred more frequently in small vessels 
      lacking intranuclear inclusions, and extensive degeneration of endothelial cells 
      and smooth muscle fibres was observed mainly in vessels lacking inclusions. Congo 
      red-positive amyloid deposition was observed in the cerebral vessels of NIID 
      patients, with disordered filamentous fibres appearing under an electron 
      microscope. Additionally, the co-localization of Thioflavin S-labelled amyloid 
      and uN2CpolyG protein in the cerebral vascular walls of NIID patients further 
      suggested that uN2CpolyG is the main pathogenic protein in this form of amyloid 
      angiopathy. In conclusion, we reviewed patients with GGC repeat expansion of 
      NOTCH2NLC from a new perspective, providing initial clinical, neuroimaging and 
      pathological evidence suggesting that uN2CpolyG might contribute to a distinct 
      type of cerebral amyloid angiopathy.

TI  - A family with neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease with focal segmental 
      glomerulosclerosis.
PG  - 6227-6237
LID - 10.1007/s00415-024-12593-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare 
      neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion of GGC repeats in the 
      5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of NOTCH2NLC. Although increasing evidence 
      suggests that NIID affects various organs, its association with renal involvement 
      remains unclear. We studied the genetic background of a family with NIID, in 
      which four of five members presented with proteinuria as the initial 
      manifestation. The renal pathology of three patients was diagnosed as focal 
      segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) at a previous hospital. These patients also 
      presented with tremors, retinal degeneration, and episodic neurological events. 
      Finally, one patient exhibited reversible bilateral thalamic high-intensity 
      signal changes on diffusion-weighted imaging during episodic neurological events. 
      METHODS: Exome sequencing (ES) and nanopore long-read whole-genome sequencing 
      (LR-WGS) were performed on the index case, followed by nanopore target sequencing 
      using Cas9-mediated PCR-free enrichment and methylation analysis. RESULTS: ES 
      revealed no candidate variants; however, nanopore LR-WGS in the index case 
      revealed expansion of short tandem repeats (STR) in NOTCH2NLC. Subsequent 
      nanopore target sequencing using Cas9-mediated PCR-free enrichment showed STR 
      expansion of NOTCH2NLC in an affected sibling and asymptomatic father. 
      Methylation analysis using nanopore data revealed hypermethylation of the 
      expanded allele in the asymptomatic father and partial hypermethylation in a 
      mildly symptomatic sibling, whereas the expanded allele was hypomethylated in the 
      index case. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation expands the clinical spectrum of 
      NIID, suggesting that STR expansion of NOTCH2NLC is a cause of renal diseases, 
      including FSGS.

TI  - Prevalence and Characterization of NOTCH2NLC GGC Repeat Expansions in Koreans: 
      From a Hospital Cohort Analysis to a Population-Wide Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: GGC repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene are 
      associated with a broad spectrum of progressive neurologic disorders, notably, 
      neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). We aimed to investigate the 
      population-wide prevalence and clinical manifestations of NOTCH2NLC-related 
      disorders in Koreans. METHODS: We conducted a study using 2 different cohorts 
      from the Korean population. Patients with available brain MRI scans from Seoul 
      National University Hospital (SNUH) were thoroughly reviewed, and NIID-suspected 
      patients presenting the zigzag edging signs underwent genetic evaluation for 
      NOTCH2NLC repeats by Cas9-mediated nanopore sequencing. In addition, we analyzed 
      whole-genome sequencing data from 3,887 individuals in the Korea Biobank cohort 
      to estimate the distribution of the repeat counts in Koreans and to identify 
      putative patients with expanded alleles and neurologic phenotypes. RESULTS: In 
      the SNUH cohort, among 90 adult-onset leukoencephalopathy patients with unknown 
      etiologies, we found 20 patients with zigzag edging signs. Except for 2 diagnosed 
      with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome and 2 with unavailable samples, 
      all 16 patients (17.8%) were diagnosed with NIID (repeat range: 87-217). By 
      analyzing the Korea Biobank cohort, we estimated the distribution of repeat 
      counts and threshold (>64) for Koreans, identifying 6 potential patients with 
      NIID. Furthermore, long-read sequencing enabled the elucidation of transmission 
      and epigenetic patterns of NOTCH2NLC repeats within a family affected by 
      pediatric-onset NIID. DISCUSSION: This study presents the population-wide 
      distribution of NOTCH2NLC repeats and the estimated prevalence of NIID in 
      Koreans, providing valuable insights into the association between repeat counts 
      and disease manifestations in diverse neurologic disorders.

AB  - The unclear pathogenic mechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders stemming from 
      NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions drive focused research. Thus, a bibliometric and 
      meta-analysis was conducted to uncover research trends and positivity rates in 
      NOTCH2NLC. We conducted systematic searches in the Web of Science, PubMed, 
      Embase, and Scopus databases for studies related to NOTCH2NLC up until August 2, 
      2023. Information regarding countries, institutions, authors, journals, and 
      keywords of studies included in the Web of Science was analyzed and visualized. 
      The positivity rates of NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions across all screened 
      patients and patients' families were pooled under the random-effects model. 
      Publication bias and its impact were examined using funnel plots, Egger's linear 
      regression, and trim-and-fill method. The bibliometric analysis, revealing 
      pronounced publication growth, comprised 119 studies, which came from China and 
      Japan particularly. "Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease" emerged as a 
      frequently used keyword. The meta-analysis comprised 36 studies, indicating 
      global positivity rates of 1.79% (95% CI, 0.75-3.17) for all patients and 2.00% 
      (95% CI, 0.26-4.78) for patients' families. Subgroup analyses based on region and 
      phenotype suggested the highest NOTCH2NLC positivity rates in Taiwan population 
      (5.42%, 95% CI 0.08-16.89) and in leukoencephalopathy-dominant patients (8.25%, 
      95% CI, 3.01-15.60). Sensitivity analysis affirmed the robustness of results. In 
      conclusion, NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions exhibit rare globally, primarily in 
      East Asia, and leukoencephalopathy-dominant patients, emphasizing regional and 
      phenotypic distinctions. Emerging focal points in NOTCH2NLC researches underscore 
      the need for collaborative exploration.

TI  - Investigating Repeat Expansions in NIPA1, NOP56, and NOTCH2NLC Genes: A Closer 
      Look at Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Patients from Southern Italy.
LID - 10.3390/cells13080677 [doi]
LID - 677
AB  - The discovery of hexanucleotide repeats expansion (RE) in Chromosome 9 Open 
      Reading frame 72 (C9orf72) as the major genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) and the association between intermediate repeats in Ataxin-2 
      (ATXN2) with the disorder suggest that repetitive sequences in the human genome 
      play a significant role in ALS pathophysiology. Investigating the frequency of 
      repeat expansions in ALS in different populations and ethnic groups is therefore 
      of great importance. Based on these premises, this study aimed to define the 
      frequency of REs in the NIPA1, NOP56, and NOTCH2NLC genes and the possible 
      associations between phenotypes and the size of REs in the Italian population. 
      Using repeat-primed-PCR and PCR-fragment analyses, we screened 302 
      El-Escorial-diagnosed ALS patients and compared the RE distribution to 167 age-, 
      gender-, and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. While the REs distribution was 
      similar between the ALS and control groups, a moderate association was observed 
      between longer RE lengths and clinical features such as age at onset, gender, 
      site of onset, and family history. In conclusion, this is the first study to 
      screen ALS patients from southern Italy for REs in NIPA1, NOP56, and NOTCH2NLC 
      genes, contributing to our understanding of ALS genetics. Our results highlighted 
      that the extremely rare pathogenic REs in these genes do not allow an association 
      with the disease.

AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease, caused by a GGC repeat expansion in the 
      5'-untranslated region of NOTCH2NLC, is a rare neurodegenerative condition with 
      highly variable clinical manifestations. In recent years, the number of reported 
      cases have increased dramatically in East Asia. We report the first four 
      genetically confirmed cases of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease in New 
      Zealand, all having Polynesian ancestry (three New Zealand Maori and one Cook 
      Island Maori). Phenotypically, they resemble cases reported from recent large 
      East Asian cohorts.

TI  - The predominance of "astrocytic" intranuclear inclusions in neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusion disease manifesting encephalopathy-like symptoms: A case series with 
      brain biopsy.
PG  - 351-365
LID - 10.1111/neup.12971 [doi]
AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      represented by eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions (EIIs) and GGC/CGG repeat 
      expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene. We report here two adult cases of NIID, 
      genetically confirmed, with manifestation of encephalopathy-like symptoms and 
      address the histopathologic findings obtained by brain biopsies, with a focus on 
      "astrocytic" intranuclear inclusions (AIIs). Case 1 presented with paroxysmal 
      restlessness, vertigo, or fever and was later involved in severe dementia and 
      tetraparesis. Case 2 presented with forgetfulness and then with paroxysmal fever 
      and headache. In both cases, delimited areas with gadolinium enhancement on 
      magnetic resonance imaging and corresponding hyperperfusion were detected, 
      leading to brain biopsies of the cortex. On histology, Case 1 showed an abnormal 
      lamination, where the thickness of layers was different from usual. Both neurons 
      and astrocytes showed some dysmorphologic features. Notably, astrocytes rather 
      than neurons harbored EIIs. Case 2 showed a cortex, where neurons tended to be 
      arrayed in a columnar fashion. Astrocytes showed some dysmorphologic features. 
      Notably, much more astrocytes than neurons harbored EIIs. By a double-labeling 
      immunofluorescence study for p62/NeuN and p62/glial fibrillary acidic protein, 
      the predominance of AIIs was confirmed in both cases. Considering the 
      physiological functions of astrocytes for the development and maintenance of the 
      cortex, the encephalopathy-like symptoms, dynamic change of cerebral blood flow, 
      and cortical dysmorphology can reasonably be explained by the dysfunction of 
      EII-bearing astrocytes rather than EII-bearing neurons. This study suggests the 
      presence of a subtype of NIID where AIIs rather than "neuronal" intranuclear 
      inclusions are likely a key player in the pathogenesis of NIID, particularly in 
      cases with encephalopathy-like symptoms. The importance of AIIs ("gliopathy") 
      should be more appreciated in future studies of NIID.

TI  - Neuronal Intranuclear Inclusion Disease with NOTCH2NLC GGC Repeat Expansion: A 
      Systematic Review and Challenges of Phenotypic Characterization.
PG  - 578-97
LID - 10.14336/AD.2024.0131-1 [doi]
AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a highly clinically 
      heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder primarily attributed to abnormal GGC 
      repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene. This study aims to comprehensively 
      explore its phenotypic characteristics and genotype-phenotype correlation. A 
      literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from 
      September 1, 2019, to December 31, 2022, encompassing reported NIID cases 
      confirmed by pathogenic NOTCH2NLC mutations. Linear regressions and trend 
      analyses were performed. Analyzing 635 cases from 85 included studies revealed 
      that familial cases exhibited significantly larger GGC repeat expansions than 
      sporadic cases (p < 0.001), and this frequency significantly increased with 
      expanding GGC repeats (p trend < 0.001). Age at onset (AAO) showed a negative 
      correlation with GGC repeat expansions (p < 0.001). The predominant initial 
      symptoms included tremor (31.70%), cognitive impairment (14.12%), and muscle 
      weakness (10.66%). The decreased or absent tendon reflex (DTR/ATR) emerged as a 
      notable clinical indicator of NIID due to its high prevalence. U-fiber was 
      observed in 79.11% of patients, particularly prominent in paroxysmal 
      disease-dominant (87.50%) and dementia-dominant cases (81.08%). Peripheral 
      neuropathy-dominant cases exhibited larger GGC repeat expansions (median = 
      123.00) and an earlier AAO (median = 33.00) than other phenotypes. Moreover, a 
      significant genetic anticipation of 3.5 years was observed (p = 0.039). This 
      study provides a comprehensive and up-to-date compilation of genotypic and 
      phenotypic information on NIID since the identification of the causative gene 
      NOTCH2NLC. We contribute a novel diagnostic framework for NIID to support 
      clinical practice.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate adult-onset neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease 
      (NIID)-related retinopathy with guanine-guanine-cytosine repeat expansions in 
      NOTCH2NLC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Neuro-ophthalmic evaluations, including 
      best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure 
      (IOP), ultrasound biomicroscopy, pupillometry, fundus photography, fundus 
      autofluorescence (FAF), optical coherence tomography (OCT), Humphrey visual 
      field, full-field electroretinography (ERG), and multifocal ERG (mf-ERG) were 
      performed in patients with gene-proven NIID. RESULTS: Nine patients (18 eyes) 
      were evaluated, with a median age of 62 years (55-68) and only one man was 
      included in our study. Six patients presented with decreased visual acuity or 
      night blindness, whereas the other three were asymptomatic. The visual acuity was 
      measured from 20/200 to 20/20. Miosis was present in eight patients, four of whom 
      had ciliary process hypertrophy and pronation, and three of whom had shallow 
      anterior chambers. Fundus photography, FAF, and OCT showed consistent structural 
      abnormalities mainly started from peripapillary areas and localized in the outer 
      layer of photoreceptors and inner ganglion cell layer. ERG and mf-ERG also 
      revealed retinal dysfunction in the corresponding regions. CONCLUSION: Patients 
      with NIID showed both structural and functional retinopathies which were unique 
      and different from common cone-rod dystrophy or retinitis pigmentosa. Patients 
      with miosis may have a potential risk of an angle-closure glaucoma attack. 
      Neuro-ophthalmic evaluations is essential for evaluating patients with NIID, even 
      without visual symptom.

AB  - CGG repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC is the genetic cause of neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusion disease (NIID). Previous studies indicated that the CGG repeats can be 
      translated into polyglycine protein (N2CpolyG) which was toxic to neurons by 
      forming intranuclear inclusions (IIs). However, little is known about the factors 
      governing polyG IIs formation as well as its molecular pathogenesis. Considering 
      that neurogenetic disorders usually involve interactions between genetic and 
      environmental stresses, we investigated the effect of stress on the formation of 
      IIs. Our results revealed that under hyperosmotic stress, N2CpolyG translocated 
      from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and formed IIs in SH-SY5Y cells, recapitulating 
      the pathological hallmark of NIID patients. Furthermore, N2CpolyG interacted/ 
      co-localized with an RNA-binding protein FUS in the IIs of cellular model and 
      NIID patient tissues, thereby disrupting stress granule formation in cytoplasm 
      under hyperosmotic stress. Consequently, dysregulated expression of microRNAs was 
      found both in NIID patients and cellular model, which could be restored by FUS 
      overexpression in cultured cells. Overall, our findings indicate a mechanism of 
      stress-induced pathological changes as well as neuronal damage, and a potential 
      strategy for the treatment of NIID.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The role of GGC repeat expansions within NOTCH2NLC in 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) and the substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic neuron 
      remains unclear. Here, we profile the NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions in a large 
      cohort of patients with PD. We also investigate the role of GGC repeat expansions 
      within NOTCH2NLC in the dopaminergic neurodegeneration of SN. METHODS: A total of 
      2,522 patients diagnosed with PD and 1,085 health controls were analyzed for the 
      repeat expansions of NOTCH2NLC by repeat-primed PCR and GC-rich PCR assay. 
      Furthermore, the effects of GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC on dopaminergic 
      neurons were investigated by using recombinant adeno-associated virus 
      (AAV)-mediated overexpression of NOTCH2NLC with 98 GGC repeats in the SN of mice 
      by stereotactic injection. RESULTS: Four PD pedigrees (4/333, 1.2%) and three 
      sporadic PD patients (3/2189, 0.14%) were identified with pathogenic GGC repeat 
      expansions (larger than 60 GGC repeats) in the NOTCH2NLC gene, while eight PD 
      patients and one healthy control were identified with intermediate GGC repeat 
      expansions ranging from 41 to 60 repeats. No significant difference was observed 
      in the distribution of intermediate NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions between PD 
      cases and controls (Fisher's exact test p-value = 0.29). Skin biopsy showed 
      P62-positive intranuclear NOTCH2NLC-polyGlycine (polyG) inclusions in the skin 
      nerve fibers of patient. Expanded GGC repeats in NOTCH2NLC produced widespread 
      intranuclear and perinuclear polyG inclusions, which led to a severe loss of 
      dopaminergic neurons in the SN. Consistently, polyG inclusions were presented in 
      the SN of EIIa-NOTCH2NLC-(GGC)98 transgenic mice and also led to dopaminergic 
      neuron loss in the SN. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings provide strong evidence 
      that GGC repeat expansions within NOTCH2NLC contribute to the pathogenesis of PD 
      and cause degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons.

TI  - Non-coding CGG repeat expansion in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 is associated with a 
      phenotype of oculopharyngodistal myopathy.
PG  - 340-346
LID - 10.1136/jmg-2023-109345 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is a rare adult-onset 
      neuromuscular disease, associated with CGG repeat expansions in the 5' 
      untranslated region of LRP12, GIPC1, NOTCH2NLC and RILPL1. However, the genetic 
      cause of a proportion of pathoclinically confirmed cases remains unknown. 
      METHODS: A total of 26 OPDM patients with unknown genetic cause(s) from 4 
      tertiary referral hospitals were included in this study. Clinical data and 
      laboratory findings were collected. Muscle samples were observed by histological 
      and immunofluorescent staining. Long-read sequencing was initially conducted in 
      six patients with OPDM. Repeat-primed PCR was used to screen the CGG repeat 
      expansions in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 in all 26 patients. RESULTS: We identified CGG 
      repeat expansion in the non-coding transcripts of LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 in another 
      two unrelated Chinese cases with typical pathoclinical features of OPDM. The 
      repeat expansion was more than 70 times in the patients but less than 40 times in 
      the normal controls. Both patients showed no leucoencephalopathy but one showed 
      mild cognitive impairment detected by Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Rimmed 
      vacuoles and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions (INIs) were identified in 
      muscle pathology, and colocalisation of CGG RNA foci with p62 was also found in 
      the INIs of patient-derived fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: We identified another two 
      unrelated cases with CGG repeat expansion in the long non-coding RNA of the 
      LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 gene, presenting with a phenotype of OPDM. Our cases 
      broadened the recognised phenotypic spectrum and pathogenesis in the disease 
      associated with CGG repeat expansion in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an autosomal dominant 
      adult-onset degenerative muscle disorder characterized by ptosis, ophthalmoplegia 
      and weakness of the facial, pharyngeal and limb muscles. Trinucleotide repeat 
      expansions in non-coding regions of LRP12, G1PC1, NOTCH2NLC and RILPL1 were 
      reported to be the etiologies for OPDM. RESULTS: In this study, we performed 
      long-read whole-genome sequencing in a large five-generation family of 156 
      individuals, including 21 patients diagnosed with typical OPDM. We identified CGG 
      repeat expansions in 5'UTR of RILPL1 gene in all patients we tested while no CGG 
      expansion in unaffected family members. Repeat-primed PCR and fluorescence 
      amplicon length analysis PCR were further confirmed the segregation of CGG 
      expansions in other family members and 1000 normal Chinese controls. Methylation 
      analysis indicated that methylation levels of the RILPL1 gene were unaltered in 
      OPDM patients, which was consistent with previous studies. Our findings provide 
      evidence that RILPL1 is associated OPDM in this large pedigree. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results identified RILPL1 is the associated the disease in this large pedigree.

TI  - Utility of labial salivary gland biopsy in the histological diagnosis of neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusion disease.
PG  - e16102
LID - 10.1111/ene.16102 [doi]
LID - e16102
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) poses a 
      diagnostic challenge because of its diverse clinical manifestations. Detection of 
      intranuclear inclusions remains the primary diagnostic criterion for NIID. Skin 
      biopsies have traditionally been used, but concerns exist regarding postoperative 
      complications and scarring. We sought to investigate the diagnostic utility of 
      labial salivary gland biopsy, a less invasive alternative. METHODS: This study 
      included a total of 19 patients and 11 asymptomatic carriers who underwent labial 
      gland biopsies, while 10 patients opted for skin biopsies. All these individuals 
      were confirmed to have pathogenic GGC repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene. 
      The control group comprised 20 individuals matched for age and sex, all with 
      nonpathogenic GGC repeat expansions, and their labial gland tissue was sourced 
      from oral surgery specimens. RESULTS: Labial gland biopsies proved to be a highly 
      effective diagnostic method in detecting eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions in 
      NIID patients. The inclusions showed positive staining for p62 and ubiquitin, 
      confirming their pathological significance. The presence of uN2CpolyG protein in 
      the labial gland tissue further supported the diagnosis. Importantly, all 
      patients who underwent lip gland biopsy experienced fast wound healing without 
      any noticeable scarring. In contrast, skin biopsies led to varying degrees of 
      scarring and one instance of a localized infection. CONCLUSION: Labial salivary 
      gland biopsy emerged as a minimally invasive, efficient diagnostic method for 
      NIID, with rapid healing and excellent sensitivity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare 
      neurodegenerative disorder characterized by widespread intranuclear inclusions in 
      the nervous system as well as multiple visceral organs. In 2019, expanded GGC 
      repeats within the 5' untranslated region of the NOTCH2NLC gene was identified as 
      the causative factor. NIID is a heterogeneous disorder with variable clinical 
      manifestations including cognitive impairment, cerebellar ataxia, parkinsonism, 
      paroxysmal symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, and muscle weakness. Although NIID 
      primarily affects the central and peripheral nervous systems, growing evidence 
      suggests potential cardiac abnormalities in NIID. However, the link between 
      expanded GGC repeats within NOTCH2NLC and cardiac dysfunction remains uncertain. 
      RESULTS: In this study, we utilized two transgenic mouse models, expressing 
      NOTCH2NLC-(GGC)(98) ubiquitously or specifically in cardiomyocytes, and 
      identified p62 (also known as sequestosome 1, SQSTM1)-positive intranuclear 
      NOTCH2NLC-polyG inclusions in cardiomyocytes in two mouse models. We observed 
      that both models exhibited cardiac-related pathological and echocardiographic 
      changes, albeit exhibiting varying degrees of severity. Transcriptomic analysis 
      revealed shared downregulation of genes related to ion channels and mitochondria 
      in both models, with the cardiomyocyte-specific mice showing a more pronounced 
      downregulation of mitochondria and energy metabolism-related pathways. Further 
      investigations revealed decreased expression of mitochondria-related genes and 
      electron transport chain activity. At last, we conducted a retrospective review 
      of cardiac-related examination results from NIID patients at our hospital and 
      also identified some cardiac abnormalities in NIID patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      study provided the first in vivo evidence linking GGC repeat expansions within 
      NOTCH2NLC to cardiac abnormalities and highlighted the contribution of 
      mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of cardiac abnormalities.

TI  - Heterogenous Genetic, Clinical, and Imaging Features in Patients with Neuronal 
      Intranuclear Inclusion Disease Carrying NOTCH2NLC Repeat Expansion.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci13060955 [doi]
LID - 955
AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      that is caused by the abnormal expansion of non-coding trinucleotide GGC repeats 
      in NOTCH2NLC. NIID is clinically characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical 
      presentations. To date, the relationship between expanded repeat lengths and 
      clinical phenotype in patients with NIID remains unclear. Thus, we aimed to 
      clarify the genetic and clinical spectrum and their association in patients with 
      NIID. For this purpose, we genetically analyzed Japanese patients with 
      adult-onset NIID with characteristic clinical and neuroimaging findings. 
      Trinucleotide repeat expansions of NOTCH2NLC were examined by repeat-primed and 
      amplicon-length PCR. In addition, long-read sequencing was performed to determine 
      repeat size and sequence. The expanded GGC repeats ranging from 94 to 361 in 
      NOTCH2NLC were found in all 15 patients. Two patients carried biallelic repeat 
      expansions. There were marked heterogenous clinical and imaging features in NIID 
      patients. Patients presenting with cerebellar ataxia or urinary dysfunction had a 
      significantly larger GGC repeat size than those without. This significant 
      association disappeared when these parameters were compared with the total 
      trinucleotide repeat number. ARWMC score was significantly higher in patients who 
      had a non-glycine-type trinucleotide interruption within expanded poly-glycine 
      motifs than in those with a pure poly-glycine expansion. These results suggested 
      that the repeat length and sequence in NOTCH2NLC may partly modify some clinical 
      and imaging features of NIID.

AB  - With complicated conditions and a large number of potentially causative genes, 
      the diagnosis of a patient with complex inherited peripheral neuropathies (IPNs) 
      is challenging. To provide an overview of the genetic and clinical features of 39 
      families with complex IPNs from central south China and to optimize the molecular 
      diagnosis approach to this group of heterogeneous diseases, a total of 39 index 
      patients from unrelated families were enrolled, and detailed clinical data were 
      collected. TTR Sanger sequencing, hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) gene panel, 
      and dynamic mutation detection in spinocerebellar ataxia (SCAs) were performed 
      according to the respective additional clinical features. Whole-exome sequencing 
      (WES) was used in patients with negative or unclear results. Dynamic mutation 
      detection in NOTCH2NLC and RCF1 was applied as a supplement to WES. As a result, 
      an overall molecular diagnosis rate of 89.7% was achieved. All 21 patients with 
      predominant autonomic dysfunction and multiple organ system involvement carried 
      pathogenic variants in TTR, among which nine had c.349G > T (p.A97S) hotspot 
      variants. Five out of 7 patients (71.4%) with muscle involvement harbored 
      biallelic pathogenic variants in GNE. Five out of 6 patients (83.3%) with 
      spasticity reached definite genetic causes in SACS, KIF5A, BSCL2, and KIAA0196, 
      respectively. NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions were identified in all three cases 
      accompanied by chronic coughing and in one patient accompanied by cognitive 
      impairment. The pathogenic variants, p.F284S and p.G111R in GNE, and p.K4326E in 
      SACS, were first reported. In conclusion, transthyretin amyloidosis with 
      polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN), GNE myopathy, and neuronal intranuclear inclusion 
      disease (NIID) were the most common genotypes in this cohort of complex IPNs. 
      NOTCH2NLC dynamic mutation testing should be added to the molecular diagnostic 
      workflow. We expanded the genetic and related clinical spectrum of GNE myopathy 
      and ARSACS by reporting novel variants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare 
      neurodegenerative disease that can affect the nervous and other systems of the 
      body. Its clinical manifestations are complex and easily misdiagnosed. 
      Adult-onset NIID beginning with autonomic symptoms such as recurrent hypotension, 
      profuse sweating, and syncope has not been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: An 
      81-year-old male was admitted to the hospital in June 2018 due to repeated 
      episodes of hypotension, profuse sweating, pale complexion, and syncope for 3 
      years, and progressive dementia for 2 years. DWI was not possible due to the 
      presence of metal residues in the body. Cutaneous histopathology revealed sweat 
      gland cell nuclear inclusions and immunohistochemistry showed p62 nuclear 
      immunoreactivity. Blood RP-PCR identified an abnormal GGC repeat expansion in the 
      5'UTR of the NOTCH2NLC gene. Accordingly, this case was diagnosed as adult-onset 
      NIID in August 2018. The patient subsequently received vitamin C nutritional 
      support, rehydration, and other vital signs maintenance treatments during 
      hospitalization, but the above symptoms still recurred after discharge. With the 
      development of the disease, lower extremity weakness, slow movement, dementia, 
      repeated constipation, and vomiting appeared successively. In April 2019, he was 
      hospitalized again for severe pneumonia, and died of multiple organ failure in 
      June 2019. CONCLUSION: The presented case exemplifies great clinical 
      heterogeneity of NIID. Some patients may have neurological symptoms and other 
      systemic symptoms simultaneously. This patient started with autonomic symptoms, 
      including recurrent episodes of hypotension, profuse sweating, pallor, and 
      syncope, which progressed rapidly. This case report provides new information for 
      the diagnosis of NIID.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Adult onset neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease 
      (NIID) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder with a heterogeneous clinical 
      presentation that can mimic stroke and various forms of dementia. To date, it has 
      been described almost exclusively in Asian individuals. METHODS: This case 
      presentation includes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neurocranium, 
      histology by skin biopsy, and long-read genome sequencing. RESULTS: A 75-year-old 
      Caucasian female presented with paroxysmal encephalopathy twice within a 14-month 
      period. Brain MRI revealed high-intensity signals at the cerebral 
      corticomedullary junction (diffusion-weighted imaging) and the paravermal area 
      (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery), a typical distribution observed in adult 
      onset NIID. The diagnosis was corroborated by skin biopsy, which demonstrated 
      eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies, and confirmed by long-read genome 
      sequencing, showing an expansion of the GGC repeat in exon 1 of NOTCH2NLC. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our case proves adult onset NOTCH2NLC-GGC-positive NIID with typical 
      findings on MRI and histology in a Caucasian patient and underscores the need to 
      consider this diagnosis in non-Asian individuals.

LID - 10.1002/acn3.51794 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Leukoencephalopathies are a group of heterogeneous disorders 
      characterized by the degeneration of white matter, resulting in a variety of 
      progressive neurological symptoms. To date, over 60 genes linked to genetic 
      leukoencephalopathies have been discovered through whole-exome sequencing (WES) 
      and long-read sequencing. Nonetheless, the genetic diversity and clinical 
      variability of these disorders among various racial groups remain largely 
      unknown. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the genetic spectrum and clinical 
      features of Chinese adult leukoencephalopathies and compare the genetic profiles 
      in different populations. METHODS: A total of 129 patients suspected of possible 
      genetic leukoencephalopathy were enrolled and underwent WES and dynamic mutation 
      analysis. Bioinformatics tools were used to predict the pathogenicity of these 
      mutations. Skin biopsies were conducted for further diagnosis. Genetic data 
      sources from different populations were collected from published articles. 
      RESULTS: Genetic diagnosis was established in 48.1% of patients, with WES 
      identifying 57 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 39.5% of cases. NOTCH3 
      and NOTCH2NLC were the most common mutated genes, accounting for 12.4% and 8.5% 
      of cases, respectively. Dynamic mutation analysis revealed NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat 
      expansions in 8.5% of patients. Different mutations resulted in varying clinical 
      symptoms and imaging findings. Comparisons of genetic profiles between different 
      populations showed distinct mutational spectrums in adult leukoencephalopathies. 
      INTERPRETATION: This study highlights the importance of genetic testing for 
      accurate diagnosis and improved clinical management of these disorders. It also 
      sheds light on the genetic heterogeneity of adult leukoencephalopathies across 
      different races, emphasizing the need for further research on this topic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The discovery of skin intranuclear inclusions and GGC repeat 
      expansion of NOTCH2NLC has greatly promoted the diagnosis of neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). With highly heterogeneous clinical 
      manifestations, NIID patients tend to be underdiagnosed at early stages. METHODS: 
      This study comprehensively studied clinical manifestations, magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI), and peripheral nerve conduction in 24 NIID and 166 other 
      neurodegenerative disease (ND) subjects. The nomogram was plotted using the "rms" 
      package, and the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding algorithm was 
      performed. Associations between skin intranuclear inclusions and NOTCH2NLC GGC 
      repeats were further analyzed. RESULTS: The clinical, MRI, and peripheral nerve 
      conduction features seriously overlapped in NIID and ND patients; they were 
      assigned variables according to their frequency and specificity in NIID patients. 
      A nomogram that could distinguish NIID from ND was constructed according to the 
      assigned variables and cutoff values of the above features. The occurrence of 
      skin intranuclear inclusions and NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats >/= 60 showed 100% 
      consistency, and intranuclear inclusion frequency positively correlated with 
      NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats. A hierarchical diagnostic flowchart for definite NIID was 
      further established. CONCLUSION: We provide a novel nomogram with the potential 
      to realize early identification and update the diagnostic flowchart for 
      definitive diagnosis. Moreover, this is the first study to define the association 
      between skin pathology and NOTCH2NLC genetics in NIID.

AB  - The retinal pathology of genetically confirmed neuronal intranuclear inclusion 
      disease (NIID) is yet unknown. We report the ocular findings in four NIID 
      patients with NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion to investigate the pathology of 
      retinopathy. All four NIID patients were diagnosed by skin biopsy and NOTCH2NLC 
      GGC repeat analysis. Ocular findings in patients with NIID were studied using 
      fundus photographs, optical coherence tomographic images (OCT), and full-field 
      electroretinograms (ERGs). The histopathology of the retina was studied on 
      autopsy samples from two cases with immunohistochemistry. All patients had an 
      expansion of the GGC repeat (87-134 repeats) in the NOTCH2NLC. Two patients were 
      legally blind and had been diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa prior to the 
      diagnosis of NIID and assessed with whole exome sequencing to rule out 
      comorbidity with other retinal diseases. Fundus photographs around the posterior 
      pole showed chorioretinal atrophy in the peripapillary regions. OCT showed 
      thinning of the retina. ERGs showed various abnormalities in cases. The 
      histopathology of autopsy samples showed diffusely scattered intranuclear 
      inclusions throughout the retina from the retinal pigment epithelium to the 
      ganglion cell layer, and optic nerve glial cells. And severe gliosis was observed 
      in retina and optic nerve. The NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion causes numerous 
      intranuclear inclusions in the retina and optic nerve cells and gliosis. Visual 
      dysfunction could be the first sign of NIID. We should consider NIID as one of 
      the causes of retinal dystrophy and investigate the GGC repeat expansion in 
      NOTCH2NLC.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion body disease (NIID) is 
      a neurodegenerative disease with highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations. 
      The present study aimed to characterize clinical features and propose a 
      classification system based on a large cohort of NIID in China. METHODS: The 
      Chinese NIID registry was launched from 2017, and participants' demographics and 
      clinical features were recorded. Brain MRI, skin pathologies, and the number of 
      GGC repeat expansions in the 5' untranslated region of the NOTCH2NLC gene were 
      evaluated in all patients. RESULTS: In total, 223 patients (64.6% female) were 
      recruited; the mean (SD) onset age was 56.7 (10.3) years. The most common 
      manifestations were cognitive impairment (78.5%) and autonomic dysfunction 
      (70.9%), followed by episodic symptoms (51.1%), movement disorders (50.7%), and 
      muscle weakness (25.6%). Imaging markers included hyperintensity signals along 
      the corticomedullary junction on diffusion-weighted imaging (96.6%), white matter 
      lesions (98.1%), paravermis (55.0%), and focal cortical lesions (10.1%). The 
      median size of the expanded GGC repeats in these patients was 115 (range, 
      70-525), with 2 patients carrying >300 GGC repeats. A larger number of GGC 
      repeats was associated with younger age at onset (r = -0.329, p < 0.0001). 
      According to the proposed clinical classification based on the most prominent 
      manifestations, the patients were designated into 5 distinct types: cognitive 
      impairment-dominant type (34.1%, n = 76), episodic neurogenic event-dominant type 
      (32.3%, n = 72), movement disorder-dominant type (17.5%, n = 39), autonomic 
      dysfunction-dominant type (8.5%, n = 19), and neuromuscular disease-dominant type 
      (7.6%, n = 17). Notably, 32.3% of the episodic neurogenic event-dominant type of 
      NIID has characteristic focal cortical lesions on brain MRI presenting localized 
      cortical edema or atrophy. The mean onset age of the neuromuscular 
      disease-dominant type was 47.2 (17.6) years, younger than the other types (p < 
      0.001). There was no significant difference in the sizes of GGC repeats among the 
      patients in the 5 types (p = 0.547, Kruskal-Wallis test). DISCUSSION: This 
      observational study of NIID establishes an overall picture of the disease 
      regarding clinical, imaging, and genetic characteristics. The proposed clinical 
      classification of NIID based on the most prominent manifestation divides patients 
      into 5 types.

AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a clinically complex 
      neurological disorder that appears sporadically or autosomally. Expansions of 
      intronic GGC trinucleotide repeats in the NOTCH2 N-terminal-like C (NOTCH2NLC) 
      gene cause NIID. In this study, to clarify the clinical characteristics useful 
      for the differential diagnosis of NIID, clinical data of neurological 
      examination, neuroimaging, and nerve conduction studies of six NIID patients 
      diagnosed by pathological or genetic investigations were analyzed. Clinically 
      useful characteristics for diagnosing NIID include general hyporeflexia, episodic 
      disturbance of consciousness, sensory disturbance, miosis, and dementia. 
      Furthermore, neuroimaging findings, such as leukoencephalopathy in T2-weighted 
      magnetic resonance imaging and a linear high intensity of subcortical U-fibers in 
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), as well as decreased motor nerve conduction 
      velocity, are especially important biomarkers for NIID. However, it is necessary 
      to remember that these features may not always be present, as shown in one of the 
      cases who did not have a DWI abnormality in this study. This study also 
      investigated whether expanded GGC repeats were translated into polyglycine. 
      Immunohistochemical analysis using a custom antibody raised against putative 
      C-terminal polypeptides followed by polyglycine of uN2CpolyG revealed that 
      polyglycines were localized in the intranuclear inclusions in skin biopsy 
      specimens from all six patients, suggesting its involvement in the pathogenesis 
      of NIID.

AB  - BACKGROUND: NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions have been associated with various 
      neurogenerative disorders, including neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease and 
      inherited peripheral neuropathies (IPNs). However, only a few NOTCH2NLC-related 
      disease studies in IPN have been reported, and the clinical and genetic spectra 
      remain unclear. Thus, this study aimed to describe the clinical and genetic 
      manifestations of NOTCH2NLC-related IPNs. METHOD: Among 2692 Japanese patients 
      clinically diagnosed with IPN/Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), we analysed 
      NOTCH2NLC repeat expansion in 1783 unrelated patients without a genetic 
      diagnosis. Screening and repeat size determination of NOTCH2NLC repeat expansion 
      were performed using repeat-primed PCR and fluorescence amplicon length 
      analysis-PCR. RESULTS: NOTCH2NLC repeat expansions were identified in 26 cases of 
      IPN/CMT from 22 unrelated families. The mean median motor nerve conduction 
      velocity was 41 m/s (range, 30.8-59.4), and 18 cases (69%) were classified as 
      intermediate CMT. The mean age of onset was 32.7 (range, 7-61) years. In addition 
      to motor sensory neuropathy symptoms, dysautonomia and involuntary movements were 
      common (44% and 29%). Furthermore, the correlation between the age of onset or 
      clinical symptoms and the repeat size remains unclear. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings of this study help us understand the clinical heterogeneity of 
      NOTCH2NLC-related disease, such as non-length-dependent motor dominant phenotype 
      and prominent autonomic involvement. This study also emphasise the importance of 
      genetic screening, regardless of the age of onset and type of CMT, particularly 
      in patients of Asian origin, presenting with intermediate conduction velocities 
      and dysautonomia.

TI  - NOTCH2NLC GGC Repeat Expansion in Patients With Vascular Leukoencephalopathy.
PG  - 1236-1245
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.122.041848 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID), caused by GGC 
      (guanine-guanine-cytosine) repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC, has several clinical 
      and radiological features akin to cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD). The 
      present study tested the hypothesis that NOTCH2NLC GGC expansion may contribute 
      to cSVD. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-seven unrelated patients with 
      genetically unsolved vascular leukoencephalopathy without NOTCH3, HTRA1, and 
      mitochondrial m.3243A>G mutations and 730 healthy individuals were screened for 
      NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion using repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction, 
      fragment analysis, Southern blot analysis, or nanopore sequencing with Cas9 
      (CRISPR associated protein 9)-mediated enrichment. The clinical and neuroimaging 
      features of the patients were compared between individuals with and without 
      NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion. RESULTS: Six of the 197 (3.0%) patients with 
      unsolved vascular leukoencephalopathy and none of the controls carried the GGC 
      repeat expansion (P=0.00009). Skin biopsy of 1 patient revealed eosinophilic, 
      ubiquitin-positive, and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in the cells of 
      sweat gland and capillary, providing pathologic evidence for the involvement of 
      small vessels in NIID. For the 6 patients, gait disturbance and cognitive decline 
      were common manifestations with a median onset age of 65 (59-69) years. They all 
      had multiple neuroimaging features suggestive of cSVD, including diffuse white 
      matter hyperintensities, lacunes, and enlarged perivascular space in all 6 
      patients, cerebral microbleeds in 5, and old intracerebral hemorrhage in 4. Four 
      patients had linear hyperintensity in the corticomedullary junction on 
      diffusion-weighted imaging-the characteristic neuroimaging feature of NIID. There 
      was no difference in the severity of cSVD imaging features between the patients 
      with and without the GGC expansion but more pronounced brain atrophy in the 
      patients with the GGC expansion. CONCLUSIONS: NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion 
      accounted for 3% of genetically unsolved Taiwanese vascular leukoencephalopathy 
      cases after excluding participants with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy 
      with subcortical infarct and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), cerebral autosomal 
      recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy 
      (CARASIL), and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like 
      episodes (MELAS). NIID should be considered in patients manifesting cSVD, 
      especially in those with characteristic neuroimaging feature of NIID.

TI  - GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC induces dysfunction in ribosome biogenesis and 
      translation.
PG  - 3373-3391
LID - 10.1093/brain/awad058 [doi]
AB  - GGC repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of NOTCH2NLC is 
      associated with a broad spectrum of neurological disorders, especially neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). Studies have found that GGC repeat 
      expansion in NOTCH2NLC induces the formation of polyglycine (polyG)-containing 
      protein, which is involved in the formation of neuronal intranuclear inclusions. 
      However, the mechanism of neurotoxicity induced by NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats is 
      unclear. Here, we used NIID patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell 
      (iPSC)-derived 3D cerebral organoids (3DCOs) and cellular models to investigate 
      the pathophysiological mechanisms of NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion. IPSC-derived 
      3DCOs and cellular models showed the deposition of polyG-containing intranuclear 
      inclusions. The NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats could induce the upregulation of autophagic 
      flux, enhance integrated stress response and activate EIF2alpha phosphorylation. Bulk 
      RNA sequencing for iPSC-derived neurons and single-cell RNA sequencing 
      (scRNA-seq) for iPSC-derived 3DCOs revealed that NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats may be 
      associated with dysfunctions in ribosome biogenesis and translation. Moreover, 
      NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats could induce the NPM1 nucleoplasm translocation, increase 
      nucleolar stress, impair ribosome biogenesis and induce ribosomal RNA 
      sequestration, suggesting dysfunction of membraneless organelles in the NIID 
      cellular model. Dysfunctions in ribosome biogenesis and phosphorylated EIF2alpha and 
      the resulting increase in the formation of G3BP1-positive stress granules may 
      together lead to whole-cell translational inhibition, which may eventually cause 
      cell death. Interestingly, scRNA-seq revealed that NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats may be 
      associated with a significantly decreased proportion of immature neurons while 
      3DCOs were developing. Together, our results underscore the value of 
      patient-specific iPSC-derived 3DCOs in investigating the mechanisms of polyG 
      diseases, especially those caused by repeats in human-specific genes.

AB  - Repeat expansions in genes other than C9orf72 and ATXN2 have been recently 
      associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Indeed, an abnormal number 
      of GGC repeats in NOTCH2NLC has been recently reported in 0.7% of sporadic ALS 
      patients from mainland China. This finding was not confirmed in an ALS cohort of 
      subjects from Taiwan. As the involvement of expanded NOTCH2NLC alleles in ALS is 
      debated, we addressed this point by evaluating NOTCH2NLC repeat expansions in an 
      Italian cohort of ALS patients. A screening analysis of NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats was 
      performed by repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR) in a cohort of 385 
      probable/definite ALS Italian patients. Mean age at onset was 60.5 years (SD 
      13.7), and 60.9% were males. Sporadic cases were 357 (92.7%), and most patients 
      had a spinal onset (71.8%). None of our patients showed the typical sawtooth tail 
      pattern on RP-PCR, thus excluding abnormal repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC. 
      Overall, we suggest that NOTCH2NLC expanded alleles might be absent or at least 
      extremely rare in ALS Italian patients. Further investigations in larger cohorts 
      with different ethnic backgrounds are required to support the involvement of 
      NOTCH2NLC in ALS.

AB  - The GGC repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene are associated with multiple 
      neurodegenerative disorders. Herein, we report the clinical phenotype in a family 
      with biallelic GGC expansions in NOTCH2NLC. Autonomic dysfunction was a prominent 
      clinical manifestation in three genetically confirmed patients without dementia, 
      parkinsonism, and cerebellar ataxia for > 12 years. A 7-T brain magnetic 
      resonance imaging in two patients revealed a change in the small cerebral veins. 
      The biallelic GGC repeat expansions may not modify the disease progression in 
      neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease. Autonomic dysfunction-dominant may 
      expand the clinical phenotype of NOTCH2NLC.

PG  - 1411-1414
LID - 10.1007/s10072-023-06644-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the variable nature of clinical manifestations, neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is regarded as a heterogeneous disease 
      which is challenging to diagnose early. To the present, progressive supranuclear 
      palsy (PSP)-like symptoms have never been listed in the performance of NIID. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old man presented with progressive Parkinsonism and 
      postural instability for 3 years. Initially, he was considered as probable PSP 
      due to vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, postural instability, and hummingbird 
      sign. No high-intensity signal on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was revealed. 
      Eventually, the diagnosis was revised to NIID by Notch 2 N-terminal like C 
      (NOTCH2NLC) GGC repeat expansions and skin biopsy showing intranuclear 
      eosinophilic inclusions in the vesicles and ductal epithelial cells of sweat 
      glands. CONCLUSION: Even if the typical high-intensity along the corticomedullary 
      junction (CMJ) on DWI is lacking, clinicians should be alert to the possibility 
      of NIID when PSP-like symptoms develop. This case report offers new features of 
      NIID and expands its clinical spectrum.

TI  - Intermediate-Length GGC Repeat Expansion in NOTCH2NLC Was Identified in Chinese 
      Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci13010085 [doi]
LID - 85
AB  - GGC repeat expansions in the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the Notch Homolog 
      2 N-terminal-like C gene (NOTCH2NLC) have been reported to be the genetic cause 
      of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). However, whether they exist in 
      other neurodegenerative disorders remains unclear. To determine whether there is 
      a medium-length amplification of NOTCH2NLC in patients with amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS), we screened 476 ALS patients and 210 healthy controls for the 
      presence of a GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC by using repeat-primed polymerase 
      chain reaction (RP-PCR) and fragment analysis. The repeat number in ALS patients 
      was 16.11 +/- 5.7 (range 7-46), whereas the repeat number in control subjects was 
      16.19 +/- 3.79 (range 10-29). An intermediate-length GGC repeat expansion was 
      observed in two ALS patients (numbers of repeats: 45, 46; normal repeat number </= 
      40) but not in the control group. The results suggested that the intermediate 
      NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion was associated with Chinese ALS patients, and 
      further functional studies for intermediate-length variation are required to 
      identify the mechanism.

AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized by eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions in the neurons, 
      glial cells, and other somatic cells. Although CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC 
      have been identified in most East Asian patients with NIID, the pathophysiology 
      of NIID remains unclear. Ubiquitin- and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions are 
      the pathological hallmark of NIID. Targeted immunostaining studies have 
      identified several other proteins present in these inclusions. However, the 
      global molecular changes within nuclei with these inclusions remained unclear. 
      Herein, we analyzed the proteomic profile of nuclei with p62-positive inclusions 
      in a NIID patient with CGG repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC to discover candidate 
      proteins involved in the NIID pathophysiology. We used fluorescence-activated 
      cell sorting and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to 
      quantify each protein identified in the nuclei with p62-positive inclusions. The 
      distribution of increased proteins was confirmed via immunofluorescence in 
      autopsy brain samples from three patients with genetically confirmed NIID. 
      Overall, 526 proteins were identified, of which 243 were consistently quantified 
      using MS. A 1.4-fold increase was consistently observed for 20 proteins in nuclei 
      with p62-positive inclusions compared to those without. Fifteen proteins 
      identified with medium or high confidence in the LC-MS/MS analysis were further 
      evaluated. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed enrichment of several terms, 
      including poly(A) RNA binding, nucleosomal DNA binding, and protein binding. 
      Immunofluorescence studies confirmed that the fluorescent intensities of 
      increased RNA-binding proteins identified by proteomic analysis, namely hnRNP 
      A2/B1, hnRNP A3, and hnRNP C1/C2, were higher in the nuclei with p62-positive 
      inclusions than in those without, which were not confined to the intranuclear 
      inclusions. We identified several increased proteins in nuclei with p62-positive 
      inclusions. Although larger studies are needed to validate our results, these 
      proteomic data may form the basis for understanding the pathophysiology of NIID.

AB  - Adult-onset neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare 
      neurodegenerative disorder with high clinical heterogeneity. Previous studies 
      indicated that the high-intensity signals in the corticomedullary junction on 
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) on brain MRI, known as the "ribbon sign," could 
      serve as a strong diagnostic clue. Here we used the explorative approach to study 
      the undiagnosed rate of adult-onset NIID in a single center in China via 
      searching for the ribbon sign in picture archive and communication system (PACS) 
      and report the clinical and radiological features of initially undiagnosed NIID 
      patients. Consecutive brain MRI of 21,563 adult individuals (>/=18 years) in the 
      PACS database in 2019 from a tertiary hospital were reviewed. Of them, 4,130 were 
      screened out using the keywords "leukoencephalopathy" and "white matter 
      demyelination." Next, all 4,130 images were read by four neurologists. The images 
      with the suspected ribbon sign were reanalyzed by two neuroradiologists. Those 
      with the ribbon sign but without previously diagnosed NIID were invited for skin 
      biopsy and/or genetic testing for diagnostic confirmation. The clinical features 
      of all NIID patients were retrospectively reviewed. Five patients with 
      high-intensity in the corticomedullary junction on DWI were enrolled. Three 
      patients were previously diagnosed with NIID confirmed by genetic or pathological 
      findings and presented with episodic encephalopathy or cognitive impairment. The 
      other two patients were initially diagnosed with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 
      (LGMD) with rimmed vacuoles (RVs) and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) in one 
      each. Genetic analysis demonstrated GGC repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene of 
      both, and skin biopsy of the first patient showed the presence of intranuclear 
      hyaline inclusion bodies. Thus, five of the 21,563 adult patients (>/=18 years) 
      were diagnosed with NIID. The distinctive subcortical high-intensity signal on 
      DWI was distributed extensively throughout the lobes, corpus callosum, basal 
      ganglia, and brainstem. In addition, T2-weighted imaging revealed white matter 
      hyperintensity of Fazekas grade 2 or 3, atrophy, and ventricular dilation. 
      Distinctive DWI hyperintensity in the junction between the gray and white matter 
      can help identify atypical NIID cases. Our findings highly suggest that 
      neurologists and radiologists should recognize the characteristic neuroimaging 
      pattern of NIID.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID), which pathogenesis 
      remains largely unclear, is a neurodegenerative disease caused by GGC repeat 
      expansion in NOTCH2NLC gene. As case studies have reported dynamic cortical 
      perfusion changes in NIID, this study aimed to explore the cerebral perfusion 
      pattern in NIID patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 38 NIID patients and 
      34 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited, and 2 NIID patients who had had 
      episodic symptoms within 2 months were excluded. Data on demographic 
      characteristics and clinical features were collected. All participants underwent 
      three-dimensional pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling perfusion magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. Voxel-based comparisons of cerebral blood flow 
      (CBF) were conducted. RESULTS: NIID patients showed decreased perfusion in the 
      cortex but increased perfusion in the deep brain regions compared with HCs. The 
      regions with significant hypoperfusion were distributed in the bilateral frontal, 
      temporal, parietal, and occipital gyri, with the left frontal gyrus being the 
      most prominent. The regions with significant hyperperfusion included the 
      bilateral basal ganglia, midbrain, pons, para-hippocampal, and parts of the 
      bilateral cerebellum, fusiform, lingual, rectus, orbital, and cingulum anterior 
      gyri, which were adjacent to the midline (all FDR-corrected p <0.05). When 
      comparing the mean CBF value of the whole brain, no significant differences were 
      observed between NIID patients and HCs (28.81 +/- 10.1 vs. 27.99 +/- 5.68 ml/100 
      g*min, p = 0.666). Voxel-based analysis showed no significant difference in 
      cerebral perfusion between NIID patients with and without episodic symptoms. The 
      perfusion within the bilateral middle frontal and anterior cingulate gyri showed 
      positive correlations with MMSE and MoCA scores using age, sex, and education as 
      covariates (p <0.005 uncorrected). CONCLUSION: NIID patients exhibited 
      characteristic cortical hypoperfusion and deep brain hyperperfusion. The 
      perfusion in the bilateral frontal lobe and cingulate gyrus was correlated with 
      the severity of cognitive dysfunction. Cerebral perfusion change may be involved 
      in NIID pathophysiology and serve as a potential indicator for monitoring NIID 
      severity and progression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare chronic 
      progressive neurodegenerative disease, with complex and diverse clinical 
      manifestations and pathological eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions in 
      the central and peripheral nervous systems and visceral organs. Improvements in 
      diagnostic methods such as skin biopsy and gene testing are helpful in revealing 
      the clinical and genetic characters of NIID. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We presented 
      two cases of NIID diagnosed by using NOTCH2NLC gene testing and skin biopsy. 
      Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) showed high linear intensity in corticomedullary 
      junction. We also reviewed all the published NIID cases with positive NOTCH2NLC 
      GGC repeat expansion and skin biopsy results in PubMed. RESULTS: Patient 1 was a 
      63-year-old male who carried 148 GGC repeats and presented with progressive 
      tremor and limb weakness. Patient 2 was a 62-year-old woman who carried 131 GGC 
      repeats and presented with tremors, memory loss and headaches. The most common 
      clinical manifestation of 63 NIID patients in this study was cognitive 
      impairment, followed by tremors. In our study, almost all the patients were from 
      East Asia, the male to female ratio was 1:1.26, with an age of onset of 54.12 +/- 
      14.12 years, and an age of diagnosis of 60.03 +/- 12.21 years. Symmetrical high 
      signal intensity at the corticomedullary junction on DWI were revealed in 80.96% 
      of the patients. For the GGC repeat numbers, the majority of GGC repeats were in 
      the 80-119 intervals, with few GGC repeats above 160. The number of GGC 
      repetitions was significantly higher in patients presented with muscle weakness 
      than in other clinical manifestations. CONCLUSION: NIID is a neurodegenerative 
      disease caused by aberrant polyglycine (polyG) protein aggregation. NIID mostly 
      occurs in the elderly population in East Asia, with cognitive dysfunction as the 
      most common symptom. Staging NIID based on clinical presentation is inappropriate 
      because most patients with NIID have overlapping symptoms. In our study, there 
      was no significant correlation between the number of GGC repeats and different 
      phenotypes except for muscle weakness. Abnormal trinucleotides repeat and PolyG 
      protein aggregation maybe common pathogenic mechanism in neurodegenerative 
      diseases and cerebrovascular diseases, which needs to be confirmed by more 
      studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare neurological 
      degenerative disorder with diverse manifestations and inadequate awareness. Only 
      a few cases of NIID have been reported, and typical imaging findings can provide 
      certain clues for the diagnosis of the disease. Furthermore, skin biopsy and 
      genetic testing are important to confirm the diagnosis. CASE SUMMARY: An 
      84-year-old man presented to the Neurology Department of our hospital complaining 
      of a progressive course of cognitive impairment and unsteady gait for 2 years. 
      The symptoms gradually progressed and affected his daily life. The patient was 
      initially diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and vascular dementia. The patient 
      did not respond to conventional treatment, such as dopasehydrazine. Therefore, 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. Based on the imaging findings, we 
      suspected an NIID diagnosis. During the 3-year follow-up in our hospital, his 
      clinical symptoms gradually progressed, and imaging findings became more 
      significant. A high signal intensity along the corticomedullary junction 
      persisted on MRI. Gene testing and skin biopsy were recommended in our hospital; 
      however, the patient refused these procedures. NIID was also considered when he 
      went to a superior hospital in Shanghai. The patient eventually agreed to undergo 
      gene testing. This revealed abnormal GGC repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene. 
      CONCLUSION: The clinical manifestations of NIID are diverse. Patients with 
      clinical manifestations similar to Parkinson's disease and dementia may have 
      NIID.

AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a neurological disorder 
      characterized by eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions (INI) in systemic organs 
      and various cell types. High-intensity signals along the corticomedullary 
      junction on diffusion-weighted imaging and presence of cellular p62-INI in skin 
      biopsy are known indicators for NIID. Furthermore, GGC repeat expansion in 
      NOTCH2NLC is a characteristic genetic alteration in patients with NIID. This 
      report presents the clinical and detailed pathological features of a male older 
      adult with NIID. We also confirmed the presence of fluid-attenuated inversion 
      recovery high-intensity signals in the cerebellar paravermal area, showing 
      similar pathological changes in high-intensity signals along the corticomedullary 
      junction on diffusion-weighted imaging.

TI  - Expression of expanded GGC repeats within NOTCH2NLC causes behavioral deficits

      disease.

AB  - GGC repeat expansions within NOTCH2NLC have been identified as the genetic cause 
      of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). To understand the molecular 
      pathogenesis of NIID, here, we established both a transgenic mouse model and a 
      human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) model. Expression of the NOTCH2NLC with 
      expanded GGC repeats produced widespread intranuclear and perinuclear polyglycine 
      (polyG), polyalanine (polyA), and polyarginine (polyR) inclusions, leading to 
      behavioral deficits and severe neurodegeneration, which faithfully mimicked the 
      clinical and pathological features associated with NIID. Furthermore, conserved 
      alternative splicing events were identified between the NIID mouse and hNPC 
      models, among which was the enrichment of the binding motifs of hnRNPM, an RNA 
      binding protein known as alternative splicing regulator. Expanded NOTCH2NLC-polyG 
      and NOTCH2NLC-polyA could interact with and sequester hnRNPM, while 
      overexpression of hnRNPM could ameliorate the cellular toxicity. These results 
      together suggested that dysfunction of hnRNPM could play an important role in the 
      molecular pathogenesis of NIID.

TI  - Subclinical peripheral neuropathy is common in neuronal intranuclear inclusion 
      disease with dominant encephalopathy.
PG  - 527-537
LID - 10.1111/ene.15606 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is 
      associated with CGG repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene. Although pure or 
      dominant peripheral neuropathy has been described as a subtype of NIID in a few 
      patients, most NIID patients predominantly show involvements of the central 
      nervous system (CNS). It is necessary to further explore whether these patients 
      have subclinical peripheral neuropathy. METHODS: Twenty-eight NIID patients, 
      clinically characterized by CNS-dominant involvements, were recruited from two 
      tertiary hospitals. Standard nerve conduction studies were performed in all 
      patients. Skin and sural nerve biopsies were performed in 28 and 15 patients, 
      respectively. Repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction and amplicon length 
      polymerase chain reaction were used to screen the CGG repeat expansion in 
      NOTCH2NLC. RESULTS: All 28 patients can be diagnosed with NIID based on skin 
      pathological and genetic changes. All patients predominantly showed CNS symptoms 
      mainly characterized by episodic encephalopathy and cognitive impairments, but no 
      clinical symptoms of peripheral neuropathy could be observed initially. 
      Electrophysiological abnormalities were found in 96.4% (27/28) of these patients, 
      indicating that subclinical peripheral neuropathy is common in NIID patients with 
      CNS-dominant type. Electrophysiological and neuropathological studies revealed 
      that demyelinating degeneration was the main pathological pattern in these 
      patients, although mild axonal degeneration was also observed in some patients. 
      No significant association between CGG repeat size and the change of nerve 
      conduction velocity was found in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      demonstrated that most patients with CNS-dominant NIID had subclinical peripheral 
      neuropathy. Electrophysiological examination should be the routinely diagnostic 
      workflow for every NIID patient.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. 
      Pathologically, it is characterized by beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary 
      tangles. There are several genes have been found to relate to AD, including the 
      human-specific Notch2 N terminal-like C (NOTCH2NLC) gene. The CGG repeat 
      expansion in NOTCH2NLC has been reported in clinically diagnosed AD patients. 
      However, it has not been reported in pathologically confirmed AD cases. In this 
      study, we detected the NOTCH2NLC CGG repeat expansion in pathologically confirmed 
      AD brain samples by repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR) and fluorescence amplicon length 
      analysis PCR (AL-PCR). As a result, the intermediate-length CGG repeat expansion 
      in NOTCH2NLC was validated in one out of 39 pathologically confirmed AD cases. 
      Pathologically, p62 positive intranuclear inclusions were observed in wide brain 
      areas, and most inclusions appeared to be presented in the glial cells. In 
      summary, our study found that the intermediate-length CGG repeat expansion in 
      NOTCH2NLC was associated with pathologically confirmed AD. The p62-positive 
      intranuclear inclusions could co-exist with AD neuropathologic changes. These 
      data suggest that the association of NOTCH2NLC CGG repeat expansion with AD may 
      be stronger than in previous studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: GGC repeat expansions in the human-specific NOTCH2NLC gene have been 
      reported as the cause of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). Given 
      the clinical overlap of cognitive impairment in NIID and cerebral small vessel 
      disease (CSVD), both diseases have white matter hyperintensity on 
      T2-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences of brain MRI, and white matter 
      hyperintensity is a primary neuroimaging marker of CSVD on MRI. Therefore, we 
      hypothesised that the GGC repeat expansions might also contribute to CSVD. To 
      further investigate the relationship between NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions and 
      CSVD, we performed a genetic analysis of 814 patients with the disease. METHODS: 
      We performed a comprehensive GGC repeat expansion screening in NOTCH2NLC from 814 
      patients with sporadic CSVD. Their Fazekas score was greater than or equal to 3 
      points. Repeat-primed PCR and fluorescence amplicon length analyses were 
      performed to identify GGC repeat expansions, and whole-exome sequencing was used 
      to detect any pathogenic mutation in previously reported genes associated with 
      CSVD. RESULTS: We identified nine (1.11%) patients with pathogenic GGC repeat 
      expansions ranging from 41 to 98 repeats. The minor allele frequency of expanded 
      GGC repeats in NOTCH2NLC was 0.55%. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that 
      intermediate-length and longer-length GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC are 
      associated with sporadic CSVD. This provides new thinking for studying the 
      pathogenesis of CSVD.

AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a 
      neuromuscular/neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion of CGG repeats in 
      the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the NOTCH2NLC gene. These repeats can be 
      translated into a polyglycine-containing protein, uN2CpolyG, which forms protein 
      inclusions and is toxic in cell models, albeit through an unknown mechanism. 
      Here, we established a transgenic Drosophila model expressing uN2CpolyG in 
      multiple systems, which resulted in progressive neuronal cell loss, locomotor 
      deficiency, and shortened lifespan. Interestingly, electron microscopy revealed 
      mitochondrial swelling both in transgenic flies and in muscle biopsies of 
      individuals with NIID. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy showed 
      colocalization of uN2CpolyG with mitochondria in cell and patient samples, while 
      biochemical analysis revealed that uN2CpolyG interacted with a mitochondrial RNA 
      binding protein, LRPPRC (leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat motif-containing 
      protein). Furthermore, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis and functional assays 
      showed down-regulated mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in 
      uN2CpolyG-expressing flies and NIID muscle biopsies. Finally, idebenone treatment 
      restored mitochondrial function and alleviated neurodegenerative phenotypes in 
      transgenic flies. Overall, these results indicate that transgenic flies 
      expressing uN2CpolyG recapitulate key features of NIID and that reversing 
      mitochondrial dysfunction might provide a potential therapeutic approach for this 
      disorder.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is 
      currently based on CGG repeat expansion in the 5'UTR of the NOTCH2NLC gene, or 
      p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in skin biopsy. The purpose of this study is 
      to explore the value of non-invasive pathological findings in urine sediment 
      cells from NIID patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients with clinically 
      suspected NIID were enrolled for skin biopsy and gene screening. Morning urine 
      (500 ml) was collected from each patient, and cell sediment was obtained by 
      centrifugation. Urine cytology, including Giemsa staining, p62 immunostaining, 
      and electron microscopic examination, were conducted on cell sediment. RESULTS: 
      The main clinical symptoms of 10 patients included episodic disturbance of 
      consciousness, cognitive impairment, tremor, limb weakness, and so on. Cerebral 
      MRI showed that 9 patients had linear DWI high signal in the corticomedullary 
      junction. Genetic testing found that the number of CGG repeat ranged from 96 to 
      158 in the NOTCH2NLC gene. Skin biopsy revealed that all patients showed 
      p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in 18.5 +/- 6.3% of the duct epithelial cells 
      of sweat gland. In contrast, urine sediment smears revealed that only 3 patients 
      had p62 positive intranuclear inclusions in 3.5 +/- 1.2% of the sedimentary cells. 
      Ultrastructural examinations showed that intranuclear inclusions were also 
      identified in the cell sediment of the 3 patients. CONCLUSION: Urine cytology may 
      be a new and non-invasive pathological diagnosis technique for some NIID 
      patients, although the positive rate is not as high as that of skin biopsy, which 
      is a sensitive and reliable pathological method for NIID.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare 
      neurodegenerative disease characterized clinically by eosinophilic hyaline 
      intranuclear inclusions in neuronal and other somatic cells. Skin biopsies are 
      reportedly useful in diagnosing NIID, and the genetic cause of NIID was 
      identified as a GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC in recent years. The number of 
      adult patients diagnosed via genetic testing has increased; however, there have 
      been no detailed reports of pediatric NIID cases with GGC expansions in 
      NOTCH2NLC. This is the first detailed report of a pediatric patient showing 
      various neurological symptoms from the age of 10 and was ultimately diagnosed 
      with NIID via skin biopsy and triplet repeat primed polymerase chain reaction 
      analyses. CASE REPORT: This was an 18-year-old female who developed cyclic 
      vomiting, distal dominant muscle weakness, and sustained miosis at 10 years. 
      Nerve conduction studies revealed axonal degeneration, and her neuropathy had 
      slowly progressed despite several rounds of high-dose methylprednisolone and 
      intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. At 13 years, she had an acute 
      encephalopathy-like episode. At 15 years, brain MRI revealed slightly 
      high-intensity lesions on diffusion-weighted and T2-weighted imaging in the 
      subcortical white matter of her frontal lobes that expanded over time. At 
      16 years, esophagography, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and esophageal 
      manometry revealed esophageal achalasia, and per-oral endoscopic myotomy was 
      performed. At 18 years, we diagnosed her with NIID based on the findings of skin 
      specimen analyses and a GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC. CONCLUSION: NIID 
      should be considered as a differential diagnosis in pediatric patients with 
      various neurological symptoms.

TI  - Clinical features and reclassification of essential tremor with NOTCH2NLC GGC

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions have been identified to 
      be associated with essential tremor (ET). Our aim was to characterize ET patients 
      with NOTCH2NLC repeat expansions versus non-expansions and describe distinctive 
      clinical features of repeat expanded patients with long-term follow-up according 
      to the new tremor classification. METHODS: Participants included 597 ET 
      pedigrees, 412 sporadic cases and 1085 healthy controls. Repeat expansions of GGC 
      in NOTCH2NLC were screened, and comprehensive clinical features were 
      investigated. A longitudinal clinical assessment and reclassification were 
      performed in NOTCH2NLC expanded patients. RESULTS: In total, 27 ET pedigrees 
      (27/597) and three sporadic patients (3/412) were identified with pathogenic 
      NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions (>/=60 repeats). Intermediate-length GGC repeats 
      (41-59 repeats) were found in four sporadic ET cases and one control subject, and 
      the frequency was higher than that in control participants (4/412 vs. 1/1085, 
      p = 0.022). About 46 ET patients (43 familial cases from 27 pedigrees and three 
      sporadic cases) with NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions had higher Essential Tremor 
      Rating Assessment Scale I, Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale II and 
      Non-Motor Symptoms Scale scores and lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores 
      than the patients without expansions. Patients with pathogenic GGC repeats were 
      reclassified as pure ET (25/46), ET-plus (11/46) and ET-neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusion disease (10/46) subgroups at 2-8 years of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Our 
      results further supported that NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions were associated 
      with ET. Patients with pathogenic GGC repeats presented with more severe motor 
      and non-motor symptoms. Further long-term follow-up and subtype studies will help 
      to define the role of NOTCH2NLC in ET.

AB  - Non-coding repeat expansions within RFC1 and NOTCH2NLC genes have lately been 
      linked to multisystem neurodegenerative diseases, which also shed light on yet 
      undiagnosed patients with inherited peripheral neuropathies. The aim of this 
      study was to identify the genetic basis of patients with hereditary sensory and 
      autonomic neuropathy (HSAN). We collected 79 unrelated DNA samples clinically 
      suspected with HSAN from multiple regions of Japan. Mutation screening was first 
      performed using gene panel sequencing and whole-exome sequencing. 
      Pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were identified from genes of WNK1/HSN2 (6 
      cases), SCN9A (3 cases), NTRK1 (3 cases), and DNMT1 (2 cases). Subsequently, 
      long-range flanking PCR and repeat-primed PCR were applied to analyze repeat 
      expansions in RFC1 and NOTCH2NLC. Bi-allelic RFC1 repeat expansions were detected 
      from 20 adult-onset HSAN patients, consisting of [(AAGGG)exp/(AAGGG)exp] (8 
      cases), [(ACAGG)exp/(ACAGG)exp] (8 cases), and [(AAGGG)exp/(ACAGG)exp] (4 cases). 
      GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC was found in 1 case. Single-nucleotide 
      variant-based haplotype analysis of patients harboring disease-associated repeat 
      expansions in RFC1 revealed distinguishable haplotypes among subgroups with 
      different repeat genotypes. These findings substantially redefine the genetic 
      spectrum of HSAN, where multi-type RFC1 repeat expansions account for 25.3% of 
      all patients, highlighting the necessity of genetic screening, particularly for 
      adult-onset patients.

AB  - We report two patients with autosomal dominant neuronal intranuclear inclusion 
      disease (NIID) harboring the biallelic GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC to 
      uncover the impact of repeat expansion zygosity on the clinical phenotype. The 
      zygosity of the entire NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion and DNA methylation were 
      comprehensively evaluated using fluorescent amplicon length PCR (AL-PCR), 
      Southern blotting and targeted long-read sequencing, and detailed 
      genetic/epigenetic and clinical features were described. In AL-PCR, we could not 
      recognize the wild-type allele in both patients. Targeted long-read sequencing 
      revealed that one patient harbored a homozygous repeat expansion. The other 
      patient harbored compound heterozygous repeat expansions. The GGC repeats and the 
      nearest CpG island were hypomethylated in all expanded alleles in both patients. 
      Both patients harboring the biallelic GGC repeat expansion showed a typical 
      dementia-dominant NIID phenotype. In conclusion, the biallelic GGC repeat 
      expansion in two typical NIID patients indicated that NOTCH2NLC-related diseases 
      could be completely dominant.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the differential diagnoses of 
      diseases that occur in adulthood and lead to progressive generalized muscle 
      weakness. Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a disease in which 
      histopathologically eosinophilic nuclear inclusion bodies are found in various 
      systems. Both familial and sporadic forms of the disease have been reported. Most 
      cases of sporadic NIID are of the dementia type, in which the main symptom is 
      dementia at the first onset. Familial NIID is more diverse, with the main 
      dominant symptoms being muscle weakness (NIID-M), dementia (NIID-D), and 
      parkinsonism (NIID-P). Furthermore, recently, a GGC-repeat expansion in the Notch 
      2 N-terminal like C (NOTCH2NLC) gene, which produces a toxic 
      polyglycine-containing protein (uN2CpolyG) in patients with NIID, has been 
      associated with the pathogenesis of ALS. These results suggest that sporadic 
      NIIDs may have more diverse forms. To date, no autopsy cases of NIID patients 
      with an ALS phenotype have been reported. Here, we describe the first autopsy 
      case report of a patient with sporadic NIID who had been clinically diagnosed 
      with ALS. A 65-year-old Japanese man with no family history of neuromuscular 
      disease developed progressive muscle atrophy and weakness in all limbs. The 
      patient was diagnosed with ALS (El Escoriral diagnostic criteria: probable ALS, 
      laboratory-supported ALS). He had no cognitive dysfunction or neuropathies 
      suggestive of NIID. He required respiratory assistance 48 months after onset. He 
      died of pneumonia at the age of 79 years. Postmortem examinations revealed 
      neuronal loss in the spinal anterior horns and motor cortex. In these affected 
      regions, eosinophilic, round neuronal intranuclear inclusions were evident, which 
      were immunopositive for ubiquitin, p62, and uN2CpolyG. No Bunina bodies or 
      TDP-43-positive inclusions were observed in the brain or spinal cord. Our 
      findings suggest that a small proportion of patients with NIID can manifest a 
      clinical phenotype of ALS. Although skin biopsy is commonly used for the clinical 
      diagnosis of NIID, it may also be useful to identify cases of NIID masquerading 
      as ALS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Facial-onset sensory and motor neuronopathy (FOSMN) syndrome is a 
      rare clinical syndrome in which the etiopathogenesis and disease-causing genes 
      remain unknown. In addition, clinical and molecular pathological studies have 
      rarely been evaluated in a large case series. METHODS: In this study, we present 
      the clinical features and electrodiagnostic findings of the largest cohort of six 
      patients with FOSMN in East Asia to date. Immunofluorescence assessment of TAR 
      DNA-binding protein (TDP)-43 in muscle and skin fibroblasts, detection of GGC 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC gene, and GGGGCC hexanucleotide 
      repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene were also performed. RESULTS: All patients 
      exhibited typical symptoms and signs of FOSMN syndrome. Almost all patients 
      showed a delayed or absent blink reflex. Neurogenic damage was found in five 
      patients by electromyography. Two of the five patients with muscle and skin 
      biopsies showed TDP-43-positive inclusions in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of 
      muscular tissue and skin fibroblasts. There were no repeat expansions in the 
      C9orf72 or NOTCH2NLC genes in any of the six patients. CONCLUSIONS: To date, this 
      is the largest FOSMN cohort in East Asia. TDP-43-positive cytoplasmic inclusions 
      in muscle and skin fibroblasts may be a pathologic feature of the disease. The 
      patient's dynamic mutation test showed no GGC trinucleotide repeat expansions in 
      the NOTCH2NLC and GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene. 
      Further studies are needed with more patients.

TI  - DNA hypermethylation of NOTCH2NLC in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease: a 
      case-control study.
PG  - 6049-6057
LID - 10.1007/s00415-022-11272-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC gene have been recently proposed 
      to cause neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) via prevailing 
      gain-of-function mechanism (protein and RNA toxicity). Nevertheless, increasing 
      evidences suggest that epigenetics can also play a role in the pathogenesis of 
      repeat-mediated disorders. METHODS: In this study, using MethylTarget sequencing, 
      we performed a quantitative analysis of the methylation status of 68 CpG sites 
      located around the NOTCH2NLC promoter in 25 NIID patients and 25 age- and 
      gender-matched healthy controls. We further explored the correlation of DNA 
      methylation (DNAm) status with disease features and performed receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: DNAm levels of GGC repeats and adjacent 
      CpG islands were higher in the NIID patients than in controls, independent of 
      gender and family history. DNAm levels at 4 CpG sites (CpG_207, CpG_421, GpG_473 
      and CpG_523) were negatively correlated with age at onset, and DNAm levels at 7 
      CpG sites (CpG_25, CpG_298, CpG_336, CpG_374, CpG_411, CpG_421 and CpG_473) were 
      positively correlated with GGC repeats. NIID patients had concomitant system 
      symptoms besides nervous system symptoms, and negative correlations between 
      NOTCH2NLC DNAm levels and the number of multi-systemic involvement were observed 
      in the study. The area under the ROC curve at NOTCH2NLC DNAm level reached to 
      0.733 for the best cutoff point of 0.012. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested the 
      aberrant DNAm status of the NOTCH2NLC promoter in NIID, and we explored the link 
      between DNAm levels and disease features quantitatively for the first time, which 
      may help to further explore pathogenic mechanism.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Herein, we report a genetically confirmed case of neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusion disease without characteristic subcortical 
      hyperintensities on diffusion-weighted imaging. CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old 
      man was admitted to our hospital with subacute onset of conscious disturbance. 
      Except for gastric cancer, he had no apparent past medical or family history. He 
      presented with transient fever, vomiting, and urinary retention. On admission, no 
      apparent abnormal intensity was detected on diffusion-weighted imaging. The 
      symptoms improved within 10 days, without any medical treatment. Additional 
      inspections were performed under suspicion of neuronal intranuclear inclusion 
      disease. Intranuclear inclusions were found not only from skin biopsy but also 
      from his stomach specimens, which had been resected 6 years previously. 
      Subsequent genetic testing revealed repeat expansion of GGC amplification in 
      NOTCH2NLC. CONCLUSION: Characteristic neuroimaging and skin biopsy findings are 
      important clues for diagnosing neuronal intranuclear inclusion diseases. 
      Nonetheless, confirming a diagnosis is difficult due to the diversity of clinical 
      manifestations and radiological features. Clinicians should suspect neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusion disease in patients with transient encephalitic episodes, 
      even if no abnormalities are detected on diffusion-weighted imaging.

TI  - NOTCH2NLC-related oculopharyngodistal myopathy type 3 complicated with focal 
      segmental glomerular sclerosis: a case report.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an adult-onset neuromuscular 
      disease characterized by progressive ocular, facial, pharyngeal, and distal limb 
      muscle involvement. Recent research showed that GGC repeat expansions in the 
      NOTCH2NLC gene were observed in a proportion of OPDM patients, and these patients 
      were designated as having OPDM type 3 (OPDM3). Heterogeneous neuromuscular 
      manifestations have been described previously in studies of OPDM3; however, 
      kidney involvement in this disease has rarely been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: 
      Here, we report the case of a 22-year-old Chinese patient with typical 
      manifestations of OPDM complicated with focal segmental glomerular sclerosis 
      (FSGS). This patient with sporadic FSGS exhibited distal motor neuropathy and 
      rimmed vacuolar myopathy in clinical and pathological examinations. An expansion 
      of 122 CGG repeats located in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the NOTCH2NLC 
      gene was identified as the causative mutation in this patient. The clinical and 
      histopathological findings fully met the criteria for the diagnosis of OPDM3. In 
      addition, intranuclear inclusions were detected in the renal tubule epithelial 
      cells of this patient, indicating that the kidney may also be impaired in 
      NOTCH2NLC-related GGC repeat expansion disorders (NREDs). CONCLUSIONS: Our case 
      report demonstrated the clinicopathological cooccurrence of sporadic FSGS and 
      OPDM3 in a patient, which highlighted that the kidney may show inclusion 
      depositions in OPDM3, thus expanding the clinical spectrum of NREDs.

AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized by cognitive impairment, extrapyramidal symptoms, white matter 
      lesions and muscle weakness. The cause of NIID is a repeat amplification of a GGC 
      mutation in the 5 ' untranslated region (UTR) of the NOTCH2NLC gene. Using the 
      non-integrating Sendai virus to deliver the Klf4, OCT3/4, SOX2 and C-MYC factors, 
      fibroblasts obtained from a NIID patient were reprogrammed to generate an induced 
      pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line (ZZUi036-A). Our approach provided a resource 
      for the investigation of the mechanism of the disease, drug research, cell 
      transplantation and gene therapy.

TI  - GGC Repeat Expansion of RILPL1 is Associated with Oculopharyngodistal Myopathy.
PG  - 512-526
LID - 10.1002/ana.26436 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an adult-onset neuromuscular 
      disease characterized by progressive ptosis, dysarthria, ophthalmoplegia, and 
      distal muscle weakness. Recent studies revealed that GGC repeat expansions in 
      5'-UTR of LRP12, GIPC1, and NOTCH2NLC are associated with OPDM. Despite these 
      advances, approximately 30% of OPDM patients remain genetically undiagnosed. 
      Herein, we aim to investigate the genetic basis for undiagnosed OPDM patients in 
      two unrelated Chinese Han families. METHODS: Parametric linkage analysis was 
      performed. Long-read sequencing followed by repeat-primed polymerase chain 
      reaction and amplicon length polymerase chain reaction were used to determine the 
      genetic cause. Targeted methylation sequencing was implemented to detect 
      epigenetic changes. The possible pathogenesis mechanism was investigated by 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, RNA fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization, and immunofluorescence staining of muscle biopsy samples. RESULTS: 
      The disease locus was mapped to 12q24.3. Subsequently, GGC repeat expansion in 
      the promoter region of RILPL1 was identified in six OPDM patients from two 
      families, findings consistent with a founder effect, designated as OPDM type 4. 
      Targeted methylation sequencing revealed hypermethylation at the RILPL1 locus in 
      unaffected individuals with ultralong expansion. Analysis of muscle samples 
      showed no significant differences in RILPL1 mRNA or RILPL1 protein levels between 
      patients and controls. Public CAGE-seq data indicated that alternative 
      transcription start sites exist upstream of the RefSeq-annotated RILPL1 
      transcription start site. Strand-specific RNA-seq data revealed bidirectional 
      transcription from the RILPL1 locus. Finally, fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization/immunofluorescence staining showed that both sense and antisense 
      transcripts formed RNA foci, and were co-localized with hnRNPA2B1 and p62 in the 
      intranuclear inclusions of OPDM type 4 patients. INTERPRETATION: Our findings 
      implicate abnormal GGC repeat expansions in the promoter region of RILPL1 as a 
      novel genetic cause for OPDM, and suggest a methylation mechanism and a potential 
      RNA toxicity mechanism are involved in OPDM type 4 pathogenesis. ANN NEUROL

TI  - Adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy and neuronal intranuclear inclusion 
      disease: lessons from two new Chinese families.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1007/s10072-022-06057-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a rare 
      genetic leukoencephalopathy caused by duplication of the lamin B1 gene (LMNB1) or 
      LMNB1 upstream deletions. Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is 
      another leukoencephalopathy due to GGC repeat expansion in the 5'-untranslated 
      region of the NOTCH2NLC gene. Here, we report two Chinese ADLD families with 
      neuroimaging and clinical features mimicking NIID. METHODS: We conducted detailed 
      medical history inquiry, neurological examinations, and magnetic resonance 
      imaging in the two families. Candidate gene sequencing and whole exome sequencing 
      (WES) with copy number variation analysis were used to screen the genetic 
      variations. The special points on the clinical and neuroimaging findings in the 
      current families and differential diagnosis of ADLD with NIID are discussed. 
      RESULTS: The two families presented with slowly progressive, multiple central 
      nervous system symptoms, including spastic paraplegia, autonomic dysfunction, 
      ataxia, deep sensory loss, and tremor. Clinical phenotypes were consistent within 
      the family. Transient hypoglycemia and transient dilated pupils indicating 
      autonomic dysfunctions were recorded for the first time in ADLD. Brain MRI showed 
      band-like hyperintensities at the cortico-medullary junction on DWI, typical for 
      NIID. Skin biopsy and genetic sequencing of the NOTCH2NCL gene did not support 
      the diagnosis of NIID. Further whole exome sequencing (WES) identified the 
      duplication mutation spanning the entire LMNB1 gene. CONCLUSIONS: The novel 
      feature of transient hypoglycemia and dilated pupils broadens the spectrum of 
      autonomic dysfunction in ADLD. Clinical manifestations and neuroimaging of ADLD 
      can mimic NIID. Although ADLD is even rarer than NIID, the differential diagnosis 
      of these two diseases should not be confused.

AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID), caused by an expansion of GGC 
      repeats in the 5'-untranslated region of NOTCH2NLC, is an important but 
      underdiagnosed cause of adult-onset leukoencephalopathies. The present study 
      aimed to investigate the prevalence, clinical spectrum and brain MRI 
      characteristics of NIID in adult-onset nonvascular leukoencephalopathies and 
      assess the diagnostic performance of neuroimaging features. One hundred and 
      sixty-one unrelated Taiwanese patients with genetically undetermined nonvascular 
      leukoencephalopathies were screened for the NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions using 
      fragment analysis, repeat-primed PCR, Southern blot analysis and/or nanopore 
      sequencing with Cas9-mediated enrichment. Among them, 32 (19.9%) patients had an 
      expanded NOTCH2NLC allele and were diagnosed with NIID. We enrolled another two 
      affected family members from one patient for further analysis. The size of the 
      expanded NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats in the 34 patients ranged from 73 to 323 repeats. 
      Skin biopsies from five patients all showed eosinophilic, p62-positive 
      intranuclear inclusions in the sweat gland cells and dermal adipocytes. Among the 
      34 NIID patients presenting with nonvascular leukoencephalopathies, the median 
      age at symptom onset was 61 years (range, 41-78 years) and the initial 
      presentations included cognitive decline (44.1%; 15/34), acute encephalitis-like 
      episodes (32.4%; 11/34), limb weakness (11.8%; 4/34) and parkinsonism (11.8%; 
      4/34). Cognitive decline (64.7%; 22/34) and acute encephalitis-like episodes 
      (55.9%; 19/34) were also the most common overall manifestations. Two-thirds of 
      the patients had either bladder dysfunction or visual disturbance. Comparing the 
      brain MRI features between the NIID patients and individuals with other 
      undetermined leukoencephalopathies, corticomedullary junction curvilinear lesions 
      on diffusion weighted images were the best biomarkers for diagnosing NIID with 
      high specificity (98.4%) and sensitivity (88.2%). However, this diffusion 
      weighted imaging abnormality was absent in 11.8% of the NIID patients. When only 
      fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images were available, the presence of white 
      matter hyperintensity lesions either in the paravermis or middle cerebellar 
      peduncles also favoured the diagnosis of NIID with a specificity of 85.3% and 
      sensitivity of 76.5%. Among the MRI scans of 10 patients, performed within 5 days 
      of the onset of acute encephalitis-like episodes, five showed cortical 
      hyperintense lesions on diffusion weighted images and two revealed focal brain 
      oedema. In conclusion, NIID accounts for 19.9% (32/161) of patients with 
      adult-onset genetically undiagnosed nonvascular leukoencephalopathies in Taiwan. 
      Half of the NIID patients developed encephalitis-like episodes with restricted 
      diffusion in the cortical regions on diffusion weighted images at the acute 
      stage. Corticomedullary junction hyperintense lesions, white matter 
      hyperintensities in the paravermis or middle cerebellar peduncles, bladder 
      dysfunction and visual disturbance are useful hints to diagnosing NIID.

TI  - GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC causing a phenotype of lower motor neuron 
      syndrome.
PG  - 4469-4477
LID - 10.1007/s00415-022-11092-0 [doi]
AB  - A genetic diagnosis cannot be made in a considerable proportion of patients with 
      hereditary lower motor neuron (LMN) syndromes. The GGC repeat expansion in the 
      5'untranslated region (5'UTR) of NOTCH2NLC gene has been reported to be 
      associated with a group of NOTCH2NLC-related repeat expansion disorders (NRED), 
      including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The relationship between the 
      mutation and LMN syndromes has not been reported previously. Here, we identified 
      the GGC repeat expansions of NOTCH2NLC in a Chinese familial patient with LMN 
      syndrome, presenting with slowly progressive weakness of four limbs. Needle 
      electromyography revealed evidence of acute denervation and chronic neurogenic 
      changes. Cognition and brain MRI were normal. Initial whole-exome sequencing by 
      next generation sequencing revealed negative results. However, repeat-primed 
      polymerase chain reaction performed on the proband showed a pathogenic GGC 
      expansion in the 5'UTR of NOTCH2NLC and long-read sequencing subsequently 
      revealed 248 GGC repeats. The mutation was co-segregated with the clinical 
      phenotype in the family. Immunofluorescent studies identified p62-positive 
      protein deposits in the intranuclear inclusions in myofibers. The GGC repeat 
      expansion in NOTCH2NLC is associated with a new phenotype of hereditary LMN 
      syndrome. As a result, NOTCH2NLC genotyping should be performed in patients with 
      hereditary LMN syndromes.

TI  - Oculopharyngodistal myopathy with CGG repeat expansions in GIPC1: the first 
      report from southwestern China.

AB  - Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is a rare adult-onset hereditary muscular 
      disease characterized by slowly progressive ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia and 
      weakness of the facial, pharyngeal and distal limb muscles. Recently, CGG repeat 
      expansion mutations in three genes, LRP12, GIPC1 and NOTCH2NLC, have been 
      identified as causative factors for OPDM. Here, we report clinicopathologically 
      typical familial OPDM patients from southwestern China. CGG repeat expansions in 
      GIPC1 were detected in two OPDM-affected individuals. Our study was the first 
      GIPC1-OPDM report from southwestern China, further confirming expanded GGC 
      repeats in GIPC1 as the cause of OPDM.

TI  - Genetic spectrum in a cohort of patients with distal hereditary motor neuropathy.
PG  - 633-643
LID - 10.1002/acn3.51543 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) is a heterogeneous group of 
      diseases characterized by exclusive degeneration of peripheral motor nerves, 
      while only 20.0-47.8% of dHMN patients are genetically identified. Recently, GGC 
      expansion in the 5'UTR of NOTCH2NLC has been associated with dHMN. Accordingly, 
      short tandem repeat (STR) should be further explored in genetically unsolved 
      patients with dHMN. METHODS: A total of 128 patients from 90 unrelated families 
      were clinically diagnosed as dHMN, and underwent a comprehensively genetic 
      screening. Skin biopsies were conducted with routine protocols. RESULTS: Most 
      patients showed chronic distal weakness of lower limbs (121/128), while 20 
      patients initially had asymmetrical involvements, 14 had subclinical sensory 
      abnormalities, 11 had pyramidal impairments, five had cerebellar disturbance, and 
      four had hyperCKmia. The rate of genetic detection was achieved in 36.7% (33/90), 
      and the rate increased to 46.7% (42/90) if patients with variants uncertain 
      significance were included. The most common causative genes included 
      chaperone-related genes (8/33, 24.2%), tRNA synthetase genes (4/33, 12.1%), and 
      cytoskeleton-related genes (4/33, 12.1%). Additionally, two dominant inherited 
      families were attributed to abnormal expansion of GGC repeats in the 5'UTR of 
      NOTCH2NLC; and a patient with dHMN and cerebellar symptoms had CAG repeat 
      expansion in the ATXN2 gene. Skin biopsy from patients with GGC expansion in 
      NOTCH2NLC revealed typical intranuclear inclusions on histological and 
      ultrastructural examinations. INTERPRETATIONS: This study further extends the 
      genetic heterogeneity of dHMN. Given some dHMN patients may be associated with 
      nucleotides repeat expansion, STR screening is necessary to perform in 
      genetically unsolved patients.

AB  - We investigated 98 Taiwanese patients with molecularly unassigned hereditary 
      spastic paraplegia (HSP) and found none of them had the NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat 
      expansion, which is the cause of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). 
      Our findings suggest that the NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion may not contribute 
      to HSP.

TI  - GIPC1 CGG Repeat Expansion Is Associated with Movement Disorders.
PG  - 704-715
LID - 10.1002/ana.26325 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: CGG/GGC repeat expansion in FMR1 and NOTCH2NLC is reportedly 
      associated with movement disorders; therefore, we hypothesized that the CGG 
      repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1, which was previously identified 
      in myopathy, might also be associated with movement-disorder phenotypes. Here, we 
      investigated whether CGG repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1 
      presents in a cohort of patients with movement disorders. METHODS: We screened 
      for the CGG repeat expansion in LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1, and GIPC1 in 1,346 
      movement-disorder patients and 1,451 matched healthy controls. RESULTS: No 
      patients or controls harbored expanded CGG repeats in LRP12 or NUTM2B-AS1, 
      whereas 16 patients harbored >40 CGG repeats in GIPC1, with 11 of these patients 
      harboring >60 CGG repeats. One control individual harbored an expanded GIPC1 
      allele (83 CGG units), suggesting that approximately 1% of patients affected by 
      movement disorders in our population might harbor GIPC1 CGG repeat expansion, 
      with this likely extremely rare in healthy controls (<0.001). The clinical 
      phenotypes of the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive patients strongly resembled those in 
      patients displaying NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat-positive movement disorders. 
      Additionally, the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive patients presented white-matter 
      hyperintensities but without typical NOTCH2NLC-related high-intensity signals in 
      the corticomedullary junction. Furthermore, 44% of the GIPC1 CGG repeat-positive 
      patients showed a cognitive deficit, and skin biopsies in 2 patients revealed 
      deposition of intranuclear inclusions. INTERPRETATION: The CGG repeat expansion 
      in GIPC1 might be associated with movement-disorder phenotypes and lead to 
      diseases related to intranuclear inclusions. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:704-715.

AB  - Recent studies indicate that CGG repeat expansions in LRP12, GIPC1, and NOTCH2NLC 
      are associated with oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) types 1, 2, and 3, 
      respectively. However, some clinicopathologically confirmed OPDM cases continue 
      to have unknown genetic causes. Here, through a combination of long-read 
      whole-genome sequencing (LRS), repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR), 
      and fluorescence amplicon length analysis PCR (AL-PCR), we found that a CGG 
      repeat expansion in the 5' UTR of RILPL1 is associated with familial and simplex 
      OPDM type 4 (OPDM4). The number of repeats ranged from 139 to 197. Methylation 
      analysis indicates that the methylation levels in RILPL1 were unaltered in OPDM4 
      individuals. Analyses of muscle biopsies suggested that the expanded CGG repeat 
      might be translated into a toxic poly-glycine protein that co-localizes with p62 
      in intranuclear inclusions. Moreover, analyses suggest that the toxic RNA 
      gain-of-function effects also contributed to the pathogenesis of this disease. 
      Intriguingly, all four types of OPDM have been found to be associated with the 
      CGG repeat expansions located in 5' UTRs. This finding suggests that a common 
      pathogenic mechanism, driven by the CGG repeat expansion, might underlie all 
      cases of OPDM.

TI  - The role of NOTCH2NLC in Parkinson's disease: A clinical, neuroimaging, and 
      pathological study.
PG  - 1610-1618
LID - 10.1111/ene.15283 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently, the pathogenic and intermediate GGC repeat 
      expansion in NOTCH2NLC was detected in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, 
      detailed clinical, neuroimaging, and pathological information of clinically 
      diagnosed PD patients with pathogenic GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC remains 
      scarce. Thus, we aimed to elucidate the clinical, neuroimaging, and pathological 
      characteristics of PD patients carrying the pathogenic GGC repeat expansion in 
      NOTCH2NLC. METHODS: The NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion was screened in 941 
      sporadic PD patients and 244 unrelated probands. Comprehensive assessments were 
      performed in three PD patients with pathogenic GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC. 
      The repeat expansion length was estimated using CRISPR/Cas9-based targeted 
      long-read sequencing. RESULTS: The three patients (two PD patients from Family 1 
      and one sporadic PD) carrying the pathogenic NOTCH2NLC expansion were reconfirmed 
      with a diagnosis of clinically established PD. Although they lacked the typical 
      neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
      feature, the typical PD pattern of striatal dopamine transporter loss was 
      detected. Notably, all three patients presented with systemic areflexia, and 
      other secondary causes of polyneuropathy were excluded. Skin biopsy showed 
      intranuclear inclusions and an absence of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein 
      deposition in the skin nerve fibers of all three patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      these clinically diagnosed PD patients with pathogenic GGC repeat expansion in 
      NOTCH2NLC were hardly distinguishable from idiopathic PD based on clinical course 
      and neuroimaging features, the pathological findings indicated that their 
      phenotype was a PD phenocopy of NIID. Systemic areflexia may be an important and 
      unique clinical clue suggesting further genetic testing and skin biopsy 
      examination to confirm the diagnosis of NIID in patients presenting with a PD 
      phenocopy.

TI  - Intranuclear inclusions in skin biopsies are not limited to neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusion disease but can also be seen in oculopharyngodistal myopathy.
PG  - e12787
LID - 10.1111/nan.12787 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is caused by the expansion of CGG 
      repeats in NOTCH2NLC (OPDM_NOTCH2NLC) GIPC1 (OPDM_GIPC1), or LRP12 (OPDM_LRP12). 
      Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is clinically distinct from OPDM 
      but is also caused by the expansion of CGG repeats in NOTCH2NLC, which may be an 
      indicator of intranuclear inclusion in skin biopsy. We investigated the presence 
      of intranuclear inclusions in skin biopsies from patients with OPDM and muscle 
      diseases with a similar pathology to evaluate whether they will have similar 
      diagnostic findings on skin biopsy. METHODS: We analysed the frequency of 
      p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in sweat gland cells, adipocytes and 
      fibroblasts in skin biopsy samples from patients with OPDM (OPDM_NOTCH2NLC 
      [n = 2], OPDM_GIPC1 [n = 6] and OPDM_LRP12 [n = 3]), NIID (n = 1), OPMD (n = 1), 
      IBM (n = 4) and GNE myopathy (n = 2). RESULTS: The p62-postive intranuclear 
      inclusions were observed in all three cell types in both patients with 
      OPDM_NOTCH2NLC and a patient with NIID, in at least one cell type in all six 
      patients with OPDM_GIPC1, and all in three cell types in one of the three 
      patients with OPDM_LRP12. These findings were not observed in patients with OPMD, 
      IBM or GNE myopathy. CONCLUSION: Intranuclear inclusions in skin biopsy samples 
      are not specific to NIID and are found in all three types of genetically 
      confirmed OPDM, suggesting that the underlying mechanism of OPDM may be similar 
      to NIID, regardless of causative genes.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the ocular characteristics of neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID), caused by GGC repeat expansion in the 
      NOTCH2NLC gene, combined with the systemic clinical manifestations, and propose 
      early diagnostic features of NIID. METHODS: Six patients (12 eyes) were enrolled 
      in this study. In vivo corneal confocal microscopy (IVCCM), fundus photography, 
      fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging, optical coherence tomography (OCT), 
      full-field electroretinography (ERG), and electromyography were performed. 
      RESULTS: The average corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD) was 6.83 +/- 4.96 
      number/mm(2), and the corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL) was 6.76 +/- 1.96 mm/mm(2). 
      The nerves were looser and more curved in affected individuals. Dendritic cells 
      were observed in patients with NIID. Chorioretinal atrophy, hyper-AF spots, and 
      outer retinal abnormalities were observed during FAF imaging and OCT 
      examinations. In full-field ERGs, the amplitudes of the a-wave and b-wave reduced 
      or extinguished over time. The compound muscle action potential and motor nerve 
      conduction velocity of the left common peroneal nerve decreased substantially. 
      CONCLUSION: The findings of IVCCM and retinal changes should be included in the 
      diagnostic criteria for NIID. Corneal confocal characteristics may precede the 
      systemic neurological manifestations and provide a clinical basis for the early 
      treatment and staging of the disease. ClincalTrials.gov. Identifier:

TI  - Father-to-offspring transmission of extremely long NOTCH2NLC repeat expansions 
      with contractions: genetic and epigenetic profiling with long-read sequencing.
PG  - 204
LID - 10.1186/s13148-021-01192-5 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC are associated with neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusion disease. Very recently, asymptomatic carriers with 
      NOTCH2NLC repeat expansions were reported. In these asymptomatic individuals, the 
      CpG island in NOTCH2NLC is hypermethylated, suggesting that two factors repeat 
      length and DNA methylation status should be considered to evaluate pathogenicity. 
      Long-read sequencing can be used to simultaneously profile genomic and epigenomic 
      alterations. We analyzed four sporadic cases with NOTCH2NLC repeat expansion and 
      their phenotypically normal parents. The native genomic DNA that retains base 
      modification was sequenced on a per-trio basis using both PacBio and Oxford 
      Nanopore long-read sequencing technologies. A custom workflow was developed to 
      evaluate DNA modifications. With these two technologies combined, long-range DNA 
      methylation information was integrated with complete repeat DNA sequences to 
      investigate the genetic origins of expanded GGC repeats in these sporadic cases. 
      RESULTS: In all four families, asymptomatic fathers had longer expansions 
      (median: 522, 390, 528 and 650 repeats) compared with their affected offspring 
      (median: 93, 117, 162 and 140 repeats, respectively). These expansions are much 
      longer than the disease-causing range previously reported (in general, 41-300 
      repeats). Repeat lengths were extremely variable in the father, suggesting 
      somatic mosaicism. Instability is more frequent in alleles with uninterrupted 
      pure GGCs. Single molecule epigenetic analysis revealed complex DNA methylation 
      patterns and epigenetic heterogeneity. We identified an aberrant 
      gain-of-methylation region (2.2 kb in size beyond the CpG island and GGC repeats) 
      in asymptomatic fathers. This methylated region was unmethylated in the normal 
      allele with bilateral transitional zones with both methylated and unmethylated 
      CpG dinucleotides, which may be protected from methylation to ensure NOTCH2NLC 
      expression. CONCLUSIONS: We clearly demonstrate that the four sporadic 
      NOTCH2NLC-related cases are derived from the paternal GGC repeat contraction 
      associated with demethylation. The entire genetic and epigenetic landscape of the 
      NOTCH2NLC region was uncovered using the custom workflow of long-read sequence 
      data, demonstrating the utility of this method for revealing 
      epigenetic/mutational changes in repetitive elements, which are difficult to 
      characterize by conventional short-read/bisulfite sequencing methods. Our 
      approach should be useful for biomedical research, aiding the discovery of DNA 
      methylation abnormalities through the entire genome.

TI  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease tremor-dominant subtype: A mimicker of 
      essential tremor.
PG  - 450-458
LID - 10.1111/ene.15169 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The GGC repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene has been 
      identified as the genetic cause of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease 
      (NIID). Recently, this repeat expansion was also reported to be associated with 
      essential tremor (ET). However, some patients with this repeat expansion, 
      initially diagnosed with ET, were eventually diagnosed with NIID. Therefore, 
      controversy remains regarding the clinical diagnosis of these expansion-positive 
      patients presenting with tremor-dominant symptoms. This study aimed to clarify 
      the clinical phenotype in tremor-dominant patients who have the GGC repeat 
      expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene. METHODS: We screened for pathogenic GGC repeat 
      expansions in 602 patients initially diagnosed with ET and systematically 
      re-evaluated the clinical features of the expansion-positive probands and their 
      family members. RESULTS: Pathogenic GGC repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene 
      was detected in 10 probands (1.66%). Seven of these probands were re-evaluated 
      and found to have systemic areflexia, cognitive impairment, and abnormal nerve 
      conduction, which prompted a change of diagnosis from ET to NIID. Three of the 
      probands had typical hyperintensity in the corticomedullary junction on 
      diffusion-weighted imaging. Intranuclear inclusions were detected in all four 
      probands who underwent skin biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: The NIID tremor-dominant subtype 
      can be easily misdiagnosed as ET. We should take NIID into account for 
      differential diagnosis of ET. Systemic areflexia could be an important clinical 
      clue suggesting that cranial magnetic resonance imaging examination, or even 
      further genetic testing and skin biopsy examination, should be used to confirm 
      the diagnosis of NIID.

AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized by widespread inclusions. Despite the identification of GGC repeat 
      expansion in 5'UTR of NOTCH2NLC gene in adult-onset NIIDs, its pathogenic 
      mechanism remains unclear. Gain-of-function poly-amino-acid proteins generated by 
      unconventional translation have been revealed in nucleotide repeat expansion 
      disorders, inspiring us to explore the possibility of unconventional translation 
      in NIID. Here we demonstrated that NOTCH2NLC 5'UTR triggers the translation of a 
      polyglycine (polyG)-containing protein, N2NLCpolyG. N2NLCpolyG accumulates in 
      p62-positive inclusions in cultured cells, mouse models, and NIID patient tissues 
      with NOTCH2NLC GGC expansion. Translation of N2NLCpolyG is initiated by an 
      upstream open reading frame (uORF) embedding the GGC repeats. N2NLCpolyG tends to 
      aggregate with the increase of GGC repeat units, and displays phase separation 
      properties. N2NLCpolyG aggregation impairs nuclear lamina and nucleocytoplasmic 
      transport but does not necessarily cause acute death on neuronal cells. Our study 
      suggests a similarity of pathogenic mechanisms between NIID and another 
      GGC-repeat disease, fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome. These findings 
      expand our knowledge of protein gain-of-function in NIID, and further highlight 
      evidence for a novel spectrum of diseases caused by aberrant polyG protein 
      aggregation, namely the polyG diseases.

TI  - GGC Repeat Expansion of NOTCH2NLC in Taiwanese Patients With Inherited 
      Neuropathies.
PG  - e199-e206
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000013008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The GGC repeat expansion in the 5' untranslated region 
      of NOTCH2NLC was recently identified as the cause of neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusion disease (NIID), which may manifest with peripheral neuropathy. The aim 
      of this study is to investigate its contribution to inherited neuropathy. 
      METHODS: This cohort study screened patients with molecularly undiagnosed 
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and healthy controls for the GGC repeat 
      expansion in NOTCH2NLC using repeat-primed PCR and fragment analysis. The 
      clinical and electrophysiologic features of the patients harboring the GGC repeat 
      expansion were scrutinized. Skin biopsy with immunohistochemistry staining and 
      electric microscopic imaging were performed. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-seven 
      unrelated patients with CMT, including 66 cases with axonal CMT (CMT2), and 200 
      healthy controls were included. Among them, 7 patients with CMT carried a variant 
      NOTCH2NLC allele with GGC repeat expansion, but it was absent in controls. The 
      sizes of the expanded GGC repeats ranged from 80 to 104 repeats. All 7 patients 
      developed sensory predominant neuropathy with an average age at disease onset of 
      37.1 years (range 21-55 years). Electrophysiologic studies revealed mild axonal 
      sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Leukoencephalopathy was absent in the 5 patients who 
      received a brain MRI. Skin biopsy from 2 patients showed eosinophilic, ubiquitin- 
      and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in the sweat gland cells and dermal 
      fibroblasts. Two of the 7 patients had a family history of NIID. DISCUSSION: The 
      NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions are an underdiagnosed and important cause of 
      inherited neuropathy. The expansion accounts for 10.6% (7 of 66) of molecularly 
      unassigned CMT2 cases in the Taiwanese CMT cohort. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: 
      This study provides Class III evidence that in Taiwanese patients with 
      genetically undiagnosed CMT, 10.6% of the CMT2 cases have the GGC repeat 
      expansion in NOTCH2NLC.

TI  - FXTAS is difficult to differentiate from neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease 
      through skin biopsy: a case report.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Both fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and 
      late-onset neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) show CGG/GGC 
      trinucleotide repeat expansions. Differentiating these diseases are difficult 
      because of the similarity in their clinical and radiological features. It is 
      unclear that skin biopsy can distinguish NIID from FXTAS. We performed a skin 
      biopsy in an FXTAS case with cognitive dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy 
      without tremor, which was initially suspected to be NIID. CASE PRESENTATION: The 
      patient underwent neurological assessment and examinations, including laboratory 
      tests, electrophysiologic test, imaging, skin biopsy, and genetic test. A brain 
      MRI showed hyperintensity lesions along the corticomedullary junction on 
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in addition to middle cerebellar peduncle sign 
      (MCP sign). We suspected NIID from the clinical picture and the radiological 
      findings, and performed a skin biopsy. The skin biopsy specimen showed ubiquitin- 
      and p62-positive intranuclear inclusions, suggesting NIID. However, a genetic 
      analysis for NIID using repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR) revealed 
      no expansion detected in the Notch 2 N-terminal like C (NOTCH2NLC) gene. We then 
      performed genetic analysis for FXTAS using RP-PCR, which revealed a repeat 
      CGG/GGC expansion in the FMRP translational regulator 1 (FMR1) gene. The number 
      of repeats was 83. We finally diagnosed the patient with FXTAS rather than NIID. 
      CONCLUSIONS: For the differential diagnosis of FXTAS and NIID, a skin biopsy 
      alone is insufficient; instead, genetic analysis, is essential. Further 
      investigations in additional cases based on genetic analysis are needed to 
      elucidate the clinical and pathological differences between FXTAS and NIID.

AB  - The GGC repeat expansion in the 5'-untranslated region of NOTCH2NLC was recently 
      identified as the cause of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). To 
      determine if the NIID repeat expansion contributes to amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS), we screened 304 unrelated ALS patients and 637 healthy controls 
      for the GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC using repeat-primed PCR and fragment 
      analysis. None of the ALS patients carried the GGC repeat expansion. The sizes of 
      the GGC repeats ranged from 7 to 36 in the ALS patients and 4 to 46 in the 
      controls. The distribution of the GGC repeat sizes did not differ between the two 
      groups. Our findings indicate that the NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansion is absent 
      or extremely rare in Taiwanese patients with ALS.

AB  - There is still a considerable proportion of patients with inherited peripheral 
      neuropathy (IPN) whose pathogenic genes are unknown. This study was intended to 
      investigate whether the GGC repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC is presented in 
      some patients with IPN. A total of 142 unrelated mainland Chinese patients with 
      highly suspected diagnosis of IPN without any known causative gene were 
      recruited. Repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction (RP-PCR) was performed to 
      screen GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC, followed by fluorescence amplicon 
      length analysis-PCR (AL-PCR) to determine the GGC repeat size. Detailed clinical 
      data as well as nerve, muscle, and skin biopsy were reviewed and analyzed in the 
      NOTCH2NLC-related IPN patients. In total, five of the 142 patients (3.52%) were 
      found to have pathogenic GGC expansion in NOTCH2NLC, with repeat size ranging 
      from 126 to 206 repeats. All the NOTCH2NLC-related IPN patients presented with 
      adult-onset motor-sensory and autonomic neuropathy that predominantly affected 
      the motor component of peripheral nerves. While tremor and irritating dry cough 
      were noted in four-fifths of the patients, no other signs of the central nervous 
      system were presented. Electrophysiological studies revealed both demyelinating 
      and axonal changes of polyneuropathy that were more severe in lower limbs and 
      asymmetrically in upper limbs. Sural nerve pathology was characterized by 
      multiple fibers with thin myelination, indicating a predominant demyelinating 
      process. Muscle pathology was consistent with neuropathic changes. P62-positive 
      intranuclear inclusions were observed in nerve, skin, and muscle tissues. Our 
      study has demonstrated that GGC expansion in NOTCH2NLC is associated with IPN 
      presenting as predominant motor-sensory and autonomic neuropathy, which expands 
      the phenotype of the NOTCH2NLC-related repeat expansion spectrum. Screening of 
      GGC repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC should be considered in patients 
      presenting with peripheral neuropathy with tremor and irritating dry cough.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare 
      neurodegenerative disease. Pathologically, it is characterized by eosinophilic 
      hyaline intranuclear inclusions in the cells of the visceral organs as well as 
      central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous system cells. Recently, a GGC repeat 
      expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene has been identified as the etiopathological agent 
      of NIID. Interestingly, this GGC repeat expansion was also reported in some 
      patients with a clinical diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 
      However, there are no autopsy-confirmed cases of concurrent NIID and ALS. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old Taiwanese woman reported a four-month history of 
      progressive weakness beginning in the right foot that spread to all four 
      extremities. She was diagnosed with ALS because she met the revised El Escorial 
      diagnostic criteria for definite ALS with upper and lower motor neuron 
      involvement in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral regions. She died of 
      respiratory failure at 22 months from ALS onset, at the age of 62 years. Brain 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed lesions in the medial part of the 
      cerebellar hemisphere, right beside the vermis (paravermal lesions). The 
      subclinical neuropathy, indicated by a nerve conduction study (NCS), prompted a 
      potential diagnosis of NIID. Antemortem skin biopsy and autopsy confirmed the 
      coexistence of pathology consistent with both ALS and NIID. We observed neither 
      eccentric distribution of p62-positive intranuclear inclusions in the areas with 
      abundant large motor neurons nor cytopathological coexistence of ALS and NIID 
      pathology in motor neurons. This finding suggested that ALS and NIID developed 
      independently in this patient. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a case of concurrent NIID 
      and ALS discovered during an autopsy. Abnormal brain MRI findings, including 
      paravermal lesions, could indicate the coexistence of NIID even in patients with 
      ALS showing characteristic clinical phenotypes.

AB  - Non-coding repeat expansions, such as CGG, GGC, CUG, CCUG, and GGGGCC, have been 
      shown to be involved in many human diseases, particularly neurological disorders. 
      Of the diverse pathogenic mechanisms proposed in these neurodegenerative 
      diseases, dysregulated RNA metabolism has emerged as an important contributor. 
      Expanded repeat RNAs that form particular structures aggregate to form RNA foci, 
      sequestering various RNA binding proteins and consequently altering RNA splicing, 
      transport, and other downstream biological processes. One of these repeat 
      expansion-associated diseases, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome 
      (FXTAS), is caused by a CGG repeat expansion in the 5'UTR region of the fragile X 
      mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Moreover, recent studies have revealed abnormal 
      GGC repeat expansion within the 5'UTR region of the NOTCH2NLC gene in both 
      essential tremor (ET) and neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). These 
      CGG repeat expansion-associated diseases share genetic, pathological, and 
      clinical features. Identification of the similarities at the molecular level 
      could lead to a better understanding of the disease mechanisms as well as 
      developing novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we highlight our current 
      understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of CGG repeat expansion-associated 
      diseases and discuss potential therapeutic interventions for these neurological 
      disorders.

AB  - The clinical manifestations of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) are 
      heterogeneous, and the premortem diagnosis is mainly based on skin biopsy 
      findings. Abnormal GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC was recently identified in 
      familial and sporadic NIID. The comparison of diagnostic value between abnormal 
      GGC repeat expansions of NOTCH2NLC and skin biopsy has not been conducted yet. In 
      this study, skin biopsy was performed in 10 suspected adult NIID patients with 
      clinical and imaging manifestations, and GGC repeat size in NOTCH2NLC was also 
      screened by repeat primed-PCR and GC-rich PCR. We found that five cases had 
      ubiquitin-immunolabelling intranuclear inclusion bodies by skin biopsy, and all 
      of them were identified with abnormal GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC, among 
      whom four patients showed typical linear hyperintensity at corticomedullary 
      junction on DWI. Five (5/10) NIID patients were diagnosed by combination of 
      NOTCH2NLC gene detection, skin biopsy or combination of NOTCH2NLC, and typical 
      MRI findings. The diagnostic performance of NOTCH2NLC gene detection was highly 
      consistent with that of skin biopsy (Kappa = 1). The unexplained headache was 
      firstly reported as a new early phenotype of NIID. These findings indicate that 
      NOTCH2NLC gene detection is needed to be a supplement in the diagnose flow of 
      NIID and also may be used as an alternative method to skin biopsy especially in 
      Asian population.

TI  - GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC causing a phenotype of distal motor neuropathy 
      and myopathy.
PG  - 1330-1342
LID - 10.1002/acn3.51371 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The expansion of GGC repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the 
      NOTCH2NLC has been associated with various neurogenerative disorders of the 
      central nervous system and, more recently, oculopharyngodistal myopathy. This 
      study aimed to report patients with distal weakness with both neuropathic and 
      myopathic features on electrophysiology and pathology who present GGC repeat 
      expansions in the NOTCH2NLC. METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and long-read 
      sequencing were implemented to identify the candidate genes. In addition, the 
      available clinical data and the pathological changes associated with peripheral 
      nerve and muscle biopsies were reviewed and studied. RESULTS: We identified and 
      validated GGC repeat expansions of NOTCH2NLC in three unrelated patients who 
      presented with progressive weakness predominantly affecting distal lower limb 
      muscles, following negative results in an initial WES. We found intranuclear 
      inclusions with multiple proteins deposits in the nuclei of both myofibers and 
      Schwann cells. The clinical features of these patients are compatible with the 
      diagnosis of distal motor neuropathy and rimmed vacuolar myopathy. 
      INTERPRETATION: These phenotypes enrich the class of features associated with 
      NOTCH2NLC-related repeat expansion disorders (NRED), and provide further evidence 
      that the neurological symptoms of NRED include not only brain, spinal cord, and 
      peripheral nerves damage, but also myopathy, and that overlapping symptoms might 
      exist.

AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized by the presence of intranuclear inclusions of unknown origin. NIID 
      is caused by an expansion of GGC repeats in the 5' UTR of the NOTCH2NLC (N2C) 
      gene. We found that these repeats are embedded in a small upstream open reading 
      frame (uORF) (uN2C), resulting in their translation into a polyglycine-containing 
      protein, uN2CpolyG. This protein accumulates in intranuclear inclusions in cell 
      and mouse models and in tissue samples of individuals with NIID. Furthermore, 
      expression of uN2CpolyG in mice leads to locomotor alterations, neuronal cell 
      loss, and premature death of the animals. These results suggest that translation 
      of expanded GGC repeats into a novel and pathogenic polyglycine-containing 
      protein underlies the presence of intranuclear inclusions and neurodegeneration 
      in NIID.

TI  - Genetic origin of sporadic cases and RNA toxicity in neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusion disease.
PG  - 462-469
LID - 10.1136/jmedgenet-2020-107649 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC has been recently linked to 
      neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) via unknown disease mechanisms. 
      Herein, we explore the genetic origin of the sporadic cases and toxic RNA 
      gain-of-function mechanism in NIID. METHODS: Multiple genetic screenings were 
      performed on NIID individuals and their available family members. Methylation 
      status of blood DNA, NOTCH2NLC mRNA level from muscle biopsies and RNA foci from 
      skin biopsies of NIID individuals or asymptomatic carriers were evaluated and 
      compared. RESULTS: In two sporadic NIID families, we identified two clinically 
      and pathologically asymptomatic fathers carrying large GGC repeat expansion, 
      above 300 repeats, with offspring repeat numbers of 172 and 148, respectively. 
      Further evaluation revealed that the GGC repeat numbers in the sperm from two 
      asymptomatic fathers were only 63 and 98, respectively. The CpG island in 
      NOTCH2NLC of the asymptomatic carriers was hypermethylated, and accordingly, the 
      NOTCH2NLC mRNA levels were decreased in the asymptomatic fathers. GGC repeat 
      expansion RNA formed RNA foci and sequestered RNA binding proteins into p62 
      positive intranuclear inclusions in NIID individuals but not in the control or 
      asymptomatic carrier. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested the GGC repeat expansion in 
      NOTCH2NLC might have a disease-causing number ranging from ~41 to ~300 repeats. 
      The contraction of GGC repeat expansion in sperm could be a possible mechanism 
      for the paternal-biased origin in some sporadic or recessive inherited NIID 
      individuals. The toxic RNA gain-of-function mechanism was identified to be 
      involved in the pathogenicity of this disease.

TI  - The GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC is associated with oculopharyngodistal 
      myopathy type 3.
PG  - 1819-1832

AB  - Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is an adult-onset neuromuscular disease 
      characterized by progressive ocular, facial, pharyngeal and distal limb muscle 
      involvement. Trinucleotide repeat expansions in LRP12 or GIPC1 were recently 
      reported to be associated with OPDM. However, a significant portion of OPDM 
      patients have unknown genetic causes. In this study, long-read whole-genome 
      sequencing and repeat-primed PCR were performed and we identified GGC repeat 
      expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene in 16.7% (4/24) of a cohort of Chinese OPDM 
      patients, designated as OPDM type 3 (OPDM3). Methylation analysis indicated that 
      methylation levels of the NOTCH2NLC gene were unaltered in OPDM3 patients, but 
      increased significantly in asymptomatic carriers. Quantitative real-time PCR 
      analysis indicated that NOTCH2NLC mRNA levels were increased in muscle but not in 
      blood of OPDM3 patients. Immunofluorescence on OPDM muscle samples and expressing 
      mutant NOTCH2NLC with (GGC)69 repeat expansions in HEK293 cells indicated that 
      mutant NOTCH2NLC-polyglycine protein might be a major component of intranuclear 
      inclusions, and contribute to toxicity in cultured cells. In addition, two 
      RNA-binding proteins, hnRNP A/B and MBNL1, were both co-localized with p62 in 
      intranuclear inclusions in OPDM muscle samples. These results indicated that a 
      toxic protein gain-of-function mechanism and RNA gain-of-function mechanism may 
      both play a vital role in the pathogenic processes of OPDM3. This study extended 
      the spectrum of NOTCH2NLC repeat expansion-related diseases to a predominant 
      myopathy phenotype presenting as OPDM, and provided evidence for possible 
      pathogenesis of these diseases.

AB  - Background: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare 
      neurodegenerative disease. Because of variable clinical manifestations, NIID was 
      often misdiagnosed. According to published case reports, the common clinical 
      manifestations of NIID include dementia, muscle weakness, autonomic impairment, 
      sensory disturbance, rigidity, ataxia convulsions, etc. However, no cases of 
      oromandibular dystonia were mentioned. Case Presentation: We describe a case of a 
      58-year-old woman presenting with mouth involuntary chewing initially. She 
      started to show hand tremors, ataxia, and walking instability until 2 years 
      later. Diffusion-weighted imaging showed high intensity signal along the 
      corticomedullary junction. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging showed 
      white matter hyperintensity. Electromyography (EMG) indicated peripheral nerve 
      degeneration. Neuropsychological testing showed memory loss. Finally, skin biopsy 
      and GGC repeat expansions in the NOTCH2NLC (Notch 2 N-terminal like C) gene 
      confirmed the diagnosis of NIID. Conclusion: This case demonstrated that 
      oromandibular dystonia could be the first symptom of NIID. This case report 
      provides new characteristics of NIID and broadens its clinical spectrum.

AB  - Here, we describe the generation of an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line, 
      from a female patient diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD). The patient 
      carries a heterozygous intermediate-length GGC repeat expansions mutation in the 
      NOTCH2NLC gene. Skin fibroblasts were reprogrammed using the non-integrating 
      Sendai virus technology to deliver Klf4, OCT3/4, SOX2 and c-MYC factors. The 
      generated iPSC line (ZZUi020-A) presented with expression of common pluripotency 
      markers, showed potential of differentiating into derivatives of the three germ 
      layers, and displayed a normal karyotype. The clone ZZUi020-A is presented 
      thereafter, it can be used to study the mechanisms underlying NOTCH2NLC-PD 
      pathogenesis.

AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a heterogeneous 
      neurodegenerative disease with multiple clinical subtypes. Recent breakthroughs 
      on neuroimaging, skin biopsy and genetic testing have facilitated the diagnosis. 
      We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics of Chinese NIID patients to 
      further refine the spectrum. We analyzed the clinical features of 25 NIID 
      patients from 24 unrelated families and performed skin biopsy and/or sural nerve 
      biopsy on 24 probands. Repeat-primed PCR and fluorescence amplicon length PCR 
      were conducted to detect GGC repeats of NOTCH2NLC. Onset age ranged from 24 to 
      72 years old, and the disease duration ranged from 12 h to 25 years with the mode 
      of onset characterized as acute, recurrent or chronic progressive type. Tremor 
      was a common phenotype, often observed in the early stages, next to dementia and 
      paroxysmal encephalopathy. Symptoms infrequently reported such as oromandibular 
      dystonia, recurrent vomiting, dizziness and headache of unknown origin, as well 
      as pure peripheral neuropathy were also suggestive of NIID. Reversible 
      leukoencephalopathy following encephalitic episodes and the absence of apparent 
      DWI abnormality were noticed. Two genetically confirmed NIID patients failed to 
      be identified intranuclear inclusions, and one patient was simultaneously found 
      significant mitochondrial swelling and fingerprint profiles depositing in 
      lysosomes. All the patients were identified abnormal GGC repeats of NOTCH2NLC. We 
      identify some atypical clinicopathological features and consider that 
      pathological examinations combined with genetic testing is the gold standard for 
      diagnosis. Whether lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in the 
      pathogenesis of NIID deserves further study.

TI  - CGG expansion in NOTCH2NLC is associated with oculopharyngodistal myopathy with 
      neurological manifestations.

AB  - Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is a rare hereditary muscle disease 
      characterized by progressive distal limb weakness, ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, 
      bulbar muscle weakness and rimmed vacuoles on muscle biopsy. Recently, CGG repeat 
      expansions in the noncoding regions of two genes, LRP12 and GIPC1, have been 
      reported to be causative for OPDM. Furthermore, neuronal intranuclear inclusion 
      disease (NIID) has been recently reported to be caused by CGG repeat expansions 
      in NOTCH2NLC. We aimed to identify and to clinicopathologically characterize 
      patients with OPDM who have CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC (OPDM_NOTCH2NLC). 
      Note that 211 patients from 201 families, who were clinically or 
      clinicopathologically diagnosed with OPDM or oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, 
      were screened for CGG expansions in NOTCH2NLC by repeat primed-PCR. Clinical 
      information and muscle pathology slides of identified patients with 
      OPDM_NOTCH2NLC were re-reviewed. Intra-myonuclear inclusions were evaluated using 
      immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy (EM). Seven Japanese OPDM patients 
      had CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC. All seven patients clinically 
      demonstrated ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, dysarthria and muscle weakness; they 
      myopathologically had intra-myonuclear inclusions stained with 
      anti-poly-ubiquitinated proteins, anti-SUMO1 and anti-p62 antibodies, which were 
      diagnostic of NIID (typically on skin biopsy), in addition to rimmed vacuoles. 
      The sample for EM was available only from one patient, which demonstrated 
      intranuclear inclusions of 12.6 +/- 1.6 nm in diameter. We identified seven 
      patients with OPDM_NOTCH2NLC. Our patients had various additional central and/or 
      peripheral nervous system involvement, although all were clinicopathologically 
      compatible; thus, they were diagnosed as having OPDM and expanding a phenotype of 
      the neuromyodegenerative disease caused by CGG repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC.

TI  - Low Prevalence of NOTCH2NLC GGC Repeat Expansion in White Patients with Movement 
      Disorders.
PG  - 251-255
LID - 10.1002/mds.28302 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of the 
      GGC-repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC in whites presenting with movement disorders. 
      METHODS: We searched for the GGC-repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC using 
      repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction in 203 patients with essential tremor, 
      825 patients with PD, 194 patients with spinocerebellar ataxia, 207 patients with 
      "possible" or "probable" MSA, and 336 patients with pathologically confirmed MSA. 
      We also screened 30,008 patients enrolled in the 100,000 Genomes Project for the 
      same mutation using ExpansionHunter, followed by repeat-primed polymerase chain 
      reaction. All possible expansions were confirmed by Southern blotting and/or 
      long-read sequencing. RESULTS: We identified 1 patient who carried the NOTCH2NLC 
      mutation in the essential tremor cohort, and 1 patient presenting with recurrent 
      encephalopathy and postural tremor/parkinsonism in the 100,000 Genomes Project. 
      CONCLUSIONS: GGC-repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC is rare in whites presenting with 
      movement disorders. In addition, existing whole-genome sequencing data are useful 
      in case ascertainment. (c) 2020 The Authors. Movement Disorders published by Wiley

AB  - NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions were recently identified in neuronal intranuclear 
      inclusion disease (NIID); however, it remains unclear whether they occur in other 
      neurodegenerative disorders. This study aimed to investigate the role of 
      intermediate-length NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions in Parkinson disease (PD). We 
      screened for GGC repeat expansions in a cohort of 1,011 PD patients and 
      identified 11 patients with intermediate-length repeat expansions ranging from 41 
      to 52 repeats, with no repeat expansions in 1,134 controls. Skin biopsy revealed 
      phospho-alpha-synuclein deposition, confirming the PD diagnosis in 2 patients 
      harboring intermediate-length repeat expansions instead of NIID or essential 
      tremor. Fibroblasts from PD patients harboring intermediate-length repeat 
      expansions revealed NOTCH2NLC upregulation and autophagic dysfunction. Our 
      results suggest that intermediate-length repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC are 
      potentially associated with PD. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:182-187.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the GGC repeats in the NOTCH2NLC gene contribute 
      to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). METHODS: In this study, 545 patients with 
      ALS and 1,305 healthy controls from mainland China were recruited. Several 
      pathogenic mutations in known ALS-causative genes (including C9ORF72 and ATXN2) 
      and polynucleotide repeat expansions in NOP56 and AR genes were excluded. 
      Repeat-primed PCR and GC-rich PCR were performed to determine the GGC repeat size 
      in NOTCH2NLC. Systematic and targeted clinical evaluations and investigations, 
      including skin biopsy and dynamic electrophysiologic studies, were conducted in 
      the genetically affected patients. RESULTS: GGC repeat expansion was observed in 
      4 patients (numbers of repeats 44, 54, 96, and 143), accounting for  approximately 0.73% (4 of 
      545) of all patients with ALS. A comparison with 1,305 healthy controls revealed 
      that GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC was associated with ALS (Fisher exact 
      test, 4 of 545 vs 0 of 1,305, p = 0.007). Compared to patients with the neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) muscle weakness-dominant subtype, patients 
      with ALS phenotype carrying the abnormal repeat expansion tended to have a severe 
      phenotype and rapid deterioration. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ALS is a 
      specific phenotype of NIID or that GGC expansion in NOTCH2NLC is a factor that 
      modifies ALS. These findings may help clarify the pathogenic mechanism of ALS and 
      may expand the known clinical spectrum of NIID.

AB  - PURPOSE: To report the ocular characteristics of neuronal intranuclear inclusion 
      disease (NIID)-related retinopathy with expansion of the CGG repeats in the 
      NOTCH2NLC gene. METHODS: Seven patients from six families (aged 66-81 years) 
      diagnosed with adult-onset NIID were studied. Ophthalmologic examinations, 
      including the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), Goldmann perimetry, fundus 
      photography, fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging, optical coherence tomography 
      (OCT), and full-field electroretinography (ERGs), were performed. The expansion 
      of the CGG repeats in the NOTCH2NLC gene was determined. RESULTS: All patients 
      had an expansion of the CGG repeats (length approximately from 330-520 bp) in the 
      NOTCH2NLC gene. The most common symptoms of the five symptomatic cases were 
      reduced BCVA and night blindness. The other two cases did not have any ocular 
      symptoms. The decimal BCVA varied from 0.15 to 1.2. Goldmann perimetry was 
      constricted in all four cases tested; physiological blind spot was enlarged in 
      two of the cases. The FAF images showed an absence of autofluorescence (AF) 
      around the optic disc in all cases and also showed mild hypo-AF or extinguished 
      AF in the midperiphery. In all cases, the OCT images showed an absence of the 
      ellipsoid zone of the photoreceptors in the peripapillary region, and 
      hyperreflective dots were also present between the retinal ganglion cell layer 
      and outer nuclear layer. The macular region was involved in the late stage of the 
      retinopathy. The full-field ERGs showed rod-cone dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Patients with adult-onset NIID with CGG repeats expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene 
      had similar ophthalmologic features, including rod-cone dysfunction with 
      progressive retinal degeneration in the peripapillary and midperipheral regions. 
      The primary site is most likely the photoreceptors. Because the ocular symptoms 
      are often overlooked due to dementia and occasionally precede the onset of 
      dementia, detailed ophthalmological examinations are important for the early 
      diagnosis of NIID-related retinopathy.

TI  - Association of NOTCH2NLC Repeat Expansions With Parkinson Disease.
PG  - 1559-1563
LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2020.3023 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The presence of Notch homolog 2 N-terminal-like C (NOTCH2NLC) repeat 
      expansions are associated with neuronal intranuclear inclusion body disease 
      (NIID), with varied neurological signs, including neuropathy, ataxia, 
      parkinsonism, and tremor. To date, genetic screening of NOTCH2NLC GGC repeats in 
      a cohort with typical Parkinson disease (PD) appears not to have been reported. 
      OBJECTIVE: To investigate if NOTCH2NLC GGC expansions are present in a cohort of 
      patients with PD and controls. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 
      case-control study was conducted in 2 tertiary movement disorder centers in 
      Singapore. Participants were recruited and followed up from January 2005 to 
      January 2020. The presence of NOTCH2NLC GGC expansion repeats was screened using 
      polymerase chain reaction tests, and representative samples were verified with 
      long-read genome sequencing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Qualitative and 
      quantitative comparisons between participants with sporadic PD, healthy control 
      participants, and individuals with NIID. RESULTS: A total of 2076 participants, 
      including 1000 with sporadic PD (600 men [60.0%]; mean age at onset, 62.6 [7.7] 
      years) and 1076 healthy controls (581 men [54.0%]; mean age at study recruitment, 
      54.9 [9.4] years) were recruited. A total of 13 patients with PD and no healthy 
      control participants were identified as carrying NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions 
      of more than 40 units; the frequency of more than 40 repeat expansions was higher 
      in participants with PD than controls (P < .001). None of the patients with PD 
      were carriers of known PD-associated genes. Ten patients with PD carried a GGC 
      expansion of between 41 and 64 repeats (1% of patients with sporadic PD; mean 
      [SD], 49.4 [9.2] repeats). The other 3 patients carried GGC repeats of 79 or more 
      units, 2 with 122 and 79 repeats, respectively, exhibited typical parkinsonism 
      and were responsive to small dosages of levodopa over many years, with no 
      clinical or imaging features of NIID. The other patient with PD, who had 130 
      repeats, only developed cognitive impairment before death. Within the GGC 
      expansions, there was no GGA interruptions (mean [SD] GGA percentage in the 3 
      patients with PD vs patients with NIID, 0% vs 12% [9%]), and the frequency of AGC 
      interruptions was 3 times higher in these patients with PD than patients with 
      NIID (mean [SD], 25% [12%] vs 8% [8%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study 
      demonstrated that individuals with sporadic PD who carried pathogenic NOTCH2NLC 
      GGC repeat expansions can present with typical parkinsonism, requiring only low 
      dosages of levodopa, without displaying other clinical or imaging features of 
      NIID even after several years of follow-up. None of the patients with PD had GGA 
      interruptions within their GGC expansions, and the frequency of AGC interruptions 
      was much higher than that of patients with NIID. The functional significance of a 
      higher moderate repeat expansion in patients with PD compared with healthy 
      controls needs to be further investigated.

TI  - NOTCH2NLC CGG Repeats Are Not Expanded and Skin Biopsy Was Negative in an 
      Infantile Patient With Neuronal Intranuclear Inclusion Disease.
PG  - 1065-1071
LID - 10.1093/jnen/nlaa070 [doi]
AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a progressive neurodegenerative 
      disorder categorized into 3 phenotypic variants: infantile, juvenile, and adult. 
      Four recent reports have linked NIID to CGG expansions in the NOTCH2NLC gene in 
      adult NIID (aNIID) and several juvenile patients. Infantile NIID (iNIID) is an 
      extremely rare neuropediatric condition. We present a 7-year-old male patient 
      with severe progressive neurodegenerative disease that included cerebellar 
      symptoms with cerebellar atrophy on brain MRI, psychomotor developmental 
      regression, pseudobulbar syndrome, and polyneuropathy. The diagnosis of iNIID was 
      established through a postmortem neuropathology work-up. We performed long-read 
      sequencing of the critical NOTCH2NLC repeat motif and found no expansion in the 
      patient. We also re-evaluated an antemortem skin biopsy that was collected when 
      the patient was 2 years and 8 months old and did not identify the intranuclear 
      inclusions. In our report, we highlight that the 2 methods (skin biopsy and CGG 
      expansion testing in NOTCH2NLC) used to identify aNIID patients may provide 
      negative results in iNIID patients.

TI  - A case of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease with recurrent vomiting and 
      without apparent DWI abnormality for the first seven years.

LID - e04675
AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare, neurodegenerative 
      disorder characterized by the presence of eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear 
      inclusions, which are ubiquitin-positive and p62-positive, in neuronal and 
      somatic cells; this can be observed on skin biopsy. Although patients with NIID 
      present with a variety of symptoms that often make the diagnosis difficult, 
      characteristic high-signal intensity of the corticomedullary junction on 
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) often provides a clue to the diagnosis of NIID. 
      We present a case of NIID in a 57-year-old woman who only had recurrent vomiting 
      for four years, which is uncommon as the presenting symptom; moreover, DWI showed 
      no apparent abnormality until a slightly abnormal intensity lesion appeared at 
      the right frontal corticomedullary junction seven years after the first episode 
      of recurrent vomiting. Skin biopsies revealed multiple p62-positive nuclear 
      inclusions, and genetic test showed GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC; this may 
      form the genetic basis for NIID. Retrospectively, we found that abnormal 
      cerebellar signals besides the vermis in the fluid attenuation inversion recovery 
      (FLAIR) images were detected early-on in the disease. Periodic vomiting may be 
      the only symptom of NIID in the early stages of the disease, and cerebellar 
      abnormalities in FLAIR may serve as an important finding in the diagnosis of 
      NIID, even in the absence of characteristic clinical symptoms or abnormal DWI 
      signals at the cerebral corticomedullary junction.

AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a clinically heterogeneous 
      neurodegenerative condition characterized by pathological intranuclear 
      eosinophilic inclusions. A CGG repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC was recently 
      identified to be associated with NIID in patients of Japanese descent. We 
      screened pathologically confirmed European NIID, cases of neurodegenerative 
      disease with intranuclear inclusions and applied in silico-based screening using 
      whole-genome sequencing data from 20 536 participants in the 100 000 Genomes 
      Project. We identified a single European case harbouring the pathogenic repeat 
      expansion with a distinct haplotype structure. Thus, we propose new diagnostic 
      criteria as European NIID represents a distinct disease entity from East Asian 
      cases.

AB  - Recent studies have identified an expanded GGC repeat in the 5' untranslated 
      region of the NOTCH2NLC gene as a possible pathogenic genetic cause of neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusion disease. Converging evidence verifying the presence of the 
      same GGC repeat expansion in patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
      disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases has also received increased 
      attention. Inspired by some of the clinical similarities between neuronal 
      intranuclear inclusion disease and multiple system atrophy (MSA), we used 
      repeat-primed PCR to explore the occurrence of GGC repeats in 328 patients with 
      MSA in mainland China. Our result failed to detect any GGC repeat expansion in 
      these patients with MSA, indicating that the NOTCH2NLC gene may not be involved 
      in the pathogenesis of MSA.

PG  - 274-281

AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
      associated with GGC repeats of >60 to 500 copies in the 5'-untranslated region of 
      NOTCH2NLC. The clinical and genetic characterization of NIID outside of East Asia 
      remains unknown. We identified twelve patients who underwent genetic testing 
      using long-read sequencing or repeat primed polymerase chain reaction. All were 
      positive for a GGC repeat expansion; the median repeat length was 107 (range 
      92-138). Ten were Chinese and two of Malay ethnicity. Age at onset ranged from 50 
      to 69 years. Eight (66.7%) patients had dementia, while four (33.3%) patients 
      were oligosymptomatic, without typical NIID symptoms of dementia, Parkinsonism, 
      or muscle weakness. GGA interruptions within the GGC expansion were present in 
      four patients; the number of GGA interruptions was highest (6.71%) in the patient 
      with the earliest age at onset (50 years). Median plasma neurofilament light 
      level was 47.3 pg/mL in seven patients (range 26-380 pg/mL). The highest level 
      (380 pg/mL) was found in one patient who experienced an encephalitic episode. 
      Overall, we describe a cohort of genetically confirmed NIID patients from 
      Southeast Asia and provide further information that the presence of GGA 
      interruptions within GGC repeat expansions may serve as a potential genetic 
      modifier in NIID.

TI  - Clinical and pathological features in adult-onset NIID patients with cortical 
      enhancement.
PG  - 3187-3198
LID - 10.1007/s00415-020-09945-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a neurodegenerative 
      disease characterized by eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions in multiple 
      organs. On conventional MRI, high signals on diffused weight image (DWI) along 
      the corticomedullary junction have demonstrated great diagnostic values for 
      adult-onset NIID. However, changes of contrast MRI in the acute period of the 
      encephalopathy-like episode have rarely been investigated. METHODS: Patients with 
      enhanced lesions were retrieved in our database including 35 patients with 
      adult-onset NIID between October 2017 and December 2019. Conventional and 
      contrast MRI were conducted in all patients. Standard procedures of skin biopsy 
      were performed in all patients. Repeat-primed PCR and amplicon length PCR were 
      used to screen the GGC expansion in the 5'UTR of the NOTCH2NLC gene. RESULTS: 
      Four of 35 patients (11.4%) were identified to have a cortical enhancement in 
      this study. The enhanced lesions were selectively spread along the surface of 
      posterior cortex and were clinically associated with encephalopathy-like 
      episodes. These patients had a younger age of onset, shorter duration of disease, 
      and a higher incidence of a headache than those without enhancement. Typical 
      p62-postive intranuclear inclusions were observed in all patients, while patient 
      1 simultaneously had many nuclei full of abnormal substance immunopositive to 
      p62, as well as short-curly filament materials on electron microscopy. All 
      patients were identified to have GGC repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene. 
      CONCLUSION: Post-contrast MRI should be routinely performed in the adult-onset 
      NIID patients. Some patients with adult-onset NIID showed cortical enhancement 
      and edema along the surface of posterior cortex, indicating that dehydrate and 
      anti-inflammatory drugs might be potential therapies for these patients.

AB  - We screened 662 subjects comprising 462 essential tremor (ET) subjects (285 
      sporadic, 125 with family history, and 52 probands from well-characterized ET 
      pedigrees) and 200 controls and identified pathogenic NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat 
      expansions in 4 sporadic ET patients. Two patients were followed up for >1 
      decade; one with 90 repeats remained an ET phenotype that did not evolve after 
      40 years, whereas another patient with 107 repeats developed motor symptoms and 
      cognitive impairment after 8 to 10 years. Neuroimaging in this patient revealed 
      severe leukoencephalopathy; diffusion-weighted imaging hyperintensity in the 
      corticomedullary junction and skin biopsy revealed intranuclear inclusions 
      suggestive of intranuclear inclusion body disease (NIID). No GGC repeats of 
      >60 units were detected in familial ET cases and controls, although 4 ET patients 
      carried 47 to 53 "intermediate" repeats. NOTCH2NLC GGC repeat expansions can be 
      associated with sporadic ET. Carriers presenting with a pure ET phenotype may or 
      may not convert to NIID up to 4 decades after initial tremor onset. ANN NEUROL

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a rare 
      neurodegenerative condition characterized by the loss of neurons and the presence 
      of eosinophilic nuclear inclusions in the central and peripheral nervous system, 
      skin and visceral organs. In this paper, we present a case of NIID with recurrent 
      encephalitic attacks that remained stable and nonprogressive for seven years; no 
      such case has previously been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old female 
      was hospitalized due to light-headedness, vomiting, unstable gait and cognitive 
      impairment. Seven years prior, she had experienced an episode of 
      light-headedness, central facial paralysis, unstable gait, aphasia, nausea, 
      vomiting and loss of consciousness. She regained consciousness within 12 h, and 
      her other symptoms were completely resolved within one week. During the present 
      hospitalization, a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination detected 
      high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the bilateral 
      frontal grey matter-white matter junction. We reviewed the patient's previous MRI 
      results and found that she had also had high signal intensity on DWI of the 
      bilateral frontal grey matter-white matter junction seven years prior. In the 
      intervening seven years, the high signal intensity in the frontal lobes had 
      spread along the grey matter-white matter junction, but the deep white matter 
      remained unaffected. Skin biopsy was performed, and intranuclear inclusions were 
      found in adipocytes, fibroblasts and sweat gland cells. GGC repeat expansions in 
      the NOTCH2NLC (Notch 2 N-terminal like C) gene confirmed the diagnosis of NIID. 
      She received supportive treatment such as nutrition support therapy and vitamin B 
      and C supplementation, as well as symptomatic treatment during hospitalization. 
      The patient's symptoms were completely relieved within one week. CONCLUSION: This 
      is a detailed report of a case of NIID with multiple reversible encephalitic 
      attacks, diagnosed by clinical symptoms, intranuclear inclusions, characteristic 
      DWI signals, and genetic tests.

TI  - Repeat expansion scanning of the NOTCH2NLC gene in patients with multiple system 
      atrophy.
PG  - 517-526
LID - 10.1002/acn3.51021 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Trinucleotide GGC repeat expansion in the 5'UTR of the NOTCH2NLC gene 
      has been recognized as the pathogenesis of neuronal intranuclear inclusion 
      disease (NIID). Previous studies have described that some NIID patients showed 
      clinical and pathological similarities with multiple system atrophy (MSA). This 
      study aimed to address the possibility that GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC 
      might be associated with some cases diagnosed as MSA. METHODS: A total of 189 
      patients with probable or possible MSA were recruited to screen for GGC repeat 
      expansion in NOTCH2NLC by repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). In addition, long-read 
      sequencing (LRS) was performed for all patients with RP-PCR-positive expansion, 
      five patients with RP-PCR-negative expansion, and five controls on the Nanopore 
      platform. Skin biopsies were performed on two patients with GGC expansion. 
      RESULTS: Five of 189 patients (2.6%) were found to have GGC expansion in 
      NOTCH2NLC. LRS results identified that the five patients had GGC expansion 
      between 101 and 266, but five patients with RP-PCR-negative expansion and five 
      controls had GGC expansion between 8 and 29. Besides the typical symptoms and 
      signs of MSA, patients with GGC expansion might have longer disease duration, 
      severe urinary retention, and prominent cognitive impairment. In the skin samples 
      from the patients with GGC expansion, typical p62-postive but 
      alpha-synuclein-negative intranuclear inclusions were found in fibroblasts, 
      adipocyte and ductal epithelial cells of sweat glands. CONCLUSION: Trinucleotide 
      GGC repeat expansion in NOTCH2NLC could be observed in patients with clinically 
      diagnosed MSA. Adult-onset NIID should be considered as a differential diagnosis 
      of MSA.

AB  - Recently, the (GGC)(n) repeat expansion in the NOTCH2NLC gene has been identified 
      to be associated with neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID). Given the 
      clinical overlap of dementia-dominant NIID with neurodegenerative dementia, we 
      therefore hypothesized that the NOTCH2NLC repeat expansion might also contribute 
      to these diseases. In the present study, repeat primed polymerase chain reaction 
      (RP-PCR) and GC-rich PCR were conducted to detect the repeats of NOTCH2NLC in a 
      cohort of 1004 patients with neurodegenerative dementias from mainland China. As 
      a result, 4 sporadic patients were found to carry the NOTCH2NLC repeats 
      expansion, totally accounting for 0.4% of all dementia individuals, and the 
      accurate repeated sizes were 110, 133,120 and 76 respectively. Of 4 mutation 
      carriers, three and one were clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD) respectively. In addition, 3 out of them revealed 
      leukoencephalopathy in T2-Flair imaging. This study revealed that although rare, 
      the NOTCH2NLC repeat expansions may be associated with AD or FTD-like phenotype 
      as well as leukoencephalopathy.

TI  - Expansion of GGC repeat in the human-specific NOTCH2NLC gene is associated with 
      essential tremor.
PG  - 222-233

AB  - Essential tremor is one of the most common movement disorders. Despite its high 
      prevalence and heritability, the genetic aetiology of essential tremor remains 
      elusive. Up to now, only a few genes/loci have been identified, but these genes 
      have not been replicated in other essential tremor families or cohorts. Here we 
      report a genetic study in a cohort of 197 Chinese pedigrees clinically diagnosed 
      with essential tremor. Using a comprehensive strategy combining linkage analysis, 
      whole-exome sequencing, long-read whole-genome sequencing, repeat-primed 
      polymerase chain reaction and GC-rich polymerase chain reaction, we identified an 
      abnormal GGC repeat expansion in the 5' region of the NOTCH2NLC gene that 
      co-segregated with disease in 11 essential tremor families (5.58%) from our 
      cohort. Clinically, probands that had an abnormal GGC repeat expansion were found 
      to have more severe tremor phenotypes, lower activities of daily living ability. 
      Obvious genetic anticipation was also detected in these 11 essential 
      tremor-positive families. These results indicate that abnormal GGC repeat 
      expansion in the 5' region of NOTCH2NLC gene is associated with essential tremor, 
      and provide strong evidence that essential tremor is a family of diseases with 
      high clinical and genetic heterogeneities.

AB  - Leukoencephalopathies comprise a broad spectrum of disorders, but the genetic 
      background of adult leukoencephalopathies has rarely been assessed. In this 
      study, we analyzed 101 Japanese patients with genetically unresolved adult 
      leukoencephalopathy using whole-exome sequencing and repeat-primed polymerase 
      chain reaction for detecting GGC expansion in NOTCH2NLC. NOTCH2NLC was recently 
      identified as the cause of neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease. We found 12 
      patients with GGC expansion in NOTCH2NLC as the most frequent cause of adult 
      leukoencephalopathy followed by NOTCH3 variants in our cohort. Furthermore, we 
      found 1 case with de novo GGC expansion, which might explain the underlying 
      pathogenesis of sporadic cases. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:962-968.

TI  - Long-read sequencing identified repeat expansions in the 5'UTR of the NOTCH2NLC 
      gene from Chinese patients with neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease.
PG  - 758-764
LID - 10.1136/jmedgenet-2019-106268 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a heterogenous 
      neurodegenerative disorder named after its pathological features. It has long 
      been considered a disease of genetic origin. Recently, the GGC repeated expansion 
      in the 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR) of the NOTCH2NLC gene has been found in 
      adult-onset NIID in Japanese individuals. This study was aimed to investigate the 
      causative mutations of NIID in Chinese patients. METHODS: Fifteen patients with 
      NIID were identified from five academic neurological centres. Biopsied skin 
      samples were analysed by histological staining, immunostaining and electron 
      microscopic observation. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and long-read sequencing 
      (LRS) were initially performed in three patients with NIID. Repeat-primed PCR was 
      conducted to confirm the genetic variations in the three patients and the other 
      12 cases. RESULTS: Our patients included 14 adult-onset patients and 1 
      juvenile-onset patient characterised by degeneration of multiple nervous systems. 
      All patients were identified with intranuclear inclusions in the nuclei of 
      fibroblasts, fat cells and ductal epithelial cells of sweat glands. The WGS 
      failed to find any likely pathogenic variations for NIID. The LRS successfully 
      identified that three patients with adult-onset NIID showed abnormalities of GGC 
      expansion in 5'UTR of the NOTCH2NLC gene. The GGC repeated expansion was further 
      confirmed by repeat-primed PCR in seven familial cases and eight sporadic cases. 
      CONCLUSION: Our findings provided evidence that confirmed the GGC repeated 
      expansion in the 5'UTR of the NOTCH2NLC gene is associated with the pathogenesis 
      of NIID. Additionally, the GGC expansion was not only responsible for adult-onset 
      patients, but also responsible for juvenile-onset patients.

TI  - Long-read sequencing identifies GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC associated 
      with neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease.
PG  - 1215-1221

AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a progressive neurodegenerative 
      disease that is characterized by eosinophilic hyaline intranuclear inclusions in 
      neuronal and somatic cells. The wide range of clinical manifestations in NIID 
      makes ante-mortem diagnosis difficult(1-8), but skin biopsy enables its 
      ante-mortem diagnosis(9-12). The average onset age is 59.7 years among 
      approximately 140 NIID cases consisting of mostly sporadic and several familial 
      cases. By linkage mapping of a large NIID family with several affected members 
      (Family 1), we identified a 58.1 Mb linked region at 1p22.1-q21.3 with a maximum 
      logarithm of the odds score of 4.21. By long-read sequencing, we identified a GGC 
      repeat expansion in the 5' region of NOTCH2NLC (Notch 2 N-terminal like C) in all 
      affected family members. Furthermore, we found similar expansions in 8 unrelated 
      families with NIID and 40 sporadic NIID cases. We observed abnormal anti-sense 
      transcripts in fibroblasts specifically from patients but not unaffected 
      individuals. This work shows that repeat expansion in human-specific NOTCH2NLC, a 
      gene that evolved by segmental duplication, causes a human disease.

TI  - Noncoding CGG repeat expansions in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease, 
      oculopharyngodistal myopathy and an overlapping disease.

AB  - Noncoding repeat expansions cause various neuromuscular diseases, including 
      myotonic dystrophies, fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome, some spinocerebellar 
      ataxias, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and benign adult familial myoclonic 
      epilepsies. Inspired by the striking similarities in the clinical and 
      neuroimaging findings between neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) and 
      fragile X tremor/ataxia syndrome caused by noncoding CGG repeat expansions in 
      FMR1, we directly searched for repeat expansion mutations and identified 
      noncoding CGG repeat expansions in NBPF19 (NOTCH2NLC) as the causative mutations 
      for NIID. Further prompted by the similarities in the clinical and neuroimaging 
      findings with NIID, we identified similar noncoding CGG repeat expansions in two 
      other diseases: oculopharyngeal myopathy with leukoencephalopathy and 
      oculopharyngodistal myopathy, in LOC642361/NUTM2B-AS1 and LRP12, respectively. 
      These findings expand our knowledge of the clinical spectra of diseases caused by 
      expansions of the same repeat motif, and further highlight how directly searching 
      for expanded repeats can help identify mutations underlying diseases.

AB  - Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a slowly progressing 
      neurodegenerative disease characterized by eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions 
      in the nervous system and multiple visceral organs. The clinical manifestation of 
      NIID varies widely, and both familial and sporadic cases have been reported. Here 
      we have performed genetic linkage analysis and mapped the disease locus to 
      1p13.3-q23.1; however, whole-exome sequencing revealed no potential 
      disease-causing mutations. We then performed long-read genome sequencing and 
      identified a large GGC repeat expansion within human-specific NOTCH2NLC. Expanded 
      GGC repeats as the cause of NIID was further confirmed in an additional three 
      NIID-affected families as well as five sporadic NIID-affected case subjects. 
      Moreover, given the clinical heterogeneity of NIID, we examined the size of the 
      GGC repeat among 456 families with a variety of neurological conditions with the 
      known pathogenic genes excluded. Surprisingly, GGC repeat expansion was observed 
      in two Alzheimer disease (AD)-affected families and three parkinsonism-affected 
      families, implicating that the GGC repeat expansions in NOTCH2NLC could also 
      contribute to the pathogenesis of both AD and PD. Therefore, we suggest defining 
      a term NIID-related disorders (NIIDRD), which will include NIID and other related 
      neurodegenerative diseases caused by the expanded GGC repeat within 
      human-specific NOTCH2NLC.
